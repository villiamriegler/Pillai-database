1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 10 October 2018 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Spravato, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 July 2016.  The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of 
significant therapeutic innovation. 
The applicant applied initially for the following indication “treatment resistant depression (Major 
Depressive Disorder in adults who have not responded to at least two different treatments with 
antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode)”. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that   
esketamine was considered to be a known active substance.   
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0020/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), and the granting of a 
product-specific waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, which was declined by CHMP.

Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific advice from the CHMP on the development for the indication from the 
CHMP on 15 November 2012 (EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/2012/III), 24 July 2014 
(EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/2/2014/II), 19 November 2015 (EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/3/2015/I), 21 April 
2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/5/2017/I). The Scientific advice pertained to the following quality, 
non-clinical, and clinical aspects:  
•  Quality aspects, including the development of the intranasal formulation and the intranasal 
delivery system: the applicant ’s choice of starting material used in the manufacture; the use of 
a matrix based testing schedule for registration/validation drug product batches manufactured; 
acceptability of the release testing strategy for vials and intranasal devices; stability protocol and 
approach for manufacturing of registration batches; extractable and leachable testing plan 
•  Adequacy of the non -clinical program including: the proposal for intranasal esketamine 
administration. 
•  Adequacy of the clinical pharmacology program including: the proposal to not perform additional 
studies with inhibitors or inducers of hepatic CYP activity; assessing the disposition of intranasal 
esketamine; data collection to inform on the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery after 
intranasal esketamine administration. 
•  Appropriateness of the phase 3 program to support an authorisation of esketamine in the 
proposed indication (dose selection, primary and secondary endpoints, size of the safety 
database, scales for efficacy and safety assessments, number of EU patients in global program); 
the clinical development program for TRD in elderly patients; suitability of the healthcare 
supervision during esketamine administration.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide according to the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and is associated with a reduction in life expectancy by 10 years. According to 
the latest WHO estimates, more than 300 million individuals worldwide, including 40.2 million in Europe 
and 17.5 million in the US, are living with depression, an increase of more than 18% between 2005 and 
2015. Only about two-thirds of patients with MDD are able to achieve remission after the first or second 
course of treatment using the currently approved drugs. Remission rates following subsequent steps of 
therapy are lower (approximately 13%), and relapse rates are higher and occur more quickly. Patients 
who have not responded to at least 2 different AD treatments, at an adequate dose for an adequate 
duration, in the current depressive episode are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MDD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, which is the fourth leading cause of global disease 
burden and affects about 15 % of the general population. MDD is not a benign disorder, it is associated 
with substantial psychosocial dysfunction and high individual mental strain as well as with excess 
morbidity and mortality - the risk of suicide is considerable.  
Despite the many treatment options currently available for MDD, a relevant proportion of patients up to 
one third do not adequately respond to treatment and up to 20% are considered non-responders, even if 
there is good compliance and the treatment has been taken long enough with an adequate dosage. So 
there is a clear need for patients, in whom even “state of the art”-antidepressant therapy fails to elicit a 
sufficient treatment response. The clinical picture of TRD is common in everyday practice. 
The approved therapeutic indication is:   
Spravato, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant Major 
Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants in 
the current moderate to severe depressive episode 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors  
Depression is currently considered one of the most disabling medical conditions in the world and WHO 
predicts that depression will become the single most important illness in Europe and worldwide by 2030. 
MDD, one of the most common psychiatric disorders, is the fourth leading cause of global disease burden 
and affects about 15% of the general population. Recent meta-analyses from countries across Europe, 
Asia, North and South America, and Australia have found that the rates for 12-month MDD prevalence are 
in the region of 4.1%-4.6%, while recent estimates in US raise this percentage to 6.7% (overall in 
12-month Prevalence of Major Depressive Episode Among U.S. Adults). 
According to facts and figures from WHO, each year, 25% of the population suffer from depression or 
anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders account for 19.5% of the burden of disease in the European 
Region, and 26% in European Union (EU) countries. These disorders account for up to 40% of years lived 
with disability, with depression as the main cause and up to 50% of chronic sick leaves are due to 
depression/anxiety.

2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of treatment resistant depression is not known. Some genetic factors which potentially 
affect response to antidepressants by influencing drug distribution and metabolism, serum and brain drug 
concentrations, and target molecules have been suggested.  Structural and functional abnormalities in 
specific brain regions and neural networks have also been proposed as contributing factors for 
development of TRD. (Schosser et al 2012, GENDEP investigators 2013, Li et al 2015. Serra-Blasco et al 
2013) 
The pathogenesis of unipolar major depression with psychotic features is unknown. Studies have 
identified neurobiologic abnormalities, but it is not clear if these findings represent etiologic causes or 
sequelae because the studies investigated patients after they developed the disorder 
[https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-with-psychotic-features-epidemiology
-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis?search=major%20depression%20pathogenesis&source=s
earch_result&selectedTitle=1~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=1]. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The detection of MDD requires the presence of mood disturbance or loss of interest and pleasure in 
activities accompanied by at least two (ICD-10) or four other symptoms of depression (DSM-5). At least 
one symptom must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure: 
-  Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day 
- 
- 
Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, nearly every day 
Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day 
-  Significant weight loss or weight gain (e.g., 5 percent within a month) or decrease or increase in 
appetite nearly every day 
- 
- 
Psychomotor retardation or agitation nearly every day that is observable by others 
Fatigue or low energy, nearly every day 
-  Decreased ability to concentrate, think, or make decisions, nearly every day 
- 
Thoughts of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, nearly every day 
-  Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt.  
These core symptoms may vary from patient to patient, however, they are typically seen for much of the 
day, almost always every day for at least two weeks and are associated with relevant psychological 
distress and considerable impairment of psychosocial and work functioning. 
Symptoms of TRD follow those of MDD in general, for example depressed mood, loss of interest or 
pleasure, sleep disturbance, fatigue, neurocognitive dysfunction and changes in appetite and weight. 
Compared to patients with non-TRD MDD, patients with TRD show pronounced decreases in daily 
functioning and health-related quality of life. It has been suggested that all-cause mortality or suicide is 
greater in TRD as compared to non-TRD MDD, however the available data is limited. (Fekadu et al 2009, 
Olin et al 2012). Risk of relapse is estimated to be higher in TRD and the probability of remission seems 
to decrease with successive treatment failures. (Rush et al 2003, STAR*D study) 
2.1.5.  Management 
Although there are many oral antidepressant (AD) pharmacotherapies available for use worldwide, all of 
these agents act primarily by modulating the same pathway (monoaminergic system) and require several 
weeks before a full clinical effect on depression symptoms is evident. The conventional treatments over 
the past 50 years have targeted monoamine neurotransmitters, including selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
 
There are several publications discussing the definition and potential treatments of TRD. Quetiapine 
prolonged released tablets (e.g. Seroquel XR) are licensed as add-on treatment of major depressive 
episodes in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had sub-optimal response to 
antidepressant monotherapy; however the population was differently defined in comparison to a 
treatment - resistant population.  
While an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (Symbyax®) has been approved in the USA, there is 
currently no medicinal product specifically authorized for the treatment of TRD available in Europe. In the 
European guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression 
(EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2), the difficulties even in the conceptual elaboration and definition of 
clear criteria for incomplete response and TRD are acknowledged together with the unavailability of 
specific approved treatments for this condition. 
About the product 
Esketamine (the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine) is a known active substance, approved in some 
European Union and Latin American countries, and used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia 
via intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Esketamine nasal spray has been developed as an antidepressant with a novel mechanism of action. It is 
a non-competitive, subtype non-selective, activity-dependent glutamate receptor modulator. The 
antidepressant effect of esketamine is mediated via antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) which produces a transient increase in glutamate release leading to increases in 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) stimulation, leading to an 
array of molecular and cellular events, including increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
expression, synthesis and release, activations of neurotrophic signalling pathway such as extracellular 
signal regulated kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), 
inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, and activation of synaptic plasticity genes such as 
activity-regulated cytoskeleton (ARC)-associated protein. These changes are thought to further induce 
production of synaptic proteins and synaptogenesis, and eventually restoration of synaptic function. 
Additional effects mediated by modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission cannot be excluded. In 
this respect it is noteworthy that acute and prolonged increases in dopamine levels in prefrontal cortex, 
striatum and nucleus accumbens occur immediately after administration of subanesthetic doses of 
esketamine. 
Spravato is a nasal spray formulation of esketamine. The esketamine drug product is a clear and 
colourless solution of esketamine HCl in Water for Injection at a concentration of 161.4 mg/mL and an 
esketamine base equivalent concentration of 140 mg/mL.  
The pharmaceutical form proposed for marketing is a nasal spray solution: 28mg single-use nasal spray 
device. The pack sizes proposed are 1, 2, 3, or 6 nasal spray devices. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following grounds: 
- It was not entirely clear from the efficacy data that esketamine could fulfil the unmet medical need in 
TRD, since one study has shown statistically significant results  
- The strength of evidence is challenged by issues related to study design, in particular lack of esketamine 
only comparison, starting two new treatments at the same time, unexpectedly high response in the AD+ 
intranasal placebo arm as well as reduced magnitude of response in the elderly (in spite of a wide range 
of doses), questioning whether the population was really TRD. All of those warrant a thorough discussion 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 12/13 
 
 
 
 
 
that may not be possible within an accelerated assessment procedure:  
- few substantiation for the claim of major public health interest/ major therapeutic innovation from an 
efficacy or safety perspective    
- the actual amount of safety data from ongoing studies that would be submitted during the procedure is 
hardly predictable and assessment of an important amount of data submitted during the procedure would 
be difficult within an accelerated timetable. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of esketamine hydrochloride is 
(S)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular 
formula C13H16ClNO.HCl. It has a molecular weight of 274.2 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of esketamine hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of mass 
spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR). The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), hot stage microscopy 
(HSM), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). 
The active substance is a white or almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble to 
slightly insoluble in aqueous media over pH range 3.1 - 6.9 and slightly soluble to freely soluble in organic 
solvents. 
Esketamine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Esketamine hydrochloride 
is a single enantiomer of racemic ketamine with the S configuration at C-2 position of the cyclohexanone 
ring. Stereoisomerism arises during the synthesis. The manufacturing process of the active substance 
consists of an optical (racemic) resolution step resulting in a single enantiomer, esketamine obtained by

crystallisation. Enantiomeric purity is routinely controlled in the active substance specifications as well as 
finished product release and shelf-life specifications using chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for esketamine hydrochloride. Only one crystalline form is known 
from literature (Form I). Nevertheless, a polymorph screen was initiated in order to ensure no other 
crystalline forms can be formed. Crystallization experiments were conducted with solvents that cover a 
broad range of properties such as polarity, dielectric constant, boiling point and hydrogen bond donor and 
acceptor propensity. Also included were solvent/water mixtures appropriate to identify possible hydrates. 
The experimental procedures included slurry tests at room and elevated temperature, solvent 
evaporation and cooling crystallization. Only Form I was found in all these experiments. The screening 
studies demonstrated that the active substance does not exhibit polymorphism. These results are 
consistent with the information found in literature. 
The particle size of the active substance does not impact the manufacturability or quality of the finished 
product since the active substance is completely dissolved in the first step of the finished product 
manufacturing process. 
The active substance has a monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), however the 
manufacturers of the active substance have not submitted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for esketamine hydrochloride. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Two suppliers of the active substance are used. For one supplier the detailed information on the 
manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was 
considered satisfactory. For the second supplier, complete information on manufacturing of the active 
substance has been provided in the dossier. 
Active substance manufactured by the ASMF-supported manufacturer was used to produce the finished 
product used in all clinical trials throughout development. The comparability of active substance 
manufactured by both manufacturers has been demonstrated by batch analysis data and characterization 
studies. 
Active substance is synthesized in five or six main steps, respectively, depending on the manufacturer, 
using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. One of the intermediates used in the 
synthesis by the ASMF-supported manufacturer is covered by a valid CEP. 
For the manufacturer supported with complete information on manufacturing in the dossier a criticality 
analysis of the active substance manufacturing process has been performed to identify the critical steps. 
Based on the results obtained the steps 4 (formation of intermediate designed to obtain the 
(S)-enantiomer) and 5 (formation of esketamine hydrochloride) of the active substance synthesis process 
have been determined to have an influence on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the final active 
substance and are therefore designated as critical steps. 
For the ASMF-supported manufacturer critical steps have been clearly defined and in-process controls 
have been adequately described. Appropriate limits have been set for intermediates.  
The development of the manufacturing process has been described showing the differences between 
development batches and registration batches. Only minor changes have been made to optimize the 
manufacturing process and to increase the yield. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags which comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are closed with a twist-tie or equivalent 
and placed in a closed container (plastic drum, fiber drum, or equivalent). Primary packaging of the active 
substance supplied by the ASMF-supported manufacturer are packaged in low density polyethylene film 
which is also in compliance with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), 
identity (IR, HPLC), identification of chloride ion (Ph. Eur.), assay (UHPLC), chromatographic purity 
(UHPLC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPCL), pH value (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Potential impurities Ph. Eur Impurity A, HCl salt of synthesis intermediate (Step 1b), Ph. Eur Impurity B, 
rearrangement product of Impurity C, Ph. Eur Impurity C; synthesis impurity (Step 1b), and Ph. Eur 
Impurity D, enantiomer of the active substance are listed in the Ph. Eur monograph of esketamine 
hydrochloride and are also included in the active substance specification. It has been stated that active 
substance synthesis impurities, carryover impurities from starting and raw materials, as well as 
degradation products are not observed in the active substance above 0.05% (w/w). 
A specific discussion as part of the overall discussion on impurities with regard to their mutagenic 
potential according to ICH M7 guideline has been provided for all known actual and potential impurities 
likely to be present in the active substance. Two SAR prediction methodologies that complement each 
other have been applied: DEREK (an expert rule-based methodology) and Leadscope (a statistical-based 
methodology). In case of a relevant structural alert, a bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames test) has been 
conducted. Based on this mutagenic assessment, the evaluated impurities have been classified with 
respect to carcinogenic and mutagenic potential as defined in ICH M7 guideline. A TTC-based acceptable 
intake of 119 ppm has been calculated when assuming a 10-year impurity dose of 10 µg/day and a 
maximum daily active substance dose of 84 mg/day. A summary of the mutagenicity assessment and 
control has been provided.  
Based on process control and purging factor considerations under the applicable process conditions, they 
are not expected to occur in the final active substance at levels above the TTC-based maximum allowable 
concentration. Therefore, no further specific control of these impurities is required. 
Based on the chemical synthesis route and the bacteriostatic and fungistatic properties of the active 
substance it has been justified that no test for microbiological purity testing is warranted in the active 
substance specification. 
A risk assessment for the potential presence of elemental impurities was conducted in accordance with 
the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities (see also “Product specification” section). Based on that 
no specifications for elemental impurities are required for the active substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data on 11 batches (3 commercial scale and 9 development scale) from one and 20 
batches (4 commercial scale and 16 development scale) from the second manufacturer of the active 
substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale and 4 development scale batches stored in the proposed 
commercial packaging from one manufacturer and 3 commercial scale and 11 development scale batches 
from the second manufacturer stored in the packaging simulating commercial packaging for up to 24 and 
60 months respectively, under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data from the 
first manufacturer included intermediate storage conditions as well. Photostability testing following the 
ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch by each manufacturer. Results on stress conditions 
(thermal, hydrolytic, oxidative and photochemical conditions) were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities, water content and pH value. The 
analytical methods used were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications demonstrating the stability and photostability of the 
active substance. The active substance is stable when exposed to light and requires no special storage 
conditions. The active substance is prone to significant degradation under basic conditions and to some 
minor degradation under oxidative conditions. The active substance is stable under acidic conditions, 
under neutral conditions, and under dry thermal and humidity/thermal conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 and 60 months 
respectively, with no special storage conditions in the proposed container. 
Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Spravato is a buffered, non-preserved aqueous solution containing esketamine hydrochloride as the 
active substance. The finished product is available in one single dosage strength, containing a nominal 
delivered dose of 28 mg esketamine base. The filled and stoppered vials are assembled into a manually 
activated single-use disposable nasal spray device (see Figure 2 below). The device dispenses two sprays 
(one for each nostril) delivering a total volume of 0.2 mL of the finished product.

Figure 2. The SPRAVATO nasal spray device 
Qualitative and quantitative composition of the finished product is provided.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an easy-to-administer esketamine 
formulation, which provides a pharmacokinetic profile comparable to intravenous (IV) administration. An 
intranasal formulation was chosen since it mimics the pharmacokinetic profile of IV dosing, allows for 
rapid systemic absorption and bypasses first pass metabolism. It is less invasive and more patient 
friendly than IV dosing. 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) for the finished product were 
defined and are presented in table 1.

The aqueous solubility of the active substance is approximately 200 mg/mL at room temperature. The 
solubility of the active substance has also been studied in various aqueous buffer systems across the pH 
range. Due to the basic nature of the active substance (pKa = 7.5 in aqueous solution at 20 ºC), the 
solubility is higher at low pH values and begins to drop as the pH rises above 5.0. These solubility 
characteristics support the finished product pH specification range. 
For the development of the nasal spray of esketamine, the HCl salt of the drug was selected since it is 
already commercially available and exhibits chemical and physical stability at the conditions of use (room 
temperature). Also, the hydrochloride salt is freely soluble in water at the pH range which is suitable for 
the preparation of the finished product as a nasal spray solution. 
As described in the active substance stability section, esketamine hydrochloride exhibits good chemical 
stability in the solid state at room temperature and ambient humidity. No impurities have been observed 
in the active substance above the reporting threshold of 0.05% (w/w) in representative batches 
manufactured according to the proposed commercial synthesis at release or during stability testing. 
The finished product is manufactured by dissolving the active substance in aqueous vehicle. The active 
substance is freely soluble in water at the pH range which is the pH of the formulation. Manufacturing 
experiments indicate that the active substance dissolves instantaneously in the formulation vehicle, 
utilizing the process parameters and process equipment proposed for commercial production. Visual 
checks are included in the manufacturing process to ensure all active substance is dissolved following 
mixing. 
Polymorphism is not a factor that will impact finished product manufacturability or performance since 
there is only one form (Form I) of the active substance that can be formed as discussed earlier in this 
report. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Stability studies have demonstrated that during storage of the finished product, the chemical and physical 
quality is maintained throughout the course of the stability studies. During these stability studies, 
real-time and accelerated storage conditions have been studied, and also storage under light conditions 
Assessment report

have been evaluated. The results of these stability studies can be considered as supportive of overall 
excipient compatibility. 
No preservative was used as the QTPP indicated a preference to have a preservative-free formulation and 
because of the antimicrobial properties of the active substance. Spravato nasal spray is not a sterile 
product. 
A concentration of eq.140 mg/mL esketamine free base was selected based on pre-clinical and clinical PK 
studies. Subsequently a nasal spray formulation G001 (esketamine free base eq. 140 mg/mL nasal spray 
solution) was evaluated in Phase 1 studies. G001 is a preservative-free aqueous solution of the 
esketamine hydrochloride in water for injection at a base equivalent concentration of 140 mg/mL and 
adjusted to a final target pH of 4.5 using sodium hydroxide. The addition of penetration enhancers and 
viscosity increasing agents did not offer any relevant benefit and were therefore omitted. Esketamine 
formulations containing low levels of citric acid and EDTA, respectively exhibited improved stability 
compared to G001 and resulted in a stable solution pH over 24 months. The addition of citric acid and 
EDTA was also well tolerated with minimal unilateral histopathological changes. Therefore, formulation 
G005 (an aqueous solution of the esketamine hydrochloride in water for injection at a base equivalent 
concentration of 140 mg/mL, and adjusted to a final target pH of 4.5 using sodium hydroxide) was 
selected for evaluation in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and used in subsequent Phase 1 studies as well. 
This formulation was selected for the final commercial formulation. 
A concentration of eq. 140 mg/mL esketamine in the drug product solution was considered acceptable 
based on solubility of esketamine hydrochloride in the formulation vehicle. This esketamine concentration 
however resulted in a high osmolarity of the nasal solution (approximately 1050 mOsm/kg). The effect of 
the high osmotic pressure on the nasal irritation has been investigated in clinical studies and the 
outcomes demonstrated that the overall nasal tolerability profile was considered to be acceptable. 
The primary packaging is type I glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper. The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The filled and stoppered vials are, subsequently, 
assembled into the nasal spray device. 
The materials of the esketamine primary container closure and the nasal spray device in contact with the 
drug  include  glass,  chlorobutyl  rubber,  stainless  steel  and  polypropylene  and  are  commonly  used  for 
pharmaceutical products. 
An extractable study was performed to determine the extractable and/or potential leachable profiles of 
the primary container closure components including the glass vial and rubber stopper. The objective of 
the  study  was  to  identify  extractables  and  provide  a  semi-quantitative  estimation  of  their  amounts. 
Subsequently, the potential leachables selected from the extractable experiment were followed during a 
leachables study. No organic or inorganic extractables of concern were found in the glass vial and stopper. 
From the list of extractables found for the primary container a selection was made of potential leachables 
which were monitored during the leachables study. Studies to determine the leachables from the Type-I 
glass vials and rubber stoppers were initiated through 36 months of the product to support the shelf-life. 
Through 6 months storage at accelerated conditions (40 °C/25% RH) and 24 months at 30 °C/35% RH, 
none of the compounds identified as potential leachables exceeded the 0.05 µg/vial analytical evaluation 
threshold in the study with the finished product in the primary container closure system. No unexpected 
leachables were observed by screening methods.  
In addition, although the nasal spray device components are not packaged in contact with the finished 
product and have only brief contact, components which could potentially come in contact with the finished 
product,  including,  the  cannula,  spray  pin  and  the actuator,  were  also  evaluated  for extractables  and 
potential leachables. Based on all the data and evaluations for secondary container closure testing, no 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
 
extractables of concern were detected and, as there is only momentary contact with the finished product 
solution, there is no risk of leachables. 
A microbial risk assessment was conducted on the finished product that evaluated the potential sources 
of microbial contamination to the finished product. Adequate risk controls including good manufacturing 
processes  and  routine  cleaning  procedures  have  been  established  to  reduce  the  risk  of  microbial 
contamination for the esketamine nasal spray finished product. In addition, challenge tests conducted on 
the  finished  product  solution  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  solution  is  bacteriostatic  and 
fungistatic. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: compounding, filtration, filling and stoppering, 
assembly and packaging. The process is a standard manufacturing process. 
Filtration and holding steps are considered critical steps and they are controlled with a bulk solution 
holding time. 
The finished product is a solution produced by conventional manufacturing processes such as mixing and 
filled into the container closure system. Process validation will be performed prior to commercial 
distribution of the product. Three consecutive full-scale drug product validation batches will be produced 
at the commercial facility. Each batch will undergo appropriate testing throughout the manufacturing 
process to demonstrate that the manufacturing process consistently produces the finished product 
meeting the proposed specifications. The process validation scheme is provided and found acceptable. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  shown  in  Table  4  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of 
dosage form: appearance, colour and clarity (Ph. Eur.) identification of esketamine (UHPLC, UV), assay 
(UHPLC),  chromatographic  purity  (UHPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (HPLC),  assay  of  disodium  edetate 
(UHPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), and fill volume (Ph. Eur.) 
Release and shelf-life specifications for the drug-device combination product include tests for: 
appearance, appearance of solution, colour and clarity, device manual operation, esketamine 
identification (UHPLC, UV), esketamine assay (UHPLC), assay of disodium edetate, chromatographic 
purity (UHPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), spray content uniformity, droplet size 
distribution, particulate matter, osmolality, fill volume and microbiological purity. Specifications of the 
assembled device were presented. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and 
batch analyses data on 3 batches it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
The finished product primary registration lots and relevant clinical lots were monitored during stability 
studies for weight loss by gravimetrical method for up to 36 months at various conditions. During storage 
at the normal storage conditions and accelerated conditions, the weight loss is quite negligible as could be 
expected for product stored in glass vials (0 to 1%). Therefore, the weight loss test is not considered to

be relevant as a stability indicating test in support of the shelf life of the finished product and is not 
proposed as a commercial specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 31 development/clinical batches, 3 registration batches (15 L each) 
and one scale up batch at proposed commercial batch size (100 L) confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 primary stability batches of a scale size range from 2 – 15 L (or 2 – 15% of the 
commercial batch size) of the finished product manufactured using esketamine hydrochloride from both 
proposed active substance manufacturers and stored in vertical inverted, vertical upright and horizontal 
position for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 40% RH), intermediate conditions (30 
ºC / 35% RH, 30 ºC / 75% RH)) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The stability 
studies represent a complex matrixing stability strategy plan. 
Supportive stability data from 4 batches of filled stoppered vials is also provided. In addition, supportive 
stability data from 2 Phase 3 clinical development batches of filled stoppered vials and combination 
product are also provided. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
Samples were tested for specifications as presented in tables 4 and 5. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed at any of the storage conditions including 
photostability testing except a slight tendency of the EDTA levels to decrease with storage of the finished 
product at the different storage conditions, but this trend is not considered a substantial stability related 
change. The finished product is sufficiently stable when exposed to light. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in 
the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Esketamine is a newly developed non-competitive, subtype non-selective, activity-dependent, 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator to be delivered nasally for use as a rapidly acting 
antidepressant in adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Chemically, esketamine 
(S-ketamine) is the S-enantiomer of ketamine ([R,S]-ketamine) which is the racemic mixture of 50% 
esketamine and 50% arketamine (R-ketamine). Ketamine is marketed as anaesthetic agent applied via 
intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection. Currently, the rapid antidepressant action of IV infused 
ketamine in small-scale clinical investigations in humans at subanaesthetic dose levels was published. A 
typical dosing regimen is 0.5 mg/kg IV infusion over 40 minutes. In the current application JRD developed 
a nasal spray containing esketamine hydrochloride, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) is 
84 mg/person resulting in subanaesthetic plasma levels. 
The pharmacology programme is based on a review of available published literature on ketamine its 
isomers and metabolites, complemented by pharmacodynamic studies and a safety pharmacology core 
battery performed by the Applicant.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Contributors to depression such as stress and other conditions are known to cause structural and 
functional impairment of synapses in brain regions involved with the regulation of mood and emotional 
behaviour. The antidepressant activity of esketamine is supposed to be mediated via inhibition of 
NMDARs which produces a transient increase in glutamate release leading to increases in 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) stimulation that 
subsequently increases neurotrophic signalling and restores synaptic function in these brain regions. In 
order to establish this mode of action the published literature was reviewed and receptor binding studies 
and functional assays on calcium release were performed with ketamine its isomers and several 
metabolites.  
In terms of NMDAR inhibition, esketamine was found to be the most potent as compared to ketamine, 
arketamine or their metabolites. In radioligand binding assays in rat cerebral cortex at the phencyclidine 
(PCP) binding site of the NMDAR, inhibitor constant (Ki)-values for esketamine were in the submicromolar 
range. This is very close to values described in the literature. In assays performed by JRD, esketamine 
was approximately 4-fold more potent than arketamine and 6-fold more potent than the metabolite 
noresketamine (M10). Based on published data esketamine can be considered to be 1.5- to 2.8-fold more 
potent than ketamine in terms of NMDAR inhibition. Esketamine derived metabolites 2S,6S-HNK (M4), 
2S-5,6-DHNK (M9), noresketamine (M10) and keto-reduced 2S,6S-HNK (M19), also bind to NMDARs 
albeit with Ki-values in the micromolar range. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 22/23 
 
 
 
 
Esketamine, arketamine and noresketamine (M10) were active in functional fluorescence imaging plate 
reader (FLIPR) functional assay by measuring calcium flux in CHO cells stably expressing human NMDAR 
subunits at low micromolar concentrations, while other esketamine metabolites were inactive. No major 
differences were observed at different subunit compositions indicating that esketamine is a subtype 
unselective antagonist at the NMDARs. Published studies mainly performed with recombinant NMDAR 
expression systems (mouse/rat and xenopus oocytes) gave similar results with no differences of activities 
at different receptor compositions. Notably, in all experiments esketamine was more potent than 
arketamine under all conditions tested. Similarly, to what was observed in receptor binding studies, patch 
clamp experiments indicate that esketamine is about 2-3-fold more potent at the NMDAR than 
arketamine. 
No dedicated in vivo studies in animal models of depression with (es)ketamine have been performed by 
the Applicant. However, the Applicant reviewed published literature of in vivo models of depression 
performed with either ketamine or esketamine. It is agreed that animal models of depression or 
antidepressant-sensitive behavioural tests are poorly predictive for the human situation. As reviewed in 
detail by the Applicant, many studies indicate antidepressant-like effects of ketamine and arketamine in 
rodent models at higher concentrations which are not reached after intranasal esketamine application 
while little is reported about esketamine effects in respective models. Despite the lack of in vivo studies 
with esketamine it is agreed that based on NMDAR activities of esketamine and sufficient evidence of 
pharmacodynamic activity of esketamine in humans at lower doses, further in vivo studies with 
esketamine would not add further value to the overall assessment. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In order to address secondary pharmacodynamics, apart from a review of data in the public domain, 
esketamine, arketamine, ketamine, and esketamine-derived metabolites were screened in vitro in 
radioligand binding studies for binding on a series of receptors, ion channels and transporters. In addition, 
these compounds were tested in vitro apart from NMDAR for functional, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine-, and 
opioid receptor interactions. Furthermore, ketamine-derived metabolites were investigated for their 
γ-amino butyric acid A (GABAA)-receptor and benzodiazepine (BZD) site binding potential in vitro. In 
conclusion, it is considered unlikely, that esketamine or its isomers and metabolites display relevant 
activities at the tested receptors at clinically relevant concentrations as the estimated maximum brain 
free level of esketamine is 0.8 to 1.3 μM at the MRHD of 84 mg. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology assessment of esketamine was mainly based on dedicated studies performed by 
JRD or Javelin Pharmaceuticals. No relevant safety issues were identified in these studies. A thorough 
review on published data on esketamine’s effects on the cardiovascular system and CNS was performed. 
However, it was concluded that in the majority of studies high anaesthetic doses were applied, which are 
not relevant to the clinical use of esketamine as nasal spray. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The Applicant has submitted a range of pharmacokinetic studies on absorption, plasma kinetics, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of esketamine or ketamine in in vitro- and in vivo test systems. In

its metabolites were conducted. Finally, several other studies were conducted along the development 
process of esketamine, including pharmaco/toxicokinetic studies of specific metabolites and their chiral 
characterization, and a study in simulated gastric fluid to demonstrate the absence of 
N-nitroso-esketamine formation after intranasal esketamine treatment. 
Plasma assays for esketamine and its pharmacologically active metabolite noresketamine were validated 
according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance and European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
guideline on bioanalytical method validation. 
Across species, fast absorption occurred following intranasal administration of esketamine, with peak 
plasma concentrations reached usually within 30 min. The Cmax levels of the active metabolite 
noresketamine were reached somewhat later than those of parent esketamine. 
Single dose data are available in mouse, rat and dog. In mice and rats, mean Cmax values of esketamine 
and noresketamine were comparable whereas the mean AUC values were higher for the metabolite than 
for the parent. Plasma kinetics of esketamine and noresketamine were not linear and tended to increase 
more than dose-proportionally. In the dog, the exposure to noresketamine after intranasal dosing of 
esketamine was up to 3-fold lower than the exposure to esketamine. 
After repeated intranasal dosing of esketamine in mice and rats, noresketamine exposure was higher than 
that of esketamine, whereas in the dog it was the reverse. In the mouse, exposure to esketamine 
increased dose-proportionally, repeat-dose exposure was lower (males) and similar (females) than single 
dose exposure, and there were no major gender differences. In the rat, esketamine AUC values after 
repeated dosing increased generally less than dose-proportionally in males and in females at higher dose 
levels (between 3 and 9 mg), but more than dose-proportionally at lower dose levels (between 0.3 and 3 
mg). The systemic exposure to esketamine and noresketamine was generally lower after repeated than 
after single dosing in the 6-month and 2-year study probably due to autoinduction of esketamine and 
noresketamine metabolising enzymes. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. However, in 
clinical studies no decrease in exposure to esketamine and noresketamine has been observed after 
repeated intermittent administration compared to single administration. Whereas there was no gender 
difference for esketamine and noresketamine exposures in the 2-year study and for esketamine in the 
6-month study, esketamine and noresketamine AUC values were higher in females than in males in the 
3-month study, and the latter was also true for noresketamine in the 6-month study. In the 3- and 
9-month dog toxicity studies, exposure increased generally dose-proportionally up to 48 mg, where a 
plateau was reached. Repeat-dose TK at the end of the 9-month study was similar to TK at the end of the 
first week, and no consistent gender differences were observed. 
In no studies with repeated esketamine application the t1/2 values have been calculated. However, it is 
expected that as for ketamine, the plasma elimination of esketamine is very fast. In a single dose IV study 
in dogs with esketamine, the t1/2 value was 1.29 h. In clinical studies the mean terminal t1/2 in plasma of 
esketamine is 8.1 h. 
After IV administration of esketamine in beagle dogs, a very fast clearance (exceeding liver blood flow) 
and high distribution volume was obtained. The exposure to noresketamine, represented by AUC values, 
after IV dosing was somewhat lower than the exposure to esketamine with a metabolite-to-parent ratio of 
0.77. 
In juvenile rats after SC dosing of esketamine, mean esketamine and noresketamine exposure values 
(Cmax and AUC) increased largely dose-proportionally. Highest esketamine plasma concentrations were 
reached at 15 to 30 min. Accumulation was not observed. In general, the systemic exposure of 
noresketamine was comparable to that of esketamine. 
The tissue distribution of (es)ketamine in rats is characterized by a fast equilibrium between plasma and 
well-perfused tissues leading to a rapid tissue uptake. Brain concentrations of esketamine were 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 24/25 
 
 
 
 
significantly higher compared to those in the systemic circulation. The brain uptake of most more polar 
metabolites (noresketamine [M10], 2S,6S-HNK [M4], 2S-5,6-DHNK [M9]) was less efficient than for the 
parent drug. No radioactive tissue distribution or quantitative whole-body autoradiography study was 
performed for esketamine, which is acceptable due to the non-clinical and clinical data available for 
racemic ketamine and esketamine for use as anaesthetic. 
There is evidence that esketamine crosses the placental barrier. 
In blood, esketamine only marginally distributed to blood cells, as was derived from a blood/plasma 
concentration ratio of about 1 for racemic ketamine in rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs and humans. 
The in vitro PPB of racemic ketamine was low in all species investigated (rat, dog, pig, human), and the 
fraction unbound ranged from about 46 to 72%. The PPB of esketamine was measured in pre-dose plasma 
samples from 2 Phase I single dose open-label studies with esketamine in male subjects with mild or 
moderate hepatic and renal impairment compared to matched subjects with normal hepatic or kidney 
function. The proportion of unbound esketamine in plasma of the cohorts of healthy subjects is on 
average 54.8% and 55.5%. The free fraction of noresketamine in the cohorts of healthy subjects is on 
average 56.4% and 62.0%. The degree to which esketamine is bound to plasma proteins is not 
dependent on hepatic or renal function. 
The major in vitro biotransformation pathway of esketamine in liver microsomes and S9 fractions of 
mouse, rat, dog and human was N-demethylation to noresketamine (M10), followed by hydroxylation on 
different positions of the cyclohexanone ring, oxidative deamination and keto reduction. The metabolism 
was similar between the species and no human specific metabolites have been observed. 
In vitro data indicated that CYP2B6 was the main enzyme involved in esketamine metabolism in human 
liver microsomes, with a contribution close to 60%, and the contribution of CYP3A4 was estimated at 35 
to 40%. CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 were the major enzymes involved in the downstream metabolism of 
noresketamine. 
In rats, 30 to 41% of the radioactive dose was excreted in the 0-24 h urine following IV administration. By 
far the major metabolites were noresketamine and hydroxynoresketamine of which the site of oxidation 
was not further elucidated. Traces of parent esketamine were present in rat urine. 
In humans, following a single PO or IV dose, respectively 86.3% and 78.4% of the radiotracer dose was 
excreted in urine, and less than 2% was excreted in feces. Very low levels of unchanged drug were 
present in urine (less than 1% of the dose), indicating that esketamine is metabolically cleared. 
Metabolites where N-demethylation is involved (i.e. sum of noresketamine (M10) and 23 
noresketamine-derived metabolites) make up 64.0% and 53.7% of the dose following PO and IV dosing, 
respectively, of which noresketamine itself accounts for 3.5 % and 2.3 % of the PO and IV dose, 
respectively. Metabolites where aliphatic hydroxylation is involved (n = 18) make up 44.1% and 36.7% 
of the dose following PO and IV dosing, respectively, and virtually all (except for M8 and M30) are formed 
in combination with N-demethylation. Metabolites where keto-reduction is involved (n = 10) make up 
23.7% and 21.7% of the dose following PO and IV dosing, respectively, and all are formed in combination 
with N-demethylation (M21 and M32) and aliphatic hydroxylation. Metabolites where dehydrogenation is 
involved (i.e. M9 and M14) make up 14.4% and 13.8% of the dose following PO and IV dosing, 
respectively, and all are formed in combination with N-demethylation. N-Oxidation is mainly seen with 
noresketamine in combination with glucuronidation to M17, and in total (+M24 and M25) makes up 
12.3% and 9.4% of the dose following PO and IV dosing, respectively. Metabolites where aromatic 
hydroxylation is involved (n = 4) make up 6.3% and 4.6% of the dose following PO and IV dosing, 
respectively, and all are formed in combination with N-demethylation and aliphatic hydroxylation 
(excluding M15 which does not contribute to the mass balance).

Based on group mean AUC, the 10% threshold of the total exposure to drug and metabolites, is only 
exceeded for noresketamine (M10), accounting for 12 to 14% of the total drug-derived exposure in the 
systemic circulation of humans. All other major phase-1 metabolites and all phase-2 metabolites 
represented less than 10% of the total drug related material in plasma. Similar results were obtained for 
plasma following PO and IV administration. Several other metabolites represent >25% of esketamine 
AUC following a nasal dose of 84 mg esketamine, and were therefore tested for their potential to inhibit 
enzymes or transporters. This was the case for 2S,6S-HNK (M4), 2S,5S-HNK (M5), 2S-5,6-DHNK (M9), 
noresketamine (M10) and keto-reduced 2S,6SHNK (M19). 
Noresketamine (M10) was routinely measured in all clinical trials and in all pivotal in vivo nonclinical 
safety studies. 
Renal is the main route of excretion of esketamine, mainly as its metabolites. After oral and IV 
radiolabelled esketamine administration to healthy male subjects, 86.3% and 78.4% of total radioactivity 
was excreted in urine, respectively. Only 1.70% and 1.81% of the oral and IV radiolabeled doses was 
recovered in feces, respectively, indicating that biliary excretion is not important in man. Less than 1% of 
the dose is excreted as parent esketamine, the majority of the radiolabeled dose is excreted under the 
form of numerous metabolites. Over a time period of 168 h the total radioactivity recovered in human 
feces and urine was 88.0% and 80.3% after PO and IV administration, respectively.  
After IV administration of 14C-labeled esketamine in human, the mean terminal t1/2 of the total 
radioactivity (59.9 h) in plasma was much longer than the terminal t1/2 values of esketamine (8.1 h) and 
noresketamine (M10; 9.8 h). The underlying mechanism leading to this is not completely clear. To some 
extent, this may be indicative for a slow redistribution from tissues, which has been described for 
ketamine in dogs. 
There is evidence that esketamine is excreted in milk. 
The induction potential of esketamine and its major circulating metabolites on CYP450 enzymes is 
expected to be low. Esketamine and its major circulating metabolites clearly had no effect on CYP1A2 in 
human hepatocytes. There were some inducing effects of esketamine on CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro in 
human hepatocytes. 
In vitro, esketamine and its major circulating metabolites had a low inhibition potential against CYPs and 
UGTs. Only noresketamine showed a weak inhibition on CYP3A4 (IC50 = 1.9 μM) with testosterone as 
substrate but not for midazolam and nifedipine as CYP3A4 substrates. 
Esketamine and its pharmacologically active metabolite noresketamine were not a substrate of 
investigated transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 for esketamine, and P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2 for noresketamine). Given the Cmax values of 0.63 µM for esketamine 
in humans after an intranasal dose of 84 mg, and with about 50 % unbound to plasma proteins, the 
concentration of esketamine of 0.3 µM tested in these experiments was in the same range as the 
concentration obtained in human after a therapeutic dose of esketamine. 
Esketamine and none of its major circulating phase-1 metabolites (M10, M9, M4, M5 and M19) were found 
to be a relevant inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K 
transporters. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single and repeated intranasal dosing of esketamine was investigated in rats and dogs, because of 
similarities in metabolic pathways of esketamine to those in humans, former experience with ketamine in 
Assessment report

these animal species and presence of the pharmacologic target in both species. Single dose studies were 
also performed with ketamine as well as single and repeat-dose studies with (es)-ketamine using 
different ways of application. The clinical formulation of esketamine was used in a single dose toxicity 
study in dogs and in the long-term toxicity studies with esketamine in rats and dogs. 
In the single dose studies with (es)-ketamine mainly CNS-related clinical signs were observed which could 
be attributed to the exaggerated pharmacology of esketamine and ketamine. Toxicokinetic parameters 
obtained within the single dose study in dogs showed low oral and relatively high intranasal bioavailability 
of esketamine (approximately 50 %). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
After repeated intranasal dosing of esketamine to rats and dogs, again dose-dependent CNS-related 
clinical signs due to the pharmacologic action of esketamine were observed in all dose groups. The 
3-month studies included high dose recovery groups. Recovery of CNS-signs was shown in both animal 
species. CNS-related clinical signs were also frequently observed during phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials 
with esketamine. 
Common findings in dogs and rats after intranasal application of esketamine were histopathological 
changes in the nasal cavity. There was no evidence of ulceration, basal cell hyperplasia/metaplasia or 
inflammatory response in the nasal cavity. Therefore, nasal changes were considered to represent a local 
response to the repeated intranasal instillation of material, rather than an indication of toxicity. 
Slight increases in heart rate were seen in the 3-month study in dogs in all treated animals; increases 
were not reversible in females. Increases in heart rate were also observed in safety pharmacology 
studies. Changes in cardiovascular parameters, like increases in heart rate, are known effects of 
(es)-ketamine in humans. 
In summary, main findings after repeated intranasal application of esketamine to rats and dogs are 
pharmacology related clinical signs of the CNS and histopathological changes attributed to mild irritation 
provoked by repeated intranasal application. Exposures at the NOAEL of the intranasal studies were in 
general around human therapeutic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (based on 
AUC). Clinical signs and changes in the nasal cavity were observed below human exposures. 
A 2-week study with oral application of esketamine to rats showed hepatotoxicity in male rats at 
exposures corresponding to human therapeutic exposures based on AUC. Hepatotoxicity was observed 
with ketamine treatment in clinical use. However, hepatotoxicity of esketamine was only observed in 
male rats from the high dose group and not associated with increased liver enzymes or changes in 
bilirubin. Kidney toxicity was also observed in all treated males and was discussed to be due to 
α2µ-globulin nephropathy which is a male rat specific finding. Esketamine exposures at the NOAEL for 
female rats after oral application were about 5-times based on AUC at the MRHD. 
Several repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed with ketamine by Javelin Pharmaceuticals. 
Detailed study reports were not available for these studies; therefore, they are only considered as 
supportive for the assessment of esketamine. Taken together, CNS-related clinical signs, changes 
indicative of nasal irritation at large dose volumes, and bladder changes were observed in all species 
treated with ketamine. Beside bladder changes, these findings are fully in line with observations from 
repeat-dose toxicity studies with esketamine. After intranasal esketamine exposure changes in the 
urinary bladder were only observed in the 3-month dog study in one animal each of the mid and high dose 
group. Since findings had dissimilar histopathological characteristics, were not dose-related and were not 
observed after recovery, they were not considered treatment-related. However, literature reports 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
 
 
suggest that chronic ketamine abuse may be associated with ulcerative cystitis. The urinary tract 
symptoms observed with esketamine in clinical trials in general appeared to be reversible and did not 
suggest a risk of permanent bladder damage. Otherwise, the toxicity studies indicate no differences in the 
toxicities of ketamine and esketamine. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Ketamine was negative in a GLP-conform Ames test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice performed 
by Javelin but was found to be mutagenic in a GLP-conform in vitro micronucleus test after metabolic 
activation performed by the same company. Subsequent in vivo testing of ketamine by Javelin in a 
micronucleus test performed in mice after IP dosing yielded negative results. To follow up the positive in 
vitro results JRD performed an in vitro micronucleus test with esketamine in TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, 
which again gave a positive result after metabolic activation. In accordance with ICH S2(R1) a second in 
vivo assay was conducted covering a different endpoint (Comet assay in rat liver). Esketamine was not 
genotoxic in the Comet assay following IV infusion of esketamine up to 50 mg/kg/day on three 
consecutive days with a mean concentration based safety margin of approximately 39 for esketamine and 
22 for noresketamine to the MRHD at 84 mg/day. Overall, esketamine can be considered as 
non-genotoxic in vivo. The reason for the positive in vitro findings was not further evaluated by the 
Applicant but was assumed to be mediated by radical intermediates formed during metabolism in the 
absence of GSH in in vitro tests (see section pharmacokinetics for details). Based on the negative results 
of the in vivo genotoxicity tests and the negative carcinogenicity studies, it is considered acceptable not 
to further follow up these positive findings. 
Esketamine was not carcinogenic after nasal instillation up to the maximum feasible dose in a long-term 
carcinogenicity study in rats. Safety margins to the MRHD of 84 mg for esketamine and noresketamine 
were low. The Cmax- and AUC-based exposure ratios were approximately 1.2- and 0.5-fold, respectively, 
for esketamine, and 1.6- and 0.5-fold, respectively, for noresketamine (M10). It is agreed, that higher 
nasal dosing of rats is not feasible. In a subsequent SC 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic 
Tg.rasH2 mice no increase in tumour incidences was observed. Safety margins to the MRHD of 84 mg for 
esketamine and noresketamine were higher than in the rat carcinogenicity study. At 40 mg/kg/day, the 
Cmax- and AUC-based safety margins for esketamine compared to the 84 mg MRHD were approximately 
20- and 4-fold, respectively. For noresketamine (M10), these margins were approximately 16- and 
4-fold, respectively. Based on the negative in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies, esketamine is 
not considered to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In a rat fertility study with intranasal administered esketamine (up to 9 mg/day), no adverse effects on 
fertility and reproductive capacity and performance were found. Rat and rabbit embryo-foetal 
developmental toxicity studies were conducted with intranasal administered ketamine up to 150 and 50 
mg/kg/day, respectively. In the rat, 15 mg/kg/day was considered the NOEL for maternal toxicity, and a 
dose of 150 mg/kg/day was considered the NOEL for developmental toxicity. In the rabbit, the highest 
dose level of 100 mg/kg/day was reduced to 50 mg/kg/day due to mortality. The dose of 10 mg/kg/day 
was considered the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity in rabbits, solely driven by a decrease 
in foetal body weight at the mid dose in the presence of maternal toxicity (i.e., decreases in maternal food 
consumption and corrected maternal body weight gain). No statistically significant differences in external, 
visceral and skeletal malformations or variations were seen in foetuses. IV bridging TK studies 
demonstrated that esketamine comprised approximately 49 and 30% of the systemic exposures in 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 28/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ketamine-treated pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Taken together, intranasal ketamine did not 
lead to reproductive toxicity.  
In pre- and postnatal development in the Crl:CD(SD) rat with esketamine mainly CNS-related clinical 
signs were observed which could be attributed to the exaggerated pharmacology of esketamine. The 
NOAEL for the pre- and postnatal survival, growth, maturation, neurobehavioral development and 
reproductive performance of the F0 offspring was considered to be 9 mg/rat/day. In the F1 offspring at 9 
mg/rat/day a dose dependent delay in Preyer response reflex was detected. However, histological 
evaluations showed that the brain, including the neuroanatomical structures responsible for the auditory 
pathway, was not affected.  
NMDAR antagonists, including ketamine, are well known to induce apoptotic neurodegeneration in the 
developing neonatal rodent brain. Published data indicate that parenterally administered ketamine exerts 
developmental neurotoxicity in pregnant rats and monkeys, since it induces neuronal cell death in the 
brain of the offspring. Ketamine-induced neuronal cell death was also observed with early postnatal IP or 
SC treatment of rat and mice pups, a period of rapid brain growth. This period of brain development 
translates into the third trimester of human pregnancy. A similar risk of developmental neurotoxicity 
cannot be excluded for esketamine. It should be considered that Spravato is designated for long-term 
medication. Therefore, the use of esketamine during pregnancy is not recommended. Milk transfer of 
esketamine was not investigated. Animal milk transfer has been reported for racemic ketamine. For 
safety reasons it is advised not to take Spravato while breast-feeding or to discontinue breast-feeding. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Fast absorption occurred after intranasal administration of esketamine across species. Higher 
noresketamine (M10) than esketamine exposures were observed after repeated intranasal dosing in rats 
of both sexes whereas AUC values were higher for esketamine and noresketamine (M10) in females than 
in males. In dogs, esketamine exposures were generally higher than noresketamine (M10) exposures in 
both sexes and no important sex-related differences in exposures were observed. In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies with esketamine, noresketamine (M10) was only adequately covered in the rat. 
Exposure levels to metabolites M4 and M19 were compared for the long-term toxicity studies with 
esketamine in rats and dogs to human exposures at the MRHD. Exposure to M4 in rats exceeded human 
exposures whereas exposures to M4 in dogs were below human exposures based on AUC. Exposures to 
M19 were lower to significantly lower, in both species compared to humans. However, based on group 
mean AUC, the 10% threshold of exposure to drug and metabolites was only exceeded for 
noresketamine. All other metabolites represented less than 10% of the total drug related material. 
Interspecies differences in local exposure to the nasal cavity were calculated. In long-term studies, rats 
received approximately the same dose volume per nasal cavity surface area as humans at the MRHD, 
while dogs received approximately half of it. 
Local Tolerance  
No specific studies were performed to investigate the local tolerance of intranasal application of 
esketamine. Local tolerance was evaluated within the intranasal repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs. 
Other toxicity studies 
Neurotoxicity studies 
Assessment report

The neurotoxic potential of intranasal administered esketamine was investigated by detailed 
histopathological examination of the brain in a series of dedicated single dose and 14-day repeat-dose 
neurotoxicity studies in adult rats. The NMDAR antagonist [+]MK-801-maleate (dizocilpine) was used as 
the positive control in these studies. No histopathological brain lesions were noted even upon high 
exposures. Furthermore, in the 6- month rat and 9-month dog repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
intranasal administered esketamine, no evidence of neurotoxicity was found as judged by examinations 
of brain histopathology, and neurobehavioral endpoints in the rat and neurological assessments in the 
dog, respectively. The pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study with intranasal esketamine in rats 
did not reveal neurotoxicity findings either.  
Twice weekly SC administration of esketamine hydrochloride up to 150 mg /kg over a period of 14 days 
in juvenile rats led to prominent but transient clinical observations, but did not produce any evidence of 
neuropathological lesions after histopathological examination of the brains. In 6-month repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rats and 9-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs no neurological toxicity in juvenile 
animals was observed. However, Spravato is at present only indicated for adult patients. 
In single dose neurotoxicity studies conducted with SC-dosed ketamine in adult rats, transient neuronal 
vacuolation was observed in female rats at the highest dose tested (60 mg/kg); there were no signs of 
neuronal necrosis. However, there was no evidence of vacuolation at 24 and 72 h post-dose nor was 
neuronal degeneration observed at any time point in this group. Also there was no apparent impact on 
motor skills or learning/memory functions. 
Published data indicate that ketamine also exerts neurotoxicity in juvenile rats and monkeys inducing 
neuronal cell death in the brain. 
Dependence 
A human abuse potential study was conducted, in which intranasal esketamine was compared with an IV 
infusion of ketamine. This human study supersedes an animal study. 
Ketamine is scheduled because of its well-established abuse potential. Given the pharmacological 
analogy, a similar risk is anticipated for esketamine. 
Impurities 
The synthesis impurity T003641 is considered to be safe up to the qualification threshold of NMT 0.2% 
and was negative in an Ames assays and studies on skin erosion and skin irritation and a local lymphnode 
assay. 
Starting material T003642 concentration dependently increased reverse mutations in the E coli strain 
WP2uvrA in the absence and presence of S9 mix in an Ames assay and is thus considered to be 
mutagenic. T003642 is controlled according to ICH M7(R1) as described in the Quality AR. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is not expected to pose a risk to the surface water, groundwater as all risk quotients 
are below 1. An assessment of the risk to the terrestrial compartment is considered not necessary. 
Esketamine hydrochloride is not a potential PBT substance. However, the active substance has to be 
classified as very persistent in sediments due to the half-life (DT50) of 738.4 days (normalised to 12 °C, 
the average outdoor temperature in the EU). A risk to sediment organisms is not expected.

a  Dosing: 
•  Magnitude: 
Start vs end, induction phases: In all studies, all esketamine treatment groups, and all age groups, the starting dose was lower than or 
equivalent to the ending dose. For example, in studies of 56 or 84 mg, all subjects started with 56 mg. Because early titration is more 
relevant to tolerability than to efficacy, the early titration schedules are not detailed here. 
Age-specific and country-specific options: In Study TRD3004, the 28-mg dose was applicable only to subjects aged ≥65 years and to 
subjects in Korea. 
•  Frequency, optimization and maintenance phases: the frequency of intranasal dosing was individualized (based on a MADRS-driven 
algorithm) to once weekly or every other week to achieve the lowest dosing frequency for an individual subject that could sustain initial 
improvements in depressive symptomatology. The treatment algorithms are described in the Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) and in Appendix 2 of 
this SCE.

Sources: The CSRs, protocols (which are in Appendix 1 of each CSR), and statistical analysis plans (which are in Appendix 9 of each CSR) for each 
study (Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3002, Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3001, Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3005, Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3003, and Mod5.3.5.2/TRD3004). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of esketamine were investigated in 19 PK studies. One study was conducted in 
healthy Japanese subjects (TRD1002) and one in healthy Japanese, Chinese and Korean subjects 
(TRD1008). Subjects with a history of allergic rhinitis were enrolled to evaluate the effects of this 
condition and common comedication on the PK and tolerability of nasal esketamine (TRD1007). In 
addition, the PK of esketamine was evaluated in subjects with mild or moderate liver impairment 
(TRD1011), mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (TRD1014) and in elderly subjects (TRD1003, 
TRD1012, TRRD1018). To evaluate the interaction potential of esketamine four drug-drug interaction 
studies were conducted (TRD1010, TRD1008, TRD1020, TRD1009). 
Methods 
Non-chiral LC-MS/MS assays for the quantification of esketamine and noresketamine in human heparin 
plasma and urine were validated and used. In general, selected method and validation are acceptable.   
Rich and sparse plasma concentration data of esketamine and noresketamine obtained form 13 clinical 
studies (Phases 1, 2 and 3) were pooled for population PK analysis. in order to characterise the PK of 
esketamine and its major metabolite noresketamine after intranasal (IN), IV or PO administration of 
single and multiple doses of esketamine to healthy volunteers and TRD patients. It is questionable if the 
low proportion of the data collected after PO and IV administration compared to the sample size after 
nasal administration allows an adequate estimation of the PK for all three routes of administration.  
Absorption  
The intended route of application for esketamine is to be intranasally via a disposable spray device 
containing 200 µl aqueous solution of esketamine HCl at an esketamine base equivalent concentration of 
140 mg/mL. Esketamine is rapidly absorbed when administered into the nasal cavity as evidenced by the 
presence of the drug in plasma at the first sampling time of 7 minutes, following a 28-mg dose (TRD1001, 
TRD1002, TRD1003, TRD1011, and TRD1014). Nevertheless, application with a nasal device is a new 
application route whose impacts need to be assessed thoroughly. Physiologically based based 
Pharmacokinetics modelling (PBPK) data indicate, that 54% of intranasally administered esketamine is 
absorbed through the nasal cavity and 46% is swallowed with increasing fraction of swallowed

esketamine for every subsequent spray device. In phase I study TRD1009 esketamine’s bioavailability 
was estimated to be 48% for intranasal application (84 mg esketamine) and 14 % for oral application. The 
expected absolute bioavailability, based on pharmacokinetic modelling, is slightly higher for the 28 mg 
and 56 mg doses of intranasal esketamine relative to the 84 mg dose.  For every 28 mg dose step one 
spray in each nostril needs to be applied. Pharmacokinetic studies performed used different dosing 
regimens ranging from 28 mg to 112 mg intranasal esketamine, whereby 56 mg and 84 mg is intended 
to be the recommended starting dose for patients with TRD below the age of 65. In study TRD1001 the 
effects of different handling instructions have been investigated (pause time between each device 5 and 
10 minutes, application angle, sniffing). Although PK data with altered instructions were in parts notably 
higher compared to administration without application instructions no statistical analysis of comparison 
was conducted. In addition, the effects of handling failures like application of two sprays in one nostril or 
sneezing as identified in human factors validation study DS-TEC-127301 on esketamine exposure were 
discussed in detail. Appropriate reflection of these data is presented in the SmPC and PL.  Presented 
bioequivalence studies for formulation changes used inadequate cohorts and were not available with 
comparable cohorts using administration pauses of 5 minutes as proposed in the current SmPC version. 
However, the majority of esketamine pharmacokinetic data were generated with devices that contained 
Formulation G005, which is the one used in the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  
Food  effect  was  not  evaluated.  During  phase  2  and  phase  3  studies,  esketamine  nasal  spray  was 
administered  under  fasting  conditions,  therefore  SmPC  contains  the  same  recommendation  for  the 
method  of  administration,  which  is  agreed.  The  Applicant  clarified  that  the  rationale  for  the  food 
restriction  was  to  minimize  the  potential 
for  adverse  sequelae,  given  the  potential 
for 
treatment-emergent nausea and vomiting observed on dosing days.  
Distribution 
Esketamine’s plasma and tissue distribution have been investigated in non-clinical and clinical studies. In 
humans, distribution of intravenous administered esketamine was measured in study TRD1009 after a 
40-min intravenous infusion of 28 mg esketamine. Mean distribution volume at steady state was 709 L. 
The rapid systemic clearance and large distribution volume observed are consistent with results on 
racemic ketamine and esketamine published previously. In non-clinical studies drug concentration in CNS 
was measured in rats only and showed that the brain to plasma ratio for esketamine was 1.8 at the first 
measurement time point of 1 hour postdose and 0.3 to 0.4 for noresketamine. This is in accordance with 
published data (Hartvig P et al. 1995). The blood to plasma ratio was measured in a radiolabelled mass 
balance study (TRD1016) and were similar for oral or intravenous application ranging from 0.738 to 
0.937. Dialysis analysis shows, that esketamine has a rather low protein binding (55 to 57% unbound) 
which is not altered by renal or hepatic impairment (TRD1011 and TRD1014). Non clinical data indicate, 
that esketamine is not a subject of common transporters. 
Elimination 
In study TRD1009 maximum plasma concentrations of esketamine were observed at a median of 0.67 
hours after 40 minute intravenous esketamine (28 mg), oral (84 mg) and nasal (84 mg). Decrease of 
plasma levels after each treatment showed half-lives of 10.7, 7.8 and 12 hrs for intravenous, oral and 
nasal treatment, respectively. The mean clearance of esketamine administered by the intravenous route 
in healthy subjects was approximately 89 L/h.

Results from in vitro data show that esketamine is extensively metabolized in humans through phase I 
and subsequent phase II reactions. In all species, the most important primary metabolic pathway was 
N-demethylation at the secondary amine to noresketamine and to a smaller extent keto-reduction, 
hydroxylation, oxidation and glucuronidation to metabolites M19, 4, 17, 9, 13, 8, 15, 20 and 18 in 
decreasing order. CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the primary CYP enzymes responsible for the clearance of 
esketamine. The metabolite profiles were similar in plasma following either route of administration 
(intravenous, oral, intranasal). In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, esketamine to 
noresketamine ratio was lower compared to healthy subject. Esketamine is not a substrate of common 
transporters. 
According to results from mass-balance study TRD1016 esketamine and noresketamine reach the same 
Cmax of approximately 0.6 μM at 40 minutes and at 2 hours, respectively, following a single intranasal 
dose of 84 mg esketamine (given over a period of 20 minutes). Median tmax in plasma was 0.75 hours 
after dosing for esketamine and noresketamine, with comparable ranges of individual values. 
According to published data no in vivo back-conversion of esketamine occurs.  
• 
Excretion 
Mass balance study TRD1016 shows that an average of 86.3% and 78.4% of the administered total 
radioactivity was recovered in urine and 1.70% and 1.81% was recovered in feces of the oral and IV 
radiolabelled doses, respectively, which is in accordance with published data. Esketamine is metabolized 
extensively with a high first-pass effect with under <1% and <2.5% of unchanged esketamine being 
excreted renally in subjects with and without renal or hepatic impairment, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
According to a cross-study analysis including PK data from healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects 
(Mod5.3.5.3/SAPDDPS, Mod5.3.5.3/SAPDPS Output) dose-proportionality for the 28 mg, 56 mg and 84 
mg dose could not be shown, it increases in a less than dose-proportional manner. Nevertheless 
dose-proportionality could be shown with pairwise-comparison for the 56 mg and 84 mg dose only. Since 
the 28 mg dose is the recommended starting dose for elderly patients, the Applicant was asked to further 
discuss the implications of non-dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for the proposed dose adjustments in 
elderly patients. Discussion showed, that proposed dose adjustments are appropriate.  
In line with its rather short half-life of 7 to 12 hrs PK data after 25 days of twice weekly esketamine 
treatment showed time-independent PK in healthy subjects and patients with TRD (TRD1010). 
Inter and Intra-individual variability 
According to a cross-study analysis including PK data from healthy Caucasian subjects from phase I 
studies Cmax values are ranging from 27.3 to 66.4 % and it is not surprising that it increases with the 
amount of spray devices used. Values for AUClast are ranging from 18.3 to 44.6%. For this parameter an 
increase in variability is only seen from the 28 mg dose to the the 56 mg dose. Variability of the 56 mg 
dose is comparable to the 84 mg dose. 
No studies for intra-individual variability were presented.  
Inter-individual variabilities found in the population analyses were low to high (23.2%CV for Qh and 
132% for kapo). Different covariates were found to explain the interindividual variability: Dose on FRn, 
Japanese race on FRn, age on Qh, Asian race on kel and Asian race on CLn/F. Some additional parameters 
seem to influence PK of esketamine or noresketamine as parameters of hepatic and renal impairment.

Since the covariate analyses are considered to have some deficiencies, the impact of renal and hepatic 
impairment cannot be finally evaluated. The following points need to be clarified: 
The criteria for inclusion of covariates are not fully agreed. Therefore, the covariate analyses cannot be 
fully supported. According to the forest plots comparing AUC ratios for subpopulations, it seems that not 
all relevant covariates have been found by the conducted covariate analyses. Values of parameters 
reflecting liver- and renal function seem to additionally influence PK of esketamine. The covariate 
analyses should be re-evaluated accordingly. Potentially, the influence of age on the PK were 
disentangled by the influence of renal and hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments for patients with renal 
/ hepatic impairment taking into consideration the results of the population PK analysis have been 
submitted and appropriate guidance regarding hepatic and renal impairments in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
has been proposed (please see below Population pharmacokinetics). 
A justification is also required, for the conclusion that dose adjustments based on the identified covariates 
(Japanese on FRn, Asian on kel and CLn/F) are not warranted. This should be discussed also in the light 
that based on the deterministic model-based simulations Asian (non-Japanese and Japanese) are 
expected to have an up to 48 % higher noresketamine AUC, and in addition, Japanese are expected to 
have higher esketamine AUC and Cmax values (up to 38 %). This is reflected appropriately in the SmPC.   
With respect to the covariate “age”: Exposure metrics could only be found for 18 or 70 year old simulated 
subjects (Table 8) and thus results comparing 70 year old Caucasians and Asians to those below 60 years 
of age cannot be followed but were described.  In addition, 70-year-old Japanese were not compared to 
other subpopulations.  Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, hepatic blood flow (Qh) 
decreased at a rate of 21.9 L/h×10 years in subjects ≥60 years of age. To illustrate this relationship, Qh 
is expected to be 25% lower in subjects from 77 years onwards than in adult subjects younger than 60 
years old. Furthermore, individual estimates of parameters of the final pharmacokinetic model indicated 
the geometric mean esketamine AUC ratio (90% confidence interval) for subjects >60 years of age versus 
those 40 to 60 years of age did not deviate greatly from unity (1.05 [0.99, 1.11]). 
PK parameters in target population/patients with TRD 
No obvious changes in PK parameters were detected comparing phase II and III studies in patients with 
TRD with phase I studies in healthy subjects. According to the presented mechanism of action and 
pharmacokinetic profile of esketamine, no changes in PK parameters were expected. 
The pharmacokinetics for esketamine and noresketamine were best described with a combined 
three-compartment and two-compartment model, respectively. After nasal administration absorption 
followed a first-order rate while oral absorption was described by a sequential zero- and first-order 
absorption. A hepatic compartment resembles the hepato-portal system. Furthermore, the model 
assumed that esketamine in the hepatic compartment is metabolised either to noresketamine or to other 
metabolites through a linear process. The biotransformation of esketamine to noresketamine was 
characterised by a first-order rate constant while the elimination of esketamine through other metabolic 
routes was characterized by a first-order rate constant. The presented population PK model seems to 
describe the data adequately with good precision, although VPCs reveal some small remaining over- or 
under-prediction in particular in the elimination phase, but which may be tolerated.  
Generally, all parameter estimates of the base and the final population PK model should be presented 
including information on shrinkage. It should be kept in mind that visual inspection of covariate relations 
is only valid with low shrinkages.  
The model revealed, that hepatic flow (Qh) changes with age. An explanation , why noresketamine 
plasma concentrations are not decreased with decreasing Qh was provided

Special populations 
Elderly 
Esketamine shows a significant increase in Cmax and AUC for elderly patients >65 years (21% and 18%) 
compared to younger adults despite other covariates as race, and target population. The mean 
esketamine Cmax and AUC∞ values produced by an 84-mg dose were 67% and 38% higher in elderly 
subjects (age range 75 to 85 years) compared with younger adult subjects. Dose reduction 
recommendations were proposed for elderly patients with starting doses of 28 mg intranasal esketamine. 
No specific studies have been performed for elderly subjects above 85 years of age. 
Population PK analyses revealed the following covariates included in the final model: dose on FRn, 
Japanese on FRn, Age on Qh, Asians on kel and Asians on CLn/F. Parameters of renal and hepatic 
impairment were not included as covariates until now but seem to have an additional effect on the PK of 
esketamine and noresketamine, which should be clarified (see above).

Gender  
No clinically relevant differences in esketamine exposure could be observed for renal impairment, weight 
and gender. 
Hepatic impairment 
In study TRD1011 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment showed mean AUC∞ values of 213.7% of 
according AUC∞ in healthy subjects. In addition, mean Cmax values are 44% lower and t1/2 significantly 
longer for its main metabolite noresketamine. A detailed discussion on the lack of dose recommendation 
for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and a warning under section 4.4 of the SmPC like 
in many European Products for intravenous ketamine is necessary (German Ketanest S, UK Ketamine 50 
mg/ml for injection PL 01502/ 0099 or SE Ketamin Abcur) . Plasma protein binding of esketamine was 
independent from hepatic function and the fraction unbound ranged between 56% and 61% in subjects 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and 57% in healthy subjects. 
Ethnicity 
Although pharmacokinetic parameters are elevated for Han-Chinese, Korean and especially Japanese 
subjects (Cmax 41%, AUC∞ 40% after 56 mg intranasal esketamine in Japanese; TRD1008) no dose 
recommendations were proposed, because values are within the inter-subject variability. Although this is 
true, conclusion is hampered because the referenced inter-individual variability was calculated from a 
pooled analysis of healthy Caucasian subjects. Elevated esketamine exposure for the Asian and Japanese 
subjects could be on top of inter-individual variability possibly increasing the individual esketamine 
exposure especially for Japanese subjects above tolerated concentrations. Appropriate wording for 
patients of Japanese ancestry has been introduced in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 40/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the safety data, it seems that Japanese subjects experienced more adverse events than 
Caucasian subjects (total adverse events reported: 80% vs. 50%). Moreover, reporting of adverse events 
in Japanese subjects appears to be dose dependent (35.7% [28mg], 50.0% [56mg], 69.2% [84mg), 
though this isn’t reflected in any particular adverse events. This is in contrast to what has been  observed 
in Caucasian subjects (15.4% [28mg], 35.7% [56mg] and 23.1% [84mg]). It also seems that the 
reporting of adverse events in Japanese subjects are more specific to esketamine (headache, vertigo, 
vomiting and nausea) whereas in the Caucasian population it is more sporadic.  
CYP2B6 Polymorphism 
The Applicant graphically showed in its comprehensive cross-study pharmacokinetic analysis 
(Mod5.3.3.3/54135419CD170056) on CYP2B6 polymorphism extensive overlap in the range of plasma 
Cmax and AUClast values of esketamine following administration as a nasal spray in subjects classified as 
extensive, intermediate, or poor Metabolizers of CYP2B6 substrates. The Applicant evaluated 
pharmacokinetics of esketamine graphically, separately in young adult and elderly, and in Japanese 
elderly at each dose level and concluded that CYP2B6 genotype does not have an impact of intranasally 
administered esketamine. Overall, based on the presented scatterplots, there was an overlap in PK 
parameter values for esketamine between CYP2B6 genotypes.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Esketamine’s interaction potential has been studied intensively in vitro. There were no indications for 
transporter interactions and only low inhibition/induction potential for most CYP’s and none for UGTS. 
Only noresketamine showed a weak inhibition potential for CYP3A4 with an IC50 of 1.92 μM for 
testosterone, whereas the IC50 was >30 μM for midazolam and nifedipine. Esketamine showed a minor 
induction potential for CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 with positive induction criteria (% of positive control, and fold 
change versus the negative control) reached at the highest concentration tested only (10 μM). In vivo 
studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical relevance of these effects. 
In vitro, esketamine was found to be mainly metabolized by CYP2B6 (60%) and by CYP3A4 (35 to 40%), 
therefore drug-drug interactions were performed towards those enzymes.  
In vivo study TRD1010 on the induction and inhibition potential of esketamine did not show significant 
increases or decreases in CYP3A4 (midazolam) and CYP2B6 (bupropion) substrates. On the other side, 
studies TRD1009 and TRD1020 showed that esketamine’s exposure was altered in the range of 5% to 
29%  (mean  values  for  AUC ∞ ),  respectively  by  comedication  of  common  CYP3A4  (TRD1009, 
clarithromycin)  and  CYP2B6  (TRD1020,  ticlopidine)  inhibitors.  Study  TRD1008  showed,  that  mean 
esketamine AUC∞ values were decreased by 28% by comedication of a common CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 
inducer  (rifampicin).  The  corresponding  90%  confidence  intervals  were  clearly  below  or  above  the 
common  range  of  80-125  %  for  bioequivalence.  In  addition,  this  effect  may  be  underestimated  as 
rifampicin was stopped (Day -1) before administration of esketamine on Day 1 in Period 2. Although these 
effects are significant, clinical relevance cannot be estimated at this point. Proposed informative sections 
in  5.2  are  therefore  supported,  and  were  expanded  to  include  changes  in  esketamine  exposure  from 
ticlopidine comedication.  
The effect of comedication has been studied for intranasal corticosteroids in healthy subjects and 
decongestants in subjects with allergic rhinitis. In study TRD1007 subjects with allergic rhinitis did not 
show clinically relevant differences in esketamine exposure when compared to healthy subjects. When a 
decongestant (oxymetazoline HCl) or corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) was administered 1 hr prior to 
the treatment, as commonly used in this population, esketamine exposure was similar. According to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 41/42 
 
 
 
 
 
trial setup SmPC recommendations to use intranasal decongestants or corticosteroids at least 1 hr prior 
to the esketamine administration were proposed. 
After, a more detailed discussion on possible effects of sneezing and the mucosity of nasal discharge e.g. 
during common colds on esketamine exposure, inclusion of appropriate sections in SmpC and PL have 
been introduced.  
No dedicated studies have been presented to evaluate the effect of antidepressant drugs as 
co-medication on esketamine exposure. Retrospectively presented individual esketamine PK parameters 
under co-administration with the allowed antidepressant drugs used (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline 
and venlafaxine) were compared to healthy subject data and otherwise justified. Any significant influence 
on esketamine PK was sufficiently excluded.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Esketamine (the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine) is a known active substance, approved (in some 
European Union [EU] countries) and used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia via 
intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) infusion. Its growing off-label use as antidepressant, 
predominantly in the USA, was one reason to establish a clinical trial program to assess esketamine’s 
efficacy and safety. 
Mechanism of action 
The in vitro binding potential of esketamine, arketamine and ketamine was investigated against a panel 
of receptors, ion channels and transporters showing, that ketamine and esketamine are non-competitive, 
subtype  non-selective,  activity  dependent  NMDAR  antagonists.  For  a  more  detailed  review  on  the 
mechanism of action and in vitro data please refer to the nonclinical Assessment Report. Evidence within 
the literature (Duman RS et al. 2016 and Murrough JW et al. 2017) suggests that, transient increase in 
glutamate release leads to increases in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 
(AMPAR)  stimulation,  which  in  turn  increases  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF)  expression, 
synthesis and release, activations of neurotrophic signaling pathway and activation of synaptic plasticity 
genes such as activity-regulated cytoskeleton (ARC)-associated protein. These changes are thought to 
further induce production of synaptic proteins and synaptogenesis, and eventually restoration of synaptic 
function. However, there are data available suggesting that these changes in synapses are temporary and 
are lost after a short period of time. In conjunction to this, the proposed dosing recommendation with 
dosing frequency twice a week – once in two weeks has not been adequately justified. Altogether it has 
not been fully elucidated what are the structural changes in CNS that produce antidepressant effects, 
lasting for longer periods of time. Furthermore, the (long-term) impact of these changes on for example 
cognition and suicidality remain unknown. The Applicant provided a discussion on the claimed effect of 
esketamine  on  synaptogenesis  and  restoration  of  synaptic  function  and  their  persistence  and  also 
touched upon potential differences in elderly in comparison to younger adults.   
Additional effects mediated by modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission cannot be excluded. In 
this respect it is noteworthy that acute and prolonged increases in dopamine levels in prefrontal cortex, 
striatum  and  nucleus  accumbens  occur  immediately  after  administration  of  subanaesthetic  doses  of 
esketamine. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
It  is  unclear  whether  the  increased  exposure  of  esketamine  in  Japanese  subjects  leads  to  any  safety 
issues, given contradictory results from the phase 1 studies. The Applicant is requested to provide an 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 42/43 
 
 
 
 
interim analysis of phase 2b study TRD2005 (if available) to allow for evaluation of the safety profile in 
Japanese subjects. 
The  Applicant  has  not  discussed  the  possible  genetic  differences  in  PD  response,  and  there  are  data 
suggesting that in patients with BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine 
may be lower. The Applicant performed an analysis of the effect of Val66Met polymorphism on MADRS 
response,  based  on  data  from  studies  TRD3001  and  TRD3002.  The  Applicant  provided  very  little 
information on this analysis and results are only presented for study TRD3002. The results suggest that 
response to esketamine is similar irrespective of Val66Met phenotype, however the numbers are low, in 
particular the met/met phenotype. The applicant has provided some more information on the analysis 
performed and the results for study TRD3001. Altogether the results indicate that in contrast to animal 
data, clinical response in humans is not dependent on Val66Met polymorphism, based on data from >300 
patients. 
For a more detailed assessment on PD interactions, please refer to the Safety Assessment in section on 
the Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions. 
Primary pharmacology 
Because  direct  measurement  of  NMDAR  inhibition  in  humans  is  hardly  applicable,  no  primary 
pharmacodynamic  in  vivo  studies  have  been  performed  in  humans.  To  estimate  the  indirect  primary 
pharmacodynamic effect changes in the placebo corrected MADRS score from baseline were used in phase 
II  studies  TRD2001,  TRD2002  and  SUI2001.  For  a  more  detailed  review  please  refer  to  the  Efficacy 
Assessment  in  section  3.3.5.  Although  the  results  of  the  study  suggest  than  an  add-on  IV  ketamine 
treatment  can  reduce  the severity  of  depressive  symptoms  in  average  from  moderate/severe  to  mild   
intensity, data on the long-term effect had not been provided in phase II studies. 
In addition study TRD1001 evaluated the proportion of antidepressant activity of esketamine’s 
metabolites after nasal application. Since noresketamine is the only metabolite with clinically relevant 
binding potential for NMDAR it was the only one to be investigated further. Taking the dissociative 
constant (Ki), circulating concentrations and the brain distribution properties of the 2 compounds into 
consideration noresketamine’s antidepressant activity is estimated to be 11- to 30-times lower at Cmax 
than that of esketamine at Cmax. In view of the not yet completely elucidated mechanism of action, it 
must be emphasized that this is to be regarded only as hypothetical contributions. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In the light of known secondary pharmacology effects of racemic ketamine, five pharmacodynamic 
studies have been conducted with esketamine. 
Thorough QT/QTc study 
The effect of esketamine on the QT interval was evaluated in study TRD1013 in 60 healthy subjects with 
84 mg intranasal esketamine, 0,8 mg/kg intravenous esketamine and 400 mg Moxifloxacin as positive 
control. The design of the QT study follows the ICHE14 guideline and is acceptable. In no case the upper 
bound of the 90% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on 
the QTc interval exceeded 10 ms, the study is hence negative and no impact on QT prolongation could be 
found. 
Cognitive Function 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 43/44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study TRD1005 the effect of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on cognitive function was investigated using 
a computerized test battery. Results were significantly higher after esketamine application compared to 
placebo. The mental effort required, was restored to comparable levels in subjects by 2 hours postdose. 
The Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) showed significant differences between esketamine and placebo 
observed at 40 min and 2 hours postdose, returning to comparable levels by 4 hours. The detected 
impairment subsides within a few hours, and repeated esketamine administration did not affect cognitive 
functioning of patients in long-term treatment. In addition, the mean age of subjects included in this 
study was 25.3 years, it is unclear to what extent the results can be extrapolated to elderly. 
On-road Driving 
On-road driving tests were performed according to current scientific knowledge driving a 100-km primary 
highway circuit with the standard deviation from lateral position (SDLP; Verster et al. 2011) as primary 
objective as same-day driving in healthy subjects (TRD1006) and after multiple-doses in subjects with 
major depressive disorders (MDD; TRD1019 Part B) and next day driving after single dose in subjects with 
MDD (TRD1019, Part A).  
In study TRD1006 the effect of 84 mg esketamine was compared to placebo and mirtazapine as a positive 
control. On-road driving test was performed 8 hours post-dose. Although the least square (LS) means 
(SE) of the SDLP were not significantly higher for esketamine compared to placebo (17.10 (0.92) cm and 
17.25 (0.92) cm, respectively) statistically significant more effort was reported for each active treatment 
(ie, esketamine and mirtazapine) compared with placebo. These results have been adequately reflected 
in the SmPC proposing to only actively taking part in road traffic after a restful night of sleep. 
In Study TRD1019 Part A a driving-test after a single 84 mg dose was performed 18 hours post-dose. The 
difference in mean SDLP (LS mean) between esketamine and placebo was -0.22 cm. As the upper limit of 
the two-sided 95% CI of the mean difference between the treatments was 0.70 cm, the difference was 
not statistically significant (p=0.655). Study Part B was still ongoing, presentation of the data is still 
expected. Nevertheless statistical significance of both study parts is still a subject of discussion since 
prespecified population size of 24 subjects have not been met (Part A 23 subjects, Part B 18 subjects). 
Study results were presented after completion and are acceptable. 
Abuse potential 
The primary objective of Study TRD1015 was to evaluate the abuse potential of esketamine nasal spray 
in healthy, nondependent, recreational polydrug users of perception altering drugs. The results of this 
study confirmed the abuse potential of both ketamine and esketamine. For a more detailed discussion and 
raised OC please refer to section 4.3.5 of the Safety Report. 
PK/PD 
Two different and complementary approaches were used to deal with the dose up titration in TRD3002 
study and the dose differences in TRD3001. One approach consisted in a dose-response analysis using 
ΔMADRS as efficacy parameter linked to the dose via a linear model. The other approach was a PKPD 
model using individual (model derived) plasma concentrations linked via an effect compartment to an 
Emax model of the MADRS Total scores. Safety parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 
CADSS) were linearly linked to blood concentrations. A tolerance effect was included for blood pressure 
and CADSS effects over time. With respect to the modelling approach open points were clarified.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of esketamine were investigated in 19 PK studies. The Applicant provided a 
comprehensive dossier presenting adequate information on esketamine’s elimination, distribution and 
metabolism. There were studies presented on the bioavailability and bioequivalence for the intranasal 
application of esketamine via a disposable spray device. Upon request, the applicant provided detailed 
discussion on the effect of application instructions and handling failures exposure to esketamine, together 
with appropriate recommendations in the SmPC.  
Furthermore the applicant sufficiently explained that the cut-off age of 65 years, which is used in the 
posology section of the SmPC is for consistency with the conduct of the Phase 3 studies. The 
recommendation for dose adjustment (ie, a starting dose of 28 mg intranasal esketamine) for subjects 
≥65 years of age were mainly done to improve tolerability in older patients. 
Population Pharmacokinetics: 
To assess the PK/PD relationship a PKPD model using individual (model derived) plasma concentrations 
linked via an effect compartment to an Emax model of the MADRS Total scores was applied. A number of 
questions were raised regarding the population PK and PKPD analysis. In particular, further clarification 
on the covariate analysis was needed. The Applicant provided detailed information on the stepwise 
evaluation of the covariates.  Furthermore, regarding the identified covariates age, renal / hepatic 
impairment and race (i.e. Japanese and non-Japanese Asian) from the presented studies, the Applicant 
was requested to further discuss the need for dose adjustment taking into consideration the results of the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. The Applicant subsequently proposed the following guidance for 
these patients in the SmPC section 4.2 Posology and method of administration as follows: 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild (Child Pugh class A) or moderate (Child Pugh class 
B) hepatic impairment. However, the maximum dose of 84 mg should be used with caution in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Spravato has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Use in this population is not recommended (see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Patients on dialysis 
were not studied. 
Race 
For patients of Japanese ancestry, initial Spravato dose is 28 mg esketamine (day 1, starting dose, see 
Table 3). Subsequent doses should be increased in increments of 28 mg up to 56 mg or 84 mg, based on 
efficacy and tolerability. 
This guidance was further detailed using a Table and included detailed recommendations for the induction 
phase (starting and subsequent doses) and maintenance phase.  
Since Japanese patients are expected to reach higher 14 % and 33 % higher Cmax and AUC∞ levels after 
a single 56 mg dose, compared to non-Japanese patients, the Applicant proposed the following guidance 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC Posology and method of administration, which was agreed:

The above mentioned SmPC modifications were considered appropriate and acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action in terms of receptor binding and subsequent cascade of molecular events has 
been adequately described and discussed. The most important secondary pharmacological effects of 
esketamine have been adequately investigated and reflected in the proposed SmPC.  
The Applicant has provided satisfactory response to all issues raised during the procedure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From the clinical pharmacology point of view, there are no remaining issues and Marketing Authorisation 
can be granted. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The final proposed indication for esketamine is, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, for adults with 
treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder who have not responded to at least two different 
treatments with antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode.  
Esketamine is intended to be self-administered intranasally using a single-use device under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional.  
The proposed dosage recommendations for esketamine nasal spray are shown in the following table. It is 
recommended  to  maintain  the  dosage  the  patient  receives  at  the  end  of  the  induction  phase  in  the 
maintenance phase. Dose adjustments should be made based on efficacy and tolerability to the previous 
dose. 
Induction Phase 
Weeks 1-4 (two treatment sessions/week): 
Maintenance Phase 
Weeks 5-8:  
Starting Day 1 dose:* 56 mg 
Subsequent doses: 56 mg or 84 mg 
56 mg or 84 mg once weekly  
From Week 9:  
56 mg or 84 mg every 2 weeks or once 
weekly** 
Evidence of therapeutic benefit should be 
evaluated at the end of induction phase to 
determine need for continued treatment. 
*  For patients ≥65 years Day 1 starting dose is 28 mg  
** Dosing frequency should be individualized to the lowest frequency to maintain 
remission/response. 
Periodically reexamine the need for continued 
treatment. 
After depressive symptoms improve, treatment is recommended for at least 6 months. 
A recommendation for Post administration Observation is also included in the Posology and Method of 
Administration section of the SmPC: 
During and after Spravato administration at each treatment session, patients should be observed under 
the supervision of a healthcare professional until the patient is stable based on clinical judgment (see 
section 4.4 of the SmPC).  Before Spravato administration, instruct patients not to engage in potentially 
hazardous activities, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery until the next day after a 
restful sleep (see section 4.7 of the SmPC).

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The Applicant’s initial Phase 2 studies in subjects with TRD investigated the efficacy and safety of 2 doses 
of intravenous esketamine (in Study TRD2001) or 2 dosing frequencies of intravenous ketamine (in 
Study TRD2002). 
Initial Phase 1 studies with the nasal spray formulation in healthy subjects demonstrated that: (i) nasally 
administered esketamine was rapidly absorbed; (ii) plasma levels similar to those achieved after 0.2 or 
0.4 mg/kg IV esketamine could be achieved after nasal administration at doses of 28 to 84 mg 
esketamine; and (iii) esketamine nasal spray had good local tolerability. 
The nasal route of administration offers two advantages: a) a fixed dosage unit for multiple administration 
reduces likelihood of error and b) nasal mucosa facilitates rapid and appreciable absorption. 
In Study TRD2003 a broad range of dose regimens (14 to 84 mg esketamine nasal spray) was used. The 
1 week primary efficacy endpoint of the double-blind phase for Panel A demonstrated that treatment with 
the 28-, 56-, and 84 mg doses of esketamine nasal spray, when added to an existing oral AD, significantly 
improved depressive symptoms (per MADRS total score) in subjects with TRD compared with placebo 
(please see also below in Main studies section). After 1 week of treatment (twice a week dosing session), 
a dose-response analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between esketamine dose 
and change in MADRS total score.   
Sixty-seven participants (38 women, mean [SD] age, 44.7 [10.0] years) were included in the efficacy and 
safety analyses. Change (least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score (both 
periods combined) in all 3 esketamine groups was superior to placebo (esketamine 28 mg: -4.2 [2.09], 
1-sided P=.02; 56 mg: -6.3 [2.07], 1-sided P=.001; 84 mg: -9.0 [2.13], 1-sided P<.001), with a 
significant ascending dose-response relationship (1-sided P<.001). Forty-one participants (17 women, 
mean [SD] age, 44.5 [8.03] years) were included in the efficacy and safety analyses of Panel B. In Period 
1, the change (least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score was significant at the 
1-sided 0.10 level for the esketamine 56 mg group (-3.7 [2.81], 1-sided p=0.096) vs placebo, but not for 
the esketamine 14 mg group (+1.8 [2.62], 1-sided p=0.751) vs placebo. In Period 2, the change 
(least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score was greater for the esketamine 14 
mg group (-5.9 [5.58]) vs placebo than for the esketamine 56 mg group (-0.5 [6.25]) vs placebo. 
In addition, after 2 weeks of treatment, the rate of remission (when defined as MADRS total score of ≤12 
points, the same as the definition in the Phase 3 studies) at endpoint was lowest in the adjunctive oral AD 
+ intranasal placebo group (at 10.0%) and ascendingly higher for each dose level in the esketamine + 
oral AD groups (at 12.5%, 27.3%, and 40.0% for esketamine doses of 28, 56, and 84 mg, respectively).  
In Panel B, with only Japanese subjects treated with oral AD + intranasal placebo and 14-, or 56-mg doses 
of esketamine nasal spray + existing oral AD, small improvements in MADRS total score were observed in 
the 14-mg group and dose-response was detected. 
In the Applicant's Study SUI2001 efficacy of esketamine was further supported in a related population of 
patients with major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide (MDSI). The 84 mg dose of 
esketamine nasal spray, when added to optimized antidepressant treatment in inpatient hospitalization, 
demonstrated statistically significant (and clinically meaningful) efficacy on the primary endpoint at 4 
hours postdose and on Day 2 (approximately 24 hours postdose). 
Esketamine will be administered as add-on therapy concomitantly with an oral antidepressant. The 
Applicant has investigated both intravenous and intranasal administration of esketamine and has 
correlated the plasma levels achieved via the two routes. In this dedicated dose response study TRD2003, 
the efficacy parameters (improvement of depressive symptoms using MADRS) provided adequate data 
showing higher improvement with higher doses of intranasal esketamine.   
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019

With depressed patients a flexibility in the dosing schedule is considered common clinical practice, 
depending on the observed efficacy and the undesirable effects. The treating physician after the patient’s 
evaluation is expected to suggest modifications to the treatment and it is not considered uncommon to 
increase the amount of antidepressants or decrease them to the minimum effective dose or even modify 
the dosing frequency in order to achieve the maximum possible effect for the patient with the maximum 
tolerability. 
The available data are considered supportive of a flexible dosing scheme. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Tables and Figures with a letter e.g. A, B, C, etc. have been compiled by the assessment 
teams. Tables and Figures with numbers have been extracted from the Applicant’s 
documentation.  
The clinical program of intranasal esketamine comprises 5 completed Phase 3 studies investigating 
efficacy and safety in adults with TRD (TRD3001 or TRANSFORM-1, TRD3002 or TRANSFORM-2) including 
a relapse prevention  study (TRD3003 or SUSTAIN-1) and a study in patients  65 years and older 
(TRD3005 or TRANSFORM-3). Limited safety data are also included in this application from 2 ongoing 
studies in adults with TRD (TRD3004 or SUSTAIN-2) and ongoing Phase 3 studies in adult subjects with 
MDSI (including 2 double-blind (DB) and psychoactive placebo-controlled clinical studies and 1 open label 
(OL) safety study). It is announced that data from a third ongoing study in TRD [TRD3006] and other 
ongoing studies will be available with the Day 120 responses.  
The completed Phase 2 efficacy studies of adjunctive intranasal and intravenous ketamine and 
esketamine for indications relevant to major depressive disorder, including both treatment-resistant 
depression and imminent risk for suicide and the completed Phase 3 efficacy studies of intranasal 
esketamine in treatment-resistant depression have been summarised in the tabular overview of studies 
above. 
It is of note the studies in MDSI will be submitted at a later stage and are not included in the efficacy 
package for TRD.

A number of studies have been submitted to support the proposed indication for the treatment of TRD 
with the proposed flexible dosing regimen. The clinical development program can be considered as 
comprehensive and conforming to the requirements of the EU adopted Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of depression (EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2, 30 May 2013) 
(please see also below comments on study design).    
It is noted however that all studies were performed in an adjunctive setting plus an oral antidepressant for 
TRD and esketamine has not been used as a single therapeutic agent in TRD. 
Key study design features 
According to the current adopted Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment 
of depression (EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2, 30 May 2013), the minimum requirement for the 
development of a medicinal product for the treatment of major depressive disorder is at least one short 
term randomised double blind study parallel group compared to placebo or active comparator in a 
superiority design and one study investigating the maintenance of effect for at least 6 months. Replication 
of the scientific results is usually also expected with the submission of a second phase 3 randomised, 
parallel group, controlled, double bind, short-term study.  
Choice of control (newly-initiated oral AD + intranasal placebo).  
The use of placebo alone in clinical studies of outpatients with MDD (and by extension, TRD) is ethically 
controversial; however, the need to provide reliable evidence of antidepressant efficacy is essential in 
clinical trials of any new investigational product. From a scientific perspective, showing superiority over 
an active comparator is an acceptable alternative to conventional randomized DB comparisons versus 
placebo to permit adequate evaluation of efficacy in MDD.  
For esketamine, three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled short term studies, including one 
study in the elderly, were submitted. All studies were conducted with esketamine administered 
concomitantly with a newly initiated antidepressant. Since in the EU there is currently no product 
approved for the treatment of TRD that would have been adequate as a comparator, the placebo control 
is adequate. However, according to the Applicant, the design of the Phase 3 short-term studies was 
neither an inactive comparator (i.e., placebo) only design nor a classical ‘add-on’ design.

Initiating a new oral AD in the induction phase of the Phase 3 short-term studies increased the difficulty 
of showing a statistically significant difference between the esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal 
placebo treatment groups as there was likely to be some antidepressant effect of the new oral AD. 
In addition, the following was taken into consideration: 
Electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT) model for TRD. The development of esketamine for use in TRD was 
modelled after the use of ECT in this condition, where ECT plus an AD has been shown to result in better 
antidepressant efficacy compared to ECT alone or AD treatment alone in patients with TRD. 
Facilitating optimization of longer-term antidepressant effect. In contrast to available data about the 
short-term antidepressant effects of esketamine/ketamine, much less was known at the time the clinical 
program for esketamine was being designed about how the antidepressant effect of these compounds are 
sustained over the long term. As esketamine was not intended to be used as monotherapy in TRD, an 
important question to be asked in the Phase 3 program was whether, among subjects with confirmed 
stable remission/stable response to initial esketamine + oral AD therapy, treatment with esketamine 
could be stopped and longer-term maintenance be achieved with the oral AD alone (please see also study 
TRD3003). This was the main reason a new oral AD was initiated in the induction phase of TRD3001, 
TRD3002, and TRD3003, as the use of a newly-initiated oral AD (instead of one to which subjects had 
previously not responded) was thought to provide subjects a greater likelihood of achieving sustained 
improvement following discontinuation of esketamine. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
pharmacotherapy started earlier at the same time as ECT is significantly more effective in maintaining the 
induction of response with a course of ECT. 
Ethical considerations in continuing therapy with a failed drug. Initiating a new AD, instead of continuing 
a failed medication to which a subject had demonstrated no clinically meaningful response after an 
adequate treatment course with an optimized dose, is consistent with international depression clinical 
treatment recommendations to switch to a different agent. 
Recommendation of FDA. In a Type B meeting held with FDA in March 2014 concerning the development 
program for TRD, the Division of Psychiatry Products expressed their opinion that continuing a patient on 
an AD medication that was demonstrated to be ineffective was not sound clinical practice and 
recommended that the Phase 3 study design include esketamine given with a newly-initiated AD. 
Imbalances at baseline in terms of tolerance and treatment duration are reduced. As all study medication 
was newly initiated at the start of the DB phase, the potential for bias in terms of duration of concurrent 
oral AD treatment and tolerance to study medication side effects was reduced. An optional, up to 3-week 
taper period prior to the induction phase was included, if clinically indicated, to avoid any carry-over effect 
of the discontinued (failed) oral AD. 
The specific oral AD administered could be selected from 2 different classes of treatments, a selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram or sertraline) or a serotonin and norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (duloxetine or venlafaxine extended release), that the subject had not: (i) 
previously shown nonresponse to in the current depressive episode and/or (ii) demonstrated intolerance 
to (lifetime). The selection of these 4 oral ADs was based on global availability and the need to provide a 
range of appropriate choices for subjects with TRD that were consistent with the current standard of care; 
these drugs were considered by the Applicant fully representative of the 2 main classes of ADs. 
The argumentation presented by the Applicant for the concomitant administration of a newly initiated oral 
AD is considered valid and acceptable although the initiation of two new therapies at the same time has 
not been considered common practice so far. Furthermore, contemporary treatment guidelines are not 
recommending a depressed patient to remain on a treatment that is not useful for its condition from both 
ethical and clinical practice perspectives. Either add-on or switch therapies are consequently explored. 
During scientific advice procedure when different designs were presented by the Applicant, the initiation 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 50/51 
 
 
 
 
of a new AD at the same time as initiation of esketamine treatment was finally favoured compared to 
continuation of an antidepressant to which no response was shown (Scientific Advice Clarification letter 
EMA/605499/2014).  
However, it was clarified that there were no sufficient efficacy or safety data available for the combination 
of TCAs or MAOIs (these were excluded in the phase 3 studies) and intranasal, esketamine from the phase 
3 studies. As such, extrapolation from SSRIs and SNRIs to all oral ADs was not considered appropriate 
and the indication was restricted accordingly.     
Length of induction phase (duration of phase 3 short term studies)  
The 4-week duration of the induction phase to investigate the antidepressant effect of esketamine is 
considered appropriate and within the recommendations of the EU Depression Guideline.  Furthermore, 
based on an FDA conducted meta-analysis of data from 24 short-term AD trials submitted to this US 
agency over a 10-year period, the AD-placebo treatment difference was consistent for trials of 4 to 8 
weeks’ duration, suggesting that it is plausible to shorten AD trial duration to 4 weeks. 
Maintenance of effect 
According to the same Guideline, for authorisation it should be shown that a short-term effect can be 
maintained during the index episode. For this a randomised withdrawal study, allowing to study relapse 
prevention is probably the best design. The Applicant has included a relapse prevention study in the 
clinical development program for esketamine.  
The Applicant has also included a study in older patients and an open label long term study. It is noted 
that a long term double blind study investigating the prevention of the next episode(s) or recurrence 
prevention is not a mandatory part of a registration package for treatment of MDD episodes.  
It should be noted, however, that the initial proposed indication for this application was considered broad 
and not supported by the clinical program, since esketamine has been used only as an add-on therapy 
administered concomitantly with a newly initiated oral AD and monotherapy data were not available. With 
respect to the role of esketamine as monotherapy in the treatment armamentarium of TRD, the Applicant 
is currently considering various design options and objectives for the monotherapy study.  
The Applicant agreed to modify the proposed indication for SPRAVATO to better describe the patient 
population evaluated in the clinical development program, as follows:  
•  SPRAVATO, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant 
Major Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with 
antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode (see section 5.1). 
Study Participants 
Phase 2 studies 
In Panel A of study TRD2003, 60 subjects were planned to be randomly assigned to treatment to receive 
placebo, 28mg, 56mg or 84 mg intranasal esketamine and 40 subjects in Panel B to receive placebo, 
14mg or 56 mg intranasal esketamine, concomitantly with an antidepressant. 
In study SUI2001, Sixty-eight adult subjects (man or woman), were randomized to intranasal esketamine 
84 mg (n = 36) or intranasal placebo (n = 32), and included in safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analyses, by treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019

Phase 3 studies 
All Phase 3 studies enrolled subjects who had moderate to severe depression and who had not responded 
to 2 or more different oral AD treatments for the current depression episode, the last of which was 
assessed prospectively during the screening/observational phase, except in the case of the long-term 
TRD3004 study, which used retrospective confirmation.  
In all controlled Phase 3 studies, treatment resistance was defined in accordance with the regulatory 
definition, i.e., a lack of clinically meaningful improvement (defined for Phase 3 studies as ≤25%) in the 
current episode of depression after treatment with at least 2 different AD agents prescribed in adequate 
dosages for an adequate duration (defined for Phase 3 studies as at least 6 weeks). 
Short term phase 3 studies. 
Subjects were required to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition 
(DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD or single-episode MDD (duration ≥2 years) without 
psychotic features, which was verified by the structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
(MINI). 
In addition, subjects had to have a MADRS total score of ≥28 for TRD3001 and TRD3002 and ≥24 for 
TRD3005 based on assessment by a remote, independent rater at Weeks 1, 2, and 4 of the 
screening/observational phase with a no more than 25% improvement from Weeks 1 through 4. 
The subjects were 67.1% women and 32.9% men; were white in 83.2% of cases; were enrolled in North 
America for 43.2% of subjects, in Europe for 38.8% of subjects, and in Central or South America for 
18.1% of subjects; and had a mean (SD) age of 46.1 (11.46) years. Population from EU was sufficiently 
represented in the studies (conforming to CHMP Scientific Advice). The Applicant also attempted to fulfil 
the commitment to CHMP to include as many subjects ≥75 years of age as possible to evaluate efficacy in 
an elderly population in the study TRD3005 (please see also section on outcomes).  
Study sites/countries 
The Phase 2 study in TRD (TRD2003) was conducted in Belgium and the US (Panel A) as well as in Japan 
(Panel B), while the Phase 2 study in MDSI (SUI2001) was conducted at US sites. As MDD is a worldwide 
disorder showing no geographic boundaries, the four Phase 3 DB controlled studies of esketamine in TRD 
were conducted in 21 different countries across 4 continents. The Phase 3 long-term OL study, TRD3004, 
was also international in scope, conducted in 21 countries across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, 
South and Central America, and Australia. Study TRD3002 was conducted at 47 sites in 5 countries 
(Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain, and United States), study TRD3001 at 42 sires in 9 countries 
and study TRD3005 at 57 sites in 13 countries. 
Consistent with scientific advice from the CHMP, at least 30% (278/702) of subjects across these studies 
were enrolled and treated at sites in the EU (overall: 39.6% [24.9% in TRD3001, 60.1% in TRD3002, and 
43.1% in TRD3005]). Between 39.9% and 51.1% of subjects in the 3 short-term Phase 3 studies were 
enrolled at sites in the North America (US) and between 24.9% and 60.1% were enrolled at sites in 
Europe. 
Age 
In TRD3001 and TRD3002, subjects 18 to 64 years (inclusive) were eligible for enrolment; TRD2003 
enrolled subjects aged 20 to 64 years (inclusive). Study TRD3005 targeted the elderly and the very 
elderly population with TRD (subjects ≥65 years). The evaluation of esketamine in an elderly population 
was important as TRD in this population is more severe and less responsive to treatment. Furthermore, 
treatment of depression in the elderly is challenging as patients not only commonly suffer from disability,

functional decline, and diminished quality of life from TRD, but also as a consequence of comorbid medical 
conditions.  
Gender 
For each of these 3 short term studies, approximately two-thirds of subjects were women (61.9% to 
70.5%), which is consistent with the gender distribution in the prevalence of MDD reported in 
community-based epidemiology studies. 
Previous antidepressant medications 
In each of the Phase 3 short-term studies (ie, Studies TRD3002, TRD3001, and TRD3005), all subjects 
met inclusion criterion for having had a nonresponse to at least 2 antidepressants (1 retrospective and 1 
assessed prospectively) in the current depression episode prior to randomization (unless otherwise 
specified in the sections about protocol deviations). 
The Massachusetts General Hospital – Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH-ATRQ), a 
reliable, and validated scale to determine treatment resistance in MDD, was used to document oral AD 
use and response (medication, dose, duration of treatment) in the current depression episode. Finally, 
written documentation of the MDD diagnosis and prior AD use from medical/pharmacy records was 
obtained. At the start of screening, as indicated in the MGH-ATRQ, nonresponse to 2 or more 
antidepressants was documented in 89.7% of subjects, and for the remaining 10.3% of subjects, 
nonresponse had been documented for 1 antidepressant. 
At baseline, all subjects had moderate to severe depression, a current depression episode that had 
persisted for an average of 2 to 4 years, and considerable functional impairment and a poor health-related 
quality of life at randomization. Additional independent qualitative and quantitative assessments were 
performed, including review of medical record documentation, to ensure that subjects without TRD were 
not enrolled in the studies. 
Retrospective assessment of prior AD nonresponse in current episode of depression: all subjects in the 
Phase 3 short-term studies were required to have had documented nonresponse (≤25% improvement in 
MADRS total score per clinical judgment) to at least 1 oral AD treatment taken for the current episode of 
depression prior to the initial screening visit, at adequate dosage and for an adequate duration, as 
assessed on the MGH-ATRQ and confirmed by structured interview and documented records. As the Phase 
3 studies were conducted globally, with variability in both the availability and accessibility to specific AD 
treatments, standardization of the type and maximum duration of AD treatments received prior to the 
first screening visit was not implemented as it would have hindered recruitment and limited the 
generalizability of the study results. The newly initiated AD treatments during the induction phase were 
restricted to only four: duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline and venlafaxine XR.  
Prospective assessment of AD nonresponse: at the initial screening visit, subjects must have been 
receiving treatment for the current depression episode with a different oral AD for at least 2 weeks at or 
above the minimum therapeutic dose (per MGH-ATRQ). This drug was continued prospectively for 4 
weeks during the screening/prospective observational phase. Only subjects who demonstrated 
(prospectively) nonresponse to the current oral AD after at least 6 weeks (≤25% improvement on MADRS 
total score from Week 1 to 4, together with a MADRS total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4 [≥24 for 
elderly subjects in TRD3005]), were eligible for randomization. Medication adherence was documented on 
the Patient Adherence Questionnaire during the screening/prospective observational phase to ensure that 
subjects took at least a minimum therapeutic dose of the current oral AD. 
All 3 short-term studies started by requiring prior nonresponse to ≥2 antidepressants in the current 
episode of depression, documented retrospectively at the start of the screening/prospective 
observational phase. These studies later were amended to allow prior nonresponse to ≥1 oral

antidepressants at the start of the phase but still ≥2 oral antidepressants by the end of the phase prior to 
randomization (with prospective confirmation of nonresponse to the ongoing antidepressant during the 
phase). 
The number of classes of previous failed antidepressant medication received prior to randomization for 
the short term DB phase 3 studies are summarised in the following Table. 
According to the EU Guideline on depression (EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2, 30 May 2013), patients 
who have not responded to at least 2 different AD treatments, at an adequate dose for an adequate 
duration, in the current depressive episode are considered to have TRD.   As such it should be made 
evident that the study participants belong to this patient group and have certain characteristics with 
special focus on treatment failures. The Applicant has used the conservative definition of 
Treatment-resistant depression with at least two treatment failures one of which prospectively shown and 
made a considerable effort to recruit treatment-resistant depressed patients according to the definition 
which exists in the current EU Depression Guideline.  The severity of a subject’s depressive symptoms in 
the current major depressive episode was also confirmed using a Site Independent Qualification 
Assessment (SIQA). 
It is noted that a high percentage of patients in the short term studies (~89.4% and 89.5% in TRD3001 
and ~92.1% in TRD3002 in the Esketamine + Oral AD group) had treatment failures with 2 or more 
specific antidepressant medications and (~74% and 78% in TRD3001 and ~80% in TRD3002 in the 
Esketamine + Oral AD group) had treatment failures with 2 or more classes of antidepressant 
medications. For the esketamine + oral AD group (N=343) 53.7% had 2 treatment failures, 25.2% had 3 
treatment failures, 8.5% had 4 treatment failures and 2.9% had 5 treatment failures or more. Prior to 
randomization in the 3 short-term studies, and to be considered to have TRD, subjects were required to 
demonstrate nonresponse to at least 2 different prior antidepressants in the current depressive episode, 
with nonresponse to 1 antidepressant demonstrated prospectively. To assess nonresponse, all studies 
used the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH-ATRQ). In addition, prior antidepressant use for the current episode of depression was verified by 
a site independent qualification assessment and confirmed with written documentation (eg, 
medical/pharmacy/prescription records or a letter from the treating physician, etc.). According to the 
Applicant, the severity of the depressive symptomatology at the time of randomization (ie, after 
treatment with at least 2 prior oral ADs), as well as the duration of the current episode, further supported 
the treatment-resistant nature of the depression experienced by subjects in the Phase 3 short-term 
double-blind studies. The various analyses provided for the population selected to be included in the 
studies are further reassuring that these patients belonged to the TRD spectrum.  
It should also be noted that in addition nonresponse to at least 1 antidepressant was assessed 
prospectively during the screening/prospective observational phase. It could be argued that 1 treatment 
failure assessed prospectively can suffice to define a treatment-resistant depressed patient, since TRD 
develops in a continuum with progressively higher resistance depending on the number and nature of 
interventions failed. With this in mind the population studied with esketamine can be considered as 
treatment-resistant depressed patients.

a  Specific antidepressants: In accordance with the protocols subjects entering the induction phase met the inclusion criterion for 
having had a nonresponse to at least 2 ADs (1 retrospective and 1 assessed prospectively). The data presented are the number of 
antidepressants with nonresponse (defined as ≤25% improvement) taken for at least 6 weeks during the current episode as 
obtained at the start of screening from the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH-ATRQ) results. See also Section of this document for further information about definitions of nonresponse.

tricyclic antidepressants; serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); 
or other. 
c  Duration: Prior antidepressant ongoing at screening was included in the analysis. For a subject with no ongoing prior 
antidepressant at screening, the last antidepressant taken within 1 week prior to screening was included. For a subject with 
multiple medications ongoing at screening, the medication with the longest duration was included in the analysis. 
Sources: The data are adapted from the TSIDEM table series presented in (or attached to) the sections about demographic and 
baseline characteristics in the Clinical Study Reports (Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3002/Sec4.2, Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3001/Sec4.2, and 
Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3005/Sec4.2), as well as tables in Appendix 6 of this document. 
The Applicant has also provided an analysis with the number of failed previous antidepressant 
medications. It appears that the percentage of patients who had only one failed previous AD medication, 
prior to randomisation and inclusion in the study (in order to investigate prospectively one more AD 
failure or not) were very low from 0.77% to 4.38%.

Table Q95_1: Number of Failed Previous Oral Antidepressant Medications in the Current 
Episode Prior to Randomization/Study Entry 
Phase 3 Relapse prevention Study in TRD (TRD3003) 
The study population consisted of adult men or women, 18 to 64 years of age (inclusive), who met the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for recurrent 
or single-episode major depressive disorder (MDD) (if single must have been ≥2 years) without psychotic 
features, based upon clinical assessment, and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI). In addition, subjects were required to have an Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology - Clinician-rated, 30 item (IDS-C30) total score of ≥34 (corresponding to moderate to 
severe depression). Treatment-resistant depression was defined as a lack of clinically meaningful 
improvement after treatment with at least 2 different antidepressant agents prescribed in adequate 
dosages for adequate duration. At the start of the 4-week screening/prospective observational phase, 
subjects were required to have had documented non-response to ≥1 but ≤5 oral antidepressant 
treatments taken at adequate dosage and for adequate duration, as assessed on the Massachusetts 
General Hospital - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH-ATRQ) for the current 
episode of depression and confirmed by documented records. Nonresponse at the end of the 
screening/prospective observational phase was defined as ≤25% improvement in the 
Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from Week 1 to Week 4 and a MADRS 
total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. Subjects were excluded from the study who had: a current or 
prior DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder; a history of suicidal behavior in the past 1 year; intent or 
suicidal ideation within 6 months before screening as clinically assessed by the investigator or based on 
the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) scale; a history of moderate or severe substance or 
alcohol use disorder according to DSM-5 criteria. 
Of the 705 enrolled subjects, 437 (62.0%) were directly enrolled into the 3003 study, 150 (21.3%) were 
transferred from the acute fixed dose study TRD3001, and 118 (16.7%) were transferred from the acute 
flexibly dosed study TRD3002.

Phase 3 OL Long-term Safety Study in TRD (TRD3004) 
Eligibility criteria for direct-entry subjects in TRD3004 were generally consistent with those specified for 
the Phase 3 short-term DB studies. Subjects were to be at least 18 years of age; have met DSM-5 
diagnostic criteria for recurrent or single-episode MDD, without psychotic features, and confirmed by the 
MINI; at the start of the screening phase, patients were to have had a nonresponse to at least 2 oral AD 
treatments in the current episode of depression as assessed retrospectively by the MGH-ATRQ and 
confirmed by documented records; and had a MADRS total score of ≥22 at screening. 
Unlike the Phase 3 DB studies (TRD3001, TRD3002, TRD3005, TRD3003), prospective confirmation of 
nonresponse to at least 1 oral AD was not required in the Study TRD3004 as this OL study was primarily 
designed for safety rather than efficacy objectives. 
The absence of prospective confirmation of nonresponse to at last 1 oral AD for the OL (mainly safety) 
study TRD3004 is not considered to be of concern, since the adjunctive antidepressant effect of 
esketamine has been investigated in one phase 3 study and in the relapse prevention study TRD3003.  
Treatments 
Initial Phase 1 studies with the nasal spray formulation in healthy subjects demonstrated that: (i) nasally 
administered esketamine was rapidly absorbed; (ii) plasma levels similar to those achieved after 0.2 or 
0.4 mg/kg IV esketamine could be achieved after nasal administration at doses of 28 to 84 mg 
esketamine; and (iii) esketamine nasal spray had good local tolerability. 
Phase 2 studies 
Study TRD2003 
Panel A: At the beginning of Period 1, 67 subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 
placebo, esketamine 28 mg, 56 mg, or 84 mg in a 3:1:1:1 ratio. At the end of Period 1, 28 subjects in the 
placebo group with QIDS-SR16 score ≥11 (ie, subjects who did not respond to placebo treatment) were 
randomly reassigned to a treatment group for Period 2. 
Panel B: At the beginning of Period 1, 41 subjects in Panel B were randomly assigned to receive treatment 
with placebo, esketamine 14 mg or esketamine 56 mg in a 2:1:1 ratio. At the end of Period 1, 13 subjects 
in the placebo group with QIDS-SR16 score ≥11 were randomly reassigned to treatment for Period 2. 
In both panels, each subject participated in up to 4 phases: a screening phase of up to 4 weeks, a 
double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 to Day 15) which included two 1-week treatment periods (Period 1 
and Period 2), an optional open-label treatment phase (Panel A: Day 15 to 74; Panel B: Day 15 to 25), 
and an 8-week post-treatment (follow-up) phase. 
Concomitant medications 
Panel A: In Period 1, the most common concomitant medication was bupropion, taken by a total of 17 
subjects. The next most common concomitant medications, each taken by 9 subjects during Period 1, 
were citalopram, clonazepam, sertraline, and vitamins. 
For the 28 subjects who were in the placebo group during Period 1 then reassigned to treatment in Period 
2, the most common concomitant medication in Period 2 was bupropion, taken by a total of 10 subjects. 
The next most common concomitant medications were clonazepam, sertraline, and vitamins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 57/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Panel B: In Period 1, the most common concomitant medication was mirtazapine, taken by a total of 17 
subjects. The next most common concomitant medication was duloxetine (taken by 15 subjects during 
Period 1). 
For the 13 subjects who were in the placebo group during Period 1 and then reassigned to treatment in 
Period 2, the most common concomitant medications taken in Period 2 were duloxetine and etizolam, 
each taken by a total of 5 subjects. 
Study SUI2001 
Standard of care antidepressant treatment was initiated or optimized for all subjects on Day 1. Subjects 
who had been taking a recently initiated antidepressant treatment at Screening (initiated <2 weeks prior) 
were permitted to continue taking the antidepressant at the same dose through to the end of the 
double-blind treatment phase (Day 25), if considered appropriate by the investigator. 
Two groups were evaluated during the DB period:  
Intranasal esketamine 84 mg, administered two times per week for 4 weeks, on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 
22 and 25 + standard of care antidepressant treatment. 
Intranasal placebo, administered two times per week for 4 weeks, on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 
+ standard of care antidepressant treatment. 
Phase 3 studies 
Amount of intranasal esketamine 
Dose selection was informed by the efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2 dose response study 
TRD2003. The lowest intranasal dose evaluated in Study TRD2003, 14 mg, was not carried into the Phase 
3 program for adult or elderly subjects due to insufficient efficacy.   
Across the Phase 3 studies, esketamine was administered at doses of 28 mg (elderly subjects ≥65 years 
only), 56 mg, or 84 mg. The Phase 3 short-term DB study TRD3001 evaluated 2 fixed doses of esketamine 
(56 mg or 84 mg). Flexible dosing of esketamine was evaluated in the other Phase 3 short-term studies, 
TRD3002 (56 mg and 84 mg) and TRD3005 (28, 56 mg, or 84 mg), as well as in the relapse prevention 
study TRD3003 and long-term OL study TRD3004.  
The final dose range (after titration) was chosen as 56 or 84 mg for adult subjects and 28, 56, or 84 mg 
for elderly subjects. For tolerability, all starting doses (56 mg for adults and 28 mg for elderly subjects) 
were lower than or equivalent to the ending dose. 
The fixed dose design in Study TRD3001 was used to separately evaluate the superiority of esketamine 
doses of 56 mg and 84 mg plus an oral AD to the oral AD + intranasal placebo comparator treatment. 
In the case of flexible dosing (pivotal) study TRD3002, the following scheme was allowed according to the 
protocol as described in the following Table. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 58/59 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4: Intranasal Treatment Administration during the Double-blind Induction Phase  
In this flexible dose Study TRD3002, 66.7% of patients in the esketamine nasal spray plus oral AD arm 
received 84 mg dose of esketamine nasal spray, indicating the need for up-titration to this dose in a 
substantial proportion of subjects. 
Frequency 
Data from the up to 9-week OL phase of TRD2003 showed that reducing the dosing frequency from twice 
weekly to weekly or every other week did not impact the ability to maintain the antidepressant activity of 
esketamine. In the longer-term Phase 3 studies (TRD3003 and TRD3004), the frequency of nasal dosing 
after the induction phase was individualized to once weekly or every other week to achieve the lowest 
dosing frequency for an individual subject that could sustain initial improvements in depressive 
symptomatology.  
The amount of esketamine and the dosing frequency used in the phase 3 trials is supported by data from 
the phase 2 studies. The use of a flexible dosing scheme is considered part of the everyday clinical 
practice, with which the depressed patient is being evaluated by the physician for its response and 
tolerability to treatment. It is not considered unusual to increase or decrease the amount of 
antidepressants to the minimum effective dose or modify the dosing frequency in order to achieve the 
best possible effect with good tolerability for the patient.   
Use of a new oral AD + intranasal placebo 
As mentioned above, key study design features, the use of placebo alone in clinical studies of outpatients 
with MDD (and by extension, TRD) was considered ethically controversial. For this reason, the design of 
the Phase 3 short-term studies included initiation of a new oral AD for all subjects at the start of the DB 
induction phase which, together with placebo nasal spray (to ensure blinding), served as the comparator 
treatment. In order for all subjects in the Phase 3 studies to receive a clinically optimized antidepressant 
treatment, consistent with various international depression treatment and some regulatory guidelines, a 
new open-label oral antidepressant was initiated on Day 1 of the double blind induction phase.  This was 
taken daily for the duration of this phase and no other changes were allowed.  
Objectives 
The study designs for the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies were used to assess the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of induction and maintenance treatment with esketamine in depression. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 59/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The objectives of the phase 3 studies to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of esketamine in the 
treatment of TRD can be misinterpreted, since the data submitted support the adjunctive use of 
esketamine as add-on therapy in the treatment of TRD.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the controlled Phase 3 short term studies was based on the change in 
depressive symptoms, as evaluated using the clinician rated MADRS. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale 
designed to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The 
MADRS was performed by independent remote raters during the study, using the Structured Interview 
Guide for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA). 
Key Secondary Efficacy Evaluations 
- Onset of Clinical Response by Day 2 (24 hours): The MADRS was also administered using a modified 
recall period of 24 hours for the key secondary efficacy evaluation related to onset of clinical response by 
Day 2 (24 hours) that was maintained for the duration of the double-blind induction phase with one 
excursion allowed. 
- Patient Health Questionnaire - 9-Item: The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9-Item (PHQ-9) is a 9-item, 
subject-reported outcome measure that was used to assess depressive symptoms. The PHQ-9 was used 
to assess depressive symptom domains of the nine DSM-5 MDD criteria and provide a complementary 
perspective to the clinician-reported MADRS (see Mod5.3.5.3/PHQ-9 for a measurement summary of this 
endpoint in TRD);  
- Sheehan Disability Scale: The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was used to assess the key secondary 
objective of functional impact and associated disability. The SDS is a widely used PRO to measure 
disruption to occupational, social and family function as functional impairment and disability in 
work/school, social and family life is not adequately captured in the MADRS  
Other secondary efficacy evaluations also included patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures evaluated 
in the Phase 3 studies in TRD such as: 
- Onset of Clinical Response by Day 8: The MADRS assessment with a recall period of 7 days was used for 
the secondary efficacy evaluation related to onset of clinical response by Day 8 that was maintained for 
the duration of the double-blind induction phase with one excursion allowed. 
- Clinical Global Impression of Severity: The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) provides an 
overall clinician-determined summary measure of the severity of the subject’s illness that takes into 
account all available information, including knowledge of the subject's history, psychosocial 
circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the subject’s ability to function.  
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale: The 7-item subject-reported Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 
7-Item Scale (GAD-7) was used to measure the secondary objective of symptoms of anxiety, as MDD with 
comorbid anxiety disorder has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and treatment nonresponse. 
- European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension - 5 Level: The European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension - 5 Level 
(EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for 
self-completion by respondents. The EQ-5D-5L consisting of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system of subjects’ 
current general health status across 5 dimensions and the European Quality of Life - Visual Analogue 
Scale (EQ-VAS) recording overall health status.  
Remission was defined as MADRS total score of ≤12, PHQ-9 total score ≤4 or SDS score ≤2 for each item 
and total score ≤6 at a given time point. Stable remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤12 for at 
least 3 of the last 4 weeks of the optimization phase, with 1 excursion of a MADRS total score >12 or one 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019

missing MADRS assessment permitted at optimization Week 13 or 14 only. Response was defined as ≥
50% improvement in MADRS total score or ≥50% improvement PHQ-9 total score or SDS score of ≤4 for 
each item and total score ≤12 at a given time point. Stable response was defined as ≥50% reduction in 
the MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1 of induction phase, prior to the first intranasal dose) in each 
of the last 2 weeks of the optimization phase, but without meeting criteria for stable remission. 
Relapse was defined as a MADRS total score ≥22 for 2 consecutive assessments separated by 5 to 15 
days and/or hospitalization for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event determined per 
clinical judgment to be suggestive of a relapse of depressive illness such as suicide attempt, completed 
suicide, or hospitalization for suicide prevention. 
Each of these assessments were conducted predose at clinic visits. 
The MADRS was used to calculate the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 2 and 3 short-term DB 
studies (TRD2003, TRD3001, TRD3002, TRD3005), as well as the secondary efficacy endpoints of onset 
of clinical response by Day 2 (TRD2003, TRD3001, TRD3002), response and remission rates (TRD2003, 
all Phase 3 studies), and long-term efficacy (TRD3004).  
The primary endpoint in the TRD3003 relapse prevention study was time to relapse. Secondary endpoints 
included evaluations of response and remission (based on improvement of depression symptoms using 
MADRS) as well as subject-rated outcome measures shown to be important in TRD.  
Study TRD3004 was primarily focused on safety and tolerability, but also had secondary efficacy 
endpoints, as described further in the Table with the completed Phase 3 studies (above) and in the Table 
below.

Study SUI2001: The primary efficacy endpoint was change in score from baseline to 4 hours after initial 
dose on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Clinician global judgment of suicide 
risk (from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool) was also assessed. Secondary endpoints 
included these measures at 24 hours and double-blind endpoint at day 25. 
The selection of the endpoints, the measurement of MADRS change from baseline to end point (after 4 
weeks in double-blind induction phase) and the difference of this change between treatments is 
considered appropriate and in accordance with the current guidelines, available literature and clinical 
practice. The randomised withdrawal design to evaluate relapse prevention is according to the current EU 
Depression Guideline. The long term study was not aiming to investigate recurrence prevention of the 
next episode, but this is not mandatory for marketing authorisation. The efficacy data collected together 
with the safety data should be able to provide useful information for the effect of intranasal esketamine as 
add-on therapy in TRD.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Sample size calculations and randomisation methods in the phase 3 studies were performed centrally and 
can be considered appropriate. 
With respect to blinding, the investigator was not provided with randomization codes. Due to the 
dissociative effects with esketamine, independent remote (by phone) blinded raters for MADRS 
assessment were used to maintain the blinding of the studies. Furthermore, the use of a bittering agent 
in the intranasal placebo and the use of 3 devices in each treatment session were additional precautionary 
measures to ensure that blinding was maintained and as such these are considered appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
For the short-term induction studies, the target of estimation (estimand) according to the Applicant was 
the hypothetical treatment effect when the drug was taken as intended in the protocol. However, the 
treatment effect that is of primary interest from a regulatory point of view is the effect regardless of 
treatment discontinuations, and if patients changing treatment to an alternative AD therapy had simply 
discontinued corresponding treatment(s) instead. Actually, it is somewhat unclear what treatment effect 
is targeted by the primary analysis ANCOVA (LOCF). However, ANCOVA (BOCF) that was provided as 
sensitivity analysis for studies 3001 and 3002, which was already recommended in the CHMP scientific 
advice as a possibility for missing data imputation, could be considered as a conservative analysis in 
accordance with the target of estimation of primary regulatory interest because BOCF assumes that all 
benefits potentially achieved from treatment are lost.

The primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses in Studies TRD3001, TRD3002, and TRD3005 included all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of nasal study medication and 1 dose of oral AD 
medication during the DB induction phase (termed, full analysis set).  
For the EU dossier, the primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in MADRS total score at Day 28, 
was analyzed based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using change from baseline to Day 28 
with last observation carried forward (LOCF) data with the model including factors for treatment, country 
(TRD3002) or region (TRD3001, TRD3005), and class of oral AD and the baseline MADRS total score as a 
covariate. Missing data in primary analysis were replaced using LOCF, whereby the last post-baseline 
value was to be carried forward; patients without post-baseline data were excluded from analysis, which 
is not considered appropriate, but numbers were negligible.  For non-EU countries, the primary efficacy 
variable was analyzed based on a mixed-effects model using repeated measures (MMRM) based on 
observed case data.  
Additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed for the ANCOVA analysis of change in MADRS 
total score at endpoint using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF) methods of imputation. 
Study TRD3001 applied a truncated fixed-sequence, parallel gate-keeping approach, and Study TRD3002 
applied a fixed sequence approach, to control type I error across the primary (change in MADRS total 
score) and the 3 prespecified key secondary endpoints. 
For studies 3001 and 3005, pre-planned interim analyses were conducted to re-estimate the sample size, 
or to stop the study for futility. The procedures that were put in place to ensure confidentiality of interim 
results to assure the integrity of the study were adequate. The interim analysis was appropriately taken 
into account for statistical testing and estimation.  
The treatment group difference in the proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response by Day 2 
(24 hours) that was maintained for the duration of the DB induction phase was analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test adjusting for country and class of antidepressant (SSRI 
or SNRI) in TRD3002 and using a weighted Fisher’s exact test for TRD3001. Changes from baseline at Day 
28 (or DB end point) in the SDS total score and PHQ-9 total score were analyzed using the same models 
as described for the primary analysis. 
In the relapse prevention study, the target of estimation (estimand) according to the Applicant was the 
effect ‘while on initially randomised treatment’. However, this is not the treatment effect of primary 
interest for assessment of maintenance of effect from a regulatory point of view because this effect is only 
related to the subset of the population that is on treatment, which changes with time because of 
treatment drop-outs. The treatment effect that is actually of primary interest is the effect regardless of 
treatment discontinuations and if patients changing treatment to an alternative AD therapy had simply 
discontinued corresponding treatment(s) instead. However, as the proportion of patients who 
discontinued treatment during the maintenance phase was relatively small (~10%), the strategy how 
intercurrent events are addressed is not of critical importance for the conclusions from the study. 
Furthermore, the pre-sensitivity analysis which was originally intended to serve another purpose can also 
be considered as sensitivity analysis for the effect of primary regulatory interest. 
The analysis set used for analysis of the primary endpoint included all randomized subjects who were in 
stable remission at the end of the OP phase and who received at least 1 dose of nasal study drug and 1 
dose of oral AD during the MA phase (ie, full [stable remitter] analysis set). The primary efficacy endpoint 
was the time from randomization to the first relapse during the maintenance phase in esketamine-treated 
subjects who achieved stable remission at the end of the optimization phase. The treatment groups were 
compared using the log-rank test statistic. The estimate of the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence

interval (CI) were calculated. The cumulative distribution function of the time to relapse was estimated by 
the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Study TRD3003 was designed with an interim analysis that allowed early termination of the MA phase for 
efficacy or to re-estimate the sample size (ie, required number of relapses). The two- stage design with 
sample size estimation at interim was adequately taken into account for statistical testing and for 
estimation. 
For MADRS, PHQ-9, CGI-S, GAD-7 and SDS, the change from baseline (for the maintenance phase) at 
each visit, including observed case and LOCF data, during the double-blind maintenance phase and at end 
point for the maintenance phase were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
(rank-based for CGI-S) with factors for treatment and country and baseline (maintenance phase) score as 
a covariate. Least-squares estimates of the treatment differences and 95% CIs are presented.

a  Only subjects whose current depressive episode had demonstrated nonresponse to at least 2 oral antidepressants prior to randomization were 
eligible to participate in these studies. 
b  These subjects were excluded from the analysis sets due to Good Clinical Practice issues found at 1 site during an audit, as described in the Clinical 
Study Reports (CSRs). 
c  Itemized reasons for withdrawal are described in Table 3 (for the double-blind induction phase) and in the CSRs (for all phases).

e   In Study TRD3002, N=6 from the esketamine + oral antidepressant (AD) group and N=17 from the intranasal placebo + oral AD group were 
withdrawn to participate in Study TRD3008. 
f  In Study TRD3001, N=34 from the esketamine 56 mg + oral AD group, N=29 the esketamine 84 mg + oral AD group, and N=44 from the 
intranasal placebo + oral AD group were withdrawn to participate in Study TRD3008. 
g  Although 169 subjects entered the follow-up phase, 1 subject in the esketamine 56 mg + oral AD group discontinued prior to performing the first 
scheduled visit; therefore, this subject is not counted as participating in the follow-up phase. 
Notes: The dashed lines (- -) show phases and studies that are not relevant to this Summary of Clinical Efficacy (SCE). In the follow-up phases, no

Interim analysis 
During all 3 short-term studies, several measures were implemented to improve study execution and 
enhance the quality of study conduct. While these measures were independent of the interim analyses in 
Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005, the measures may have contributed to the observed differential 
treatment effect on the primary endpoint for subjects enrolled prior to the interim analysis (Stage 1) or 
after the interim analysis (Stage 2), as the timing of these initiatives were considered to have the greatest 
impact on Stage 2. An analysis for Study TRD3002 evaluated whether similar differences between stages 
would have been observed had there been an interim analysis. Results were consistent with by stage 
analyses for Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005 in showing a larger treatment group difference for subjects 
who were enrolled later. Regarding a potential concern on confidentiality of interim results, it is reassuring 
that study 3002 without interim analysis showed a larger treatment group difference for subjects who 
were enrolled later in the analysis mimicking a by stage evaluation. As there were only slight differences 
in patient characteristics between stage 1 and stage 2, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference in 
patient populations between stage 1 and 2. Therefore a patient population in which esketamine on top of 
an oral AD would have a greater efficacy cannot be defined and it is considered that the observed effect 
estimates in the short-term studies can be generalized to the target patient population. 
Baseline data 
Across these studies, the mean baseline MADRS total score ranged from 35.2 to 37.6 (MADRS score >31 
signals severe depression71), and 75.2% to 83.3% of subjects across these studies were considered 
markedly to extremely ill based on Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) scores at baseline. 
The mean duration of the current depression episode was >2 years in all studies (115 weeks [~2.2 years] 
in TRD3002, 203 weeks [~3.9 years] in TRD3001, and 216 weeks [~4.2 years] in TRD3005), and a 
substantial proportion of subjects (41% to 63%) had a family history of depression. 
All subjects had non-response to at least 2 antidepressant treatments prior to randomization. 
Study TRD3001 (short term DB fixed dosing) 
In general, the treatment groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics. The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) age of all subjects was 46.3 (11.19) years, range: 18 to 64 years. The majority 
of subjects entering the study were female (70.5%) and white (76.6%). Medical history of hypertension 
was observed in 21.1% of subjects. The majority (57.3%) of the subjects initiated oral antidepressant 
treatment with an SNRI; 39.8% of subjects received duloxetine. The greatest percentage of subjects 
enrolled was in the United States (39.5%), followed by Brazil (16.7%), Mexico (13.2%), France (9.1%), 
Belgium (8.5%), Canada (5.8%), Estonia and Slovakia (2.9% each), and Hungary (1.5%). 
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 37.6 (5.51), ranging from 18 to 53, which is considered 
severe depression. Based on CGI-S scores, the majority of subjects (57.3%) were markedly ill (CGI-S 
score of 5). The mean (SD) duration of the current episode of depression was 202.9 (290.24) weeks. 
Subjects reported a family history of depression (62.9%), alcohol abuse (17.5%), and anxiety disorder 
(12.3%). Approximately 39.6% of subjects had a history (lifetime) of suicidal ideation as assessed using 
the C-SSRS, and 24.3% had a history (lifetime) of suicidal behavior. 
Study TRD3002 (short term DB flexible dosing)  
The treatment groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics. The mean (SD) age of all 
subjects was 45.7 (11.89) years, ranging from 19 to 64 years. The majority of subjects entering the study 
were female (61.9%) and white (93.3%). In addition, the majority (68.2%) initiated oral antidepressant

treatment with an SNRI, and more than half of subjects (54.3%) received duloxetine. The greatest 
percentage of subjects was enrolled in the United States (39.9%), followed by the Czech Republic 
(26.0%), Poland (17.0%), Germany (9.0%), and Spain (8.1%). A total of 20.2% of subjects reported a 
medical history of hypertension. 
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 37.1 (5.67), ranging from 21 to 52. Based on CGI-S 
scores, the majority of subjects (57.0%) were markedly ill. The mean (SD) duration of the current 
episode of depression was 114.6 (157.96) weeks. Subjects reported a family history of depression 
(48.0%), alcohol abuse (17.0%), and anxiety disorder (11.7%). Approximately one third (33.2%) of 
subjects had a history (lifetime) of suicidal ideation as assessed using the C-SSRS, and 10.3% had a 
history of suicidal behavior. 
Study TRD3005 (elderly patients) 
The treatment groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics. The mean (SD) age of all 
subjects at baseline was 70.0 (4.52) years and ranged from 65 to 86 years. Most subjects entering the 
study were female (62.0%) and white (94.9%). In addition, the majority (55.5%) initiated oral 
antidepressant treatment with an SSRI. The greatest percentage of subjects was enrolled in the United 
States (51.1%), followed by Sweden (10.2%), Italy (6.6%), Spain (5.8%), Poland (5.1%), South Africa 
(5.1%), and France (5.1%). A total of 53.3% of subjects reported a history of hypertension. 
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 35.2 (6.16), ranging from 19 to 51. Based on CGI-S 
scores, approximately half of the subjects (49.6%) were markedly ill and approximately one quarter of 
the subjects (24.8%) were severely ill. The mean (SD) duration of the current episode of depression was 
215.8 (341.7) weeks. Subjects reported a family history of depression (40.9%), anxiety disorder (8.0%), 
and alcohol abuse (7.3%). Approximately one-third (31.9%) of subjects had a history (lifetime) of 
suicidal ideation as assessed using the C-SSRS, and 14.1% had a history of suicidal behavior. 
Study TRD3003 (relapse prevention) 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of all subjects was 46.1 (11.10) years, ranging from 18 to 64 
years. The majority of subjects entering the study were female (64.8%) and white (90.1%). In addition, 
the majority of subjects (62.9%) initiated oral antidepressant treatment with an SNRI and 46.2% of 
subjects received duloxetine. Medical history of hypertension was observed in 20.9% of subjects. The 
highest percentage of subjects was enrolled in the United States (27.0%), followed by Poland (18.7%), 
the Czech Republic (14.0%), Brazil (9.1%), and Turkey (7.5%); 
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 37.9 (5.50), ranging from 4 (1 subject, with a score >28 
at screening with an unexpected significant score decrease on Day 1, who ultimately discontinued after 
the induction phase) to 53. Based on CGI-S scores, the majority of subjects (58.4%) were markedly ill 
(CGI-S score of 5). The mean (SD) duration of the current episode of depression was 132.2 (209.18) 
weeks (median 64.0 weeks). Subjects reported a family history of depression (45.1%), alcohol abuse 
(13.5%), and anxiety disorder (9.1%). A total of 27.4% of subjects had a history (lifetime) of suicidal 
ideation as assessed using the C-SSRS and 14.9% had a history of suicidal behavior. The mean (SD) 
IDS-C30 total score at screening was 47.2 (7.26), corresponding to severe depression. 
Study TRD3004 (OL long term safety) 
A higher percentage of subjects were women (62.6%) and white (85.5%) (Table 13). The median age 
was 53.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Elderly subjects (≥65 years) made up 22.2% (178) of subjects 
enrolled and of these elderly subjects, there were 19 subjects ≥75 years of age. The mean (SD) weight 
was 78.51 (18.426) kg, with 256 subjects who were either obese (28.4%) or morbidly obese (3.5%). A 
similar percentage of subjects received SNRIs or SSRIs for the oral antidepressant initiated on Day 1 of

the induction phase (see Section 3.6). Approximately 30% of subjects each received duloxetine or 
escitalopram, and approximately 20% of subjects each received sertraline or venlafaxine extended 
release. The highest percentage of subjects was enrolled in the United States (18.3%), followed by the 
Argentina (13.2%), Bulgaria (11.7%), Sweden (11.2%), South Africa (8.0%), Brazil (6.5%), and Spain 
(5.2%). A total of 27.4% of subjects reported a medical history of hypertension. 
Baseline psychiatric medical history and previous use of antidepressant medication was generally 
consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria (following Table from study TRD3004 CSR). The 
median age at time of diagnosis with MDD was 35 years (range [8; 72]). The mean (SD) baseline MADRS 
total score was 31.4 (5.39). Based on CGI-S scores, half of the subjects (51.0%) were considered 
markedly ill. The mean (SD) duration of the current episode of depression was 160.5 (261.80) weeks 
(median: 66.5 weeks and range [6; 2184]). Of the subjects in this study, approximately 40% of subjects 
were not responsive to 3 or more antidepressant medications. Subjects reported 1) a family history of 
depression (43.1%), 2) alcohol abuse (7.6%), and 3) anxiety disorder (7.6%). Approximately 
one-quarter (25.4%) of subjects had a history (lifetime) of suicidal ideation as assessed using the 
C-SSRS, and 15.4% had a prior history of suicidal behavior. Also based on the C-SSRS, 26.9% reported 
suicidal ideation within the past 6 months and 0.3% (2 subjects) reported suicidal behavior in the past 12 
months 
Numbers analysed 
Phase 3 studies 
Across the Phase 3 short-term DB studies, a total of 711 subjects were randomized and assigned to DB 
treatment at the start of the induction phase, of whom 702 were included in the full analysis sets used for 
primary analyses of efficacy in these studies (342 in TRD3001; 223 in TRD3002; 137 in TRD3005). In 
each of these studies, the overall proportions of subjects completing the DB induction phase was 86.8% 
to 91.0%. 
In the relapse prevention study TRD3003 stable remitters were 176 patients, from which 90 received 
esketamine and oral AD and 86 received oral AD and intranasal placebo.  
The open-label long term Study TRD3004 had no efficacy endpoints prespecified in the protocol and 779 
patients entered the induction phase while 603 entered the optimisation/maintenance phase.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study TRD2001 
Of the enrolled patients, 97% (29 of 30) completed the study. The least-squares mean changes (SE) from 
baseline to Day 2 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score for the esketamine 0.20 
mg/kg and 0.40 mg/kg dose groups were -16.8 (3.00) and -16.9 (2.61), respectively, and showed 
significant improvement (one-sided p=.001 for both groups) compared with placebo (-3.8 [2.97]). 
Esketamine showed a rapid (within 2 hours) and robust antidepressant effect. 
Study TRD2002 
In total, 67 (45 women) of 68 randomized patients received treatment. In the twice-weekly dosing 
groups, the mean change in MADRS score at Day 15 was -18.4 (SD=12.0) for ketamine and -5.7 
(SD=10.2) for placebo; in the thrice-weekly groups, it was -17.7 (SD=7.3) for ketamine and -3.1 
(SD=5.7) for placebo. Similar observations were noted for ketamine during the open-label phase 
(twice-weekly, -12.2 [SD=12.8] on Day 4; thrice-weekly, -14.0 [SD=12.5] on Day 5). 
Phase 2 Studies with Intranasal Administration 
Study TRD2003 
In the adaptive delayed-start design study TRD2003, consisting of a 2-week DB phase that included two 
1-week treatment periods, twice-weekly esketamine significantly improved depressive symptoms in 
adults with TRD. Efficacy was dose related, with doses of 56 mg and 84 mg demonstrating significantly 
greater efficacy than placebo. The 28 mg dose had a shorter duration of response, and the 14 mg dose 
was ineffective. The clinical effect was observed as early as 2 hours after the first dose. In the open-label 
(OL) phase (Days 15-74) following the DB period, in which the frequency of esketamine dosing was 
reduced to once weekly for 2 weeks and then to every 2 weeks, the antidepressant response appeared to 
persist for approximately 2 months after the last dose of esketamine 
The results for Panel A of Study TRD2003 have been published.  
Sixty-seven participants (38 women, mean [SD] age, 44.7 [10.0] years) were included in the efficacy and 
safety analyses. Change (least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score (both 
periods combined) in all 3 esketamine groups was superior to placebo (esketamine 28 mg: -4.2 [2.09], 
1-sided P=.02; 56 mg: -6.3 [2.07], 1-sided P=.001; 84 mg: -9.0 [2.13], 1-sided P<.001), with a 
significant ascending dose-response relationship (1-sided P<.001). Improvement in depressive 
symptoms appeared to be sustained (-7.2 [1.84]) despite reduced dosing frequency in the open-label 
phase. 
The results for Panel B of Study TRD2003 (conducted in Japan) have not been published but have been 
presented by the Applicant as an abstract. 
Forty-one participants (17 women, mean [SD] age, 44.5 [8.03] years) were included in the efficacy and 
safety analyses. In Period 1, the change (least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total 
score was significant at the 1-sided 0.10 level for the esketamine 56 mg group (-3.7 [2.81], 1-sided 
p=0.096) vs placebo, but not for the esketamine 14 mg group (+1.8 [2.62], 1-sided p=0.751) vs 
placebo. Results suggested a potential interaction of treatment with baseline MADRS total score: 
outcomes favoured the placebo group for subjects with higher baseline MADRS total scores and favoured

the esketamine groups for subjects with lower baseline MADRS total scores. In Period 2, the change 
(least-squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score was greater for the esketamine 14 
mg group (-5.9 [5.58]) vs placebo than for the esketamine 56 mg group (-0.5 [6.25]) vs placebo. 
Study SUI2001 
In Study SUI2001, the efficacy of esketamine was demonstrated in an associated population of subjects 
with MDSI. In this study, esketamine at a dose of 84 mg (given twice weekly over 4 weeks), when added 
to optimized AD treatment and inpatient hospitalization, resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms at 4 hours after the first dose 
Phase 3 short term studies 
Primary endpoint 
ANCOVA LOCF analysis of the change in MADRS total score from baseline to endpoint (please see also 
Table below with MMRM and ANCOV LOCF analyses results): 
For Study TRD3002, the results statistically favoured treatment with esketamine + oral AD over oral AD 
+ intranasal placebo; the estimated difference in MADRS change from baseline to Day 28/endpoint (95% 
CI) compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo treatment was -4.0 (-7.31; -0.64) points by MMRM, -3.5 
(-6.67; -0.26) points by ANCOVA LOCF and -3.5 (-6.70; -0.27) by ANCOVA BOCF analysis methods. The 
BOCF method of analysis is considered the most relevant.    
With respect to change in MADRS total score over time, the LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences 
(based on ANCOVA [LOCF]) were  3.6 (-6.05; -1.21),  2.8 (-5.08; -0.57), -2.1 ( 4.92; 0.64), and -3.4 ( 
6.43;  0.28) at Days 2, 8, 15, and 22, respectively.

for esketamine 84 mg + oral AD, the median unbiased estimate (95% CI) for the treatment difference 
versus oral AD + intranasal placebo was -2.0 (-5.52; +1.42). The least-squares mean difference 
(95% CI) using the most relevant analysis of the change in MADRS (ANCOVA BOCF) was -1.2 (-4.66; 
-2.32) (2-sided p=0.513). The results numerically favoured esketamine 84 mg + oral AD but did not 
reach statistical significance (2 sided p=0.250). 
for esketamine 56 mg + oral AD, the median unbiased estimate (95% CI) numerically favoured 
esketamine 56 mg + oral AD at -4.1 (-7.53; -0.60). The least-squares mean difference (95% CI) 
using the most relevant analysis of the change in MADRS (ANCOVA BOCF) was -4.3 (-7.79; -0.80) 
(2-sided p=0.017). Because the difference between the esketamine 84 mg + oral AD group and the 
oral AD + intranasal placebo group was not statistically significant, esketamine 56 mg + oral AD 
group versus the oral AD + intranasal placebo group could not be formally evaluated for treatment 
difference based on the predefined testing sequence.

For Study TRD3005, the estimated treatment difference (95% CI) of -3.6 (-7.20; +0.07) by MMRM and 
-3.6 (-7.16; -0.03) by ANCOVA LOCF analysis methods for esketamine + oral AD over oral AD + 
intranasal placebo suggests a clinically meaningful benefit. The results numerically favoured esketamine 
+ oral AD but did not reach statistical significance (2 sided p=0.052). 
The least-squares mean changes in the MADRS total score over time in Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001 
showed an improvement in clinician-rated depression symptoms that was apparent as early as 24 hours 
after the first dose of esketamine + oral AD (i.e., Day 2) that continued throughout the duration of the 
4-week induction phase. The mean treatment differences at Day 2 (based on MMRM analysis) were -3.3 
for the esketamine + oral AD group in Study TRD3002 and -3.0 and -2.2 for the esketamine 56 mg and 
84 mg + oral AD groups, respectively, in Study TRD3001 (corresponding values based on ANCOVA LOCF 
analysis were -3.6 for TRD3002, and -2.9 and -2.0 respectively, for TRD3001).   
MMRM was primary analysis only for non-EU countries; for EU, ANCOVA (LOCF) was primary. ANCOVA 
(BOCF) is considered the most relevant method of analysis.  
The results are presented using the BOCF analysis in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

a  For both MMRM and ANCOVA analyses, a negative difference favors esketamine. 
•  MMRM: For all 3 studies, the test for treatment effect is based on MMRM with change from baseline as the response variable and the fixed effect model terms for treatment, day, geographic area, class of oral AD 
(serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [SNRI] or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]), and treatment-by-day, and baseline value as a covariate. 
•  ANCOVA: For all 3 studies, the test for treatment effect is based on ANCOVA model with change from baseline as the response variable and factors for treatment, geographic area, and class of oral AD (SNRI or SSRI), 
and baseline value as a covariate. 
•  Both MMRM and ANCOVA: For treatment: in Studies TRD3002 and TRD3005 the terms or factors are Esk + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo; in Study TRD3001 the terms or factors are Esk 56 mg + oral AD, 
Esk 84 mg + oral AD, and oral AD + intranasal placebo. For geographic area: in Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005 the terms or factors are regions; in Study TRD3002 the term or factor is country. 
b  Difference: For Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005, the difference from placebo is the median unbiased estimate, which is a weighted combination of the least-squares means of the difference from placebo. For Study TRD3002, 
the difference from placebo is the least-squares mean difference between Esk + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo. 
c  95% CI: For Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005, this value is the 2-sided flexible CI for the difference from placebo. 
d  P-values: For Studies TRD3001 and TRD3005, the p-values are based on the weighted combination test statistic. 
e  Sequential p-values: Because the 84 mg dose was not statistically significant, 56 mg cannot be formally evaluated for treatment difference. The fixed sequence procedure is described in the Clinical Study Report 
(Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3001/Sec3.11.2.4). 
Notes: The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 points; a higher score indicates a more severe condition, and a negative change in score indicates improvement. 
Sources: The data are adapted from the TEFMAD table series presented in (or attached to) the sections about primary efficacy analyses in the Clinical Study Reports (Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3002/Sec6.2,

Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Assessment of Antidepressant Efficacy 
Currently 2 rating scales are accepted by health authorities: the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating 
Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-item version (HAMD). The primary 
endpoint most often used is difference in change in total scores of MADRS or HAM-D between new 
antidepressant and comparator at endpoint. 
The average treatment effect by HAM-D was -3.0 (SD=2.4) in studies conducted before 1995 and then 
was -1.8 (SD=1.0) in studies conducted since 1995. The average 2-point difference between 
antidepressants and placebo translates into a clinically meaningful treatment difference for well accepted 
antidepressants with proven efficacy. 
In studies which have used both HAM-D and MADRS scales, the differences at endpoint between drug and 
comparator is approximately 2-points for both scales10 and this is widely believed by academics to be 
sufficient as a criterion establishing obvious clinically meaningful benefit. 
According to the Applicant the data from some of the recently approved antidepressants for adjunctive 
treatment of depression and treatment-resistant depression are summarized in the table below, as 
examples of change in MADRS total scores. It is noted that not all of the active substances are approved 
in EU for the treatment of depression (e.g. aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and the combination of olanzapine 
+ fluoxetine are only approved in US for use in depression). 
Table 6: Summary Statistics of Treatment Effect Sizes for Approved Antidepressant Drugs 
Based on Change in MADRS Total Score 
According to the Applicant, in the Phase 3 DB short-term studies with esketamine, the LS mean treatment 
group difference for the primary endpoint ranged from -2.0 to -4.1 across studies, dose regimens, and 
analyses. These treatment differences are at least as large as the median treatment differences reported 
in placebo controlled clinical studies of currently marketed antidepressants in patients with an inadequate 
response to previous AD therapy or in active comparator-controlled (i.e., failed oral AD) studies of the 
olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (Symbayx). 
The effect size of -3.5 or -4.3, which was observed in the esketamine short term DB studies, is considered 
clinically relevant, since a difference of 2 between the test and the reference treatment or placebo has 
been previously considered sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the regulatory setting for monotherapy. 
However, in a number of publications provided by the Applicant there was a range in the treatment effect 
sizes for MADRS total score reported in individual published studies of approved antidepressant drugs 
either as monotherapy or add-on treatment, i.e. the MADRS difference of treatment from placebo was for 
quetiapine (add-on) from -1.19 to -3.05, aripiprazole (add-on) from -2.80 to -3.70, for brexpiprazole 
Assessment report

(add-on) from -1.19 to -3.12 and for vortioxetine from -0.5 to -7.1. Hence, the treatment effect observed 
with esketamine in TRD population is considered clinically relevant and meaningful.

Response and Remission Rate Based on MADRS Total Scores  
Differences in MADRS or HAM-D total scores versus placebo are considered important, but differences in 
response rates should also be demonstrated. 
For the 3 short-term studies (i.e., Studies TRD3002, TRD3001, and TRD3005), results for response and 
remission rates, defined using the MADRS total scores, at the end of the double-blind induction phase are 
shown in the following Table.  
In study TRD3001, the response and remission rates at Day 28 in the esketamine + oral AD groups were 
54.1% and 36.0% (for the esketamine 56-mg group), 53.1% and 38.8% (for the esketamine 84-mg 
group), and 38.9% and 30.6% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group. In study TRD3002 the response 
and remission rates at Day 28 were 69.3% and 52.5% of the esketamine + oral AD group versus 52.0% 
and 31.0% for the oral AD + intranasal placebo. The differences in response and remission rates can be 
considered at least comparable or even higher than those previously observed in studies with approved 
antidepressants. The statement by the Applicant that “a treatment difference of the magnitude observed 
in the end point (DB LOCF) response rates between esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal 
placebo in the Phase 3 short-term studies (i.e., 11% to 16%) has been considered clinically meaningful 
for approval of other ADs” is considered valid. 
As shown in the table across studies (for the 223 subjects in Study TRD3002, the 342 subjects in Study 
TRD3001, and the 137 subjects in Study TRD3005): 
•  Remission rates at Day 28 of the double-blind induction phase were higher in the esketamine + oral 
AD groups than in the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups across all 3 short-term studies. Remission 
rates ranged from approximately 36% to 53% for adult subjects or 17% for elderly subjects in the 
esketamine + oral AD groups and were 31% for adult subjects or 7% for elderly subjects in the oral 
AD + intranasal placebo groups.  
•  Response rates at Day 28 of the double-blind induction phase were higher in the esketamine + oral 
AD groups than in the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups across all 3 short-term studies. At Day 28, 
response rates in the esketamine + oral AD groups were 69% in TRD3002 (versus 52% for oral AD + 
intranasal placebo), and 54% and 53% in the 56 mg and 84 mg dose groups respectively of TRD3001 
(versus 39% for oral AD + intranasal placebo). In the “vulnerable and difficult-to-treat” elderly 
population in TRD3005, the response rate was 27% in the esketamine + oral AD group (versus 13% 
for oral AD + intranasal placebo). Furthermore, response rate data for TRD3002 and TRD3001 
provide further support for the rapid onset of antidepressant activity for esketamine, with rates after 
the first dose ranging from 16% to 19% in the esketamine + oral AD groups compared with 8% to 
11% for the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups (as mentioned earlier, MADRS was not assessed at 
Day 2 in Study TRD3005). 
In the esketamine + oral AD groups, remission rates (MADRS total score ≤12) at end point (DB LOCF) 
among adult subjects were 48.2% in TRD3002 and 34.8% and 35.4% in the 56 mg and 84 mg dose 
groups of TRD3001 (vs 30.3% and 29.2% for oral AD + intranasal placebo groups of both studies), and 
were 15.5% in the elderly population in TRD3005 (vs 6.3% in elderly oral AD + intranasal placebo group).

Higher than Expected Response to Oral AD + intranasal Placebo 
In short term DB studies TRD3001 and TRD3002, response rates after the first dose ranged from 16% to 
19% in the esketamine + oral AD group compared with 8% to 11% for the oral AD + intranasal placebo 
group (Mod2.7.3/App13). At end point (DB LOCF), response rates in the esketamine + oral AD groups 
were 63.4% in TRD3002 (vs 49.5% for oral AD + intranasal placebo) and 53.0% and 47.8% in the 
esketamine 56 mg + oral AD and esketamine 84 mg + oral AD groups of TRD3001, respectively (vs 
37.2% for oral AD + intranasal placebo). In elderly patients’ study TRD3005, the response rate at end 
point (DB LOCF) of the induction phase was 23.9% in the esketamine + oral AD group (vs 12.5% for oral 
AD + intranasal placebo). 
According to the Applicant, the response and remission rates in TRD3002 and TRD3001 for the oral AD + 
intranasal placebo group were considerably higher than expected based on those reported in the STAR*D 
trial (16.8% and 13.7%, respectively, based on 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) 
for adult patients with MDD at treatment step 3 (ie, comparable level of treatment resistance).

The United Kingdom's National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) uses a 10% difference in response 
rate to assess for clinically meaningful difference between 2 new antidepressant treatments. An 
assessment on efficacy of antidepressants by the CHMP set a 16% difference in response rates between 
antidepressant and placebo to be a clinically meaningful difference and noted that the difference in 
response rates for most approved antidepressants was between 13.1% and 19.5%. 
Despite the high percentages observed for oral AD+placebo, a consistent and increasing percentage of 
responders and remitters over time was observed during the short term DB studies further supporting the 
antidepressant effect of esketamine. 
A number of factors are known to increase the placebo response in trials of ADs. Some of the factors that 
likely contributed to the higher than expected response and remission rates observed for the oral AD + 
intranasal placebo groups in Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001 are highlighted below.  
• 
Use of a newly-initiated AD (to which the subject had not shown a previous nonresponse) in the 
comparator arm (ie, not a true placebo control) 
• 
High frequency of subject interaction with clinic staff due to the need for twice weekly visits (of 
approximately one-half day in length) during the induction phase, which imparts a high degree of 
attention and care.  
• 
• 
Use of nasal spray delivery system leading to a subject expectation of ‘something novel’ 
High patient expectation of benefit due to the portrayal in the media of ketamine as a ‘magical’ 
new treatment option for depression.  
• 
Nocebo response (ie, pseudo-adverse effect following an ‘inert’ treatment) as noted by an 
increase in CADSS scores after placebo nasal spray administration to which a bittering agent had been 
added to facilitate blinding  
Each of the above contribute to a significant expectation of benefit, which is one of the principal mediators 
of placebo response. While considerable care was taken to minimize other contributors to a placebo 
response in the Phase 3 studies with esketamine (eg, diagnostic uncertainty, rater drift), expectation of 
benefit is difficult to control. 
The argumentation provided by the Applicant is considered valid and reflecting the expectations of the 
depressed patients and the general situation in the field of major depressive disorder. The Applicant 
provided an analysis with the number of previous treatment failures in the patients who showed response.  
In TRD3001, the majority of oral AD + intranasal placebo responder subjects at endpoint had 2 failures 
(57.1%), followed by 3 (28.6%), and ≥4 (14.3%). In TRD3002, the majority of oral AD + intranasal 
placebo responder at endpoint subjects had 2 failures (77.8%), followed by 3 (11.1%), and ≥4 (11.1%). 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
The following 3 key secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed sequentially in Studies TRD3002 and 
TRD3001 according to the prespecified hierarchy: onset of clinical response by Day 2 [24 hours], change 
in SDS total score, and change in PHQ-9 total score to adjust for multiplicity and control type I error. 
Onset of clinical response. With respect to the onset of clinical response, the proportion of subjects with 
at least a 50% improvement from baseline in the MADRS total score by Day 2 that was maintained to Day 
28, was numerically higher for the esketamine + oral AD groups (ranging from ~8% to 10%) than for the 
oral AD + intranasal placebo group (ranging from ~2% to 5%). The odds ratio (95% CI) for onset of 
clinical response for the esketamine + oral AD group vs the oral AD + intranasal placebo group was 1.79 
Assessment report

(0.57, 5.67) for Study TRD3002, and was 6.47 (1.38, 60.45) and 5.34 (1.09, 50.91) for the esketamine 
56 mg and 84 mg dose groups, respectively, in Study TRD3001.  
The treatment difference of this key secondary endpoint was not statistically significant for TRD3002 
(2-sided p=0.321), and in the case of study TRD3001 it could not be tested statistically since the primary 
endpoint in the testing hierarchy was not significant for the esketamine 84 mg + oral AD group. 
Changes from baseline in SDS and PHQ-9 total scores. For both TRD3002 and TRD3001, the other 2 key 
secondary endpoints (change in SDS and PHQ-9) in the statistical hierarchy could not be formally tested. 
Nevertheless, results for both of these subject-rated clinical measures numerically favoured treatment 
with esketamine + oral AD. 
SDS total score. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences (based on ANCOVA [LOCF] analysis) for the 
SDS total score at end point (DB [LOCF]) in favour of esketamine + oral AD were -3.5 ( 5.85, -1.16) for 
TRD3002; -2.7 (-5.33, -0.01) and -1.7 ( 4.35, 0.85) and for the esketamine 56 mg and esketamine 84 mg 
groups, respectively, in TRD3001 (based on median unbiased estimate); and -2.8 (-6.39, 0.75) for 
TRD3005. 
PHQ-9 total score. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences (ANCOVA [LOCF] analysis) at end point 
(DB [LOCF]) for the PHQ-9 total score in favour of esketamine + oral AD were -2.2 (-3.93, -0.40) for 
TRD3002; -2.5 ( 4.53,  0.54) and -1.9 (-3.87, 0.08) for esketamine 56 mg and esketamine 84 mg groups, 
respectively, in TRD3001 (based on median unbiased estimate); and -2.7 ( 5.02,  0.45) for TRD3005. 
The results for key secondary efficacy endpoints cannot be used in a confirmatory way since they could 
not be analysed due to the fact that the most important prioritised endpoint in the hierarchical testing 
sequence (the onset of clinical response by Day 2 in TRD3002 and the primary endpoint for esk84mg+oral 
AD in TRD3001) did not show statistical significance. However, the results from the key secondary 
endpoints, cannot be disregarded and they did show a trend favouring esketamine + oral AD versus oral 
AD + intranasal placebo. The other secondary endpoints also showed a trend in favour of esketamine + 
oral AD versus oral AD+placebo, further supporting the antidepressant primary efficacy results. 
It should be noted that for the onset of clinical response at Day 2 (24 hours) in TRD3001 showed higher 
numerical values for esketamine 56mg  + oral AD (10.4%, 1-sided p=0.010) and esketamine 84mg + 
oral AD (8.8%, 1-sided p=0.041>p=0.025) vs oral AD + intranasal placebo (1.8%). Similarly, in 
TRD3002 the percentage that showed onset of clinical response by Day 2 (24 hours) was 7.9% for 
esketamine + oral AD and 4.6% for oral AD + intranasal placebo (p=0.321). Despite the fact that 
statistical significance was not achieved, it is obvious that a rapid onset of effect by Day 2 for esketamine 
+ oral AD was observed in both double blind phase 3 studies TRD3001 and TD3002.   
However, it is also noted that there is a considerable change in MADRS total score from Day 0 (BL) to Day 
2 (24hrs) (please see below Table with results from TRD3002 from TEFMAD03A: Montgomery-Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score: Means and Mean Changes from Baseline Over Time; 
Double-blind Induction Phase (Study ESKETINTRD3002: Full Analysis Set). Furthermore, this decrease 
does not follow the same rate of decline between Day 2 (24hrs) and Day 8. From day 8 onwards MADRS 
total score continue to decline considerably (Figure 6a with Least-squares Mean Changes (±SE) Over 
Time by ANCOVA LOCF for the Double-blind Induction Phases in Studies TRD3002, TRD3001). The 
“plateau phase” observed in the change of MADRS total score between Day 2 (24 hours) and Day 8 may 
be representative of the overlapping recall periods of these 2 assessments. 
For the first time it is noticed that efficacy starts earlier with a medicinal product in comparison to already 
approved conventional ADs (which usually requires a start of the effect at 2 weeks). This can be 
considered an important advantage, although a claim cannot be made due to the lack of statistical 
significance and a direct comparison.

Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Change in CGI-S score. Results for the clinician-rated CGI-S also showed greater improvements in 
depression ratings for esketamine + oral AD in each of the 3 short-term studies.  
Change in EQ-VAS score. Mean improvements from baseline to end point (DB) in the EQ-VAS score, which 
allows subjects to factor in concepts specific to their own situation in evaluating the best and worst health 
imaginable, were consistently numerically larger for the esketamine + oral AD groups compared with the 
oral AD + intranasal placebo groups in Studies TRD3002 (mean changes: 29.1 vs 20.9) and TRD3001 
(mean changes: 20.9 and 19.1 [56 and 84 mg dose groups, respectively] vs 14.9) 
Change in GAD-7 total score. A larger improvement in anxiety symptoms, based on the change from 
baseline in the GAD-7 total score, was observed for the esketamine + oral AD 56 and 84 mg groups 
compared with the oral AD + intranasal placebo group (LS mean treatment differences [95% CI] of -1.5 
[-2.84, -0.20] and -1.4 [-2.77, -0.12], respectively) in Study TRD3001 (Mod2.7.3/Sec2.3.2.2). A similar 
treatment difference for the change in GAD-7 total score favoring esketamine + oral AD was not observed 
in Study TRD3002 (LS mean treatment difference [95% CI] of -1.0 [-2.34, 0.34]). 
The other secondary endpoints also showed a trend in favour of esketamine + oral AD versus oral AD+ 
intranasal placebo, further supporting the antidepressant primary efficacy results 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses, performed to explore the consistency of results for the primary endpoint using pooled 
data for Studies TRD3001/TRD3002 (to provide additional precision as some of the subgroups were small 
in the individual studies), showed no major differences in the results as a function of age, gender, race, 
baseline MADRS total score, number of previous treatment failures in the current episode, functional 
impairment (based on baseline SDS total score), country, region, class of newly-initiated oral AD, or oral 
AD class history. Similarly, subgroup analyses based on data from TRD3005 showed no notable 
differences in treatment effects as a function of various subgroups. Subgroup analyses were supportive of 
the results for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.

Phase 3 long term studies - Study TRD3003 relapse prevention 
Primary endpoint 
Study TRD3003 relapse prevention 
A total of 705 subjects were enrolled and treated in Study TRD3003, including 437 (62.0%) who were 
directly enrolled, 150 (21.3%) who were transferred from TRD3001, and 118 (16.7%) who were 
transferred from TRD3002. A total of 121 esketamine-treated subjects demonstrated stable response at 
the end of the OP phase, were randomized to DB treatment in the MA phase, and were included in the full 
(stable responders) analysis set. In the combined group of stable remitters or stable responders 
randomized to continued esketamine treatment at the start of the DB MA phase in TRD3003, 60.5% 
received the 84 mg dose (55.6% of stable remitters) and 39.5% received the 56 mg dose (44% of stable 
remitters). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse in subjects achieving stable remission on 
esketamine + oral AD. 
In the full (stable remitters) analysis set, relapse events occurred during the MA phase for 26.7% subjects 
in the esketamine + oral AD group and 45.3% of subjects in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group. The 
estimated hazard ratio of esketamine + oral AD relative to oral AD + intranasal placebo based on 
weighted estimates was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29; 0.84), indicating that subjects who were stable remitters 
and were randomized to continue treatment with esketamine were, on average, 51% less likely to relapse 
than subjects who were stable remitters and were randomized to discontinue esketamine. The difference 
between treatment groups for the time to relapse was statistically significant (2-sided p=0.003).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The secondary efficacy results for the time to relapse by stable responders (but who were not in 
remission) showed a statistically significantly longer time to relapse in subjects randomized to continue 
esketamine compared to those randomized to discontinue esketamine (2-sided p<0.001). The estimated 
hazard ratio of esketamine + oral AD relative to oral AD + intranasal placebo was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.16; 
0.55), indicating that relapse was, on average, 70% less likely for stable responders who continued on 
esketamine treatment than for those who discontinued esketamine treatment 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Outcomes have been reported for assessments at the end of the maintenance phase, first for the stable 
remitters and then for the stable responders. Secondary efficacy endpoints numerically favoured the 
continuation of esketamine in measures of clinician-rated severity of depressive illness (MADRS and CGI 
S), subject-reported depressive symptoms (PHQ 9), anxiety symptoms (GAD 7), functioning and 
associated disability (SDS), and health-related quality of life and health status (EQ 5D 5L). 
Subgroup analyses 
Results of analyses of the primary endpoint in various subpopulations by gender, age group, region, 
number of previous treatment failures in the current episode, functional impairment, race, class of oral AD 
medication, country, consented protocol (before or after Protocol Amendment 4 [in which criteria for 
stable remission were amended] was adopted), entry source (direct entry or transferred entry), and oral 
AD medication (performed using the full [stable remitters] analysis set) generally showed a longer time 
to relapse for the esketamine + oral AD treatment group compared with the oral AD + intranasal placebo 
group, as indicated by the forest plots. 
Relapse prevention study  
As already mentioned above a relapse prevention study is required for a MAA in order to demonstrate the 
maintenance of the antidepressant effect. Study TRD3003 served as a relapse prevention study with a 
statistical significance in favour of esketamine + oral AD versus oral AD+ intranasal placebo. Results 
showed a statistically significantly longer time to relapse in patients randomized to continue esketamine 
compared with those randomized to discontinue esketamine among those who were in stable remission 
after 16 weeks of treatment with esketamine + oral AD, as well as among those who were in stable 
response (but not remission) after 16 weeks of treatment with esketamine + oral AD (2-sided p=0.003).

Subgroup analyses and secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of the results of the primary and 
key secondary endpoints. 
The proportional hazards assumption is obviously not fulfilled for the analysis of time to relapse. After an 
early separation of the curves shortly after start of maintenance phase, the difference between the curves 
remains almost constant over time, suggesting a large hazard ratio at the beginning and a hazard ratio 
around 1 afterwards. Therefore, the hazard ratio is not considered as the optimal summary measure to 
describe the difference in relapse risk, in particular because the overall hazard ratio as the ‘mean hazard 
ratio over event times’ is dominated by the early phase where most patients are at risk and most events 
are observed. Relapse proportion differences at fixed time points provide a better description of the 
treatment effect than hazard ratio. After 12 weeks, the relapse proportions (Kaplan-Meier estimates) 
were 13% in the esketamine + oral AD arm and 37% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo arm, 
corresponding to a difference of −24.0% (95% CI: −35.2%; −10.7%). After 24 weeks, the relapse 
proportions were 32% in the esketamine + oral AD arm and 46% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo arm, 
corresponding to a difference of −14.0% (95% CI: −28.1%; 2.7%).A tipping point sensitivity analysis 
showed that a 50 times increased risk (hazard ratio) after drop-out in the esketamine + AD group would 
be needed to change the conclusion of the trial (assuming that drop-out has no effect on relapse risk in 
placebo + AD group). As an increase in risk after treatment discontinuation at this size is considered 
unrealistic, the conclusions from the study are considered valid also when the treatment effect 
disregarding study discontinuation is of interest, which is of primary relevance from a regulatory point of 
view. 
Phase 3 long term studies - Study TRD3004 OL long term safety  
Of the 779 subjects who entered the induction phase, most subjects (74.5%; 580 subjects) continued to 
the optimization/maintenance phase. A total of 603 subjects entered the optimization/maintenance 
phase (580 from the induction phase and 23 responders from study ESKETINTRD300599), approximately 
25% of subjects completed the optimization/maintenance phase (24.9%; 150 subjects). 
Subjects treated with intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant in the induction phase showed a 
decrease (indicative of improvement in depression) from baseline (IND) in MADRS total score at endpoint 
(IND): mean change (SD) was -16.4 (8.76). The mean (SD) change from baseline in the MADRS total 
score remained largely unchanged throughout the 48-week OP/MA phase for those subjects who entered 
that phase, with the mean (SD) change from the baseline to end point of the OP/MA phase being 0.3 
(8.12). 
At the induction endpoint, the response rate (defined as ≥50% reduction in the MADRS total score from 
baseline) was 78.4% (593/756) and the remission rate (defined as a MADRS total score ≤12) was 47.2% 
(357/756). Of the subjects proceeding to the OP/MA phase, 76.5% (461/603) had met the criteria for 
response and 58.2% (351/603) were in remission at end point (OP/MA).

Figure 7: Arithmetic Means (+/- SE) for Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) Total Score Over Time Observed Case; (Study ESKETINTRD3004: All Enrolled 
Analysis 
Set)
A similar pattern was observed for PHQ-9, GAD-7 and SDS. CGI-S and EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS score 
appeared to support the findings of the MADRS total score and the improvement of the health status in 
the induction phase (IND), which was maintained in the optimisation/maintenance phase (OP/MA).  
It appears that there were improvements in measurements of depression in the induction phase of this 
open label long term study and these were consistent across multiple assessments of depressive 
symptoms over the 4-week induction phase. In addition, these improvements appeared to be maintained 
in subjects who continued treatment up to the 1-year exposure. This provides further evidence of the 
maintenance of the antidepressant effect of esketamine in an adjunctive setting. The analysis for the 150 
subjects who completed the optimisation/maintenance phase from the baseline of the induction phase 
presented the same pattern as the total population.  
Ancillary analyses 
Phase 3 short term studies 
MMRM analysis of the change in MADRS total score from baseline to Day 28: 
For Study TRD3002, the least-squares mean treatment difference (95% CI) of esketamine + oral AD from 
oral AD + intranasal placebo was 4.0 (-7.31; -0.64); this difference was statistically significant (2 sided 
p=0.020) in favour of esketamine + oral AD. 
For Study TRD3001,

• 
• 
For esketamine 84 mg, the median unbiased estimate (95% CI) for the treatment difference versus 
oral AD + intranasal placebo was -3.2 (-6.88; +0.45). The results numerically favoured esketamine 
84 mg + oral AD but the treatment difference was not statistically significant (2-sided p=0.088). 
For esketamine 56 mg, the median unbiased estimate (95% CI) for the treatment difference versus 
oral AD + intranasal placebo was -4.1 (-7.67; -0.49). The results numerically favoured esketamine 56 
mg + oral AD. However, because the difference between the esketamine 84 mg + oral AD group and 
the oral AD + intranasal placebo group was not statistically significant, the esketamine 56 mg + oral 
AD group versus the oral AD + intranasal placebo group could not be formally evaluated for treatment 
difference based on the predefined testing sequence. 
For Study TRD3005, the median unbiased estimate (95% CI) for the treatment difference of esketamine 
+ oral AD versus oral AD +placebo was -3.6 (-7.20; +0.07). The results numerically favoured esketamine 
+ oral AD but did not reach statistical significance (2-sided p=0.059). 
It is noted that analysis of the results with MMRM provided the same effect size as that with ANCOVA LOCF 
analysis. This can be reassuring with respect to the outcome of the phase 3 studies. BOCF is considered 
the most relevant analysis and the results for phase 3 study in older patients were reanalysed using BOCF 
analysis, as in the case of studies TRD3001 and TRD3002.

Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study conducted at 
multiple sites in the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain, and the United 
States to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of flexibly dosed 
intranasal esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral 
antidepressant (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine extended

The maximum duration of the study was 11 
weeks (subjects who continued into the efficacy 
maintenance study ESKETINTRD3003) or 35 
weeks (subjects who completed the follow-up 
phase). The study had 3 phases: a 4-week

Database lock 
Two database locks were planned for this study as indicated in the protocol. The 
first database lock was on 11 July 2017 and included data from the double-blind 
phase and data from subjects who had completed the first 2 weeks of the 
follow-up phase. The analyses for these data were run following this first 
database lock. The subject treatment assignment was revealed only to the 
Applicant’s study staff. The investigators and the site personnel remained 
blinded to the treatment assignment until all subjects completed study 
participation through the follow-up phase. The second database lock was on 18 
December 2017, for the remaining follow-up phase data (up to 6 months). 
Study Period: 07 August 2015 (date first subject signed informed consent) to 
06 November 2017 (date of last observation for last subject recorded as part of 
the database).

Treatment-resistant Depression 
Study name: Trial of Rapid-acting Intranasal Esketamine for Treatment-resistant Major Depressive 
Disorder (TRANSFORM-3) 
Study identifier 
Design 
ESKETINTRD3005, EudraCT Number: 2014-004588-19, NCT No.: 
NCT02422186, Clinical Registry No.: CR107129 
randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in Belgium, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, South Africa, Spain, 
Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of flexibly dosed intranasal esketamine (28 mg, 56 mg or 
84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (duloxetine, escitalopram, 
sertraline or venlafaxine extended release [XR]), compared with a newly 
initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo in 
male and female elderly subjects with TRD. An Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) was established to monitor data to ensure the continuing 
safety of the subjects enrolled in this study. In addition, the committee was to 
review 1 interim analysis (IA) for a potential sample size re-estimation or to 
stop the study for futility. 
Duration of 
screening/prospective 
observational phase:   
a 4-week screening/prospective observational 
phase, followed by an optional up to 3-week 
period to taper the current antidepressant 
medication or to optimize medical management 
Duration of double-blind 
induction phase:   
4-weeks  
Duration of post-treatment 
follow-up phase: 
  2-weeks  
The maximum duration of a subject’s 
participation in the current study was 8 to 11 
weeks (for subjects continuing into 
ESKETINTRD3004) or 13 weeks (for subjects 
completing the follow up phase). 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of switching 
elderly subjects with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) from a prior 
antidepressant treatment (to which they have not responded) to flexibly dosed 
intranasal esketamine (28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral 
antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant 
(active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms, 
as assessed by the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from Day 1 (pre randomization) to the end of 
the 4-week double-blind induction phase.

Database lock 
The first database lock was on 11 September 2017 and included all data from the 
double-blind induction phase and the follow-up phase. The analyses for these 
data were run following this first database lock. 
Following a regulatory agency’s review of the AE coding, the database was 
re-opened to recode certain preferred terms in the Phase 3 program to facilitate 
the agency’s review of the marketing application. A list of terms that were revised 
are provided in Attachment Revised Terms. The database was re-locked on 3 May 
2018 and 8 June 2018 after recoding the adverse events. At the time of the first 
database lock, it was noted that some of the Database Release Plan specifications 
were not met and that the database was locked with exceptions. In addition,

discrepancies were found in the clinical database after database lock. Please refer 
to Attachment DB_Exceptions for a list of exceptions noted at the time of 
database lock and discrepancies found after database lock.  
The Applicant considers that the discrepancies in the database did not impact the 
conclusions of the study.

During this study, a for cause clinical site audit for a different study 
(ESKETINTRD3004) was performed at Site US10009. At the time of the audit 3 
subjects were screened, 2 were screen failures, and the remaining subject was 
discontinued after the Day 8 induction phase visit in ESKETINTRD3005. None 
of the subject source data or Trial Center File for this protocol was 
reviewed. The same staff that conducted ESKETINTRD3004 also conducted the 
ESKETINTRD3005 trial. 
Because of the audit findings, the one subject enrolled at the site was not 
included in any of the analysis sets for the study (ie, not included in the all 
randomized analysis set, full analysis set, safety analysis set, or follow-up 
analysis set). The instances of GCP noncompliance at Site US10009 are not 
considered to have had an impact on the overall conclusions of the study. This 
site was closed due to GCP noncompliance and reported to the Office of 
Scientific Investigations. 
Data from this study for the 1 subject at Site US10009 are presented in the 
tables and listings in this CSR as listed in Table 12. 
Analysis description  MMRM and ANCOVA LOCF 
The full analysis set included 137 subjects, as follows: 
There were 2 analysis phases defined in this study: double-blind induction phase 
and follow-up (post-treatment) phase.

Double-blind, multicenter, relapse prevention study using a randomized 
withdrawal design in adult men and women with TRD who had achieved stable 
remission or stable response after an induction and optimization course of 
treatment with intranasal esketamine + oral antidepressant. The study 
assessed the relative safety and efficacy of continuation versus discontinuation 
of intranasal esketamine, in the presence of an ongoing oral antidepressant, in 
subjects who were in stable remission. 
This study had 5 phases: a screening/prospective observational phase 
(direct-entry subjects only); an open-label induction phase (direct-entry 
subjects only); an optimization phase (both direct-entry and transferred-entry 
subjects); a maintenance phase (both direct-entry and transferred-entry 
subjects); and a 2-week post-treatment follow-up phase. 
Duration of 
screening/prospective 
observational phase 
(direct-entry subjects only) 4 weeks in duration 
with an optional 3-week taper period for oral 
antidepressant (direct-entry subjects only), 
open label 
Duration of induction phase: 
(direct-entry subjects only) 4-week open label 
induction phase (intranasal esketamine + oral 
antidepressant; direct entry subjects only) 
Duration of optimisation 
phase: 
(both direct-entry and transferred-entry 
subjects) 12 weeks (intranasal esketamine + 
oral antidepressant or oral antidepressant + 
intranasal placebo; all subjects) 
Duration of maintenance 
phase:  
(both direct-entry and transferred-entry 
subjects) a variable length of time until subjects 
experienced a relapse event, met 
discontinuation/withdrawal criteria, or until the 
required number of relapses occurred among 
randomized subjects in stable remission based 
on interim analysis (IA) results. 
Duration of follow-up phase: 
2 weeks post-treatment follow-up phase 
(subjects who do not enter the open-label 
safety extension study 54135419TRD3008) 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of intranasal 
esketamine + oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant + 
intranasal placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms in subjects with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who were in stable remission after an 
induction and optimization course of intranasal esketamine + oral 
antidepressant.

Database lock 
Two database locks were planned for this study as indicated in the protocol. The 
first database lock was on 11 July 2017 and included data from the double-blind 
phase and data from subjects who had completed the first 2 weeks of the 
follow-up phase. The analyses for these data were run following this first 
database lock. The subject treatment assignment was revealed only to the 
Applicant’s study staff. The investigators and the site personnel remained blinded 
to the treatment assignment until all subjects completed study participation 
through the follow-up phase. The second database lock was on 18 December 
2017, for the remaining follow-up phase data (up to 6 months). Study Period: 
07 August 2015 (date first subject signed informed consent) to 06 November 
2017 (date of last observation for last subject recorded as part of the database).

(direct-entry subjects only). 
Full (OP): All subjects who received at least 1 dose of intranasal esketamine 
study drug and 1 dose of oral antidepressant in the optimization phase. 
There were 2 full analyses sets defined for the maintenance phase: 
• 
           - Full (stable remitters): used to perform primary and secondary efficacy 
evaluations on randomized subjects who were in stable remission at the end of 
the optimization phase and who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study drug 
and 1 dose of oral antidepressant during the maintenance phase. 
           - Full (stable responders): used to perform secondary efficacy evaluations 
on randomized subjects who were stable responders (who were not stable 
remitters) at the end of the optimization phase and who received at least 1 dose 
of intranasal study drug and 1 dose of oral antidepressant during the 
maintenance phase.

Remission was defined as MADRS total score of ≤12, PHQ-9 total score ≤4 or 
SDS score ≤2 for each item and total score ≤6 at a given time point. Stable 
remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤12 for at least 3 of the last 4 
weeks of the optimization phase, with 1 excursion of a MADRS total score >12 
or one missing MADRS assessment permitted at optimization Week 13 or 14 
only. Response was defined as ≥50% improvement in MADRS total score or 
≥50% improvement PHQ-9 total score or SDS score of ≤4 for each item and 
total score ≤12 at a given time point. Stable response was defined as ≥50% 
reduction in the MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1 of induction phase, 
prior to the first intranasal dose) in each of the last 2 weeks of the optimization 
phase, but without meeting criteria for stable remission. 
Relapse was defined as a MADRS total score ≥22 for 2 consecutive 
assessments separated by 5 to 15 days and/or hospitalization for worsening 
depression or any other clinically relevant event determined per clinical 
judgment to be suggestive of a relapse of depressive illness such as suicide 
attempt, completed suicide, or hospitalization for suicide prevention.

During this study, a for-cause clinical site audit was performed at site PL10002 
(Poland), because the Applicant was informed by local representatives of 
possible GCP noncompliance at the site. Seven subjects from this site were 
transferred entry from ESKETINTRD3002 and 7 were directly enrolled. 
The instances of GCP noncompliance at Site PL10002 were not considered to 
have had an impact on the overall conclusions of the study, as none of these 
subjects met the criteria for stable remission. However, as a result of these 
audit findings, the 14 subjects from site PL10002 were not included in any of 
the analysis sets for the study (ie, not included in the all randomized analysis 
set, full analysis set, or follow-up analysis set).

Wassmer taking two stage design into account. 
Number of Subjects in Each Phase and Analysis Set (Study ESKETINTRD3003: 
All Enrolled Analysis Set) 
In addition to the subgroup analysis of pre/post Amendment 4 (Section 6.2.5), 
the Cox proportional hazards model and unweighted log-rank test was 
performed post-hoc on the 167 subjects who met the more stringent definition 
per pre-Amendment 4 to evaluate the robustness of the results. The HR (95% 
CI) for the 167 subjects was 0.44 (0.26; 0.74) with a 2-sided p-value of 0.002 
(Attachment TEFREL02B). This result was consistent with the primary efficacy 
analysis.

1-year open-label, long-term study conducted at multiple sites in Argentina, 
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, 
Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States. This study evaluated 
intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (duloxetine, 
escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine extended release [XR]) in adult subjects 
with treatment-resistant depression. An Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) was established to monitor data to ensure the continuing 
safety of the subjects enrolled in this study. 
This long-term study included 4 phases: ≤4-week screening phase (direct-entry 
subjects only), a 4-week induction phase (direct-entry subjects and 
transferred-entry non-responder subjects), and a 48-week

optimization/maintenance phase (all responder subjects from the open-label 
induction phase of this study, and transferred-entry responder subjects), and 
4-week follow-up phase (available for all subjects). 
The maximum duration of a subject’s participation in this study was to be 60 
weeks for direct-entry subjects; 56 weeks for transferred-entry non-responder 
subjects, and 52 weeks for transferred-entry responder subjects. The end of the 
study occurred when at least 300 subjects received treatment with esketamine 
for 6 months and at least 100 subjects for 12 months including both direct-entry 
and transfer-entry subjects.

The primary objective of the study was to assess the long-term safety and 
tolerability of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant in 
subjects with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), with special attention to the 
following: potential effects on cognitive function; potential treatment-emergent 
symptoms of cystitis and/or lower urinary tract symptoms; potential withdrawal 
and/or rebound symptoms following cessation of intranasal esketamine 
treatment.

A total of 802 subjects were enrolled in this study. Of the 779 subjects who 
entered the induction phase (included 88 non-responders from study 
ESKETINTRD3005), most subjects (74.5%; 580 of 779 subjects) continued to the 
optimization/maintenance phase. Of the 802 subjects enrolled, 364 subjects 
(45.4%) were treated for 6 months and 136 subjects

At database lock for this study on 11 January 2018, it was noted that some of the 
Database Release Plan specifications were not met and that the database was 
locked with exceptions. In addition, discrepancies were found in the clinical 
database after database lock. Please refer to Attachment DB Exceptions for a list 
of exceptions noted at the time of database lock and discrepancies found after 
database lock. The medical history of spontaneous abortion of subjects 
40540102 and 40900503 were not entered into the eCRF (Attachment 
DB_Exceptions) but were reported in the CIOMS reports. The subjects were 
reported as pregnant during treatment. Both subjects experienced a 
spontaneous abortion, one occurred during the optimization/maintenance phase 
the other occurred after the study (See Section 7.4.12 of the CSR). The Applicant 
considers that the discrepancies in the database did not impact the conclusions of 
the study. Following a regulatory agency’s review of the adverse event coding, 
the database was re-locked for this study on 3 May 2018 and 13 June 2018 to 
recode specific preferred terms in the Phase 3 program in order to facilitate the 
agency’s review of the marketing application. A list of terms that were revised are 
provided in Attachment Revised Terms. 
Results and Analysis 
Analysis description  Primary Analysis 
Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
In addition to direct entry subjects, subjects who were nonresponders from a 
previous study (ESKETINTRD3005) after having had 4 weeks of treatment with 
either esketamine plus oral antidepressant or placebo plus oral antidepressant 
in the previous study, entered the induction phase. Not all subjects who entered 
the induction phase progressed to the optimization/maintenance phase. Only 
subjects who completed the induction phase and were responders, entered the 
optimization/maintenance phase. In addition, responders from study 
ESKETINTRD3005 were allowed to enter the optimization/maintenance phase 
after having had 4 weeks of treatment with either esketamine plus oral 
antidepressant or placebo plus oral antidepressant. Because the study was 
considered completed based on the exposure criteria, some subjects could not 
complete the full duration of the optimization/maintenance phase.  
Efficacy analyses of data from the induction phase and 
optimization/maintenance phase were based on the full analysis sets, that were 
defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of esketamine or 1 dose of oral 
antidepressant medication during the respective phase. 
Subjects in the follow-up phase were those who entered that phase.  
Due to GCP issues at one study site, 21 subjects from this site were not included 
in the analysis sets; however, data for this site are presented in listings.

Notes 
Because this was an open-label study without a comparator group, the 
interpretation of the efficacy results is limited. Assessment of efficacy was a 
secondary objective of this study. Indicators of improvement were consistently 
observed for depression symptoms and other efficacy assessments by the end of 
the 4-week induction phase, and appeared to be sustained in subjects who 
continued treatment up to 1-year of exposure. It should be noted that subjects 
in the induction phase were either direct-entry or nonresponders from the 
4-week induction phase of another study (ESKETINTRD3005). In addition, only 
responding subjects from the induction phase of study ESKETINTRD3004 were

allowed to enter the optimization/maintenance phase and were supplemented 
by responders from the 4-week induction phase of study ESKETINTRD3005. 
Subjects treated with esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant at 
the start of the induction phase showed a decrease (ie, improvement) in 
MADRS total score: mean change (SD) from baseline of the induction phase in 
MADRS total score to the endpoint of the induction phase was -16.4 (8.76) in 
756 subjects. Of note, the mean (SD) MADRS total score at baseline of the 
induction phase was 31.4 (5.39) among enrolled subjects. During the 
optimization/maintenance phase (n=603): mean change (SD) in MADRS total 
score from baseline of the optimization/maintenance phase to the endpoint of 
the optimization/maintenance phase was 0.3 (8.12). 
The main limitation of this study was that treatment was open-label with no 
comparator group. Based on predefined criteria related to achieving the 
required number of exposures at 6 and 12 months (ie, 364/802 and 136/802, 
respectively), not all enrolled subjects completed the full planned duration of 
the study.

Phase (Study ESKETINTRD3004: Full (OP/MA) Analysis Set) 
An internal audit was conducted from 22-Jun-2016 thru 24-Jun-2016 based on 
previous findings from a Janssen Site Manager during data reviews of site 
US10025. There were serious data integrity issues due to lack of PI oversight 
and a lack of adverse event reporting. In addition, vital sign data did not show 
the expected variability. The site was closed on 06-Jul-2016 and all subjects 
were withdrawn from the study (Appendix 8 Audit Certificate). Because of 
these audit findings, data from 21 subjects from Site US10025 (19 who 
received esketamine treatment and 2 who did not receive esketamine 
treatment) were not included in any of the analysis sets for the study 
(Appendix 17 LSIEXPE01A). The instances of GCP noncompliance at Site 
US10025 were not considered to have had an impact on the overall conclusions 
of the study. Data from this study for the 21 subjects at Site US10025 are 
presented separately and not included in summary tables.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Results for Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001 generally were not pooled due to differences in study design. 
However, analyses are provided here for efficacy in select subpopulations using data pooled for adults in 
Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001.  
According to the Applicant, the results for Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001 generally were not pooled due 
to differences in study design. This section is an exception in accordance with the ICH guideline, which 
states for the "Comparison of Results in Subpopulations" section of an SCE that "given the limited sample 
sizes in individual studies, analyses across multiple studies should be performed."  Accordingly, analyses 
have been provided for efficacy in select subpopulations using data pooled for adults in Studies TRD3002 
and TRD3001. These analyses of pooled data were performed to increase the precision of efficacy 
estimates in adult subpopulations.  
For psychiatric history and the severity of MDD at baseline, the MADRS total score had a mean (SD) value 
of 37.4 (5.57) points, which represented severe depression (as described in Section 3.2.3 of this SCE). 
The CGI S results indicated that 57.2% of subjects were markedly ill (with a score of 5 out of 7 points), 
24.1% of subjects were severely ill (with a score of 6 out of 7 points), and 17.0% of subjects were 
moderately ill (with a score of 4 out of 7 points), with <2% of subjects in any of the other categories each. 
For the 2 short-term studies of adults (i.e., for Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001), pooled information about 
prior oral antidepressants is shown in the following Table. The prior oral antidepressants were generally 
similar across treatment groups. A summary for the overall population of 565 adult subjects is provided 
below. 
Exposure-response 
The Applicant has performed a descriptive analysis to assess the improvement in efficacy of the 84 mg 
dose of esketamine over the 56 mg dose by evaluating the proportion of subjects who achieved clinical 
response or remission in the double-blind phase of the studies TRD3001, TRD3002, and TRD3005. The 
results are presented in the following Figures.

The Applicant has also performed an exposure-response analysis to explore the dose (or exposure) vs. 
response relationships of esketamine, using the change in MADRS scores from baseline as response. Data

from 696 subjects (410 subjects who administered a new OA and nasal esketamine, and 286 subjects 
who administered nasal placebo and a new OA) who were enrolled in studies TRD3001, TRD3002, and 
TRD3005 were included in the exposure-response analysis. 
Linear drug effect was estimated with good precision in young adult subjects (TRD3001 and TRD3002) 
but not in elderly subjects (TRD3005). Therefore, a pooled analysis was performed on studies TRD3001 
and TRD3002. Figure 12 shows the linear relationship between the average esketamine dose and the 
esketamine placebo-corrected ΔMADRS effect, based on these data. The esketamine effect on ΔMADRS 
was estimated to be 1.308 (95%CI: 0.666; 1.950) points per 28-mg increase in the average esketamine 
dose.

Prior oral antidepressants during screening: 
Specific types of antidepressants: In accordance with the protocol, subjects demonstrated nonresponse 
to at least 2 antidepressant treatments prior to randomization, nonresponse to at least 1 antidepressant 
was assessed prospectively during the screening/prospective observational phase. At the start of 
screening, as indicated in the MGH-ATRQ, nonresponse to 2 or more antidepressants was documented in 
89.7% of subjects, and for the remaining 10.3% of subjects, nonresponse had been documented for 1 
antidepressant. The number of nonresponses reported in the MGH-ATRQ was most commonly 2 prior oral 
antidepressants (for 52.8% of subjects), followed by 3 prior oral antidepressants (for 24.9% subjects).  
General classes of antidepressants: 
•  Number: The majority of subjects (60.5%) had demonstrated nonresponse to 2 classes of prior 
oral antidepressants. The remaining subjects were approximately evenly split, with 21.9% 
nonresponsive to <2 prior classes and 17.5% nonresponsive >2 prior classes. 
•  Class: The prior oral antidepressant classes that had failed most often during screening were 
SSRIs (to which 35.2% of subjects had demonstrated nonresponse), followed by SNRIs (for 
Assessment report

24.7% of subjects) and the "multiple" category (for 21.6% of subjects), which included subjects 
who were treated with more than 1 class of antidepressant. 
Duration: The treatment with prior oral antidepressant that was ongoing at screening had a mean (SD) 
duration of >1 year, at 425.2 (800.45) days. 
•  New oral antidepressants initiated at randomization: The class was more often an SNRI (for 
61.6% of subjects) than an SSRI (for 38.4% of subjects). The type was most often duloxetine (for 
45.5% of subjects); the other 3 types (escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine XR) each were 
prescribed to <20% of subjects.

With respect to subgroup analyses of efficacy results by age for adult population, for the 2 short-term 
studies of adults (i.e., for Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001), the Statistical Analysis Plan had prespecified 
that the efficacy results of MADRS total scores would be analyzed for the subpopulations of ages <45 
years and ≥45 years.  Efficacy results were generally consistent between these adult age subpopulations. 
In the pooled analyses, the mean difference in MADRS total scores at endpoint favoured treatment with 
esketamine + oral AD over treatment with oral AD + intranasal placebo for the older adults (ages 45 to 64 
years) and for the younger adults (ages 18 to 44 years), with a slightly larger estimated effect for the 
older adults. 
In the exploratory pooled analysis of Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001, forest plots were generated to show 
the least-squares mean treatment differences of change from baseline (95% CI) to Day 28 or endpoint for 
the same prespecified adult demographic variables as in the CSRs.  
In the pooled adult population of studies TRD3001 and TRD3002 no major differences in the results could 
be observed in the various subgroups. Only two subgroups in country and one in functional impairment 
functions did not favour esketamine + oral AD. 
Esketamine + oral AD was generally favoured over oral AD + intranasal placebo in the various 
demographic subpopulations in the pooled adult studies. Some exceptions occurred in subpopulations 
with numbers of subjects that were small; for example, for black race with 20 subjects in the esketamine 
group but 7 subjects in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group. Some exceptions were driven by results 
of one study but not the other; for example, for baseline functional impairment, esketamine was favoured 
in all 3 categories in Study TRD3001, and 2 categories (marked and extreme impairment) in Study 
TRD3002. Moreover, these potential exceptions in race and functional impairment in the short-term 
studies were not observed in the long-term study. 
For the prior oral antidepressants in the pooled studies TRD3002 and TRD3001, it is noted that a small 
percentage ~10% (9.7% for the esketamine + oral AD and 11.3% for oral AD + intranasal placebo) had 
only one treatment failure. The various analyses provided for the population selected to be included in the 
studies are further reassuring that these patients belonged to the TRD spectrum.  
With respect to the concomitant oral AD, it is observed that there were no major differences between 
esketamine + oral AD and for oral AD + intranasal placebo groups and percentages were similar with 
respect to the selected newly initiated oral AD between the two groups, with duloxetine being the most 
preferable choice (44.3% for esk+oral AD and 47.3% for oral AD+PL).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The evaluation of esketamine in an elderly population was important as TRD in this population is more 
severe and less responsive to treatment. Furthermore, treatment of depression in the elderly is 
challenging as patients not only commonly suffer from disability, functional decline, and diminished 
quality of life from TRD, but also as a consequence of comorbid medical conditions.

treatment-by-age group, and baseline value as a covariate. 
•  For both MMRM and ANCOVA analyses, a negative difference favors esketamine, and the results were not 
adjusted for sample size re-estimation. 
Notes: The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 points; a higher score indicates a more severe condition, and a 
negative change in score indicates improvement. The age categories apply to study entry.  
Sources: The data are adapted from the TEFMADSG02 table series presented in (or attached to) the sections about 
subgroup analyses in the Clinical Study Report (Mod5.3.5.1/TRD3005/Sec6.2.3.2 and Sec6.2.4.1). 
The results for the subgroup 65-74 years of age are supportive of the effect of esketamine as add-on   
therapy for TRD. However, the impact from the very elderly aged ≥ 75 years did not allow the primary 
endpoint results to reach statistical significance. The difference in the change of MADRS total score from 
Baseline to Day 28 MMRM, double induction phase, Full analysis set was -3.6 (-7.20; 0.07) with a 1-sided 
p-value=0.029 which was greater than the predefined 1-sided p-value of 0.025 [ANCOVA LOCF -3.6 
(-7.16; -0.03) 1-sided p-value=0.026]. In addition, as already pointed out by the Applicant, the number 
of patients for 75 years and older is very small (n=17) to draw any conclusions.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The initially proposed indication for this application was: 
•  Spravato is indicated for treatment-resistant depression (Major Depressive Disorder in adults 
who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants in the current 
moderate to severe depressive episode).

The data submitted from phase 2 and phase 3 studies could not support such a broad indication, since 
esketamine has been administered only as an add-on therapy, concomitantly with a SSRI or SNRI.  
The Applicant agreed to modify the proposed indication for SPRAVATO to better describe the patient 
population evaluated in the clinical development program: 
•  SPRAVATO, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with 
treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different 
treatments with antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode. 
The latest proposed indication was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Clinical Development program 
The current European Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
depression (EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2 previously, London 30 May 2013) outlines the clinical 
requirements for the development of a medicinal product for the treatment of major depressive disorder. 
The minimum requirements according to this guideline are short term randomised, double-blind, parallel 
group, placebo controlled studies for demonstration of the antidepressant effect and a relapse prevention 
study for the demonstration of the maintenance of effect for at least 6 months. For the latter a 
randomised withdrawal study, allowing to study relapse prevention is probably the best design. 
Prevention of the next episode(s) or recurrence prevention is not a mandatory part of a registration 
package for treatment of MDD episodes. The requirement for additional long term data beyond 6 months 
can be fulfilled post approval. For treatment-resistant depression at least one failure to previous 
treatments should be demonstrated prospectively. 
The Applicant has received scientific advice for its development program from EMA, FDA and National 
Authorities.  
The Applicant performed a clinical program which consisted of data from four phase 2 studies and 
five completed Phase 3 studies investigating efficacy and safety of esketamine as an adjunctive treatment 
together with a newly initiated oral AD for the treatment of adults with TRD, including those 65 years and 
older.  
In order to support the short term antidepressant effect, the Applicant has performed two short term 
(4-week) double blind randomised parallel group phase 3 studies comparing esketamine plus a newly 
initiated oral antidepressant with a newly initiated oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo. For the 
maintenance of effect a double blind active controlled relapse prevention study was conducted. In 
addition, a double blind active controlled study in elderly and very elderly and an open label long term 
safety and efficacy study, without a comparator have been submitted.  
As such the clinical development program can be considered as comprehensive and conforming to the 
requirements of the EU Guideline.  
However, the objectives of the studies to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of esketamine in the 
treatment of TRD can be misinterpreted, since the data submitted only support the adjunctive use of 
esketamine as add-on therapy administered concomitantly with a newly initiated oral AD for the 
treatment of TRD. The phase 3 clinical program does not include data from the use of esketamine as 
monotherapy in the treatment of TRD. In the dose response phase 2 study TRD2003, although the 
presentation of the study and its results was focused on a comparison of various groups taking different 
doses of esketamine versus placebo, concomitant medication with other antidepressants was also 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 119/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
allowed. Hence, the administration of esketamine in this phase 2 study TRD2003 was in an adjunctive 
setting, as in the case of the phase 3 studies.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With respect to the design of the studies, several points can be considered innovative compared to the 
studies performed up to now in the field of depression. It should be noted that the field of major 
depressive disorder and its treatment is a dynamic field with several interesting discussions taking place 
in various fora.  
First of all, the clinical program of intranasal esketamine is aiming for the indication of treatment-resistant 
depression when no other product has been approved in this indication in Europe [the combination of 
olanzapine-fluoxetine (Symbyax) has been approved only in USA]. 
Secondly, it was considered important to show that the population included in the studies belonged to the 
treatment-resistant depressed patients according to the definitions of contemporary guidelines. 
According to the current EU Guideline on depression, patients who have not responded to at least 2 
different AD treatments, at an adequate dose for an adequate duration, in the current depressive episode 
are considered to have TRD. The intended target population for the proposed therapeutic indication 
should be suffering from treatment-resistant depression. As such it was attempted to make clear that the 
study participants belong to this patient group and had certain characteristics with special focus on 
treatment failures. To this purpose, the Applicant has used the conservative definition of 
Treatment-resistant depression with at least two treatment failures and made a considerable effort to 
recruit treatment-resistant depressed patients in line with recommendations of the current EU Depression 
Guideline. Eligibilty criteria demanded both retrospective assessment of prior AD nonresponse and 
prospective assessment of AD nonresponse. However, it should be noted that the EU Depression 
Guideline is currently under revision and these discussions, especially those which reflect a less restrictive 
approach for the definition of TRD, could be taken on board.  
It is noted that a high percentage of patients in the short term studies (~89.4% and 89.5% in TRD3001 
and ~92.1% in TRD3002 in the Esketamine + Oral AD group) had treatment failures with 2 or more 
specific antidepressant medications and a high percentage (~74% and 78% in TRD3001 and ~80% in 
TRD3002 in the Esketamine + Oral AD group) had treatment failures with 2 or more classes of 
antidepressant medications. For the prior oral antidepressants in the pooled studies TRD3002 and 
TRD3001, it is noted that a small percentage ~10% (9.7% for the esketamine + oral AD and 11.3% for 
oral AD + intranasal placebo) had only one treatment failure. For the esketamine + oral AD group 
(N=343) 53.7% had 2 treatment failures, 25.2% had 3 treatment failures, 8.5% had 4 treatment failures 
and 2.9% had 5 treatment failures or more. The various analyses provided for the population selected to 
be included in the studies are further reassuring that these patients belonged to the TRD spectrum. 
The amendments in studies TRD3001 and TRD3002 revising the inclusion criteria to change the required 
number of antidepressant treatment failures could have had an impact on the patient population. 
However, the definition for TRD resistant depression is being discussed for quite some time among 
experts in the field. It should also be noted that nonresponse to at least 1 antidepressant was assessed 
prospectively during the screening/prospective observational phase. It could be argued that 1 treatment 
failure assessed prospectively can be considered sufficient to define a treatment-resistant depressed 
patient, since TRD develops in a continuum with progressively higher resistance depending on the 
number and nature of interventions failed. Taking this under consideration the amendments for the 
demonstration of non-response in TRD3001 and TRD3002 are not expected to have influenced the target 
population. It can hence be considered that the population studied with esketamine belonged in the 
treatment-resistant depressed patients’ spectrum.

With respect to the amendment 4 in study TRD3003, changing the definitions of stable remission and 
stable response, it is acknowledged that a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to determine 
whether the change in definition changed the result. Of the 176 stable remitters, 167 subjects met the 
stable remission definition per pre-Amendment 4, 8 subjects met the definition in Amendment 4 (2 with 
missing MADRS at Week 13, 6 with one excursion of a MADRS >12 at Week 13 or 14), and 1 stable 
responder was incorrectly randomized as a stable remitter. It is considered that amendment 4 in the 
protocol of TRD3003 did not affect the conclusions of the study. In addition to the subgroup analysis of 
pre/post Amendment 4, the Cox proportional hazards model and unweighted log-rank test was performed 
post-hoc on the 167 subjects who met the more stringent definition per pre-Amendment 4 to evaluate the 
robustness of the results. The HR (95% CI) for the 167 subjects was 0.44 (0.26; 0.74) with a 2-sided 
p-value of 0.002. It is considered that amendment 4 in the protocol of TRD3003 did not affect the 
outcome of the study.  
As mentioned above, the requirement of prospectively demonstrating a treatment failure in depression 
was fulfilled by the Applicant during a screening/prospective observational phase. Following this 
screening phase the third innovative key feature in the design of the short term DB studies was the 
initiation of a new oral antidepressant. The newly initiated oral antidepressant was restricted to four 
agents: escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine and venlafaxine extended release. The newly initiated 
antidepressant can be justified from the ethical point that patients with TRD should not be left without any 
treatment during the studies, as well as from the contemporary clinical practice which dictates that after 
4 weeks prospective observation with one antidepressant these patients cannot continue receiving the 
same AD that did not show response and improvement in their condition.  
Another key design feature in the short term DB phase 3 studies was the flexible dosing. The amount of 
esketamine and the dosing frequency used in the phase 3 trials is supported by data from the phase 2 
studies. The use of a flexible dosing scheme is considered part of the everyday clinical practice, with which 
the depressed patient is being evaluated by the physician for its response and tolerability to treatment 
and modifications to the treatment are expected to occur. It is not considered uncommon to increase the 
amount of antidepressants or decrease them to the minimum effective dose or modify the dosing 
frequency in order to achieve the best possible effect for the patient.  The flexibility in the dosing regimen 
is within the general approach for treatment of depression depending on the observed efficacy and the 
undesirable effects. In addition, the population studied in the clinical program of esketamine is considered 
to be moderate to severe depressed patients since they are suffering from treatment-resistant depression 
and have already experienced treatment failures with antidepressants. The setting for esketamine 
administration is as add-on therapy. These factors contribute to the recommendation of a flexible dosing 
scheme based on efficacy and tolerability and the Applicant has provided adequate data from phase 2 and 
phase 3 studies supporting such a flexible dosing scheme. 
The  design  of  the  elderly  study  (TRD3005)  was  comparable  to  the  adult  study  TRD3002  with  flexible 
dosing, apart from adding a 28 mg esketamine dose in the elderly study. Introducing the lower dose of 28 
mg  as  a  cautionary  approach  is  endorsed  due  to  the  immediate  adverse  events  of  esketamine  i.e. 
dissociation and blood pressure increase, which may be more detrimental in the elderly. However, there 
is no clear dose-response relationship with respect to adverse events. The available PK data indicates that 
exposure is larger in elderly as compared to younger adults. 
Apart from these key design features the remaining parts of the design of the clinical studies were in 
accordance with contemporary guidelines and clinical practice. There are, however, some comments for 
the statistical methods and analysis of the results and clarifications are requested. 
Due to the absence of data, extrapolation to other oral ADs apart from SSRIs and SNRIs, which were used 
in the clinical trials, is not possible. 
Study participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 121/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The subjects were 67.1% women and 32.9% men; were white in 83.2% of cases; were enrolled in North 
America for 43.2% of subjects, in Europe for 38.8% of subjects, and in Central or South America for 
18.1% of subjects; and had a mean (SD) age of 46.1 (11.46) years. Population from EU was sufficiently 
represented in the studies (conforming to CHMP Scientific Advice). The Applicant also attempted to fulfil 
the commitment to CHMP to include as many subjects ≥75 years of age as possible to evaluate efficacy in 
an elderly population in the study TRD3005 (please see also section on outcomes).  
The number of patients included in the studies is considered sufficient.  
In studies TRD3001, TRD3003 and TRD3005 there were subjects with protocol deviations regarding data 
related to previous non-response to antidepressant treatment. None of these subjects were withdrawn 
from the study in contrast to study TRD3002. The Applicant presented a per protocol analysis excluding 
patient with major protocol deviations for the studies 3001, 3002, 3003 and 3005 and the results of these 
analyses are consistent with the conclusions from the primary endpoint analysis. 
Endpoints 
The selection of the endpoints and the measurement of MADRS change from baseline to endpoint (after 
4 weeks in double-blind induction phase) is considered appropriate and in accordance with the current 
treatment and development guidelines, literature and clinical practice. The duration of 4 weeks is within 
the recommendations of the EU Depression Guideline. The randomised withdrawal design to evaluate 
relapse prevention is also according to the current EU Depression Guideline. The long term study was not 
aiming to investigate recurrence prevention of the next episode, but this is not mandatory for marketing 
authorisation. The efficacy data collected together with the safety data in this open-label long term study 
have provided useful supportive information.  
The  endpoints  (primary  and  secondary)  used  for  the  evaluation  of  efficacy  of  esketamine  in  TRD  (as 
adjunctive  treatment)  are  considered  reliable,  validated,  referenced  in  treatment  and  development 
guidelines and used throughout many years in the clinical practice and hence appropriate. 
The Applicant confirmed that efficacy evaluations were performed prior to administration of intranasal 
study medication (esketamine or placebo) at each study visit 
Sample size 
Sample size re-calculations and interim analysis as well as implementation of several measures to protect 
the integrity of the study, are considered acceptable. 
Randomisation was considered appropriate. 
Blinding 
With respect to blinding, the use of independent remote (by phone) blinded raters is considered 
appropriate. The use of a bittering agent in the intranasal placebo and the use of 3 devices (for doses up 
to 84mg) in each treatment session were additional precautionary measures to ensure that blinding was 
maintained. For study TRD3003, despite the fact that patients who were used to the effects of esketamine 
were re-randomised, post-hoc analyses and assessment did not reveal any major concerns. 
MADRS assessment was performed by a blinded remote rater due to clear acute but transient (adverse) 
effects of esketamine, which may have made the investigator aware of the treatment assignment, which 
is accepted. However, considering these effects it is presumed that many patients on esketamine could 
correctly guess whether they were on the active treatment arm and the score by the blinded evaluator is 
based on the interview with the patient.   The dissociative effects of esketamine leading to unblinding 
probably had an effect on the effect size, however not to a significant extent. It is also acknowledged that 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 122/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a higher than expected response in the oral AD + intranasal placebo arm is an opposite effect than is 
expected in case of unblinding. 
Baseline values 
No major imbalances that could affect the outcome of the studies have been observed in the baseline data 
between the esketamine plus oral antidepressant group and the oral antidepressant plus nasal placebo 
group. 
Statistical methods  
For the short-term induction studies, the target of estimation (estimand) according to the Applicant was 
the hypothetical treatment effect when the drug was taken as intended in the protocol. However, the 
treatment effect that is of primary interest from a regulatory point of view is the effect regardless of 
treatment discontinuations, and if patients changing treatment to an alternative AD therapy had simply 
discontinued corresponding treatment(s) instead. Actually, it is somewhat unclear what treatment effect 
is targeted by the primary analysis ANCOVA (LOCF). Furthermore, handling of missing data by LOCF is 
considered problematic as it assumes patients will not deteriorate when they have missing data after 
treatment failure and loss to follow up. This is a strong assumption, and the analyses based on this are 
likely overoptimistic. However, ANCOVA (BOCF) that was provided as sensitivity analysis, which was 
already recommended in the CHMP scientific advice as a possibility for missing data imputation, could be 
considered as a conservative analysis in accordance with the target of estimation of primary regulatory 
interest because BOCF assumes that all benefits potentially achieved from treatment are lost. 
Different statistical methods were used for EU (ANCOVA (LOCF)) and non-EU countries (MMRM), which is 
acceptable. Interim analysis with sample size re-calculation were performed for studies 3001 and 3005. 
Adequate procedures to ensure confidentiality of interim results and integrity of the study were 
implemented. The interim analysis was appropriately taken into account in the statistical analysis.  
In the relapse prevention study, the target of estimation (estimand) according to the Applicant was the 
effect ‘while on initially randomised treatment’. However, this is not the treatment effect of primary 
interest for assessment of maintenance of effect from a regulatory point of view because this effect is only 
related to the subset of the population that is on treatment, which changes with time because of 
treatment drop-outs. The treatment effect that is actually of primary interest is the effect regardless of 
treatment discontinuations and if patients changing treatment to an alternative AD therapy had simply 
discontinued corresponding treatment(s) instead. However, as the proportion of patients who 
discontinued treatment during the maintenance phase was relatively small (~10%), the strategy how 
intercurrent events are addressed is not of critical importance for the conclusions from the study. 
Furthermore, the pre-sensitivity analysis which was originally intended to serve another purpose can also 
be considered as sensitivity analysis for the effect of primary regulatory interest. 
The two- stage design with sample size estimation at interim was adequately taken into account for 
statistical testing by using the weighted log-rank statistic and for estimation by a method proposed by 
Wassmer. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
 As already pointed out, monotherapy data comparing esketamine alone versus placebo or active 
comparator have not been collected in phase 3 studies.

Short term DB phase 3 studies in adults 
In Study TRD3002, a statistically significant effect for esketamine (56 or 84 mg) + oral AD was obtained, 
where the estimated difference (95% CI) compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo treatment was -4.0 
(-7.31; -0.64) points by MMRM, -3.5 (-6.67; -0.26) points by ANCOVA LOCF and -3.5 (-6.70; -0.27) by 
ANCOVA BOCF analysis methods. In this study, which is considered pivotal, and a specific study site did 
not dominate the results.  
In Study TRD3001, the treatment effect (difference in MADRS change form baseline to Day 28) for 
esketamine 84mg + oral AD group compared with oral AD + intranasal placebo was not statistically 
significant at the 2-sided 0.05 level. As a result, the treatment effect for esketamine 56mg + oral AD 
group compared with oral AD + intranasal placebo could not be formally tested. The estimated differences 
(95% CI) for the 56 mg dose were -4.1 (-7.67; -0.49) (p=0.027) points by MMRM, -4.1 (-7.53; -0.60) 
(p=0.022) by ANCOVA LOCF and -4.3 (-7.79; -0.80) (p=0.017) by ANCOVA BOCF analysis methods. In 
the case of the 84 mg dose the estimated differences were: -3.2 (-6.88; +0.45) (p=0.088) points by 
MMRM, -2.0 (-5.52; +1.42) (p=0.250) points by ANCOVA LOCF and -1.2 (-4.66; +2.32) (p=0.513) by 
ANCOVA BOCF analysis methods. However, the results for 56 mg cannot be formally evaluated and the 
p-value should not be referenced. 
Despite the fact that the results in study TRD3001 were statistically non-significant (BOCF analysis for the 
84mg fixed dose, p-value=0.513), a very consistent treatment effect (-4.1 and -4.3) favouring 
esketamine +oral AD was observed for the 56 mg fixed dose across various analysis methods. In contrast 
a variable treatment effect (from -1.2 to -3.2) was observed for the 84 mg fixed dose. The same 
magnitude of treatment effect that was observed for the 56 mg dose in study TRD3001 (difference of 
change in MADRS using BOCF analysis: -4.3) was also recorded in study TRD3002 (difference of change 
in MADRS using BOCF analysis: -3.5).  
The effect size of -3.5 or -4.3, which was observed in the esketamine short term DB studies, is considered 
clinically relevant, since a difference of 2 between the test and the reference treatment or placebo has 
been previously considered sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the regulatory setting for monotherapy. 
However, in a number of publications provided by the Applicant there was a range in the treatment effect 
sizes for MADRS total score reported in individual published studies of approved antidepressant drugs 
either as monotherapy or add-on treatment, i.e. the MADRS difference of treatment from placebo was for 
quetiapine (add-on) from -1.19 to -3.05, aripiprazole (add-on) from -2.80 to -3.70, for brexpiprazole 
(add-on) from -1.19 to -3.12 and for vortioxetine from -0.5 to -7.1. Hence, the treatment effect observed 
with esketamine in TRD population is considered clinically relevant and meaningful. 
In studies 3001 and 3005 with interim analysis, larger treatment effects were observed after interim 
analysis. Regarding a potential concern on confidentiality of interim results, it is reassuring that study 
3002 without interim analysis showed a larger treatment group difference for subjects who were enrolled 
later in the analysis mimicking a by stage evaluation, which was performed with setting cut-off for stage 
1 according to the same rules as for studies 3001 and 3005 (although it is noted that the difference 
between stage 1 and stage 2 was smaller than for studies 3001 and 3005). However, the consistent 
finding of a larger treatment effect for subjects who were enrolled later in three studies, which may be 
explained by changes in study conduct, raises concerns on a heterogeneous treatment effect. However, 
as there were only slight differences in patient characteristics between stage 1 and stage 2, it cannot be 
concluded that there is a difference in patient populations between stage 1 and 2. Therefore a patient 
population in which esketamine on top of an oral AD would have a greater efficacy cannot be defined and 
it is considered that the observed effect estimates in the short-term studies can be generalized to the 
target patient population. 
The  Applicant  is  also  requested  to  clarify  the  most  common  reasons  for  screening  failures,  to  give 
perspective in the difficulty of identifying TRD population and the possibility of including patients without 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019

treatment resistance in the study, taking into account the higher than expected response in the control 
arm, as presented later. The Applicant described the specific reasons for withdrawal by subject (Studies 
TRD3001/3002/3005). The most common reason was inability to follow the study visit schedule. 
It should be noted however, that similar effect sizes to those observed in the short term DB phase 3 
studies have been also observed in the phase 2 clinical studies for esketamine indicating a consistency of 
the antidepressant effect. 
MMRM was primary analysis only for non-EU countries; for EU, ANCOVA (LOCF) was primary. ANCOVA 
(BOCF) is considered the most relevant method of analysis which is presented in the SmPC.  
Besides the differences observed in the change of MADRS from baseline to day28/endpoint between 
esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo, responder and remitter rates are also important 
to demonstrate efficacy in depression.  In study TRD3001, the response and remission rates at Day 28 in 
the esketamine + oral AD groups were 54.1% and 36.0% (for the esketamine 56-mg group), 53.1% and 
38.8% (for the esketamine 84-mg group) and were 38.9% and 30.6% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo 
group. In study TRD3002 the response and remission rates at Day 28 were 69.3% and 52.5% of the 
esketamine + oral AD group and 52.0% and 31.0% of the oral AD + intranasal placebo. The differences 
in response and remission rates can be considered at least comparable or even higher than those 
previously observed in studies with approved antidepressants. The statement by the Applicant that “a 
treatment difference of the magnitude observed in the end point (DB LOCF) response rates between 
esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo in the Phase 3 short-term studies (i.e., 11% to 
16%) has been considered clinically meaningful for approval of other Ads” is considered valid. 
In the esketamine + oral AD groups, remission rates (MADRS total score ≤12) at end point (DB LOCF) 
among adult subjects were 48.2% in TRD3002 and 34.8% and 35.4% in the 56 mg and 84 mg dose 
groups of TRD3001 (vs 30.3% and 29.2% for oral AD + intranasal placebo groups of both studies), and 
were 15.5% in the elderly population in TRD3005 (vs 6.3% in elderly oral AD + intranasal placebo group). 
In the pooled adult population of studies TRD3001 and TRD3002 no major differences in the results could 
be observed in the various subgroups. Only two subgroups in country and one in functional impairment 
functions did not favour esketamine + oral AD. Analyses has been provided for efficacy in select 
subpopulations using data pooled for adults in Studies TRD3002 and TRD3001. These analyses of pooled 
data were performed to increase the precision of efficacy estimates in adult subpopulations. 
With respect to the higher than expected response for oral AD +placebo in the TRD3002 and TRD3001 
studies, this can be attributed to the initiation of a new oral AD, the increased interaction with healthcare 
professionals, the novelty with the nasal administration and the expectation for benefit by the patients. 
The argumentation provided by the Applicant on this issue is considered valid, reflecting the current 
situation in the major depressive disorder field. The Applicant provided an analysis with the number of 
previous treatment failures in the patients who showed response in studies TRD3002 and TRD3001 and 
belonged to the oral AD+ intranasal placebo group.  In TRD3001, the majority of oral AD + intranasal 
placebo responder subjects at endpoint had 2 failures (57.1%), followed by 3 (28.6%), and ≥4 (14.3%). 
In TRD3002, the majority of oral AD + intranasal placebo responder at endpoint subjects had 2 failures 
(77.8%), followed by 3 (11.1%), and ≥4 (11.1%). 
Based on these results, a statistically significant and clinically relevant antidepressant effect of 
esketamine as adjunctive treatment in TRD has been demonstrated in at least one short term 
randomised, controlled, double blind study and is supported by trends favouring esketamine + oral AD in 
two more short term DB studies.  
Secondary endpoints

Three prespecified key secondary endpoints for study TRD3002 were tested in the following sequence: 
onset of clinical response by Day 2 (24 hours), change in SDS total score, and change in PHQ-9 total 
score. It would have been a clearer demonstration of efficacy if the hierarchical testing showed results in 
the prespecified prioritised way for the most important key secondary efficacy endpoint followed by the 
next two. Since the onset of clinical response by Day 2 in TRD3002 (2-sided p=0.321) was not statistically 
significant, the results for the other two key secondary efficacy endpoints cannot be used in a 
confirmatory way. Similarly, in the case of TRD3001, since the primary endpoint for esketamine 
84mg+oral AD was not statistically significant (2-sided p=0.513), consequently, the primary endpoint for 
esketamine 56mg as well as the key secondary endpoints could not provide confirmation. However, the 
results from the key secondary endpoints in both studies cannot be disregarded and they did show a trend 
favouring esketamine + oral AD versus oral AD + intranasal placebo. The other secondary endpoints 
(changes in CGI-S, EQ-VAS and GAD-7 scores) also showed a trend in favour of esketamine + oral AD 
versus oral AD+ intranasal placebo, further supporting the antidepressant primary efficacy results. 
The nominal p-value suggests separation from oral AD + intranasal placebo in SDS and PHQ-9. As in 
study TRD3001, the numerical improvement in SDS as well as PHQ-9 can be considered large. At Day 28, 
the RR vs. control is higher for remission as compared to response, while in study TRD3001 the opposite 
was seen, which is more of the expected pattern. The Applicant calculated the relative risks for response 
and remission and to discuss the observations. It is acknowledged that the RR vs. control for response 
was  comparable in  studies  TRD3001  and  TRD3002  and  the  difference  in  remission  rates  between  the 
studies is noted.  
It should be noted that for the onset of clinical response at Day 2 (24 hours) in TRD3001 showed higher 
numerical values for esketamine 56mg  + oral AD (10.4%, 1-sided p=0.010) and esketamine 84mg + 
oral AD (8.8%, 1-sided p=0.041>p=0.025) vs oral AD + intranasal placebo (1.8%). Similarly, in 
TRD3002 the percentage that showed onset of clinical response by Day 2 (24 hours) was 7.9% for 
esketamine + oral AD and 4.6% for oral AD + intranasal placebo (p=0.321). Despite the fact that 
statistical significance was not achieved, it is obvious that a rapid onset of effect by Day 2 for esketamine 
+ oral AD was observed in both double blind phase 3 studies TRD3001 and TD3002.   
However, it is also noted that there is a considerable change in MADRS total score from Day 0 (BL) to Day 
2 (24hrs) (please see below Table with results from TRD3002 from TEFMAD03A: Montgomery-Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score: Means and Mean Changes From Baseline Over Time; 
Double-blind Induction Phase (Study ESKETINTRD3002: Full Analysis Set). Furthermore, this decrease 
does not follow the same rate of decline between Day 2 (24hrs) and Day 8. From day 8 onwards MADRS 
total score continue to decline considerably (Figure 6a with Least-squares Mean Changes (±SE) Over 
Time by ANCOVA LOCF for the Double-blind Induction Phases in Studies TRD3002, TRD3001). The 
Applicant discussed this “plateau” phase in the change of MADRS total score between Day 2 (24hrs) and 
Day 8, which was probably due to the overlapping recall periods of these 2 assessments.  
For the first time it is noticed that efficacy starts earlier with a medicinal product in comparison to already 
approved conventional ADs (which usually requires a start of the effect at 2 weeks). This can be 
considered an important advantage, although a claim cannot be made due to the lack of statistical 
significance and a direct comparison. 
Subgroup analyses were supportive of the results for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
For the 3 short-term studies, the subpopulations of the 223 subjects in Study TRD3002, the 342 subjects 
in Study TRD3001, and the 137 subjects in Study TRD3005 were compared for the primary efficacy 
outcomes. Efficacy results were generally consistent in favouring esketamine for both younger adult 
subjects (ages 18 to 44 years) and older adult subjects (aged 45 to 64 years). Comparisons for patients 
>75 years of age could not be meaningful due to the small sample size of this age group.

Study in elderly and very elderly patients TRD3005 
In TRD3005, similarly to the studies TRD3001 and TD3002, the estimated treatment difference (95% CI) 
of -3.6 (-7.20; +0.07) by MMRM and -3.6 (-7.16; -0.03) by ANCOVA LOCF analysis methods for 
esketamine + oral AD over oral AD + intranasal placebo suggests a clinically meaningful benefit, without 
reaching statistical significance (LOCF 1-sided p=0.026) due to the outcome in the very elderly patients 
≥75 years of age (+1.3 difference in the change of MADRSThe results for study TRD3005 were analysed 
by ANCOVA BOCF.   
Baseline scores indicate that, on average, patients had severe depression with long duration (over 20 
years) in most cases. Data regarding the number of classes of antidepressants with prior non-response 
was similar to younger adults. 
The results for the subgroup 65-74 years of age are supportive of the effect of esketamine as add-on   
therapy for TRD. However, the outcome for the very elderly aged ≥ 75 years had an impact which did not 
allow the primary endpoint results to reach statistical significance. The difference in the change of MADRS 
total score from Baseline to Day 28 MMRM, double induction phase, Full analysis set was -3.6 (-7.20; 
0.07) with a 1-sided p-value=0.029, which was greater than the predefined 1-sided p-value of 0.025 
[ANCOVA LOCF -3.6 (-7.16; -0.03) 1-sided p-value=0.026]. In addition, as already pointed out by the 
Applicant, the number of patients for 75 years and older is very small (n=17) to draw any conclusions.  it 
is acknowledged that the obtained MADRS effect size and the effect sizes of CGI-S, PHQ-9, and SDS 
scales in the elderly study are consistent with the adult studies, and add-on treatment with esketamine 
may provide an additional benefit to elderly patients with TRD. It is considered appropriate that the 
decision to continue or stop treatment, based on the individual status of the patient regarding efficacy and 
safety, is left to the discretion of the prescriber. 
The same clear difference between the stages in observed treatment difference between esketamine and 
the control group as in the adult studies is seen in the elderly study. The protocol amendments introduced 
during the study modified the inclusion criteria for  example with respect to non-response to previous 
treatment.  Based on the slight differences in baseline psychiatric history it cannot be concluded that 
there is a difference in patient populations between stage 1 and 2. 
Relapse prevention study TRD3003 
As already mentioned above, a relapse prevention study is required for a MAA in order to demonstrate the 
maintenance of the antidepressant effect. Study TRD3003 served as a relapse prevention study with 
statistically significant results in favour of esketamine + oral AD. The results showed a statistically 
significantly longer time to relapse in patients randomized to continue esketamine compared with those 
randomized to discontinue esketamine. This was also true for those patients who were in stable remission 
after 16 weeks of treatment with esketamine + oral AD (2-sided p=0.003). The secondary efficacy results 
for the time to relapse by stable responders (but who were not in remission) showed a statistically 
significantly longer time to relapse in subjects randomized to continue esketamine compared to those 
randomized to discontinue esketamine (2-sided p<0.001). Overall, 24 (26.7%) subjects in the intranasal 
esketamine + oral antidepressant group and 39 (45.3%) subjects in the oral antidepressant + intranasal 
placebo group experienced a relapse event during the maintenance phase. Due to non-proportional 
hazards, relapse proportion differences at fixed time points provide a better description of the treatment 
effect than hazard ratio. After 12 weeks, the relapse proportions (Kaplan-Meier estimates) were 13% in 
the esketamine + oral AD arm and 37% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo arm, corresponding to a 
difference of −24.0% (95% CI: −35.2%; −10.7%). After 24 weeks, the relapse proportions were 32% in 
the esketamine + oral AD arm and 46% in the oral AD + intranasal placebo arm, corresponding to a 
difference of −14.0% (95% CI: −28.1%; 2.7%). Subgroup analyses and secondary efficacy endpoints 
were supportive of the results of the primary and key secondary endpoints.

Certain points in the short term DB phase 3 studies and the relapse prevention study were clarified i.e.: 
- details on 14 subjects relapsed during the optimization phase were provided 
- Dosing frequency allocation during the maintenance phase was based on a  MADRS algorithm which 
allowed patients to switch frequency up to 3 times during the maintenance phase. This resulted in a rather 
complex  overall  administration  of  esketamine.  Patients  could  switch  back  and  forth  between  dosing 
frequency.  For  the  purpose  of  further  examination  of  efficacy  between  dosing  frequencies,  some 
additional analyses was requested and provided and no apparent differences between the subpopulations 
were identified.  
- The majority of the subjects who relapsed during the first month after discontinuation of esketamine 
were subjects who required a weekly dosing frequency to sustain remission. For a comparison of patient 
characteristics  between  the  subpopulations,  the  Applicant  provided  a  comparison  of  demographic 
characteristics  and  psychiatric  history  in  these  subpopulations  (i.e.  weekly  vs.  once  in  two  weeks 
administration).  
- It is considered that due to transient effects that esketamine has, patients switched from esketamine to 
placebo  in  the  re-randomization  could  have  perceived  that  they  no  longer  received  esketamine.  The 
Applicant’s analysis regarding dissociation and sedation pre-post randomization is appreciated, however 
it  is  questioned  whether  assessment  of  these  two  aspects  can  capture  all  symptoms  which  patients 
associate with esketamine. The Applicant has no other means to examine the impact of transient effects 
of esketamine on unblinding than the CADSS and MOAA/S scores. Unfortunately, there are no data on 
whether patients were indeed correctly aware of their assigned treatment.   
- Other key secondary endpoints included change from baseline (of maintenance phase) to endpoint in 
MADRS, PHQ-9, CGI-S, GAD-7, SDS and EQ-5D-5L.  For these endpoints the change from baseline was 
calculated to endpoint, which could be the maximum of the date of last visit in the maintenance phase, 
date  of  completion  of  the  maintenance  phase  due  to  relapse  or  study  termination,  or  date  of  early 
withdrawal  in  the  maintenance  phase.  Observation  time  differs  by  patient  and  could  be  defined  by 
relapse;  therefore,  it  is  questioned  whether  any  conclusions  can  be  drawn  based  on  these  data.  It  is 
acknowledged  that  the  collected  data  on  supporting  endpoints  could  provide  valuable  insight  in  the 
patient’s wellbeing on an individual level. On a group level the data however is difficult to interpret due to 
differences  of  follow-up  time  and  possible  relapse.  The  data  on  these  secondary  endpoint  are  not 
presented in the SmPC, which is endorsed in view of the uncertainties mentioned above. 
OL long term safety study TRD3004 
It appears that there were improvements in measurements of depression in the induction phase, which 
were consistent across multiple assessments of depressive symptoms over the 4-week induction phase 
and these improvements appeared to be maintained in subjects who continued treatment up to the 
1-year exposure. The graph presentation analysis for the 150 subjects who completed the 
optimisation/maintenance phase from the baseline of the induction phase was similar and consistent with 
the overall study results.  
The  study  included  both  direct-entry  subjects  and  patients  from  the  elderly  study  TRD3005. 
Non-responders from study TRD3005 could enter the induction phase of this study. The applicant has 
clarified  that  this  was  done  to  allow  patients  on  the  oral  AD  +  intranasal  placebo  the  opportunity  for 
treatment benefit with esketamine add-on treatment or allow patients on the oral AD + esketamine to 
gain further benefit from longer induction phase.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, although statistical significant results were only obtained in one of the short term 
randomised DB study (TRD3002), clear favourable trends were observed in the two other short-term 
studies (TRD3001, TRD3005) with the effect size being of similar magnitude. Taken together, the results 
demonstrate the antidepressant efficacy of esketamine vs. placebo, both on top of an oral antidepressant, 
in an appropriately defined treatment-resistant population. The results of the key secondary endpoints 
were supportive of those of the primary endpoint, i.e. change in MADRS. In study TRD3001, the 
hierarchical testing sequence did not formally allow testing for all the endpoints since the primary 
endpoint was non-significant. In study TRD3005 in patients over 65 years of age, the treatment response 
in the very elderly (≥75 years) patients did not allow any meaningful conclusions. The requirement to 
demonstrate maintenance of the antidepressant effect was achieved via a relapse prevention study of 
adequate duration (TRD3003). Furthermore, supportive efficacy data were generated in an open-label 
long term mainly safety study (TRD3004). Overall, the clinical program can be considered comprehensive 
and supports the use of esketamine as an adjunctive treatment administered concomitantly with a newly 
initiated oral SSRI or SNRI. The clinical program and the data submitted could not support a broad TRD 
indication since pivotal data on esketamine monotherapy are not available. Treatment with intranasal 
esketamine should be initiated by a psychiatrist.  
The following latest proposal from the Applicant best reflects the patient population studied and can be 
considered acceptable: 
•  SPRAVATO, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant 
Major Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with 
antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode (see section 5.1). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The experience with the use of the active substance is broad, given the fact that esketamine, the 
S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a well-known active substance already approved as solution for 
injection in induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in some EU countries. The racemic ketamine has 
been in widespread use worldwide for the same indications since the 1970s and is on the World Health 
Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.  
The presented clinical development program aimed at collecting sufficient information on the safety 
profile of nasal esketamine spray in the target population with TRD over the intended therapeutic dose 
range of 56 to 84 mg up to twice applications weekly. Achieved plasma levels are below those required for 
induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.  
In Phase 3 trials esketamine treatment was initiated concomitantly with a new oral antidepressant. 
Patient exposure 
Safety data have been derived from a total of 25 completed clinical studies (Phases 1 to 3) with additional 
limited data coming from 4 ongoing trials. As of the clinical cutoff date of 4 March 2018, 1861 unique 
patients were treated with esketamine corresponding to 1045 patient-years of exposure and 486 unique 
patients  were  treated  with  oral  AD  +  intranasal  placebo  corresponding  to  100  patient-years  of 
exposure.The primary safety assessment was based on a total of 1,708 patients with TRD, who received 
at least 1 dose of esketamine in six completed Phase 2 and 3 studies (TRD 3001, TRD 3002, TRD 3005, 
TRD  3003,  TRD  3003,  TRD  2003)  with  a  combined  cumulative  exposure  to  esketamine  of 
611 patient-years  and  108 patient-years  to  placebo.  Five  of  the  six  studies  were  completed  Phase  3

studies with 479 subjects exposed to esketamine for at least 6 months and 178 for at least 12 months (in 
total 1,601 subjects included in Phase 3). 
Supportive data was derived from the Phase 1 trials as well as from ongoing Phase 2 and 3 trials and one 
completed Phase 2 trial in subjects with MDSI.

Most patients received the 28 mg or 56 mg dose only for a few dosing days (≤ 8), while patients receiving 
the higher dose of 84 mg were more frequently treated for more dosing days, as outlined in the table 
below.

Most of the subjects receiving esketamine + oral AD experienced one or more TEAEs, which were judged 
to be possibly related to the intranasal drug at a high rate. The frequency of TEAEs was lower in the 
placebo + oral AD groups.

long-term extension study TRD3008. 
Most TEAEs were reported post-dose on the day of dosing and resolved the same day. A large number of 
TEAEs (psychiatric, gastro-intestinal or cardiovascular disorders) are in accordance with ADRs already 
known  for  the  active  substance  or  can  be  derived  from  its  anaesthetic  potential  (e.g.  sedation, 
somnolence, feeling drunk). 
Most TEAEs were mild to moderate, only a minority were assessed as severe. There were no new TEAEs 
considered by the Sponsor as associated with long-term treatment up to 30 months. Dose effects were 
described only for the TEAE of dissociation.

Severe adverse events 
Pooled short-term studies TRD3001/3002 
Severe TEAEs were reported in 14.7% of subjects in the total esketamine + oral AD group, compared to 
5.0% of subjects in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group. The most common severe TEAEs in the total 
esketamine  +  oral  AD  group  included  dissociation  (3.8%  of  subjects),  vertigo  (2.9%),  and  dizziness, 
dysgeusia, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting (each reported in <2% subjects). In the oral AD + 
intranasal placebo group, no severe TEAEs were reported at the rate of 1% or higher.  The majority of 
severe TEAEs reported on intranasal dosing days resolved the same day (88.9% in the total esketamine 
+ oral AD group and 83.3% events in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group).  
Relapse prevention study TRD3003 
Severe TEAEs were reported in esketamine-treated subjects at the rate of 10.1% in the IND phase and 
7.5% in the OP phase. Most common severe TEAEs during the IND phase included somnolence (1.6%), 
dysgeusia (1.4%), sedation, dissociation, vertigo, and nausea (1.1% each); and during the OP phase, 
headache  (1.8%),  vertigo  (1.3%),  and  dissociation  (1.1%).  In  the  DB  MA  phase,  severe  TEAEs  were 
reported at the rate of 7.9% in the esketamine + oral AD group and 4.1% in the oral AD + intranasal 
placebo group. Most common severe TEAEs in the esketamine + oral AD group included somnolence, 
dysgeusia, nasal congestion, nasal discomfort, upper-airway cough syndrome, anxiety, and vertigo (each 
reported in 1.3%), and in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group, depression and headache (2.1% and 
1.4%, respectively) In the IND phase, 91.2% of the severe TEAEs reported on intranasal dosing days 
resolved  the  same  day.  In  the  OP  and  MA  phases,  100%  of  the  severe  TEAEs  reported  on  intranasal 
dosing days resolved the same day. 
Long-term safety study TRD3004 
In this study 14.7% of subjects reported TEAEs of severe intensity during the combined IND and OP/MA 
phases. Most common severe TEAEs (reported in at least 1% of subjects) included dissociation (1.9%), 
anxiety (1.6%), dizziness (1.6%), and nausea (1.2%). The overall rates of severe TEAEs in the IND and 
OP/MA  phases  were  8.2%  and  10.3%,  respectively.  During  the  IND  and  OP/MA  phases,  most  of  the 
severe TEAEs reported on intranasal dosing days resolved the same day (75%).

Adverse events by causality  
TEAEs were judged to be possibly related to intranasal esketamine at a high rate. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are AEs that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of 
esketamine based on a comprehensive assessment of available AE information.

TRD3002, TRD3003, TRD3004, TRD3005; Safety Analysis Sets) 
The highest incidences were attributed to Nervous system disorders (64.1%), Psychiatric disorders 
(46.1%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (32.2%). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Selected safety topics of interest were comprehensively examined. The following broadly defined safety 
categories of interest for the esketamine development program included: 
•  Psychiatric and nervous system disorders (comprised of suicidal ideation and behaviour; 
dissociative/perceptual changes; psychotic-like symptoms, anxiety, hypomania and mania; 
transient dizziness/vertigo, and sedation/somnolence) 
•  Potential effects on cognition 
• 
Interstitial cystitis and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms 
•  Post-dose gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) 
•  AEs potentially suggestive of abuse potential  
•  Withdrawal symptoms  
•  Cardiovascular safety (including changes in BP and pulse rates) 
•  Nasal tolerability and impact on sense of smell

Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Suicidal ideation was assessed using the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) throughout 
Phase 2 and 3 trials. 
Suicidal ideation at baseline was reported for 17.1% to 25.3% of subjects in the esketamine + oral AD 
group  and  16.9%  to  27.0%  of  subjects  in  the  oral  AD  +  intranasal  placebo  group  in  the  short-term 
studies. 
For  subjects  with  no  suicidal  ideation or  behaviour at  baseline,  the  rates  of  reported  suicidal  ideation 
(based on C-SSRS) at least once during the treatment phase were similar for the esketamine + oral AD 
groups and the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups in the short term DB studies (TRD3001/3002: 10.2% 
vs 12.3%, respectively; TRD3005: 13.8% vs 16.7%) and in the DB MA phase of the relapse prevention 
study  TRD3003  (2.4%  vs  4.5%).  Across  all  Phase  3  studies,  the  10  subjects  who  reported  suicidal 
behaviour  based  on  the  C-SSRS  (score  of  6-10)  had  a  lifetime  history  of  suicidal  ideation  or  suicidal 
behaviour. 
Worsening  of  suicidal  ideation/behaviour  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  no  suicidal  ideation  or 
behaviour at baseline, the proportion of subjects reporting suicidal ideation at any time post-baseline was 
similar in the esketamine + oral AD group and in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group during the DB 
IND phase of the pooled short-term studies (TRD3001/3002: 10.2% vs. 12.3%) and short-term elderly 
study (TRD3005: 13.8% vs. 16.7%), and in the DB MA phase of the relapse-prevention study (TRD3003: 
2.4% vs. 4.5%). Only a small number of subjects in this subgroup, all of whom had esketamine exposure, 
had suicidal behavior at any time post-baseline (1 [0.3%] subject in the IND phase of TRD3003; 2 [0.3%] 
subjects in IND phase of TRD3004, and 2 [0.4%] in the OP/MA Phase of TRD3004). In the subgroup of 
subjects with suicidal ideation at baseline across all Phase 3 studies, a total of 5 subjects, all of whom 
received  esketamine,  reported  suicidal  behaviour  at  any  time  post-baseline:  1  (1.2%)  subject  in  the 
esketamine + oral AD group in the pooled short-term studies TRD3001/3002 and 4 subjects in TRD3004 
(2 [1.6%] during the IND phase and 2 [2.2%] in the OP/MA Phase). 
Overall, across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, suicidality-related TEAEs were uncommon (~1% to 
5%), and most of the reported cases were those of suicidal ideation. In the controlled Phase 3 studies, the 
incidence of these events was overall consistent for the esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal 
placebo groups (pooled TRD3001/TRD3002: 0.9% vs 0.9%, respectively; TRD3005: 1.4% vs 0%; DB MA 
phase of TRD3003: 2.0% vs 0.7%). In the uncontrolled, OL long term safety study, 5.2% of subjects 
reported a suicidality-related TEAE across the entire study (Mod2.7.4/Tab28). Severe suicidality-related 
TEAEs were reported at a low incidence (<1% for individual preferred terms) in each of the Phase 2 and 
3 studies. 
Dissociation/perceptual changes 
Across completed Phase 2 and 3 studies, the most common psychological effects of esketamine have 
been dissociative/ perceptual changes (including distortion of time and space and illusions), derealization 
and  depersonalization  and  were  measured  using  CADSS  (Clinician  Administered  Dissociative  States 
Scale).  
Across  the  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  the  following  similar  pattern  of  change  was  observed  in  the  mean 
CADSS score in esketamine dosing sessions: dissociative/perceptual changes had an onset shortly after 
the start of dosing, peaked by 40 minutes post-dose, and typically returned to post-dose levels at the 
1.5-hour post-dose assessment. The maximum mean values did not exceed 10 (scale range of 0 to 92, 
with higher scores representing a more severe condition). 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 136/137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Over the course of each Phase 3 study, the peak mean CADSS total score at the 40-minute post-dose 
time-point  in  the  esketamine  +  oral  AD  groups  generally  decreased  with  consecutive  doses.  This 
attenuation  was  apparent  both  in  the  short-term  studies  as  well  as  with  prolonged  exposure  in  the 
long-term studies (see Figure 13 for study TRD3003). 
Figure  12:  Arithmetic  Mean  (+/-  SE)  Clinician-administered  Dissociative  States  Scale 
(CADSS) Total Score Over Time; Induction, Optimization, and Maintenance Phases 
(Study ESKETINTRD3003) 
Dissociative/perceptual changes were reported as adverse events at a rate of 12.5-27.6% across trials, 
primarily mild or moderate in severity, transient and self-limited.  Dissociation was reported as severe in 
intensity at the incidence of less than 4% across studies, was not considered serious for any subjects and 
rarely  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Transient  dissociative/perceptual  changes  were  more 
pronounced in subjects receiving higher doses of esketamine. 
Psychotic-like symptoms 
To  capture  the  extent  of  treatment-emergent  psychotic-like  symptoms  potentially  associated  with 
esketamine administration, the Phase 3 clinical trials included the 4 item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS)  +  subscale,  which  assessed  suspiciousness,  hallucinations,  unusual  thought  content,  and 
conceptual disorganization. 
Across all studies, a small mean increase in BPRS+ total score from baseline was observed at 40-minute 
post-dose  assessment  in  esketamine  +  oral  AD  treatment  groups  (mean  maximum  values  of  <1, 
indicating symptoms were ‘very mild’). After this transient, minimal worsening, mean scores generally 
returned to pre-dose values at the 1.5-hour post-dose assessment. In the short-term studies (TRD3001, 
TRD3002,  and  TRD3005),  the  mean  BPRS+  score  (possible  range:  0  -  24)  remained  below  1.2  at  all 
post-dose  time-points.  Although  mean  values  suggest  only  a  minimal  increase  in  BPRS+  score, 
percentages of patients with a total score of 3 or more were substantially higher in each of the phase III 
trials in the esketamine treated patients vs placebo patients (up to 28.1% versus 1.8% in TRD3002). 
No TEAEs of psychosis were reported across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD. 
Anxiety 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 137/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAE  grouped  terms  related  to  anxiety  (preferred  terms  of  anxiety,  anticipatory  anxiety,  and  anxiety 
disorder)  were  reported  at  higher  rates  in  the  esketamine  +  oral  AD  groups  than  in  the  oral  AD  + 
intranasal placebo group in the controlled Phase 3 studies/study phases in adults (TRD3001/TRD3002: 
9.0% vs 5.4%, respectively; DB MA phase of TRD3003: 7.9% vs 3.4%), but was reported less often in the 
esketamine + oral AD group for elderly subjects in TRD3005 (4.2% vs 7.7%). There was no apparent 
increase in the overall incidence of anxiety TEAEs with longer-term esketamine treatment, with anxiety 
preferred terms reported for 9.0% of subjects receiving esketamine + oral AD across both phases of the 
OL safety study TRD3004. Anxiety (grouped term) is identified as an ADR for esketamine. 
In the Phase 3 studies in TRD, severe anxiety TEAEs (individual preferred term) were uncommon in the 
esketamine + oral AD treatment groups (incidence rates of 0.3% to 1.4% across studies/study phases). 
The TEAE of anxiety only infrequently required rescue treatment (<4% in esketamine + oral AD groups 
for each study) or resulted in esketamine discontinuation (<2% across Phase 3 studies/study phases). 
Moreover, extreme levels of anxiety manifested as TEAEs of panic attacks was reported at low rates (<2% 
across studies/study phases). 
The reported frequency of anxiety TEAEs on each dosing day generally decreased after the first week of 
dosing  in  the  pooled  short-term  studies  TRD3001/3002  and  the  induction  phase  in  TRD3003  and 
TRD3004 (compared with the remainder of the study). 
Hypomania and mania 
Across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, the TEAE of mania was reported in only 2 esketamine-treated 
subjects  (1  report  after  first  dose  of  esketamine  and  oral  AD  [duloxetine]  and  second  report  during 
follow-up  phase),  while  hypomania  was  not  reported  in  any  subject.  Both  events  of  mania  resolved 
without sequelae. 
Transient dizziness or vertigo 
Examination of TEAEs related to dizziness and vertigo revealed higher rates for the esketamine + oral AD 
groups compared with the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups (pooled TRD3001/TRD3002: 46.5% vs 
9.9%, respectively; TRD3005: 27.8% vs 10.8%; DB MA phase of TRD3003: 43.4% vs 11.7%). Across the 
uncontrolled, OL long term safety study, dizziness and vertigo-related TEAEs were reported for 46.5% of 
subjects treated with esketamine + oral AD. 
Dizziness  and  vertigo  (individual  preferred  terms)  were  generally  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity, 
non-serious, and not treatment limiting. Across the Phase 3 studies/study phases, both of these individual 
TEAEs  were  reported  as  severe  in  intensity  at  incidences  of  <3%  and  resulted  in  discontinuation  of 
esketamine  in  <1%  of  subjects.  No  serious  individual  TEAEs  of  dizziness  or  vertigo  were  reported  in 
esketamine-treated subjects. 
Reported  TEAEs  of  dizziness  and  vertigo  following  esketamine  dosing  in  the  Phase  3  studies  were 
generally transient and self-limiting. Most of these events occurred on the day of dosing, and of those 
events  reported  on  the  day  of  dosing,  almost  all  (>95%)  resolved  spontaneously  the  same  day. 
Decreases in the reporting frequencies of dizziness and vertigo were observed early in treatment (i.e., on 
Days  1  through  8)  compared  with  subsequent  nasal  spray  dosing  sessions  in  the  short-term  studies 
TRD3001/3002 and the long-term studies TRD3003 and TRD3004. 
Sedation/Somnolence 
Across  all  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  sedation  was  one  of  the  most  common  effects  associated  with 
esketamine treatment. Sedation was measured using the MOAA/S (Modified Observer’s Assessment of 
Alertness/Sedation)  scale.  Based  on  the  MOAA/S,  sedative  effects  were  generally  mild,  had  an  onset 
shortly after the start of the dose and typically resolved by 1 to 1.5 hours post-dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 138/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs  of  somnolence  (12.1-21.1%)  and  sedation  (4.2-10.1%)  were  primarily  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity, occurred on the day of intranasal dosing and resolved spontaneously the same day, with the 
median duration under 2 hours across dosing sessions. These TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 
isolated cases and reported as a SAE in only 1 subject across all Phase 2 and 3 studies. Rates of TEAEs of 
somnolence were relatively stable over time during longer-term treatment. 
Effects on cognition 
In the Phase 3 studies in TRD, the potential effect of esketamine on cognition was evaluated using 2 
standardized tests: (1) the CogState, shown to provide a rapid and reliable assessment of subtle changes 
in  multiple  cognitive  domains,  including  attention/processing  speed,  visual  learning  and  memory, 
working memory, and executive function, and (2) the HVLT-R test, a brief measure of verbal learning and 
memory. 
In the Phase 3 short-term studies, performance on each of the cognitive tests demonstrated either an 
improvement from baseline or appeared stable relative to baseline both at the end of the DB induction 
phase and at the 2-week follow-up assessment. 
One of the primary safety objectives of the OL safety study TRD3004 was to examine the potential effects 
of long-term esketamine treatment on cognitive function. Overall, results of group mean performance on 
tests  of  attention/reaction  time  and  higher  level  cognitive  domains  either  remained  stable  or  showed 
slight improvement from baseline in all enrolled subjects as well as among subgroups of subjects aged 
<65 years and those aged ≥65 years.  
•  The exception was for tests assessing simple and choice reaction time which showed a slowing 
starting at Week 20 of the OP/MA phase in the elderly subgroup, with the greatest slowing 
seen at Week 44. As there was a substantial decrease in the number of elderly subjects at the 
latter time-points in this study due, in part, to the early study termination upon achieving the 
required exposure to esketamine, post hoc analyses were conducted for the elderly subjects 
who completed the study. In elderly completers, the mean slowing in reaction time at the 
Week 52 endpoint was of a magnitude representing an effect size of 0.52 for simple reaction 
test and 0.47 for choice reaction test (Cohen’s d), and there was considerable intra-individual 
variability in reaction time among elderly subjects. No elderly subject demonstrated impaired 
reaction time performance at endpoint that persisted into the follow up phase. In the absence 
of a comparator group in TRD3004 or published longitudinal studies of reaction time in elderly 
MDD/TRD patients, firm conclusions cannot be made as to whether the high intra-individual 
variability  in  reaction  time  observed  in  TRD3004  is  characteristic  of  the  elderly  MDD/TRD 
population.  Therefore,  Cognitive  disorders  and  memory  impairment  (long-term  use)  have 
been included in the risk management plan (RMP) as important potential risk, to be further 
investigated via the category 3 study 54135419TRD3008, an open-label long-term extension 
safety study of intranasal esketamine in TRD (currently ongoing; the clinical study report is 
awaited by Q1 2023; annual analyses of safety results should also be provided until study 
completion). 
•  Results of the elderly completer analyses showed that the performance on tests of other, more 
complex cognitive domains was not affected, which was consistent with results of analyses 
involving the all enrolled analysis set (and by-age subgroup analyses). 
No  TEAEs  related  to  cognitive  impairment  (i.e.,  preferred  terms,  cognitive  disorder,  cognitive  motor 
disorder) were reported in the Phase 3 studies in TRD. 
Interstitial cystitis and lower urinary tract symptoms 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 139/140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Phase 2 and 3 studies with esketamine included monitoring for symptoms of cystitis or lower urinary 
tract symptoms using the BPIC-SS (Bladder Pain/ Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Score). Subjects with a 
score > 18 on the scale were further evaluated for interstitial cystitis and urinary tract infection. Virtually 
all cases with complaints could be related to bacterial infections. Urinary tract symptoms in general were 
reversible. There were no cases of interstitial cystitis (including ulcerative cystitis) in any of the clinical 
trials  with  esketamine,  which  involved  treatment  for  up  to  30  months.  Pollakiuria  (also  prolonged), 
dysuria,  micturition  urgency,  nocturia  and  cystitis  were  reported  more  often  compared  to  placebo. 
Interstitial cystitis is a serious adverse reaction that may result in persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity. Given that no cases of esketamine nasal spray-related interstitial cystitis were observed in any 
of  the  Phase 2  and  Phase 3  trials,  which  involved  treatment  for  up  to  1 year,  the  impact  on  the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product  is  expected  to  be  low.  With  intermittent  exposure  at  the  doses  of 
28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg recommended in the SmPC for treatment of patients with TRD, the bladder has 
sufficient time between dosing sessions for self-repair from any potential irritation. However, in clinical 
trials with esketamine nasal spray, there was a higher rate of lower urinary tract symptoms (pollakiuria, 
dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and cystitis) in esketamine nasal spray-treated patients than in 
placebo-treated  patients.  Therefore,  Interstitial  cystitis  (long-term  use)  was  included  in  the  RMP  as 
Important potential risk, requiring further evaluation via the category 3 study 54135419TRD3008 above 
outlined. 
Post-dose Gastrointestinal Symptoms of Nausea and Vomiting 
Study protocols restricted food consumption for at least 2 hours before dosing and fluids for at least 30 
min before dosing with intranasal study drug.  
Across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent gastrointestinal 
TEAEs  in  esketamine-treated  subjects  In  the  controlled  Phase  3  studies,  nausea  and  vomiting  were 
reported at higher rates for the esketamine + oral AD groups than for the oral AD + intranasal placebo 
group  (pooled  TRD3001/TRD3002:  28.3%  vs  8.6%,  respectively,  for  nausea;  9.2%  vs  1.8%, 
respectively, for vomiting; TRD3005: 18.1% vs 4.6% for nausea; 6.9% vs 1.5% for vomiting; DB MA 
phase of TRD3003: 16.4% vs 0.7% for nausea; 6.6% vs 0.7% for vomiting). In the OL long-term safety 
study TRD3004, nausea and vomiting were reported for 25.1% and 10.8%,  of subjects, respectively, 
across both study phases. 
In the pooled TRD3001/TRD3002 studies, ~85% of TEAEs of nausea and vomiting were reported on the 
day of dosing for esketamine treated subjects, with 81% of reports of nausea and 98% of reports of 
vomiting resolving the same day. The same pattern was seen in elderly subjects and for each phase of the 
relapse  prevention  study  TRD3003.  Over  the  up  to  1-year  treatment  period  for  TRD3004,  ~80%  of 
reports of nausea and vomiting occurred on the day of dosing (83% and 81%, respectively), and of these 
postdose events, approximately 89% resolved the same day. 
TEAEs of nausea and vomiting were primarily mild or moderate in severity, transient, and self limited with 
the median duration not exceeding 1 hour in most subjects across dosing sessions. Nausea and vomiting 
were reported as severe in intensity at incidences under 2% across studies/study phases. No SAEs of 
nausea and vomiting were reported in esketamine-treated subjects. Discontinuation of study drug due to 
nausea and vomiting was reported in less than 1% of subjects. Rates of reported nausea and vomiting 
decreased over time. 
Abuse potential 
An  abuse  potential  for  ketamine  is  well-known  and  recognized  by  the  WHO.  The  results  of  TRD1015 
indicate that the abuse potential of intranasal administration of esketamine is similar to IV administration 
of ketamine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 140/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The exact mechanism underlying esketamine’s abuse potential is unknown. Esketamine is active within 
the central nervous system (CNS) and has a mechanism of action similar to that of racemic ketamine. As 
antagonists of NMDA receptors, both ketamine and esketamine induce psychoactive effects. Ketamine is 
a known drug of abuse recreationally and induces psychological effects, including dissociation and other 
perceptual  distortions;  alterations  in  cognition;  and  changes  in  mood.  The  most  common  way  that 
ketamine is used recreationally is insufflation. 
Data  from  all  clinical  studies  with  esketamine  nasal  spray  were  examined  for  the  occurrence  of 
CNS-related  AEs  suggestive  that  the  drug  might  be  sought  out  by  patients  for  abuse  purposes  in 
accordance with FDA’s guidance on assessment of a drug’s abuse potential. 
Across all clinical studies, there were no reported TEAEs (individual preferred terms) of overdose or drug 
abuse. Approximately one-half of adult subjects treated with esketamine in the Phase 2 and 3 studies 
reported at least 1 TEAE suggestive of abuse potential, with post-dose events of dizziness, somnolence, 
and  dissociation  being  the  most  common.  these  symptoms  are  predominantly  reported  shortly  after 
dosing on the day of esketamine administration, are transient and self-limiting, and mild or moderate in 
intensity. Other events, such as euphoric mood, feeling drunk, or feeling abnormal, were also observed 
but occurred at considerably lower incidences. These additional events were also transient in nature and 
resolved the same day of dosing in almost all cases. After up to 1 year of repeated intermittent dosing 
with esketamine in the OL long-term safety study, the reporting frequencies of TEAEs of euphoric mood, 
feeling drunk, and feeling abnormal were 1.9% to 3.4%. 
There  were  no  reports  of  drug  seeking  behaviour  made  during  the  studies  (i.e.,  calls  to  the  sites 
requesting more frequent treatment sessions or increase in dose above that allowed in study).  
Drug abuse is considered an important identified risk for esketamine nasal spray. The following routine 
and additional risk minimisation measures (RMMs) 
The  abuse  potential  of  esketamine  nasal  spray  and  its  mitigation  are  addressed  in  the  EU  product 
information  (EU  PI)  (ie,  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  [SmPC]  and  Package  Leaflet  [PL])  and 
include the following concepts: 
Esketamine nasal spray is administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional. 
The recommended dosing of esketamine nasal spray is twice weekly for 4 weeks, followed by weekly or 
every-other-week dosing for patients with a favorable clinical response. During longer-term treatment, 
physicians are recommended to individualize the dosing frequency to the lowest frequency needed to 
maintain the patient’s clinical response and to perform periodic re-evaluation of patients to determine the 
need for continued treatment.  
Individuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence may be at greater risk for abuse and misuse of 
esketamine nasal spray. Physicians are advised to assess individuals prior to treatment for a history of 
substance use disorder and to monitor for signs of abuse or dependence. 
Esketamine nasal spray is designed with the following features to deter abuse (and misuse): 
1.  The product is supplied in limited pack sizes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 141/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The drug product is contained in a Type I glass vial sealed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper. The filled and 
stoppered vial is seated into a container holder assembled into a manually activated nasal spray device. 
The device is difficult to disassemble due to interlocking design features of the actuator subassembly. 
Attempts to break open the device damage the vial and the contents are lost. The force required to pull 
the device apart is at least 60 Newtons (~13 pounds). If the device is taken apart, the stoppered vial 
provides an additional challenge to disassembly, as it is very difficult to pull the stopper out. Breaking the 
vial instead results in loss of the contents. 
2.  The  product  is  supplied  as  a  single-use  device  containing  a  total  of  32.3  mg  of  esketamine  HCl 
(equivalent  to  28  mg  of  esketamine).  When  manually  actuated,  the  device  dispenses  2 individual 
sprays; no sprays remain after the second spray is actuated. 
3.  The nasal spray device has a nominal fill volume of 230 μL and a delivery volume of 200 μL. The 
average  measured  residual  volume  left  in  the  nasal  spray  device  after  actuation  is  ~30μL  (4  mg 
base). 
Legal  controls  (e.g.,  restrictions  on  storage  and  prescribing  including  special  and  restricted  medical 
prescription  with  categorization  at  the  Member  State  level)  will  be  in  place  according  to  local  legal 
requirements in the majority of Member States (MS) where esketamine is currently scheduled, either 
directly  or  indirectly  due  to  its  chemical  relationship  to  ketamine.  In  these  Member  States  (MS),  it  is 
proposed that the scheduling class should be the same as that which applies already to any ketamine- or 
esketamine-containing medicinal product. The following recommendations minimize the risk of abuse, 
diversion  and  misuse.  Any  unused  medicinal  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in 
accordance with local requirements. All treatment should be administered under the direct supervision of 
a healthcare professional (HCP) and signs of abuse or dependence should be carefully monitored. 
No  unsupervised  administration  of  the  product  is  allowed.  Furthermore,  a  controlled  access  program 
should be implemented, as key element to ensure esketamine nasal spray is dispensed to the healthcare 
settings  where  administration  takes  place,  as  agreed  at  the  Member  State  level,  based  on  local  legal 
requirements and/or local healthcare systems. 
A  HCP  Guide  and  a  Patient  Guide  containing  key  messages  regarding  product  administration  and  the 
potential for abuse and dependence are also agreed as additional RMMs.  
Withdrawal 
All Phase 3 studies included the PWC 20 to systematically assess the risk of dependence with short- and 
long-term use of esketamine nasal spray. The PWC-20 was measured at the 1- and 2-week follow-up 
visits in Studies TRD3001, TRD3002, TRD3005, and TRD3003 and at the 1-, 2- and 4-week follow-up 
visits in the long-term OL Study TRD3004. Given the short half-life of esketamine, a 2-week follow-up was 
expected to be sufficient to assess potential symptoms of withdrawal. 
Across  studies,  the  changes  in  withdrawal  symptoms  assessed  by  the  PWC  20  after  cessation  of 
esketamine + oral AD treatment were consistent with observed changes in symptoms of depression and 
anxiety. Reported symptoms were primarily mild to moderate in severity. New worsening of depression 
symptoms  was  observed  mostly  in  subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  lack  of  therapeutic 
response.  Based  on  the  PWC-20  results,  there  was  no  evidence  suggestive  of  a  distinct  withdrawal 
syndrome at 1 or 2 weeks after cessation of esketamine treatment in TRD3003 or at 1, 2, or 4 weeks after 
cessation of esketamine treatment in TRD3004. 
Cardiovascular safety 
Heart rate, blood pressure and ECG 
The impact of esketamine on BP and heart rate was evaluated in the Phase 2 and 3 studies through vital 
sign measurements performed pre- and post-dosing with the nasal spray study drug  
Transient,  primarily  asymptomatic,  increases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  BP  were  observed  following 
esketamine administration in all Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, with maximum mean changes typically 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019

observed  within  40  minutes  of  dosing  and  mean  BP  values  subsequently  returning  to,  or  close  to, 
pre-dose values within the 1.5-hour post-dose time-point 
Across the Phase 3 studies/study phases, treatment-emergent markedly abnormal elevations of SBP to ≥
180 mm Hg or DBP to ≥110 mm Hg (i.e., acute hypertension) were reported at rates of <5% among the 
esketamine  treatment  groups  for  the  pooled  studies  TRD3001/TRD3002  (0.9%  for  total  oral  AD  + 
intranasal placebo group) and all study phases of TRD3003 and TRD3004; the exception was for study 
TRD3005 in elderly subjects where the percentage was 11.1% (6.2% for oral AD + intranasal placebo). 
These elevations primarily occurred within 1.5 hours after dosing, and the rates for subjects meeting 
these acute hypertension criteria were higher among subjects with a history of hypertension than in those 
without such a history. 
Exposure-response PK/PD models were developed to describe the relationship between SBP and DBP and 
esketamine plasma concentration. 
Observed mean increases in pulse rate following esketamine administration were not clinically meaningful 
in any of the Phase 3 studies. In the controlled Phase 3 studies/study phases, the proportion of subjects 
with a treatment-emergent abnormal increase in pulse rate (≥15 bpm relative to baseline to a value ≥100 
bpm) was less than 9% and similar for the esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo groups. 
Esketamine administration did not produce any meaningful changes in ECG parameters and had no effect 
on cardiac repolarization in a thorough QT study TRD1013). 
AEs related to cardiovascular safety 
Adverse events in this category included an examination of TEAEs grouped terms related to increased BP 
and increased heart rate (preferred terms included for type of event listed in Mod2.7.4/Tab4). TEAEs 
related to increased heart rate occurred at low incidence rates (<2%) across the Phase 3 studies/study 
phases.  By  comparison,  TEAEs  related  to  increased  BP  were  reported  at  higher  frequencies  following 
treatment with esketamine + oral AD compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo in the controlled Phase 3 
studies/study  phases  (pooled  TRD3001/TRD3002  studies:  10.1%  vs  2.7%,  respectively;  TRD3005: 
13.9%  vs  6.2%:  DB  MA  phase  of  TRD3003:  8.6%  vs  3.4%).  Across  the  OL  long-term  safety  study 
TRD3004, TEAEs related to increased BP were reported for 12.8% of subjects receiving esketamine + oral 
AD (Mod2.7.4/Tab37). In the DB phases of Phase 2 study TRD2003, the reporting rate for TEAEs related 
to  increased  BP  was  13.1%  across  all  esketamine  groups  and  7.4%  for  the  placebo  group; no  TEAEs 
related to increased heart rate were reported in the DB phases of this study.  
Among esketamine-treated subjects in the Phase 3 studies, very few of the TEAEs (individual preferred 
terms) of BP increased or tachycardia were severe (≤0.2% in all study/study phases except TRD3005 
where incidence of severe increased BP TEAEs was 1.4% [representing 1 subject]). Further, TEAEs of 
increased  BP  or  tachycardia  were  reported  as  serious  in  only  isolated  cases,  and  discontinuation  of 
esketamine treatment for these events occurred in <2% of subjects across studies/study phases . 
Between 90% and 100% of the reported TEAE preferred term of increased BP occurred on the day of 
dosing in the Phase 3 studies/study phases and of these, >93% resolved spontaneously the same day. 
A subgroup analyses revealed that patients with cardiovascular risk factors (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, diabetes 
mellitus,  hypertension,  or  hypercholesterolemia)  who  are 
taking  esketamine  experience 
cardiovascular-related adverse events more frequently than those without.   
Keeping in mind that Spravato will be prescribed by psychiatrists, who might not be very familiar with 
cardiovascular diseases, it might be helpful to keep the examples as an orientation for them. 
Overall, Due to the transient and self-limiting nature of the cardiovascular effects observed in clinical 
trials, the overall impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product is considered low; however, the impact

on an individual patient may be significant. The SmPC and PL, as well as the Healthcare Professional Guide 
and Patient Guide, provide information to the prescriber and the patient on how to manage the risk. A 
checklist for readiness to leave will be provided to aid   HCP  in  determining  when  a  patient  is  deemed 
stable and should safely be allowed to return home following esketamine nasal spray administration. 
Nasal Tolerability and Sense of Smell 
Across  Phase  2  and  3  studies  there  were  no  nasal  exam  findings  or  Nasal  Symptom  Questionnaire 
evidence to support an impact on nasal anatomy or function including the sense of smell assessed by the 
UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and the Smell Threshold Test scores.  
Most esketamine-treated subjects had no findings upon nasal examination, detected abnormalities were 
mostly  of  mild  severity  (consisting  mainly  of  nasal  erythema,  nasal  discharge,  nasal  crust),  with  the 
exception of a few moderate findings and no findings that were severe. The frequency of these symptoms 
did not increase with continued administration. 
Nasal tolerability of esketamine nasal spray was good, also after long term treatment.  
Interim data on AESIs from TRD3008 appear to be similar to what has been observed before.

In the controlled Phase 3 studies, serious TEAEs were reported in subjects receiving esketamine + oral AD 
at rates that were low and generally similar to those in subjects receiving oral AD + intranasal placebo. 
Across all studies, the most frequently reported SAEs were in the psychiatric disorders category and were 
associated with the underlying disease state.  
The SAEs assessed as related to study treatment in the Phase 3 short-term studies by the investigator 
included 1 subject each with depression, headache, increased blood pressure, and anxiety disorder.  
In the long-term studies most SAEs were considered to be not associated with esketamine. Events at least 
possibly  related  to  study  treatment  included  1  subject  each  with  disorientation,  suicidal  ideation, 
sedation,  autonomic  nervous  system  imbalance  and  simple  partial  seizures,  lacunar  stroke,  and 
hypothermia (TRD3003) and 1 subject each with delirium, anxiety and delusion, suicidal ideation, and 
suicidal attempt (TRD3004). 
During the ongoing TRD3008 one patient had a hypertensive emergency 2 min after esketamine 28 mg 
application,  which  was  regarded  as  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  During  the  ongoing  and  still 
blinded Study SUI3001/2 one patient had to be discontinued due to a hypertransaminasaemia. 
No dose-relationship of SAEs could be observed.

Deaths 
Until cut-off date of 31 December 2018, a total of 7 deaths were reported. 
In the primary safety analysis set across the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, there were 4 deaths 
(0.2%) among the 1,708 subjects treated with esketamine + oral AD. No deaths occurred in the oral AD

In addition, in the ongoing uncontrolled long-term study TRD3008, a total of 3 deaths were reported in 
the interim-report, one completed suicide and one accidental polytrauma were regarded as not related 
and one myocardial infarction was regarded as doubtfully related to study treatment.  
A total of 3 completed suicides were reported among the total of 7 deaths. All cases of completed suicide 
occurred in completed or ongoing open-label studies/study phases with no control group and had a 
latency of 20 (TRD2003), 12 (TRD3004) and 4 days (TRD3008) to the last dose of esketamine. None of 
the cases were considered to be related to esketamine treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  laboratory  analytes  (hematology,  chemistry,  urinalysis 
parameters) from baseline were observed in any of the completed Phase 2 and 3 TRD studies.  
Across  Phase  2  and  3  TRD  studies,  there  were  isolated  cases  in  which  TEAEs  were  associated  with 
abnormal laboratory results. There was no clinically important difference between oral AD placebo and 
esketamine plus oral AD groups in the incidence of these AEs. Only isolated laboratory-related AEs were 
recorded as serious and infrequently resulted in discontinuation.  
Liver enzymes

Across the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD, increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of greater than 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred at low 
rates among the esketamine + oral AD treatment groups (ie, <2% in all studies/study phases). 
The observed increases in ALT/AST in the Phase 3 studies in TRD were primarily asymptomatic, transient, 
and resolved spontaneously without worsening while treatment with esketamine + oral AD continued. No 
persistent increases in liver transaminases were observed. 
Across  all  completed  studies  with  esketamine,  no  subject  met  the  criteria  for  severe  drug-induced 
hepatocellular  injury  as  defined  by  Hy’s  law.  Further,  no  cases  of  treatment  emergent  elevated  total 
serum bilirubin levels to >2x ULN were identified in esketamine-treated subjects. 
Oxygen saturation and Respiratory Rate 
At least 2 consecutive oxygen saturation levels below 93% within the same visit were reported only in 
isolated  cases  across  Phase  3  studies.  These  cases  were  not  associated  with  clinical  symptoms  of 
compromised respiratory function and resolved spontaneously in postdose period and prior to discharge. 
No clinically significant decreases in respiratory rate were observed in the Phase 3 studies.  
Body weight 
No clinically notable changes in mean body weight from baseline were observed in the short term Phase 
2 and 3 studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex 
In the main studies the majority of patients were female (~65%) and overall incidence of TEAEs were also 
higher in female subjects than in male subjects (approximately 5-10% higher). No clinically relevant 
differences between female and male patients were apparent.    
Elderly 
The population included in the short term phase 3 trials TRD3001 and 3002 and the relapse prevention 
study TRD3003 was between 18 and 65 years of age. The short-term study TRD3005 was performed in 
elderly patients aged > 65 years, of whom a number also entered the long-term trials TRD3004 and 3008. 
Due to the pharmacokinetic differences described for the elderly population as an increase of Cmax and 
AUC compared to younger adults, the starting dose was reduced to 28 mg in TRD3005. On Day 25, 64.5% 
of the subjects in the esketamine + oral AD group received the 84-mg dose, 25.8% received the 56-mg 
dose, and 9.7% received the 28-mg dose. Of the 194 subjects included in 25 were > 75 years of age. 
The most common TEAEs (reported by ≥10% subjects) observed more frequently in the esketamine vs. 
the  placebo  group  were:  dizziness  (20.8%  versus  7.7%),  nausea  (18.1%  versus  4.6%),  headache 
(12.5% versus 3.1%), fatigue (12.5% versus 7.7%), BP increased (12.5% versus 4.6%), dissociation 
(12.5% versus 1.5%), and vertigo (11.1% versus 3.1%). The most common TEAE (reported by ≥5% 
subjects) observed more frequently in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group was anxiety (7.7% versus 
2.8%). 
Frequencies and pattern of TEAES revealed no clinically meaningful differences between patients <65 
years and patients ≥ 65 years A dose relationship of TEAEs has not been observed. 
Race 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 147/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Throughout Phase 3 trials most patients were white (>80% in every trial), a small percentage was black 
(between 0 and 6.1%) and the rest was of other race. Drawing firm conclusions based on comparisons 
between the subsets was not regarded to be appropriate due to the large imbalances in sample sizes. The 
provided description of the TEAE patterns do not suggest a clinically meaningful difference between races. 
Throughout Phase 1 trials differences in the PK in the Asian population were described. Please refer to the 
Pharmacology  Assessment  Report.  Data  from  the  ongoing  study  TRD2005  in  Japanese  subjects  are 
outstanding. 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment  
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were specifically excluded from Phase 3 studies. Esketamine is 
metabolized in the liver, and hepatic clearance is required for a termination of the clinical effects. There 
are  preclinical  findings  suggestive  of  hepatotoxicity.  A  number  of  cases  of  liver  damage  (bile  duct 
dilatation and hepatic enzymes elevation) have been reported in literature related to (off-label) long-term 
ketamine use.  
Results  of  TRD1011  show  increases  in  Cmax  (8%  higher)  and  AUC  (114%  higher)  in  subjects  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment.  The  reported  rates  of  TEAEs  were  higher  in  patients  with  mild  and 
moderate hepatic impairment in comparison with subjects with normal liver function (37.5% vs 25%). 
Throughout Phase 2 and 3 trials there were no TEAEs of cholangiopathy, cholestasis, or biliary dilatation 
associated with esketamine treatment and no treatment emergent elevated total serum bilirubin levels 
>2x ULN. Transient asymptomatic increases of ALT and AST occurred at low rates. 
Patients with Renal Impairment  
Subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  specifically  excluded  from  Phase  3  studies.  Esketamine 
metabolites are mainly excreted with urine. An increase in Cmax (20 to 26% higher) and AUC (13 to 36% 
higher) was observed in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment in TRD1014. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Esketamine has not been studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women and these subjects were excluded 
from the clinical trials. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. The clinical significance of 
these nonclinical findings is not known.  
18 pregnancies were reported in subjects exposed to esketamine throughout the clinical trial programme 
up to 27 March 2019:  
Outcomes included 2 ectopic pregnancies, 4 spontaneous abortions, 2 elective abortion, all assessed as 
not related to esketamine administration by the sponsor due to risk factors including advanced maternal 
age,  obesity,  previous  history  of  spontaneous  abortion,  and  sterilization  procedure  (for  the  cases  of 
ectopic pregnancy).  3 pregnancies are described as unknown outcome. 
The 3 healthy babies were reported in partners of male subjects who were exposed to esketamine No 
congenital anomalies were reported.

The  possibility  of  foetal  neurotoxicity  cannot  be  excluded  based  on  published  findings  in  animals.  As 
outlined in the product information, esketamine nasal spray is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Use during pregnancy is included in esketamine 
nasal spray RMP as missing information. To further characterize the impact of this missing information on 
the safety profile of esketamine nasal spray periodic safety assessments of data will be conducted from a 
US-based pregnancy registry for psychiatric medications, including antidepressants. The aims of review 
of this registry data are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
To  prospectively  evaluate  rates  of  congenital  malformations  among  infants  exposed  in  utero  to 
psychiatric medications; 
To evaluate neonatal outcomes of infants with prenatal exposure to specific psychiatric medications 
alone or in combination with other psychotropics; 
To  evaluate  maternal  health  outcomes  associated  with  use  of  psychiatric  medications  during 
pregnancy; 
To evaluate neurobehavioral development of children (1 month and older) with prenatal exposure to 
psychiatric medications. 
Immunological events 
No discussion has been provided by the Applicant, since it concerns a well-known small molecule. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
All subjects were treated with a SSRI/SNRI in addition to esketamine. No data on the combination with 
other oral antidepressants is available.  
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Changes in the activity of CYP enzymes (CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) are expected to influence the oral 
bioavailability of esketamine, however, due to nasal administration, where approximately half of the dose 
is absorbed via nasal mucosa avoiding the first-pass metabolism in the liver, nasal esketamine is 
expected to have a low propensity to pharmacokinetic interactions. 
Pretreatment with oral ticlopidine or oral clarithromycin, inhibitors of hepatic CYP2B6 and CYP3A activity, 
respectively, produced small changes in the pharmacokinetics of nasally administered esketamine. 
Pretreatment with oral rifampicin, a potent inducer of the activity of multiple hepatic CYP enzymes such 
as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, decreased the mean Cmax and AUC∞ values of nasally administered esketamine 
by approximately 17% and 28%, respectively. 
Administration of 84 mg nasal esketamine twice a week for 2 weeks did not affect the activity of hepatic 
CYP2B6 activity, using oral bupropion as a probe substrate. The same regimen of esketamine reduced the 
mean plasma AUC of oral midazolam by approximately 16%. 
The Applicant presented a post-hoc analysis of esketamine exposure under co-medication of oral 
antidepressant (ie, duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine) based on a Pop PK model 
revealing a reduced Cmax by 1,5%, which is not likely to be clinically relevant.  
Physiologically based PK modeling and simulation were performed to assess the potential drug-drug 
interaction of nasal esketamine towards ethinyl estradiol indicating that no effect of esketamine on ethinyl 
estradiol plasma concentrations is predicted. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 149/150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted  by  the  Applicant.  In  line  with  other 
ketamine/esketamine products potential interactions with CNS depressants, psychostimulants or drugs 
that  may  increase  blood  pressure  (e.g.,  xanthine  derivatives,  ergometrine,  thyroid  hormones, 
vasopressin or MAOI) are expected or cannot be excluded. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  esketamine  were  reported  at  low  rates,  which  were  higher  in  the 
esketamine groups compared to placebo groups: 
Esketamine + oral AD 
placebo + oral AD

TRD3003 
4.6% 
5.6% 
2.6% 
1.4% 
3.1% 
2.1% 
After longer-term exposure to esketamine in TRD3003, discontinuation rates for nasal study drug during 
the DB MA phase were similar for the esketamine and placebo groups.  
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  due  to  TEAEs  observed  in  the  Phase  3  uncontrolled,  OL  safety  study 
(TRD3004) with esketamine treatment exposure of up to 1 year was 9.5%.  
The rates of discontinuations of esketamine treatment due to TEAEs were generally highest immediately 
after treatment initiation. In the Phase 3 short-term studies in adults (TRD3001, TRD3002), nearly all 
discontinuations due to TEAEs in esketamine-treated subjects occurred within the first 2 weeks of the DB 
phase.  In  the  Phase  3  relapse  prevention  (TRD3003)  and  OL  long-term  safety  (TRD3004)  studies, 
discontinuations due to TEAEs in esketamine-treated subjects occurred in higher rates in the IND phase 
compared to the OP and/or MA phases 
Across  the  Phase  3  studies,  TEAEs  leading  to  esketamine  discontinuation  in  more  than  2  subjects 
(>0.1%) were (in order of frequency): anxiety, depression, blood pressure increased, dizziness, suicidal 
ideation,  dissociation,  nausea,  vomiting,  headache,  muscular  weakness,  vertigo,  hypertension,  panic 
attack, and sedation.   
The types of TEAES leading to discontinuation of esketamine in the Phase 2 studies in TRD (TRD2003) and 
MDSI (SUI2001) and in the Phase 1 studies were generally consistent with those observed in the Phase 3 
studies in TRD. It was noted that a correlation between discontinuation and dose administered was not 
investigated. 
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Esketamine,  the  S-enantiomer  of  racemic  ketamine,  is  a  well-known  active  substance  approved  as 
solution for injection in induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in some EU countries. The racemic 
ketamine is in widespread use worldwide for the same indications since the 1970s and is on the World 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 150/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Health  Organization’s  List  of  Essential  Medicines.  Hence,  the  experience  with  the  use  of  the  active 
substance  is  broad.  Psychiatric  (e.g.  dissociation,  dizziness,  anxiety),  cardiovascular  (e.g.  increased 
blood pressure and heart rate) or gastrointestinal (e.g. nausea, vomiting) ADRs are well known as well as 
the potential for drug abuse. 
The  presented  clinical  development  program  aimed  at  collecting  sufficient  information  on  the  safety 
profile of nasal esketamine spray in the target population with TRD over the intended therapeutic dose 
range of 56 to 84 mg up to twice applications weekly. Achieved plasma levels are below those required for 
induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. 
The Applicant chose to focus the primary safety analysis on phase 2 study TRD2003 and completed phase 
3  studies  including  both  short  term  studies  (TRD3001/3002/3005)  as  well  as  long-term  studies 
(TRD3003/3004) and a study evaluating esketamine in an elderly population (TRD3005).  
In total 1708 subjects were included in the primary safety analysis, with 178 subjects receiving intranasal 
esketamine for at least 12 months. Interim Results (cutoff date 31st Dec 2018) are available from the 
ongoing study TRD3008 for the long-term treatment of 927 treated at least 12 months and up to 30 
months  (n=54).  The  overall  long-term  exposure  is  acceptable.  So  far,  no  trends  over  time  could  be 
observed for long-term effects on suicidality, cognition, interstitial cystitis/lower urinary tract symptoms 
as well as on hepatic disorders. Full data of the long-term ongoing study TRD3008 is, however, not yet 
available. 
Across the clinical studies adverse events were reported more frequently in patients using esketamine 
than  patients  in  the  oral  AD  +  intranasal  placebo  groups.  Approximately  70-90%  of  patients  in  the 
esketamine  groups  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  compared  to  45-60%  in  the  oral  AD  + 
intranasal placebo groups. Most of the adverse events reported in the esketamine groups occurred on the 
same day as dosing (65~90%). Of these events almost all also were resolved that day (approximately 
90%). Transient post-dose symptoms (e.g. dissociation, dizziness, nausea), were expected based on the 
pharmacological  profile  and  the  already  known  ADR  profile  of  esketamine  solution  for  injection  and 
generally resolved without clinical sequelae in less than 2h. TEAEs that did not resolve the same day were 
mostly considered as associated either with the underlying (depression) or other co-occurring conditions. 
Cases of prolonged pollakuria were observed in the esketamine groups and this has been reflected in the 
SPC.    
The Applicant provided sufficient information on the dose relationship on incidences and severity of 
TEAEs. Across trials no clear evidence for a dose response relationship could be seen for the incidence of 
TEAEs, for TEAEs leading to discontinuation of intranasal study medication, for SAEs or for TEAEs leading 
to dose interruptions. 
For the TEAE dissociation, which is supposed to be dose related, only in TRD3005 and TRD3004 a clear 
dose relationship could be observed. 
A PK/PD model revealed a correlation between blood pressure and plasma concentrations.  
Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Overall, the results across Phase 2 and 3 studies 
including FU phases were consistent, no new adverse events were reported for elderly patients or with 
long-term repeated esketamine dosing (up to 1 year of exposure). Adverse events categorized as severe 
were reported infrequent and often self-limiting.  
A  Systematic  evaluation  of  adverse  event  data  from  the  completed  Phase  2  and  3  studies  identified 
24 ADR terms for esketamine (15 grouped ADR terms and 9 individual ADR terms) with the following 
attributed frequencies: 
Very  common  ADRs:  Dissociation,  Anxiety,  Dysgeusia,  Dizziness,  Sedation,  Headache,  Hypoesthesia, 
Vertigo, Vomiting, Nausea, Blood Pressure Increased  
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 151/152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common ADRs: Euphoric mood, Mental impairment, Tremor, Lethargy, Dysarthria, Tachycardia, Nasal 
discomfort, Dry mouth, Hyperhidrosis, Pollakiuria, Feeling abnormal, Feeling drunk  
Uncommon ADRs: Salivary hypersecretion 
Overall, the described approach of the ADR analysis is regarded acceptable.  
A total of 7 deaths have been reported throughout all trials and all were in the esketamine treatment 
groups. Three of the deaths were completed suicides. Given the severity of depression in the studied 
population and the high likelihood of suicide attempts, the latency to the last esketamine dose (4, 12 and 
20  days),  the  imbalance  in  exposure  between the  esketamine  group  and  control  group  (1045  vs  100 
patient-years of exposure, respectively) and assessment of the individual cases, it appears unlikely that 
these  were  related  to  esketamine,  but  rather  to  the  underlying  severe  condition.  Furthermore,  the 
suicides occurred during or after uncontrolled open-label treatment allowing no direct comparison with 
patients without esketamine treatment. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that there have been 
pharmacodynamic  changes  in  the  brain,  which  may  have  restored  or  facilitated  the  drive  to  commit 
suicide. Therefore, warnings regarding suicide risk have been included in the SmPC. Two deaths due to 
multiple injuries following a one-sided motorcycle accident and an accidental polytrauma were regarded 
as  not  related to esketamine.  The  relationship  between esketamine  and the  acute  respiratory/cardiac 
failure death or the myocardial infarction is deemed unlikely, due to the timeframe in which the event 
occurred and age/patient history. 
Overall reporting of serious adverse events across the phase 3 studies was low (< 10%) and had similar 
incidences in both esketamine and oral AD + intranasal placebo groups. Most of the reported SAEs were 
in the psychiatric disorders category and associated to exacerbation of the underlying disease. However, 
there was also a hypertensive emergency 2 min after esketamine application, which seems plausibly be 
related to study medication. A dose-relationship of SAEs could not be observed TEAEs leading to study 
drug  discontinuation,  dose  reduction  or  interruption  of  treatment  were  reported  at  low  rates  in  the 
short-term studies in both adult and elderly subjects. Across all studies, most frequently reported TEAEs 
in these categories were related to the underlying disease state under study (e.g. depression, anxiety) or 
transient events (e.g. dissociation, dizziness, nausea), which occurred shortly after dosing and resolved 
the same day. The rates of discontinuation of esketamine treatment due to TEAEs were generally highest 
early in the course of treatment (range 4.6-6.8%). In the Phase 3 short-term studies in both adult and 
elderly  subjects,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  at  higher  rates  in  the  esketamine 
compared with the placebo group. After longer-term exposure discontinuation rates were similar in the 
esketamine and placebo groups. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour.  Only  patients  with  no  or  mild  suicidal  ideation  (as  assessed  by 
C-SSRS and clinical judgment) were eligible for inclusion in the TRD studies since that level of suicidality 
is common for the disease severity of the studied population. All cases of completed suicide occurred in 
completed and ongoing open-label studies/study phases with no control group. The completed suicide 
rate of 0.29 per 100 patient years of treatment observed in the Phase 2/3 TRD studies does not appear 
higher  than  the  completed  suicide  rate  of  0.47  per  100  patient  years  of  treatment  reported  in  a 
meta-analysis of 30 TRD studies consisting of over 15,000 patients with TRD. Up to now, no trend could 
be observed that prolonged exposure to esketamine influences suicidality.  
Worsening  of  suicidality  and  suicidality-related  adverse  events  were  reported  infrequent.  In  the 
short-term studies there is a suggestion that, compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo, worsening of 
suicidality is lower in the esketamine groups. Interpretation is difficult as patients also initiated treatment 
with a new oral anti-depressant. The underlying disease may have also influenced events in some cases. 
A warning is included in the SmPC regarding suicide risk, which is supported.

Dissociation and perceptual changes.  
Dissociation  was  reported  more  often  in  patients  in  the  esketamine  groups  across  the  clinical 
development program. A distinctive pattern of dissociation was observed when monitoring the CADSS 
scores: onset shortly after dose administration, peak at 40 minutes post dose and resolvement at 1.5 
hours post dose. This is in line with the PK profile of esketamine. In both long-term studies it can be seen 
that CADSS scores decreased over time.  
Psychotic like symptoms & anxiety. Psychotic like symptoms were measured with the BRPS+. A small 
increase in score post baseline was more often reported in patients in the esketamine groups than in the 
oral AD + intranasal placebo groups. This transient increase follows the timing of the PK profile where it 
peaks  at  40  minutes  post  dose  and  is  mostly  resolved  at  1.5  hours  post  dose.  Rescue  antipsychotic 
medication was not needed. Based on additional analyses, there appears to be overlap between increases 
measured on the BRPS+ and the CADSS scales. Due to this overlap, it is more likely that any increase on 
the BRPS+ scale is related to dissociation, which may be transient, rather than psychosis. A warning has 
been included in the SmPC to be careful to treat patients with a history of psychosis, which is considered 
relevant.  
Anxiety was reported infrequently across the treatment groups and rescue anti anxiety medication was 
rarely needed.  
Hypomania and mania. Overall reporting of adverse events of mania was low during the study. Only 
two cases of mania were reported in the clinical development program. As there are uncertainties whether 
mania is to be attributed to esketamine treatment, to the newly initiated AD (duloxetine) treatment or to 
a  so  far  undiagnosed  bipolar  disorder,  a  warning  regarding  “Presence  or  history  of  mania  or  bipolar 
disorder” has been included in the SmPC.  
Dizziness  and  vertigo. Adverse events of this category were more commonly reported in any of the 
esketamine groups than in the oral AD + intranasal placebo group. Most of these events were mild or 
moderate  in  severity  and  occurred  and  resolved  on  the  same  day  of  dosing.  It  appears  that  patients 
developed tolerance to these effects over the course of treatment.   
Somnolence  and  sedation  Adverse  events  related  to  somnolence  and  sedation  were  more  often 
reported in the esketamine groups than in the oral AD + intranasal placebo groups across the clinical 
development program. Most events were reported on the same day of dosing. Like other CNS symptoms, 
sedative effects were typically resolved at 1.5 hours post dose. 
Cognition.  Ketamine  abuse  has  been  associated  with  neurotoxicity  and  subsequent  cognitive 
impairment.  Effects  on  cognition  seem  to  be  negligible  in  Phase  3  observations.  Across  the  studies, 
patients  appeared  to  perform  on  cognitive  tests  either  similar  to  baseline  or  improve.  The  observed 
improvement in  some  cases  is  in line  with  the  antidepressant  treatment  in  both  oral  AD  +  intranasal 
placebo  and  esketamine  groups.  These  results  of  the  Phase  1  TRD1005  study,  where  40  min  post 
esketamine  administration  a  transient  significant  decline  in  cognition,  an  increase  in  mental  effort 
required  to  complete  the  Cogstate  computerized  test  and  an  increase  in  sleepiness  was  observed  in 
healthy volunteers,  are in line and to be plausibly explained with early post-dose sedation and resolved 
by 2h after dosing. Repeated dosing of esketamine does not appear to lead to cognitive impairment in the 
current data set with the exception of the observed slowing in reaction time only in elderly subjects in 
both TRD3005 (short term) and TRD3004 (long term safety). Slowing of RT was not reflected in any of the 
other cognitive tests. Due to the absence of a control arm in study TRD3004 the clinical relevance is not 
clear at present. Published longitudinal studies of RT in elderly patients with MDD also presented slowing 
of reaction time. The interim report of the long-term study TRD3008 outlines a decline in performance on 
tests designed to assess psychomotor function and attention in the elderly.

Cognitive disorders and memory impairment (long-term use) have been included in the risk management 
plan  (RMP)  as  important  potential  risk,  to  be  further  investigated  via  the  ongoing  category  3  study 
54135419TRD3008 (the clinical study report is awaited by Q1 2023; annual analyses of safety results 
should also be provided until study completion). 
Interstitial  cystitis  and  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms.  Most  of  the  patients  that  experienced  a 
post-baseline increase in BPIC-SS score only had it at one time-point during the studies. No cases of 
esketamine-related interstitial cystitis were observed in any of the studies, including long-term results. In 
esketamine  treated  patients,  there  was  a  higher  rate  of  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (pollakiuria, 
dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and cystitis) than in placebo-treated patients. These symptoms 
were  typically  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity  and  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  with 
esketamine. These findings are reflected in the SmPC. Furthermore, as in clinical trials, there was a higher 
rate of lower urinary tract symptoms in esketamine nasal spray-treated patients than in placebo-treated 
patients,  Interstitial  cystitis  (long-term  use)  was  included  in  the  RMP  as  Important  potential  risk, 
requiring further evaluation via the category 3 (ongoing) study 54135419TRD3008. 
Nausea and vomiting. Nausea/vomiting was more commonly reported in patients receiving esketamine 
than in patients receiving oral AD + intranasal placebo. Compared to the induction phase, the rates of 
nausea and vomiting in the esketamine groups decreased in the optimization/maintenance phase. Thus 
some tolerance appears to be developed at chronic esketamine use.  
Abuse potential. The results of TRD1015 indicate that the abuse potential of intranasal administration of 
esketamine is similar to IV administration of ketamine. Furthermore, a number of TEAEs suggestive of 
Abuse Potential has been reported more commonly in the esketamine groups than in the placebo groups 
in the completed Studies. These were transient and self-limiting dizziness, somnolence, and dissociation 
and,  reported  at  lower  rates,  euphoric  mood,  confusional  state,  feeling  drunk  or  abnormal,  and 
hallucinations. Throughout the trials, however, cases of drug abuse or drug seeking behaviour have not 
been  observed.  Given  the  chronic  nature  of  the  treatment  more  longitudinal  data  is  needed  to  fully 
evaluate the abuse potential of esketamine. 
Drug  abuse  is  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  identified  risk  for  esketamine  nasal  spray.  The 
following routine and additional risk minimisation measures (RMMs) are deemed necessary to prevent / 
minimise such safety concern. 
The abuse potential of esketamine nasal spray and its mitigation are addressed, first of all, in the EU 
product information (EU PI) (ie, Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] and Package Leaflet [PL]) 
and include the following concepts: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Esketamine nasal spray is administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional. 
The recommended dosing of esketamine nasal spray is twice weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 
weekly  or  every-other-week  dosing  for  patients  with  a  favorable  clinical  response.  During 
longer-term treatment, physicians are recommended to individualize the dosing frequency to the 
lowest  frequency  needed  to  maintain  the  patient’s  clinical  response  and  to  perform  periodic 
re-evaluation of patients to determine the need for continued treatment.  
Individuals  with  a  history of  drug  abuse  or  dependence  may  be  at  greater risk  for  abuse  and 
misuse of esketamine nasal spray. Physicians are advised to assess individuals prior to treatment 
for a history of substance use disorder and to monitor for signs of abuse or dependence. 
Esketamine nasal spray is designed with the following features to deter abuse (and misuse):

The drug product is contained in a Type I glass vial sealed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper. The 
filled and stoppered vial is seated into a container holder assembled into a manually activated 
nasal spray device. The device is difficult to disassemble due to interlocking design features of the 
actuator subassembly. Attempts to break open the device damage the vial and the contents are 
lost. The force required to pull the device apart is at least 60 Newtons (~13 pounds). If the device 
is taken apart, the stoppered vial provides an additional challenge to disassembly, as it is very 
difficult to pull the stopper out. Breaking the vial instead results in loss of the contents. 
The product is supplied as a single-use device containing a total of 32.3 mg of esketamine HCl 
(equivalent to 28 mg of esketamine). When manually actuated, the device dispenses 2 individual 
sprays; no sprays remain after the second spray is actuated. 
The nasal spray device has a nominal fill volume of 230 μL and a delivery volume of 200 μL. The 
average measured residual volume left in the nasal spray device after actuation is ~30μL (4 mg 
base). 
•  Legal  controls  (e.g.,  restrictions  on  storage  and  prescribing  including  special  and  restricted 
medical prescription with categorization at the Member State level) will be in place according to 
local legal requirements in the majority of Member States (MS) where esketamine is currently 
scheduled,  either  directly  or  indirectly  due  to  its  chemical  relationship  to  ketamine.  In  these 
Member States (MS), it is proposed that the scheduling class should be the same as that which 
applies  already  to  any  ketamine-  or  esketamine-containing  medicinal  product.  The  following 
recommendations  minimize  the  risk  of  abuse,  diversion  and  misuse.  Any  unused  medicinal 
product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local  requirements.  All 
treatment should be administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional (HCP) 
and signs of abuse or dependence should be carefully monitored. 
•  No unsupervised administration of the product is allowed.  
Furthermore, a controlled access program should be implemented, as key element to ensure esketamine 
nasal spray is dispensed to the healthcare settings where administration takes place, as agreed at the 
Member State level, based on local legal requirements and/or local healthcare systems. 
A  HCP  Guide  and  a  Patient  Guide  containing  key  messages  regarding  product  administration  and  the 
potential for abuse and dependence are also agreed as additional RMMs.  
Withdrawal and rebound. There was no evidence suggestive of a distinct withdrawal syndrome after 
cessation  of  treatment  with  esketamine  assessed  by  the  PWC-20  (Physician  Withdrawal  Checklist). 
Taking into consideration the half-life of esketamine of 7 to 12 hours, with twice-a-week or lower dosing 
frequency,  circulating  levels  of  esketamine  are  not  expected  to  accumulate  and  the  occurrence  of  a 
withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation of nasal esketamine is unlikely. 
Cardiovascular  safety.  TEAEs  of  increased  blood  pressure  and  increased  heart  rate  were  generally 
transient and mild or moderate in severity. Serious AEs were reported in isolated cases. Blood pressure 
increases occurred shortly after esketamine administration, reaching maximum within 40 minutes, at the 
time of peak plasma esketamine levels, and generally returning to values close to pre-treatment within 
1.5 hours after administration. Increases of blood pressure were reported more frequently in patients 
with a history of hypertension and in elderly subjects. The presented findings are in accordance with the 
already  known  cardiovascular  ADR-profile  of  esketamine.  Exposure-response  PK/PD  models  were 
developed to describe the relationship between SBP and DBP and esketamine plasma concentration. 
Cardiovascular compromised individuals or those with poorly controlled hypertension were excluded from 
the clinical studies, however those with cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes etc.) 
could participate in the studies Subgroup analyses revealed that cardiovascular-related adverse events 
occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  with  CV  risk  factors.  It  was  agreed  that  for  administration  of 
esketamine  in  patients  with  unstable  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  conditions,  as  a  precautionary

measure, resuscitation equipment and health care professionals trained in CPR should be available at the 
administration site. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in ECG findings across the Phase 2 and 3 studies, including 
QTc interval or PR Interval, in agreement with the findings of the Phase 1 thorough QTc study in healthy 
subjects.  
Overall,  due to  the  transient  and  self-limiting  nature  of  the  cardiovascular  effects  observed  in  clinical 
trials, the overall impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product is considered low; however, the impact 
on an individual patient may be significant. The SmPC and PL, as well as the Healthcare Professional Guide 
and Patient Guide, provide information to the prescriber and the patient on how to manage the risk. A 
checklist for readiness to leave will be provided to aid   HCP  in  determining  when  a  patient  is  deemed 
stable and should safely be allowed to return home following esketamine nasal spray administration. 
Nasal tolerability The active substance concentration of 140 mg/mL resulted in a high osmolality of the 
solution  (appr.  1050  mOsm/kg).  The  effect  of  the  osmotic  pressure  on  the  nasal  irritation  was 
investigated throughout clinical studies and considered acceptable. Although most subjects did not report 
any nasal tolerability symptoms or significant effects on the sense of smell, nasal discomfort was reported 
as a common and dysgeusia as a very common ADR. Reported symptoms were mild to moderate. Long 
term exposure had no impact on nasal tolerability or the sense of smell.  
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  laboratory  analytes  (hematology,  chemistry,  urinalysis 
parameters) from baseline were observed in any of the completed Phase 2 and 3 TRD studies, there were 
only isolated cases in which TEAEs were associated with abnormal laboratory results leading infrequently 
to discontinuation.  
There were no cases of respiratory depression among esketamine-treated subjects across the studies, 
and no subject required cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other medical interventions.  
No effect on body weight could be observed. 
Esketamine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic clearance is required for a termination of the clinical 
effects. There are preclinical findings suggestive of hepatotoxicity. A number of cases of liver damage 
(bile duct dilatation and hepatic enzymes elevation) have been reported in literature related to (off-label) 
long-term  ketamine  use.  ALT/AST  elevations  observed  in  the  Phase  3  studies  were  primarily 
asymptomatic, transient and resolved spontaneously without worsening while treatment with esketamine 
and oral AD continued, no persistent increases in liver transaminases were observed and no cases met 
the criteria for severe drug-induced hepatocellular injury. Results of TRD1011 show increases in Cmax 
and AUC in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and the reported rates of TEAEs were higher in 
patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  in  comparison  with  subjects  with  normal  liver 
function (37.5% vs 25%).  
Although it is agreed that the differences to the placebo + AD group are minor and that the relationship 
to esketamine is difficult to determine due to the novel oral AD started at the same time, it is considered 
that the totality of the findings justify a warning in section 4.4 for patients with severe hepatic impairment 
unless there is new safety data generated in this patient group.  
So far, the available long-term data from the interim-analysis of TRD3008 do not suggest a trend for 
hepatic events/liver function disturbances over time.  
There  have  been  no  reported  cases  of  overdose  with  esketamine  in  any  of  the  clinical  studies.  The 
maximum single dose tested was 112 mg with a higher incidence of TEAEs compared to lower doses. The 
potential for overdosage by patients seems to be low, because esketamine has to be administered in the 
Assessment report

presence of health care professionals. Nevertheless, it is reflected in the SmPC that above the 25-fold 
usual  anaesthetic  dose,  life-threatening  symptoms  are  expected.  Clinical  symptoms  are  described  as 
convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory arrest.  
Pharmacokinetic differences have been described in the elderly population (increase of Cmax and AUC in 
comparison to younger adults). This was reflected by the lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine 
administered to the elderly subjects included in TRD3005. No clinically meaningful differences were 
described between any of the subgroups defined by age from the presented data from trial TRD3005 no 
clear dosing difference could be observed for TEAEs in the elderly. Data from the interim report of the 
ongoing trial TRD3008 show that the incidences of AEs overall and by SOC were generally similar for 
patients <65 years and for patients ≥ 65 years. However, it has to be taken into account that only a 
limited number of patients ≥ 65 years (n=14) has been included. 
No clinical meaningful differences in frequencies or pattern of TEAEs could be observed for different sexes 
or  different  races  in  the  Phase  3  trials.  Subjects  from  Europe,  North  America and  other  regions  were 
included in the trials at various frequencies. As pharmacokinetic observations revealed a higher exposure 
in Japanese subjects (Please refer also to the Pharmacology Assessment Report), a conservative dosing 
approach  is  recommended  in  this  patient  population  unless  data  from  the  ongoing  study  TRD2005  in 
Japanese subjects provide further information on safety and dose-response (expected 2nd half 2020).  
The use of esketamine is not recommended in pregnant women and these subjects were excluded from 
the  clinical  trials.  There  were  18  pregnancies  during  the  clinical  development  program  exposed  to 
esketamine. Outcomes included 2 ectopic pregnancies, 4 spontaneous abortions, 2 elective abortions, all 
assessed  as  not  related  to  esketamine  administration  by  the  sponsor  due  to  risk  factors  including 
advanced maternal age, obesity, previous history of spontaneous abortion, and sterilization procedure 
(for the cases of ectopic pregnancy). 3 pregnancies are described as unknown outcome. 3 healthy babies 
were reported in partners of male subjects who were exposed to esketamine. No congenital anomalies 
were reported. Non-clinical studies have shown that racemic ketamine induced lower birth weight and can 
also induce neurotoxicity in juvenile animals. A similar risk with esketamine cannot be excluded.  
Changes in the activity of CYP enzymes (CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) are expected to influence the oral 
bioavailability of esketamine, however, due to nasal administration, where approximately half of the dose 
is absorbed via nasal mucosa avoiding the first-pass metabolism in the liver, nasal esketamine is 
expected to have a low propensity to pharmacokinetic interactions.  
A post-hoc analysis of esketamine exposure under co-medication of oral antidepressant (ie, duloxetine, 
escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine) based on a Pop PK model revealed no clinically relevant 
interaction potential. PB PK modeling and simulation revealed that no effect of esketamine on ethinyl 
estradiol plasma concentrations is expected. 
Pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted  by  the  Applicant.  Since  potential 
pharmacodynamic 
interactions  (e.g. 
increasing  cardiovascular  ADRs 
like  hypertension  with 
psychostimulants and other substances) are described for other esketamine products, these are outlined 
also in the SPC for nasal esketamine. 
Precautionary measures, such as food restriction up to 2 hours before drug administration and post-dose 
close observation under the supervision of a healthcare professional have to be ensured.  
Taking into account that esketamine has the potential to cause sedation, dizziness and hypertension, 
patients  have  to  be  monitored  adequately  in  the  immediate  post-dose  period.  Measures  of  post-dose 
observation, including concrete timelines, are specified in the product information (e.g. blood pressure, 
sedation).  As  PK  considerations  do  not  suggest  an  anaesthetic  effect  and  no  case  of  respiratory 
depression  was  detected  throughout  the  trial  programme  in  78,244  dosing  sessions  or  in  the 
post-marketing  experience  with  11,260  dosing  sessions  in  the  USA,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the

immediate availability of resuscitation equipment and supportive ventilation as well as the availability of 
adequately  CPR  trained  staff  at  the  administration  site  is  not  regarded  as  mandatory  for  all  patients. 
However, based on the PRAC recommendation and further discussion within the Committee and with the 
company, it was deemed necessary to have this in place for at risk patients (i.e. patients with clinically 
significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions). 
Particular attention should be given to elderly patients, considering they are more prone to injury.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Over the proposed therapeutic dose range most TEAEs occur shortly after dosing when patients will be 
under  the  supervision  of  a  HCP  and  are  transient  with  same  day  resolution.  Generally,  TEAEs  were 
expected based on the pharmacological profile and the already known ADR profile of esketamine solution 
for injection.  
The  most  common  ADRs  for  nasal  esketamine  in  TRD  patients  were  dissociation,  dizziness,  nausea, 
sedation, headache, vertigo, dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia, increased blood pressure, anxiety and vomiting. 
Esketamine has a potential for abuse.  
The use of esketamine as a treatment for depression is novel. Treatment duration is expected to be at 
least over 6 months. Up to now long term data does not suggest a trend over time in how intranasal 
esketamine affects suicidality, cognition and interstitial cystitis/lower urinary tract symptoms as well as 
renal and hepatic adverse reactions in patients with TRD.  
Because  of  the  possibility  of  sedation,  dissociative  symptoms  and  hypertension,  patients  must  be 
monitored  by  a  healthcare  professional  at  each  treatment  session,  followed  by  an  assessment  to 
determine when the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting.   
Taking into account the safety findings of the clinical trial program, intranasal administration of 
esketamine in the target population with TRD at doses of 56 or 84 mg up to twice weekly was deemed to 
have an acceptable safety profile under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  
With regard to the general requirement of the presence of a specifically CPR-trained physician and 
resuscitation equipment at the administration site, the CHMP reviewed the available evidence and agreed 
that the applicant’s justification for omitting the requirement of resuscitation equipment for all patients 
seemed sound as:

strict, would restrict administration to a hospital setting and may prevent many TRD patients from 
receiving treatment with nasal esketamine.  
Thereby a compromise was agreed to restrict the intensified monitoring/treatment conditions to patients 
at risk with clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions, SPRAVATO should be 
administered in a clinical setting where equipment for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and staff trained in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available.   
Prior to the launch of SPRAVATO in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must agree about the content and format of the educational materials (EM) and the controlled 
access programme (CAP), including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where SPRAVATO is marketed a CAP is implemented to 
prevent/minimise the important identified risk of Drug abuse.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers the following additional pharmacovigilance activities necessary to 
address issues related to safety: 
•  A survey to assess the effectiveness of the additional risk minimisations measures  
(category 3):  To assess the effectiveness of the additional risk minimisation materials (i.e. HCP 
guide and checklist for readiness to leave, patient guide). 
•  An open-label long term extension safety study of intranasal esketamine in TRD (ongoing, 
category 3): To assess the long-term safety (> 1 year) of esketamine nasal spray in subjects with 
TRD, with special attention to the following: Potential long-term effects on cognitive function; 
TEAEs, including TEAEs of special interest; post dose effects on heart rate, blood pressure, 
respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation; Potential effects on suicidal ideation/behaviour; 
interstitial cystitis 
•  A planned pregnancy registry for Psychiatric medications such as antidepressant, including 
esketamine.  To further characterize the impact of the missing information of Use during 
pregnancy on the safety profile of esketamine nasal spray. Periodic safety assessments of data 
will be conducted from a US pregnancy registry for psychiatric medications, including 
antidepressants.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.6 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the different indication, dosing, route of administration, administration setting and target 
patient population as highlighted by the new ATC code as an antidepressant instead of general 
anaesthetics, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Spravato is needed, as 
it cannot follow the already existing entry for esketamine. The requirements for submission of periodic 
safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP 
Opinion. The applicant did not request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth 
date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock 
Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spravato (esketamine) is included in the 
Assessment report

additional monitoring list since it has measures for ensuring the safe use of the medicinal product included 
in the risk management system and it has conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective 
use of the medicinal product. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
According to WHO, depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide. More than 300 
million people are now living with depression, an increase of more than 18% between 2005 and 2015. 
According to facts and figures from WHO, each year, 25% of the population suffer from depression or 
anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders account for 19.5% of the burden of disease in the European 
Region, and 26% in European Union (EU) countries. These disorders account for up to 40% of years lived 
with disability, with depression as the main cause and up to 50% of chronic sick leaves are due to 
depression/anxiety.  
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of global disease burden and affects about 
15 % of the general population. MDD is not a benign disorder, it is associated with substantial 
psychosocial dysfunction and high individual mental strain as well as with excess morbidity and mortality 
- the risk of suicide is considerable.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Although there are many oral antidepressant (AD) pharmacotherapies available for use worldwide, all of 
these agents act primarily by modulating the same pathway (monoaminergic system) and require several 
weeks before a full clinical effect on depression symptoms is evident. The conventional treatments over 
the past 50 years have targeted monoamine neurotransmitters, including selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. 
There are several publications discussing the definition and potential treatments of TRD. Quetiapine 
prolonged released tablets (e.g. Seroquel XR) are licensed as add-on treatment of major depressive 
episodes in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had a sub-optimal response to 
antidepressant monotherapy; however, the population was differently defined in comparison to a 
treatment-resistant population.  
While an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (Symbyax®) has been approved only in the USA, there is 
currently no medicinal product specifically authorized for the treatment of TRD in Europe. In the European 
guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression 
(EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2), the difficulties even in the conceptual elaboration and definition of 
clear criteria for incomplete response and TRD are acknowledged together with the unavailability of 
specifically approved treatments for this condition. 
Despite the many treatment options currently available for MDD, a relevant proportion of patients, up to 
one third, do not adequately respond to treatment, and up to 20% are considered non-responders, even 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 165/166 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if there is good compliance and the treatment has been taken long enough with an adequate dosage. 
Therefore, a high unmet medical need for treatment-resistant depression has been recognised.   
Nasal esketamine may address this unmet medical need. The proposed therapeutic indication is:  
SPRAVATO, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant Major 
Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants in 
the current moderate to severe depressive episode (see section 5.1). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A number of studies have been submitted to support the proposed indication for the treatment of TRD 
with the proposed flexible dosing regimen. This application includes results from (1) a comprehensive 
clinical pharmacology program in healthy volunteers and special populations to fully characterize the 
product’s pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, including Phase 2 studies with IV 
esketamine and ketamine; (2) a Phase 2 dose-response study in adults with TRD; (3) a Phase 2 
proof-of-concept (PoC) study in the related condition of MDSI. The Applicant has also completed 5 Phase 
3 studies: three short term (4-week) double-blind randomised parallel group studies (TRD3001, 
TRD3002) including one study in the elderly (TRD3005), comparing esketamine plus an oral 
antidepressant with an oral antidepressant plus nasal placebo, a double-blind relapse prevention study 
(3003), and an open-label long term safety and efficacy study (TRD3004). As such, the clinical 
development program can be considered as comprehensive and conforming to the requirements of the EU 
adopted Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression 
(EMA/CHMP/185423/2010 Rev. 2, 30 May 2013). 
The Applicant has generally followed the recommendations of the Scientific Advices provided by EMA or 
National Agencies. 
Inclusion criteria were adequate to define a treatment-resistant population. A high percentage of patients 
in the short term studies (~89.4% and 89.5% in TRD3001 and ~92.1% in TRD3002 in the Esketamine + 
Oral AD group) had treatment failures with 2 or more specific antidepressant medications and a high 
percentage (~74% and 78% in TRD3001 and ~80% in TRD3002 in the Esketamine + Oral AD group) had 
treatment failures with 2 or more classes of antidepressant medications. For the prior oral 
antidepressants in the pooled studies TRD3002 and TRD3001, it is noted that a small percentage ~10% 
(9.7% for the esketamine + oral AD and 11.3% for oral AD + intranasal placebo) had only one treatment 
failure. For the esketamine + oral AD group (N=343) 53.7% had 2 treatment failures, 25.2% had 3 
treatment failures, 8.5% had 4 treatment failures and 2.9% had 5 treatment failures or more. In addition, 
one treatment failure was evaluated prospectively. The various analyses provided for the population 
selected to be included in the studies are further reassuring that these patients indeed belonged to the 
TRD spectrum.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint in all short-term studies was the difference for the change in the MADRS total score 
from Baseline to Day 28 or endpoint between esketamine + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo, 
which is an acceptable endpoint and commonly used in studies in depression. 
Study TRD3002 is considered a successful study since statistically significant and clinically relevant 
results in the primary endpoint were achieved (demonstrating a difference between groups greater than 
2 points). The estimated treatment effect for esketamine flexible dosing (56 or 84 mg) + oral AD 
compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo treatment was -3.5 (-6.70; -0.27, 2-sided p=0.034) by 
ANCOVA BOCF analysis. In study TRD3001, the difference in the mean change in MADRS total score from 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 166/167 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline to day 28, between esketamine 56mg + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo was -4.3, 
without reaching statistical significance.    
The onset of clinical response based on MADRS total score by Day 2 (24 hours) Fisher’s Exact test did not 
achieve statistical significance, but provided some evidence for early, non-significant effect, which might 
be considered as an advantage for an antidepressant treatment. 
A consistent effect in the primary endpoint was observed across pivotal studies and this was supported by 
responder and remitter rates. In study TRD3003, the mean change in MADRS total score from baseline 
(maintenance phase) to endpoint was 7.5 in the oral AD + esketamine group and 12.5 in the oral AD + 
intranasal placebo group in stable remitters and 4.4 versus 11.4 in stable responders. The differences in 
the LS means of the mean change in MADRS in Stable Remitters as well as in stable Responders between 
esketamine +Oral AD versus oral AD +intranasal placebo were statistically significant and provided 
reassurance for the maintenance of effect (-5.2; p=0.005 and -7.4; p <0.001 respectively).   
Relapse proportion differences of −24.0% (95% CI: −35.2%; −10.7%) after 12 weeks and −14.0% 
(95% CI: −28.1%; 2.7%) after ~20 weeks were observed in favour of the oral AD + esketamine group.  
The relapse proportion difference in stable responders after 12 weeks was -25.5% (95% CI: −44.3%; 
−12.5%) and −34.7% (−53.5%; −21.4%) after ~20 weeks in favour of the oral AD + esketamine group 
Consistent findings with a trend in favour of esketamine + oral AD were also observed in an older 
population (>65 years of age) (TRD3005). In TRD3005, the estimated treatment difference in the change 
of MADRS (95% CI) of -3.6 (-7.20; +0.07) by MMRM and -3.6 (-7.16; -0.03) by ANCOVA LOCF analysis 
methods for esketamine + oral AD over oral AD + intranasal placebo showed a trend in favour of 
esketamine + oral AD without reaching statistical significance (LOCF 1-sided p=0.026). 
In the open-label long term safety study TRD3004 non-responders assessed retrospectively or from study 
TRD3005 who completed the 4 weeks induction phase showed an improvement in MADRS of      -16.4 and 
then proceeded to the optimisation/maintenance phase for another 48 weeks during which period the low 
MADRS total score was maintained (+0.3). Despite the fact that this study aimed to provide safety data, 
it also provided some degree of reassurance for the maintenance of the antidepressant effect of 
esketamine administered concomitantly with an oral antidepressant. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties about the favourable effects consist of the following: 
In study TRD3001, the difference in the mean change (SD) in MADRS) total score from baseline to day 28, 
between esketamine 84mg + oral AD and oral AD + intranasal placebo did not reach statistical 
significance, despite showing a trend in favour of the active treatment. Furthermore, the estimated 
difference (95% CI) for the 56 mg dose could not be formally tested in the hierarchical testing procedure 
because the 84mg dose failed to reach statistical significance.  
In all studies, esketamine was added on to an SSRI or an SNRI. The data on efficacy cannot simply be 
extrapolated to other antidepressants, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants or MAOIS, which were excluded in 
the phase 3 studies. The final proposed SmPC therefore specifies that esketamine can be added to an 
SSRI or SNRI.  
MMRM was the predefined primary analysis but was not endorsed by CHMP. ANCOVA (BOCF) is 
considered the most relevant method of analysis and was recommended in the CHMP scientific advice as 
a possibility for missing data imputation. It can be considered as a conservative analysis in accordance 
with the estimand of primary regulatory interest because BOCF assumes that all benefits potentially 
achieved from treatment are lost upon drug discontinuation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 167/168 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Despite a favourable trend for esketamine in older patients (≥65 years of age), it should be noted that the 
subgroup of patients ≥75 years did not show any treatment benefit. However, the latter group was too 
small to draw definite conclusions.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Drug abuse potential 
The potential for drug abuse is well known for ketamine and esketamine. Although cases of drug abuse 
have not been observed in the clinical studies, a number of TEAEs suggestive of Abuse Potential have 
been reported commonly throughout the trials with intranasal esketamine administration. These were 
transient and self-limiting such as dizziness, somnolence, and dissociation and, reported at lower rates, 
euphoric mood, confusional state, feeling drunk or abnormal, and hallucinations. Precautionary measures 
for  the  drug  supply  have  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  patients  do  not  have  the  possibility  to  store  the 
medicinal product. 
Transient dissociative/perceptual changes 
Across completed Phase 2 and 3 studies, the most common psychological effects of esketamine have 
been dissociative/ perceptual changes (including distortion of time and space and illusions), derealization 
and depersonalization, which is in accordance with the already known ADR-profile of esketamine.  The 
dissociative/ perceptual changes had an onset shortly after the start of the dose, peaked by 40 minutes 
post-dose and typically resolved by 1.5 hours post-dose. Dissociative/perceptual changes were reported 
as adverse events at a rate of 12.5-27.6% across trials, primarily mild or moderate in severity, transient 
and self-limited.  Dissociation was reported as severe in intensity at the incidence of less than 4% across 
studies,  was  not  considered  serious  for  any  subjects  and  rarely  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug. 
Transient dissociative/perceptual changes were more pronounced in subjects receiving higher doses of 
esketamine. Patients have to be monitored for signs of dissociation after drug administration. 
Cardiovascular effects (transient increase in blood pressure) 
Transient mild to moderate increases in SBP and DBP were observed in Phase 2 and 3 studies shortly after 
esketamine  administration,  reaching  a  maximum  within  40  minutes  (at  the  time  of  peak  plasma 
esketamine  levels)  and  generally  returning  to  values  close  to  pretreatment  within  1.5  hours  after 
administration.  In  the  oral  AD  +  intranasal  placebo  group,  mean  BP  pressure  values  remained  fairly 
constant across predose and postdose timepoints. The proportion of subjects with markedly abnormal BP 
elevation (SBP to ≥180 mm Hg or DBP to ≥110 mm Hg, i.e. acute hypertension) ranged from 2.0% to 
11.1% in the esketamine + oral AD treatment group across studies/phases. These elevations were reported 
at higher rates in subjects with a history of hypertension than those without and at a higher rate in elderly 
subjects vs. younger adults: 11.1% vs. 4.9% in the short-term studies.  
Somnolence and Sedation 
Across  all  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  sedation  was  one  of  the  most  common  effects  associated  with 
esketamine treatment and reported more often than in the oral AD+placebo group. TEAEs of somnolence 
(12.1-21.1%) and sedation (4.2-10.1%) were primarily mild or moderate in severity, occurred on the day 
of intranasal dosing and resolved spontaneously the same day, with the median duration under 2 hours 
across dosing sessions. These TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in isolated cases and reported as a 
SAE in only 1 subject across all Phase 2 and 3 studies. Rates of TEAEs of somnolence were relatively 
stable over time during longer-term treatment. 
For older patients, a careful monitoring statement should be introduced in the SmPC due to a greater risk 
of falling once mobilised.

Urinary tract adverse effects 
Reports from the literature suggest that chronic recreational ketamine abuse may be associated with the 
emergence of a new bladder pain syndrome, ulcerative cystitis.  
No cases of interstitial cystitis or ulcerative cystitis were reported in the clinical programme with nasal 
esketamine.  However,  pollakiuria  was  commonly  reported.  Urinary  tract  symptoms,  in  general,  were 
reversible. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Esketamine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic clearance is required for a termination of the clinical 
effects. There are preclinical findings suggestive of hepatotoxicity. A number of cases of liver damage 
(bile  duct  dilatation  and  hepatic  enzymes  elevation)  have  been  reported  in  the  literature  related  to 
(off-label) long-term ketamine use.  
Elevations in ALT/AST >3 x ULN were reported at low rates across studies, were primarily asymptomatic, 
transient, and resolved spontaneously while treatment with esketamine and oral AD continued.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Interstitial cystitis and hepatotoxicity have been reported in the literature in cases with long-term 
off-label use of ketamine, but not throughout the clinical trial programme for intranasal esketamine. With 
the limited sample size for long-term treatment, rare or very rare ADRs occurring after long-term 
treatment cannot be reliably detected.  
In all studies, esketamine was added on to an SSRI or an SNRI. Safety in co-administration with TCAs is 
insufficiently characterized. 
A total of 3 completed suicides were reported with esketamine compared to none with placebo. However, 
these suicides occurred in the in open-label studies/study phases with no control group allowing no direct 
comparison with patients without eseketmine treatment. Given the high likelihood of suicide attempts in 
the studied population, the latency to the last esketamine dose (20, 12 and 4 days), the imbalance in 
exposure between the esketamine group and control group (1045 vs 100 patient-years of exposure, 
respectively) and assessment of the individual cases, it appears unlikely that these were related to 
esketamine, but rather to the underlying severe condition.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The study population is considered representative TRD patients. The careful selection of the appropriate 
population is of primary importance in order for depressed patients to be part of the definition of 
treatment-resistant depression. To this effect, the Applicant, in addition to the retrospective 
demonstration of antidepressant treatment failure, included a screening/prospective observational phase 
in the short term DB phase 3 studies where the treatment failure was shown prospectively prior to the 
patients entering the double induction phase. This is considered appropriate and, for some experts in the 
field of depression, could be sufficient as a unique demonstration of treatment resistance.

The endpoints (primary and secondary) used for the evaluation of the efficacy of esketamine in TRD are 
considered reliable, validated, referenced in treatment and development guidelines and used throughout 
many years in the clinical practice and hence appropriate. 
In the pivotal study TRD3002 an effect size which exceeded the usually accepted clinically relevant 
difference of 2 points in MADRS total score was observed. The placebo-adjusted effect size of -3.5 or   -4.3 
difference in the change from baseline to 4 weeks/Endpoint in the MADRS total score observed in the 
short term DB phase 3 studies can therefore be considered as clearly clinically relevant. Similar 
supportive results were observed in study TRD3001. 
In addition, similar effect sizes have been observed in the various phase 2 clinical studies for esketamine 
indicating consistency of the antidepressant effect across studies performed at various sites in various 
countries. 
The relapse prevention study (as required by the EU Depression Guideline) showed that the 
antidepressant effect is maintained over time. Patients receiving esketamine on top of their oral AD 
treatment remained in remission for a longer period of time compared to patients receiving placebo on top 
of their oral AD.  
Supportive evidence for the maintenance of effect has also been provided by the open-label long-term 
safety study.    
Concerns regarding the concomitant initiation of two novel therapies (new oral AD + esketamine) in the 
clinical trials were expressed during the scientific advice procedures. In addition, esketamine has not 
been evaluated in monotherapy. However, it is considered unethical for patients with TRD to be left 
without any antidepressant treatment (which would have been the case in placebo-controlled 
monotherapy studies) or on a treatment that has not been sufficiently effective.   
The safety profile derived from the clinical trial programme appears acceptable. 
The most relevant safety issues are the immediate transient post-dose dissociative /perceptual changes, 
cardiovascular effects (transient increase in blood pressure) and somnolence and sedation, which require 
a close patient observation at least during the first two hours after intranasal esketamine application. 
Although  these  TEAEs  were  generally  of  mild  to  moderate  severity,  more  severe  cases  may  require 
immediate  intervention  (e.g.  hypertensive  emergency).  Therefore,  adequate  monitoring  has  to  be 
ensured.  In  patients  with cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  conditions  not  tolerating  blood  pressure 
increases, treatment is contraindicated. Somnolence /sedation could potentially have an influence on the 
ability to drive or use machinery and increase the risk of falls or dangerous behaviour in particular in case 
of early discharge. 
Throughout the clinical trials, only rare cases led to treatment withdrawals. The fact that patients have to 
stay for at least 2 h under the observation of an HCP and are not allowed to drive or use machinery until 
the next day is clearly a burden of this new treatment option for TRD. 
With regard to the initial general requirement of the presence of a specifically CPR-trained physician and 
resuscitation equipment at the administration site, the CHMP reviewed the available evidence and agreed 
that the applicant’s justification for omitting the requirement of resuscitation equipment seemed sound.

Two anaesthesiological experts (from NL and DE) support the applicant’s position  
Labelling for other anaesthetics used at subanaesthetic doses (e.g. Xyrem, Clonazepam, Zubsolv) 
does not require resuscitation equipment 
It was felt that the requirement for a full-time presence of a physician with CPR training during the 
Spravato administration sessions and availability of resuscitation equipment for all patients may be overly 
strict, would restrict administration to a hospital setting and may prevent many TRD patients from 
receiving treatment with nasal esketamine. A compromise was agreed to restrict the intensified 
monitoring/treatment conditions to patients with unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions.  
However, all patients must be adequately monitored by a healthcare professional for possible 
development of sedation, dissociation symptoms and hypertension at each administration session. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Short-  and  long-term  efficacy  of  esketamine  on  top  of  an  SSRI  or  SNRI  in  TRD  patients  has  been 
established. The results from at least one short term randomised DB study confirmed the antidepressant 
efficacy of esketamine + oral AD compared to oral AD + intranasal placebo, despite innovative design 
features in the studies. Two more short-term studies showed trends in favour of esketamine + oral AD 
versus oral AD + intranasal placebo. Secondary endpoints and subgroup analysis were supportive of the 
positive results. Demonstration of maintenance of the antidepressant effect was achieved via a relapse 
prevention  study  of  adequate  duration.  Furthermore,  supportive  efficacy  data  were  observed  in  an 
open-label  long  term  mainly  safety  study.  As  such,  and  further  to  clarifications  provided,  the  clinical 
program  can  be  considered  comprehensive  for  intranasal  esketamine  as  an  adjunctive  treatment 
administered concomitantly with a SSRI or SNRI. Based  on  the  totality  of  the submitted  data,  including 
significant  and  clinically  relevant  differences  from  placebo  and  clear  trends  in  line  with  the  significant 
results, the product is considered efficacious.  
The Applicant has agreed to modify the therapeutic indication in TRD to best reflect the population and 
treatments studied: 
SPRAVATO,  in  combination  with  a  SSRI  or  SNRI,  is  indicated  for  adults  with  treatment-resistant 
Major Depressive Disorder, who  have  not  responded  to  at  least  two  different  treatments  with 
antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode. 
It  should  be  pointed  out  that  with  the  decision  to  prescribe  Spravato  should  be  determined  by  a 
psychiatrist and a specific protocol is required to inform prescribers about the drug distribution system 
across the various Member States, the minimum requirements available at the site, how the monitoring 
will take place, who will perform the monitoring and a checklist evaluating when a patient is deemed 
stable enough to be discharged should be also included.   
Overall, the short-term safety profile of esketamine is sufficiently characterized. Nasal application has an 
acceptable tolerability with manageable risks when applied under the supervision of an HCP. An 
observation of the patient in the immediate post-application period is required, since transient 
dissociative disorders, sedation and elevated blood pressure, usually of mild to moderate severity, are 
described. The available long term safety data do not suggest a trend over time for effects on cognition, 
suicidality, and lower urinary tract symptoms, as well as renal and hepatic adverse reactions.  
However, given that esketamine is a novel treatment for depression and the safety study TRD3008 is still 
ongoing, B/R should be further evaluated and subsequently updated when new data becomes available. 
The so far generated safety data from the short-term studies indicate that most adverse events are 
transient in nature and could be managed by careful monitoring of the patient. Throughout treatment 
Assessment report

Page 172/173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with intranasal esketamine the potential for abuse has to be taken into consideration, especially in 
vulnerable subjects. 
Although there was no signal of an increased risk of abuse in the clinical studies, emphasis was placed in 
the SmPC that esketamine should be initiated by a psychiatrist and can only be administered in a clinical 
setting under supervision. In addition, a controlled accesses programme must be implemented nationally. 
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Spravato 
On 31 October and 10 November 2019, the CHMP received, after the adoption of the CHMP positive 
opinion, correspondences from 2 groups of experts (hereinafter referred to as “third parties”) which 
expressed concerns about the efficacy and safety profile of Spravato.    
The CHMP considered those interventions and concluded that the arguments put forward by both 
third-parties did not impact the CHMP conclusions. However, a revised opinion was adopted by the CHMP 
on 21 November 2019 in order to provide further clarifications in relation to the clinical safety and the 
benefit-risk balance sections.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Spravato is favourable in the following indication: 
Spravato, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant Major 
Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants in 
the current moderate to severe depressive episode.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to special and restricted medical prescription.

in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of SPRAVATO in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must  agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  materials  (EM)  and  the  controlled 
access  programme  (CAP),  including  communication  media,  distribution  modalities,  and  any  other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The  MAH  shall  ensure  that  in  each  MS  where  SPRAVATO  is  marketed  a  CAP  is  implemented  to 
prevent/minimise the important identified risk of Drug abuse.  
SPRAVATO is intended to be self-administered by the patient under direct Healthcare Professional (HCP) 
supervision  and  should  be  dispensed  to  the  healthcare  settings  where  administration  takes  place,  as 
agreed at the MS level, based on local legal requirements and/or local healthcare systems. When the 
administration is intended for outpatients, it should only be reserved to an environment where the patient 
is  appropriately  followed-up.  SPRAVATO  may  induce  transient  sedation,  dissociative  and  perception 
disorders and/or hypertension. Patients must, therefore, be monitored by a HCP during and after each 
treatment session including an assessment to determine when the patient is considered clinically stable 
and ready to leave the healthcare setting. In patients with clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular 
or respiratory conditions, SPRAVATO should be administered in a setting where appropriate resuscitation 
equipment and healthcare professionals with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available.  
The following EM should be provided to HCPs (and acknowledgement of receipt recorded): 
o  The  HCP  guide,  aiming  at  addressing  the  risks  of  Transient  dissociative  states  and  perception 
disorders,  Drug  abuse,  Disturbances  in  consciousness,  and  Blood  pressure  increased,  should 
incorporate adequate reference to patient’s safety, and highlight that: 
•  All patients must be monitored accordingly after SPRAVATO administration until considered 
clinically stable to leave the healthcare setting; 
• 
In  patients  with  clinically  significant  or  unstable  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  conditions, 
SPRAVATO should be administered in a clinical setting where equipment for cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and staff trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available; 
Assessment report  
EMA/614876/2019  
Page 174/175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Due to the potential risk of cardiac adverse events, the patient’s blood pressure should be 
carefully monitored before and after SPRAVATO intake. 
o  The readiness to leave checklist for HCPs (attached to the HCP guide): the objective of this EM is 
to aid HCPs in evaluating when, following SPRAVATO administration, a patient is deemed stable and 
safely allowed to leave the clinic/facility where SPRAVATO has been administered. 
The following EM should be provided to patients: 
o  The  guide  for  patients,  aiming  at  addressing  the  risks  of  Transient  dissociative  states  and 
perception disorders, Drug abuse, Disturbances in consciousness and Blood pressure increased. The 
objective of this EM is to detail:  
•  Which adverse effects to expect following SPRAVATO administration, and how to minimize 
those effects; 
•  Risk factors/groups/ signs of abuse and dependence, which should be regularly assessed and 
monitored; 
• 
The procedure for SPRAVATO intranasal administration, including preparation (fasting for 2 
hours, no drinking for 30 minutes) and patient’s monitoring; 
The guide for patients also aims at increasing awareness about:  
• 
The steps for SPRAVATO self-administration under direct HCP supervision; 
•  Monitoring of blood pressure before and after SPRAVATO dosing; 
•  Requirements  for  HCP  supervision  and  post-dose  observation,  until  the  HCP  confirms  the 
patient is clinically stable and is allowed to leave the clinic/facility where SPRAVATO has been 
administered; 
• 
The influence of SPRAVATO on the patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery

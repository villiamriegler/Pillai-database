The long-term safety data over 5 years from 1178 patients 
results from study PAM 3038-1, which assessed long 
term safety data collected from predefined cohorts of 
subjects treated with ibrutinib for up to 5 years or 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at 
the recommended daily doses of 420 mg/day for 
CLL/SLL and 560 mg/day for MCL (MEA 025). 
(treatment-naïve CLL/SLL n = 162, relapsed/refractory 
CLL/SLL n = 646, and relapsed/refractory MCL n = 370) 
treated with IMBRUVICA were analysed. The median 
duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 51 months (range, 
0.2 to 98 months) with 70% and 52% of patients receiving 
treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, respectively.

The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months 
(range, 0 to 87 months) with 31% and 17% of patients 
receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years, 
respectively. The overall known safety profile of 
IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, other 
than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new 
safety concerns identified. The prevalence for Grade 3 or 
greater hypertension was 4% (year 0 1), 6% (year 1-2), 
8% (year 2-3), 9% (year 3-4), and 9% (year 4-5). The

Ibrutinib has a pH dependent solubility, with lower

fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose 
of ibrutinib after taking omeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 
5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the 
lower Cmax would have clinical significance, and medicinal

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

The below paragraph has been removed: 
Effects on the QT interval 
In a phase 2 study, ECG evaluations showed IMBRUVICA 
produced a mild decrease in QTcF interval (mean 7.5 ms). 
Although the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of 
this finding are not known, clinicians should use clinical 
judgment when assessing whether to prescribe ibrutinib to 
patients at risk from further shortening their QTc duration 
(e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a 
family history of such a syndrome). 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
The below paragraph has been inserted: 
Effect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of ibrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 
20 healthy male and female subjects in a randomised, 
double blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive 
controls. At a supratherapeutic dose of 1680 mg, ibrutinib 
did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant

extent. The largest upper bound of the 2 sided 90% CI for 
the baseline adjusted mean differences between ibrutinib 
and placebo was below 10 ms. In this same study, a 
concentration dependent shortening in the QTc interval was 
observed ( 5.3 ms [90% CI:  9.4,  1.1] at a Cmax of 719 
ng/mL following the supratherapeutic dose of 1680 mg).

with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, 
and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically 
monitor all patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients 
who develop arrhythmic symptoms or new onset of

new cases from ibrutinib monotherapy studies and/or 
literature, section 4.4 of the SmPC for Imbruvica has been 
updated. Patients should be monitored for pulmonary 
symptoms indicative of ILD. If symptoms develop, 
Imbruvica should be interrupted and ILD managed 
appropriately. If symptoms persist, the risks and benefits of 
Imbruvica treatment should be considered and dose 
modification guidelines followed. Interstitial Lung Disease 
has also been added as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. The incidence of ILD in clinical studies was 
1.7%, considered a common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) adverse 
reaction.

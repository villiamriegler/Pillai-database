Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In vitro studies demonstrated that neratinib and its main 
information on distribution and on the effect of 
neratinib on CYP substrates based on non-clinical 
studies XT218036 and 20325317; Study XT218036 
was designed to evaluate neratinib as a substrate of 
the human transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and 
study 20325317 objective was to determine the 
inactivation kinetic constants (kinact and KI) of 
Neratinib and M6 for the human cytochrome P450 
(CYP) isoenzymes 2B6 and 3A4 using pooled human 
liver microsomes (HLM). 
In addition, MAH is also taking this opportunity to 
introduce editorial changes.

metabolite M6 are not substrates of hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1*1a and OATP1B3 at relevant clinical 
concentration. 
Neratinib and metabolite M6 were not potent direct 
inhibitors of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 and 
no time-dependent inhibition is expected.

was 8.03 years in the neratinib arm and 8.10 years in the 
placebo arm, with 746 (52.5%) patients in the neratinib 
arm and 796 (56.1%) patients in the placebo arm followed 
up for survival for 8 or more years. The number of deaths 
was 127 (8.9%) in the patients treated with neratinib and 
137 (9.6%) in the patients treated with placebo. There was 
no statistically significant difference in overall survival 
between the Nerlynx and the placebo arm [HR 0.96 (95% 
CI: 0.75, 1.22)] in the ITT population at a median follow-up 
of 8.06 years.  
In the hormone receptor positive population who were less 
than one year from completion of trastuzumab therapy, the 
median follow-up was 8.0 years in the neratinib arm and 
8.1 years in the placebo arm, with 671 (23.6%) patients in 
the neratinib arm and 668 (23.5%) patients in the placebo 
arm followed up for survival for 8 or more years. In this

patients treated with neratinib and 68 (10.2%) in the 
patients treated with placebo [HR 0.83 (95% CI, 0.58,

For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC in order to update the pharmacokinetics 
properties of neratinib and amend drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) information with CYP3A4/P-gp 
inducers and inhibitors based on two ADME studies 
(PUMA-NER-0105 and PUMA-NER-0102), a PBPK 
model report and in vitro studies; the Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to make minor corrections to 
the PI and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10 and SmPC Guideline. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC in order to update DDI information with H2-
receptor antagonists and add DDI information with 
loperamide based on two DDI studies (PUMA-NER-
0104, PUMA-NER-0103); the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
and P-gp inhibitors is not recommended due to risk of 
increased exposure to neratinib. If the inhibitor cannot be 
avoided, Nerlynx dose adjustment should be applied. 
Nerlynx dose should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily 
with a strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor. Nerlynx dose should 
be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily with a moderate 
CYP3A4/P-gp. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased 
to 80 mg for at least 1 week, then to 120 mg for at least 1 
weeks, and to 160 mg as a maximal daily dose. Patient 
should be monitored carefully, especially GI effect including 
diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity. After discontinuation of a 
strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor, the previous 
dose of Nerlynx 240 mg can be resumed. 
Concomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inducer is not recommended as it may lead to a loss of 
neratinib efficacy. Co-administration with the following 
medical products that are strong inducers of the CYP3A4/P-
gp isoform of cytochrome P450 is contraindicated: 
carbamazepine, phenytoin (antiepileptics); St John’s wort 
(Hypericum perforatum) (herbal product); rifampicin 
(antimycobacterial).

Treatments that increase gastrointestinal pH may lower the 
absorption of neratinib, thus decreasing systemic exposure. 
In case of H2-receptor antagonists modalities of 
administration should be adapted. Nerlynx should be taken 
at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after the intake of the 
H2-receptor antagonist.

between the IRT and CRF data did not lead to imbalance

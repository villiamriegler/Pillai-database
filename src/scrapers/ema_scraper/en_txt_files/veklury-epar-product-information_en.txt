Elderly 
No dose adjustment of remdesivir is required in patients over the age of 65 years (see sections 5.1 and 
5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of remdesivir is required in patients with renal impairment, including those on 
dialysis. However, safety data in patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) are limited (see section 4.4) and based on a 5-day treatment duration. The timing of 
administration of remdesivir is without regard to dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of remdesivir is required in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions have been observed 
during and following administration of remdesivir. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, 
hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnoea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of 
up to 120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. Monitor 
patients for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of remdesivir as clinically 
appropriate. Patients receiving remdesivir in an outpatient setting should be monitored after 
administration according to local medical practice. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant 
hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of remdesivir and initiate 
appropriate treatment. 
Renal impairment 
As clinically appropriate, patients should have eGFR determined prior to starting remdesivir and while 
receiving it. Safety data from patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD reported during Study 
GS-US-540-5912 were comparable to the known safety profile of remdesivir. However, there are 
limited safety data in this patient population. Therefore, taking the significant higher exposure of the 
metabolite GS-441524 into account, patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD should be 
closely monitored for adverse events during treatment with remdesivir (see section 5.2). 
Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  
Coadministration of remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not 
recommended based on in vitro data demonstrating an antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the 
intracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of remdesivir (see sections 4.5 and 5.1) 
Immunocompromised patients: 
It is unclear if the treatment duration of three days is sufficient to clear the virus in 
immunocompromised patients, in whom prolonged viral shedding occurs. There is a potential risk of 
resistance development. Only limited data are available. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 212 mg sodium per 100 mg dose, equivalent to 10.6% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Due to antagonism observed in vitro, concomitant use of remdesivir with chloroquine phosphate or 
hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other medicinal products on remdesivir 
In vitro, remdesivir is a substrate for esterases in plasma and tissue, drug metabolizing enzyme 
CYP3A4 and is a substrate for Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1) and 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. GS-704277 (a metabolite of remdesivir) is a substrate for 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
A drug-drug interaction study was conducted with remdesivir. Table 5 summarises the 
pharmacokinetic effects of studied drugs on remdesivir and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524.

Recommendation 
concerning co-
administration 
No dose adjustment of 
remdesivir is required 
when it is co-administered 
with inhibitors of 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
No dose adjustment of 
remdesivir is required 
when it is co-administered 
with strong CYP3A4 
and/or P-gp inducers. 
No interactions are expected when co-administering 
remdesivir with strong CYP3A4 inducers or CYP3A4 
inhibitors. 
NOTE: Interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers. 
Effects of remdesivir on other medicinal products 
In vitro, remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, UGT1A1, MATE1, OAT3, OCT1, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3. Until respective clinical data become available, the coadministration of sensitive substrates 
of these enzymes and/or transporters should be considered with caution. Remdesivir induced CYP1A2 
and potentially CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of remdesivir with CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates 
with narrow therapeutic index may lead to loss of their efficacy. 
Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although remdesivir inhibits CYP3A4, due to 
remdesivir's rapid clearance after IV administration, remdesivir is unlikely to have a significant effect 
on dexamethasone exposure. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of remdesivir in pregnant women (less than 
300 pregnancy outcomes). Most of the exposures occurred in the second, third or an unknown 
trimester and available data do not indicate any risk.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at 
exposures of the major metabolite of remdesivir that were around human therapeutic exposures (see 
section 5.3). 
Due to very limited experience, remdesivir should not be used during first trimester in pregnancy 
unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with it. Use in the second and third 
trimester of pregnancy may be considered. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of effective contraception during treatment should be considered in women of child-bearing 
potential. 
Breast-feeding 
Remdesivir and its major metabolite are excreted into breast milk in very small amounts after 
intravenous administration. No clinical effect on the infant is expected due to low breast milk transfer 
and poor oral bioavailability. 
As the clinical experience is limited, a decision about breast-feeding during treatment should be made 
after a careful individual benefit-risk assessment. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of remdesivir on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect 
on mating or fertility with remdesivir treatment. In female rats, however, an impairment of fertility 
was observed (see section 5.3). The relevance for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Remdesivir is predicted to have no or negligible influence on these abilities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reaction in healthy volunteers is increased transaminases (14%). The most 
common adverse reaction in patients with COVID-19 is nausea (4%). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions in Table 6 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies 
are defined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Transaminases increased 
In healthy volunteer studies, increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) or both in subjects who received remdesivir were 1.25 to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) (10%) or 2.5 to 5 times ULN (4%). In clinical studies of patients with COVID-19, the 
incidence of increased transaminases was similar in patients treated with remdesivir compared to 
placebo or standard of care. 
Prothrombin time prolonged  
In a clinical study (NIAID ACTT-1) of patients with COVID-19, the incidence of prolonged 
prothrombin time or INR (predominantly less than 2 times ULN) was higher in subjects who received 
remdesivir compared to placebo, with no difference observed in the incidence of bleeding events 
between the two groups. In Study GS-US-540-9012, the incidence of increased prothrombin time or 
INR was similar in patients treated with remdesivir compared to placebo. 
Patients with renal impairment 
In Study GS-US-540-5912, 163 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute kidney 
injury, chronic kidney disease or ESRD on haemodialysis received remdesivir for up to 5 days (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). Safety data from these patients were comparable to the known safety profile of 
remdesivir. In this same study, the incidence of increased prothrombin time or INR was higher in 
patients treated with remdesivir compared to placebo, with no difference observed in the incidence of 
bleeding events between the two groups (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety assessment of remdesivir in children 4 weeks of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg 
with COVID-19 is based on data from a Phase 2/3, open-label clinical trial (Study GS-US-540-5823) 
that enrolled 53 patients who were treated with remdesivir (see Section 5.1). The adverse reactions 
observed were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of remdesivir in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Treatment of overdose with remdesivir should consist of general supportive measures including 
monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific 
antidote for overdose with remdesivir.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AB16 
Mechanism of action 
Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that is metabolized within host cells to form the 
pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite. Remdesivir triphosphate acts as an 
analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate for incorporation 
into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in 
delayed chain termination during replication of the viral RNA. As an additional mechanism, 
remdesivir triphosphate can also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the 
template viral RNA as a result of read-through by the viral polymerase that may occur in the presence 
of higher nucleotide concentrations. When remdesivir nucleotide is present in the viral RNA template, 
the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide is compromised, thereby 
inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. 
Antiviral activity 
Remdesivir exhibited in vitro activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in primary human 
airway epithelial cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 9.9 nM after 48 hours of treatment. 
Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the continuous human lung epithelial cell 
lines Calu-3 and A549-hACE2 with EC50 values of 280 nM after 72 hours of treatment and 115 nM 
after 48 hours of treatment, respectively. The EC50 values of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero 
cells were 137 nM at 24 hours and 750 nM at 48 hours post-treatment.  
The antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonised by chloroquine phosphate in a dose-dependent 
manner when the two drugs were co-incubated at clinically relevant concentrations in HEp-2 cells 
infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Higher remdesivir EC50 values were observed with 
increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate. Increasing concentrations of chloroquine 
phosphate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in A549-hACE2, HEp-2 and normal human 
bronchial epithelial cells. 
Based on in vitro testing, remdesivir retained similar antiviral activity (EC50 fold change values below 
the in vitro susceptibility change cutoff of 2.8-fold) against clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 variants 
compared to an earlier lineage SARS-CoV-2 (lineage A) isolate, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta 
(B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), Epsilon (B.1.429), Zeta (P.2), Iota (B.1.526), Kappa 
(B.1.617.1), Lambda (C.37) and Omicron variants (including B.1.1.529/BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, 
BA.2.75, BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5, BF.5, BF.7, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, CH.1.1, XBB and XBB.1.5). For these 
variants, the EC50 fold change values ranged between 0.2 to 2.3 compared to an earlier lineage SARS-
CoV-2 (lineage A) isolate.  
Resistance 
In Cell Culture 
SARS-CoV-2 isolates with reduced susceptibility to remdesivir have been selected in cell culture. In 
one selection with GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, virus pools emerged expressing 
combinations of amino acid substitutions at V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I, C799F, and C799R in the 
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, conferring EC50 fold-changes of 2.7 up to 10.4. When 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
individually introduced into a wild-type recombinant virus by site-directed mutagenesis, 1.7- to 3.5-
fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir was observed. In a second selection with remdesivir using a 
SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the P323L substitution in the viral polymerase, a single amino acid 
substitution at V166L emerged. Recombinant viruses with substitutions at P323L alone or 
P323L+V166L in combination exhibited 1.3- and 1.5-fold changes in remdesivir susceptibility, 
respectively. 
Cell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified 
two substitutions (F476L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase at residues 
conserved across CoVs that conferred 5.6-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Introduction of the 
corresponding substitutions (F480L and V557L) into SARS-CoV resulted in 6-fold reduced 
susceptibility to remdesivir in cell culture and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. 
When individually introduced into a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus, the corresponding substitutions 
at F480L and V557L each conferred 2-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. 
In Clinical Trials 
In NIAID ACTT-1 Study (CO-US-540-5776), among 61 patients with baseline and post-baseline 
sequencing data available, the rate of emerging substitutions in the viral RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase was similar in patients treated with remdesivir compared to placebo. In 2 patients treated 
with remdesivir, substitutions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase previously identified in 
resistance selection experiments (V792I or C799F) and associated with low fold change in remdesivir 
susceptibility (≤3.4-fold) were observed. No other RNA-dependent RNA polymerase substitutions 
observed in patients treated with remdesivir were associated with resistance to remdesivir. 
In  Study  GS-US-540-5773,  among  19  patients  treated  with  remdesivir  who  had  baseline  and  post-
baseline  sequencing  data  available,  substitutions  in  the  viral  RNA-dependent  RNA  polymerase 
(nsp12)  were  observed  in  4  patients.  The  substitutions  T76I,  A526V,  A554V  and  C697F  were  not 
associated  with  resistance  to  remdesivir  (≤ 1.45-fold  change  in  susceptibility).  The  effect  of 
substitution E665K on susceptibility to remdesivir could not be determined due to lack of replication. 
In GS-US-540-9012 Study, among 244 patients with baseline and post-baseline sequencing data 
available, the rate of emerging substitutions in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was similar 
in patients treated with remdesivir compared to placebo. In one patient treated with remdesivir, one 
substitution in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (A376V) emerged and was associated with a 
decrease in remdesivir susceptibility in vitro (12.6-fold). No other substitutions in the RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase or other proteins of the replication-transcription complex observed in patients treated 
with remdesivir were associated with resistance to remdesivir. 
In Study GS-US-540-5912, among 60 patients with baseline and post-baseline sequencing data 
available, substitutions in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase emerged in 8 patients treated 
with remdesivir. In 4 patients treated with remdesivir, substitutions in the RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (M794I, C799F, or E136V) emerged and were associated with reduced susceptibility to 
remdesivir in vitro (≤3.5-fold). No other substitutions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
detected in patients treated with remdesivir were associated with resistance to remdesivir. 
In Study GS-US-540-5823, among patients with baseline and post-baseline sequencing data available, 
substitutions in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (A656P and G670V) were observed in one 
of 23 patients treated with remdesivir. The substitutions observed have not been associated with 
resistance to remdesivir.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 
NIAID ACTT-1 Study (CO-US-540-5776) 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated remdesivir 200 mg once daily 
for 1 day followed by remdesivir 100 mg once daily for up to 9 days (for a total of up to 10 days of 
intravenously administered therapy) in hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 with evidence of 
lower respiratory tract involvement. The trial enrolled 1,062 hospitalised patients: 159 (15%) patients 
with mild/moderate disease (15% in both treatment groups) and 903 (85%) patients with severe 
disease (85% in both treatment groups). Mild/moderate disease was defined as SpO2 > 94% and 
respiratory rate < 24 breaths/minute without supplemental oxygen; severe disease was defined as 
SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, a respiratory rate ≥ 24 breaths/min, and an oxygen requirement, or a 
requirement for mechanical ventilation. A total of 285 patients (26.8%) (n=131 received remdesivir) 
were on mechanical ventilation/Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Patients were 
randomised 1:1, stratified by disease severity at enrolment, to receive remdesivir (n=541) or placebo 
(n=521), plus standard of care. 
The baseline mean age was 59 years and 36% of patients were aged 65 or older. Sixty-four percent 
were male, 53% were White, 21% were Black, 13% were Asian. The most common comorbidities 
were hypertension (51%), obesity (45%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (31%); the distribution of 
comorbidities was similar between the two treatment groups. 
Approximately 38.4% (208/541) of the patients received a 10-day treatment course with remdesivir. 
The primary clinical endpoint was time to recovery within 29 days after randomisation, defined as 
either discharged from hospital (with or without limitations of activity and with or without home 
oxygen requirements) or hospitalised but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring 
ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery was 10 days in the remdesivir group compared to 
15 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.29; [95% CI 1.12 to 1.49], p < 0.001).  
No difference in time to recovery was seen in the stratum of patients with mild-moderate disease at 
enrolment (n=159). The median time to recovery was 5 days in the remdesivir and 7 days in the 
placebo groups (recovery rate ratio 1.10; [95% CI 0.8 to 1.53]); the odds of improvement in the 
ordinal scale in the remdesivir group at Day 15 when compared to the placebo group were as follows: 
odds ratio, 1.2; [95% CI 0.7 to 2.2, p = 0.562]. 
Among patients with severe disease at enrolment (n=903), the median time to recovery was 12 days in 
the remdesivir group compared to 19 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio, 1.34; [95% CI 
1.14 to 1.58]; p < 0.001); the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale in the remdesivir group at Day 
15 when compared to the placebo group were as follows: odds ratio, 1.6; [95% CI 1.3 to 2.0]. 
Overall, the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale were higher in the remdesivir group at Day 15 
when compared to the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.6; [95% CI 1.3 to 1.9], p < 0.001). 
The 29-day mortality in the overall population was 11.6% for the remdesivir group vs 15.4% for the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; [95% CI 0.52 to 1.03]; p=0.07). A post-hoc analysis of 29-day 
mortality by ordinal scale is reported in Table 7.

Study GS-US-540-5773 in Patients with Severe COVID-19  
A randomised, open-label multi-centre clinical trial (Study 5773) of patients at least 12 years of age 
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of ≤ 94% on room air, and radiological 
evidence of pneumonia compared 200 patients who received remdesivir for 5 days with 197 patients 
who received remdesivir for 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on Day 1 and 100 mg 
once daily on subsequent days, plus standard of care. The primary endpoint was clinical status on Day 
14 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen 
and ventilatory support to death.  
The odds of improvement at Day 14 for patients randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir 
compared with those randomized to a 5-day course was 0.67 (odds ratio); [95% CI 0.46 to 0.98]. 
Statistically significant imbalances in baseline clinical status were observed in this study. After 
adjusting for between-group differences at baseline, the odds of improvement at Day 14 was 0.75 
(odds ratio); [95% CI 0.51 to 1.12]. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in 
recovery rates or mortality rates in the 5-day and 10-day groups once adjusted for between group 
differences at baseline. All-cause 28-day mortality was 12% vs 14% in the 5- and 10-day treatment 
groups, respectively. 
Study GS-US-540-9012 in patients with confirmed COVID-19 at increased risk for disease 
progression  
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial to evaluate treatment with 
remdesivir in an outpatient setting in 562 patients including 8 adolescents (12 years of age and older 
and weighing at least 40 kg) with confirmed COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for disease 
progression to hospitalisation. Risk factors for disease progression were: aged ≥ 60 years, chronic lung 
disease, hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, 
immunocompromised state, chronic mild or moderate kidney disease, chronic liver disease, current 
cancer, or sickle cell disease. Vaccinated patients were excluded from the study.  
Patients treated with remdesivir received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days 
for a total of 3 days of intravenously administered therapy. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner, 
stratified by residence in a skilled nursing facility (yes/no), age (< 60 vs ≥ 60 years), and region (US 
vs ex-US) to receive remdesivir (n=279) or placebo (n=283), plus standard of care. 
At baseline, mean age was 50 years (with 30% of patients aged 60 or older); 52% were male, 80% 
were White, 8% were Black, 2% were Asian, 44% were Hispanic or Latino; median body mass index 
was 30.7 kg/m2. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (62%), obesity (56%), and 
hypertension (48%). Median (Q1, Q3) duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 5 (3,6) days; 
median viral load was 6.3 log10 copies/mL at baseline. The baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics were balanced across the remdesivir and placebo treatment groups. Post-hoc 
exploratory analysis of optional biomarker samples showed 14.8% of patients were serological 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive at baseline and 37.7% were serological negative (47.5% did not consent to optional biomarker 
collection).   
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with COVID-19 related hospitalisation (defined 
as at least 24 hours of acute care) or all-cause 28-day mortality. Events (COVID-19-related 
hospitalisation or all-cause 28-day mortality) occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients treated with remdesivir 
compared to 15 (5.3%) patients concurrently randomized to placebo, demonstrating an 87% reduction 
in COVID-19-related hospitalisation or all-cause mortality compared to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.134 
[95% CI, 0.031 to 0.586]; p=0.0076). The absolute risk reduction was 4.6% (95% CI, 1.8% to 7.5%). 
No deaths were observed at Day 28. Six of the 17 hospitalisation events occurred in participants with 
known baseline serostatus (serological positive: n=0 in remdesivir group and n=2 in placebo group; 
serological negative: n=2 in remdesivir group and n=2 in placebo group). Eleven of the 17 
hospitalisation events occurred in participants with unknown baseline serostatus in placebo group and 
none in the remdesivir group. No conclusion can be made on efficacy in the subgroups stratified by 
serostatus due to the small number of patients with known serostatus and overall low event rates. 
Study GS-US-540-5912 in patients with COVID-19 and renal impairment  
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (Study GS-US-540-5912) evaluated 
remdesivir 200 mg once daily for 1 day followed by remdesivir 100 mg once daily for 4 days (for a 
total of up to 5 days of intravenously administered therapy) in 243 hospitalised adult patients with 
confirmed COVID-19 and renal impairment. The trial included 90 patients (37%) with AKI (defined 
as a 50% increase in serum creatinine within a 48-hour period that was sustained for ≥6 hours despite 
supportive care), 64 patients (26%) with CKD (eGFR <30 mL/minute), and 89 patients (37%) with 
ESRD (eGFR <15 mL/minute) requiring haemodialysis. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner, 
stratified by ESRD, high-flow oxygen requirement, and region (US vs ex-US) to receive remdesivir 
(n=163) or placebo (n=80), plus standard of care. 
At baseline, mean age was 69 years (with 62% of patients aged 65 or older); 57% of patients were 
male, 67% were White, 26% were Black, and 3% were Asian. The most common baseline risk factors 
were hypertension (89%), diabetes mellitus (79%), and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease 
(51%); the distribution of risk factors was similar between the two treatment groups. A total of 45 
patients (19%) were on high-flow oxygen, 144 (59%) were on low-flow oxygen, and 54 (22%) were 
on room air at baseline; no patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). A total of 182 
patients (75%) were not on renal replacement therapy, and 31 patients (13%) had received a COVID-
19 vaccine. The study closed prematurely due to feasibility issues and was underpowered to assess 
primary (all-cause death or IMV by Day 29) and secondary efficacy endpoints because of lower than 
expected enrolment. 
QT 
Current non-clinical and clinical data do not suggest a risk of QT prolongation, but QT prolongation 
has not been fully evaluated in humans. 
Paediatric population 
Study GS-US-540-5823 is a single-arm, open-label study where the pharmacokinetics and safety of 
remdesivir in paediatric patients at least 28 days of age and weighing at least 3 kg with COVID-19 
(n=53) was assessed. Efficacy endpoints were secondary and descriptively analysed and therefore 
these should be interpreted with caution. The study is ongoing. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Patients weighing ≥ 40 kg received 200 mg of remdesivir on Day 1 followed by remdesivir 100 mg 
once daily on subsequent days (i.e., the adult dose); patients weighing ≥ 3 kg to < 40 kg received 
remdesivir 5 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by remdesivir 2.5 mg/kg once daily on subsequent days. 
Median (range) exposure to remdesivir was 5 (1, 10) days.   
At baseline, median age was 7 years (range: 0.1 to 17 years); 57% were female; median weight was 
24.6 kg (range: 4 kg to 192 kg). A total of 19 patients (37%) were obese (BMI-for-age ≥ 95th 
percentile); 7 (58%), 2 (17%), 3 (27%), 3 (27%), and 4 (80%) patients in Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 
respectively. A total of 12 patients (23%) were on invasive mechanical ventilation (score of 2 in a 7-
point ordinal scale), 18 (34%) were on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen (score of 3); 
10 (19%) were on low-flow oxygen (score of 4); and 13 (25%) were on room air (score of 5), at 
baseline. The overall median (Q1, Q3) duration of symptoms and hospitalisation prior to first dose of 
remdesivir was 5 (3, 7) days and 1 (1, 3) day, respectively.  
In the overall population of the study, the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in clinical status 
(assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death [score of 1] to hospital discharge [score of 7]) 
was +2.0 (1.0, 4.0) points on Day 10. Among those with an ordinal score of ≤ 5 points at baseline, the 
proportion who had a ≥ 2-point improvement in clinical status on Day 10 was 75.0% (39/52); median 
(Q1, Q3) time to recovery was 7 (5, 16) days. Overall, 60% of patients were discharged by Day 10. 
Most patients 92% (49/53) received at least 1 concomitant medication other than remdesivir for the 
treatment of COVID-19 including immune modulator and anti-inflammatory agents. Three patients 
died during the study. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
remdesivir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir have been investigated in healthy volunteers and 
patients with COVID-19. 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-441524 
have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects. Following intravenous administration of remdesivir 
adult dosage regimen, peak plasma concentration was observed at end of infusion, regardless of dose 
level, and declined rapidly thereafter with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. Peak plasma 
concentrations of GS-441524 were observed at 1.5 to 2.0 hours post start of a 30 minutes infusion. 
Distribution 
Remdesivir is approximately 93% bound to human plasma proteins (ex-vivo data) with free fraction 
ranging from 6.4% to 7.4%. The binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 to 
10 μM, with no evidence for saturation of remdesivir binding. After a single 150 mg dose of [14C]-
remdesivir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.68 
at 15 minutes from start of infusion, increased over time reaching ratio of 1.0 at 5 hours, indicating 
differential distribution of remdesivir and its metabolites to plasma or cellular components of blood. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Remdesivir is extensively metabolized to the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate 
GS-443902 (formed intracellularly). The metabolic activation pathway involves hydrolysis by 
esterases, which leads to the formation of the intermediate metabolite, GS-704277. In the liver, 
carboxylesterase 1 and cathepsin A are the esterases responsible for 80% and 10% of remdesivir 
metabolism, respectively. Phosphoramidate cleavage followed by phosphorylation forms the active 
triphosphate, GS-443902. Dephosphorylation of all phosphorylated metabolites can result in the 
formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 that itself is not efficiently re-phosphorylated. 
Decyanation of remdesivir and/or its metabolites, followed by subsequent rhodanese mediated 
conversion generates thiocyanate anion. The levels of thiocyanate detected following administration of 
100 mg and 200 mg remdesivir were observed to be significantly below endogenous levels in human 
plasma. 
Elimination 
Following a single 150 mg IV dose of [14C]-remdesivir, mean total recovery of the dose was 92%, 
consisting of approximately 74% and 18% recovered in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of 
the remdesivir dose recovered in urine was GS-441524 (49%), while 10% was recovered as 
remdesivir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-441524. 
The median terminal half-lives of remdesivir and GS-441524 were approximately 1 and 27 hours, 
respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and metabolites in adults with COVID-19

Gender, race and age 
Based on gender, race and age, pharmacokinetic differences on the exposures of remdesivir were 
evaluated using population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender and race did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites (GS-704277 and GS-441524). Pharmacokinetic 
exposures of the GS-441524 metabolite were modestly increased in hospitalised COVID-19 patients 
≥ 60 years of age, however no dose adjustment is needed in these patients.

Pregnancy 
In CO-US-540-5961 (IMPAACT 2032) study, mean exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) of remdesivir 
and its metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277) were comparable between pregnant and non-
pregnant women of child-bearing potential. 
Paediatric patients 
Population pharmacokinetic models for remdesivir and its circulating metabolites (GS-704277 and 
GS-441524), developed using pooled data from studies in healthy subjects and in adult and paediatric 
patients with COVID-19, were used to predict pharmacokinetic exposures in 50 paediatric patients 
aged ≥ 28 days to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 3 kg (Study GS-US-540-5823) (Table 9). Geometric 
mean exposures (AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau) for these patients at the doses administered were higher for 
remdesivir (44% to 147%), GS-441524 (-21% to 25%), and GS-704277 (7% to 91%) as compared to 
those in adult hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The increases were not considered clinically 
significant.

Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277) and the 
excipient SBECD were evaluated in healthy subjects, those with mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/minute), 
moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/minute), severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/minute) renal impairment, or with ESRD 
(eGFR <15 mL/minute) on haemodialysis or not on haemodialysis following a single dose of up to 
100 mg of remdesivir (Table 10); and in a Phase 3 study in COVID-19 patients with severely reduced 
kidney function (eGFR <30 mL/minute) receiving remdesivir 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg 
from Day 2 to Day 5 (Table 11). 
16 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic exposures of remdesivir were not affected by renal function or timing of remdesivir 
administration around dialysis. Exposures of GS-704277, GS-441524, and SBECD were up to 2.8-
fold, 7.9-fold and 26-fold higher, respectively, in those with renal impairment than those with normal 
renal function which is not considered clinically significant based on limited available safety data. No 
dose adjustment of remdesivir is required for patients with renal impairment, including those on 
dialysis.

Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277) were evaluated 
in healthy subjects and those with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) 
following a single dose of 100 mg of remdesivir. Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, 
mean exposures (AUCinf, Cmax) of remdesivir and GS-704277 were comparable in moderate hepatic 
impairment and up to 2.4 fold higher in severe hepatic impairment; however, the increase was not 
considered clinically significant.

Pharmacokinetic exposures for remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia 
were generally within the range of the exposures in non-hospitalised patients. The GS-704277 and 
GS-441524 metabolite levels were modestly increased. 
Interactions 
Remdesivir inhibited CYP3A4 in vitro (see section 4.5). At physiologically relevant concentrations 
(steady-state), remdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 in vitro. Remdesivir is not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes 
in vitro. 
Remdesivir induced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A4, but not CYP2B6 in vitro (see section 4.5). 
In vitro data indicates no clinically relevant inhibition of UGT1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 by 
remdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277. Remdesivir, but not its metabolites, 
inhibited UGT1A1 in vitro. 
For GS-441524 and GS-704277, the only enzyme for which metabolism could be detected was 
UGT1A3. 
Remdesivir inhibited OAT3, MATE1, OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro (see section 4.5). 
At physiologically relevant concentrations, remdesivir and its metabolites did not inhibit P-gp and 
BCRP in vitro.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicology 
Following intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rhesus monkeys and rats, severe 
renal toxicity occurred after short treatment durations. In male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5, 
10, and 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days resulted, at all dose levels, in increased mean urea nitrogen and 
increased mean creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts, and an unscheduled death 
of one animal at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level. In rats, dosage levels of >3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks 
resulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Systemic exposures (AUC) of the 
predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) were 0.1 times (monkeys at 
5 mg/kg/day) and 0.3 times (rats at 3 mg/kg/day) the exposure in humans following intravenous 
administration at the recommended human dose (RHD).  
Carcinogenesis 
Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of remdesivir have not been 
performed. 
Mutagenesis 
Remdesivir was not genotoxic in a battery of assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome 
aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat micronucleus assays. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In female rats, decreases in corpora lutea, numbers of implantation sites, and viable embryos, were 
seen when remdesivir was administered intravenously daily at a systemically toxic dose 
(10 mg/kg/day) 14 days prior to mating and during conception; exposures of the predominant 
circulating metabolite (GS-441524) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. There were no 
effects on female reproductive performance (mating, fertility, and conception) at this dose level. 
In rats and rabbits, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryofoetal development when 
administered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures (AUC) of the predominant circulating 
metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were up to 4 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. 
In rats, there were no adverse effects on pre- and post-natal development at systemic exposures (AUC) 
of the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were similar to the exposure 
in humans at the RHD.

over 30 to 120 minutes. 
Preparation of remdesivir solution for infusion 
Reconstitution 
Remove the required number of single-use vial(s) from storage. For each vial: 
• 
Aseptically reconstitute remdesivir powder for concentrate for solution for infusion by addition 
of 19 mL of sterile water for injections using a suitably sized syringe and needle per vial, and 
insert the needle in the centre of the vial stopper. 
◦ 
Only use sterile water for injection to reconstitute remdesivir powder. 
Immediately shake the vial for 30 seconds. 
Allow the contents of the vial to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. A clear solution should result. 
Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the sterile water for injections into the vial.

• 
• 
• 
If the contents of the vial are not completely dissolved, shake the vial again for 30 seconds and 
allow the contents to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat this procedure as necessary until the 
contents of the vial are completely dissolved. 
Inspect the vial to ensure the container closure is free from defects and the solution is free of 
particulate matter. 
Dilute immediately after reconstitution. 
Dilution 
Care should be taken to prevent inadvertent microbial contamination. As there is no preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent present in this product, aseptic technique must be used in preparation of the final 
parenteral solution. It is recommended to administer immediately after preparation when possible.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Veklury is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Veklury is remdesivir. It is an antiviral medicine used for treating COVID-19. 
COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. Veklury stops the virus multiplying in cells and 
this stops the virus multiplying in the body. This can help your body to overcome the virus infection, 
and may help you get better faster. 
Veklury will be given to treat COVID-19 in: 
• 
• 
adults and children (at least 4 weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg) who have 
pneumonia, and need extra oxygen to help them breathe, but who are not on artificial 
ventilation (where mechanical means are used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing 
at start of treatment). 
adults and children (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not need extra oxygen to help them 
breathe and are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Veklury 
You will not usually be given Veklury: 
• 
if you are allergic to remdesivir, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
 Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before starting on Veklury: 
• 
if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may monitor you if you have kidney problems to 
ensure your safety. 
If you are immunocompromised. Your doctor may monitor you more closely if your immune 
system is not working properly to ensure the treatment is working. 
• 
Reactions following the infusion 
Veklury can cause allergic reactions following and during the infusion, including anaphylactic 
reactions (sudden life-threatening allergic reactions). Allergic reactions have been seen rarely. For 
anaphylactic reactions frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. Symptoms can include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Changes to blood pressure or heart rate 
Low oxygen level in blood 
High temperature 
Shortness of breath, wheezing 
Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) 
Rash 
Feeling sick (nausea) 
Being sick (vomiting) 
Sweating 
Shivering 
 Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of these effects. 
Blood tests before and during treatment 
If you are prescribed Veklury, you may be given blood tests before treatment starts. Patients being 
treated with Veklury may have blood tests during their treatment as determined by their healthcare 
professional. These tests are to check for kidney problems. 
Children and adolescents 
Veklury is not to be given to children under 4 weeks old or to children who weigh less than 3 kg. Not 
enough is known for it to be given to these children. 
Other medicines and Veklury 
Tell your doctor or nurse about any other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken. 
Do not take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at the same time as Veklury. 
 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be. There is not enough information 
to be sure that Veklury is safe for use in first trimester of pregnancy. Veklury should only be given if 
the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential of risks to the mother and the unborn child. 
Discuss with your doctor the need to use effective contraception during treatment with Veklury. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding. Veklury passes into human breast milk in very 
small amounts. Because there is limited experience with use during breast-feeding, you should 
carefully discuss with your doctor whether to continue or interrupt breast-feeding during treatment 
with Veklury. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Veklury is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive. 
Veklury contains a cyclodextrin 
This medicine contains 3 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium in each 100 mg dose of Veklury (6 g in 
the starting dose). This ingredient is a cyclodextrin emulsifier that helps the medicine to disperse in the 
body. 
Veklury contains sodium 
This medicine contains 212 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 100 mg dose 
unit. This is equivalent to 10.6 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. 
3. 
How Veklury is given to you 
Veklury will be given to you by a nurse or doctor, as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion) 
lasting 30 to 120 minutes, once a day. You will be closely monitored during your treatment.

Instructions for healthcare professionals 
Veklury 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
remdesivir 
Each single-use vial contains 100 mg of remdesivir as a white to off-white to yellow powder for 
reconstitution and dilution. 
Summary of treatment 
Veklury is used for the treatment of COVID-19 in: 
• 
• 
adults and paediatric patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with 
pneumonia, who require supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-
invasive ventilation at start of treatment) 
adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19  
Veklury should be administered by intravenous infusion in a total volume of 25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL 
or 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride over 30 to 120 minutes.

Not applicable. 
The powder must be reconstituted with sterile water for injections, and then diluted with sodium 
chloride solution 9 mg/mL (0.9%) under aseptic conditions. Administer the diluted solution 
immediately. 
As clinically appropriate, patients should have their renal function determined before starting and 
while receiving remdesivir. 
Monitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion. See below for details on reporting of 
side effects. 
Reconstitute the powder 
• 
Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the sterile water into the vial. 
For each single-use vial, the powder must be reconstituted and then diluted under aseptic conditions. 
• 
Add 19 mL of sterile water for injections to the vial, using a suitably sized syringe and needle 
for each vial, and insert the needle in the centre of the vial stopper. 
This produces a solution of 5 mg/mL of remdesivir. 
◦ 
Only use sterile water for injection to reconstitute remdesivir powder.  
Immediately shake the vial for 30 seconds. 
Allow the contents of the vial to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. A clear solution should result. 
If the contents of the vial are not completely dissolved, shake the vial again for 30 seconds and 
allow the contents to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat this procedure as necessary until the 
contents of the vial are completely dissolved. 
Inspect the vial to ensure the container closure is free from defects.

The solution should only be used if it is clear and free from particles. 
Dilute immediately after reconstitution. 
Dilute the concentrate with sodium chloride solution 
Reconstituted Veklury must be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection 
under aseptic conditions. 
Dilution instructions for adults and paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg 
Using Table 3, decide how much sodium chloride solution 9 mg/mL (0.9%) to withdraw from the 
infusion bag.

•  Withdraw and discard the required volume of sodium chloride solution from the infusion bag 
using an appropriately sized syringe and needle. See Table 3. 
•  Withdraw the required volume of reconstituted Veklury from the vial using an appropriately 
• 
• 
• 
sized syringe. See Table 3. 
Transfer the reconstituted Veklury to the infusion bag. 
Gently invert the bag 20 times to mix the solution in the bag. Do not shake. 
Administer the diluted solution immediately, or as soon as possible after preparation. The 
diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) or 48 hours in a 
fridge (2°C to 8°C).

Further dilute the 100 mg/20 mL (5 mg/mL) remdesivir concentrate to a fixed concentration of 
1.25 mg/mL using 0.9% sodium chloride.  
The total required infusion volume of the 1.25 mg/mL remdesivir solution for infusion is 
calculated from the paediatric weight-based dosing regimens of 5 mg/kg for the loading dose 
and 2.5 mg/kg for each maintenance dose. 
Small 0.9% sodium chloride infusion bags (e.g., 25, 50, or 100 mL) or an appropriately sized 
syringe should be used for paediatric dosing. The recommended dose is administered via IV 
infusion in a total volume dependent on the dose to yield the target remdesivir concentration of 
1.25 mg/mL.  
A syringe may be used for delivering volumes < 50 mL.

Administer the infusion 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Use under conditions where treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, is possible. 
Administer the diluted solution over 30 to 120 minutes at the rate described in Table 4 or 
Table 5. 
After infusion is complete, flush with at least 30 mL of 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride 
solution. 
The diluted solution should not be administered simultaneously with any other medicines in the 
same intravenous line. The compatibility of Veklury with IV solutions and medications other 
than sodium chloride is not known.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The clinical phase III development program for

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to accurately 
reflect the percentage of cases of dry mouth and 
section 5.1 to revise the p-values of trough FEV1 and 
the information on the reduction of COPD 
exacerbations in the pivotal studies A2304 and 
A2303. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity 
to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template, 
to make minor editorial changes and to include the 
black triangle to reflect that the product is under 
additional monitoring.

and PL 
glycopyrronium bromide included two pivotal 
studies: a 6-month placebo-controlled study 
(CNVA237A2304) and a 12-month placebo and 
active-controlled (open label tiotropium 18 
micrograms once daily) study 
(CNVA237A2303), both in patients with clinical 
diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. The 
SmPC reflects the primary endpoint trough 
FEV1 for glycopyrronium bromide compared to 
placebo at the 6-month time-point (108mL) for 
study A2304 and at the 12-month time-point 
(97mL) for study A2303. In order to more 
precisely reflect the study results, the p-values 
for both studies are being changed from 
p<0.05 to p<0.001 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the information related to the 
reduction of COPD exacerbations is being 
revised in section 5.1 of the SmPC to improve 
clarity and accuracy. 
The percentage of cases of “dry mouth” 
reported for glycopyrronium bromide 
compared to placebo is 2.4% versus 1.1% for 
the MedDRA Preferred Term “dry throat”. This 
was changed in order to reflect the actual 
number of patients with the MedDRA Preferred 
Term (PT) “dry mouth” in the 6-month 
database i.e. 2.2% versus 1.1% in accordance 
with the EPAR.

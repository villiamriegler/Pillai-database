2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This application for Adempas (riociguat) is a Type II variation for adding an indication in paediatric 
patients aged 6 to less than 18 years with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a rare disease 
where pulmonary arterial pressure is elevated and can affect both adults and children.

EMA/229554/2023 
Page 7/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epidemiology  
PAH in paediatrics is a rare disease. The estimated incidence and prevalence of PAH is 0.5–2.2 cases per 
million children-years and 2–16 cases per million children, respectively (Fraisse et al. 2010, Moledina et 
al. 2010, van Loon et al. 2011). An evaluation of the Tracking Outcomes and Practice in Paediatric 
Pulmonary Hypertension Registry (TOPP) and the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term Pulmonary 
Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL) has shown that 57% of the children with pulmonary 
hypertension had either idiopathic or familial disease and 36% had an underlying CHD (Barst et al. 2012, 
Berger et al. 2012, Zijlstra et al. 2014). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The distribution of PAH etiologies in children is slightly different from that in adults, with a larger 
proportion of PAH associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) in children, whereas in both 
populations, the majority of patients have idiopathic PAH (IPAH). According to different paediatric 
registries and surveys, IPAH and CHD-PAH account for about 90% of all paediatric PAH cases and thus 
present far the most important patient groups (Beghetti 2009). In PATENT-CHILD, 75% of subjects had a 
primary diagnosis of IPAH, and 16.7% had a diagnosis of CHD-PAH, while in PATENT-1 61.4% had a 
primary diagnosis of IPAH, followed by 25.1% diagnosed with connective tissue disease-associated PAH. 
These findings are consistent with major registries such as TOPP and REVEAL-CHILDREN (Barst et al. 
2012, Berger et al. 2012). 
PAH is a group of diseases characterized by an imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor 
activities, leading to increased vasoconstriction and remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature (National 
Pulmonary Hypertension Centres of the and Ireland 2008). The process of remodelling being accompanied 
by a worsening of endothelial function also includes intimal proliferation, which may result in complete 
occlusion of some vessels and is complicated by the development of thrombi in the small pulmonary 
arteries (Widlitz and Barst 2003).  
A number of mediators and growth factors have been shown to be involved in driving the cellular changes 
(Galie et al. 2004, Giaid et al. 1993). Increased circulating and local expression of endothelin-1 as well as 
serotonin is observed in subjects with PAH, while vasodilator pathways are deficient. Subjects with PAH 
produce less endothelial-derived prostacyclin and have a reduced expression of NO synthase and an 
increased production of vasoconstrictive thromboxane (Morrell et al. 2009), which has provided the 
rationale for therapies (Humbert et al. 2004, Humbert and Ghofrani 2016). 
Children have more pulmonary vascular medial hypertrophy, less intimal fibrosis and fewer plexiform 
lesions at presentation, and RH failure is less frequent than in adults. However, the variability in the 
phenotype is not necessarily indicative of a different primary mechanism but likely multifactorial and 
associated with epigenetic changes, gender and other factors such as inflammation. There are more 
similarities than differences in the characteristics of PAH in children and adults, resulting in guidelines 
recommending similar diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in children and adults (Rosenzweig et al. 
2019). Specifically, the amenability of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway to therapeutic interventions using 
riociguat has been demonstrated in multiple adult studies in PAH and CTEPH (Ghofrani et al. 2013a, 
Ghofrani et al. 2013b, Rubin et al. 2015, Simonneau et al. 2015). The vasoactive effects of cGMP-
enhancing therapies is reflected by hemodynamic parameters (PVRI and CI) that are predictive of 
outcome.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Historically, the definition of PH in children has been the same as in adults, i.e. mPAP ≥25 mmHg. 
However, due to variability in pulmonary hemodynamics during the post-natal transition, paediatric PH 
has been defined as mPAP ≥25 mmHg after 3 months of age. This was the definition applied in the 
paediatric PATENT-CHILD study conducted with riociguat. 
The 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) in 2018 proposed to modify the definition 
for PH in adults as mPAP >20 mmHg and to include PVR ≥3 Wood units (WU) to identify pre-capillary PH 
(Rosenzweig et al. 2019). The new definition is meanwhile recognized and is applied to paediatric 
subjects. However, paediatric patients having a mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg at rest were included in the PATENT-
CHILD study based on the previous definition in place at the start of the study in 2015 (Galie et al. 2009). 
Considering the different distribution of PH etiologies in children compared to adults (see below), PATENT-
CHILD enrolled paediatric PAH patients 6 to <18 years suffering from idiopathic PAH, hereditary PAH, and 
congenital heart disease-associated PAH after shunt closure (CHD-PAH). 
The symptoms of PAH include dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, palpitation, chest pain, syncope and cough, 
which are rarely present in the early stage. The disease is progressive and has a poor prognosis. When 
the subject presents with these symptoms, the conditions have often already advanced. Causes of 
elevated pulmonary arterial pressure are diverse, with the clinical classifications most recently updated in 
2018 at the 6th WSPH. Basically, the pathologic processes that characterize PAH are similar for adults 
and children (Barst et al. 2011). 
PAH remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in adults and children.  
There is still a high unmet medical need despite the availability and use of targeted therapies. The 1-, 3- 
and 5-year transplant-free survival (survival free from transplantation) in children with IPAH has been 
reported to be 89%, 76% and 54%, respectively. Overall survival was 89%, 84% and 74%, respectively, 
with 1 of 4 paediatric IPAH subjects dying within 5 years of presentation (Moledina et al. 2010). In a 
comparison between 3 referral centres with different populations of paediatric PAH subjects, unadjusted 
1-, 3-, and 5-year transplantation-free rates were 100%, 96% and 90% for New York; 95%, 87%, and 
78% for Denver; and 84%, 71%, and 62% for the Netherlands, respectively (Zijlstra et al. 2014). In the 
paediatric PAH cohort in the REVEAL registry in the US, 5-year survival from diagnosis for the overall 
cohort was 74 ±6%, with no significant difference between idiopathic/familial PAH and APAH-CHD cohorts 
(Barst et al. 2012). 
PH-related hospitalizations appear to have increased over the past decade; however, because of 
uncertain factors, such as earlier recognition of the disease, diagnosis of PH in more diverse settings, or 
improved care, hospital mortality has decreased during this period (Frank et al. 2015, Maxwell et al. 
2015). 
Management 
PAH in children is a progressive disease for which no cure is available. The most current approach in the 
management of paediatric PAH promotes the identification of appropriate targets for goal-oriented 
therapy. Determinants of paediatric idiopathic/heritable PAH risk allow for a risk stratification into two 
categories (lower risk and higher risk of poorer outcomes) (Rosenzweig et al. 2019). It can serve for 
example, to determine the need for additional therapy. As in adult subjects, determinants of higher risk in 
children include clinical evidence of right ventricular failure, progression of symptoms, WHO FC III or IV, 
significantly elevated or rising brain natriuretic peptide/N terminal pro type brain natriuretic peptide 
(BNP/ NT proBNP) levels, severe right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction and pericardial effusion.

EMA/229554/2023 
Page 9/103 
 
 
 
 
Additional hemodynamic parameters that predict higher risk include mPAP/mSAP ratio >0.75, mRAP >10 
mmHg, cardiac index <2.5 L/min/m2, and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) >20 WU*m2. 
Currently, the PDE5-inhibitor sildenafil (Revatio) and the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) 
ambrisentan (Volibris) are the only drugs approved for the treatment of paediatric PAH in Europe (Table 
1). The ERA bosentan (Tracleer) is recommended for paediatric use in guidelines and has information 
regarding PK and posology in the EU PI, but the indication does not specify use in paediatric age groups. 
The use of other ERAs and prostanoids in the treatment of paediatric PAH is common but off-label.

There is a high medical need for additional treatment options for PAH in light of the poor life expectancy 
and impact on the daily life of children and their relatives, and to provide treating physicians with suitable 
instructions and appropriate formulations for paediatric use. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mode of action 
Riociguat (Adempas) is a direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. sGC is a key enzyme in the 
cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for NO. It catalyses the generation of the signalling molecule 
cGMP, which plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes such as vascular tone, proliferation, 
fibrosis, and inflammation. Its dual mode of action riociguat directly stimulates sGC and synergizes with 
NO, restoring the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Importantly, riociguat exerts its biological effects 
independently of NO, which is present in low levels in some patients with CTEPH and PAH. 
Adempas that is currently approved in the EU in 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).  
The current indication for Adempas as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 mg film-coated tablets is as follows: 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 
Adempas is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III with 
• inoperable CTEPH,  
• persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, 
to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 11/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adempas, as monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO Functional Class (FC) II 
to III to improve exercise capacity. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including aetiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH or PAH 
associated with connective tissue disease (see section 5.1). 
The indication for Adempas proposed by the MAH is as follows: 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 
Adempas is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III with 
• inoperable CTEPH,  
• persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, 
to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1). 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
Adults 
Adempas, as monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists, is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO Functional Class (FC) II 
to III to improve exercise capacity. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including aetiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH or PAH 
associated with connective tissue disease (see section 5.1). 
Paediatrics 
Adempas is indicated for the treatment of PAH in paediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 
years of age with WHO Functional Class (FC) I to III in combination with endothelin receptor 
antagonists with or without prostanoids.  
The study establishing use included aetiologies of idiopathic PAH or hereditable PAH and PAH 
associated with congenital heart disease after surgical correction (see section 5.1). 
The posology proposed by the MAH for the paediatric indication is: 
Paediatric patients: 
Adempas is available for paediatric use as a tablet for those with body weight ≥50 kg. 
Titration of Adempas dose is to be performed based on the patient’s systolic blood pressure 
and general tolerability at the discretion of the treating physician/healthcare provider. If 
systolic blood pressure is ≥ 90 mmHg for the 6 to < 12 year age group or ≥ 95 mmHg for the 
12 to < 18 year age group and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, the 
dosage should be increased by 0.5 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg TID. 
If systolic blood pressure falls below these specified levels the dosage should be maintained 
provided the patient does not show any signs or symptoms of hypotension. If at any time 
during the up titration phase systolic blood pressure decreases below the specified levels or 
the patient shows signs and symptoms of hypotension the current dose should be decreased 
by 0.5 mg TID.

5.1.3 The development programme/compliance with guidance/scientific 
advice 
The paediatric program was designed to support two paediatric populations based on weight. Existing 
riociguat tablets (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 mg) support dosing in children with a body weight ≥50 kg, while 
new granules for oral suspension formulation was developed to support dosing in children with a body 
weight <50 kg. The MAH   decided to separate the submission of type II variation to add a paediatric 
indication to tablets (for children ≥50 kg) from that of the granules for oral suspension submission. 
Information for use in children with bodyweight ≥50 kg is included in the posology section. 
This application is based on the data obtained from the clinical program in the paediatric population 
comprising data from the 24-week main phase of the pivotal Phase 3 study PATENT-CHILD (Study 
15681), conducted in subjects ≥6 years to <18 years in the PAH indication. The study included children 
who received both tablets and granules for oral suspension formulations. Because the small size of 
PATENT-CHILD, the clinical experience for both formulations is presented in its totality to support the 
evaluation. This is considered acceptable as the dosing regimens for both formulations were designed to 
achieve systemic exposures in the range seen in adults. 
A waiver had been granted to exclude study in children from birth to <6 years because the specific 
medicinal product is likely to be unsafe due to the observation of bone effects in juvenile and adolescent 
rats.

The paediatric development program for riociguat was designed to address the following objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
Develop a dosing regimen for children aged between 6 and <18 years that results in 
riociguat exposures similar to levels observed in adult PAH patients dosed with 1 to 
2.5 mg tablets TID. 
Demonstrate that PK/PD relationship are similar between children and adults. 
Demonstrate the safety and tolerability of riociguat use for paediatric PAH 
The applicability of this extrapolation approach from adult data for the treatment of paediatric PAH has 
been accepted by EMA (EMEA-000718-PIP01-09-M06, September 2016).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Toxicology  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
At the initial MAA, two juvenile toxicity studies in rats have been assessed. In juvenile rats treated at 
doses of >10 mg/kg/day (10 times intended human exposure) with riociguat treatment starting at 
postnatal day (PND) 6 (corresponding to a human neonate age of <1 month) over a treatment period of 
about 3 weeks, thickening of trabecular bone and hypercellularity consisting of activated osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts were observed, and in addition hyperostosis and remodelling in the metaphyseal and 
diaphyseal bone was found. In contrast, in juvenile rats treated for 14 weeks starting at PND 6 with 
riociguat doses of up to 3 mg/kg/day (1 – 2 times the human exposure), no histopathological 
observations were made in the femur. Since it was expected that the Riociguat-induced bone lesions 
observed in juvenile rats might have relevance for the therapeutic application of riociguat in children, 
treatment of the paediatric population with riociguat was thought not to be justified at that moment. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Riociguat is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated with the extension to paediatric use.  
Therefore, riociguat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
At the initial MAA, two juvenile toxicity studies in rats have been assessed. In juvenile rats treated at 
doses of >10 mg/kg/day (10 times intended human exposure) with riociguat treatment starting at 
postnatal day (PND) 6 (corresponding to a human neonate age of <1 month) over a treatment period of 
about 3 weeks, thickening of trabecular bone and hypercellularity consisting of activated osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts were observed, and in addition hyperostosis and remodelling in the metaphyseal and 
diaphyseal bone was found. In contrast, in juvenile rats treated for 14 weeks starting at PND 6 with 
riociguat doses of up to 3 mg/kg/day (1 – 2 times the human exposure), no histopathological 
observations were made in the femur. Since it was expected that the Riociguat-induced bone lesions 
observed in juvenile rats might have relevance for the therapeutic application of riociguat in children, 
treatment of the paediatric population with riociguat was thought not to be justified at that moment. 
During a Pre-Submission in 2020, the Rapporteurs commented that safety data are very limited, 
especially for events that may take longer than 24 weeks (e.g. bone effects) but up to now comparable to 
adults, which is reassuring and asked if long-term safety data (from clinical LTE part of the study) will be 
submitted. The MAH  responded that no bone findings up to that point  had been seen in the main part 
and in the ongoing LTE. The MAH informed that  case of a grouped submission of extension of indication 
and line extension  in Q3 2022 more data from LTE would  be included in the dossier. The Rapporteurs

commented that use in children <6 y should not be suggested since the waiver below 6 y was based on 
the pre-clinical bone safety findings. This may lead to a contraindication. 
Now, the MAH has  discussed that  increased susceptibility of juvenile animals has not been observed, the 
bone findings were observed in the juvenile toxicity study at systemic exposure levels 10-fold higher than 
the AUC in the paediatric population, and the very rapid bone growth in rats compared to human 
childhood cannot directly be transferred to children due to species-specific differences in skeletal 
development and bone turnover. In line with this, in the PATENT-CHILD study in children of 6 years and 
older, no effects on bone growth or morphology were described. 
Riociguat is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated with the extension to paediatric use.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, the MAH sufficiently justified the safe use of riociguat in humans >6 
years old. 
Riociguat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment as no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated with the extension to paediatric use.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This application is based on the extrapolation of efficacy and safety in adults to the paediatric population 
based on comparable exposure.  
In relation to the pharmacokinetic support of this variation to include the paediatric population 6-<18 
years of age with PAH, results of the bioavailability Study 14986 and PK results of the Phase 3 paediatric 
Study 15681 (PATENT-CHILD) clinical study in paediatric PAH patients were provided. 
Bioanalytical methods. Plasma samples were analysed for riociguat and M-1 with analytical method SBQ-
14004 method, which was used in the package in support of the adult indication of Adempas.  
The stability of all analytes were established for the original marketing application for adult PAH and 
CTEPH. The stability was determined under sample handling and storage conditions and covered the 
interval from sampling to analysis. All analytes were stable under those conditions. Incurred sample 
reanalysis demonstrated the robustness of the analytical method. 
PopPK model. A PopPK model was developed in order to describe the PK in paediatric patients based on 
data from PATENT-CHILD Study 15681, in which paediatric patients received either the oral formulation 
of the tablet. The initial population PK model was a one-compartment model for riociguat, coupled to a 
one-compartment model for major metabolite M-1.

The number of subjects and PK samples in PATENT-CHILD Study 15681 was sparse and, therefore, the 
pre-existing adult data from PATENT-I/II were used to enrich the data set and as prior knowledge. The 
final popPK model included a description of metabolite M-1 formation from the parent drug in the central 
riociguat compartment, in combination with a direct appearance from the dose compartment. The model 
further included estimated allometric scaling that adequately described the data from both adult and 
paediatric PAH patients. Parameter estimates of the final popPK model is shown in Table 3

applied twice for CLM, V2 and V3. Therefore, the values of the estimates reported for WGHT on CLM, WGHT on V2 and WGHT on V3 are 
twice the NONMEM output.

The model was developed in an adequate manner, and, based on the provided GoF plots and pcVPC plots 
(Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6), yielded an adequate description of the riociguat and M-1 PK 
data, both in adults and in children.

Separate GoF plots were provided for children with the tablet formulation and children with the 
suspension. The model performed equally for both situations and for riociguat and for M-1. Therefore, the 
PK data generated by the developed popPK model are considered to provide an adequate estimation of 
the PK for riociguat and M-1 in the paediatric population in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681, and confirm 
bioequivalence of the oral suspension and tablet formulations.

PBPK model 
Using PBPK modelling, a dose scaling of riociguat from adult subjects to paediatric subjects with PAH has 
been performed, resulting in body weight-adjusted dosing for patients below 50 kg receiving oral liquid 
formulation. For paediatric subjects of body weight above 50 kg, the adult doses using the IR tablets was 
administered. 
ADME in paediatric population 
 No data on riociguat plasma protein binding specific to children is available. Steady-state volume of 
distribution (Vss) estimated via popPK modelling in children (age range 6 to <18 years) following oral 
administration of riociguat is 26 L on average, comparable to the volume of distribution in adults (30 L). 
No new data were provided regarding excretion and metabolism characteristics; the characteristics in 
adults are also considered applicable for the requested 6-<18  years patient population.  
In total, 76% (16/21) of the paediatric patients included in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681 at week 24 
ended up at the maximum 2.5 mg dose or the dose equivalent to that dose. 
Overall, the riociguat and M-1 PK profile was considered to be similar in children as in adults by the MAH.  
Comparison exposure in paediatric vs adult patients. Riociguat exposure in paediatric subjects with PAH 
was compared with the observed exposure in adult subjects with PAH included in the individual dose 
titration (IDT) arm in PATENT-1/2 studies. The observed plasma concentrations in paediatric subjects 
(PATENT-CHILD) overlapped with the observed concentrations in adult subjects with PAH (PATENT-1 and 
PATENT-2).  
For the comparison of PK parameters between adult subjects and paediatric subjects, adult reference 
groups were defined that closely resembled the paediatric PAH population with respect to age, 
background treatment, and being smokers or non-smokers. Smoking and concomitant administration of 
bosentan with riociguat alter riociguat plasma concentrations. In adult subjects, cigarette smoke reduced 
riociguat exposure by 2.3-fold on average. The effect of cigarette smoke on riociguat exposure showed 
high variability due to induction of CYP1A1 via polycyclic aromatic. CYP1A1 catalyses the formation of 
riociguat’s main metabolite M-1 in liver and lungs. Coadministration of bosentan, reported to be a 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4, led to a decrease of riociguat steady-state plasma concentrations in adult 
subjects with PAH by 27% on average.  
The selected adult subgroups were therefore non-smoking subjects with PAH below 45 years, with or 
without concomitant intake of bosentan during riociguat treatment. PATENT-CHILD includes only subjects 
on stable PAH therapy excluding smokers whereas PATENT-1 includes in addition to pre-treated subjects 
also naïve subjects and allowed smoking.  
The 75th percentile of riociguat area under the curve at steady state AUC(0-8h)ss in paediatric subjects is 
comparable to the lowest 25th percentile of adult subjects AUC for all comparison groups. Paediatric 
subjects receiving 2.5 mg (adult dose equivalents) showed higher exposures, thereby more resembling 
the values observed in adult subjects (Figure 7).

Whiskers (black vertical lines): range between lowest and highest observation. Box: range between 25th and 75th percentile. Black 
horizontal line: median of observations. Symbols: individual observations; shape determines formulation, color determines TID dosing 
level (dose equivalents). 
The median AUC(0-8h)ss in paediatrics subjects (525 µg·h/L) was 55% lower at week 24 than in adult 
subjects with PAH of the IDT arm in the PATENT-1/2 study (1163 µg·h/L). Factors that contributed to the 
lower exposure in paediatric subjects are the lower average maintenance dose of riociguat in PATENT-
CHILD compared to the average dose in PATENT-1/2 and the higher than predicted riociguat clearance in 
some paediatric subjects with PAH, who were mostly adolescent. 
Among the 24 paediatric subjects with PAH analysed in the population PK analysis, nine (37.5%) showed 
an estimated apparent riociguat plasma clearance that was above the 95th percentile predicted clearance 
by the PBPK model for the given age or body weight. The reason for the high clearance of these mostly 
adolescent paediatric subjects with PAH remains unknown but did not correlate with clinical worsening.  
The observed geometric means of estimated Cmax and Ctrough values were lower in paediatric subjects 
compared to adult subjects, respectively (Table 6).  
Table 5. Summary statistics of riociguat exposure measures at week 24. 
In addition, adult subjects with PAH showed higher riociguat exposure in comparison to adult healthy 
subjects (PK/PD Study 13817, Report PH-36960 in initial MAA dossier]). Paediatric patients included in 
PATENT-CHILD study were on stable treatment and PAH condition at baseline, and could be placed 
between healthy subjects and adult PAH patients from disease severity perspective. At baseline, most 
paediatric subjects in PATENT-CHILD had WHO functional class I or II (n=19, 79.2%), whereas most 
adult subjects in PATENT-1/2 had a WHO functional class of III (n=140, 55.1%). According to the MAH, 
this provides a potential explanation for the lower exposure in paediatric patients in comparison to adult 
PAH patients.

Bioequivalence. Dose normalized comparable bioavailability of riociguat and M-1 in terms of AUC and Cmax 
was demonstrated between each paediatric (0.15 mg, 0.3 mg and 2.4 mg) suspensions and the 
immediate-release tablet. Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the 2.4 mg and 0.3 mg suspensions 
as well. Therefore, using the oral suspension or the tablet at the same dose is expected to yield 
comparable exposure. Inclusion of the paediatric PK data obtained with the suspension as well as the 
tablet, despite the fact that only registration of the tablet for the new paediatric indication is requested, is 
therefore considered acceptable. This procedure is expected to increase the, though still limited, amount 
of paediatric PK data in support of this variation.  
Food. The food effect observed for the 0.15 mg/mL paediatric HC suspension was comparable to results 
reported for the currently registered IR tablet. Both the tablet as the suspension can be given regardless 
of food. 
Special patient populations. Due to the limited PK data available from paediatric patients, the influence of 
intrinsic factors on riociguat exposure could not be fully investigated. As an outcome of the exploratory 
covariate analyses, body weight, race or gender did not show a relevant impact of riociguat exposure in 
paediatric subjects. The same effects of intrinsic factors observed in adults should be considered for 
children and adolescents 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Riociguat is a direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. sGC is a key enzyme in the cardiopulmonary 
system and the receptor for NO. It catalyses the generation of the signalling molecule cGMP, which plays a 
pivotal role in regulating cellular processes such as vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. 
Its dual mode of action riociguat, directly stimulates sGC and synergizes with NO, restoring the NO-sGC-
cGMP pathway. Importantly, riociguat exerts its biological effects independently of NO, which is present in 
low levels in some patients with CTEPH and PAH.  
Exposure-Efficacy 
Paediatric population 
Right heart catheterization (RHC) to assess and follow up hemodynamic parameters in paediatric subjects 
with PAH enrolled in the PATENT-CHILD study was not indicated in the Clinical Study Protocol. This was 
consistent with RHC not being recommended in paediatric studies due to the high rate of serious 
complications (Ollivier et al. 2019). Since hemodynamic parameters measured via RHC were not obtained 
in PATENT-CHILD, a PK/PD analysis for hemodynamic parameters, e.g. pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR), cardiac index, etc, was not applicable. 
In the paediatric population, PK/PD relationships were investigated for the exercise capacity test 6-minute 
walking distance test (6MWD) and the biomarker NT-proBNP, a diagnostic biomarker for the presence of 
heart failure. For 6MWD, the change at week 24 (n=20) compared to baseline did not correlate with 
riociguat exposure (slope estimate [95 % CI]: 0.0070 m/(µg/L) [-0.685 to 0.699]) (Figure 8). For NT-
proBNP, the absolute decrease at week 24 showed a weak correlation with riociguat exposure (n=13) 
(slope estimate [95% CI]: -7.32 (pg/mL)/(µg/L) [-13.6 to -1.00]), but this correlation was mainly driven 
by three subjects with large absolute NT-proBNP changes in either the positive or negative direction 
(Figure 9). The ratio of NT-proBNP at week 24 to baseline showed no relationship to Ctrough, as the 95%

CI of the ratio included 0 (slope estimate [95% CI]: -0.0031 (pg/mL)/(µg/L) [-0.0076 to

Adults 
In healthy subjects and PH patients, there is a close and direct relationship between riociguat plasma 
concentrations and hemodynamic effects such as a decrease in systemic and pulmonary vascular 
resistance, a decrease in systolic blood pressure and an increase in cardiac output after administration of 
a wide range of single doses (0.5 – 5 mg) or at steady state (1.0 – 2.5 mg tid). 
In the adult PAH studies PATENT-1 (pivotal) and PATENT-2 (long-term extension), a negative relationship 
was found between the change in NT-proBNP and riociguat trough concentrations. The observed increase 
in 6MWD was not related to riociguat trough concentrations (PK/PD Study 18069). 
Comparisons of PK/PD relationship in paediatric subjects and adults with PAH 
The PK/PD relationships in paediatric subjects with PAH were compared with adult subjects with PAH. For 
the comparison, a ‘matched exposure’ subgroup was selected from PATENT-1/2 studies. This subgroup 
consists of adult subjects showing individual PK exposure (AUC(0-8h)ss) similar to the observed 
individuals' PK exposure (AUC(0-8h)ss) in paediatric subjects regardless of their background therapy or 
smoking status. 
The PK/PD data for 6MWD in paediatric PAH subjects were consistent with the data in adult subjects with 
PAH, as the increase in 6MWD was not related to riociguat trough concentrations (slope estimate [95% 
CI]: PATENT-CHILD: 0.0070 m/(µg/L) [-0.685 to 0.699]; “matched exposure” adults: 0.111 m/(µg/L) 
[0.406 to 0.628])(Figure 11).

The PATENT-CHILD PK/PD data for NT-proBNP are consistent with the data in adult PAH patients. A 
negative relationship was found between the change in NT-proBNP and riociguat trough concentrations in 
PATENT-CHILD (slope estimate [95% CI]: -7.32 (pg/mL)/(µg/L) [-13.6 to -1.00]). However, this 
relationship was mainly driven by three subjects with large absolute NT-proBNP changes. In the 
“exposure-matched” adult reference group, no relationship between change in NT-proBNP and riociguat 
trough concentrations was found (slope estimate [95% CI]: -1.68 (pg/mL)/(µg/L) [-4.75 to 
1.39])(Figure 12).

Change was derived as measure taken at visit 9 (week 24) minus the baseline measure for PATENT-CHILD. For 
PATENT-1/2, change from baseline was derived for the Long Term Extension Day 84. Circles: paediatric  subjects

lines: 95% confidence interval. 
Furthermore, no correlation can be seen between PK (Ctrough) and the change in systolic or diastolic 
blood pressure in the PATENT CHILD study nor in PATENT ½ (Figure 13 and Figure 14). There is a high 
interpatient variability for the PK of riociguat. The titration scheme has been established to adapt the 
dose to the individual tolerability of riociguat. Although a relatively high proportion (16/21, 76%) of the 
pediatric PAH subjects reached the maximum 2.5 mg dose, it cannot be concluded that a higher dose 
may lead to higher exposure and consequently a clinically significant decrease in blood pressure.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This application is based on the extrapolation of efficacy and safety in adults to the paediatric population 
based on comparable exposure.  
Bioanalytical methods. Plasma samples were analysed for riociguat and M-1 with the analytical method 
SBQ-14004 method, which was used in the package in support of the adult indication of Adempas.  
The bioanalytical method appears sufficiently validated. The distribution of the QCs is not in line with the 
requirements stated in the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical validation; however, in light of the 
requirements concerning QC distribution in the new ICH M10 guideline on bioanalytical method validation, 
this issue will not be pursued.  
PBPK model. Information on the development and validation of the PBPK model was only sparsely 
provided. However, since this PBPK study was used only to estimate the needed dose to obtain 
comparable exposure in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681 (with actual concentration determined later and 
used for further analysis), the impact of the PBPK model is considered limited. It is expected only to have 
affected internal decision-making by the MAH. Therefore, the lack of information on the PBPK model will 
not be further pursued. 
The mean exposure obtained in the paediatric population in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681 was 
somewhat lower due to a larger clearance in the actual study than predicted by the PBPK model. Without 
detailed validation data on the PBPK model, these differences remain unexplained. This issue will not be 
further pursued. However, the reported lower exposure obtained in the paediatric population as compared 
to the adult population was further discussed concerning the expected efficacy in this population as 
detailed below.   
ADME in the paediatric population. Overall, the MAH  considered the riociguat and M-1 PK profiles similar 
in children and adults. However, although the riociguat AUC(0-8h)ss exposure in paediatric subjects is within 
the range of the observed exposure in adult subjects with PAH, the mean exposure in paediatric subjects 
is lower than in adult PAH patients, i.e., towards the 25th percentile for all comparison groups. It was 
shown that for a major part of the paediatric subjects (9/24) dosed in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681, 
clearance was higher than predicted from the PBPK model. Population PK analysis showed a comparable 
PK profile in paediatric subjects after administration of oral tablets or granules for suspension (popPK/PD 
Study 18069); therefore, this is not expected to contribute to the observed differences between 
paediatric and adult exposure.  
Part of the observed difference in exposure appears to be caused by the lower dose-equivalents for 
children in the maintenance phase of PATENT-CHILD than for the adult population. In the adult individual 
dose titration reference group the average dose administered was 2.36 mg TID, while for children the 
average dose equivalent was 2.10 mg TID, and therefore 11% lower. It is agreed that this may partially 
contribute to the lower exposure observed in the paediatric population as compared to adults in the 
overall population. In line with this finding, comparing exposure in paediatric patients receiving the 2.5 
mg adult equivalent dose and adults receiving the 2.5 mg maximum adult dose indeed yields a somewhat 
less reduced exposure in the paediatric population than upon comparing the full paediatric and full adult 
population. 
However, the difference in received (dose-equivalent) dose does not explain the difference in exposure 
between adult and paediatric patients completely. For the remainder of the decreased exposure in the 
paediatric population, the MAH argues that this is largely caused by a subgroup of paediatric patients (9 
out of 24, of which 2 patients terminated the study in the titration phase) with noticeable increased 
clearance. Since 7 of the 9 paediatric patients with increased clearance were 13 years of older (and two 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 30/103 
 
 
 
 
 
were 6 and 7 years old), the MAH  hypothesizes that this may be caused by exposure of these 
adolescents to enzyme-inducing tobacco smoke that may be encountered by these subjects. This 
argumentation is not fully agreed. It is agreed that induction of CYP1A2 may lead to reduced exposure to 
riociguat. However, in such case one would also expect an increase in metabolite M1 in these subjects. 
However, exposure to M-1 does not appear to be increased as compared to that in adults. Instead, also 
for M-1, exposure appears to be low in the paediatric population as compared to adults. Therefore, 
induction of CYP1A2 is expected not to provide an explanation for the reduced exposure to riociguat in 
the paediatric population. 
As proposed by the MAH, different WHO functional classes in paediatric and adult patients, and the 
already known differences in exposure between healthy subjects and adult patients may provide a 
potential explanation for the lower exposure in paediatric patients in comparison to adult PAH patients. It 
is notable that the WHO functional class was not included as a covariate in the popPK model. Upon 
request by CHMP, the MAH  discussed the  option to include this as a covariate in the model. A trend for 
increased exposure in more severe WHO functional classes was observed in adult patients, with mean 
exposure in WHO FC2 and FC3 increased by 10% and 25% as compared to that in adult WHO FC1 
patients. The paediatric population consisted almost exclusively of WHO FC2 patients (21 out of 24). In 
the paediatric WHO FC2 group, exposure was markedly lower (estimated appr 50%) than that observed 
in the adult WHO FC2 group, whereas exposure in the FC3 group was roughly comparable to that in the 
adult FC3 group. However, CHMP  agreed that the number of subject in the paediatric FC3 group is too 
small (i.e. n=3) to allow drawing firm conclusions on a potential FC dependency of the difference in 
riociguat exposure between paediatric and adult patients. Since the observed trend of a lower exposure in 
the paediatric population is indicated not to affect efficacy the potential FC dependency of the difference 
in exposure between paediatric and adult patients will not be pursued further. 
Nevertheless, the observed, and as yet not fully explained reduced exposure in the paediatric population 
as compared to adults does not appear to result in reduced efficacy, when comparing the efficacy (6-
minute walking distance) of the paediatric patients with that in adults and with the other paediatric 
patients. More specifically, 5 of the 7 patients with unexpectedly high riociguat clearance showed an 
increase in 6MWD of > 20 meter, which is considered clinically relevant.  
In conclusion, based on sparse sampling, riociguat and M-1 PK data in the paediatric population aged 6-
<18 years of age has been provided. Although the PK appears roughly comparable, the mean riociguat 
and M-1 exposure in paediatric subjects are clearly lower than in adult PAH patients, i.e., towards the 
25th percentile for all comparison groups. Nevertheless, the observed, and as yet not fully explained 
reduced exposure in the paediatric population as compared to adults does not appear to result in reduced 
efficacy, when comparing the efficacy (6-minute walking distance) of the paediatric patients with that in 
adults and with the other paediatric patients. More specifically, 5 of the 7 patients with unexpectedly high 
riociguat clearance showed an increase in 6MWD of > 20 meter, which is considered clinically relevant. 
These findings are consistent with the corresponding PK/PD profiles in adult subjects with PAH, i.e. no 
clear relationship between changes in 6MWD and riociguat trough concentrations (see also below). 
Exposure-efficacy. In the paediatric PAH population, PK/PD relationships were investigated for the 6MWD 
and NT-proBNP. No PK/PD relationship was observed between riociguat exposure and 6MWD. Further, a 
weak negative relationship was found between the change in NT-proBNP and riociguat exposure, but this 
relationship was mainly driven by three subjects with large absolute NT-proBNP changes in either the 
positive or negative direction. The ratio of NT-proBNP at week 24 to baseline showed no relationship to 
riociguat exposure. 
The PK/PD relationships in paediatric subjects with PAH were compared with adult subjects with PAH 
using the “matched exposure” subgroup of the PATENT-1/2 studies. Overall, the PK/PD profiles for 6MWD 
and NT-proBNP at week 24 in paediatric subjects are consistent to the corresponding PK/PD profiles in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 31/103 
 
 
 
 
adult subjects with PAH, i.e. no relationship between changes in NT-proBNP nor 6MWD and riociguat 
trough concentrations were observed. Additionally,  no correlation can be seen between riociguat 
exposure and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure both in adults and in the paediatric 
population. Nevertheless, in adults, a PK/PD relationship was established for hemodynamic parameters 
such as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) obtained via right heart 
catheterization (RHC). In contrast, in PATENT-CHILD a RHC for assessing and following up hemodynamic 
parameters was not performed because it is not recommended for pediatric studies (Ollivier et al. 2019). 
As such, the justification that similar exposures result in similar pharmacodynamic effects is limited (see 
“Clinical efficacy” for further discussion).  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on sparse sampling, riociguat and M-1 PK data in the paediatric population aged 6-<18 years of 
age appears roughly comparable, although the mean riociguat and M-1 exposure in paediatric subjects 
are clearly lower than in adult PAH patients, i.e., towards the 25th percentile for all comparison groups. 
This effect is only partially explained by the lower dose-equivalents for children in the maintenance phase 
of PATENT-CHILD than for the adult population and the presence of increased riociguat clearance in a part 
of the paediatric population. Nevertheless, the observed, and as yet not fully explained, reduced exposure 
in the paediatric population as compared to adults does not appear to result in reduced efficacy, when 
comparing the efficacy (6-minute walking distance) of the paediatric patients with that in adults and with 
the other paediatric patients. More specifically, 5 of the 7 patients with unexpectedly high riociguat 
clearance showed an increase in 6MWD of > 20 meters, which is considered clinically relevant. These 
findings are consistent with the PK/PD profiles in both the adult and the paediatric population, i.e. no 
relationship between changes in NT-proBNP nor 6MWD and riociguat trough concentrations were 
observed. Therefore, the justification that similar exposures result in similar pharmacodynamic effects is 
limited. Nevertheless, the extrapolation of data is acceptable given the favourable trend in 6MWD in the 
direction of the adult population and the similar safety profiles between adults and the paediatric 
population.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
It is widely accepted that it is often not feasible to perform statistically powered clinical studies for 
efficacy in children, as is done for adults; this is particularly valid for PAH, which is considered to be a 
rare disease in adults and has an even lower incidence in children (Barst et al. 2011). The EMA guideline 
regarding clinical investigations for medicinal products targeting pediatric PAH allows for extrapolation 
when the benefit-risk has been characterized in adults. In these cases, the development program focuses 
on defining the therapeutic dose and collecting data on short- and long-term safety (EMA 2012). 
Therefore, the application assumes that similar exposures and pharmacodynamic effects in children, as 
compared to adults, will result in similar efficacy in children. In this respect, a physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling study (study 15463) has been conducted to predict the 
pharmacokinetic properties of riociguat in the pediatric population. Additionally, the MAH had conducted a 
Phase 3 open-label, individual dose titration Study 15681 (PATENT-Child) to assess the PK, safety and 
exploratory efficacy in paediatric PAH patients aged 6-18 years (Table 7). Further, to allow clinical 
comparisons, paediatric data are displayed side-by-side with pooled data from the phase 3 studies in 
adults (PATENT-1 and PATENT-2), within the first 24 weeks of treatment.

Extrapolation concept 
Two studies in adult PAH subjects were used for the purposes of extrapolation. PATENT-1 was a 12-week 
safety and efficacy study of riociguat, while PATENT-2, its companion long-term extension study, 
continued treatment and efficacy evaluations. PATENT-2 includes an efficacy evaluation after additional 
12 weeks of treatment that can be aligned with the 24-week endpoint from PATENT-CHILD.  
There are several considerations that justify the overall approach to extrapolate efficacy from adults. 
These considerations are consistent with those expressed in the EMA reflection paper on extrapolation 
(EMA 2018) as well as in the current draft ICH E11A guideline on paediatric extrapolation (EMA 2022). 
Development of a paediatric extrapolation concept requires an understanding of the factors that influence 
the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the response to therapy as well as the safety 
of use in all the relevant populations. 
- 
- 
- 
The pathophysiology of PAH is similar among children enrolled in PATENT-CHILD (6 to <18 years) 
and adults (Barst et al. 2011). 
The hemodynamic mechanism of action of riociguat as an sGC stimulator is responsible for PAH 
efficacy is expected to be similar in adults and children.  
PK exposures in paediatric subjects in PATENT-CHILD are within the range of exposures observed 
in adult PAH subjects. Adult PAH clinical studies have shown a direct relationship between 
riociguat plasma concentrations and invasively obtained hemodynamic parameters such as SVR, 
SBP, PVR, and cardiac output. 
- 
The safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints of the paediatric PATENT-CHILD study allow for 
comparison to the results from adult riociguat PAH studies. In addition, positive clinical outcomes 
were observed in the target paediatric population. 
The comparison is considered valid because the adult PATENT-1/2 and PATENT-CHILD consist of similar 
patient populations who were being treated consistent with existing guidelines. 
Therefore, the paediatric development program for riociguat was designed to address the following 
objectives:

• 
• 
• 
Develop a dosing regimen for children aged between 6 and <18 years that results in 
riociguat exposures similar to levels observed in adult PAH patients dosed with 1 to 
2.5 mg tablets TID. 
Demonstrate that PK/PD relationships are similar between children and adults. 
Demonstrate the safety and tolerability of riociguat use for paediatric PAH 
The applicability of this extrapolation approach from adult data for the treatment of paediatric PAH has 
been accepted by EMA (EMEA-000718-PIP01-09-M06, September 2016). 
5.4.2 Dose-response studies  
Paediatric dose selection for PATENT-CHILD was based on: 
•  A relative bioavailability study 14986 comparing the paediatric granules for oral suspension 
formulation to the approved film-coated tablets showing that the tablets and granules for oral 
suspension formulations have comparable bioavailability; and  
•  A population physiology-based PK (PBPK) modeling study (15463) to identify a paediatric dosing 
regimen that would result in paediatric exposures similar to adult exposures. The doses selected 
for PATENT-CHILD were calculated based on predicted PK exposure in paediatric patients. This 
resulted in decision to use already available tablet strengths 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg for children 
with bodyweight ≥50 kg and a granules for oral suspension formulation for children with 
bodyweight <50 kg. 
The dosing regimens for both tablet and granules for oral suspension formulations were aimed at 
achieving systemic exposures in the range of that seen in adult PAH patients.

Treatments 
Study 15681 was composed of two parts: 
•  Main study part (Figure 15): 
o  A pre-treatment screening period up to 2 weeks to identify potential eligibility of 
subjects who had been diagnosed with PAH. This visit was to take place up to 2 weeks 
before Visit 1 (baseline visit). 
o  A 24-week main period that included an 8-week titration phase and a 16-week 
maintenance phase 
o  Follow-up period: safety follow-up visit to be performed 60 (±8) days after last study 
medication intake for all subjects who did not enter the LTE part or who stopped the 
study medication prematurely. Serious adverse events were to be followed up for at 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 35/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least 60 days (only for subjects who did not enter the LTE part or who stopped the 
study medication prematurely). 
• 
Long-term extension (LTE) part 
o  Extension phase to allow participants to continue to receive riociguat until market 
approval of riociguat for the paediatric population or until a subjects turns 18 years of 
age (whichever came first).  
o  Follow-up period: safety follow-up visit to be performed 60 (+8) days after last study 
medication intake for all subjects stopping study medication either at the end of the 
LTE or prematurely discontinuing the study at any time. 
The LTE phase is still ongoing. For this submission, data until the cut-off date 07 Jan 2022 
are included. 
Figure 15. Main study part design 
Dosing regimen 
All subjects received body-weight-adjusted dose of riociguat to achieve a similar exposure as that 
observed in adults treated for PAH. The dose titration and maintenance dose was based on bodyweight, 
systolic blood pressure, and whether the participant showed signs of hypotension. 
Subjects <50 kg at baseline received riociguat oral suspension during the initial 24-week main treatment 
period. Subjects ≥50 kg at baseline received oral tablets. If the BW decreased below 50 kg, then the 
IxRS delivered the oral suspension. 
The starting dose was the body weight-adjusted equivalent of the 1.0 mg dose in adults (Table 9). The 
individual titration phase comprised 4 visits which were 2 weeks (±2 days) apart. The last dose 
administered at Visit 4 (Week 8) was regarded as an individual optimal dose, and subjects received that 
treatment during the 16-week maintenance phase. Down-titration was permitted at all times for safety 
reasons.

Formulations 
Two formulations were used in the PATENT-CHILD study: 
- 
Immediate release (IR) tablet formulation (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5-mg strengths) was used for 
children with bodyweight ≥50 kg, and is identical to the formulation used in the clinical studies 
that supported riociguat approval for PAH and CTEPH in the adult population. 
-  Granules-for-oral-suspension (0.15 mg/mL) was a new paediatric formulation created to fulfil the 
PIP requirement to develop an oral liquid age-appropriate formulation. Study 14986 
demonstrated the bioavailability of riociguat and its main metabolite (BAY 60-4552). AUC and 
Cmax were comparable between the paediatric formulation and the standard IR tablet. The 
granules-for-oral-suspension formulation was used to support bodyweight-adjusted dosing in 
children with a bodyweight below 50 kg using a dosing regimen based on pharmacokinetic 
modelling. 
Participants were able to switch between oral suspension and tablet formulations due to bodyweight 
changes. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral 
riociguat treatment. 
The secondary objectives of this study were evaluation of exploratory efficacy outcomes to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic profile of riociguat. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The secondary outcomes were the assessment of:  
• 
the change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 24) of the following variables: 
o  6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) 
o  WHO functional class 
o  NT-proBNP or BNP (when both tests are available, NT-proBNP was to be chosen over BNP)

o  Quality of life scores (parent questionnaire and in subjects able to understand questions):

 
pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP),  
right ventricular pressure by tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity,

and 
• 
time to clinical worsening defines as: 
o  Hospitalization for right heart failure 
o  Death 
o 
Lung transplantation 
o  Pott’s anastomosis and atrioseptostomy 
o  Worsening of PAH symptoms, which must include either: 
 
 
an increase in WHO FC, or 
appearance/worsening symptoms of right heart failure, and need for additional 
PAH therapy. 
Other outcome was assessed as a change in right heart catheterization (RHC) parameters (if available) 
obtained from RHC performed before study enrollment and during study conduct. The above efficacy 
variables were collected at baseline and Week 24 in the main study part and were to be collected every 3 
to 4 months in the LTE part. 
Sample size 
At least 20 subjects on treatment with bosentan or other ERAs had to be enrolled in the study. The 
sample size did not originate from a formal sample size calculation but was based on an evidence-based 
feasibility assessment. Based on the results of the evidence-based feasibility survey (Davie, 2014) and 
the proposed PK evaluation, 20 subjects would permit an accurate PK evaluation and feasibility of the 
study in a reasonable time frame. Every effort was to be made to enroll equal numbers of patients in both 
age cohorts.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study concerned a single arm, open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy outcomes were evaluated in an exploratory manner based on the safety analysis set (SAF), 
i.e. subjects who were assigned to receive study medication and had received at least one dose of the 
study medication. Unless otherwise specified, baseline was the last available non-missing value prior and 
up to the time of the first intake of study medication, i.e. first dose of riociguat. Change from baseline 
was calculated as the value at the post-baseline time point minus the baseline value. Subgroup analyses 
were performed by age cohort (≥6 to <12 years and ≥12 to <18 years) and by concomitant PAH 
medication (ERA only, ERA+PCA, PCA only) specified at screening. 
Results 
Participant flow  
Twenty-four subjects (6 subjects in the ≥6 to <12 years and 18 subjects in the ≥12 to <18 years cohort) 
entered the main treatment period and received the study drug (riociguat), also known as the safety 
analysis set (SAF), of which 21 (87.5%) subjects completed the 24-week main treatment period and 
entered the optional LTE part (Figure 16). Three (12.5%) subjects did not complete the main treatment 
period and the reason for non-completion was adverse events. Of these 3 subjects, 1 subject completed 
the safety follow-up visit and 2 subjects did not complete the safety follow-up visit due to being lost to 
follow-up.  
Of the 21 subjects entering the LTE part, 8 were still in the study at the data cut-off date (07 JAN 2022). 
Thirteen subjects terminated the LTE part, 5/13 (38.5%) completed the LTE treatment period per 
protocol as they reached the age of 18 years, and 8/13 (61.5%) did not complete the LTE treatment 
period. The main reasons for non-completion were adverse events and physician’s decision (3 subjects 
[23.1%], each). It is to be noted that the 3 subjects who were withdrawn by physicians' decision 
continued on commercial Adempas. No Covid-19 pandemic-related reasons for non-completion were 
reported. No clinically relevant differences for non-completion were reported by age cohort or by 
concomitant PAH medication.

Note: The technical report PH-42339 shows the data from children receiving both tablet and oral suspension 
formulations, comprising the main and the LTE part up to the cut-off date 07 JAN 2022. 
For one subject, the end-of-treatment CRF page was erroneously filled-in. It was confirmed by the investigator that the 
subject was not discontinued by the CDB date of 07 JAN 2022. In consequence, the number of subjects still in the LTE 
part at that date was 8 (instead of 7). The number of subjects having not completed the LTE phase was 8 (instead of 
9), accordingly. 
Formulations 
A total of 16 children started the study on suspension, while 8 started on riociguat tablets. Of the 16 who 
started on suspension, 6 switched to tablets at some point during their participation. All switches 
happened at Week 24 or later. At the time of the data cut-off for the LTE (07 JAN 2022), of the 8 children 
still in the study, only 3 remained on suspension, while the remaining 5 were receiving tablets. One child 
who switched to tablets briefly switched back to suspension due to bodyweight fluctuation. There were no 
instances where a child started on tablets and switched to granules for oral suspension. 
Drug dose 
At the end of the 8-week titration phase (Visit 5), 16 (72.7%) subjects were on the highest riociguat dose 
of 2.5 mg or the body-weight equivalent, 1 (4.5%) subject each was on 2.0 mg, on 1.5 mg, and on 1.0 
mg, and 3 (13.6%) subjects were on 0.5 mg or the respective body-weight equivalent.

Protocol deviations 
In the SAF, a total of 9 (37.5%) subjects were reported with important protocol deviations (Table 10). 
Six (25.0%) subjects did not meet all the inclusion criteria or met at least one exclusion criterion but 
entered treatment. Three (12.5%) subjects had procedure deviations and 3 (12.5%) subjects had 
treatment deviations.

Recruitment 
A total of 26 subjects were screened in 16 study centres in 9 countries or regions: Colombia (n=1), 
Germany (n=5), Hungary (n=2), Italy (n=3), Japan (n=6), Mexico (n=4), Poland (n=2), Taiwan (n=2) 
and Turkey (n=1). Two subjects did not pass the screen of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 24 subjects 
entered the main treatment period and received the study drug (riociguat) 
The first subject's first visit was on 29 October 2015, and the last visit (main study part) was on 7 March 
2020.  
Conduct of the study 
A total of 14 amendments (6 global and 8 local) to the original protocol (finalized on 13 Mar 2015) has 
been made. Key efficacy changes appear to have been made in Amendment 3 “Pharmacodynamics was 
deleted from primary objective”. Nevertheless, a description of the modification revealed that the original 
protocol described PD as a primary and secondary objective but elsewhere in the protocol PD was 
described as secondary/other objective. To keep consistency, the PD is deleted from the primary 
objective.

Baseline data 
Of the 24 subjects in the SAF, 13 (54.2%) were male. The mean age was 12.8 years. Mean weight was 
46.44 kg and mean height was 155.06 cm. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally 
balanced across concomitant PAH medications groups (Table 11). In the younger cohort, the proportion 
of male subjects was 33.3%, while in the older cohort, it was 61.1%. Concomitant PAH medication at 
baseline was comparable in the two age-cohorts, with about two-third of subjects receiving ERA only and 
one-third receiving ERA and PCA. 
In the younger cohort, all 6 subjects had a body-weight <50 kg; in the older cohort, 10 subjects had a 
body-weight ≥50 kg, and 8 subjects had a body weight <50 kg. Fifteen subjects(62.5%) were on ERA-
only at screening, and 9 (37.5%) subjects were on ERA+PCA. No subjects were on PCA only. 
The most common type of PAH was idiopathic PAH (18 [75.0%] subjects)( 
Table 12). Idiopathic PAH was the primary diagnosis for 15/18 subjects aged ≥12 to <18 years compared 
to 3/6 subjects aged ≥6 to <12 years. In the younger cohort, PAH associated with congenital heart 
disease was reported for 2/6 subjects (33.3%) vs 2/18 subjects (11.1%) in the older cohort.  
At baseline, a majority of subjects (18 [75.0%]) had a WHO functional class of II with no notable 
differences across age- and concomitant PAH medication subgroups, which is consistent with the TOPP 
registry (Berger et al. 2012). The mean 6MWD (SD) was 442.12 (109.67) m. The median NT-proBNP 
level was 202.00 pg/mL (range: 22.0 to 4440.0 pg/mL). The SF-10 physical and psychosocial summary 
scores were similar across age and concomitant PAH medication subgroups. The bone age for a majority 
of subjects was in accordance with the chronological age (12 [50.0%]) or advanced (10 [41.7%]) 
compared to the chronological age. The results of bone morphology for all 23 subjects who were assessed 
at baseline were normal.

General medical history 
The most frequently reported preferred terms were pulmonary arterial hypertension (62.5%), pulmonary 
hypertension (33.3%), right ventricular hypertrophy (25.0%) and rhinitis allergic (20.8%). 
The results were comparable across age groups and concomitant PAH medications. 
Specific PAH medications 
Subjects must be on standard-of-care PAH medications, allowing ERA and/or PCAs for at least 12 weeks 
prior to the baseline visit. Intake of PDE5 inhibitors was not allowed during the study. The most 
frequently used specific PAH medications as prior medications were bosentan (62.5%) and sildenafil 
(37.5%) (Table 13). Bosentan was reported as a concomitant medication for 62.5% of subjects. There 
were 3 subjects who reported concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors;  1 subject received PDE5 inhibitor 
(sildenafil) and 2 subjects received non-specific PDE inhibitors. In one subject, riociguat treatment was 
stopped before starting remedial therapy with sildenafil, therefore, no protocol deviation for concomitant 
PDE5 inhibitor therapy was recorded. In the other 2 subjects, concomitant uses of non-specific PDE 
inhibitors were reported, however, adverse events reported during this period were not seen as a result 
of a possible drug-drug interaction.

Outcomes and estimation 
6MWD 
An improvement in physical capacity (6MWD) with a mean change of 23.01 m was seen between baseline 
and Week 24 (Table 14). With the limitations of small sample size and potential random findings, 
improvement (positive mean change) of 6MWD from baseline was seen in both age subgroups and the 
subgroup of subjects receiving ERA+PCA as concomitant PAH medications but not in those receiving ERA 
only.

During the optional LTE phase, the mean changes from baseline in 6MWD for eligible subjects on 
treatment were 5.86 m (SD 44.56; n=16) at Month 6, -3.43 m (SD 74.77, n=12) at Month 12; 28.98 m 
(SD 66.71, n=9) at Month 18, and - 11.80 m (SD 35.40, n=4) at Month 24. Considering the low subject 
numbers, comparable changes were also seen in both age subgroups and in the subgroup of subjects 
receiving ERA+PCA as concomitant PAH medications. In the subgroup of subjects receiving ERA only, 
maintenance was reported for up to 2 years of treatment duration. 
Responder analyses showed that 9 of 19 participants in PATENT-CHILD (47.4 %; 3 participants ≥6 to <12 
years and 6 participants ≥12 to <18 years subgroups) had an improvement by at least 20 m at Week 24 
compared with baseline (Figure 17). Regarding LTE, an improvement by at least 20 m was observed in 
8/16 (50.0%), 4/12 (33.3%), 5/9 (55.6%) and 1/4 participant (25.0%) at months 6, 12, 18 and 24 in 
assessable patients.

NT-proBNP 
For 9/24 (37.5%) of subjects, NT-proBNP data has not been collected at baseline. 
For subjects with NT-proBNP values available (n=15) at baseline, the mean NT-proBNP was 982.68 
pg/mL, and the median was 202.00 pg/mL (Table 15). Of note, the SD (1595.77) was very large, and 
means and medians were not comparable. The median baseline NT-proBNP was higher in the subgroup of 
subjects of ≥12 to <18 years compared with those of ≥6 to <12 years and was higher in the subgroup of 
subjects receiving ERA only as compared with those receiving ERA+PCA as concomitant PAH medications. 
An improvement with a mean change of –65.77 pg/mL and a median change of –12.05 pg/mL was seen 
between baseline and Week 24 and were consistent with the key findings for 6MWD. The improvement 
(negative median change) of NT-proBNP from baseline was also seen in the subgroup of subjects 
receiving ERA+PCA (but not in those receiving ERA only) and the subgroup of subjects of ≥6 to <12 years 
but not in the older subgroup. 
During the optional LTE phase, the mean changes from baseline for NT-proBNP for eligible subjects on 
treatment were -291.05 pg/mL (median 0.00; n=11) at Month 6, -222.78 pg/mL (median -5.50, n=12) 
at Month 12; -283.40 pg/mL (median -8.00, n=9) at Month 18, and -270.93 pg/mL (median -243.00, 
n=4) at Month 24. 
When both tests were available at a site, NT-proBNP was to be chosen over BNP, and the same test was 
to be performed at every required visit. For subjects who had BNP values available (n=7) at baseline, the 
mean BNP was 10.46 pg/mL, and the median was 7.30 pg/mL. Between baseline and Week 24 (n=6), 
BNP values slightly increased with a mean change of 7.45 pg/mL and a median change of 1.25 pg/mL.

Clinical worsening 
Up to Week 24, 2 (8.3%) subjects were reported with an event of clinical worsening as hospitalization for 
right heart failure. Both subjects were in the subgroup of ≥12 to <18 years, and one subject each 
received ERA only or ERA+PCA as concomitant PAH medication. The planned Kaplan-Meier analysis for 
the main phase is not presented here because few subjects experienced an event of clinical worsening. 
Between the LTE start and data cut-off date, 6 subjects of the older age cohort were reported with clinical 
worsening (Table 16).

“PCA” includes prostacyclin analogues and receptor agonists  
WHO functional class 
The majority of subjects (18 [75.0%]) had a WHO functional class of II at baseline. Five (20.8%) subjects 
had a WHO FC III, and 1 subject (4.2%) had WHO FC I. No subjects reported a change in WHO functional 
class between baseline and Week 24. 
During the LTE phase, the majority of subjects who reached Month 24 (6/7 [85.7%]) remained stable 
regarding WHO functional class II with one subject showing improvement. Results were consistent 
between age and concomitant PAH medication subgroups. 
QoL 
For SF-10 physical and psychosocial summary scores, an improvement was seen between baseline and 
Week 24, respectively (Table 17). The same holds true for the PedsQL total scale score and the PedsQL 
physical health summary score, and PedsQL psychosocial health summary score between baseline and 
Week 24, respectively (Table 18). For the PedsQL subdomains physical functioning and school 
functioning dimensions, an improvement was seen in both age subgroups between baseline and Week 24. 
In contrast, for the PedsQL subdomains' emotional functioning and social functioning dimensions, an 
improvement was seen in the younger subgroup only.

During the LTE phase, continuous trends in further improvements in the SF-10 physical and psychosocial 
summary scores and the PedsQL total scale, physical health summary, and psychosocial health summary 
scores (including subdomains) were reported.

•  At baseline, the mean right atrial systolic area was 12.017 (SD 9.391) cm2. At Week 24 (Visit 9), 
a mean change of 0.424 (SD 3.758) cm2 was observed. 
•  At baseline, the mean right atrial systolic area index was 8.996 (SD 6.021). At Week 24 (Visit 9), 
a mean change of 0.329 (SD 2.417) was observed.

(Visit 9), a mean change of –4.3% (SD 7.3%) was observed. 
•  At baseline, the mean right ventricular diastolic area was 27.155 (SD 11.993) cm2. At Week 24 
(Visit 9), a mean change of 0.618 (SD 4.519) cm2 was observed. 
•  At baseline, the mean right ventricular diastolic area index was 20.722 (SD 6.564). At Week 24 
(Visit 9), a mean change of 0.451 (SD 3.562) was observed.

24 (Visit 9), a mean change of 5.7 (49.0) mmHg was observed. 
•  At baseline, the mean TAPSE was 18.82 (SD 4.21) mm. At Week 24 (Visit 9), a mean change of –
1.27 (SD 3.87) mm was observed. 
•  At baseline, the mean tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity was 4.915 (SD 1.100) m/s. At Week 
24 (Visit 9), a mean change of –0.085 (SD 0.726) m/s was observed. 
Overall, the number of subjects enrolled and with echocardiographic evaluation was small, and for 
certain parameters, only a few subjects (pericardial effusion [1 subject], systolic PAP [3]) had 
assessments at both baseline and Week 24 to allow for analysis of the change. Evaluation of the 
mean changes in this small population did not allow to identify trends across all parameters. 
The same holds true for the echocardiographic data reported during the LTE phase.

PATENT-2), within the first 24 weeks of treatment, to allow clinical comparisons. To note: the use of the 
PATENT-1 and PATENT-2 populations for comparison is considered acceptable as the aetiology of IPAH, 
FPAH, and some associated forms (e.g. APAH associated with CHD) is comparable in paediatric and adult 
PAH, although there are some differences in the proportions of the individual underlying causes of APAH 
(e.g., CTD vs CHD).  
Statistical methods for the integrated analysis 
As the study duration of PATENT-1 (12 weeks) was shorter than the duration of the main study part of 
PATENT-CHILD, data from subsequent treatment weeks from the open-label LTE study PATENT-2 were 
also taken into account up to a total of 24 weeks of observation in order to have a similar observation 
period of 24 weeks for adults and children. Only subjects randomized to the riociguat IDT group 
(individual up-titration up to 2.5 mg) of PATENT-1 were taken into account for the integrated analysis of 
efficacy (N=254). In addition, for a direct comparison of responses between adults and paediatric 
patients, a ‘matched exposure’ group from the adult population was selected (N=33). This ‘matched 
exposure’ consists of adult subjects showing individual PK exposure (AUC(0 8h)ss) similar to the observed 
individuals' PK exposure (AUC(0-8h)ss) in paediatric subjects regardless of their background therapy or 
smoking status. No statistical comparisons were performed. 
The following treatment labels were used in the side-by-side presentation of the adult data with the 
paediatric data:

Baseline data comparison 
Baseline characteristics were comparable in both pooled groups of adult subjects apart from median NT-
proBNP levels at baseline (pg/mL) (Pool 1: 389.5; Pool 1 [matched exposure group]: 241.2) and the 
proportion of treatment-naïve subjects (Pool 1: 48.4%; Pool 1 [matched exposure group]: 39.4%)(Table 
21). 
Furthermore, the majority of paediatric subjects were diagnosed with idiopathic PAH (75.0%), followed by 
CHD-associated PAH (16.7%). In adults, the respective proportions were lower for idiopathic PAH (Pool 1: 
58.7%; Pool 1 [matched exposure group]: 60.6%) and CHD-associated PAH (5.9% and 9.1%, 
respectively). PAH due to connective tissue disease was reported in 28.0% and 21.2% of adult subjects, 
respectively, but not in the paediatric population, which is consistent with major registries such as TOPP 
and REVEAL-CHILDREN (Barst et al. 2012, Berger et al. 2012). 
In the paediatric population, a WHO functional class of I or II was reported for the majority of subjects 
(WHO FC II: 75%) compared to the pooled adult subjects, where most subjects (~55%) had a less 
favourable WHO functional class of III or IV. 
In PATENT-CHILD, all 24 subjects were pre-treated: 62.5% with ERAs and 37.5% with ERAs + PCAs. In 
contrast, approximately half of the adult subjects in Pool 1 were treatment-naïve (48.4%), and 43.7% of 
subjects were pre-treated with ERAs. In Pool 1 (matched exposure group), approximately half of the 
subjects were pre-treated with ERAs (48.5%), and 39.4% were treatment-naïve.

Numbers analysed comparison 
The number of subjects valid for safety analysis was 24 in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group, 254 in 
Pool 1 and 33 in Pool 1 (matched exposure group). 
Outcomes and estimation comparison 
Administration of riociguat in a dosage of 1.0-2.5 mg TID in the adult PATENT-1 study resulted in a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6MWD as compared to placebo in 
subjects with symptomatic PAH. In addition, riociguat had statistically significant and clinically relevant 
superior effects over placebo on the predefined secondary efficacy variables PVR, NT-proBNP, WHO FC, 
TTCW, and Borg CR 10 Scale. The long-term 6MWD data from PATENT-2 indicated maintenance of the 
riociguat treatment effect, with clinically relevant improvement in 6MWD, observed for at least 18 
months. Improvements in NT-proBNP, WHO FC, Borg CR 10 Scale, and EQ-5D, as well as PVR, were 
consistent with favourable key findings seen in PATENT-1. 
A side-by-side comparison of the adult data to the PATENT-CHILD main phase results shows that the 
outcomes are generally consistent between adult and paediatric populations (Table 23 and Figure 19).

Figure 19. Box plot by visit - Distance covered after 6 minutes (m) (SAF) 
6MWD 
In Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group), the mean 6MWD at baseline was 361.4 m and 368.2 m, 
respectively, and between baseline and Week 24, an improvement in 6MWD was seen with a mean 
change of 53.1 m (mean relative change: 15.3%) and 59.5 m (17.3%), respectively. Considering pre-
treated adult subjects in Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group) only, the mean 6MWD at baseline 
was slightly lower, with 353.0 m and 352.5 m, respectively. Between baseline and Week 24, an 
improvement in 6MWD was seen with a mean change of 53.5 m (mean relative change: 15.8%) and 57.8 
m (18.3%), respectively. In the PATENT-CHILD study, the improvement in 6MWD at week 24 was 23.0 
m. 
Potential reasons for the observed lower magnitude of effect on 6MWD in the paediatric population may 
be related to i) higher mean 6MWD at baseline (442.1 m in PATENT-CHILD compared to 361.4 m and 
368.2 m in PATENT-1 [Pool 1 and Pool 1-matched exposure group, respectively]), ii) a higher proportion 
of patients with WHO functional class II at baseline (75% in PATENT-CHILD compared to 42.5% and 
45.5% in PATENT-1, respectively), and iii) a greater proportion of patients on background PAH 
medications at baseline (100% in PATENT-CHILD compared to 51.6% and 60.6% in PATENT-1, 
respectively). All these factors suggest the paediatric study population had a lower baseline risk for 
disease progression, which may have contributed to a lower potential for improvement and lower 
observed magnitude of effect on 6MWD with riociguat treatment. 
Results of the post-hoc subgroup analyses by a low and high risk for progression based on 6MWD at 
baseline in pre-treated subjects are presented below:  
• 
in the subgroup of subjects with a low-risk level (based on baseline 6MWD), similar 
mean 6MWD values at baseline and similar improvements of 6MWD at Week 24 were 
shown in the 3 groups (mean change of 23.2 m in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT

group) [n=4]),  
• 
in the subgroup of subjects with a high-risk level (based on baseline 6MWD), both the 
mean 6MWD at baseline and improvement of 6MWD at Week 24 were lower in the 
PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group (n=3) compared with the adult subjects in Pool 1 
(n=118) and Pool 1 (matched exposure group) (n=16) (mean change of 21.5 m vs 
57.4 m and 67.7 m, respectively). 
NT-proBNP 
In Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group), the mean NT-proBNP at baseline was 1020.5 pg/mL 
(median 389.5 pg/mL) and 387.3 pg/mL (241.2 pg/mL), respectively, and between baseline and Week 
24, an improvement in NT-proBNP was seen with a mean change of –337.1 pg/mL (median change –51.7 
pg/mL) and –17.3 pg/mL (–35.6 pg/mL), respectively. In Pool 1, the median ratio to baseline at Week 24 
was 0.71, and in Pool 1 (matched exposure group), it was 0.85. Similar mean change results were seen 
between baseline and last visit until Week 24 in Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group) compared to 
those between baseline and Week 24. Considering pre-treated adult subjects in Pool 1 and Pool 1 
(matched exposure group) only, the mean NT-proBNP at baseline was slightly lower, with 920.3 pg/mL 
and 367.2 pg/mL, respectively. Between baseline and Week 24, an improvement in NT-proBNP was seen 
with a mean change of –107.5 pg/mL and –37.9 pg/mL, translating in median ratios to baseline at Week 
24 of 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. In the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group, the mean NT-proBNP was 
982.7 pg/mL, and the median was 202.0 pg/mL. Between baseline and Week 24, NT-proBNP improved 
with a mean change of –65.8 pg/mL and a median change of –12.1 pg/mL. As a result, the median ratio 
to baseline at Week 24 was 0.88.  
Results of the post-hoc subgroup analyses by a low and high risk for progression based on 6MWD at 
baseline in pre-treated subjects are presented below:  
• 
in the subgroup of subjects with a low-risk level (based on baseline 6MWD), the 
median NT-proBNP at baseline was higher in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group 
(n=20) compared with the adult subjects in Pool 1 (n=13) and Pool 1 (matched 
exposure group) (n=4). The improvement in NT-proBNP (negative median change) 
from baseline at Week 24 in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group was lower 
compared with the adult subjects in Pool 1 and higher compared with the adult 
subjects in Pool 1 (matched exposure group) (-12.1 pg/ml vs -32.9 pg/ml and 38.2 
pg/ml, respectively), 
• 
in the subgroup of subjects with a high-risk level (based on baseline 6MWD), the 
median NT-proBNP at baseline and improvement in NT-proBNP (negative median 
change) from baseline at Week 24 were both higher in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat 
IDT group (n=3) compared with the adult subjects in Pool 1 (n=118) and Pool 1 
(matched exposure group) (n=16) (-435.0 pg/ml vs -8.5 pg/ml and -71.6 pg/ml, 
respectively).

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Riociguat tablets were approved in the EU in 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This 
application for Adempas (riociguat) is a Type II variation for adding an indication in paediatric patients 
aged 6 to less than 18 years with PAH.  
The application is based on the results of the completed paediatric development program in line with the 
approved EU PIP, EMEA-000718-PIP01-09-M06 (PIP decision number P/0289/2016) and with the 
completed full compliance check (EMA/PDCO/533423/2020). 
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the efficacy of riociguat for paediatric is 
based on the assumption that similar exposures and pharmacodynamic effects in children compared to 
adults will result in similar efficacy in children. In this context, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) modelling study (study 15463) has been conducted to predict the pharmacokinetic properties of 
riociguat in the paediatric population. The primary efficacy data obtained in the proposed target 
population, i.e. paediatric patients aged 6 -18 years old with PAH, is derived from the phase 3 open-label, 
individual dose titration study 15681 (PATENT-CHILD). The dosing regimens in the PATENT-CHILD were 
aimed at achieving systemic exposures in the range of that seen in adult PAH patients. Additionally, the 
MAH has conducted clinical comparisons in which paediatric data are displayed side-by-side with pooled 
data from the phase 3 studies in adults (PATENT-1/2).  
Extrapolation plan 
The extrapolation concept provided by the MAH is very sparse. According to the MAH several 
considerations justify the overall approach to extrapolate efficacy from adults, including the 
demonstration of the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the response to therapy, as 
well as the safety of use in all the relevant populations. Although these considerations are generally in 
line with the reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatrics 
(EMA/189724/2018) and the draft ICH E11A guideline, the interpretation differs, particularly concerning 
similar responses to therapy. 
Disease similarity 
Regarding disease similarity, it is acknowledged that the pathophysiology of PAH is similar among 
children enrolled in PATENT-CHILD (6 to <18 years) and adults. Historically, the definition of PH in 
children has been the same as in adults, i.e. mPAP ≥25 mmHg and PVR ≥ 240 dys s cm-5 ( 3 Wood units. 
However, the distribution of PAH aetiologies in children is slightly different from that in adults, with a 
larger proportion of PAH associated with CHD in children, whereas in both populations, the majority of 
patients have IPAH.  
Similar drug pharmacology. 
The MAH argued that the hemodynamic mechanism of action of riociguat as an sGC stimulator is 
responsible for PAH efficacy and is expected to be similar in adults and children. Although this can be 
acknowledged, this does not automatically mean that there is similar drug pharmacology, which also 
refers to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties besides the mechanism of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 68/103 
 
 
 
 
action. For example, the mean exposure obtained in the paediatric population in the PATENT-CHILD Study 
was clearly lower than in adult PAH patients, i.e. towards the 25th percentile for all comparison groups. 
Furthermore, it was shown that for a major part of the paediatric subjects (9/24) dosed in the PATENT-
CHILD Study 15681, clearance was higher than predicted from the PBPK model. This lower exposure in 
paediatric patients is only partially explained by the lower dose-equivalents for children in the 
maintenance phase of PATENT-CHILD than for the adult population and the presence of increased 
riociguat clearance in a part of the paediatric population. Nevertheless, the observed, and as yet 
unexplained, reduced exposure in the paediatric population as compared to adults does not appear to 
result in reduced efficacy when comparing the efficacy (6-minute walking distance) of the paediatric 
patients with that in adults and with the other paediatric patients. These findings are consistent with the 
corresponding PK/PD profiles in adult subjects with PAH, i.e. no clear relationship between changes in 
6MWD and riociguat trough concentrations. 
Similar exposure response  
Similar exposure-response between the adult and paediatric population has not been demonstrated. In 
adult PH patients, there is a close and direct relationship between riociguat plasma concentrations and 
haemodynamic effects such as decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR), decrease in systolic blood pressure (SB) and increase in cardiac output (CO) after 
administration of a wide range of single doses (0.5 – 5 mg) or at steady state (1.0 – 2.5 mg TID). 
However, such a relationship between plasma concentrations and haemodynamic effects has not been 
demonstrated for the paediatric population since right heart catheterization (RHC) to assess such 
haemodynamic parameters was not performed in the paediatric subjects in the PATENT-CHILD study. 
Therefore, PK/PD relationships were investigated for 6MWD and NT-proBNP, a diagnostic biomarker for 
the presence of heart failure. However, no PK/PD relationship between riociguat exposure and 6MWD or 
NT-proBNP were observed in the adult and the paediatric population. The MAH  argued that overall the 
PK/PD profiles for 6MWD and NT-proBNP in paediatric subjects are consistent with the corresponding 
PK/PD profiles observed in adult subjects and that the PK/PD relationships are considered similar. 
Nevertheless, in the PATENT-CHILD trial, there was a positive trend in improvement in exercise capacity 
(mean change of 23.01 m at week 24; see also below). Responder analyses showed that 9 of 19 subjects 
in PATIENT-CHILD (47.4%; 3 subjects ≥ 6 to 12 years and 6 subjects ≥12 to < 18 years) had an 
improvement by at least 20 m at week 24. To note, an improvement of 20 m is considered clinically 
relevant in adults. Therefore, the favourable trend can be considered of clinical relevance. Furthermore, 
differences in PK/PD responses between adults and paediatric subjects are not anticipated. Overall, the 
extrapolation of data is acceptable given the favourable trend in 6MWD in the direction of the adult 
population and the similar safety profiles between adults and the paediatric population. 
Design and conduct of clinical study (PATENT-CHILD; study 15681) 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate to reflect paediatric patients with PAH. Key inclusion 
included paediatric subjects aged 6-18 years diagnosed with PAH (idiopathic PAH (IPAH), hereditable PAH 
(HPAH), PAH associated with connective tissue disease, or PAH associated with congenital heart disease), 
evidenced by a mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg, PAWP ≤15 mm Hg, and a PVR ≥ 240 dyn s cm-5 (3 Wood units) via 
RHC, and WHO FC I-III. Furthermore, eligible paediatric subjects had to be on the guideline-
recommended standard of care PAH medication, i.e. endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and/or 
prostacyclin analogues (PCA), for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline visit. The key exclusion criterion of 
concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors and non-specific PDE5 inhibitors (theophylline, dipyridamole), nitrates 
or NO donors is in line with the current contra-indications for riociguat based on adult data and, therefore 
appropriate. Furthermore, subjects were ineligible if they had an active state of hemoptysis or pulmonary

haemorrhage within 3 months prior to screening or systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 5 mmHg 
lower than the age-, sex- and height-adapted level of the 50th SBP percentile. 
The study design of PATENT-CHILD is appropriate to achieve the primary and secondary objectives of the 
study. The study consisted of two parts: 1) the main study part, which consisted of two phases, i.e. 
titration phase of up to 8 weeks and a maintenance phase of up to 16 weeks, and 2) a long-term 
extension (LTE) part until market approval or riociguat for the paediatric population or until a subject 
turns 18 years of age. All subjects received a body-weight-adjusted dose of riociguat to achieve a similar 
exposure as that observed in adults treated for PAH using the approved IR tablets (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 mg) 
for children with bodyweight ≥ 50kg or the new granules-for-oral-suspension (0.15 mg/mL) for children 
with bodyweight < 50 kg. The starting dose was the body weight-adjusted equivalent of the 1.0 mg dose 
in adults, and the dose could be up-titrated with 2 weeks intervals to a maximum of 2.5 mg equivalent 
TID based on systolic blood pressure and whether the participant showed signs of hypotension. Down-
titration was permitted at all times for safety reasons. A follow-up period of 60 days (±8) after the last 
treatment dose can be considered appropriate for information on the safety of riociguat off-treatment. 
The efficacy assessment was not the primary goal of this clinical study, but safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics. The efficacy variables were evaluated as secondary endpoints of the main study part in 
an exploratory manner. Therefore, the study has only limited informative value regarding efficacy. 
Efficacy variables included change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 24) in 6MWD, WHO FC, NT-
proBNP, quality of life (QoL) scores and time to clinical worsening (TTCW), which are in line with the 
paediatric addendum to the CHMP guideline (EMA 2012) and therefore acceptable. It is acknowledged 
that it is not feasible to perform statistically powered clinical studies for efficacy in children with PAH, as 
is done for adults since PAH is a rare disease in adults and has an even lower incidence in children. 
According to the guideline on the clinical investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (EMA/CHMP/213972/2010), for medicinal products where the benefit-risk 
profile is known in adult PAH, “an extensive paediatric development is not foreseen as their efficacy and 
safety are already established in adult PAH. The main remaining issues in paediatric clinical development 
is defining the therapeutic dose, and short and long-term safety. Considering their mechanism of action, 
the primary endpoint for the dose-finding study should be haemodynamic parameters measured at 12 
weeks”. According to the same guideline, invasive measurements are the only acceptable haemodynamic 
endpoints. In the PATENT-CHILD study, right heart catheterization (RCH) to assess and follow-up 
hemodynamic parameters were not indicated in the clinical study protocol as RHC is not recommended in 
paediatric studies due to the high rate of serious complications (Olliver et al. 2019). The role of non-
invasive techniques such as echocardiography is less clear at present; nevertheless, such measurements 
are encouraged to complement understanding of the disease course and any treatment activity according 
to the guideline. In the paediatric study, echocardiographic parameters is included as the efficacy 
variable, which is considered appropriate. Nevertheless, the echocardiographic evaluations were sparse 
(see below). 
The sample size was determined based on an accurate PK evaluation and the feasibility of the study in a 
reasonable time frame. Efficacy outcomes were evaluated in an exploratory manner. No statistical 
analyses were performed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The dosing regimens for both tablet and granules for oral suspension formulations were aimed at 
achieving systemic exposures in the range of that seen in adult PAH patients. Although, however, no 
indication is sought for patients < 50 kg treated with the granules for oral suspension formulation, data 
on experience with the granules-for-oral-suspension is considered supportive for review of experience 
with tablets and therefore included in the overall results, which is considered acceptable.

Twenty-four subjects (6 subjects in the ≥6 to <12 years old cohort and 18 subjects in the ≥12 to <18 
years cohort) entered the study, of which 21 subjects (87.5%) completed the 24-week main treatment 
period and entered the LTE period. Three patients discontinued the main treatment period due to adverse 
events. At the cut-off date of 7 Jan 2022, 8 of the 21 subjects (33.3%) were still in the LTE part of the 
study. Of the total of 13 subjects who terminated the LTE part of the study, 5 subjects stopped as they 
reached the age of 18 years, and 8 subjects did not complete the LTE period with adverse events (n=3) 
and physician decision (n=3) as the most common reason. 
Regarding formulations, 16 paediatric subjects started the study on suspension and 8 paediatric subjects 
started on riociguat tablets. Of the 16 on suspension, 6 switched to tablets at 24 weeks or later. 
Furthermore, at the end of the titration phase, the majority (16/22; 72.7%) were on the highest riociguat 
dose of 2.5 mg or the body-weight equivalent. 
The proportion of subjects with important protocol deviations was relatively high (37.5% (n=9), however, 
these deviations were not considered to have an important effect on the outcome of the study since most 
of the deviations concerned written informed consent was signed after the study specific procedure (in/ex 
criteria not met) or omission of pregnancy testing (procedure deviations). 
This study was a multicentre study (n=19) conducted worldwide, and half of the subjects were from 
Europe. 
Regarding baseline data, the majority of the patients (n=18/24) were in the older ≥ 12 to < 18 years 
cohort, with the remainder (6/24) in the younger ≥6 to <12 years cohort (mean age: 12.8 years). In the 
younger cohort, all subjects had a body weight (BW) < 50 kg, whereas in the older cohort, 10 subjects 
had a BW ≥ 50 kg and 8 subjects a BW <50 kg. The aetiologies of PAH were idiopathic (n=18, 75.0%), 
PAH associated to congenital heart disease (repaired) (n=4, 16.7%), heritable (n=1, 4.2%), and 
pulmonary hypertension associated with developmental abnormalities (n=1, 4.2%). Only patients 
receiving stable doses of ERA (n=15, 62.5%) or ERA + PCA (n=9, 37.5%) were enrolled and continued 
their PAH treatment during the study. Furthermore, at baseline, the majority of patients were WHO 
functional class (FC) II (n=18, 75%); one patient (4.2%) was WHO FC I, and five patients (20.8%) were 
WHO FC III. 
The PATENT-CHILD study showed favourable trends in the exploratory endpoints. Treatment with 
riociguat improved 6MWD with a mean change of 23.01 m at Week 24. An improvement in 6MWD was 
observed in both age cohorts, although the increase was larger in the younger age cohort compared with 
the older age cohort (46.40 m vs 14.66 m). Furthermore, an improvement in 6MWD was observed in the 
subgroup of subjects receiving ERA+PCA as concomitant PAH medications (62.31 m) but not in those 
receiving ERA only (-5.56 m). During the LTE part of the study, inconsistent results in 6MWD were 
observed with a change of 5.86 m (SD 44.56; n=16) at Month 6, -3.43 m (SD 74.77, n=12) at Month 12; 
28.98 m (SD 66.71, n=9) at Month 18, and – 11.80 m (SD 35.40, n=4) at Month 24. However, the 
results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited number of subjects and the high standard 
deviations. Responder analyses showed that 9 of 19 subjects in PATIENT-CHILD (47.4%; 3 subjects ≥ 6 
to 12 years and 6 subjects ≥12 to < 18 years) had an improvement by at least  20 m at week 24 despite 
that all subjects were already on concomitant PAH medication. Even after one year of treatment still 
about half of the paediatric subjects had an improvement by ≥20 m. To note, an improvement of 20 m is 
considered clinically relevant in adults. Therefore, the favourable trend can be considered of clinical 
relevance. 
Regarding NT-proBNP, an improvement with a mean change of –65.77 pg/mL and a median change of –
12.05 pg/mL was observed between baseline and Week 24. An improvement in a median change in NT-
proBNP was observed in the younger age cohort and the subgroup of subjects receiving ERA+ PCA but 
not in the older age group nor in the subgroup of ERA only. During the LTE part of the study, the mean 
changes from baseline for NT-proBNP -291.05 pg/mL (median 0.00; n=11) at Month 6, -222.78 pg/mL 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 71/103 
 
 
 
 
(median -5.50, n=12) at Month 12; -283.40 pg/mL (median -8.00, n=9) at Month 18, and -270.93 
pg/mL (median -243.00, n=4) at Month 24. Similar to 6MWD, the results should be interpreted with 
caution due to the limited number of subjects and the high standard deviations, which resulted in 
different trends in terms of means and medians. Nevertheless, responder analyses showed that 57.1% of 
the paediatric subjects had an improvement in NT-proBNP at week 24, which is considered clinically 
relevant although there was a high variety in effect size. These improvements were maintained up to 24 
months. 
Paediatric patients treated with riociguat showed no improvement in WHO FC, i.e. no subjects reported a 
change in WHO functional class between baseline and Week 24. Furthermore, there were 2 subjects with 
a TTCW event of hospitalization for right heart failure (both in the ≥12 to <18 years cohort). Between 
LTE start and data cut-off date, an additional 6 subjects of the older age cohort were reported with 
clinical worsening, including 3 events of hospitalization for right heart failure, 2 events of lung 
transplantation and 2 events of increase in WHO FC from baseline. Regarding quality of life (QoL), for SF-
10 physical and psychosocial summary scores, an improvement with a mean change of 5.79 and 1.10 
was observed at Week 24, respectively. For PedsQL total scale score, an improvement with a mean 
change of 3.49 was observed at Week 24. An improvement was also seen in the PedsQL physical health 
summary score (mean change of 4.28) and PedsQL psychosocial health summary score (mean change of 
3.07) at Week 24.  
Although trends of improvement were seen in single echocardiographic parameters such as right 
ventricular cardiac output (RV-CO; 16 participants), the PK/PD analysis revealed no significant correlation 
between change in echocardiographic parameters and riociguat exposure due to the limited number of 
subjects with echocardiographic measurements and the high standard deviation. 
Comparison and integrated analyses of paediatric and adult data 
The MAH has performed a side-by-side clinical comparison of the paediatric exploratory efficacy data from 
the main study part (first 24 weeks of treatment) in PATENT-CHILD with pooled data from the Phase 3 
studies in adults (PATENT-1 and PATENT-2), within the first 24 weeks of treatment in order further to 
support the favourable efficacy results of the PATENT-CHILD study. Furthermore, as the study duration of 
PATENT-1 (12 weeks) was shorter than the duration of the main study part of PATENT-CHILD (24 weeks), 
data from subsequent treatment weeks from the open-label LTE study PATENT-2 were also taken into 
account up to a total of 24 weeks (referred to as “Pool 1” hereafter). Additionally, a “matched exposure” 
group from the PATENT-1/2 was selected, which showed individual PK exposure (AUC(0 8h)ss) similar to 
the observed individuals’ PK exposure (AUC(0-8h)ss) in paediatric subjects regardless of their background 
therapy ((referred to as “Pool 1 [matched exposure group]” hereafter).  
Regarding study participants, the adult and paediatric populations are generally comparable, with some 
differences. For example, PATENT-1 (and PATENT-2) included patients with symptomatic PAH and WHO 
FC II-III, either treatment-naïve or pre-treated with an ERA or a PCA, whereas the PATENT-CHILD study 
included patients with WHO FC I-III on the standard of care (including ERA+PCA or ERA only). The types 
of PAH in the children studied in PATENT-CHILD were consistent with those included in PATENT-1, namely 
IPAH, HPAH, and PAH associated to CHD repaired types. However, the majority of paediatric subjects 
were diagnosed with idiopathic PAH (75.0%), followed by CHD-associated PAH (16.7%), whereas in 
adults, the respective proportions were lower for idiopathic PAH (Pool 1: 58.7%; Pool 1 [matched 
exposure group]: 60.6%) and CHD-associated PAH (5.9% and 9.1%, respectively). PAH due to 
connective tissue disease was reported in 28.0% and 21.2% of adult subjects, respectively, but not in the 
paediatric population.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 72/103 
 
 
 
 
In Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group), the improvement in mean 6MWD was 53.1 m and 59.5 
m, respectively, while the improvement in mean 6MWD in the paediatric population was 23.0 m. The MAH 
argued that the lower effect size could be explained by the lower baseline risk in the paediatric patients 
because the paediatric patients had 1) a higher mean 6MWD at baseline (442.1 m in PATENT-CHILD 
compared to 361.4 m and 368.2 m in PATENT-1 [Pool 1 and Pool 1-matched exposure group, 
respectively]), 2) a higher proportion of patients with WHO functional class II at baseline (75% vs 42.5% 
and 45.5%, respectively), and 3) a greater proportion of patients on background PAH medications at 
baseline (100% vs to 51.6% and 60.6%, respectively). The latter argument does not hold since subgroup 
analyses of pre-treated adult subjects in Pool 1 and Pool 1 (matched exposure group) showed an 
approximately similar improvement in mean 6MWD of 53.5 m and 57.8 m, respectively. To further 
confirm that differences in baseline risk can explain the difference, the MAH conducted post-hoc subgroup 
analyses by low and high risk for progression based on 6MWD at baseline in pre-treated subjects. In the 
subgroup with a low risk level similar improvements of 6MWD at week 24 were observed (mean change 
of 23.2 m in the PATENT-CHILD riociguat IDT group (n=20) compared with 19.8 m in the Pool 1 (n=13) 
and 20.8 m Pool 1 (matched exposure group) (n=4), whereas in the subgroup of subjects with a high risk 
level the improvement of 6MWD in the paediatric population was lower compared with the adult 
population (mean change of 21.5 m (n=3) vs 57.4 m (n=118) and 67.7 m (n=16), respectively). 
Although the explanation can be followed, firm conclusions can not be made due to the limited sample 
size and the high variability (SD).  
Regarding NT-proBNP, similar as observed with 6MWD, the median NT-proBNP at baseline was lower and 
the improvement in NT-proBNP at week 24 was lower in the paediatric group compared with Pool 1 and 
Pool 1 (matched exposure group) (median change of -12.1 pg/ml vs -51.7 pg/ml and -35.6 pg/ml, 
respectively). In addition, post-hoc subgroup analyses by a low and high risk for progression based on 
6MWD showed inconsistent results in terms of NT-proBNP. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the 
standard deviations are very large and that the trends in mean and median are not comparable. Also, the 
comparisons in terms of WHO FC and TTCW are difficult to interpret due to the limited sample size.  
Overall, the efficacy variables of PATENT-CHILD show a favourable trend in the direction of PATENT-1/-2. 
However, firm conclusions on a similar effect size in terms of 6MWD and NT-proBNP improvement 
achieved with a comparable riociguat exposure between the paediatric PAH population and the adult PAH 
population are difficult to made due to the limited sample size in the paediatric population, the fact that 
the paediatric patients appears at lower risk for progression at baseline and the high variability (SD) in 
efficacy outcomes. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although the efficacy outcomes of PATENT-CHILD show favourable trends which are consistent with the 
effects observed in the adult PATENT-1/-2 studies, these efficacy variables were only evaluated in an 
exploratory manner. As such, the MAH has included an extrapolation concept based on the principles of 
the EMA reflection paper on extrapolation (EMA 2018) and in the current draft ICH E11A guideline on 
paediatric extrapolation (EMA 2022). Although similar PK/PD relationships between the adult and 
paediatric population could not be demonstrated, given the favourable trend in 6MWD in the direction of 
the adult population and the similar safety profiles between adults and the paediatric population, 
extrapolation of data is considered valid.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
For the evaluation of safety, paediatric safety data from the main treatment phase (24 weeks of 
treatment) in the pivotal PATENT-CHILD study provides the most relevant data source for the use of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

riociguat in children with PAH. The safety analysis set (SAF) included all randomized children who 
received at least one dose of study medication. 
In Study 15681, all 24 children were included in the SAF. In addition, descriptive analyses of the PATENT-
CHILD LTE phase based on the interim release date of the clinical database (cut-off date 07 JAN 2022) 
are provided. No integrated analysis of long-term safety data was performed. 
The primary safety outcome of this pivotal study was the incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs as well as 
discontinuations from the study. Furthermore, the change from baseline to Week 24 in heart rate, blood 
pressure, x-ray of the left hand, and laboratory parameters were also assessed. 
Patient exposure 
In total, the mean (SD) treatment duration was 22.01 (6.44) weeks and the median duration was 24 
weeks, ranging from 0.9 to 25.1 weeks (Table 24). The mean duration of treatment was higher in the ≥
12 to <18 subgroups (22.63 weeks), as compared with the ≥6 to <12 group (20.14 weeks). Similarly, 
higher mean duration of treatment was observed in the ERA+PCA concomitant PAH medication subgroup 
(23.30 weeks) compared to the ERA only (21.24 weeks) subgroup. 
Regarding cumulative treatment exposure, more than 90% of subjects received treatment for at least 16 
weeks, corresponding to Visit 7. Treatment duration of at least 20 weeks was reported for about 87.5% of 
subjects. No notable differences were observed regarding treatment across age and concomitant PAH 
medication subgroups

LTE phase 
At the cut-off date of the LTE phase of PATENT-CHILD, the mean (SD) treatment duration was 109.79 
(80.38) weeks, and the median duration was 114.64 weeks, ranging from 0.9 to 311.9 weeks. The 
median treatment duration was comparable between age groups, whereas it was considerably shorter in 
the subgroups of subjects pretreated with ERA and PCA compared with those pretreated with ERA only 
(54.29 vs 127.71 weeks). 
Exposure to study drug 
At the end of the 8-week titration phase (Visit 5), 16 (72.7%) subjects were on the highest riociguat dose 
of 2.5 mg or the body-weight equivalent, 1 (4.5%) subject each was on 2.0 mg, on 1.5 mg, and on 1.0 
mg, and 3 (13.6%) subjects were on 0.5 mg or the respective body-weight equivalent.

General frequency of adverse events 
During the main phase of Study 15681, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 
20/24 (83.3%) subjects, mostly of mild or moderate intensity (Table 25). The overall frequency of TEAEs 
ranged from 42.1% to 70.6% across the different equivalent doses. Overall, most of the TEAEs had 
outcomes reported as recovered/resolved (54.2%). TEAEs were reported as recovering/resolving, 
recovering/resolving with sequelae in 8.3% of subjects each, and not recovered/resolved in 12.5% of 
subjects. 
TEAEs related to the study drug occurred in 7/24 (29.2%) subjects. The majority of them were mild and 
moderate intensity, with 1(4.2%) subject, in the riociguat group 1.0 mg dose group experiencing severe 
drug-related TEAE. The percentage of a subject with serious adverse events (SAEs) and TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment was 16.7% and 12.5%, respectively. TEAEs of special interest were 
reported for 4 (16.7%) of subjects. No deaths occurred in the study.  
Table 24. Summary of number (%) of subjects with TEAEs by equivalent dose (safety analysis set) 
Common TEAEs 
The most frequently reported TEAEs during the main treatment period by primary SOCs were infections 
and infestations (58.3%), nervous system disorders (33.3%), and general disorders and administration

site conditions (25%) (Table 26). The most frequently reported primary PTs were headache (29.2%), 
abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (16.7% each). 
The most common TEAEs in total by preferred term were headache (29.2% of subjects), abdominal pain, 
nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (16.7% each). The preferred term frequencies and 
the ranking of the most frequently preferred terms were generally comparable across equivalent 
treatment doses.

Treatment related TEAEs 
At least one study drug-related TEAEs during the main treatment period occurred in 7/24 (29.2%) of 
subjects. The most common drug-related TEAEs in total by the preferred term was hypotension, reported 
for 3 subjects (12.5%). All other preferred terms (ie, “blood pressure systolic decreased”, “diastolic 
hypotension”, “headache”, “presyncope”, and “right ventricular failure”) were reported for 1 subject 
(4.2%), each. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The most common adverse reaction related to riociguat reported in PATENT-CHILD during the first 24 
weeks was hypotension (3/24 subjects [12.5%]). All other events (i.e., “blood pressure systolic 
decreased”, “diastolic hypotension” , “headache”, “insomnia”, “presyncope”, and “right ventricular 
failure”) were reported by 1 subject (4.2%), each. 
During the LTE phase, the events “vomiting”, “pulmonary arterial hypertension” and “headache” were 
reported in one subject each.  
Adverse drug reactions and events assessed as related to riociguat and reported in more than one subject 
were considered for inclusion in the ADR section of the label using the same Medical Term Groupings as 
for the initial submission. With the cut-off date 07 JAN 2022, there were 4/24 subjects reported with 
hypotension and 2/24 subjects reported with a headache were applied as done in the initial submission. 
With the cut-off date 07 JAN 2022, there were 4/24 subjects reported with hypotension and 2/24 subjects 
reported with a headache. 
These safety data did not show an increase in ADR incidence and did not identify any new ADR. 
LTE phase 
As expected for a longer reporting period (median treatment duration 114.64 weeks [0.9 – 311.9]), 
higher frequencies of AEs were reported when including the optional LTE phase (95.8%) compared to the 
main phase (83.3%) of PATENT-CHILD. The most frequently reported TEAEs until the LTE cut-off by 
primary SOC were consistent with the main phase and there was no dose-related pattern of AEs. Of note, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 79/103 
 
 
 
 
 
the majority of drug-related TEAEs were already reported during the main phase. No deaths were 
reported in the LTE phase up to the cut-off date of 07 JAN 2022. 
Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs were reported for 4 (16.7%) subjects in total (Table 27). The most common serious 
TEAEs in total by preferred term were a right ventricular failure (reported for 2 [8.3%] subjects), asthma, 
the pain of skin, skin swelling, and hypotension (reported for 1 [4.2%] subject, each). 
Drug-related serious TEAEs were reported for 2 (8.3%) subjects. The only two drug-related serious TEAEs 
reported were right ventricular failure and hypotension, reported for 1 (4.2%) subject each.

set) 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in the study. 
AEs of special interest 
Overall, 4 (16.7%) subjects reported treatment-emergent AESI (Table 28). All treatment-emergent AESI 
were of moderate intensity and were all reported with an outcome as “recovered/resolved”. Treatment-
emergent AESI of “hypotension” was reported for 3 (12.5%) subjects. “Hemoptosis” was reported for 1

(4.2%) subject. No bone and/or growth anomalies were reported during the main treatment period of the 
study. 
Discontinuation of study medication due to treatment-emergent AESIs was reported for 2 cases (1 case 
each of “symptomatic hypotension” and “hypotension”). A decrease in study medication dose was 
reported for one subject due to a treatment-emergent AESI of hypotension. No change of dose and/or 
discontinuation of study medication due to treatment-emergent AESIs was recorded for the other 2 
subjects reporting hypotension and hemoptosis.

Bone age and bone morphology 
At baseline, bone age considered by the specialist as “in accordance” with chronological age was reported 
for the majority (11 [52.4%]) of the subjects, followed by “advanced”, reported for 9 (42.9%) subjects. 
Only in 1 (4.8%) subject was the bone age considered “delayed” compared to the chronological age. 
At Week 24, bone age considered by the specialist “advanced”, as compared to the chronological age, 
was reported for the majority (11 [52.4%]) of the subjects, followed by “in accordance”, reported for 6 
(28.6%) subjects, “delayed” reported for 3 (14.3%]) subjects, and “missing” reported for 1 (4.8%) 
subject. For this last subject, the reviewer specialist assessed the x-ray of the left hand as “not 
evaluable”.  
At baseline, bone morphology considered by the specialist as “normal”, as compared to the chronological 
age, was reported for almost all (20 [95.2%]) subjects. Only for 1 (4.8%) subject, the bone morphology 
was reported as “missing” . For this last subject, the x-ray of left hand was assessed as “not evaluable” 
by the reviewer specialist. For none of the subjects, “abnormal” bone morphology was reported. 
At Week 24, no changes in the analysis of bone morphology, as compared to baseline, were observed. 
Until the LTE cut-off up to Month 54, bone age was reported for individual subjects only and assessed as 
either “in accordance” or “advanced” regarding chronological age. Bone morphology was reported for 
individual subjects only and always assessed as “normal”.

In addition to the evaluation of x-rays, an overall assessment including height, weight and pubertal 
development using the Tanner scale was performed. These were reviewed on an ongoing basis by the 
DMC 
No bone and/or growth anomalies were reported during the main treatment phase of the study. 
Laboratory findings/vital signs 
The mean and median changes in laboratory safety parameters between baseline and subsequent study 
visits were small and comparable across age and concomitant PAH medication subgroups. No clinically 
significant abnormalities of laboratory parameters were reported as adverse events. No clinically 
meaningful changes in SBP, DBP, heart rate, weight, or ECG parameters were identified.  
Hematology 
Treatment-emergent high values occurring in ≥15% of subjects were observed for hematocrit (17.4%), 
erythrocytes and monocytes (16.7%, each), and eosinophils (15.8%). Treatment-emergent low values 
occurring in ≥15% of subjects were observed for lymphocytes (16.7%). 
Clinical chemistry 
Treatment-emergent low and high values for any clinical chemistry parameters were reported for very 
few subjects (less than 15%). 
Blood pressure 
At baseline, the mean SBP was 112.9 mmHg (SD 10.9) and was higher in the subgroup of subjects of ≥12 
to <18 years (115.3 mmHg, SD 10.9) compared with those of ≥6 to <12 years (105.5 mmHg, SD 6.9). 
The mean change from baseline in SBP at Week 24 was –3.1 mmHg. While this decrease was pronounced 
in the ≥12 to <18 years subgroup (mean change: –6.2 mmHg at Week 24), an SBP increase was 
observed in the ≥6 to <12 years subgroup (mean change: 6.6 mmHg at Week 24). Decreases ranged 
from -9.3 to -2.1 in the ≥12 to <18 years subgroup. For this subgroup, the decrease in mean change from 
baseline for SBP was most pronounced at the 2-hour post-dose time point (-9.3 mmHg). Mean changes 
from baseline ranged from -1.0 to +6.6 in the ≥6 to <12 years subgroup. The mean change from a 
baseline of -1.0 occurred at the 2-hour post-dose time point. 
Although a decrease was observed in the mean change from baseline in SBP in the ≥12 to <18 years 
subgroup, the mean SBP in this age group did not fall below 95 mmHg at any time point during the 
titration or maintenance phase. This is also the case for the ≥6 to <12 years subgroup, where mean SBP 
values were above 90 mmHg during the titration and maintenance phase. However, due to the small 
number of subjects in the 2 age subgroups, the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Heart rate 
In the total group, the overall mean baseline values for heart rate was 84.5 beats/minute (BPM). Higher 
baseline values were observed in the age ≥6 to <12 years subgroup (mean value: 91.7 BPM), compared 
to the ≥12 to <18 years subgroup (mean value: 82.2 BPM), which was consistent with the fact that heart 
rate decreases with age. 
For heart rate, the overall mean increase from baseline to Week 24 was +4.1 BPM. Mean change from 
baseline ranged from -4.0 (at 4 hour post-dose) to +6.5 (Week 20). No notable differences were found 
between the age subgroups.

Safety in special populations 
A summary of subjects with TEAEs stratified by age (≥6 to <12 years and ≥12 to <18 years) is shown for 
the paediatric population in PATENT-CHILD (Table 29). The small sample size of the 2 paediatric 
subgroups limits meaningful conclusions; therefore, the following results need to be interpreted with 
caution. 
Overall, the safety profile of riociguat was generally comparable across the 2 age subgroups, with similar 
incidences of TEAEs, serious TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study medication.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study medication were reported for 3 (12.5%) subjects. The only two 
TEAEs reported were a right ventricular failure (1 [4.2%] subject) and hypotension (2 [8.3%] subjects). 
Comparison and integrated analyses of paediatric and adult data 
Paediatric data are displayed side-by-side with data from the pooled groups (Pool 1 and Pool 2, as 
described below) from the adult Phase 3 studies for the indications of PAH (PATENT-1) and CTEPH 
(CHEST-1), together with the LTE PATENT-2 and CHEST-2 studies, within the first 24 weeks of treatment, 
to allow clinical comparison. Adult data are considered supportive for the evaluation of paediatric safety 
data.

As the study duration of the main study part of PATENT-CHILD (24 weeks) was longer than the duration 
of the PATENT-1 (12 weeks) and CHEST-1 (16 weeks), data from subsequent initial treatment weeks 
from the LTE study PATENT-2 and CHEST-2 were also taken into account up to a total of 24 weeks of 
observation in order to have a similar observation period of 24 weeks for the paediatric and adult 
population. Therefore, no statistical comparisons or conclusions were performed. 
The following treatment labels were used in the side-by-side presentation of the adult data with the 
paediatric data:

PATENT/CHEST-1/2 (IDT, CD) (referred to as “Pool 2” hereafter) 
General frequency of adverse events comparisons 
In PATENT-CHILD, there was no dose-related pattern of AEs and any numerical differences seen between 
the different equivalent doses were not regarded as clinically relevant.  
In the total paediatric population, the percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs (83.3%) was 
numerically lower than those in the adult pooled groups (ranging 94.7% to 94.9%)(Table 30). Similarly, 
the percentage of subjects experiencing drug-related TEAEs (29.2%) was lower than those in the adult 
pooled groups (ranging 68.4% to 72%). The percentage of subjects experiencing TESAEs (16.7%) was 
rather comparable to the incidences of TESAEs in the adult pooled groups (ranging 19.3% to 22%).

Common TEAEs comparisons 
In PATENT-CHILD, 83.3% of subjects had TEAEs during the main treatment phase. Most frequently 
reported primary SOCs were infections and infestations (58.3%), nervous system disorders (33.3%), and 
general disorders and administration site conditions (25%)(Table 31). These incidences were generally 
lower or comparable with those observed in the adult pooled groups, with the exception of the SOC 
“infections and infestations”, that was reported by a higher percentage of subjects in the paediatric 
population (58.3%) as compared to the adult pooled groups (ranging 47.6% to 48.4%). 
In PATENT-CHILD, the most frequently reported primary PTs were headache (29.2%), abdominal pain, 
nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (16.7% each). Most incidences on the PT level were 
lower or comparable with those observed in the adult pooled groups, with the exception of the PT 
“abdominal pain” and “upper respiratory tract infection”, which was reported by a higher percentage of 
subjects in the paediatric population (16.7%) as compared to the adult pooled groups (upper respiratory 
tract infection: ranging 6.7% to 7.1%; abdominal pain: 3.5% to 4.3%).

Serious adverse events 
In PATENT-CHILD, at least one TESAE was reported in 4/24 (16.7%) subjects after 24 weeks of 
treatment with riociguat. This rate was generally comparable with those observed across the adult pooled 
groups (ranging 19.3 to 22%).  
The most frequently reported primary SOC for TESAEs in the paediatric population was cardiac disorders 
(in 2/24 [8.3%] subjects; (preferred term: right ventricular failure) except for the SOC “cardiac 
disorders”, which was reported by a slightly higher percentage of subjects in the paediatric population 
(8.3%) as compared to the adult pooled groups (ranging 3.1% to 4.9%), incidences were generally 
comparable with those observed in the adult pooled groups.  
In PATENT-CHILD, after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat, 2 (8.3%) subjects reported one study of 
drug-related TESAE. One subject reported cardiac disorder (MedDRA SOC, PT: right ventricular failure), 
and 1 subject reported vascular disorders (MedDRA SOC, PT: hypotension). 
Deaths 
In PATENT-CHILD, no deaths were reported in the main and the LTE phase up to the cut-off date of 07 
JAN 2022. 
Across the pooled adult groups, after 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat, a low incidence of TEAEs with 
a fatal outcome (ranging 0.8% to 1.2%) was reported. Of the total number of deaths (N=6) reported, 
none were considered by the investigator to be study drug-related. 
AEs of special interest  
A total of 5 (20.8%) subjects reported treatment-emergent AESI in PATENT-CHILD (Table 32). 
Treatment-emergent AESI of “hypotension” was reported for 4 (16.7%) subjects.  Of the 5 subjects in 
total who reported an event of hypotension, 2 experienced hypotension during the first dose titration step 
and were discontinued from the study. Of note, one of the 2 subjects reported echocardiography results 
which were indicative of progression of underlying disease and which confound the case. Of the remaining 
3 subjects, one experienced hypotension during the titration phase. In conclusion, there are 2 
unconfounded cases where hypotension occurred during titration, one during the first dose step (1.0 mg) 
and the second during the last dose step (2.5 mg). The totality of these cases (and cases overall) do not 
demonstrate that a higher dose leads to higher exposure which results in a clinically significant decrease 
of blood pressure. 
“Hemoptysis” was reported for 1 (4.2%) subject. All treatment-emergent AESI were of moderate 
intensity and were all reported with an outcome as “recovered/resolved”.

Across the pooled adult groups, a similar incidence of treatment-emergent AESIs (ranging 15.7% to 
17.3%) was observed. Overall, “hypotension” was reported for 15 % subjects in the Pool 1 and 13.5% of 
subjects in Pool 2. “Hemoptysis” was reported for 2.8% subject in Pool 1 and 2.4 % of subjects in Pool 2

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Riociguat was well-tolerated in the paediatric population, with few (3 [12.5%]) subjects experiencing AEs 
that led to study drug discontinuation during the main phase of PATENT-CHILD. The reported SOCs were 
“vascular disorder” (preferred term: hypotension), reported for 2 (8.3%) subjects, and “cardiac 
disorders” (preferred term: right ventricular failure), reported for 1 (4.2%) subject. The most frequently 
reported TEAE resulting in discontinuation of the study drug (including the LTE phase) by primary SOC 
was vascular disorders (8.3%). The most frequently reported primary PT was hypotension (8.3%). 
All TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were considered study drug-related by the investigator.  
Across the pooled adult groups, a lower incidence of TEAEs (per SOC) leading to study drug 
discontinuation (ranging 5.3% to 7.5%) was observed, as compared to the paediatric population

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety relies primarily on the extrapolation of the adult safety profile. Paediatric safety 
data from the main treatment phase (24 weeks of treatment, n=24) in the pivotal PATENT-CHILD study 
provide another data source for the use of riociguat in children with PAH. Finally, post marketing data are 
available from off-label use in the paediatric population. The approach to safety is acceptable. 
Documented exposure for safety analysis is extremely limited (10.12 person-years), but acceptable in the 
context of the agreed PIP and the rarity of the condition. 
Based on the limited data for all adverse events, the paediatric safety profile is considered consistent with 
the adult data.  
Among the TESAE and AESI, hypotension stands out as possibly preventable. Hypotension is also often 
cited as a cause for treatment discontinuation. The SmPC recommends dose titration based on blood 
pressure.  
Laboratory findings were not remarkable. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
is expected to be similar to safety in adults. The MAH’s conclusion, that no new findings were identified in 
the post marketing data, is agreed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Riociguat was well-tolerated in the paediatric population. All in all, tolerability can be considered similar to 
the adult population.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paediatric PAH is a rare and complex condition associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic 
diseases, significant morbidity and mortality. It shares similarities with adult PAH, but there are important 
known differences in vascular function, fetal origins of disease, growth and development, genetics, 
natural history, underlying disease, responses of the right ventricle, responsiveness to PAH-specific 
therapies, and gaps in knowledge, particularly in the youngest age groups. Because of the limitations in 
conducting paediatric studies, therapeutic strategies used for adult PAH have not been studied sufficiently 
in children to allow the definition of potential toxicities or optimal dosing. 
There is a high medical need for additional treatment options for PAH in light of the poor life expectancy 
and impact on the daily life of children and their relatives despite of available treatment options, and to 
provide treating physicians with suitable instructions and appropriate formulations for paediatric use.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The most important PAH-specific therapies in adults include phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5)-inhibitors, 
endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and prostanoids. Two of these products have also been authorised 
for the paediatric population, PDE5i Revatio (sildenafil) and ERA Volibris (ambrisentan). Bosentan has 
dosing instructions for paediatrics but no indication. Use of other ERAs and prostanoids in the treatment 
of paediatric PAH is common but off-label.  
The most current approach in the management of paediatric PAH promotes the identification of 
appropriate targets for goal-oriented therapy, also considering a risk stratification to determine the need 
for additional therapy. 
To address this unmet medical need, the sponsor initiated a paediatric development program to make 
riociguat, an oral PAH and CTEPH treatment in adults, available for children with PAH. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The completed paediatric development program is in line with the approved EU PIP, EMEA-000718-PIP01-
09-M06 (PIP decision number P/0289/2016) as also indicated by the completed full compliance check by 
the EMA (EMA/PDCO/533423/2020). 
This submission is primarily based on an extrapolation exercise.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 91/103 
 
 
 
 
The MAH submitted one clinical study performed in children (Study 15681, PATENT-CHILD). PATENT-
CHILD was a 24-participant trial in patients 6-<18 years, designed to evaluate PK, safety and tolerability 
with exploratory efficacy endpoints over a time period of 24 weeks. The riociguat dosing regimens used in 
the study were targeted to achieve systemic exposures similar to that observed in adults treated for PAH. 
This study included two dosing regimens: Children with body-weight ≥50 kg received riociguat tablets, 
while children with body weight <50 kg received a granules-for-oral-suspension to achieve bodyweight-
adjusted dosing. Both dosing regimens were chosen to achieve exposure levels in the range seen in 
adults. Long-term data in children are also presented. The primary focus of this submission is the safety 
and efficacy of riociguat for the treatment of PAH to support the use of Adempas tablets in children aged 
6 to <18 years with bodyweight ≥50 kg. 
Because of the small study population and the similarities in exposure for children dosed with tablets and 
granules for oral suspension and the potential switch between formulations due to body weight changes, 
the data for this study are submitted, including children receiving both tablet and oral suspension 
formulations to support the evaluation. 
3.2.  Extrapolation of adult data 
According to the Applicant, several considerations justify the overall approach to extrapolate efficacy from 
adults, including the demonstration of the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the 
response to therapy, as well as the safety of use in all the relevant populations. Although these 
considerations are generally in line with the reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the 
development of medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) and the draft ICH E11A guideline, the 
interpretation differs in terms of similar responses to therapy. 
Disease similarity 
Regarding disease similarity, it is considered that the pathophysiology of PAH is similar among children 
enrolled in PATENT-CHILD (6 to <18 years) and adults. Historically, the definition of PH in children has 
been the same as in adults, i.e. mPAP ≥25 mmHg and PVR ≥ 240 dyn s cm-5 (3 Wood units). However, 
the distribution of PAH aetiologies in children is different from that in adults, with a larger proportion of 
PAH associated with CHD in children, whereas in both populations, the majority of patients have IPAH.  
Similar drug pharmacology 
The hemodynamic mechanism of action of riociguat as an sGC stimulator is responsible for PAH efficacy 
and is expected to be similar in adults and children. This does, however, not automatically mean that 
there is similar drug pharmacology, which also refers to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) properties besides mechanism of action. For example, the mean exposure obtained in 
the paediatric population in the PATENT-CHILD Study was clearly lower than in adult PAH patients, i.e. 
towards the 25th percentile for all comparison groups. Furthermore, it was shown that for a major part of 
the paediatric subjects (9/24) dosed in the PATENT-CHILD Study 15681, clearance was higher than 
predicted from the PBPK model. This lower exposure in paediatric patients is only partially explained by 
the lower dose-equivalents for children in the maintenance phase of PATENT-CHILD than for the adult 
population and the presence of increased riociguat clearance in a part of the paediatric population. 
However, lower exposure in the paediatric population does not lead to reduced efficacy in this population. 
These findings are consistent with the corresponding PK/PD profiles in adult subjects with PAH, i.e. no 
clear relationship between changes in 6MWD and riociguat trough concentrations. 
Similar exposure response  
Similar exposure-response between the adult and paediatric populations could not be demonstrated. In 
adult PH patients, there is a close and direct relationship between riociguat plasma concentrations and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 92/103 
 
 
 
 
haemodynamic effects such as decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR), decrease in systolic blood pressure (SB) and increase in cardiac output (CO) after 
administration of a wide range of single doses (0.5 – 5 mg) or at steady state (1.0 – 2.5 mg TID). 
However, such a relationship between plasma concentrations and haemodynamic effects has not been 
demonstrated for the paediatric population since right heart catheterization (RHC) to assess such 
haemodynamic parameters was not performed in the paediatric subjects in the PATENT-CHILD study and 
exposure-effect for blood pressure and echographic measurements were not reported. Therefore, PK/PD 
relationships were investigated for 6MWD and NT-proBNP. However, no PK/PD relationship between 
riociguat exposure and 6MWD or NT-proBNP were observed in the adult and the paediatric population.  
Discussion and conclusion 
According to the reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for 
paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) the primary focus will usually be to establish a line of reasoning about 
the relationship between dose, exposure, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and clinical responses.  
However, there is no proof that similar exposures result in similar pharmacodynamic effects. Moreover, in 
both adult and the paediatric population no PK/PD relationship was observed between riociguat exposure 
and 6MWD nor NT-proBNP. Furthermore, side-by-side clinical comparison of the paediatric exploratory 
efficacy data from the PATENT-CHILD study with pooled data from the Phase 3 studies in adults (PATENT-
1 and PATENT-2), demonstrated that the efficacy outcomes of PATENT-CHILD show a favourable trend in 
the direction of PATENT-1/-2. However, firm conclusions on a similar effect size in terms of 6MWD and 
NT-proBNP improvement achieved with a comparable riociguat exposure between the paediatric PAH 
population and the adult PAH population are difficult to made due to the limited sample size in the 
paediatric population, the fact that the paediatric patients appear at lower risk for progression at baseline 
and the high variability (SD) in the key efficacy outcomes. Nevertheless, in the PATENT-CHILD trial there 
was a positive trend in improvement in exercise capacity (mean change of 23.01 m at week 24; see also 
below). Responder analyses showed that 9 of 19 subjects in PATIENT-CHILD (47.4%; 3 subjects ≥ 6 to 12 
years and 6 subjects ≥12 to < 18 years) had an improvement by at least 20 m at week 24. To note, an 
improvement of 20 m is considered clinically relevant in adults. Therefore, the favourable trend can be 
considered of clinical relevance. Furthermore, differences in PK/PD responses between adults and 
paediatric subjects are not anticipated.  
Overall, given the favourable trend in 6MWD in the direction of the adult population and the similar safety 
profiles between adults and the paediatric population, extrapolation of data is acceptable. 
3.3.  Favourable effects 
No confirmatory evidence for efficacy has been submitted. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The evaluation of efficacy is based on data obtained from the clinical program in the paediatric 
population, comprising data from the 24-week main phase of the pivotal Phase 3 study PATENT-CHILD 
(Study 15681), conducted in subjects ≥6 years to <18 years in the PAH indication. In this study, children 
with bodyweight ≥50 kg received riociguat tablets according to the dosing regimen approved for adults, 
while children with bodyweight <50 kg received a body weight-adjusted dose using granules for oral 
suspension. In both cases, these dosing regimens were aimed at achieving riociguat systemic exposures 
in the range of that seen in adults. Because of this and the small size of PATENT-CHILD, the data for 
PATENT-CHILD are presented in its totality to support the evaluation. The granules formulation has not 
yet been proposed for authorisation by the MAH.

Exploratory results for benefits 
In PATENT-CHILD, exploratory efficacy evaluation was based on 6MWD, WHO FC, NT-proBNP, QoL and 
echocardiographic parameters at Week 24 compared to baseline and TTCW. In addition, subjects who 
required treatment with riociguat for more than 24 weeks were offered participation in the optional long-
term extension part. 
At baseline, as expected, the mean 6MWD was 442.12 m and was higher with increased age. The mean 
6MWD at baseline was higher in the subgroup of subjects receiving ERA + PCA as concomitant PAH 
medications than those receiving ERA only as concomitant PAH medications.  
In the overall population, between baseline and Week 24 (Visit 9), an improvement in 6MWD was seen 
with a mean change of 23.01 m. The positive mean change of 6MWD from baseline was also seen in the 
two age subgroups (<12/≥12 years) and the subgroup of subjects receiving ERA + PCA as concomitant 
PAH medications but not in those receiving ERA only as concomitant PAH medication. Responder analyses 
showed that 9 of 19 subjects in PATIENT-CHILD (47.4%; 3 subjects ≥ 6 to 12 years and 6 subjects ≥12 to 
< 18 years) had an improvement by at least  20 m at week 24. 
The findings for NT-proBNP were consistent with 6MWD, namely that beneficial trends were observed. 
Such improvement trends were also seen in the SF 10 and Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 
scores. 
Clinical worsening was observed in 2 (8.3%) subjects in total who were reported with hospitalization for 
right heart failure. Both subjects were in the subgroup of ≥ 12 to < 18 years, one subject was in the 
subgroup of receiving ERA only as concomitant PAH medication and one subject was in the subgroup of 
receiving ERA + PCA. Both patients had idiopathic PAH. 
The majority of subjects (18 [75.0%]) had a WHO functional class of II at baseline. No changes in WHO 
functional class were seen between baseline and Week 24.  
Right heart catheterization (RHC) was not indicated in the Clinical Study Protocol. Therefore, a PK/PD 
analysis for hemodynamic parameters, e.g. pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), cardiac index, etc, was 
not applicable. 
Although trends of improvement were seen in single echocardiographic parameters such as right 
ventricular cardiac output (RV-CO; 16 participants), the PK/PD analysis revealed no significant correlation 
between change in echocardiographic parameters and riociguat exposure due to the limited number of 
subjects with echocardiographic measurements and the high standard deviation 
Overall, the improvements or maintenance of the riociguat treatment effect observed for paediatric 
subjects on-treatment with riociguat for up to 2 years were generally consistent with long-term effects in 
the adult population. 
During the optional LTE phase, improvements or stabilization in 6MWD were maintained for eligible 
subjects on treatment with observed mean changes from baseline of +5.86 m (SD 44.56; n=16) at 
months 6, -3.43 m (SD 74.77, n=12) at Month 12; +28.98 m (SD 66.71, n=9) at Month 18 and -11.80 m 
(SD 35.40, n=4) at Month 24. Later visits only included data from 4 or fewer subjects.  
A majority of subjects remained stable on treatment regarding WHO functional class II between baseline 
and Month 24. Another six subjects in the subgroup of ≥12 to <18 years experienced a clinical worsening: 
2 subjects each following lung transplantation or due to deterioration of WHO FC and one subject each for 
hospitalization due to right heart failure or deterioration of PAH (worsening of cardiac catheterization 
parameters). No deaths occurred during the observation period.

Sample size 
The sample size of PATENT-CHILD did not provide sufficient power for confirmatory analyses. This holds 
especially true when evaluating the results in the small subgroups of different disease etiologies (4 
subjects diagnosed with congenital heart disease associated PAH after shunt closure (CHD-PAH) and 18 
subjects with idiopathic PAH). Low subject numbers, are a known restriction for most paediatric 
development programs in PAH. The design of PATENT-CHILD was agreed to by the PDCO. 
Efficacy in a pre-treated paediatric population 
Potential reasons for the observed lower magnitude of effect on 6MWD in the paediatric population may 
be related to (1) higher mean 6MWD at baseline (442.1 m in PATENT-CHILD compared to 361.4 m and 
368.2 m in adult trial PATENT-1 [Pool 1 and Pool 1-matched exposure group, respectively]), (2) a higher 
proportion of patients with WHO functional class II at baseline (75% in PATENT-CHILD compared to 
42.5% and 45.5% in PATENT-1, respectively), and (3) a greater proportion of patients on background 
PAH medications at baseline (100% in PATENT-CHILD compared to 51.6% and 60.6% in PATENT-1, 
respectively). 
3.5.  Unfavourable effects 
Hypotension is the most relevant associated risk due to riociguat’s pharmacological properties and mode 
of action via vasodilation. This risk has been thoroughly characterized since the beginning of the riociguat 
development in adults.  
The MoA of riociguat is the same in the adult and paediatric populations. Therefore, the observed AEs are 
mostly based on the MoA and are not age/ population specific. 
The observed safety profile in the paediatric population (PATENT-CHILD) is consistent with what has been 
observed in adults and as described in the label. 
In the PATENT-CHILD study, hypotension or diastolic hypotension was reported in 4/24 subjects (16.7%) 
during the main phase of the study. The applied systolic blood pressure monitoring during the titration 
phase allowed early identification of subjects susceptible to hypotension, and dose adjustments were 
made. 
In an integrated analysis comparing PATENT-CHILD data to adult data, the incidence rate of hypotension 
in the paediatric population was comparable to that observed in the adult population: 16.7% (N = 24) 
and 13.5% (N = 490), respectively. 
As expected for a longer reporting period, higher frequencies of drug-related TEAEs were reported when 
including the LTE phase (37.5%) compared to the main phase (29.2%) of PATENT-CHILD. The most 
common adverse reactions, including the long-term extension phase, were hypotension and headaches. 
Based on the data of the paediatric subjects enrolled in PATENT-CHILD, the paediatric safety profile of 
riociguat was similar to adults, and riociguat administered as a tablet or oral suspension was well-
tolerated. 
No new safety findings were observed in the paediatric population.

3.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
This open-label study introduced a treatment, riociguat, previously unknown to most investigators for 
children. 
Open-label design 
PATENT-CHILD was conducted with a single-treatment arm in an open-label fashion. An open-label design 
was agreed to with PDCO during the original PIP review. All participants used concomitant medication. 
No data is available in children below 6 years of age 
Due to the bone findings in juvenile rat studies, the study of riociguat use was waived in children below 6 
years of age.  
Bone effects 
PATENT-CHILD was too short of concluding the potential bone effects of riociguat in patients 6-<18 years 
of age.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The extrapolation concept is considered sufficient despite the uncertainty regarding the principle of 
demonstration of similarity of exposure-response between the paediatric and adult populations. In the 
PATENT-CHILD trial there was a positive trend in improvement in exercise capacity (mean change of 
23.01 m at week 24), which can be considered of clinical relevance, and favourable trends in the 
exploratory endpoints of, WHO FC, NT-proBNP, QoL and echocardiographic parameters; although, the 
sample size of this study did not provide sufficient power for confirmatory analyses. Overall, given the 
favourable trend in 6MWD in the direction of the adult population and the similar safety profiles between 
adults and the paediatric population, extrapolation of data is considered valid.  
3.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy and safety profile of riociguat is well-established for adults, having been evaluated in 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (PATENT 1 and CHEST 1) of more than 650 subjects. The proposed 
extension of indication is primarily based on extrapolation of the adult data. Riociguat’s mechanism of 
action as sGC stimulator applies to the disease in adults and children. Also, disease aetiology differs 
between paediatrics and adults, although the types of PAH (IPAH and HPAH) in the paediatric population 
enrolled in PATENT-CHILD were consistent with those included in PATENT-1; in the paediatric population, 
a higher proportion of subjects with CHD-PAH was reported. The pathophysiological features of the types 
of PAH included may be similar in the adult and the paediatric population.  
According to the guideline on the clinical investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (EMA/CHMP/213972/2010), for medicinal products where the benefit-risk 
profile is known in adult PAH, “an extensive paediatric development is not foreseen as their efficacy and 
safety are already established in adult PAH. The main remaining issues in paediatric clinical development 
is defining the therapeutic dose, and short and long-term safety. Considering their mechanism of action, 
the primary endpoint for the dose-finding study should be haemodynamic parameters measured at 12 
weeks”. According to the same guideline, invasive measurements are the only acceptable haemodynamic 
endpoints. However, right heart catheterization (RHC) was not indicated in the Clinical Study Protocol. 
This was consistent with RHC not being recommended in paediatric studies due to the high rate of serious 
complications (Ollivier et al. 2019), which is acknowledged. It has to be noted that the completed 
paediatric development program is in line with the approved EU PIP, EMEA-000718-PIP01-09-M06 (PIP 
decision number P/0289/2016) as also indicated by the completed full compliance check by the EMA 
(EMA/PDCO/533423/2020). Since hemodynamic parameters measured via RHC were not obtained in 
PATENT-CHILD, a PK/PD analysis for hemodynamic parameters, e.g. pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR), cardiac index, etc, was not applicable. Therefore, PK/PD relationships were investigated for the 
exercise capacity test 6-minute walking distance test (6MWD) and the biomarker NT-proBNP. However, in 
both adult and the paediatric population no PK/PD relationship was observed between riociguat exposure 
and 6MWD nor NT-proBNP. 
Based on the efficacy results from PATENT-CHILD, such as 6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP, 
only favourable trends were reported in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 18 years. Furthermore, 
due to the low sample size and the high variability, some effects are difficult to interpret. For example, in 
the overall population, between baseline and Week 24 (Visit 9), an improvement in 6MWD was seen with 
a mean change of 23.01 m. The positive mean change of 6MWD from baseline was also seen in the two

age subgroups (<12/≥12 years) and the subgroup of subjects receiving ERA + PCA as concomitant PAH 
medications but not in those receiving ERA only as concomitant PAH medication. 
Available safety data show a similar profile as observed in the adult population, mostly attributed to the 
mode of action of riociguat or the underlying disease. Hypotension is the most common reaction, whereas 
blood pressure is also monitored for dose titration. No new safety concern was identified in the completed 
main part, and ongoing LTE part of PATENT-CHILD, and the currently available data do not indicate 
important differences in the safety profile with what has been observed in adults and as described in the 
approved Product Information. 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Adempas in the paediatric population is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to add the treatment of PAH in paediatric patients aged less than 18 years of age 
and body weight ≥ 50 kg with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III in combination with endothelin receptor 
antagonists for ADEMPAS, based on results from pivotal study PATENT-CHILD (Study 15681); this is a 
Phase III, Open-label, individual dose titration study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
of riociguat in children from 6 to less than 18 years of age with PAH;  As a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 8.4 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/229554/2023 
Page 100/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Investigation Plan P/0289/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Adempas is not similar to Opsumit within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

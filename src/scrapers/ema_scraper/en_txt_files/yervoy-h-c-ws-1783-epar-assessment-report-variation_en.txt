2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases diagnosed yearly, and 
an estimated 1.6 million deaths worldwide (Brambilla et al, 2014). NSCLC represents approximately 
85% of all lung cancers and includes SQ and NSQ cell carcinoma, which encompasses a variety of 
histological subtypes including adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and less common subtypes 
(Brambilla et al, 2014; Brambilla et al, 2001; Beasley et al, 2005; Schrump et al, 2011 chapter 75). 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication is:

Page 7/157 
 
 
 
•  OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults with no EGFR or ALK 
positive tumour mutations. 
• 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults with no EGFR or ALK 
positive tumour mutations. 
Management 
Until recently, platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone was the recommended standard of care for first-
line treatment of metastatic NSCLC, with the exception of small subgroups of patients with NSCLC 
tumours harbouring known driver mutations (eg, EGFR and ALK) (National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines and European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] guidelines). 
Most patients experience disease progression during the first year of treatment, with only 10% to 20% 
of patients who are progression free at 18 months and less than one-fourth to one-fifth of patients 
alive at 2 years. 
Platinum-based chemotherapy alone remains a treatment option in certain cases of advanced NSCLC, 
such as when patients are not considered candidates to receive immunotherapy. Platinum doublets are 
used interchangeably and selected based on physician and patient preferences and comorbidities, with 
the exception of pemetrexed- and gemcitabine-based doublets, which are reserved for NSQ and SQ 
histology, respectively. Efforts to improve the efficacy of platinum-based doublet therapies for 
advanced and metastatic NSCLC have focused on the addition of targeted agents (eg, bevacizumab in 
NSQ and necitumumab in SQ) or anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapies and on the use of maintenance 
therapy (eg, erlotinib or pemetrexed in NSQ) for subjects who did not progress on platinum-based 
first-line therapy. 
Despite the recent approvals of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapies (either as monotherapy or in 
combination with chemotherapy), outcomes in 1L NSCLC remain poor, with potential improvement in 
long-term OS likely limited to the subjects with tumours responding to the anti-PD-(L)1 component of 
the regimens. Incremental responses observed with the addition of chemotherapy to PD-(L)1 inhibitors 
improve initial disease control, but appear to be rapidly lost, and unlikely to contribute to improved 
long-term outcomes. 
Table 1 shows the European Union (EU)-approved first-line treatments for metastatic NSCLC other 
than those only approved for subgroups defined by genetic driver mutations. To date, no regimens 
with 2 immunotherapy agents (anti-PD-(L)1 + anti-CTLA-4) with or without chemotherapy are 
approved for treatment of first-line NSCLC.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab each have distinct, but complementary, mechanisms of action, which may 
enhance responsiveness to the combination regardless of baseline tumour PD-L1 expression (Figure 1 
Mechanisms of action of ipilimumab and nivolumab). 
Nivolumab (nivo) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its 
interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  
Ipilimumab (ipi) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA-4. CTLA-4 inhibition can induce 
de novo T-cell responses and recruit novel/additional T cells to the tumour. 
Adding limited doses of chemotherapy (2 cycles) to the nivo+ipi regimen could further enhance the 
immunogenic effect of nivo+ipi by releasing neoantigens from apoptosing tumour cells, increasing 
antigen presentation to dendritic cells, decreasing the myeloid-derived suppressive cells and increasing 
the ratio of cytotoxic lymphocytes to regulatory T-cells. 
Figure 1 Mechanisms of action of ipilimumab and nivolumab 
The authorised indications are: 
For OPDIVO:  
Melanoma 
OPDIVO as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour 
PD-L1 expression. 
Adjuvant treatment of melanoma 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with melanoma with 
involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer after prior chemotherapy in adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 10/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior 
therapy in adults. 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin.  
Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer 
of the head and neck in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy. 
Urothelial carcinoma 
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy. 
For Yervoy: 
Melanoma 
YERVOY as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma in adults, and adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour 
PD-L1 expression. 
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
The new proposed indication is the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of 
platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults with no EGFR 
or ALK positive tumour mutations. 
The recommended dose of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy is 360 mg 
nivolumab administered intravenously (IV) Q3W in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered 
IV Q6W, and platinum chemotherapy administered Q3W. After completion of 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy, treatment is continued with 360 mg nivolumab administered IV Q3W in combination 
with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q6W. Treatment is recommended until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No Scientific Advice have been requested to CHMP in regard to this development.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
As claimed by the applicant, the studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), as defined by the International Council on Harmonization and in accordance with the ethical 
principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). 
However, for study CA 209227 a triggered GCP inspection conducted in Q2 2019 revealed system-
related deficiencies at the sponsor site and at the CRO, related to a lack of solid measures to prevent 
dissemination of information to authorised/non authorised personnel within a non-robust and 
immature risk management system. In these regards the company has provided during assessment 
reassuring data that indicate that the pivotal study supporting this extension of indication is acceptable 
on the GCP aspect (see 2.4.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substances, nivolumab and ipilimumab are proteins and therefore no environmental risk 
assessment studies have been submitted, in line with guidelines. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical studies to support the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab were Phase I study 
CA209012 (Cohorts G-J, N-Q). Phase II study CA209568, Phase III study CA209227 and Supportive 
Phase III study CA209026. However, study CA209227 was amended several times. A triggered GCP 
inspection revealed system-related deficiencies at the sponsor site and at the CRO related to a lack of 
solid measures to prevent dissemination of information to authorised/non authorised personnel within 
a non-robust and immature risk management system. It could not be excluded that the protocol 
amendments were data-driven, and trial integrity could not be ascertained. Therefore, reliable 
conclusions could not be drawn, and clinical efficacy was not considered established in any particular 
target population. 
In parallel, mainly due to the crossing of the curves during the first months of treatment with 
immunotherapy vs. chemotherapy, the development also focussed on the use of the combination of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab with 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The current application applies for an 
indication for this treatment combination.  
The clinical studies to support this application are: 
• 
• 
• 
Phase II study CA209568 Part 2 (nivo/ipi/chemo) 
Phase III study CA2099LA (nivo/ipi/chemo vs chemo)

were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
PK bioanalytical Methods 
Validated bioanalytical methods were used to support the clinical pharmacology programs of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab. A total of four analytical methods were used; 
−  Serum  concentrations  of  nivolumab  were  analysed  at  Syngene  International  Ltd.  (Bangalore, 
India) using a validated ECL assay (Method BAL-II/MOA/061). 
−  Serum concentrations of nivolumab for China subjects were analysed at WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, 
P. R. China) using a validated ECL assay (Method 14BASM122). 
−  Serum concentrations of ipilimumab were analysed at PPD Inc. (Richmond, VA) using a validated 
ELISA assay (Method ICD 267). 
−  Serum  concentrations  of  ipilimumab  for  China  subjects  were  analysed  at  WuXi  AppTec 
(Shanghai, P. R. China) using a validated ELISA assay (Method 13BASM127). 
In  general,  all  the  analytical  methods  were  validated  successfully  with  respect  to  matrix  selectivity, 
sensitivity,  calibration  curve  fitting,  accuracy,  precision  (total  error),  MRD,  dilution  linearity  and  hook 
effect, haemolysis and lipemic effect and carryover. Analytes stability was demonstrated for freeze/thaw, 
room temperature, processed stability and refrigerated stability. Long-term matrix and solution stability 
was also established. 
Since all the four bioanalytical methods to determine the concentration of nivolumab and ipilimumab in 
study  CA2099LA,  cross-validations  were  performed  between  assay  Methods  BAL  II/MOA/061  and 
14BASM122 for nivolumab and Methods ICD 267 and 13BASM127 for ipilimumab (using QCs and incurred 
patient samples). The results of both cross-validation show that concentrations generated by the two 
testing labs at PPD and WuXi produced equivalent results for both analytes. 
In-study validation 
Since additional sample analysis was performed, the data generated was reported in several addenda to 
the bioanalytical study report. Previous analyses for this study are presented in the RFEA bioanalytical 
study report issued on January 20th, 2017, in the RFEA2 bioanalytical study report issued on May 22nd, 
2017, in the RFEA3 bioanalytical study report addendum 2 issued on February 06th, 2018 and the RFEA3 
bioanalytical study report addendum 3 issued on November 07th, 2018. 
The in-study validations have been submitted for both clinical studies CA2099LA and CA209227. The 
in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs.  
Study samples analysed and reported for nivolumab and ipilimumab in support of studies CA2099LA 
and CA209227 were covered by the long-term stability demonstrated at nominal at -70 ºC. 
The reasons for the samples re-assayed for both analytes in each study are considered acceptable. 
The incurred sample re-analysis was performed in study CA2099LA for both analytes. The results show 
that the ISR measurements were within ±30% deviations.

Nivolumab Base model 
Base model development consisted of re-estimating parameters of the previously developed full model 
(with ipilimumab combination effect removed), which had been developed to characterise PK for 
nivolumab combination therapy in subjects with previously untreated NSCLC.  
The base model was a two-compartment, zero-order IV infusion PK model, with time-varying CL 
(sigmoidal-Emax function); and a proportional residual error model, with random effects on CL, Q, VC, 
VP, and EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The variance of random effect 
was estimated jointly for the two CL parameters (CL, Q) and for the two volume parameters (VC, VP). 
The base model contained BBWT, sex, race, GFR, PS, and line of therapy, tumour type on CL, BBWT 
and sex on VC, BBWT on Q, BBWT on VP, and PS on EMAX. Parameter estimates for this model are 
presented in Table 5.1.1.1-1. Baseline albumin was not included as a covariate as more than 20% of 
subjects have missing values. The stability of the base model was assessed by the condition number 
calculated from eigenvalues in the NONMEM output. The condition number of the base model was 
found to be 141, indicating the base model was stable (as the value is < 1000).

Nivolumab final model 
The full model was developed from the base model by incorporating additional covariates representing 
the effect of regimens of ipilimumab and/or chemotherapy coadministration on the CL of nivolumab. 
Similar to the previous analysis, the effect of ipilimumab coadministration on baseline CL is constant 
and remains present even after ipilimumab dosing is stopped. Serum albumin has previously been 
shown to be a significant covariate for nivolumab CL, but it was not included in the full model as data 
were not available for all the studies in the prior analysis.

Coadministration with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W and 2 cycles of chemotherapy resulted in a 9.6% 
decrease in nivolumab CL compared with nivolumab monotherapy. Coadministration with ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg Q6W resulted in an 8% increase in nivolumab CL compared with nivolumab monotherapy. 
Coadministration with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W or 3 mg/kg Q3W resulted in a 23% and 25% increase 
in nivolumab CL, respectively. Coadministration with chemotherapy resulted in a 13.1% decrease in 
nivolumab CL. Coadministration with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W did not have a statistically significant 
effect on nivolumab CL (95% CI included null value). Nivolumab CL was 12% higher in melanoma 
subjects than in NSCLC subjects. The conditional number of the base model was found to be 192, 
indicating the base model was stable (as the value is < 1000).

chemotherapy relative to nivolumab monotherapy, and the ratio was 5% lower in nivolumab co-
administrated with ipilimumab and chemotherapy, relative to nivolumab monotherapy.

Base model development consisted of re-estimating parameters of the previously developed full model 
(with nivolumab combination effects removed), which was developed to characterize PK for ipilimumab 
combination therapy in subjects with previously untreated NSCLC.11  
The base model was a linear, two compartment model with zero order IV infusion and first order 
elimination; and a combined proportional and additive residual error model, with random effects on CL, 
VC and EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The base model contained BBWT, 
BLDH, tumour effect, and line of therapy on CL, BBWT on VC, Q and VP. In the present analysis, 40 
outliers were identified using the CWRES criteria. These outliers were excluded from subsequent 
analyses. Parameter estimates for this model are presented in Table 5.2.1.1-1. 
The stability of the base model was assessed by the condition number calculated from eigenvalues in 
the NONMEM output. The conditional number of the base model was found to be 54.67, indicting the 
base model was stable (as the value is well below 1000).

Exposure response of efficacy 
The E-R analysis of efficacy included data from 697 subjects with NSCLC in Study CA2099LA, including 
349 subjects who received 4 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy and 348 subjects who received 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W plus 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
treatment, and for whom estimates of both nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures (Cavg1) were 
available. Values of nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 were imputed to be zero for subjects in the 
chemotherapy only arm of CA2099LA and were obtained from the PPK analysis for the remaining 
subjects. Additionally, in order to enable the assessment of log-transformed exposures, the values of 
Cavg1 of nivolumab and ipilimumab of subjects who received only chemotherapy was imputed to be a 
very low value (0.001 µg/mL), as log of zero is not defined.

Table 3.2.1.1-1 provides a summary of the subjects who were included in the analysis. 
The full model estimates are presented in Table 5.1.1.1-1. The parameter estimate between Cavg1 of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab is highly correlated (r > 0.9), suggesting these effects are not completely 
independent. 
Figure 5.1.1.1-1 is a graphical presentation of all the estimated effects in the full model, showing the 
hazard ratios (HR) of OS across the predictor ranges and the associated 95% confidence intervals

Exposure-response of safety 
The initial analysis population for the E-R analysis of safety was identical to the analysis population for 
the E-R analysis of efficacy, and only included the 697 subjects in CA2099LA for whom nivolumab and 
ipilimumab exposures were available. Subsequently, data from 1525 subjects in CA209227 were added 
to the analysis, resulting in a pooled analysis data set of 2222 subjects. 
The pooled analysis data set included data from all subjects in both CA2099LA and CA209227 for 
whom nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures were available. Nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures were 
imputed to zero for subjects who received only chemotherapy, and ipilimumab exposures were 
imputed to zero for subjects who received nivolumab monotherapy, or nivolumab in combination with 
chemotherapy.

The parameter estimates of the model are presented in Table 5.2.1.1-1, and the effects of exposure 
and covariates on the hazard ratio (95% CI) of Gr2+ IMAEs is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1.

The revised full model was developed with data from both CA2099LA and CA209227 using the same 
procedure as the initial full model. The relationship of Gr2+ IMAEs and exposure was best described by 
a log-linear with nivolumab Cavg1, and linear with ipilimumab Cavg1 (lowest BIC). 
The parameter estimates of the model are presented in Table 5.2.1.2-1, and the effects of exposure 
and covariates on the hazard ratio (95% CI) of Gr2+ IMAEs is shown in Figure 5.2.1.2-1. The 
parameters of the model were well estimated given the modest correlation between effects of

nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure (r < |0.6|), and low correlation between all the other estimated 
parameters (r < |0.3|).

The estimated effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 indicate that the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs is 
higher in subjects who receive these agents compared to chemotherapy alone. Additionally, the log-
linear functional form of nivolumab Cavg1, and the magnitude of the estimated effect indicates the 
effect of nivolumab reaches a plateau at the exposures produced by the 3 mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W, 
and 360 mg Q3W doses. On the other hand, the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs is higher for subjects at the 95th 
percentile of exposure produced by an ipilimumab dose of 1 mg/kg Q6W, relative to the 5th percentile 
exposure at the same dose level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 71/157 
 
 
 
 
Importantly, the interaction between nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 was not significant (the model 
without any interaction had the lowest BIC) indicating that the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs due to exposure of 
these agents was additive, and not synergistic. In addition, the potential interaction of the effect of 
chemotherapy was assessed and found to also not be significant (the model without any interaction 
had the lowest BIC). This indicates that chemotherapy does not change the risk of Gr2+ IMAE due to 
nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure. 
The only covariates that had significant effects on the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs were sex and smoking status 
(95% CI excluded null effect). The risk was higher in females relative to males, and lower in non-
smokers compared with current/former smokers. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical methods 
Validated bioanalytical methods were used to support the clinical pharmacology programs of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab. The Method BAL-II/MOA/061 for nivolumab and Method ICD 267 for ipilimumab were 
previously  validated.  In  addition,  updated  cross-validated  bioanalytical  methods  for  nivolumab  and 
ipilimumab  concentrations  used  in  CA2099LA  between  PPD  and  WuXi.  The  results  show  that 
concentrations generated by the two testing labs at PPD and WuXi produced equivalent results  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 72/157 
 
 
 
 
In  general,  the  analytical  methods  were  validated  successfully  with  respect  to  selectivity,  sensitivity, 
calibration curve fitting, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and dilution. Analyte stability was 
demonstrated for freeze/thaw, whole blood stability room temperature and extract storage conditions 
and long-term matrix stability. 
The  in-study  validations  have  been  submitted  for  both  clinical  studies  CA2099LA  and  CA209227.  The 
calibration standards and the QCs were acceptable for both studies. For both studies, the reason for the 
re-analysis of samples are considered acceptable. Study samples analysed and reported for nivolumab 
and ipilimumab in support of studies CA299LA and CA209227 were covered by the long-term stability 
demonstrated at nominal at -70 ºC. 
The incurred sample re-analysis was performed in study CA2099LA for both analytes. The results show 
that the ISR measurements were within ±30% deviations  
Pharmacokinetics 
A model-based analysis has been implemented to describe the pharmacokinetics of both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab based on previous population PK models of nivolumab and ipilimumab developed in 
monotherapy and combination in multiple tumour types, including patients with NSCLC.  
The number of included clinical trials, patients, and observations seems adequate. The proportion of 
data below the limit of quantification is low (<10%), so its exclusion should not be relevant in the 
estimation of PK parameters. 
Base population PK model of nivolumab 
The PK structural model used has been maintained from the previous population models, allowing the 
re-estimation of the PK structural parameters and the previously identified covariates. Despite the fact 
that the condition number is adequate, the effect of several covariates (OTH, LINE and RAA) on CL 
were not statistically significant, since 95% CI includes 0. Furthermore, some of these parameters 
presented RSE values higher than 35%, which indicates high uncertainty in its estimation. A model 
refinement has been implemented, showing a more parsimonious model with similar parameter 
estimates compared to the full model. The current developed model should be used for further model 
evaluation exercises. 
Final population PK model of nivolumab 
The final model incorporates as covariates, the effects on CL and Vc of the schemes combined with 
ipilimumab or nivolumab and/or chemotherapy. This strategy evaluates the effect of the combination 
(nivolumab or ipilimumab and/or chemotherapy) as a categorical effect, without taking into account 
other mechanistic approaches that would justify the changes in CL or Vc with a continuous function 
based on nivolumab or ipilimumab plasma levels. 
According to the pc-VPC (time after last dose), the bias in Vc and an over-estimation of the inter-
individual variability of Vc are confirmed. On the other hand, based on the pc-VPC (time after last 
dose), there is an underestimation of the plasma levels of nivolumab around 24 hours, which indicates 
that the effect of the co-administration of ipilimumab and/or chemotherapy may be biased. The 
influence of patient’s drop-out was suggested to explain the slight bias observed in pc-VPC. Responder 
patients tend to show a greater decrease on CL over time, which may influence model predictions 
observed in pc-VPC.  
Intensive dosage regimens with ipilimumab (Q3W) cause clinically relevant increases in CL, which 
would lead to lower nivolumab plasma levels. However, according to the pc-VPC, this effect is over-
estimated, since the experimental values are not adequately captured by the 95% PI of the 50th

percentile. Therefore, the clinical evaluation of the PK parameters and the exposure endpoints should 
be carried out once the model is updated. 
Final population PK model of ipilimumab 
The statistical significance of several covariates (NSCL, NIVO 0.3 Q3W, and NIVO 3 Q3W) are 
questioned, since their 95% CI includes 0. A clinically relevant effect was observed on patients with 
low body weight (20-30% change in exposure) which may influence the exposure metrics.  
The co-administration of nivolumab modifies the ratio of steady-state clearance to baseline clearance 
in a clinically relevant way. Similarly, co-administration of nivolumab produces a clinically relevant 
increase in CL, which could lead to relevant decrease in ipilimumab exposure. Therefore, it is highly 
relevant to evaluate the impact of co-administration of nivolumab or ipilimumab using a continuous 
function that relates the plasma levels of both analytes. Currently, the effect that the administration of 
nivolumab clearly causes on the PK parameters of ipilimumab have been described empirically, 
allowing inconsistent results (i.e. 3 mg/kg Q3W vs 0.3 and 1 mg/kg Q3W) 
Special populations 
The impact of ethnicity on both nivolumab and ipilimumab CL0 and nivolumab and ipilimumab 
CLss/CL0 seems negligible and within the inter-individual variability observed. However, this analysis 
should be updated once the results from the structural joint population PK model become available.  
Exposure-response of efficacy 
The exposure-response model seems able to characterize the time-course of the cumulative probability 
of death in 1L NSCLC patients for both treatment arms: nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg Q6W + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and 4 cycles of platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy. Due to the absence of nivolumab CL in the chemotherapy arm, nivolumab Cavg was 
initially included in the model. No statistical relationship was found when ipilimumab exposure was 
considered. However, the sensitive analysis revealed nivolumab exposure was not a significant 
predictor of OS, and baseline CL was included. This leads to observe that higher nivolumab Cavg and, 
at the same time, higher baseline nivolumab CL are associated with a high risk of death. The Applicant 
justified the inverse relationship as a consequence of having used data from only 1 dose level and the 
high correlation among both variables. 
Exposure-response of safety: 
The logistic regression model of Gr2+ IMAEs seems capable to describe the cumulative probability of 
the 1st occurrence of a Gr2+ IMAE in 1L NSCLC patients. An additive effect of higher risk of Gr2+ 
IMAEs was linked with nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure compared to the chemotherapy arm. The 
risk of occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs were similar across the exposure of ipilimumab, suggesting that no 
exposure-safety relationship was established. The influence of concomitant administration of 2 cycles 
of platinum-based chemotherapy is unknown. From a clinical pharmacology perspective, it is 
impossible to link the higher risk of Gr2+ IMAEs to the observed exposure of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab. 
The estimated effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 suggest that the risk of IMAEs is lower in 
subjects with higher nivolumab Cavg1, and higher in subjects with higher ipilimumab Cavg1. However, 
these estimated effects are highly and negatively correlated (r = -0.93) and should be interpreted in 
this context. The high negative correlation in the estimated effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 
is not unexpected given the high correlation between these measures of exposure (r = 0.89). The high 
negative correlation indicates that the effect of ipilimumab Cavg1 may be overestimated, whereas the 
Assessment report

Page 74/157 
 
 
 
effect of nivolumab Cavg1 may be underestimated, especially as it is unlikely that the risk of IMAEs 
decreases with higher nivolumab Cavg1. 
Notably, all models that included nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure provided a better fit to the data 
than the null model (which included only covariates and no exposure predictors). Given the high 
negative correlation between the parameter estimates of nivolumab and ipilimumab Cavg1 (r = -93), 
the full model was revised by inclusion of data from CA209227. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Clinical Pharmacology evaluation of nivolumab and ipilimumab in monotherapy and combination 
regimens with and without chemotherapy in subjects with NSCLC has been characterized using 
population PK models previously developed. A model refinement has been implemented to account for 
significant parameter-covariates relationships, which increased the stability of the model.

Phase II Study CA209568 Part 2 (“dose finding”) 
Study CA209568 is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivo+ipi+chemo in 
subjects with stage IV NSCLC previously untreated for advanced diseases. The study includes 2 
independent sub-studies or parts.  
In Part 1 of the study, all patients were treated with nivo+ipi. Part 1 of this study has been assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/WS/1372/0053 (nivo+ipi (TMB) procedure - withdrawn).  
In Part 2, patients are treated with nivo + ipi + chemo in combination with histology-based platinum 
doublet chemotherapy for 2 cycles followed by nivo + ipi until progression or a max for 2 years. This 
Part 2 will be the focus in the current application.

•  Treatment: nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 78/157 
 
 
 
 
 
Nivolumab (360 mg Q3W) was administered with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg Q6W), plus 2 cycles of 
histology-based chemotherapy as follows:  
SQ histology: carboplatin area under the concentration time curve (AUC) 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 (or 
175 mg/m2 as per local institutional practice) 
NSQ histology: carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + pemetrexed 
500 mg/m2 
After 2 cycles, nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment could continue for up to 24 months, or until 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1-defined disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Patients might continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 defined progressive disease, as long as 
they experience an investigator assessed clinical benefit without rapid disease progression, tolerated 
treatment, had a stable performance status, the continuation of treatment would not delay an 
imminent intervention to prevent serious disease complication, and had provided a written informed 
consent for continuation of the immunotherapy.  
•  Treatment Chemotherapy  
Histology dependent, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was selected by the investigator and 
administered on Day 1 Q3W for 4 cycles. Histology-based platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was 
one of the following: 
•  SQ histology: carboplatin AUC 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 (or 175 mg/m2 as per local 
institutional practice) 
•  NSQ histology: carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2;  
After 4 cycles, subjects with NSQ histology could continue to receive optional maintenance 
therapy with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed alone on Day 1 of each 3 weeks until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. 
The investigator had to decide before randomisation if the patients should be treated with cisplatin or 
with carboplatin. 
Objectives 
The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are listed in Table 1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 79/157 
 
 
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
OS was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of death from any cause. OS was censored 
on the last date a subject was known to be alive. Survival follow-up was to be conducted every 3 
months after subject’s off-treatment date. 
PFS (primary definition) was defined as the time from the randomisation date to the date of the first 
documented tumour progression based on BICR assessment (per RECIST 1.1), or death from any 
cause, whichever occurred first. 
−  Subjects who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on 
the date of their death.  
−  Subjects who had not progressed or died were censored on the date of their last evaluable 
tumour assessment.  
−  Subjects who did not have any on-study tumour assessments and did not die were censored 
on the randomization date. 
−  Subjects who started any palliative local therapy or subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a 
prior reported progression were censored at the last evaluable tumour assessment prior to 
initiation of the palliative local therapy or subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever 
procedure occurred first. 
PFS (PFS2, secondary definition) is defined as the time from randomisation to objectively documented 
progression after the next line of therapy, per investigator assessment, or to death from any cause, 
whichever occurred first. Subjects who were alive and without progression after the next line of 
therapy were censored at their last known alive date.  
ORR was defined as the number of randomised subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of 
confirmed CR or PR based on BICR assessments (using RECIST v1.1 criteria), divided by the number of 
all randomised subjects. As part of the evaluation of ORR, duration of response (DoR) and time to 
response (TTR) were evaluated for subjects who achieved confirmed PR or CR. DoR was defined as 
the time between the date of first confirmed documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first 
documented BICR-assessed tumour progression (per RECIST 1.1), or death from any cause, whichever 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 80/157 
 
 
 
 
occurred first.  TTR was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of the first confirmed 
documented response (CR or PR), as assessed by the BICR. TTR was evaluated for responders 
(confirmed CR or PR) only. 
In both arms, on-study tumour assessments began at Week 6 post first dose date (~ 7 days) and were 
performed every 6 weeks (~ 7 days) until Week 48. After Week 48, tumour assessments were 
performed every 12 weeks (~ 7 days) until BICR assessed progression. 
Sample size 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to treatment with nivo+ipi+chemo or chemotherapy. The stratification 
factors for randomisation were: PD-L1 level (≥1% vs < 1% or not quantifiable), histology (SQ vs 
NSQ), and gender (male vs female). 
Blinding (masking) 
The treatments in this study were open-label. 
−  The personnel who conducted the PD-L1 and TMB testing were blinded to treatment group 
assignment of individual subjects during the conduct of the study  
−  The whole BMS clinical study team were blinded to the aggregate treatment group information 
up to database lock 
Select members of the BMS clinical team were unblinded to the treatment group assignment of 
individual subjects during the study in order to monitor the safety of individual subjects. 
Statistical methods 
•  Sample size 
The sample size was based on the comparison of the primary endpoint of OS between nivo+ipi+chemo 
and chemotherapy with a 2-sided overall alpha of 0.05. The number of events was estimated assuming 
an exponential distribution of OS for the chemotherapy arm and a piecewise exponential distribution 
with a 3-month delayed treatment effect for the nivo+ipi+chemo arm. 
Approximately 700 subjects were to be randomised to the nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy arms in 
a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 402 events (i.e., deaths), observed among the 700 randomized subjects, 
would provide 81% power to detect an average hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 with a type 1 error of 0.05 
(2-sided). The average HR of 0.75 resulted from an assumed targeted HR of 1 for the initial 3 months 
and a targeted HR of 0.68 for the time beyond 3 months and corresponded to a 33% increase in the 
median OS (assuming a median OS of 13.93 months for chemotherapy alone and 18.57 months for 
nivo+ipi+chemo, respectively). 
•  Primary outcome: OS analyses  
The analysis of OS to compare nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy was based on a 2-sided stratified 
log-rank test stratified by histology (SQ vs NSQ), sex (male vs female), and PD-L1 level (≥ 1% vs < 
1% or not quantifiable). A Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien and Fleming type of 
boundary was employed to determine the nominal significance level for the interim analysis (nominal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 81/157 
 
 
 
significance level p < 0.033 is based on the actual number of OS events of 351). The stratified HR of 
OS between the treatment groups (nivo+ipi+chemo vs chemotherapy) and corresponding 2-sided 
96.71% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model, with 
treatment arm as a single covariate. In addition, a 2-sided p-value was reported for the analysis of OS. 
For descriptive purposes, a 2-sided 95% CI for the HR was also presented. 
There was 1 planned interim analysis of OS for superiority to be performed at approximately 80% of 
total events, i.e. 322. The stopping boundaries at the interim and final analyses were to be based on 
the actual number of OS events at the time of the analysis using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function 
with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. If the interim analysis was performed exactly at 322 events, the 
boundary in terms of statistical significance for declaring OS superiority would be 0.024 (HR boundary 
of 0.78). The boundary for declaring superiority in terms of statistical significance for the final analysis 
of OS after 402 events would then be 0.042 (HR boundary of 0.82). 
•  Planned interim analyses 
At the time of the 03-Oct-2019 Data Base lock (DBL) the actual number of OS events was 351. The 
planned interim analysis was performed and the primary analysis of OS for nivo+ipi+chemo vs 
chemotherapy crossed the pre-specified boundary for statistical significance (nominal significance level 
p < 0.033). Therefore, a final CSR was prepared based on the 03-Oct-2019 DBL.  
•  Secondary outcome: PFS  
Comparison of PFS per BICR was a key secondary objective. 596 events would provide approximately 
94% power to detect a HR of 0.75 with a type 1 error of 0.05 (2-sided). 
The secondary objectives of this study (PFS and ORR by BICR assessment) were assessed using a 
hierarchical testing procedurei with an overall experiment-wise 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.05.  
PFS (primary definition adjusting for subsequent therapy) was compared between the treatment 
groups via a stratified log-rank test among all randomised subjects. The stratification factors were 
histology (SQ vs NSQ), sex (male vs female), and PD-L1 level (≥ 1% vs < 1% or not quantifiable). At 
the time of the database lock, the actual number of PFS per BICR events was 481; therefore, the 
O’Brien and Fleming adjusted alpha = 0.0252 was applied. The 2-sided log-rank p-value was reported. 
•  Secondary outcome: ORR and DOR 
The number and percentage of subjects in each category of BOR per BICR (complete response [CR], 
partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], or unable to determine [UTD]) 
were presented, by treatment group. Estimates of response rate, along with its exact 2-sided 95% CI 
by Clopper and Pearson ii were presented, by treatment group. An estimate of the difference in 
response rates between the treatment groups along with the corresponding 2-sided 97.5% CI were 
computed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method of weighting, adjusting for stratification 
factorsiii.  
The DoR for each treatment group was estimated using KM product limit method for subjects who 
achieved PR or CR, including median values, 2-sided 95% CIs, and range.  
Defined Populations 
During the trial, the following patient populations were defined: 
•  Enrolled: Enrolled subjects who signed an ICF and were registered in IRT (used for 
pre-treatment disposition). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 82/157 
 
 
 
•  Randomised: Subjects randomised to any treatment arm (used for demography, protocol 
deviations, baseline characteristics, efficacy) 
•  Treated: Treated subjects, who received at least 1 dose of study drug (used for drug 
exposure and safety) 
Immunogenicity subjects: treated subjects with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment for 
ADA (used for immunogenicity). 
Amendment No 02 
In amendment No02, the study sample size was expanded from 420 to 700 participants to maintain 
the power of the study to account for the adjusted HR from 0.65 to 0.70 assumption for the primary 
objective and to allow for subgroup analyses. It removed 1-year re-treatment following progression 
after maximum 2 years treatment duration and updated study endpoints i.e. TMB will be assessed in 
both tissue and blood and the endpoint PFS2 was added.  
Amendment No 04 
Amendment No04 affected the statistical analyses, number of interim analyses and the endpoints.  
•  Statistical model adjustments and interim analyses 
The study was amended because since the original design of the study, findings in other studies 
assessing PD-1(L1) inhibitor + chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC showed PD-(L)1 inhibitor + 
chemotherapy treatment was superior to chemotherapy alone, but showed a delayed effect in terms of 
OS with late separation of the OS. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
The study CA2099LA was revised to ensure a sufficient power to detect a survival benefit when a 
delayed effect (late separation of curves after 3 months) occurred and the HR was adjusted.  
In addition, the number of planned interim analyses was limited from two to one.  
•  Endpoint: blood TMB was moved from exploratory endpoints to secondary endpoint 
The blood TMB was moved from an exploratory to a secondary endpoint, because based on the result 
of external data (results from the study conducted with durvalumab (MYSTIC trial) and atezolizumab 
(OAK and POPLAR studies)). It was hypothesised that blood TMB may correlate with efficacy of 
immunotherapy with chemotherapy.

Data monitoring committee 
During the study, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) was established to provide oversight of the 
safety and efficacy considerations in study CA2099LA and to provide advice to BMS regarding actions 
deemed necessary of the continuing protection of enrolled subjects and those to be recruited, as well 
as for the continuing validity and scientific merit of the study results.  
The DMC members had no conflict of interest that could bias their opinion. 
Results 
Recruitment and participant flow 
A total of 719 patients were randomised in 103 sites in 19 countries. The first patient was randomised 
03 Oct 2017; the last patient was randomised 30 Jan 2019. 
From the 1150 patients that signed an informed consent a total of 431 subjects were not randomised 
(37.5%) with the most common reason that inclusion/exclusion criteria were no longer met (85.4%). 
Among the criteria not fulfilled, the most common were ECOG PS ≤1 not confirmed prior to 
randomisation, tumour tissue sample not available at a central laboratory for PD-L1 IHC testing, 
presence of untreated CNS metastases and presence of sensitising EGFR mutation or unknown or 
indeterminate EGFR status for patients with NSQ histology.

Protocol deviations 
Significant protocol deviations were defined as study conduct that differed significantly from the 
protocol, including GCP noncompliance. A summary of significant protocol deviations is provided by 
category and subcategory in Table 4.3.1-1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 86/157 
 
 
 
 
Relevant protocol deviations are those that are related to inclusion or exclusion criteria, study conduct, 
study management, or subject assessment that were programmable and could potentially affect the 
interpretability of study results. Relevant protocol deviations are predefined in the SAP. 
Subjects with relevant protocol deviations are summarised in Table 4.3.2-1. Overall, relevant protocol 
deviations (at study entry and on-treatment) were reported in a total of 11 (1.5%) randomised 
subjects: 7 (1.9%) in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, 4 (1.1%) in the chemotherapy arm.

Baseline data 
Overall the baseline key demographics and disease characteristics appeared to be comparable (Table 
4). 
Table 4 Key Baseline Characteristics in All Randomised Subjects

Page 88/157 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 25 (6.9%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 22 (6.1%) in the chemotherapy arm 
received prior systemic anticancer therapy (platinum-based agent or other chemotherapy) in the 
adjuvant, neo-adjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation setting. 
108 (29.9%) of patients in the nivo+ipi+ chemo arm and 91 (25.4%) in the chemotherapy arm 
received prior surgery related to cancer. 105 (29.1%) in the nivo +ipi + chemo arm and 83 (23.2%) in 
the chemotherapy arm received prior radiotherapy.

Outcomes and estimation (data cut-off date 3 Oct 2019) 
Primary Endpoint Overall Survival 
After a total of N=351/719 (49%) events, Nivo+ipi+chemo showed a median overall survival of 14.13 
(95% CI: 13.24, 16.16) months compared to 10.74 (95% CI: 9.46, 12.45) months in the 
chemotherapy arm. This resulted in an overall improvement of 4 months, resulting in an HR of 0.69 
(96.71% CI: 0.55, 0.87); stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0006 (Figure 5). 
At database lock, 56.8% and 45.5% of randomised subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy 
arms, respectively, were censored for OS (Figure 5).

No crossing of curves occurred during the first months of treatment, although at 15 months the curves 
seem to touch, but interpretation is hampered by the large amount of censoring. Updated efficacy data 
(data cut-off date 09 Mar 2020) were submitted confirming the separation of the curves, see figure 
below.

Secondary endpoint, progression free survival 
After a total of N=481 (67%) events, nivo+ipi+chemo showed a median progression free survival of 
6.83 (95% CI: 5.55, 7.66) months compared to 4.96 (95% CI: 4.27, 5.55) months in the 
chemotherapy arm. This resulted in an overall median improvement of 1.9 months, resulting in a HR = 
0.72 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.86); stratified log-rank test p value = 0.0001.

Symbols represent censored observations. 
The primary definition of PFS accounts for subsequent therapy by censoring at the last evaluable 
tumour assessment on or prior to the date of subsequent therapy. 
Secondary endpoint, PFS2 
Median PFS2 per investigator were 13.34 (95% CI: 11.86, 14.46) and 8.71 (95% CI: 7.43, 9.79) 
months for nivo+ipi+chemo vs chemotherapy, respectively. HR favoured the nivo+ipi+chemo arm 
over the chemotherapy arm: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.76). A total of 175 (48.5%) subjects in the 
nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 226 (63.1%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm were censored (Figure 7).

Secondary endpoint: objective response rate 
In all randomised subjects, BICR-assessed ORR was significantly higher with nivo+ipi+chemo than 
with chemotherapy: 37.7% (95% CI: 32.7, 42.9) vs 25.1% (95% CI: 20.7, 30.0); stratified CMH test 
p-value = 0.0003 (Table 9).

The nivo+ipi+chemo therapy group showed a prolonged median TTR per BICR of 2.51 months for all 
confirmed responses, compared to 1.56 months for the chemotherapy group. 
The nivo+ipi+chemo therapy group showed median DoR of 10.2 (95% CI 8.21, 13.01) compared to 
5.09 (4.34, 7.00) for the chemotherapy group.

Ancillary analyses (data cut-off date 3 Oct 2019) 
The subgroups analyses showed an overall outcome favouring the combination treatment compared to 
chemotherapy, including the subgroups according to the stratification factors gender, PD-L1 status and 
histology. The two subgroups according to PD-L1 expression and histology will be described in more 
detail below. 
The subgroups that favoured the chemotherapy arm were the small subgroups of patients aged ≥75 
years (n=70), the subgroups of never smokers (n=99) and the patients with unquantifiable PD-L1 
expression (n=46).

Table 9 Forest Plot of Treatment Effect on Overall Survival in Predefined Subsets - All 
Randomised Subjects 
In a subgroup analysis for all randomised subjects, PFS HRs by primary definition for most subgroups 
favoured (HR < 1) the nivo+ipi+chemo treatment, including the subgroups according to gender, 
histology and PD-L1 status. The subgroups according to histology and PD-L1 status will be described in 
more detail below.

Minimum follow-up (date of the last subject randomised to date of the cutoff for OS) was 8.1 months 
for OS; median follow-up (date of randomisation to the last known date alive or death date) was 10.35 
months for the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 9.07 months for the chemo arm. The OS medians would 
likely be influenced by a high proportion of censored subjects.

b Stratified Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard Ratio is Nivo+Ipi+Chemo over Chemotherapy. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The subgroup of elderly patients i.e. aged ≥ 75 was limited in study CA2099LA. A total of n=70 were 
included, a total of n=37 were randomised to nivo+ipi+chemo and a total of n=33 were randomised to 
chemotherapy. 
Main results 
Primary efficacy 
The patient group aged ≥ 75 years shows a decreased overall survival compared with chemotherapy: 
HR 1.36 (95% CI 0.74, 2.52). The nivo+ipi+chemo group shows a mOS 8.51 (95% CI 5.59, 13.39) 
months and the chemotherapy group shows a mOS of 10.91 (95% CI 5.75, NA) months (Table 7). 
PFS 
The subgroup of elderly patients ≥ 75 years show a reduced PFS HR 1.12 (95% CI 0.61, 1.96). The 
nivo + ipi + chemo group shows a mPFS 5.08 (95% CI 2.92, 8.81) months; the chemotherapy group 
shows a mOS 5.78 (95% CI 4.21, 7.13) months (Table 8). 
ORR 
The response rate for the nivo + ipi + chemo group is 27.0% (13.8, 44) and for the chemotherapy 
group 15.1% (5.1, 31.9). This results in a difference of 11% (-7.7, 30.0) favouring the 
nivo+ipi+chemo group (Table 12). 
Supportive study 
Study CA209227 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial of nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy (Part 1) and 
nivo+chemo vs chemotherapy (Part 2) in subjects with chemotherapy-naive stage IV or recurrent 
NSCLC with no known EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations, who were previously untreated for 
advanced disease. 
Study CA209227 has been previously assessed. Please also refer to: 
- ipilimumab (EMEA/H/C/002213/WS1372/0057)  
- nivolumab (EMEA/H/C/003985/WS1372/0053) 
Title study 
Study CA 209227 
An open label, randomised phase 3 trial of Nivolumab, or Nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or 
nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy versus platinum doublet chemotherapy in 
subjects with chemotherapy naive stage IV or recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) 
Study design 
An open label, randomised controlled, parallel, phase III trial. The study consisted of two parts: 1A and 
1B. The study was initially aimed to show the superiority of nivo+ ipi vs chemotherapy in patients with 
PD-L1 ≥1% (part 1A) and PD-L1 <1% (part 1B). The study was amended several times, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 108/157 
 
 
 
resulted in that the original part 1B disappeared and was displaced by another target population 
characterized by a TMB ≥ 10 mut /MB. However, the results of original part 1B will be presented in the 
current application. 
Main inclusion- and exclusion criteria  
Adult patients with ECOG PS ≤1 and histologically confirmed stage IV or recurrent NSCLC, with no 
prior systemic anticancer therapy (including EGFR and ALK inhibitors) given as primary therapy for 
advanced or metastatic disease. Patients must provide a tumour specimen for central PD-L1 IHC 
testing.  
Patient with central nervous system metastases or known EGFR mutations or ALK translocation were 
excluded  
Treatments 
-  Arm A: nivolumab 240 mg over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) (PD-L1≥1% only) 
- 
- 
Treatment arm B and G: nivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg over 
30 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W) 
Treatment C and F: histology-based platinum-doublet chemotherapy in 3-week cycles for a 
maximum of 4 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever came 
first).  
- 
Treatment arm G (PD-L1 <1% only): Nivolumab 360 mg over 30 minutes combined with 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) for a maximum of 4 
cycles. Subjects who have not experienced disease progression were to receive nivolumab 360 
mg Q3W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months (whichever 
comes first). 
The choices for the platinum doublet therapy were  
•  SQ: gemcitabine (1000 or 1250 mg/m2) with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC 5)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 109/157 
 
 
 
 
•  NSQ: pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6)  
For subjects with NSQ histology, pemetrexed maintenance was allowed until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. See the choices for platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy below. 
Results  
The study included a total of 1789 patients with a median age of 64.0 years. Most patients were white 
(75%) and male (69%). Most patients had an adenocarcinoma (69%) and were either current or 
former smokers (85%).  
Overall survival 
The median overall survival reported for nivo+ ipilimumab was 17.12 (95% CI 15.21, 19.94) months, 
compared to 13.86 (95% CI 12.16, 15.11) months with chemotherapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62, 0.86).  
The KM crossed at 3 months. The OS HR favoured chemotherapy for the first 3 month (HR 1.39, 95% 
CI 0.98, 1.97), after 3 months the OS HR favoured nivo + ipi over chemotherapy. The KM curves 
separated at approximately 7 months. (Figure 11) 
The observed improvement in OS is supported with improvement in the ORR and DoR, but not with 
PFS. (Table 17). 
Subgroup according to PD-L1 expression 
• 
PD-L1 ≥ 1% (part 1A of trial) 
For the PD-L1 ≥1% population, the survival showed an improvement of the nivo+ ipi combination 
therapy compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.79: 97.72% CI 0.65, 0.96). The median overall survival 
reported for nivo+ ipilimumab was 17.08 (95% CI 14.95, 20.07) months, compared to 14.88 (95% CI 
12.71, 16.72) months with chemotherapy.  
KM curves showed a crossing at 3 months. After 3 months the survival benefited the nivo+ ipi 
combination (Figure 12). 
The observed improvement in OS was supported with improvements in the ORR and DoR, but not with 
PFS (Table 17). 
• 
PD-L1 <1% (part 1B of trial) 
Nivo + ipi vs chemo 
In contrast to the PD-L1 ≥1% population, the PD-L1<1% showed an immediate survival benefit of the 
nivo+ ipi combination compared to chemotherapy. The median overall survival reported for nivo+ 
ipilimumab was 17.15 (95% CI 12.85, 22.05) months, compared to 12.19 (95% CI 9.17, 14.32) 
months with chemotherapy (0.62 97.5% CI 0.47, 0.81) (Figure 13). 
The observed improvement in OS was supported with improvement in PFS, ORR and DoR (Table 17). 
Nivo + chemo vs chemo 
This part of the trial included also a comparison arm of nivolumab + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy. 
The nivo+ chemotherapy showed an immediate survival advantage over chemotherapy (HR 0.78, 
97.5% CI 0.60, 1.02, p = 0.035) (Figure 13). 
The median OS of nivo + chemo was 15.21 (95% CI 12.19, 19.78) months, compared to 12.19 (9/17, 
14.32) months with chemo. The observed improvement in OS was supported with ORR and DOR, but 
not with PFS (Table 17).

The subgroup analyses according to histology showed that the nivo+ ipi treatment showed an 
improved OS compared to chemotherapy for both the SQ and the NSQ population. The largest benefit 
was observed in patients with squamous disease (Figure 14).

subjects.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With the current application the MAH applies for an extension of the indication of nivolumab+ 
ipilimumab + chemotherapy for treatment-naive stage IV or recurrent NSCLC: OPDIVO in combination 
with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment 
of metastatic non-small cell lung cancers in adults with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutation. 
The combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy combines two different treatment classes in the 
treatment of NSCLC. They both have a distinct mode of action, when combined may lead to an 
improved survival benefit, although an additive effect might be seen for the toxicity profile.  
Design and conduct of the trial  
The pivotal trial CA2099LA is not blinded. The open-label design might be accepted, because the 
blinding of the two-treatment arms would be severely hampered by the different treatment regimens 
and different associated toxicities of the traditional chemotherapy compared with immune 
chemotherapy treatment arm. The BMS clinical study team (with unblinding of a selected number to 
monitor safety) was blinded to the aggregate treatment group information up to database lock.  
Study population  
The study included patients with stage IV NSCLC. Patients with known sensitising EGFR mutations or 
ALK translocation or with CNS metastases were excluded. The exclusion of these patient groups is 
agreed. The patients with a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation are a distinct group of 
NSCLC which should be treated with targeted 1L and 2L therapies. Patients with known CNS 
metastases generally have a shortened life expectancy, which makes them unsuitable for participation 
in a clinical trial. Participants are eligible if CNS metastases are adequately treated and participants are 
neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS 
treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to first treatment. 
Endpoints  
The choice of OS as primary endpoint enables a clinical benefit evaluation based on relevant efficacy 
outcomes in cancer therapy, and it is therefore deemed adequate. The key secondary endpoints were 
PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, ORR per RECIST 1.1 and DOR. The key secondary endpoints are also 
adequate. 
Treatment allocation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 114/157 
 
 
 
 
 
The treatment allocation/randomisation was stratified according to PD-L1 expression, histology and 
gender. This approach is deemed adequate because PD-L1 expression and histology are distinct 
tumour characteristics with a different response to immunotherapy. Regarding gender, lung cancer 
may have a more favourable prognosis in females and as such, the stratification/randomisation 
strategy can be regarded as adequate.   
No stratification was made according to baseline platinum therapy (cisplatin vs. carboplatin) or 
smoking status. This is also considered adequate as cisplatin was only applied in the NSQ treated 
group and received by a limited number of patients (30%). The number of never smokers was small as 
anticipated. Both the baseline characteristics cisplatin/carboplatin and smoking history were evenly 
distributed over both treatment groups.  
A computer-generated randomisation schedule was used in the assignment of subjects to treatment 
groups in the study. This was transferred to the Interactive Response Technologies (IRT) vendor for 
use in an interactive web response system (IWRS) from which sites obtained a subject identification 
number and randomised/assigned a subject to a treatment arm. This is acceptable.  
Treatments 
-  Use of non-approved treatments 
The applied chemotherapies are in line with the recommendations made by the European Society for 
Medical Oncology11. However, in this trial, various treatments used are not approved in the EU: 
-  Nivolumab: fixed dose Q3W dose regimen 
-  Carboplatin dose combination with pemetrexed (source SmPC pemetrexed) 
-  Carboplatin dose combination with paclitaxel (source SmPC paclitaxel) 
The use of the fixed-dose combination of nivolumab (3qw) over the weight-based dosing (2wq) is 
justified because of the less frequent dosing, particularly if combined with chemotherapy. 
The use of the carboplatin combinations is justified because they are recommended by the European 
Society for Medical Oncology12. As such, these treatments can be regarded as well established. 
-  Number of chemotherapy cycles  
In the experimental arm, the number of chemotherapy cycles is limited to two. This limitation to two 
cycles is accepted because of the anticipated combined toxicity of the combination of immunotherapy 
and chemotherapy. 
Patients randomised to the comparator chemotherapy arm could receive up to 4 cycles of platinum-
based chemotherapy. Those patients who used pemetrexed could continue pemetrexed monotherapy if 
indicated. These treatment recommendations are adequate and in line with international guidelines. 
The limitation to 4 cycles of therapy is justified, as no OS benefit has been demonstrated for six versus 
fewer cycles of first-line platinum-based doublets, although a longer PFS was reported in patients 
receiving six cycles (Rossi A, Lancet Oncol 2014).  
Conduct of the trial  
As the study is open-label, the study might be more prone to bias. Concerns regarding the conduct of 
trial were raised in relation to GCP findings for study CA209227 that was performed in a similar target 
population and overlapping in time. The GCP inspection revealed a lack of solid Sponsor’s systems to

prevent dissemination of information to unauthorised/non authorised personnel within a non-robust 
and immature risk management system.  
The impact analyses provided revealed that study CA2099LA was conducted using improved systems 
and processes, i.e. in comparison to those used in study CA209227. In addition, a clinical quality self-
assessment (CQA) was conducted for Study CA2099LA, while continuing the implementation of the 
GCP inspection CAPAs resulting from study CA209227 inspection. At this time, about 95% of CAPA are 
implemented. 
The improved systems and processes, resulted in an enhanced data audit trail and transparency of the 
dataset traceability compared to study CA209227.  
These measures limited the access to data and improved the transparency of dataset traceability and 
audit trail. As such, the risk of dissemination of trial data was reduced.   
A specific concern was that select BMS staff members had access to unaggregated select safety data, 
including mortality data. The above-mentioned improved systems and procedures reduced the risk for 
preliminary clinical data to strategic members compared to study CA209227. Also, the preliminary 
dissemination of clinical trial data to strategic members is unlikely to occur because:  
o  No interim analysis was conducted prior to the one pre-planned (this statement is supported 
with the Unix Audit trail). The lack of such an interim analysis provides a lower risk of 
dissemination of trial data, which could lead to protocol amendments. 
o  BMS personnel reviewed the safety on a patient level. Only select safety listings with individual 
patient level treatment information were provided to select members to review safety toxicities 
according to protocol algorithms and allow query and data clarifications. This safety review is 
part of the Sponsor responsibility for a good conduct of the trial. 
o  A third party prepared the safety listing for the blinded DMC meetings. No data or results were 
communicated from the DMC to BMS.   
o  The MAH sufficiently substantiated that the amendments 02 (increasing of sample size) and 04 
(another statistical method for analyses) were based on external data: 
- 
There was very limited knowledge available for the efficacy of the combination of 
immunotherapy + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy when the study was initiated. No OS 
data was available. The data was limited to phase I data and limited phase II data 
obtained from the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy combination showing a superior PFS 
data of the combination vs chemotherapy.  
- 
The sample size was increased (amendment 02) when n=287 patients (66% of the total 
population) were randomised. Only OS data of n=35 patients was available and (n=19) 
6.6% and (n=106) 36.9% of subjects had >6 month and >3 month of follow-up, 
respectively.   
- 
At the end of 2018, when the enrolment of study CA2099LA was almost complete, more 
studies showed that the immuno-chemotherapy combination showed a delayed separation 
of the OS curves. The statistical analysis plan was adjusted (amendment 04) before 
database lock.  
o 
In addition, the supplemental requested analyses of study results before and after the 
implementation of amendment 02 (sample size) and amendment 04 aligned with the results 
before the implementation of the amendments.  
o  Updated study results (database lock 09-Mar-2020) confirm the primary efficacy results.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 116/157 
 
 
 
Based on all these above considerations, it is considered unlikely that efficacy data has been 
preliminary disseminated to the strategic decision makers of the trial. Also, the data management is 
deemed adequate. The updated OS data with more mature data also confirm the primary analyses. 
Overall, the trial data is regarded valid and can be used to support the requested marketing 
authorisation. 
Efficacy 
The results of this trial are based on a planned interim analysis when >322 events (80% of planned 
events) had occurred.  
The first patient included in Study CA2099LA was randomized on 03 Oct 2017. 
Deaths occurring after treatment discontinuation or completion were not captured as part of the ‘end-
of-treatment period subject status’ but were included in the overall survival summary for the primary 
analysis, i.e. total number of deaths among randomised subjects. This explains the discrepancies 
identified in the reported number of deaths. A total of 719 patients were randomised, 668 were 
reported with Stage IV and n=51 were reported as recurrent to metastatic disease of whom 31 were in 
the nivo+ipi+chemo arm (19 ‘recurrent to metastatic’ and 12 ‘recurrent’) and 20 were in the 
chemotherapy arm (17 ‘recurrent to metastatic’ and 3 ‘recurrent’).  
-  Patient characteristics 
The study included mainly patients with metastatic NSCLC (93%) and as such, is reflective for the 
proposed target population. The patient population with unspecified PD-L1 expression were included in 
the patient group with PD-L1 <1%. The patients with unspecified PD-L1 expression appear to be 
somewhat under-represented, as they included about 6.4% of the target population, while in study 
CA209277, up to 12% patients were included. However, it is expected that over time this group will be 
smaller, as techniques and experience improved for the quantification of PD-L1 expression. The 
median age was 66 years, which is in line with earlier studies in metastatic NSCLC, but somewhat 
younger than the mean age of patients with NSCLC (72 years).  
A total of ~ 7% of the patients had received (neo)adjuvant treatment before entering the study. It was 
confirmed that none of these 47 patients were reported to have received immunotherapy (e.g. 
durvalumab).  
In the NSQ group, a total of 70% of patients used the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed. 
This proportion appears to be high, considering that the ESMO recommends that this combination 
should only be used in patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin. Though, in a previous comparable 
application, also a similar high proportion of NSQ patients used carboplatin instead of cisplatin in 
combination with immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab - EMEA /H/C/003820/0043).  
The safety profile of carboplatin is characterised by bone marrow toxicity, while cisplatin and 
immunotherapy have overlapping renal side effects. Therefore, the combination of carboplatin + 
immunotherapy will be easier to monitor clinically than the combination of cisplatin + immunotherapy.  
The distribution of subsequent radiotherapy and surgery is overall comparable between treatment 
arms. More patients in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent systemic therapy. The most 
common second line treatment was immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has shown to improve the overall 
survival in second line NSCLC. Therefore, the reported OS for the chemotherapy arm might be larger 
than described historically, before the approval of second line immunotherapy 
-  Outcome measures

The study showed a clinically relevant improvement of the overall survival with nivo + ipi + chemo 
compared with chemotherapy alone. The KM curves showed an immediate improvement in overall 
survival, without a delayed treatment effect as would be observed for nivo + ipi alone. 
No crossing of curves occurred during the first months of treatment, although at 15 months the curves 
seem to touch, but interpretation is hampered by the large amount of censoring. Updated efficacy data 
were submitted confirming the separation of the curves. 
The overall benefit for the OS by nivo + ipi + chemo vs chemo is supported by the secondary outcome 
measures PFS, ORR, TTR and DoR. Besides, an overall treatment benefit was observed in almost all 
predefined subgroups favouring the combination treatment compared with chemotherapy, including 
the subgroups of patients according to gender, PD-L1 expression and baseline histology (i.e. the 
stratification factors). These data support the robustness of the observed survival benefit.  
However, the outcomes for overall survival favoured chemotherapy in the subgroups of patients who 
were never smokers, patients ≥ 75 years and unquantifiable PD-L1 expression. Indeed, the elderly and 
non-smokers showed in previous studies also a smaller effect of immunotherapy.  
The current results in the subgroup of patients with unquantifiable PD-L1 expression are hard to 
interpret, as the patient group with unquantifiable PD-L1 expression is small (n=46). 
Supportive studies  
The results of the pivotal phase III CA2099LA comparative trial are supported by two other trials: 
•  CA209568 (A Study of Nivolumab in Combination with Ipilimumab (Part 1); And Nivolumab Plus 
Ipilimumab In Combination With Chemotherapy (Part 2) As First Line Therapy In Stage IV Non-
Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)): a single-arm phase II study conducted in n=36 showing an 
improved PFS of nivo+ipi + chemo compared to nivo+ ipi alone.   
•  CA209227 (An Open-Label, Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Nivolumab, or Nivolumab plus 
Ipilimumab, or Nivolumab plus Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy versus Platinum Doublet 
Chemotherapy in Subjects with Chemotherapy-Naïve Stage IV or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer (NSCLC)): a large phase III trial comparing nivo + ipi vs. platinum-based chemotherapy in 
the same target population. However, several issues related to study conduct and methodology 
were identified (as discussed above). The MAH withdrew the application before opinion by the 
CHMP (EMEA/H/C/WS1372). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the Interim Analysis of the pivotal study CA2099LA showed a clinically relevant 
improvement in overall survival for nivo+ ipi+ chemo compared to chemotherapy as first-line 
treatment of metastatic NSCLC in patients without a sensitising EGFR mutation and who do not 
harbour an ALK translocation. The effect in overall survival is supported by the secondary outcome 
measures and in several predefined subgroups. These supportive outcomes show the robustness of the 
overall survival results. The updated efficacy data submitted during the procedure (09-Mar-2020 
database lock; minimum duration of follow-up for OS of 12.7 months) confirm the initially reported 
efficacy results.    
The data is limited for patients ≥ 75 years for whom the nivolumab + ipilimumab+ chemotherapy 
combination should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk based 
on an individual basis (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Concerns were raised regarding the conduct of this open-label trial. Some BMS personnel were 
unblinded to individual patienttreatment information for the purpose of safety review and data review

and cleaning before database lock and it was unknown whether and which preventive measures had 
been taken to prevent the dissemination of critical data to the clinical and strategic decision-makers, 
especially as the Sponsor’s system to protect against information dissemination was shown to be weak 
in a GCP inspection of study CA209227, and how this may have impacted the (quality of the) study 
results. Evidence was however provided by the MAH to support that study CA2099LA was conducted 
using improved systems and processes in comparison to those used in study CA209227. This allowed 
for the conclusion that even if there is an overlap in the timing of conduct with study CA209227, for 
which major GCP findings were reported, these do not impact the results of study CA2099LA. A clinical 
quality self-assessment (CQA) was conducted for study CA2099LA, while continuing the 
implementation of the GCP inspection CAPAs resulting from study CA209227 inspection. Based on the 
justifications/data provided it can be concluded that the integrity of study CA2099LA is not in question 
and the reported data can overall be considered reliable for benefit/risk assessment. 
Additional supportive efficacy data has been provided from two additional trials (phase II CA209568 
and phase III CA209227) where an improved PFS of nivo+ipi + chemo compared to nivo+ ipi alone 
and an overall improvement in OS of nivo + ipi vs. platinum-based chemotherapy were shown, 
respectively. 
The wording of the indication has been refined to adequately reflect the included study population, i.e.: 
OPDIVO: 
“Opdivo in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no 
sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation”. 
Yervoy: 
“YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no 
sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation” 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In this application, the immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy. The main safety set for 
nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy (nivo+ipi+chemo) as first line treatment in NSCLC is based on 
358 subjects from CA2099LA and 36 subjects from CA209568 Part 2 (chemotherapy is based on 349 
subjects from CA2099LA). There was no pooling of safety data from CA2099LA and CA209568 Part 2 
due to limited sample size in CA209568 Part 2. In study CA2099LA and CA209568, nivo+ipi+chemo 
treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or up to 24 months.  
Since chemotherapy is administered Q3W, a nivolumab 360 mg flat dose Q3W was chosen for study 
CA209568 part 2. Nivolumab 360 mg Q3W has similar steady-state average exposures relative to the 
3 mg/kg Q2W dose (at a median body weight of ~ 80 kg). Based on the safety results of CA209568 
part 2 the dose of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy Q3W was chosen for further development.

Pivotal Safety Data – study CA2099LA 
Patient exposure 
At the time of the database lock of 03 Oct 2019, all patients are randomised (n=719) and have 
minimum follow up of 8.1 months for OS.  
The proportion of subjects who received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity was as follows  
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 79.1% for nivolumab, 85.2% for ipilimumab, 78.4% for cisplatin, 72.1% 
for carboplatin, 70.7% for paclitaxel, and 78.7% for pemetrexed ((Table 18) 
•  Chemotherapy arm: 81.3% for cisplatin, 75.7% for carboplatin, 70.3% for paclitaxel, and 
73.2% for pemetrexed (Table 19) 
The median (95% CI) duration of therapy was 6.05 (4.93, 7.06) months for the nivo+ipi+chemo arm 
and 2.43 (2.30, 2.83) months in the chemotherapy arm. 
The median number of doses received was as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 9 doses for nivolumab, 4 doses for ipilimumab, and 2 doses for each of 
cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pemetrexed 
•  Chemotherapy arm: 4 doses for each of cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, and 6 doses for 
pemetrexed. 
In the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, most treated subjects (93.0%) received 2 cycles of chemotherapy.  
Per protocol, chemotherapy was to be given for 4 cycles (12 weeks) to subjects in the chemotherapy 
arm, followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy in patients with NSQ histology.

Table 20 Number of chemotherapy cycles- all treated patients  
The overall rates of discontinuation during the treatment period were 66.2% and 58.2% in the 
nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy arm, respectively.  
The primary reason for not completing the treatment period was disease progression (292 subjects, 
41.3%): 150 (41.9%) nivo+ipi+chemo treated subjects and 142 (40.7%) chemotherapy-treated 
subjects (see also Figure 4).  
In the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, 18 (5.0%) of the 358 treated subjects discontinued ipilimumab early. 
Note that ipilimumab could be discontinued and nivolumab continued; however, if nivolumab was 
discontinued, ipilimumab could not be continued alone as monotherapy. After ipilimumab was stopped 
in 18 subjects, the median number of nivolumab doses received was 3 (range: 1 - 13) and the median 
duration of treatment was 91 days (range: 20 - 304). Subjects who discontinued study therapy due to 
AEs are further described below. 
Most treated subjects received all doses of study medication without infusion interruption or rate 
reduction; however, dose delays were common in both arms.  
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose delay) were reported as 
follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 55.9% for nivolumab, 48.0% for ipilimumab, 13.5% for cisplatin, 16.2% 
for carboplatin, 17.2% for paclitaxel, and 14.8% for pemetrexed  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020

•  Chemotherapy arm: 26.7% for cisplatin, 29.3% for carboplatin, 33.3% for paclitaxel, and 
47.3% for pemetrexed  
Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab or ipilimumab treatment, but they were 
permitted with chemotherapy. Dose reductions of chemotherapy (proportion of subjects with at least 1 
dose reduction) were reported: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 10.8% for cisplatin, 25.4% for carboplatin, 16.4% for paclitaxel, and 
9.0% for pemetrexed. 
•  Chemotherapy arm: 12.0% for cisplatin, 27.9% for carboplatin, 22.5% for paclitaxel, and 
16.3% for pemetrexed. 
AE related to dose delay or dose reduction 
In both arms, the most common cause of dose delay for nivolumab, ipilimumab, and chemotherapy 
was an adverse event. The most frequently reported (≥ 2.5%) all causality AEs of any grade leading to 
dose delay or reduction were: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: anaemia (7.3%), neutropenia (4.7%), diarrhoea (4.5%), pneumonitis 
(3.1%), asthenia (3.1%), rash (2.5%) and ALT increased (2.5%). 
•  Chemotherapy arm: anaemia (13.5%), neutropenia (10.3%), thrombocytopenia (4.9%), 
platelet count decreased (2.9%), and asthenia (2.6%). 
The most frequently reported (≥ 2%) drug-related AEs of any grade leading to dose delay or reduction 
were: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo arm: anaemia (4.7%), neutropenia (4.7%), diarrhoea (3.6%), pneumonitis 
(2.8%), and ALT increased (2.5%). 
•  Chemotherapy arm: anaemia (12.0%), neutropenia (9.5%), thrombocytopenia (4.6%), 
platelet count decreased (2.9%), and neutrophil count decreased (2.3%).

Infusion interruptions occurred during nivolumab administration in 21 subjects (5.9%) and 
ipilimumab administration in 3 subjects (0.8%). In both arms, for the chemotherapy treatment, 
infusion interruptions occurred most frequently during paclitaxel administration (nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 
9 subjects, 7.8%; chemo arm, 7 subjects, 6.3%). 
Infusion rate reductions occurred during nivolumab administration in 10 subjects (2.8%) and during 
ipilimumab administration in 4 subjects (1.1%). In the chemotherapy arm, infusion rate reductions

occurred most frequently during paclitaxel administration (nivo+ipi+chemo arm: 2 subjects, 1.7%; 
chemo arm, 6 subjects, 5.4%). 
Adverse events 
The overall frequencies of any-grade AEs and drug-related AEs were similar between the 
nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy arms; however, the overall frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs and 
drug-related AEs were higher with nivo+ipi+chemo compared with chemotherapy (Table 23). 
Consistent with the limited cycles of chemotherapy, several toxicities typically related to chemotherapy 
were less frequently reported with nivo+ipi+chemo relative to chemo (Table 24)

The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (≥2%) were: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: neutropenia (6.1%), anaemia (5.6%), diarrhoea (3.9%), and lipase 
increased (3.6%). 
•  Chemotherapy: anaemia (13.8%), neutropenia (8.9%), asthenia (2.3%), and 
thrombocytopenia (2.3%). 
When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, drug-related AE incidence rates (per 100 person years) 
were 866.6 with nivo+ipi+chemo treatment and 1013.2 with chemotherapy treatment (Table 26). 
Table 26 Exposure-adjusted Adverse Events Rates 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall frequencies of SAEs (all causality, drug-related, Grade 3-4) were higher with 
nivo+ipi+chemo than with chemotherapy alone (Table 23 and Table 27).

A higher frequency of all causality SAEs with nivo+ipi+chemo relative to chemotherapy alone were 
reported in all SOCs (except for blood and lymphatic systems disorders, refer to Table 27) 
A higher frequency of drug-related SAEs with nivo+ipi+chemo relative to chemotherapy alone were 
reported in the following SOCs (GI disorders (7.3% vs 2.6%), endocrine disorders (3.1% vs 0%), and 
hepatobiliary disorders (2.5% vs 0%)) (Table 27) 
Table 27 Serious Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 2% of All Treated Subjects 
Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 104 (29.1%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, 
and 61 (17.5%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported in 
90 (25.1%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 51 (14.6%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm 
(Table 23). 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: diarrhea (3.1%), febrile neutropenia (3.1%), anemia (2.2%), acute kidney 
injury (1.7%), colitis (1.4%), and adrenal insufficiency (1.4%) 
•  Chemotherapy: anaemia (3.4%), febrile neutropenia (2.6%), thrombocytopenia (1.7%), and 
pancytopenia (1.4%) 
Death 
As of the 03-Oct-2019 database lock, 42.7% subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 54.7% of 
subjects in the chemotherapy arm died (Table 28).  
Table 28: Death Summary - All Treated Subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 129/157 
 
 
 
 
 
Of these deaths, a total of 13 were considered due to study drug toxicity. 
•  7 subjects (2.0%) in the nivo+ipi+chemo group died due to acute kidney injury (chemo), 
thrombocytopenia (chemo), pneumonitis (nivo+ipi), hepatic toxicity (nivo+ipi+chemo), 
hepatitis (nivo+ipi), diarrhoea (ipi) and sepsis (ipi+chemo).  
•  6 subjects (1.7%) in the chemotherapy group due to sepsis, anaemia, pancytopenia, 
respiratory failure, pulmonary sepsis and febrile neutropenia. 
Death attributed to other reasons occurred in 17 subjects (4.7%) and 17 subjects (4.9%) in the nivo 
+ipi+chemo arm and chemotherapy arm, respectively.  
Select adverse events 
Select AEs are AEs of special clinical interest that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab and nivolumab. Adverse events including endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event 
terms that may describe each of these were grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, 
pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE categories, respectively. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were 
analysed along with the select AE categories. 
Most of select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator.

respectively (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Across the select AE categories, most events in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm were manageable using the 
established algorithms, with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mainly 
systemic corticosteroids) were administered (Table 30).  
Some endocrine select AEs, though well controlled with hormone replacement therapy, were not 
considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Other events of special interest (OESIs) (regardless of causality or immune-modulating medication 
[IMM] treatment) include the following categories: Pancreatitis, Encephalitis, Myositis, Myasthenic 
Syndrome, Demyelination, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Uveitis, Myocarditis, Rhabdomyolysis, Graft 
versus Host Disease.  
OESIs were infrequent in both treatment arms. Overall, OESIs were reported in 7/358 (2.0%) subjects 
in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 1/349 (0.3%) subject in the chemotherapy arm:  
•  OESIs in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm were: pancreatitis (5 subjects, 4 drug-related, 4 resolved 
with IMM treatment) and encephalitis (2 subjects, 1 drug-related, 1 resolved with IMM 
treatment).

•  OESI in the chemotherapy arm was: Myositis (1 subject, unrelated, resolved without 
treatment)  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory measurements were recorded regardless of causality and some were correlated with 
reported laboratory-based AEs. 
Laboratory results reported after first dose and within 30 days of last dose of study therapy are 
presented in the sections below for all subjects treated with nivo+ipi+chemo or chemotherapy in 
CA2099LA. 
Haematology  
Abnormalities in hematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2.  
On-treatment worsening of haematology parameters to Grade 3-4 was generally similar between 
nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy (Table 31).

Baseline (SI Units) - Treated Subjects - CA2099LA 
Liver test 
During the treatment period, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 
1-2. A total of 3/346 (0.9%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and no subjects in the chemotherapy 
arm had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 
1 day and within 30 days based on laboratory results reported after the first dose and within 30 days 
of last dose of study therapy 
The majority of subjects did not have liver function tests that worsened relative to baseline. The 
following hepatic abnormalities worsened to Grade 3-4 relative to baseline in ≥ 1% of subjects. 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: increased ALT (4.3%), increased AST (3.5%), and increased alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) (1.2%).

•  Chemotherapy: increased ALT (1.2%). 
Kidney test  
Most subjects with at least 1 on-treatment measurement had normal creatinine values during the 
treatment reporting period. 
The abnormalities in creatinine (increase) were primarily reported as Grade 1 or 2. 4 subjects in the 
nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 2 subjects in the chemotherapy arm had a Grade 3-4 increased creatinine 
level. 
The majority of subjects did not have creatinine that worsened relative to baseline. The proportions of 
subjects with creatinine level worsening to Grade 3-4 relative to baseline were 1.2% and 0.6% in the 
nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy arms, respectively. 
Thyroid function test

Safety in special populations 
The frequencies of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-level Group 
Term (HLGT)/SMQs/SOC by age group are presented in Table 34 for nivo+ipi+chemo and 
chemotherapy treated subjects. 
The frequencies for subgroups of age < 65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years were similar to the 
frequencies reported for the overall study population by treatment, with a few exceptions: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: 
o  Numerically higher frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years 
of age subgroup vs the overall population for SAEs with fatal (death) outcome (29.7% 
vs 12.8%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (43.2% vs 27.9%). 
o  Numerically lower frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years 
of age subgroup vs the overall population for psychiatric disorders (2.7% vs 16.5%), 
nervous system disorders (16.2% vs 33.5%), and anticholinergic syndrome (18.9% vs 
31.0%). 
•  Chemotherapy: 
o  A numerically higher frequency (≥10% difference) was reported in the 75 to 84 years 
of age subgroup vs the overall population for SAEs with fatal (death) outcome (26.7% 
vs 14.3%). A similar increase in SAEs with fatal (death) outcome in subjects 75 to 84 
years of age over the overall population was observed, regardless of treatment.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation included events where 1 or more drugs of a multidrug regimen were 
discontinued, even if the subject remained on treatment. The overall frequencies of all causality AEs 
leading to discontinuation were higher in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm relative to the chemotherapy arm 
(Table 23). 
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 100 
(27.9%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 59 (16.9%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. 
Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 77 (21.5%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo 
arm and 38 (10.9%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: malignant neoplasm progression (3.6%), diarrhoea (2.5%), pneumonitis 
(2.0%), and colitis (1.4%) 
•  Chemotherapy: malignant neoplasm progression (3.4%), general physical health deterioration 
(1.4%), and anaemia (1.1%) 
Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 68 (19.0%) subjects in 
the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 26 (7.4%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 54 (15.1%) subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 14 (4.0%) 
subjects in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most common drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi+chemo: diarrhoea (2.5%), pneumonitis (2.0%), colitis (1.4%), hepatotoxicity 
(0.8%), adrenal insufficiency (0.8%), acute kidney injury (0.8%), and ALT increased (0.8%) 
•  Chemotherapy: anaemia (0.9%) 
Immunogenicity 
Of the 308 nivolumab ADA evaluable subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, 19 (6.2%) subjects were 
nivolumab ADA positive at baseline and 104 (33.8%) subjects were nivolumab ADA positive after the 
start of treatment (Table 35). 
Of the 305 ipilimumab ADA evaluable subjects in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm, 9 (3.0%) subjects were 
ipilimumab ADA positive at baseline and 23 (7.5%) subjects were ipilimumab ADA positive after the 
start of treatment (Table 35).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety set for nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy (nivo+ipi+chemo) in the first line 
treatment in NSCLC is provided by study CA2099LA. Additional supportive data is provided by the 
n=36 patients from the single-arm phase II study CA209568. In general, study CA209568 Part 2 
shows a similar profile for nivo+ipi+chemo as seen in study CA2099LA. These extra data are limited, 
and therefore no pooling occurred. In both studies, the immuno-chemotherapy combination was 
continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or up to 24 months. 
Study CA2099LA provides a comparative analysis of the combination immuno-chemotherapy (n=358) 
vs chemotherapy (n=349). The provided safety data is considered numerically appropriate for safety 
evaluation, also in consideration that the safety profile of nivo+ ipilimumab is described in various 
applications including second-line metastatic NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/3985/II/0001) and 1L metastatic 
NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/WS1372). 
In study CA209227, most patients (≥70%) received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity. The 
proportion of subjects who received at least two cycles of chemotherapy in the chemotherapy arm was 
similar to the proportion of patients who received the maximum two cycles of chemotherapy in the 
combination treatment arm (93.4% vs. 93%) so that differences in the safety profile for the 
combination, particularly in relation to AEs reported during the first two first cycles of chemotherapy, is 
attributable to the addition of nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
The nivo+ipi+chemo group showed a higher median treatment duration (6.05 (95% CI 4.93, 7.06) 
months) compared with the chemotherapy group (2.43 (2.50, 2.83) months). As such, adverse 
events/ SAE / AEs leading to discontinuation might be higher in the nivo+ipi+ chemo group. However, 
this more prolonged treatment is required to obtain the observed improvement in overall survival 
compared to chemotherapy. Therefore, the use of exposure-related adverse incidence rates will be of 
limited value and the overall, unadjusted data has to be taken into account. 
Both treatment arms showed dose delays and dose reductions. Dose reductions were only allowed for 
the chemotherapy. Overall, 117 (32.7%) subjects from the nivo+ipi+chemo arm and 150 (43%) 
subjects from the chemo arm received treatment without any dose delay or dose reduction (if 
permitted). As expected this percentage is higher in the chemotherapy arm due to the 
increased/different toxicity profile of the combination treatment. The nivo+ ipi+ chemo group showed 
a lower number of dose delays and dose reductions for chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy 
group. This reduction is most likely due to the reduced amount of cycles (n=2 vs n=4) but also due to 
the reduction of cumulative toxicity when less cycles of chemotherapy are used (nivo+ipi +chemo: 2 
cycles, chemo 4 cycles).  
Both treatments showed a high, similar amount of AE (> 97%). The reported number of toxic deaths 
(2% vs 1.7%) was also comparable.  
However, the reported toxicity profile differed. The safety profile of the chemotherapy arm was 
characterised by the bone marrow suppression, while the safety profile of the combination therapy was 
characterised by the combination of bone marrow suppression and immune related adverse events.   
Consistent with the more limited cycles of chemotherapy, several toxicities typically related to 
chemotherapy (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) were less frequently reported with 
nivo+ipi+chemo compared with chemo (Table 24). However, select immune-related adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 140/157 
 
 
 
occurred more frequently in the nivo+ ipi+ chemotherapy group (Table 23). These observations show 
that the toxic profile of the treatments differ.  
The nivo+ipi+chemo groups showed a higher frequency of Grade 3-4 AEs to the chemotherapy arm 
(63.7% vs 52.7%, respectively). The most frequently reported grade 3-4 AEs (≥3%) were mainly 
chemotherapy-related AEs in both treatment arms. nivo+ipi+chemo: neutropenia (6.1%), anaemia 
(5.6%); chemotherapy: anaemia (13.8%), neutropenia (8.9%). These observations suggest that 
immunotherapy related grade 3-4 AEs are more diverse compared with chemotherapy and therefore 
do not pop-up as the most frequently detected. It shows that the adverse event profile in the immune-
chemotherapy group is more diverse than in the chemotherapy group.  
Most patients discontinued treatment because of disease progression, with similar rates in both 
treatment arms (±40% both groups). However, more patients in the nivo+ipi+chemotherapy arm 
discontinued because of AEs compared with the chemotherapy arm (27.9% vs 16%). Also, the type of 
AEs leading to discontinuation differed between the two treatment arms. In the triple therapy arm, 
these events appeared to be immune-related (diarrhoea, pneumonitis, colitis) while in the 
chemotherapy arm, the reported events were general health deterioration and anaemia. These 
observations show again that the toxic profile differs between the two treatment regimens. The overall 
higher rate of discontinuation due to adverse events suggest that the nivo + ipi +chemotherapy is less 
well tolerated compared to chemotherapy despite the lower cycles of chemotherapy provided.  
The presence of nivolumab or ipilimumab ADA did not appear to be associated with the occurrence of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs. 
As expected, the nivo+ipi + chemo group reported a higher number of immune-related and other-
events of specific interest compared to chemotherapy. The number of these events were generally in 
line with the nivo+ipi therapy reported in study CA 209227, including the number of resolved select 
adverse events. However, cross-study comparisons may show a higher number of unresolved select 
renal adverse events. 
The cross-study comparison with study CA209227 show that frequency of reported select renal events 
is comparable between nivo+ipi +chemo (n=37 (10.3%) vs nivo+ ipi (n=56 9.7%) or nivo+ chemo 
(n=22, 12.8%)). The frequency of resolved AEs (56%) is lower with nivo+ipi+ chemo compared to 
nivo+ ipi (90%) or with nivo + chemo (86) though this percentage did increase with longer follow-up. 
Although the numbers are low, this raises concerns about the added renal toxicity when nivo+ ipi is 
added to chemotherapy.  
The use of chemotherapy is associated with renal impairment. Cisplatin has more renal side effects 
than carboplatin which likely explains why more than 60% of patients with NSQ histology received 
carboplatin as part of their chemo regimen in both arms.  Further data provided show that the 
proportions of subjects with renal select AEs (all and drug related) were similar across the treatment 
arms (nivo+ipi+chemo and chemotherapy arms), both in subjects treated with cisplatin and in 
subjects treated with carboplatin, but the numbers are too low to be conclusive.  
Previous studies also showed added renal side effects when pembrolizumab was added to 
chemotherapy EMEA/H/C/003820/0043), but also in that case the number was too low to be 
conclusive. 
Except for these unresolved select renal side effects, the provided data does not suggest that the 
addition of chemotherapy to the nivo+ ipi combination will induce new immune-related adverse 
events. No new indication specific, immune-mediated adverse event caused by nivolumab + 
ipilimumab was found.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 141/157 
 
 
 
In general, study CA209568 Part 2 shows a similar profile for nivo+ipi+chemo as seen in study 
CA2099LA. The frequency is slightly lower, but this is likely caused by the low sample size of only 36 
subjects. 
Safety in the Elderly 
The overall safety profile indicates that more SAEs were experienced with nivo+ipi+chemo compared 
to chemotherapy, regardless of age. However, the number of patients aged ≥ 75 years that 
discontinued treatment in nivo+ ipi + chemo group is worrisome. Although the number of included 
patients is low, the number of patients aged ≥ 75 years that discontinued treatment is high (16/37 = 
43.2%) and differs considerably compared to 5/33 (17%) in the chemotherapy arm. This difference in 
discontinuation is troublesome and it may provide a rationale for why in elderly patients, no OS benefit 
is shown with the nivo+ipi+chemo combination compared to chemotherapy. Information about the 
safety in this population, which represents a significant part of the proposed target population, is 
included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profiles of nivo+ipi+chemo in CA2099LA were reflective of the known safety profile of the 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy components in first-line NSCLC. No new safety signals or toxicities 
were identified with nivo+ipi+chemo, relative to each agent as monotherapy or the nivo+ipi 
combination. Also, no new safety signals or toxicities were identified relative to previous experience 
with each monotherapy, or the nivolumab + ipilimumab regimen in prior melanoma studies and renal 
cell carcinoma studies. 
The nivo + ipi + chemo treatment appears to be less well tolerated compared to chemotherapy as 
shown by the higher number of (drug-related) AEs and SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. This 
lesser tolerance is mainly due to the fact that the toxic safety profile of the nivo+ipi + chemo group is 
characterised by a combination of the immunologically induced adverse events and bone marrow 
suppression. In contrast, the toxic safety profile of the chemotherapy group is limited to bone marrow 
suppression.  
The combination of nivo+ipi+ chemo may have an added negative effect on renal adverse events 
compared with the combination of nivo+ipi alone, but the reported numbers are too low to be 
conclusive.  
The combination treatment appears less well tolerated in patients aged ≥75 years, but the provided 
data is limited. Of concern is the high discontinuation rate (about 43%) in that population. The 
combination therapy should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential 
benefit/risk on an individual basis (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
The new indication that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of administration and has a 
similar safety profile as the previously approved indications. 
-  Administration is done by a health care professional. The instructions for dose calculation, 
preparation, administration, storage and disposal that are currently reflected in the approved PL 
remain unchanged. 
- 
- 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed. 
The modifications now proposed in the PL do not represent major changes. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles 
of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancers in adults whose tumours have no sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases diagnosed yearly. 
NSCLC is mainly diagnosed at an advanced stage with overall poor prognosis. The overall survival (OS) 
for metastatic NSCLC is dismal with a 5-year survival of <5%, although recently approved 
immunotherapy has improved survival. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At the time of study initiation (May 2017), the standard of care therapy for metastatic treatment-naive 
NSCLC without driver mutations included histology-based platinum-doublet chemotherapy. 
Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 monotherapy, had recently received a positive opinion for first-line 
NSCLC with patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥ 50%) (27 Jan 2017; EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0011). 
However, this therapy was not generally established in clinical practice yet.  
During the conduct of the trial, two immunotherapy (pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) + platinum-
based chemotherapy combinations were approved for the treatment for the 1L NSCLC. These products 
showed an improvement in overall survival when the immunotherapy was added to chemotherapy 
(EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0043 and EMEA/H/C/004143/II/0019).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on the results of the first planned interim analyses and updated 
efficacy data (with additional follow-up for OS) submitted during the procedure of the phase III study 
CA2099LA. Study CA2099LA is an international, randomised, open-label, parallel study comparing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/603938/2020  
Page 151/157 
 
 
 
nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy with chemotherapy in the first line treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The combination therapy of nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy (nivo+ipi+chemo) showed an 
improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.69, 96.71% CI 0.55, 0.87), p=0.0006. 
Nivo+ipi+chemo median OS: 14.13 months (95% CI 13.24, 16.16), chemotherapy median OS 10.74 
months (95% CI 9.46, 12.45). 
The Kaplan–Meier curves show an almost immediate separation of the curves for overall survival.  
These results are supported with all secondary outcome measures like improvement in PFS, ORR and 
DoR favouring the nivolumab+ ipilimumab+ chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy. 
These beneficial effects favouring the nivo+ipi+chemo groups are overall consistent across the 
predefined subgroups. 
Updated efficacy data submitted during the procedure confirm the initially reported clinical benefit. 
With an additional 4.6 months of follow-up (09-Mar-2020 database lock; minimum duration of follow-
up for OS of 12.7 months), the median OS (95% CI) increased to 15.64 months (13.93, 19.98) in the 
nivo+ipi+chemo arm and remained relatively unchanged in the chemotherapy arm: 10.91 months 
(9.46, 12.55). The results for median PFS and other secondary outcome measures also matured and 
overall slightly improved in the nivo+ipi+chemo arm while remained unchanged in the chemotherapy 
arm.  
The number of drug related death is similar between the two treatment groups (nivo+ipi+chemo 2%, 
chemo 1.7%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The subgroup of patients aged ≥ 75 years is small (n=70). Although the nivo + ipi + chemo group 
show a better ORR compared to chemotherapy (11.9% (95% CI -7.7, 30.0), the nivo+ ipi + chemo 
combination shows a decreased overall survival (HR 1.36 (95% CI 0.74, 2.52) and reduction in PFS 
(HR 1.12 (95% CI 0.61, 1.96) in this population. Information in this respect is included in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of the nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy combination is characterised by the 
combination of immunological adverse events and bone marrow suppression. This leads to a more 
variable adverse events profile compared to chemotherapy alone.  
The number of Grade 3-4 AE are higher in the nivo+ipi+chemo therapy group compared with the 
chemotherapy group (all causality grade 3-4 (43.9% vs 31.8 %), drug related grade 3-4 (25.1% vs 
14.6%). 
The frequency of all-causality and drug related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation are 
higher with nivo+ipi+chemo vs chemotherapy (all causality (27.9% vs 16.9%); drug related (19.0% 
vs 7.4%). 
As expected, select AEs, immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs), and other events of special 
interest (OESIs) occurred more frequently with nivo+ipi+chemo relative to chemotherapy.

The age group ≥ 75 years treated with nivo+ipi + chemotherapy showed a higher number of AEs 
leading to discontinuation than in the younger age groups (43% vs 27%) and compared with the same 
age group treated with chemotherapy (43.2% vs 16.7%).  
Although cross-study comparison with study CA 209227 show the same frequency of renal select 
adverse event (9.7%) for nivo+ipi+ chemo vs nivo + ipi, the reported frequency of resolved renal AE 
is lower with nivo+ipi + chemo (56%) vs nivo + ipi (90%). This percentage increased with longer 
follow-up. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median age in NSCLC is 71 years, while the median age in the investigated population is younger 
(64 years). This might indicate that the safety profile in clinical practice might be worse compared with 
the safety profile presented in the clinical study report, but the included number of patients is too 
small to be conclusive. 
The number of patients with select renal adverse event is too small to conclude that the immune-
chemotherapy combination leads to more unresolved select renal adverse event compared to the 
combination of nivolumab+ ipilimumab alone.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with metastatic NSCLC have a dismal prognosis despite treatment with chemotherapy. 
Additional treatments are needed to improve the overall survival. The combination of two different

classes of treatments (immuno therapy + chemotherapy) showed an improved survival, but it was also 
associated with more side effects.  
In study CA2099LA, the addition of nivo+ipi to two platinum-based chemotherapy cycles was 
compared to four cycles of chemotherapy. The immuno-chemotherapy arm showed a clinically relevant 
improvement in OS > 3 months (HR 0.69, 96.71% CI 0.55, 0.87, p = 0.0006) compared with 
chemotherapy, with an almost immediate separation of the KM curves for overall survival. The overall 
survival was supported with improvements in the secondary outcome measures like the PFS, ORR, 
DOR and almost all predefined subgroups. This support for the OS shows the robustness of the 
observed improvement in OS. Additional updated efficacy results (with additional 4.6 months of follow-
up for OS) confirm the initially reported efficacy results and with the curves remaining separated over 
time.  
The overall safety profile of the immune-chemotherapy combination is characterised by the 
combination of immunological adverse events and bone marrow suppression. The combination of these 
side effects resulted in that more patients reported AEs grade 3-4, and that more patients discontinued 
treatment because of AE in the nivo+ipi+chemo group compared with chemotherapy. These 
observations indicate that the immune-chemotherapy treatment appeared to be less well tolerated 
compared to chemotherapy alone. However, despite the higher percentage of early discontinuation, 
still a clinically relevant improvement in OS is observed compared to chemotherapy.  
This lower tolerability is of concern for patients aged ≥ 75 years. Although the included number is 
limited (n=70), the reported efficacy and safety raise concern about the B/R profile in this critical 
target population in the treatment of NSCLC cancer with a median age of 71 years. In the subgroup of 
patients aged ≥ 75 years, a high proportion of patients (43%) discontinued treatment. The high 
discontinuation rate may provide a rationale why the point estimate for the OS HR in elderly patients is 
close to 1 when the nivo+ipi+chemo combination is compared to chemotherapy. This information is 
reflected in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
During the conduct of the trial, members of the BMS team had access to the unblinded select safety 
toxicity data (including mortality data) for individual patients before database lock, and the open label 
study had several important protocol revisions. It was unknown whether and which preventive 
measures had been taken to avoid the dissemination of data to clinical and strategic decision makers 
for trial CA2099LA and whether there was an impact of the GCP findings related to study CA209227 
(O/Y in 1L NSCLC) on the quality of the CA2099LA study results. The requested impact analyses of 
previous GCP findings related to study CA209227 revealed that study CA2099LA was conducted using 
improved systems and processes, while most CAPAs were implemented. These improved systems and 
processed limited the number of persons with access to the data based and resulted in improved 
dataset traceability and audit trail. In addition, it was sufficiently justified that the protocol 
amendments were based on external data. More importantly, the results of the requested 
supplemental analyses on the data before and after the implementation of the two main amendments 
of the study were aligned (e.g. HRs for OS in initially enrolled patients vs. those recruited following the 
revision of the sample size are consistent confirming that the results were not driven by the latter 
group). Further, updated study results (database lock 09-Mar-2020) confirmed the primary efficacy 
results. Based on these considerations, it can be concluded that the integrity of study CA2099LA is not 
questioned and the reported data can overall be considered reliable and used for benefit/risk 
assessment. 
Finally, the wording of the indication has been refined to reflect the included study population, i.e.: 
OPDIVO:

“OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no 
sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation”. 
Yervoy: 
“YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no 
sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation” 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The trial shows a robust and clinically relevant improvement in overall survival that has been 
confirmed with updated efficacy data submitted (longer follow-up). It is considered that this OS benefit 
outweighs the observation that treatment appears to be less well tolerated compared to 
chemotherapy. The benefit/risk ratio is considered positive.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk ratio of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W in combination 
with 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is considered positive in the intended indication.

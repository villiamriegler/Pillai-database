2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Giant cell tumour of the bone (GCTB) is a rare tumour with an incidence of about 800, 800, 80, and 30 cases 
are newly diagnosed yearly in the United States (US), European Union (EU), Canada, and Australia, 
respectively. Diagnosis is made at a mean age of about 33 years with the bulk of patients between 15 and 
55 years although younger and elderly patients are diagnosed. The primary tumour is in the majority of 
cases found in femur or tibia. GCTB is a locally aggressive tumour with at least two distinct cellular 
components: the neoplastic mononuclear stromal cells and the secondarily activated multinuclear giant 
cells. Standard of care is surgical resection either by curettage, usually complemented by various local 
procedures such as freezing and cementing, or by complete resection. Curettage has a high incidence of 
recurrence and is accompanied by malignant transformation in about 10% of subjects. Pulmonary 
metastases are rare (1-4%) but can be seen also with this otherwise benign neoplastic disease.  
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator nuclear 
receptor kappa ligand). RANKL is produced by the neoplastic mononuclear stromal cells of GCTB. RANKL 
binds to and activates RANK on monocyte/macrophage cells that mature to giant cells with osteoclast 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014

function. Denosumab binds to RANKL and thereby prevent binding of RANKL to RANK. It is hypothesised that 
this mechanism of action will lead to reduced osteolytic activity of GCTB and thereby prevents disease 
progression. It is also hypothesised that the extent of orthopaedic surgery needed will be reduced. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
Basic pharmacokinetics of denosumab have been evaluated in previous marketing authorisation applications 
(Xgeva and Prolia). New pharmacokinetic data for the current variation application is limited to serum trough 
levels of denosumab in patients with GCTB in one of the two efficacy/safety trials (study 20040215).   
The proposed dosing regimen for denosumab in treatment of GCTB is the same as the previously approved 
for prevention of skeletal related events in adults with bone metastases from solid tumours, i.e. 120 mg 
administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks. However, for GCTB the treatment is 
intended to have a direct effect on the tumour, as opposed to impacting the bone complications associated 
with metastatic disease, and a more rapid achievement of steady state is desirable at treatment of GCTB. 
Therefore, additional loading doses of 120 mg are given at Day 8 and Day 15 of treatment. The aim of the 
pharmacokinetic evaluation in GCTB was primarily to confirm that use of the loading doses is appropriate.  
Study 20040215 
Study 20040215 was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in adult subjects with unresectable or 
recurrent GCTB. The dosing schedule was 120 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W), 
with additional 120-mg loading doses administered on study days 8 and 15. One secondary objective of the 
study was to measure serum trough levels of denosumab. Blood samples for measurement of serum 
denosumab concentrations were collected at days 1 (baseline), 8, 15 and weeks 5 (day 29), 9, 13, 25, 49 
and end of study. 
Summary statistics are presented in the table below:  
Summary Statistics for Serum Denosumab Trough Concentrations (ng/mL) in Subjects with Giant Cell 
Tumor Following SC Dosing of Denosumab 120 mg Q4W with Additional Doses on Days 8 and 15  
Mean and median trough serum denosumab concentrations at the end of the loading dose (Week 5) were 
approximately 2-fold those following the first dose (predose on Day 8), indicating that the loading dose 
regimen increased systemic exposure to target levels as anticipated. Between Weeks 9 and 49, mean and 
median trough levels varied by less than 22% and 10%, respectively. Thus, exposures remained stable 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 4/68 
 
 
  
  
  
during the Q4W dosing period, indicating that denosumab pharmacokinetics did not change with time or 
upon multiple dosing.  
Previous data have indicated that in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours (not receiving 
additional loading doses), steady-state denosumab levels are reached in approximately 4 to 6 months with 
120 mg Q4W dosing.  The Company therefore considers the 120 mg Q4W dose regimen, with120-mg loading 
doses on days 8 and 15 of treatment, to be the appropriate dosing regimen for patients with GCTB.  
Safety of the use of loading doses has been assessed in the two pivotal studies in GCTB. Additional 
pharmacokinetic data is not considered necessary for approval of this new indication.  
Special populations 
Previously, denosumab has not been indicated in children and there is no pharmacokinetic data in children. 
The new indication GCTB is proposed to include skeletally mature adolescents. In study 20062004, a total of 
10 patients in the age range ≥12 years to <18 years were included, but pharmacokinetics was not evaluated 
in this study.  
Pharmacokinetics of an antibody is not expected to differ relevantly between skeletally mature adolescents 
and adults. The lack of pharmacokinetic data in adolescents is therefore acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Introduction 
Denosumab treatment of giant cell tumour of the bone was studied in two clinical trials (Studies 20040215 
and 20062004) using a fixed dose regimen based on experience from clinical use of denosumab for 
preventing cancer related skeletally related events (SRE). 
The dosing regimen was 120 mg denosumab administered SC Q4W, with 120-mg loading doses on days 8 
and 15 of treatment.  The 120 mg Q4W maintainance dose is the same as the approved for denosumab for 
prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors while the use of loading doses of 
denosumab is used for the first time in the treatment of GCTB, the intention being a rapid attainment of 
steady-state concentrations. The dose was selected based on earlier clinical experience in cancer patients 
treated for SRE and a theoretical consideration on the degree of receptor binding needed for a clinically 
maximal effect. No clinical dose-finding study for denosumab in GCTB was done. Patients were treated until 
progression. 
Denosumab has been investigated in two clinical studies both open, single-arm studies. Study 20040215, is 
completed. Study 20062004 is ongoing data are provided from a planned interim analysis including efficacy 
data up to 25 March 2011 and a safety update including data up to August 31 2012.  
A pooled analysis of radiological data from studies 20040215 and 20062004 to assess efficacy was carried 
out.  
In response to the second RSI a summary of updated efficacy and safety results from study 20062004 with 
507 enrolled patients and a data “snap-shot”, cut-off date 30 Aug 2013 was provided.

2.4.1.  Study 200401215 
2.4.1.1.  Study Participants and inclusion criteria  
Study 20040215 was an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study to evaluate the tumour response to 
treatment with denosumab, measured by histopathology (at least 90% elimination of giant cells relative to 
baseline, or complete elimination of giant cells in cases where giant cells represented < 5% of tumour cells) 
or radiography (lack of progression of the target lesion at week 25 as determined by the investigator), and 
the safety of denosumab in subjects with GCTB.  
To be included patients needed to have histologically confirmed GCTB, measurable (≥10 mm in the greatest 
dimension) recurrent GCTB confirmed by radiology, or unresectable GCTB.  
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 9/68 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The majority of the patients had unresectable disease. 
2.4.1.2.  Efficacy endpoints 
The major efficacy endpoints in Study 20040215 were: 
o  Primary 
  Response rate with response defined as: 90% elimination of giant cells or if giant 
cells represent less than 5% of tumour, complete elimination of giant cells, or  
 
Lack of investigator-assessed progression at Week 25 compared with baseline 
o  Exploratory 
 
Investigator-assessed clinical benefit, bone calcification, bone repair 
  Changes in bone turnover markers (sCTX, uNTX, BSAP, TRAP-5b, OC) (partly 
secondary objective) 
The study protocol was amended on 31 July 2007 after the first unplanned interim analysis. Due to feedback 
from investigators and observations made during this interim analysis, the definition of response was 
redefined  from elimination of giant cells, or doubling of the percentage of apoptotic giant cells, relative to 
baseline to as above criteria of radiologic progression was changed from 25%  increase volumetric 
measurement  to 20% change in longest dimension. The rationale for the change was “the pathologists, who 
were blinded to specimen identification, would search an entire sample for a single osteoclast, therefore, the 
original criteria could never be met” and “study centres reported that volume measurements were difficult to 
obtain”. 
Furthermore PET imaging that was optional in the original protocol was made a requirement (most study 
centres were already providing PET scans). Also a re-treatment option was added to allow subjects to 
continue receiving denosumab after disease recurrence following a response to denosumab treatment. It 
was anticipated that only a small number of subjects would require re-treatment and therefore, should not 
impact the results or conclusions.  
The safety follow-up period was shortened from 3 years to 2 years because 2 years was considered to be 
sufficient and consistent with other denosumab clinical studies. 
2.4.1.3.  Statistical methods 
The study had a single treatment arm and no control group. A total of 37 subjects with recurrent or 
un-resectable GCTB enrolled in the study. Efficacy results are reported as of the primary analysis with a data 
cut-off date of 07 April 2008.  No formal statistical hypothesis testing was made.

2.4.1.4.  Results  
Participant flow  
The subject disposition in study 20040215 is summarised in the table below. 
The subject discontinuing due to administrative reason stopped treatment due to complete response and 
was transferred to study 20062004 for follow-up.  
Summary of Main Efficacy Results 
A total of 37 subjects with primary unresectable (n=13), recurrent unresectable (n=18) and recurrent 
resectable (n=6) enrolled in the study, and all subjects received at least 1 dose of denosumab.  Efficacy 
results are reported with a cut-off date of 07 April 2008.  Of the 35 subjects included in the efficacy analysis 
set, 20 subjects had sufficient histology data while for 15 subjects the response criteria were based on 
radiology data alone. 
Of those 35 in the efficacy analysis, 30 met the efficacy criteria, 20 of 20 subjects with sufficient histology, 
and 10 of 15 subjects with only radiology data .Radiographic measurements of changes in longest lesion 
dimensions were generally consistent with the primary used volumetric endpoint analysis.  
The response rate was similar regardless of age (above or below median; 84 and 88% respectively) or prior 
bisphosphonate use (prior/ no prior; 80 and 87% respectively. 
Response as defined by the primary endpoint (at least 90% elimination of giant cells relative to baseline, or 
complete elimination of giant cells if giant cells < 5% of tumour cells, or lack of progression at week 25 by 
radiography if histopathology not available) was 86% with a considerable difference whether based on 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 11/68 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
histology (100%) or radiology (66.7%). The radiological response rate in subjects with histological data 
(10/13) is comparable with those without histological data (9/12).  
The quantitative histological response indicate  the presence of giant cells, which are not the neoplastic cells 
but rather normal cells that are recruited by RANKL excreted by neoplastic stromal cells and “used” by the 
neoplastic cells to create expansion space. There is support for the reduction in giant cell activity by both 
glucose utilisation and reduced levels of different bone metabolism markers. There is also a reduction of the 
neoplastic stromal cell area relative to the total tumour area compared to baseline and an increase in the 
extracellular matrix composed of collagen and osteoid and woven bone. 
Summary of percent reduction in the fraction of mononuclear tumour stromal component in 
GCTB 
Table 1 OC5 
The longest dimension of the target lesion decreased from baseline or did not change in 29 out of 37 subjects 
(83%). Eight subjects had increases in the longest dimension ≥  20% from baseline; of these subjects, 3 had 
longest dimensions that remained ≥  20% above baseline at the time points assessed. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 12/68 
 
 
 
  
  
  
Percentage changes from baseline in the longest dimensions of target lesions and non-target lesions were 
highly variable in subjects who had multiple lesions and who were unable to undergo palliative resection.  
Biomarkers: 
Urinary NTX/Cr and CTX were consistently suppressed (approximately 80% below baseline) from week 5 
onward. Other bone turnover markers (BSAP, osteocalcin, and TRAP-5b) also decreased from baseline and 
remained below baseline throughout the study.  
All mean values of the markers at baseline were in the range of the reference values except TRAP-5b that 
was increased at baseline.   
Clinical benefit, increased bone calcification and bone repair at the lesion were observed with denosumab 
treatment (see table below).  (NB clinical benefit is the investigator ticking Y with a free written motivation 
to the column entry “clinical benefit”, examples include positive evaluation of radiological examination data 
as well pain reduction and improved mobility).  
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 13/68 
 
 
 
  
  
  
Obviously the effects on bone metabolism markers are not clearly due to effects on the tumours as the levels 
may well be determined by the activity in the remaining and healthy skeletal tissue.

2.4.2.  Study 20062004 
2.4.2.1.  Study Participants and inclusion criteria  
Study 20062004 is an ongoing phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in adult and skeletally mature 
adolescent subjects with GCTB, designed to primarily evaluate the safety of denosumab, as well as tumour 
response as determined by the investigator. Three cohorts have been enrolled: 
Cohort 1:  subjects with surgically unsalvageable (unresectable) disease (e.g, sacral or spinal GCTB, or 
multiple lesions including pulmonary metastases). 
Cohort 2:  subjects with surgically salvageable (resectable) disease whose planned on-study surgery was 
associated with severe morbidity (eg, joint resection, limb amputation, or hemipelvectomy). 
Cohort 3:  subjects who rolled over from Study 20040215. 
No patients with primary resectable disease were included. 
Patients were treated with denosumab Q4W (with an initial loading dose on day 8 and 15) until progression 
or complete resection. After complete resection 6 further doses were given.  
2.4.2.2.  Efficacy endpoints 
The major efficacy endpoints in Study 20062004 were: 
o  Secondary 
 
 
Time to disease progression (Cohort 1) 
Proportion of subjects without any surgery at month 6 (Cohort 2) 
o  Exploratory 
 
Investigator-assessed clinical benefit 
 
Time to disease progression (All subjects) 
  Change in BPI-SF “worst” pain score from baseline 
  Change in analgesic score from baseline 
 
Proportion of subjects able to undergo a less morbid surgical procedure compared to 
planned surgical procedure at baseline (Cohort 2) 
A copy of imaging reports and all available pathology reports within a year before enrollment as performed 
as per standard of care were to be provided. During the study pathology samples, pathology reports and 
imaging reports were to be submitted if performed as standard of care. Pathology samples and pathology 
reports were to be provided at end of study to a central imaging vendor for evaluation of disease response 
as per amendment 5 (05 May 2011). 
Imaging reports (PET, CT, PET/CT, MRI or X-ray were included only if as performed as local standard of care 
and at intervals as per local standard of care.. Efficacy assessments were based upon lesions which were 
selected by the investigator using the criteria that target lesions should be both measurable and accessible 
for biopsy. All tumour assessments were based on investigator´s evaluation.  
As the primary objective of study 20062004 was to evaluate the safety of denosumab efficacy was not 
up-front systematically evaluated.  
A pooled radiological analysis was performed.  
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 15/68 
 
  
  
  
2.4.2.3.  Statistical methods 
The study 20062004 had a single treatment arm and no control group.  
As of 25 March 2011 (date of pre-planned interim analysis 3), 286 subjects were enrolled. In Cohort 1 
(unresectable), n = 170, in Cohort 2 (resectable) n = 101 and in Cohort 3 (i.e. roll-over from study 
20040215) n = 11. Four subjects from Study 20040215 were enrolled directly into the safety follow up 
phase; these subjects were not included in the treatment phase analysis presented. 
A safety up-date was performed for data up to August 31 2012 and included 251 subjects in Cohort 1, 209 
subjects in Cohort 2 and 12 subjects in Cohort 3.  
In response to the second RSI a summary of updated efficacy and safety results from study 20062004 with 
507 enrolled patients at a data “snap-shot” cut-off date 30 Aug 2013 was provided. (See below.) 
 No formal statistical hypothesis testing was made.

At the interims analysis 241 enrolled patients were continuing in the study, 41 had discontinued study 
(reasons see below).  
Ten skeletally mature adolscent subjects were included (two had discontinued treatment and study, one due 
to loss to follow up and one due to pregnancy).

The administrative reasons for discontinuations have been specified, by the applicant. The majority of cases 
are considered disease related. 
Summary of Main Efficacy Results 
Cohort 1 (Time to disease progression) 
In total seven patients had progressive disease or died.  Six of 169 (3.6%) had investigator-determined 
disease progression and one patient died. For the six subjects with investigator-determined disease 
progression (none of which were adolescent subjects), the initial clinical determinations of disease 
progression were made 85 to 498 days after first denosumab. 
In cohort 1 the median time to disease progression was not reached.

Cohort 2 (Proportion of subjects without any surgery at month 6) 
At the time for the interim report, 71 subjects had received > 1 dose of denosumab and had participated in 
the study for> 6 months. Of these, 64 subjects, 90% (64/71) had not undergone surgery by month 6. 
Overall 74 patients had no surgery performed. Twenty-six  patients in cohort 2 did undergo surgery, the 
Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to surgery was 723 days.  Of these 26 subjects, 16 were able to 
undergo a less morbid procedure compared with the surgical procedure planned at baseline 
In total two patients died or had progressive disease in cohort 2. 
In total two patients in cohort 1, and ten patients in cohort 2 had a complete resection.

The MAH has carried out an analysis of recommended surgery by independent orthopaedic oncologists. 
There was a trend towards recommending less severe surgery. The clinically most important observation 
being the number of recommended joint resections, or amputations, reduced from 17 to 10. 
Pathologic findings: 
Forty subjects had on-study histopathology procedures performed (18 subjects in Cohort 1 and 22 subjects 
in Cohort 2); of these, 24 subjects  (5 and 19 respectively) had based on the investigator’s assessment a 
pathologic response to denosumab treatment, and 19 subjects had histopathology findings denoting the 
absence of active tumour cells, see table below.  
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 22/68 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The definition of pathologic response is the same in study 20040215 and 20062004. The reason for 
histopathological evaluation in 20062004 was driven by clinical questions.  
Among subjects in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3, the respective median (range) time on-study was 12.98 
(0.3, 29.1) months, 9.23 (0.0, 28.0) months, and 5.36 (4.5, 6.2) months.  The median exposure to 
denosumab was 13.0 doses, with the longest exposure being 33 doses. For adolescent subjects, the median 
duration were 9.02 (3.3, 17.3) months.

Pain 
For subjects with or without an objective tumour response, the mean and median worst pain scores at 
baseline were higher than at any time on study.  The only exception was day 8 median scores for subjects 
with an objective tumour response Cohorts 1 and 2 combined, in which the median scores were the same as 
those observed at baseline.  
At study enrolment, 75% (209 of 280) of subjects in the efficacy analysis set had no/low analgesic use (ie, 
an analgesic score ≤ 2) and 25% (71 of 280) of subjects had strong opioid use (ie, an analgesic score ≥ 3).  
Very few subjects shifted from no/low analgesic use to strong opioid use during their participation in the 
study the proportion of subjects in the PRO analysis set with no/low analgesic use at baseline who shifted to 
strong opioid use at any study visit was < 5.0% in Cohort 1, <5.3% in Cohort 2, and < 4.7% among all 
subjects (all cohorts combined). 
Mean worst pain scores by visit are summarized in the table below.

The applicant has provided an analysis of discontinuations stratified according to baseline pain levels with no 
indication of a larger drop-out rate in those with severe pain. 
Updated efficacy response to second RSI: 
In response to the second RSI a summary of updated efficacy and safety results from study 20062004 with 
507 enrolled patients and a data “snap-shot” cut-off date 30 Aug 2013 was provided. In total 263 patients 
in cohort 1, 232 in cohort 2 and 12 patients in cohort 3 (rolled over from study 20040215) were included. 
The median time on study was for cohort 1 26.7 months (0-58.0), for cohort 2 15.2 months (0.1-57.2) and 
cohort 3 34.5 months (12.8-35.4). A total of 415 patients were treated >1 year, 222 patients>2 years, 108 
patients> 3 years and 37 patients<4 years. 
In total 21 of 258 treated subjects (8.1%) in cohort 1, 10 of 228 (4.4%) in cohort 2 and 0 of 11 patients in 
cohort 3 had disease progression. 
Although per eligibility criteria, Cohort 1 subjects did not have surgery planned at baseline, during the 
course of treatment, 34 subjects became eligible to have surgery. Surgery were in the following locations: 
lower extremities (8 subjects, 3.1%), upper extremities (7 subjects, 2.7%), and pelvis (6 subjects, 2.4%).   
Of the 225 subjects with surgically salvageable disease in cohort 2 (excluding 3 subjects with lung or soft 
tissue lesions 109 had no GCTB surgery performed over the entire study and 84 underwent a less morbid 
surgical procedure compared to planned at base line. Twenty six of 225 (11.7%) subjects underwent their 
originally planned surgery.  
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 28/68 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The most common locations of on-study GCTB surgery by baseline target lesion were lower extremities (72 
subjects, 31.6%), upper extremities (35, 15.4%), and pelvis (11, 4.8%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 
median time to all GCTB surgery in Cohort 2 was 261 days.

A total of 13 (23.2%) of 56 subjects who discontinued study drug in Cohort 1 had disease progression or 
recurrence after discontinuation of denosumab.   
Of the 102 subjects, who discontinued denosumab for reasons other than disease progression in cohort 2, 
fifteen (14.7%) had local recurrence after discontinuation of denosumab. The majority of patients 
discontinued denosumab based on protocol specific treason complete resection (96 subjects).

Disease progression/recurrence after surgery 
Six subjects of 34 subjects with GCTB surgery in Cohort 1 (17.6%) had disease progression or recurrence 
after GCTB surgery, and 18 subjects of 127 subjects with GCTB surgery in Cohort 2 (14.2%) had disease 
progression or recurrence after GCTB surgery. The  median time to disease progression or recurrence was 
not reached; Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that the proportion of subjects with disease progression or 
recurrence over time for Cohort 1 was 3.0% (0.0, 8.9) at week 25, 8.4% (0.0, 20.1) at week 49, and 19.9% 
(1.9, 37.9) at week 73, and 29.9% (5.7, 54.1) at week 98 for Cohort 2 was 3.4% (0.1, 6.7) at week 25, 
5.5% (1.2, 9.8) at week 49, and 18.1% (9.9, 26.2) at week 73, and 21.0% (12.2, 29.9) at week 98.

2.5.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No special populations were investigated for the GCTB indication. Ten subjects in study 20062004 were 
skeletally mature adolescents. Among the skeletally mature adolescents in cohort 1 (n=8) five had partial 
response and three had stable disease. In cohort 1 (n=2) two had stable disease. The Kaplan Meier estimate 
of median time to surgery was 261 days. 
After the safety update in August 2012 there are 15 adolescents. 
In the data snap-shot August 2013 18 adolescents were included.

2.6.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
2.6.1.  Outcomes/endpoints 
A retrospective independent radiographic review of tumour response was performed by a central imaging 
vendor for Studies 20040215 and 20062004 to provide further clinical evidence of a denosumab treatment 
effect on tumour regression. Key design aspects were agreed following consultation with regulatory 
authorities.  
For the retrospective radiographic review CT, MRI, and/or PET were provided (if available) for assessment of 
tumour response and disease progression. Plain X-ray film, bone scans, or ultrasounds were not evaluated 
in the independent imaging analysis. 
An objective tumour response was defined as either a CR or PR, determined using the best response 
evaluated by any of the following response criteria: modified RECIST 1.1 (CT/MRI), modified EORTC criteria 
using 18FDG-PET, and modified inverse Choi criteria (density/size) to evaluate tumour size by CT/MRI and 
density using Hounsfield units on CT.  These 3 response criteria were used to collectively define and 
characterize objective tumour response in subjects with GCTB. 
There are no well-established tumour response criteria in GCTB as RECIST is primarily used in soft tissue 
tumours, FDG/PET measures the metabolic activity and modified Choi criteria (increase in lesion density and 
the longest diameter measured on CT or MRI).  
2.6.2.  Study Participants  
Patients with imaging data from studies 20040215 and 20062004 were included (roll-over patients from 
study 200415 were only included once). For internal validity an imaging control group was formed from 26 
patients with at least 3 pre-treatment images available. 
The study population is described below under “Participant flow”.

In total imaging data were not available for 10 patients in study 20040215 and 98 patients in 20062004. 
There were no notable differences in baseline demographic and disease characteristics or clinical outcomes 
between subjects with radiological evaluations and subjects without radiological evaluations in Studies 
20062004 and 20040215. Furthermore, when the reasons for missing evaluations were further evaluated, 
there was no indication of bias in the collection of radiographic evaluations.  
In the objective tumor response analysis set, 38 discontinued the study (see below). 
In the objective analysis set the median time on study was 13.4 months and median number of doses 16 
(4-54 doses).

Tumour Response 
More patients have a response in terms of modified EORTC (FDG/PET) metabolic activity and modified Choi 
(density/size) than RECIST.  The could be explained by the fact that modified Choi could be derived from the 
density component alone ( in an ad hoc analysis 41.8% of responses were based on both density and size, 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 35/68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
30.6% on density component alone, and 27.6% on size alone.  A partial response by modified RECIST 
requires at least a 30% reduction in sum of the longest diameter (SLD) for target lesion, whereas a partial 
response for density/size requires at least a 10% reduction in SLD. The responses above could reflect the 
less stringent size response criteria and the additional response criteria for density alone. 
Longest diameter: 
Density: 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 36/68 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
A statistically significant moderate correlation was observed between RECIST and density/size evaluations: 
27.2% of subjects had a response by both criteria (Phi correlation coefficient = 0.35; p-value < 0.001). 
RECIST response was only weakly correlated with EORTC (Phi correlation coefficient = 0.09; p-value = 
1.00). A moderate correlation was also observed between density/size and EORTC, although the relationship 
was not statistically significant (Phi correlation coefficient: 0.55; p-value = 0.115). 
The median time (95% CI) to objective tumour response among responders was 2.8 months (2.76, 2.89) 
based on best response using any tumour response criteria. The median time (95% CI) to objective tumour 
response after the first dose of denosumab for all evaluable subjects was 3.1 months (2.89, 3.65) based on 
the best response using any tumour response criteria.  The figure below shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for 
the time to objective tumour response based on best response using any tumour response criteria for all 
evaluable subjects.

Based on the clinical data, eleven of the 190 subjects (5.8%) in the objective tumor response analysis set 
had radiologic evidence of disease progression at any time using any of the 3 evaluation criteria, as 
determined by the independent radiographic analysis. For these 11 subjects, the radiological determinations 
of disease progression were made 0.2 to 21.9 months (median 3.68 months) after the first dose of 
denosumab.

Study Month
N = number of enrolled subjects who were eligible for the study, received at least 1 dose of denosumab, and

Source:  Figure tiae4.1.1.1 (21June2012:14:53:39)
Based on clinical outcome measures of treatment response as assessed by the investigator in the individual 
clinical studies (ie, time to disease progression, proportion of subjects without surgery at month 6, and 
disease status for Study 20062004), clinical outcomes for evaluable subjects and those without imaging 
data were similar. 
Subgroup analyses 
The adolescent population was included in the independent evaluation of objective tumour response and 6 
had at least 1 evaluable time point assessment. As of the data cut-off all 6 remained on study and were 
receiving denosumab; they had unresectable GCTB. The median time on-study was 6.3 months, the median 
number of denosumab doses received was 9.5, and the maximum number 21. Based on best response using 
any tumour response criteria, 66.7% (4 of 6) had an objective tumour response; 33.3% (2 of 6) had an 
objective tumour response based on modified RECIST and 66.7% (4 of 6) based on density / size. No 
adolescent was evaluable by modified EORTC criteria.

2.7.  Overall conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The majority of the patients included in the GCTB studies are inoperable or have disease where surgery 
would lead to severe morbidity. As indicated in the interims analysis in study 20062004 about 10% had 
received previous chemotherapy, 20% had previous radiotherapy, 60% had previous surgery.  
The data provided demonstrate that denosumab has a number of pharmacological effects expected from the 
mode of action i.e. that activation of osteoclast-like giant cells is inhibited. The histopathological results 
obtained in study 20040215 provide support for this conclusion and it is supported by the reduced metabolic 
activity evident from the PET-data. The histopathology results in study 20062004 and study 20040215 
relate to the reduction of the number of giant cells, which is consistently seen in most evaluable subjects. 
The applicant also describes a reduction of the neoplastic stromal cell area relative to the total tumour area 
compared to baseline and an increase in the extracellular matrix composed of collagen and osteoid and 
woven bone. 
The efficacy endpoints were based on investigators assessments, in the interims analyses of inoperable 
patients (cohort 1) only 6 of 169 enrolled patients had disease progression, and at the data snap-shot, two 
years later, 21 of the 258 enrolled patients had progressive disease based on investigator assessment. For 
patients where surgery would lead to severe morbidity (cohort 2) at the interims analysis two of 100 patients 
had progressive disease and at the data snap-shot 10/228 had progressive disease.   
A retrospective independent review of imaging data was performed for patients enrolled in study 20040215 
and 20062004. About half of the patients enrolled were included in the retrospective analyses; there were no 
obvious differences between subjects included/not included in the retrospective analyses. The majority of 
patients (72%) had a response in the retrospective analyse, however the vast part was defined by 
density/length (modified inverse Choi) or metabolic activity (EORTC/18FDG-PET), only 25% had a response 
as defined by RECIST. 
Support for a clinically meaningful effect of denosumab is provided by the reported reduction in both 
frequency and severity of surgery.  At the interims analysis 90% (64/71) of the enrolled patients in cohort 
2 had not had surgery by month 6. The applicant has provided a blinded independent evaluation of surgery 
required supporting the investigators assessments. This was consistent with data from the data snap-shot 
where 92% (209/228) had not undergone surgery by month 6.  
Although per inclusion subjects in cohort 1 were inoperable, 34 subjects became eligible to have surgery.  
In cohort 2 109 had no GCTB surgery performed over the entire study and 84 underwent a less morbid 
surgical procedure compared to planned at base line. Twenty six of 225 (11.7%) subjects underwent their 
originally planned surgery.  
In total two patients in cohort 1, and ten patients in cohort 2 had a complete resection by the time of the 
interims analysis. At the update data snap-shot about 20 % of the patients in the whole study had complete 
resections 13 (4.9%) in cohort 1 and 91 (39.2%) in cohort 2.  
Six subjects of 34 subjects with GCTB surgery in Cohort 1 (17.6%) had disease progression or recurrence 
after GCTB surgery, and 18 subjects of 127 subjects with GCTB surgery in Cohort 2 (14.2%) had disease 
progression or recurrence after GCTB surgery. 
There was a reported investigator-judged beneficial effect and reduction in pain, however most patients did 
not have a severe analgesic use at start of the study. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 41/68 
  
  
  
The single-arm design and the lack of historical controls for the two studies reduce the certainty with which 
conclusions can be drawn from the data. Furthermore, the objective efficacy variables in study 20062004 
were not systematically collected. The observation time, also including the last update, is  limited to about 
200 patients that are treated beyond two years and 100 beyond three years in the context of the time to 
recurrence rate  with two years as  the duration frequently cited in the literature study data is still limited.  
The number of adolescents is also very limited n=10 in the original safety set, n=15 at the August 2012 
up-date, and n= 18 in the data snap-shot. 
The duration of treatment has in the studies been to progression or complete resection, there is no data on 
shorter treatment duration than until progression, but from the very limited data there are no indications on 
a rebound effect after denosumab was discontinued. 
2.7.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
There are several lines of evidence that support that denosumab has the intended biological effect and also 
a clinically meaningful effect. Although the main effect seems to be stabilising the disease, a few patients has 
become operable and a larger number has undergone less morbid surgery than initially planned. There is 
also data on a clinical benefit and pain reduction, however with regards to the nature of the disease and the 
non-controlled study these results are hard to fully evaluate. The duration of treatment is, except 
continuation until progression, not exhaustively evaluated and this has been addressed in the SmPC. The 
long-term effects need to be further addressed as proposed in the final analysis of 20062004 and proposed 
study 20140114. 
2.8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The denosumab clinical development program as of the 25 March 2011 data cutoff date for the GCTB 
indication includes two phase 2 studies including 304 subjects:  Study 20040215 a, which enrolled 37 
subjects, and Study 20062004, an ongoing study with safety data for 281 subjects (including 14 patients 
who previously participated in Study 20040215). Ten patients were below 18 years. 
Additional safety data was collected for study 20062004 through 31 Aug 2012. In total data for 472 subjects 
who had received at least 1 dose of denosumab, including 251 subjects in Cohort 1, 209 subjects in Cohort 
2, and 12 subjects in Cohort 3. The median time on study 15.54 months (0.1, 46.3) months. 
As a response to the second RSI a further update including 501 patients in study 20062004 was provided 
(see below). 
Denosumab 120 mg SC Q4W has been approved for preventing or reducing the risk of skeletal-related 
events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  Three pivotal international, phase 3, 
randomized, double blind, active controlled clinical studies provided the primary support for the denosumab 
XGEVA Advanced Cancer (SRE) marketing application.  The primary safety evaluations for this program 
included data from 2841 subjects administered denosumab. A summary of the exposure data for GCTB and 
SRE treatment based on the March 2011 read-out are shown in the table below.

ONJ 
At the interim analysis (median time on study 11.2 months), the overall subject incidence of ONJ positively 
adjudicated by the external adjudication committee was 1.3% (4 subjects): 2.7% (1 subject) in Study 
20040215 (median time on study 19.4 months) and 1.1% (3 subjects) in Study 20062004 (median time on 
study 10.4 months).  Two of the 4 subjects had a tooth extraction prior to the ONJ event.  One subject 
received oral antibiotic rinses for treatment of ONJ, and 2 subjects received antibiotics and limited dental 
procedures.  The last subject underwent open dissection of the sinuses, osteotomy of the upper jaw, 
oral-antral fistula closure, and extraction of 4 teeth. 
At the update (Aug 2012), further 3 cases were reported. 
Of the seven cases in total 2 had resolved and 5 were reported ongoing.

Malignancies 
No malignancies were reported in Study 20040215.  Three malignancies were reported in Study 20062004, 
2 bone sarcomas and 1 thyroid cancer; none of these was considered to be related to denosumab by the 
investigators.  The 2 bone sarcomas were serious adverse events resulting in denosumab discontinuation 
and discontinuation from the study. 
In addition, 5 subjects discontinued the studies due to disease progression (2 subjects discontinued 
Study 20040215 and 3 subjects discontinued Study 20062004).  Two additional subjects were diagnosed 
with osteosarcoma following discontinuation from Study 20040215. 
Overall, there were 9 subjects with either bone malignancy or disease progression: 5 subjects with disease 
progression, 2 subjects with osteosarcoma following discontinuation, and 2 subjects with bone malignancy.  
Based on information available for each case, 4 of these subjects appeared to have malignant 
transformation of GCTB, with 1 of these cases being associated with prior radiotherapy.  Three subjects had 
either prior history of osteosarcoma or sarcoma present at baseline, and 2 subjects appeared to have 
sarcoma that was misdiagnosed as GCTB.   
At the update further two subjects reported malignancies one case of sarcoma and one case of giant cell 
bone tumour. 
2.8.3.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
At the interim analysis thirty-four subjects (11.2%) had experienced serious adverse events and 3 subjects 
(1.0%) experienced serious adverse events considered related to investigational product. There were two 
cases each of osteonecrosis of the jaw and osteomyelitis and there was one each of the remaining SAEs. By 
MedDRA the rates were highest in investigations in infections and infestations (3.0%) injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications (3.0%); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.0%); neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (1.6%); and nervous system disorders (1.6%) 
One subject in each study (0.7% overall) died, in study 200415 “neoplasm malignant” and in study 
20062004, respiratory failure. Both patients had pulmonary metastases.   
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 48/68 
 
 
  
  
  
In the update (Aug 2012) Serious adverse events were reported for 47 subjects (10.7%) during the 
reporting interval from last update. Back pain were reported for five patients, four with bone giant cell 
tumour, three with ONJ,  two patients each had appendicitis, cellulitis, subcutaneous abcess and anemia 
reported.  All other events were reported for one patient.  
Four patients died, the reported events were bone giant cell tumour, sarcoma, complete suicide and 
respiratory failure. 
Two cases of hyperparathyroidism were reported; increased levels of PTH were reported. 
2.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Denosumab administration was associated with mild, transient decreases in serum calcium in studies 
20040215 and 20062004.  Subject incidence of grade 2 calcium decreases was 8/304 (2.6%). 
Denosumab administration was associated with decreases in serum phosphorus in studies 20040215 and 
20062004.  CTCAE grade 3 low phosphorus values were observed for 3 subjects (8.1%) in Study 20040215 
and 26 subjects (9.3%) in study 20062004. 
Hypocalcemia as well as hypophosphatemia are included as ADRs in the SmPC. 
No other clinically significant changes in laboratory variables are reported from the two studies in GCTB 
populations. 
The laboratory findings were in line with previously observed changes. 
2.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
The pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of denosumab were evaluated in a phase 1 study in healthy 
volunteers and subjects with impaired renal function (Study 20040245).  Overall, the results of this study 
indicate that no dose adjustments of denosumab are required when administered to patients with renal 
impairment.  In this study, the potential for hypocalcemia in subjects with severe renal impairment or 
subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis appeared greater compared with subjects who had 
mild or moderate renal impairment and with subjects who had normal renal function. This is addressed in an 
ongoing type II variation. 
Denosumab has not been evaluated in subjects with impaired liver function.  
The lack of studies in patients with impaired liver function is acceptable on the basis of the pharmacokinetics 
of denosumab and its effects on liver CYP-enzymes. 
Paediatric population: In total ten patients above the age of 12 with giant cell tumour of the bone were 
included in study 20062004. In the update (Aug 2012) in total 15 adolescents were treated, and in the data 
snap-shot (Aug 2013) in total 18 adolescents were treated. 
2.8.6.  Immunological events 
No subjects tested positive for binding antidenosumab antibodies during Studies 20040215 or 20062004, 
consistent with the low incidence of binding antibodies observed throughout the denosumab clinical 
development program (< 1 of over 3000 denosumab-treated subjects in the studies included in the 
denosumab Advanced Cancer marketing application).  No neutralizing antibodies have been reported in any 
denosumab clinical study to date. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 49/68 
  
  
  
2.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been made. 
This is acceptable on the basis of the pharmacokinetics of denosumab and it’s effects on liver CYP-enzymes.

The most common adverse events were consistent with previous reported events (arthralgia, fatigue, 
headache, pain in extremity, back pain and nausea). Adverse events of grade 3-5 were reported for 24%. 
In total 18% of the subjects experienced serious adverse events the most common events were ONJ (7 
subjects 1.4%), back pain (5 subjects 1.0%, bone giant cell tumour out of one was a malignant 
transformation (5 subjects 1.0 %), anemia (4 subjects 0.8%), appendicitis (4 subjects, 0.8%) and 
gastroenteritsis (3 subjects, 0.6%). 
In total 5 patients had died during the treatment phase, the reported fatal adverse events were disease 
progression, suicide, two respiratory failures, transformation to high-grade sarcoma. 
The only events that lead to discontinuation of study in more than one patient wee ONJ in 4 subjects and 
sarcoma in 2 subjects. 
ONJ  
Ten patients had positively adjucate ONJs during the treatment phase and one during follow-up phase (the 
event started 117 days after discontinuation of denosumab, five had resolved and 6 were ongoing at time of 
the data snap-shot. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014

New primary malignancies: Eleven cases were reported during the treatment period;  two  sarcomas, two 
cases of breast cancer, one of each of bone giant cell tumour, bone sarcoma, neoplasm progression, 
papillary thyroid cancer, spindle cell sarcoma, soft tissue neoplasm and one case of tumour pain. 
GCTB malignancy (cases of primary malignant GCTB (PMGCTB), secondary malignant GCTB (SMGCTB) 
and sarcomatuos transformation (ST); Ten cases were reported during treatment period.  Of these two were 
reported as secondary malignant GCTB, three subjects had sarcomatous transformation that were reported 
as new primary malignancies.  
Pregnancies  
Thirteen subjects became pregnant, 6 had elective or spontaneious abortions, three withdrew from study 
and had full-term infants without complications and the rest the outcome is unknown. 
There were 11 paternal exposures. 
Follow-up phase  
Fifteen SAEs were reported; 2 subjects each of anemia, asthenia, death, metastases to lung and nausea, all 
other events in one case each. 
Fatal events were reported in 8 cases (progression in six cases and unknown in two cases). 
ONJ, Malignancies  
One case of positively adjudicated ONJ and one case of PMGCTB were reported, three patients had new 
malignancies (one PMGCTB, one adenocarcinoma of the colon and one bronchioalveolar carcinoma). 
2.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable for GTCB. 
2.9.  Overall conclusions on clinical safety 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The major safety results seem consistent with data from previous studies, no new major safety concerns has 
emerged. However, further follow-up is needed to exclude effects related to long-term treatment.  
Almost all patients experienced adverse events, about 5% led to treatment (or study) discontinuations. 
About 20 % experienced serious adverse events at the date of the data snap-shot. The most common SAEs 
were ONJ (7 subjects, 1.4%), back pain (5 subjects) and bone giant cell tumour of the bone (5 subjects). In 
total five patients had fatal events. 
The main safety concerns are: ONJ, which is an established adverse effect, and a potential impact on 
malignant transformation, which is part of the natural course of GCTB.  In total 10 subjects had positively 
adjudicated ONJ during the treatment phase but also one case was reported in the follow-up phase 3 months 
post-treatment. Six of the ONJs were ongoing at the time for the data snap-shot.  
There were six cases reported of malignant transformation, two cases of secondary malignancy of giant cell 
tumour of the bone and four cases of sarcomatous transformation (two of which transformation to malignant 
lung lesions) as per the data snap-shot. Three of those had had previous radiotherapy. 
Both for ONJ and malignant transformation there were cases reported post-treatment. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 53/68 
  
  
  
A difficulty in the evaluation of safety profile of denosumab is the uncontrolled study design. The subjects in 
this indication are younger and will be exposed for a longer duration than in previously approved indication, 
also the rarity of important events such as ONJ and malignant transformation indicate the need for follow-up 
both during treatment and follow-up including sufficient number of patients.   
Finally, the number of adolescents studied is small and does not allow any clear safety conclusions for this 
group per se. An acceptance of this patient group based on the present safety data has to rely on 
assumptions about similarities with adult subjects and not on the experience with the adolescent subjects.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile so far is consistent with the known safety profile of denosumab. However as the exposure 
in the current indication is longer than for previous indications; further safety follow-up is needed to allow 
more adequate assessments of safety, as proposed with  the study 20140114 which is part of the agreed 
RMP.

2.11.  Changes to the Product Information 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
The following changes to the SmPC were agreed following the CHMP assessment of the data: 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or 
surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumours.  
Treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is 
unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology  
Supplementation of at least 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily is required in all patients, unless 
hypercalcaemia is present (see section 4.4). 
Bone metastases from solid tumours 
The recommended dose of XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal related events is 120 mg administered as a 
single subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm.  
Supplementation of at least 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily is required in all patients, unless 
hypercalcaemia is present (see section 4.4). 
Giant cell tumour of bone 
The recommended dose of XGEVA for the treatment of giant cell tumour of bone is 120 mg administered as a 
single subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm with additional 120 mg 
doses on days 8 and 15 of treatment. 
Patients in the phase II study who underwent complete resection of giant cell tumour of bone did receive an 
additional 6 months of treatment following the surgery as per study protocol.   
Patients with giant cell tumour of bone should be evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether they 
continue to benefit from treatment.  In patients whose disease is controlled by XGEVA, the effect of 
interruption or cessation of treatment has not been evaluated, however limited data in these patients does not 
indicate a rebound effect upon cessation of treatment.  
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Experience in patients on 
dialysis or with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) is limited (see section 4.4 for 
recommendations relating to monitoring of calcium).  
Patients with hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of denosumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 
5.2). 
Elderly patients (age ≥ 65) 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population  
Treatment of skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is unresectable or where surgical 
resection is likely to result in severe morbidity: the posology is the same as in adults. 
XGEVA is not recommended in paediatric patients (age < 18) other than skeletally mature adolescents with 
giant cell tumour of bone. as the safety and efficacy of XGEVA in these patients have not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of XGEVA have not been evaluated in paediatric patients (age < 18) other than 
skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
…………………….. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has occurred in patients treated with XGEVA. In clinical trials, the incidence of 
ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure (see section 4.8); ONJ has also been diagnosed after 
treatment with Xgeva with the majority of cases occurring within 5 months after the last dose. 
Patients who developed ONJ in clinical studies generally had known risk factors for ONJ, including invasive 
dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery), poor oral hygiene or other pre-existing 
dental disease, advanced malignancies, infections, or concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, 
corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to the head and neck). A dental examination with 
appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with XGEVA in patients with active 
dental and jaw conditions (as listed above). While on treatment, patients should avoid invasive dental 
procedures if possible.  
………………………… 
Malignancy in Giant Cell Tumour of Bone or progression to metastatic disease is an infrequent event and a 
known risk in patients with Giant Cell Tumour of Bone. Patients should be monitored for radiological signs of 
malignancy, new radiolucency or osteolysis. Available clinical data does not suggest an increased risk of 
malignancy in GCTB patients treated with XGEVA. 
…………………………….. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no adequate data from the use of XGEVA in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity was shown in a 
study of cynomolgus monkeys, dosed throughout pregnancy with denosumab at AUC exposures 12-fold higher 
than the human dose (see section 5.3).   
XGEVA is not recommended for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using highly 
effective contraception. Women should be advised not to become pregnant during and for at least 5 months 
after treatment with XGEVA. Any effects of Xgeva are likely to be greater during the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy since monoclonal antibodies are transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as 
pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions reported in three phase 
III and one two phase II clinical studies (see table 1): very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each 
frequency grouping and system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

In two phase II single-arm clinical trials in patients with giant cell tumour of bone, hypocalcaemia was reported 
in 5.7% of patients. None of the adverse events was considered serious. 
……………………… 
In two phase II single-arm clinical trials in patients with giant cell tumour of bone, ONJ occurred in 2.3% (12 of 
523) of patients treated with XGEVA (median overall exposure of 20.3 months; range: 0 -83.4). The patient 
year adjusted incidence of ONJ was 0.2% during the first year of treatment and 1.7% in the second year. The 
median time to ONJ was 19.4 months (range: 11 - 40). Based on duration of exposure, there are insufficient 
data in GCTB patients to assess risk of ONJ beyond 2 years. 
……………. 
Paediatric population 
XGEVA was studied in an open label trial that enrolled 18 skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell 
tumour of bone. Based on these limited data, the adverse event profile appeared to be similar to adults.

5.1  
  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for the treatment of bone diseases – other drugs affecting bone structure 
and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX04 
Mechanism of action 
RANKL exists as a transmembrane or soluble protein. RANKL is essential for the formation, function and 
survival of osteoclasts, the sole cell type responsible for bone resorption. Increased osteoclast activity, 
stimulated by RANKL, is a key mediator of bone destruction in metastatic bone disease and multiple myeloma. 
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and specificity to 
RANKL, preventing the RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring and resulting in reduced osteoclast 
numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and cancer-induced bone destruction.  
Giant cell tumours of bone are characterized by neoplastic stromal cells expressing RANK ligand and 
osteoclast-like giant cells expressing RANK. In patients with giant cell tumour of bone, denosumab binds to 
RANK ligand, significantly reducing or eliminating osteoclast-like giant cells. Consequently, osteolysis is 
reduced and proliferative tumour stroma is replaced with non-proliferative, differentiated, densely woven new 
bone.

………………………… 
Clinical efficacy in adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone 
The safety and efficacy of XGEVA was studied in two Phase II open-label, single arm trials (studies 4 and 5) 
that enrolled 529 patients with giant cell tumour of bone that was either unresectable or for which surgery 
would be associated with severe morbidity.  
Study 4 enrolled 37 adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or recurrent giant cell tumour of 
bone. Response criteria included elimination of giant cells based on histopathology or lack of progression by 
radiography. 
Of the 35 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 85.7% (95% CI: 69.7, 95.2) had a treatment response to 
XGEVA. All 20 patients (100%) with histology assessments responded. Of the remaining 15 patients, 10 
(67%) radiographic measurements showed no progression of the target lesion. 
Study 5 enrolled 507 adult or skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone and evidence of 
measurable active disease.  
In Cohort 1 (patients with surgically unsalvageable disease), median time to disease progression was not 
reached, 21 of the 258 treated patients had disease progression. In Cohort 2 (patients with surgically 
salvageable disease whose planned surgery was associated with severe morbidity), 209 of the 228 evaluable 
patients treated with XGEVA had not undergone surgery by month 6. Overall of 225 patients for whom giant 
cell tumours of bone surgery (excluding lung metastases only) was planned, 109 had no surgery performed and 
84 underwent a less morbid procedure than planned at baseline.  The median time to surgery was 261 days. 
Upon enrolment of 305 patients in studies 4 and 5 a retrospective independent review of radiographic imaging 
data was performed. One hundred and ninety had at least 1 evaluable time point response and were included in 
the analysis (table 3). Overall, XGEVA achieved objective tumour responses in 71.6% (95% CI 64.6, 77.9) of 
patients (table 3) ) assessed by any of the modalities, with the majority of responses defined by a reduction in 
fluorodeoxyglucose PET activity or increase in density measured in CT/HU, only 25.1 % of the patients had a 
response per RECIST. The median time to response was 3.1 months (95% CI 2.89, 3.65). The median duration 
of response was not estimable (four patients experienced disease progressions following an objective response). 
In 190 subjects evaluable for objective tumour response, 55 subjects had GCTB surgery, out of which 40 
subjects had complete resections.

Effect on pain 
Upon enrolment of 282 patients, in Study 5 cohorts 1 and 2 combined, a clinically meaningful reduction in 
worst pain (i.e., ≥ 2 point decrease from baseline) was reported for 31.4% of patients at risk (i.e. those who had 
a worst pain score of ≥ 2 at baseline) within 1 week of treatment, and ≥ 50% at week 5. These pain 
improvements were maintained at all subsequent evaluations. Baseline pre-treatment analgesic use in cohort 1

and cohort 2 was graded on a seven point scale, where 74.8% of patients reported no or mild analgesic use (i.e. 
analgesic score ≤ 2) and 25.2 % of patients used strong opioids (i.e. analgesic score 3 to 7). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with XGEVA in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with bone metastases 
and subsets of the paediatric population below the age of 12 in the treatment of giant cell tumour of bone (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
In Study 5, XGEVA has been evaluated in a subset of 18 adolescent patients (aged 13-17 years) with giant cell 
tumour of bone who had reached skeletal maturity defined by at least 1 mature long bone (e.g., closed 
epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus) and body weight ≥ 45 kg. An objective response was observed for four 
of six evaluable adolescent patients in an interim analysis of Study 5. An investigator assessment reported that 
all 18 adolescent patients had a best response of stable disease or better (complete response in 2 patients, partial 
response in 8 patients, and stable disease in 8 patients). The European Medicines Agency has deferred the 
obligation to submit the final results of this study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following SC administration, bioavailability was 62%.  
Biotransformation 
Denosumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as native immunoglobulin and is unlikely to 
be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are expected to follow the 
immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
In subjects with advanced cancer, who received With multiple doses of 120 mg every 4 weeks an approximate 
2-fold accumulation in serum denosumab concentrations was observed and steady-state was achieved by 6 
months, consistent with time-independent pharmacokinetics. In subjects with giant cell tumour of bone who 
received 120 mg every 4 weeks with a loading dose on days 8 and 15, steady-state levels were achieved within 
the first month of treatment. Between weeks 9 and 49, median trough levels varied by less than 9%. In subjects 
who discontinued 120 mg every 4 weeks, the mean half-life was 28 days (range 14 to 55 days).

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Benefits  
3.1.1.  Beneficial effects 
The majority of patients included in GCTB studies (200420015 and 20062004) are inoperable or have 
disease where surgery would lead to severe morbidity. The proposed indication is restricted to these 
populations. 
In study 20042015 a beneficial effect was shown by a decrease in both giant cells and neoplastic cells in all 
twenty patients who had biopsies pre and during treatment. In ten of the fifteen patients who were 
evaluated only radiologically a response (as defined by stable disease at week 25) was recorded. In study 
200420015 also a reduction from baseline in bone turn-over markers was shown, however except for 
TRAP-5b they were within reference ranges at baseline. 
Study 20062004, which was primarily a safety study, included two cohorts, Cohort 1 with primary 
unresectable tumours and Cohort 2, where surgery would lead to substantial morbidity. The efficacy 
endpoints where, for the cohorts respectively; time to disease progression and proportion of subjects 
without any surgery at month 6.  
The median time to objective tumour response (Based on any tumour response criteria) was three months.  
At the interims analysis (March 2011) only 4 % (6/169) in cohort 1 had progressive disease and 90% in 
cohort 2 (64/71) had not undergone surgery by month 6. At the data “snap-shot” with cut-off date 20 Aug 
2013 the corresponding numbers were 8.1% (21/258) and 92% (209/228) respectively. Almost 20 % of the 
patients had a complete resection over the study. The majority of which in cohort 2, only 5% had a complete 
resection in cohort 1 and 40% in cohort 2. A total of 34 (13%) of subjects in cohort 1 and 127 (56%) of  
subjects in cohort 2 had on-study surgery.  
A retrospective independent radiographic review of tumour response was performed by a central imaging 
vendor including patients from both studies. CT, MRI and/or PET were provided for 190 (of 303) patients 
where imaging data were available. A response as defined by any of the modalities was recorded in  72 % 
(136/190) of the patients had a response however the majority of responses was seen in  density or reduced 
metabolic activity and only 25% of the patients had a response as defined by RECIST.   
There were indications of clinical benefits such as a reduction in pain, however at baseline the majority of 
patients did not have a strong opioid use, and investigator assessed clinical benefit. 
3.1.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The GCTB is a rare disease which consequently limits the recruitment to the studies; however in this 
application the studies also are uncontrolled which adds to the uncertainty. With regards to the rarity of the 
disease also the validity of literature and historical comparisons is limited.  
The impact of the “stabilisation of the disease” as reported could not be fully evaluated without a control 
group, as the natural course of the inoperable GCTB is not extensively documented and in addition most 
patients included in the current GCTB studies have no relevant treatment options. 
With regards to histological findings only a part of the population in the study 200420015 was sampled, and 
it is impossible to make firm conclusions if the sample is fully representative for the population. The same 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 65/68 
 
  
  
  
holds true for the populations evaluated by different radiological modalities.   The independent review 
radiology assessments were only including 60% of the patients in the studies, analyzes have been made with 
regards to demographic factors and other criteria to confirm the validity of the sample,  however if this is a 
biased selection or a representative population will never be fully elucidated. 
There is an uncertainty if the observed “avoidance of” and “reduced extent of surgery” during the 
observation period is accompanied by a long-term benefit as the follow-up still is limited. Furthermore the 
endpoint “to perform a less morbid surgery” is depending on the investigators classification of surgery at 
inclusion, although this has partly been addressed by an independent review but still the initial definition is 
based on subjectivity.   
In study 20062004 the efficacy was not up-front systematically evaluated, but only as per standard of care, 
obviously the decision to perform radiology could be influenced by different factors.  
Although there is no indication on a rebound effect after discontinuation of denosumab the data is still limited 
and no firm conclusions can be made. After GCTB surgery 6/34 (17.6%) in cohort 1 and 18/127 (14.2%) in 
cohort 2 had disease progression or recurrence after surgery. 
The clinical benefit as assessed by investigators and the reduction in pain is not possible to evaluate without 
a control group in this particular context i.e. inoperable patients with no obvious treatment alternative.  
The number of adolescents is very limited and the results are consequently more uncertain in this 
population. 
3.2.  Risks  
3.2.1.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of denosumab. However the population in this 
indication is younger than previous populations and the duration of treatment is longer which has to be taken 
into consideration. 
Almost all patients experienced adverse events, about 5% led to treatment (or study) discontinuations. 
There are two major safety problems of interest to denosumab in the GCTB population:  
- ONJ, which is an established adverse effect, and  
- a potential impact on malignant transformation, which is part of the natural course of GCTB. 
In total 10 subjects had positively adjudicated ONJ during the treatment phase and one case was reported 
in the follow-up phase, three months post-treatment. Six of the ONJs were ongoing at the last up-date.  
There were six cases reported of malignant transformation, two cases of secondary malignancy of giant cell 
tumour of the bone and four cases of sarcomatous transformation (two of which transformation to malignant 
lung lesions) as per the data snap-shot. Three of those had had previous radiotherapy which is a common 
feature in sarcomatous transformation. So far this seems fairly consistent with the rate in GCTB. 
3.2.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As denosumab treatment can be expected to be continued for several years in the GCTB indications, the 
follow-up, although more substantiated in the last update, is of vital importance to fully understand the 
cumulative incidence of clinically important AEs. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 66/68 
  
  
  
There are reports of ONJ both during and after discontinuation however as the follow-up is limited the 
knowledge on both long-term effects of treatment and after denosumab discontinuation is still uncertain.  
Also with regards to the natural course with malignant transformation in GCTB the follow-up is still too 
limited to rule out an adverse effect, according to data presented malignant transformation occurs typically 
> 1 year after diagnosis ranging 1-8 years in studies. 
The consequences of a reduction in surgery i.e. if not the whole initial tumour containing area is removed is 
not evaluated in the studies however in these indications where the tumour is inoperable this is of less 
importance. 
Also with regards to safety the number of adolescents is too limited to draw firm conclusions, information 
must be based also on adult data. 
3.3.  Balance 
The populations in the GCTB indications have a disease that is inoperable either because of the location and 
size or by severe morbidity consequences by surgery. The positive effect as demonstrated by a stabilisation 
of the disease and reduction in surgery are with regards to the very limited, if any, treatment options and the 
subjectivity inherent in many parameters hard to fully evaluate. However there are complete resections 
reported which is of obvious clinical importance.   
Denosumab treatment can be expected to be continued for several years in the GCTB indications, the 
follow-up, although more substantiated in the last up-date, is of importance to fully understand the effect 
and the cumulative adverse effects.  
A severe adverse event is ONJ which is reported both during and after discontinuation of denosumab, 
however as the follow-up is limited the knowledge on long-term effects both on ONJ but also other events 
after denosumab discontinuation is still uncertain.  
Also with regards to the natural course with malignant transformation in GCTB the follow-up is still too 
limited to rule out an adverse effect. 
3.3.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A complete resection has been performed in about 20% of the patients over the study which, is considered 
of clinical importance, so are the cases where a less morbid surgical procedure could be performed.  
A stabilisation of the disease would also be of clinical importance however as there is no control population 
the true effect is hard to estimate. The tumour responses are mainly reported as density or reduction in 
activity, the radiological responses by RECIST are recorded in about 25% of the patients. The reduced 
activity/ increase in density is consistent with a pathologic response as described by a reduction of both giant 
cells and neoplastic stromal component but the true clinical value could not be estimated. 
The major unfavourable effects are ONJ which is a serious concern as it has adverse impact on quality of life 
and has been described also after discontinuation, of the cases reported during the GCTB studies about half 
are ongoing.  
An increase in malignant transformations would be of a negative importance if an increase compared to the 
natural course of GCTB would be detected. 
EMA/CHMP/468730/2014 
Page 67/68 
 
  
  
  
3.3.2.  Benefit-risk balance 
In the populations described in the indication: giant cell tumour of the bone that is unresectable or where 
surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity the fairly limited effect in number of complete 
resections, but also reductions in surgical morbidity is of clinical importance.  
The stabilising effect is more difficult to evaluate without a control-population. There are also other 
indications of effect as measured by density or activity in the lesions, or a reduction in giant cells or 
neoplastic stroma cells. The clinical value to the patients of these parameters remains uncertain. Also the 
validity of reduction in pain and clinical benefit assessed by investigator is uncertain. 
The major concerns are ONJ during, and after, long-term treatment and an adverse effect on malignant 
progression during or after the study. So far these events are rare and the benefit currently out-weighs 
these concerns, however further follow-up is needed as proposed in the long-term follow-up study.  
3.3.3.  Conclusion 
For the proposed indications with inoperable GCTB or GCTB where surgical resection is likely to result in 
severe morbidity the benefit/risk is considered favourable however with regards to the long duration of 
treatment further follow-up is needed as proposed in the study 20140014. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
changes: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of indication to add treatment of giant cell tumour of bone in adults or skeletally mature 
adolescents. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated 
and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, section 4.6 of the SmPC was updated 
with further guidance regarding pregnancy.  In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor 
editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to update the contact details for the local 
representative in Croatia in the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
Paediatric Data

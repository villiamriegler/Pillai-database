Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi, 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection 
Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Bortezomib Kabi 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Bortezomib Kabi. The RMP details important 
risks of Bortezomib Kabi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Bortezomib Kabi risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Bortezomib Kabi SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients 
on how Bortezomib Kabi should be used.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Bortezomib Kabi is authorised for –  
•  Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
or  dexamethasone  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  progressive  multiple 
myeloma  who  have  received  at  least  1  prior  therapy  and  who  have  already  undergone  or  are 
unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
•  Bortezomib  Fresenius  Kabi  in  combination  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of adult patients with previously  untreated  multiple myeloma who are  not eligible for 
high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
•  Bortezomib  Fresenius  Kabi  in  combination  with  dexamethasone,  or  with  dexamethasone  and 
thalidomide,  is  indicated  for  the  induction  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously  untreated 
multiple  myeloma  who  are  eligible  for  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation. 
•  Bortezomib  Fresenius  Kabi  in  combination  with  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and 
prednisone is indicated for the treatment of  adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell 
lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
It  contains  bortezomib  as  the  active  substance  and  is  available  for  intravenous  or  subcutaneous 
administration. Further information about the evaluation of Bortezomib Fresenius Kabi benefits can be 
found in European public assessment report (EPAR), including in its plain-language summary, available 
on the EMA website, under the medicines. 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bortezomib-fresenius-kabi 
The link will be active once EPAR is published. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Bortezomib Kabi, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Bortezomib Kabi risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
• 
• 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to routine risk minimisation  measures, there are  additional  (proposed)  risk minimization 
measures  for  Medication  /  dispending  errors  (Annex  6,  HCP  education  material).  These  proposed 
measures  are  to  inform  HCPs  of  how  to  correctly  prescribe,  dispense,  reconstitute  and  administer 
bortezomib and how to minimise the occurrence of medication errors. 
Medication/dispensing errors 
In order to prevent medication errors, IV administered SC or vise a versa as well as drug administration 
and dosing errors: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
education of HCPs 
a reconstitution, dosing and administration booklet, 
reconstitution poster, 
a dosing slide rule and 
training of medical representative 
Confusion with administering the incorrect regimens in the transplant induction setting  
• 
proper  training  of  all  Medical  Science  Liaisons  (MSLs)  on  the  different  bortezomib  treatment 
schedules  approved  for  transplant  induction.  MSLs  shall  be  able  to  offer  on-site  training  and 
relevant recommendations 
• 
• 
an  educational  programme  and  specific  tools  for  HCPs  who  are  involved  in  the  prescription  and 
administration of bortezomib combination regimens in the transplant induction 
the schedules, doses and number of cycles for each of the 2 combinations shall be clearly described 
and graphically represented in educational materials and should also remind the need to implement 
the Thalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Program 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. There are routine pharmacovigilance 
activities beyond adverse reactions reporting, aggregate reports, review in PSURs and signal detection 
for following risks: 
• 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
•  Second primary malignancies with BzTD induction therapy 
•  Optic neuropathy and different degrees of visual impairment (up to blindness) 
•  Medication errors 
The routine pharmacovigilance activities include follow-up forms with questionnaires to gather more 
information for cases and close monitoring at regular intervals for early detection and risk minimization. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Bortezomib Kabi is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Bortezomib Kabi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Bortezomib Kabi. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use  of this medicine is possible  based on  available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use 
of the medicine).

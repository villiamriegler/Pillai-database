2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In  February  2002,  the  CPMP  recommended  the  granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  for  the 
medicinal  products  Tracleer  62.5  mg  and  125  mg  film-coated  tablet.  In  April  2009,  Tracleer  32  mg 
quadrisectable dispersible tablets were approved by CHMP as a line extension for patients who cannot 
take the film coated tablets (registration procedure EMEA/H/C/000401/X/0039) 
The active substance of Tracleer is bosentan which is an oral, dual endothelin(ET)-receptor antagonist 
with  affinity  for  both  ETa  and  ETb  receptors.  Bosentan  competes  with  the  binding  of  ET-1  to  both 
receptors.

The current indication for the 3 strengths is: 
Treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and  symptoms  in 
patients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: 
• 
• 
• 
Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II (see section 5.1). 
Tracleer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and 
ongoing digital ulcer disease (see section 5.1). 
The current SMPCs include recommendations for pediatric patients above 2 years of age informing on 
pharmacokinetics  results  from  PK  studies  AC-052-356/BREATHE-3  and  AC-052-365/FUTURE-1  which 
showed that bosentan plasma concentrations in children were on average lower than in adult patients and 
were not increased by increasing the dose of Tracleer above 2 mg/kg body weight twice daily (based on 
PK results as described in section 5.2 of the SMPC). Subsequently, section 4.2 of the SMPC states that in 
children above 2 years of age, the dose of 2 mg/kg b.i.d. is recommended as starting and maintenance 
doses since higher doses are considered unlikely to be more effective while higher rate of undesirable 
effects cannot be excluded (see below for background in pediatrics). In children below 2 years of age, the 
SMPC states that there is only limited clinical experience in pediatric patients below 2 years of age.  
The main safety concerns with bosentan relate to its effect in decreasing the haemoglobin, hepatoxicity 
and potential teratogenicity. 
In April 2014, Actelion submitted a Type II variation to amend the Product information with the aim to 
extend the indication to children above 3 months of age: 
The wording claimed for paediatric patients in section 4.1 is: 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of symptomatic PAH in paediatric patients aged from 3 months to 18 years old (see 
section 5.1).” 
The posology claimed by the MAH for children 3 months to 18 years is worded as “2 mg/kg twice daily 
morning and evening up to a maximum dose of 125 mg twice daily”.   
Further amendments in relation to paediatrics are also claimed by the MAH in Sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.8., 5.1. 
5.2. and 5.3. of the SMPC and accordingly in the patient leaflet : 
-  Amend  the  posology  and  information  in  PAH  children  but  no  dosing  recommendation  for 
neonates with PPHN, 
-  Update the undesirable effects section to reflect the additional safety information obtained in 
paediatric studies, 
-  Update the  pharmacodynamic  properties  to  include summaries  of  the  completed  paediatric 
studies not included in the current SmPC, 
-  Update the section on pharmacokinetic properties with the PK data from the newly submitted 
paediatric studies FUTURE 3 and FUTURE 4,  
-  Update the nonclinical safety data to include information on the toxicity studies conducted in 
juvenile rats. 
2.2.  Background information regarding paediatric data with bosentan 
In 2002, since no data had been initially provided to document neither the pharmacokinetic (PK) nor the 
clinical use in children and patients with low body weight, the SMPC, section 4.2  initially stated  
“Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 12 years have not been established.”  and “There is 
limited experience in patients with a body weight below 40 kg.” 
In  February  2003,  the  MAH  provided  the  paediatric  pharmacokinetic  study  BREATHE-3  (AC-052-356) 
studying 19 children less than 15 years and less than 40 kg. This study showed a lower systemic exposure 
in young children using film coated tablets 2 mg/kg b.i.d as compared to the exposure in adults treated 
with  125  mg  b.i.d.  Thus  the  PK  information  was  added  in  the  section  4.2  in  order  to  inform  on  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 7/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specificity of the pharmacokinetics in children with special attention to the lack of data to establish the 
optimal dose in this population. 
Indeed, the scarcity of the clinical paediatric study (the sole clinical study being BREATHE-3) did not allow 
to establish the optimal dose in children less than 15 years bearing in mind that, in one hand, a lower 
systemic exposure could lead to a suboptimal treatment in children (as compared to adult) and, on the 
other hand, that safety concerns could not be excluded when the dose would be increased to reach a 
higher effect.  
In  May  2008,  the  MAH  applied  for  a  line  extension  for  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablets 
(EMEA/H/C/401/X/0039) based on clinical data focusing on paediatrics including: a new paediatric PK 
study:  AC-052-365  (FUTURE-1)  using  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  and  the    preliminary  results  from  its 
open-label extension study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2) (Cut-off 1 March 2008). 
FUTURE-1 included 36 paediatric PAH patients 2 to 11 years old and showed no difference in AUC after 
administration of doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg b.i.d. and available paediatric pharmacokinetic data showed 
that bosentan plasma concentrations in children were on average lower than in adult patients again and 
were not increased by increasing the dose of Tracleer above 2 mg/kg body weight twice daily.  
These short term PK studies suggested that children were stabilised (based on WHO functional status and 
hemodynamics) with 2 mg/kg for short term periods (12 weeks maximum in BREATHE-3 including 19 
patients) and maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg in the available longer term data (FUTURE-1/2). 
These studies had limitations as they were short terms, uncontrolled, conducted in a limited number of 
patients, of whom a significant part was receiving concomitant epoprostenol (25% in FUTURE-1).  
From  an  efficacy  point  of  view,  the  observed  plateau  in  systemic  concentration  would  suggest  that 
increasing the dose of bosentan beyond 2 mg/kg in paediatric patients in a b.i.d. regimen will unlikely 
result in any increased exposure to bosentan and subsequent increased effect on pulmonary vasculature.  
No  clinical  study  primarily  well-designed  for  efficacy/safety  assessment  was  performed  in  children 
especially  comparing  the  two  maintenance  regimen  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  versus  4  mg/kg  b.i.d.  on 
safety/efficacy grounds.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that information on these specific results were warranted in the SmPC 
(EMEA/H/C/401/X/0039 and EMEA/H/C/401/X/41) but further long term safety and clinical data should 
be collected in paediatric patients. The CHMP agreed on the proposal of the MAH for these data to be 
collected  in  a  Systematic  Review.  The  Systematic  Review  uses  aggregated  data  from  a  number  of 
prospective disease registries initiated to study the disease course and long-term outcomes of PAH in 
children and adolescents in current real-world clinical settings:  
• Tracking Outcomes and Practice in Paediatric Pulmonary Hypertension (TOPP), an international 
prospective disease registry 
• The French paediatric PAH registry (FR). 
• The Dutch national paediatric PAH Registry (NL). 
• REVEAL (Registry to EVvaluate Early And Long-term PAH Disease Managment), an American 
PAH disease registry including both adult and pediatric PAH patients.  
The systematic review protocol (AC-052-516) “Disease characteristics and outcomes for PAH in children 
and adolescents in real world settings: systematic review of four prospective observational registries” was 
submitted by the MAH on 01 July 2009. The systemic review started on 15 October 2009. As a comment, 
the  MAH  was  requested  to  consider  ways  to  follow-up  PAH  children  up  to  puberty  in  order  to  get 
information on sexual maturity.  
As follow-up measure (FUM 062), the MAH has provided 4 annual reports of systemic review of the four 
registries. Respectively, Rapporteur’s assessment reports were circulated on May 2011, May 2012, June 
2013, and October 2014. The fourth annual report has been provided by the MAH during this procedure 
upon request.  
In  October  2010,  the  MAH  submitted  Study  AC-052-116  comparing  the  bioavailability  of  the  32  mg 
dispersible  tablet  and  the  marketed  film-coated  tablet  in  healthy  male  adults  as  a  follow-up  measure 
(FUM-061)  requested  by  CHMP  following  approval  of  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablets.  This  study 
showed that the 62.5 mg film coated tablet and the 32 mg dispersible tablet could not be considered 
bioequivalent as lower bioavailability was observed with the 32 mg dispersible tablet. Results of this study 
were  included  in  section  5.2.  of  the  SMPCs  of  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  under  subheading 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015

“Comparison between formulations”. Recommendations were included in the SmPC for the dispersible 
tablets to be used only in patients not able to use film coated tablets. 
Meanwhile, a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for bosentan was agreed by the EMA under Article 8 of 
the Paediatric Regulation (EMEA-000425-PIP02-10-M04). The latest modification acceptance from EMA is 
dated on 29 April 2013.  
The PIP that was agreed by PDCO consisted of the 6 following measures : 
Quality :  
Measure 1: Study on nasogastric tube administration of the bosentan dispersible tablet. 
Non-clinical: 
Measure 2: 24 days dose-range-finding toxicity study in juvenile rats. 
Measure 3: 94 days toxicity study in juvenile rats. 
Measure 4: Safety and efficacy study in a model of chronic pulmonary hypertension in newborn sheep.  
Clinical: 
Measure 5: Open-label, randomised multicentre, multiple dose trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety 
of bosentan in children from 3 months to less than 12 years of age with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
(PAH) (so cold FUTURE 3). 
Measure  6:  Double  blind,  randomised  multicentre,  add-on,  placebo  controlled,  trial  to  evaluate 
pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, of bosentan in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of 
the newborn (PPHN). 
A partial waiver was granted for the treatment of PAH. This waiver applied to infants aged from 28 days 
to less than 3 months and to adolescents aged from 12 years to less than 18 years based on consideration 
agreed by PDCO that “a diagnosis of PAH cannot be consistently made before the age of 3 months and 
that adolescent PAH patients were included in the pivotal clinical trials with bosentan as well as in the first 
paediatric study [BREATHE-3].” 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As part of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan, the MAH  committed to conduct a study on nasogastric 
tube administration of the Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet. The goal of this study was to explore the 
acceptability of the Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet as an age-appropriate formulation for infants and 
children  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH),  and  for  neonates  with  persistent  pulmonary 
hypertension  of  the  newborn  (PPHN),  for  whom  the  administration  of  bosentan  via  an  orogastric  or 
nasogastric tube would be necessary.  
The study investigated the administration of the Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet via a nasogastric tube 
in vitro for doses ranging from 4 mg to 16 mg (covering the anticipated needs for paediatric patients with 
body weights from 2–8 kg at a dose per administration of 2 mg/kg body weight). The objective of the 
study  was  to  provide  data  on  the  accuracy  of  the  dosage  by  nasogastric  tube  administration  of  the 
Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet. 
For  each  dose,  an  amount  of  Tracleer  32  mg  (one quarter  tablet,  one  half  tablet)  was  dispersed  in  a 
volume of water. A volume, depending on the dose, was collected with a graduated syringe to administer 
through the nasogastric tube. To control the content of bosentan, for each dose, which is delivered, the 
dispersion was collected at the end of the tube to be analyzed - tests have been performed in duplicate. 
All mean values obtained were within 79–96% of the targeted delivered dose (see table hereafter). The 
Applicant explains there may be some losses of substance during the sample preparation as error for 
dividing  the  quadrisected  Tracleer  32  mg  dispersible  tablet,  the  non-homogeneous  dispersion  and 
delivery through the syringe and tubing as precision of syringe, potential adsorption on plastic materials.  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 9/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH has estimated that approximately 10% loss of substance would be expected when delivering the 
Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet via an orogastric or nasogastric tube. 
Consequently, the MAH states that to compensate for the loss of substance observed in the study, the 
patient’s body weight should always be rounded up to the next 0.5Kg step when calculating the dose. 
2.3.2.  Discussion 
The Applicant has provided an in vitro study testing different doses (4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 mg) from one 
quarter or one half tablet dispersed in appropriate volume of water.in order to know the accuracy of the 
dosage by nasogastric tube administration of Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet.  
Experimental tests have been performed in duplicate leading to a high variability of data. Even if, a 10% 
loss of substance is expected, the results presented are not justified since all mean values obtained were 
within 79–96% of the targeted delivered dose. In this context, data are considered as non-sufficient to 
evaluate the accuracy of the dosage. Further data (more than duplicate) should be provided in order to 
demonstrate the accuracy of the dosage. 
The Applicant described that the 10% loss of the active substance could be  due to the subdivision of 
tablets,  the  non-homogeneous  dispersion  of  the  tablet,  the  precision  of  the  syringe  as  well  as  the 
potential  adsorption  of  the  substance  on  the  plastic  materials.  However,  data  provided  do  not  allow 
confirming that estimation of approximately 10% loss of the substance.  
The MAH provided further clarification mentioned below:  
A  second  study  performed  in  2011,  investigated  the  administration  of  the  Tracleer  32 mg  dispersible 
tablet via a nasogastric tube for doses ranging from 6 mg to 12 mg.  
In  this  study  the  volume  of  water  in  which  the  dispersible  tablet  or  sub-part  of  dispersible  tablet  is 
dispersed was reduced to 4–5 mL (instead of 8 mL in the previous study). In addition, the administered 
volume was reduced to 1.5 mL. These lower administered volumes were considered to be more in line 
with common practices. Triplicate testing was performed to increase the robustness of the methodology.

This  additional  study  confirmed  that  the  administration  of  bosentan  dispersible  tablets  32 mg  via  a 
nasogastric  tube  produced  variable  results  (average  standard  deviation  of  approximately  10%). 
Moreover, accuracy of the delivered dose was not achieved as the recovery rate deviated substantially 
from the target (on average, 80% of the dose was delivered), as shown in  
Assessment report

Figure 1. In addition, two administrations failed (50–60% of dose delivered) due to clogging in the tubes, 
representing approximately 10% of the experiments.  
The higher concentration of the suspension (tablets are dispersed in 4–5 mL of water in the second study 
instead of 8 mL in the first study) might explain this increase in losses and clogging within the tubing.

Summary of results from administration via nasogastric tubes  
According to the MAH, to overcome these losses and avoid clogging, an excess of 20% of the 
delivered dose by nasogastric tube administration would need to be recommended, as well as 
the use of tubes with an inner diameter no narrower than 1.5 mm. This may raise difficulties in 
usual practice. 
Based  on  these  results,  the  MAH  withdrew  the  proposed  recommendation  to  administer 
Tracleer dispersible tablets through a nasogastric tube.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion 
In summary, the accuracy of the delivered dose is not achieved when Tracleer dispersible 
tablets is dispersed in appropriate volume of water and administered per a nasogastric tube 
due to losses and clogging, notably. Based on the results presented above, an excess of 20% 
of the dose should be required. The Applicant explained that the lack of accuracy could be due 
in part to the precision of the syringe (graduation) and potential adsorption of the substance on 
its surface and on the tubing might also be a cause for loss of substance. However no data are 
provided to support this explanation.  
Nevertheless, as the PPHN indication is not claimed and as the MAH withdrew the 
recommendation regarding the administration of Tracleer dispersible tablets through a 
nasogastric tube, the issue can be considered solved. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Three nonclinical studies were conducted to support the paediatric development of bosentan: 
an efficacy study in a model of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), and 
toxicity studies in juvenile rats (a dose-range finding study followed by a pivotal study). 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 13/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Since endothelin-1 (ET-1) is elevated in neonates with severe PPHN, treatment with bosentan, a dual ETA 
and ETB receptor antagonist, was expected to cause pulmonary dilation. To support this hypothesis, an 
experimental model of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) was used. This model 
has been established through partial ligation of the ductus arteriosus (DA) in utero in late-gestation foetal 
sheep, i.e. between 120-128 days of gestation (term=147 days). This procedure is known to cause a 
marked elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at delivery despite ventilation with high fraction 
of inspired oxygen (FiO2), thereby mimicking severe human PPHN. 
Practically, nine animals were used in this study, 5 with chronic DA ligation (PPHN) and 4 controls. When 
surgery was performed, catheters and a flow transducer were placed in the left pulmonary artery (LPA) to 
allow  the  administration  of  bosentan  to  foetal  lambs  and  measurement  of  various  physiological 
responses. The range of gestational ages at the time of study was 130-142, 131-140 days for control and 
PPHN group, respectively. Control and PPHN animals were studied between 3-8 and 3-12 days after foetal 
surgery, respectively. The haemodynamic effects of acute infusion of bosentan (10 or 50 mg over 30 min 
into the LPA), were assessed by measuring the following physiologic responses in foetal lambs: mean 
pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), LPA blood flow (Qipa), mean 
aortic pressure (mAoP), heart rate, and arterial blood gases at baseline and during the infusion period.  
There were no changes in heart rate, pH, PO2 or pCO2 in control and PPHN animals treated with bosentan. 
As shown in Table 2, bosentan lowered PVR by 25% (p<0.02) vs. baseline in PPHN animals and tended to 
decrease PVR in the normal foetus (control) by 16% (p=0.47). 
Table 2: hemodynamics in control and PPHN animals at baseline and after bosentan 
administration (mean±SEM) 
* p<0.02 versus baseline 
The applicant concluded that pulmonary arterial infusion of bosentan caused pulmonary vasodilation 
without adversely affecting systemic haemodynamics in experimental PPHN, suggesting that bosentan 
could provide therapeutic benefit in children with PPHN. 
2.4.3.  Toxicology 
As specified before, a dose-range finding juvenile toxicity study in rats followed by a pivotal study were 
performed  to  support  the  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  of  bosentan  to  the  treatment  of 
symptomatic PAH in paediatric patients aged 3 months and above. The results of these two studies are 
summarised below.

2.4.3.2.  Pivotal juvenile toxicity study  
•  Methods 
The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  effects  of  bosentan  on  growth  and  development  of  the 
neonatal/juvenile Han Wistar rat. 
Rat pups were treated orally once daily by gavage beginning at 4 days of age. The within litter design was 
used.  Each  litter  contained  8  pups  and  one  male  and  one  female  pup  was  used  per  dose  group, 
respectively. After weaning the treated animals were group housed by dose group and sex. Dams (F0 
Generation) were not treated; they only fostered the juvenile rats. 
The study was divided into three subsets: histopathology (subset I), behavior and fertility (subset II), and 
toxicokinetic (subset III). Subset I and III were administered until 69 days of age and subset II until 
mating (at least 84 days old). Subset I and II consisted of 20, and subset III of 9 litters. In parallel to 
subset  I,  4  control  litters  were  treated  (total  16  males  and  16  females)  with  the  vehicle  only 
(between-litter-design)  to supplement the  control  group  with  histology  information  due  to  the lack  of 
historical control data at the corresponding age. 
Mortality,  clinical  signs,  food  consumption  and  body  weight  were  recorded  in  all  subsets.  Food 
consumption was recorded after weaning, from 21 days of age on. 
Subset I animals were used for clinical laboratory investigations, long bone length, organ weights and 
histopathology and on day 21 and 70 post-partum (n = 10 per group/sex/day). 
Subset II animals were used for recording developmental indices, behavioral tests and fertility incl. estrus 
length, mating performance, reproduction data, and seminology and spermatid count.

Subset III animals were used for toxicokinetic evaluations on days 4, 21 and 69 post-partum. On day 4 
post-partum, blood samples were collected at 1 h, 3 h or 6 h after application by decapitation, from pups, 
which were selected for culling. On days 21 and 69, each pup was sampled at two time points sublingually 
under isoflurane anaesthesia.

2.4.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The PIP specified that a “PK/safety and efficacy study in a model of chronic pulmonary hypertension in 
newborn sheep” should be performed. Originally, a study was performed to assess the effects of oral 
bosentan at the time of cesarean section delivery of newborn sheep that had undergone surgical ligation 
of the ductus arteriosus (DA) in utero 7-10 days before delivery. However, no measureable effects with 
oral administration was detected due to problems with absorption after c-section delivery and the need 
for continuous anaesthesia and sedation to the lamb at the time of birth and throughout the acute study 
period  (which  further  impairs  Gl  motility  and  absorption).  Therefore,  the  study  detailed  above  was 
conducted  to  check  whether  lack  of  efficacy  was  due  to  the  route  of  administration  (oral  versus 
intravenous).  The  technique  used,  i.e.  intravenous  dosing  of  foetal  lambs  during  the  development  of 
pulmonary hypertension prior to birth, was already used in the past by different scientific teams as argued 
by the MAH, including an ETA receptor antagonist. 
The results of the juvenile study showed that infusions of bosentan induce pulmonary vasodilatation in 
chronically-prepared foetal lambs. However, the clinical relevance of this study may be viewed as limited 
since  the  pulmonary  function  of  newborn  lambs  was  not  reproduced  in  this  experimental  model.  In 
addition,  further  studies  are  needed  to  assess  the  effects  of  more  prolonged  infusions  after  birth  of 
animals with PPHN and to determine how the response to bosentan compares with the response to other 
agents, especially inhaled NO (iNO), and whether bosentan therapy can augment inhaled NO-induced 
pulmonary  vasodilatation  or  blunt  the  effects  of  rebound  after  iNO  withdrawal.  Importantly,  clinical 
studies  in  children  with  PPNH  do  not  show  any  efficacy  of  bosentan  associated  to  iNO  compared  to 
“placebo” group (only treated with iNO). 
The major findings reported in juvenile rats were reduced body weight, increased heart weight, reduced 
long  bone  length,  and  reduced  testis  weight  associated  with  reduced  number  of  sperms  and  reduced 
epididymides weights (only observed at high dose).  
The effects reported above were only observed at mid and high dose levels, i.e. at ≥45 mg/kg/d. Indeed, 
no effect was noted at 15 mg/kg/d. In addition, no effect on developmental indices, clinical pathology, 
histology, or reproductive performance, was reported. The reduced long bone length was in accord with 
the reduced body weights as: 
- 
- 
the long bone length and body weights were reduced on day 21 post-partum but not on day 69 
post-partum in males, 
the long bone length and body weights were reduced on day 21 and 69 post-partum in females. 
The MAH argued that no new target organ toxicity was detected compared to rat toxicity studies in adult 
animals. However, effects on testis and heart weights (observed only at high dose) were not reported in 
adult rats. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 17/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Heart-weight 
As mentioned by the MAH, a treatment-related effect on heart weight cannot be excluded although there 
was no histopathological heart finding (the reported increase in heart weight may indicate an increased 
workload).  Some  effects  were  reported  on  the  male  reproductive  tissues  (decreased  testis  and 
epididymides weights, reduced number of sperms, decreased epididymal sperm count). Unfortunately, 
neither discussed the potential causes underlying these findings nor their clinical relevance. It should be 
noted  that  effects  on  testis  were  observed  with  other  molecules  of  this  pharmacological  class  (e.g. 
macitentan and ambrisentan) in adult rats.  Corresponding findings were reported in SmPC sections 5.3 
and 4.6. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH that only the relative heart weights (to body and brain weights) was 
increased and not the absolute relative heart weights. However, relative heart weights increases were not 
only observed at that dose (135 mg/kg bw/d.) as this was also reported in females at the dose of 45 
mg/kg bw/d. on day 21 post-partum (pp). Therefore, the NOAEL for females at day 21 pp is 15 mg/kg 
bw/d. and corresponding safety margins for children under 2 years and above 2 years are, 21 and 19, 
respectively, which are still considered acceptable. 
Considering that only relative heart weights were increased at the top dose (135 mg/ kg bw/d.) and not 
absolute heart weights, no histopathological findings were observed, safety margins could be considered 
acceptable, increased relative heart weights in the juvenile toxicity study in rats is no more considered as 
a concern and the CHMP agreed for not amending the RMP with heart findings reported in the juvenile rat 
toxicity study. 
• 
Testicular toxicity 
The MAH states that "testicular toxicity of other endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) typically includes 
tubular  dilatation  up  to  subchronic  treatment  leading  to  tubular  atrophy  after  chronic  treatment"  and 
considers  that  neither  tubular  dilatation,  nor  tubular  atrophy  was  observed  with  bosentan  and  then 
considers that these effects are only related to a class-effect of ERAs. 
The CHMP did not agree with the MAH and concluded that there is enough evidence showing testicular 
effects with bosentan itself in animals considering: 
- 
- 
decreased absolute weights of testes and epididymis, and reduced number of sperm in epididymis 
in the newly provided  juvenile rat toxicity study conducted with bosentan, 
slight increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy (effect also observed with other ERAs) in 
a toxicity study in rats after 2 years of treatment with  bosentan (as mentioned by the MAH in the 
new labelling proposed in section 5.3 of the SmPC), 
Additionally,  the  MAH  has  provided  the  study  report  of  a  clinical  study  investigating  the  effects  of 
bosentan treatment on testicular function in male PAH patients (Study AC-052-402). In this study, 8 out 
of 24 male patients treated had a decreased sperm concentration from baseline of at least 42% after 3 or 
6 months of treatment with bosentan. Two of these 8 patients showed a sperm concentration lower than 
15×106/ml which is the lower reference limit of sperm concentration, for the fifth centiles (with 95th 
percent confidence intervals), generated from men whose partners had time to pregnancy ≤ 12 months, 
according to WHO (2010)1 
In  conclusion,  based  on  the  results  observed  in  the  juvenile  rat  toxicity  study,  and  on  the  data  from 
clinical study AC-052-402 in humans to assess testicular effects of bosentan, it cannot be excluded that 
bosentan  has  an  effect  on  spermatogenesis  in  human.  Upon  request  from  the  PRAC/CHMP,  testicular 
disorders and male infertility and decrease of sperm count are included as an important potential risk and 
important identified risk, respectively in the RMP and sections 4.6 (fertility) and 5.3 of the SmPC are 
amended as follows:

decreased  sperm  concentration  from  baseline  of  at  least  42%  after  3  or  6  months  of 
treatment with bosentan. Based on these findings and preclinical data, it cannot be excluded 
that bosentan may have a detrimental effect on spermatogenesis in men. In male children , a 
long term impact on fertility after treatment with bosentan cannot be excluded.  
section 5.3 of the SmPC:  
[….] 
Development of testicular tubular atrophy and impaired fertility has been linked with chronic 
administration of endothelin receptor antagonists in rodents. 
In fertility studies in male and female rats at plasma concentrations 21 and 43 times, respectively, the 
expected therapeutic level in humans,  no effects on sperm count, motility and viability, or on mating 
performance  or  fertility  were  observed  at  exposures  that  were  21  and  43  times  the  expected 
therapeutic level in humans, respectively; nor was there any adverse effect on the development of 
the pre-implantation embryo or on implantation. 
Slightly increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy was observed in rats given bosentan 
orally at doses as low as 125 mg/kg/ day (about 4 times the maximum recommended human 
dose (MRHD) and the lowest doses  tested) for two years  but  not at doses  as  high as 1500 
mg/kg/day (about 50 times the MRHD) for 6 months. In a juvenile rat toxicity study, where 
rats  were  treated  from  Day4  post  partum  up  to  adulthood,  decreased  absolute  weights  of 
testes and epididymides, and reduced number of sperm in epididymides were observed after 
weaning.  The  NOAEL  was  21  times  (at  Day  21  post  partum)  and  2.3  times  (Day  69  post 
partum) the human therapeutic exposure, respectively. 
However,  no  effects  on  general  development,  growth,  sensory,  cognitive  function  and 
reproductive  performance  were  detected  at  7  (males)  and  19  (females)  times  the  human 
therapeutic exposure at Day 21 post partum. At adult age (Day 69 post partum) no effects of 
bosentan were detected at 1.3 (males) and 2.6 (females) times the therapeutic exposure in 
children with PAH.  
Toxicokinetics was evaluated on PND4, 21, and 69. The MAH specified that bosentan does not induce CYP 
in  rat  based  on  toxicokinetic  data  available  and  therefore  suggested  that  only  differences  in  enzyme 
maturation  is  involved  for  bosentan  metabolism  of  adult  versus  juvenile  rats.    As  shown  in  Table  4, 
exposure levels were higher on PND21 than on PND69, which the CHMP considered probably due to in part 
the  maturation  of  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  bosentan  and  therefore,  an  age  effect  on 
kinetics is observed. 
The MAH determined safety margins ranging from 7 to 8, taking into account exposure levels reached in 
juvenile rats and in children below and above 2 years of age. More precisely, an exposure level of 65,500 
ng.h/mL  in  juvenile  rats  was  used,  and  obtained  by  averaging  sex  combined  animal  data  on  PND21 
([59,700+168,000]/2=113,850  ng.h/mL)  and  on  PND69  ([11800+22500]/2=17150  ng.h/mL), 
respectively – please see Table 4. This is not endorsed by the CHMP. As shown in Table 4, exposure levels 
decreased over time and were 6.8 and 19 fold higher in juvenile rats and 1.3- to 2.9-fold higher in adult 
rats compared to children. Therefore, it is concluded that the course of exposure needs to be taken into 
consideration for the safety margins which is considered weak. 
In conclusion, the labelling of the SmPC (section 4.6 and 5.3) are amended as above mentioned. 
2.4.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  submitted  non-clinical  data,  no  major  concern  was  raised  regarding  juvenile  toxicity. 
However, reduced testis weight associated with reduced number of sperms and reduced epididymides 
weights were observed with bosentan (only observed at high dose).  These effects were not observed 
adult toxicity studies. Of note, effects on testis were observed in adult toxicity studies with other ERAs 
(i.e. macitentan and ambrisentan) and the relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.  
The SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3. were updated to reflect the above findings and the RMP is updated to 
reflect testicular disorders and male infertility as an important potential risk.

pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Investigators  /  centers  and  countries. 45 expert pediatric centers in 20 countries across Europe, 
North America, Latin America, Australia, Asia, and Africa 
Period of trial. 8 March 2011 to 19 August 2013 
Study design/ Objective 
The primary objective was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the dispersible tablet formulation 
of bosentan at doses of 2 mg/kg twice daily (b.i.d.) and 2 mg/kg three times daily (t.i.d.) in children with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) from ≥ 3 months to < 2 years of age and from 2 years to < 12 
years of age. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of bosentan in children with 
PAH from ≥ 3 months to < 2 years of age and from 2 years to < 12 years of age. 
This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, multiple dose (two dose regimens) Phase 3 
study in children aged ≥ 3 months to < 12 years of age. At least 16 patients in the study were required 
to be below 2 years of age. 
Following the screening period (4 weeks’ duration), patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral 
doses  of  bosentan  as  dispersible  tablets  of  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  or  2  mg/kg  t.i.d.,  stratified  for  baseline 
bosentan treatment as well as other PAH-specific treatments. At randomization, bosentan dosage was 
adjusted according to the patient’s body weight. The treatment period lasted for 24 weeks. 
Number of patients included 
64 patients were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. and 2 mg/kg t.i.d. 
Patients were required to be ≥ 3 months and < 12 years of age. 
64 patients were actually randomized to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (n=33) and 2 mg/kg t.i.d. (n=31). Of 
the 64 randomized patients, 21 were < 2 years (10 b.i.d., 11 t.i.d.) and 43 were ≥ 2 years of age (23 
b.i.d., 20 t.i.d.).

Trial  drug  dose  /  Route  /  Regimen  /  Duration  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  dispersed  for  oral 
administration (b.i.d. or t.i.d.) 
Criteria for pharmacokinetic evaluation 
The  main  PK  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  daily  exposure  to  bosentan,  i.e.,  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  over  a  period  of  24 h  (AUC0-24),  and  calculated  as  a  multiple  of  the 
exposure over a dosing interval (AUCτ), 3 × AUCτ and 2 × AUCτ for t.i.d. and b.i.d regimens, respectively. 
Other PK endpoints were maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of bosentan, time to reach the maximum 
plasma concentration (tmax) of bosentan, and daily exposure (AUC0-24), Cmax, tmax of bosentan metabolites 
(Ro 47-8634, Ro 48-5033, Ro 64-1056). 
Statistical methods 
No formal hypothesis testing was defined for this study. Analyses of PK endpoints were performed for the 
overall population and by age groups < 2 years or ≥ 2 years. 
The  statistical  analyses  of  the  PK  parameters  were  performed  using  the  All-randomized  set  (= 
intention-to-treat population) and using the PK set. In the analysis of primary interest performed using 
the All-randomized set, it was noted that this analysis set included subjects who did not have reliable PK 
profiles  due  to  protocol  deviations.  Therefore,  to  reflect  the  PK  properties  of  this  population  more 
correctly, all PK analyses were also performed using the PK set. 
All subjects did not receive an exact dose of 2 mg/kg, as the smallest dosage unit was 8 mg (quarter 
tablet), therefore AUC0-24 and Cmax were corrected to the target dose of 2 mg/kg (AUC0-24C and CmaxC). All 
AUC and Cmax values were assumed to be log-normally distributed. The comparison of the b.i.d. and the 
t.i.d. dosing regimens of bosentan was based on the ratio of geometric means of the daily exposures 
(AUC0-24C)  and  of  CmaxC  of  bosentan  and  its  metabolites:  test  treatment  (t.i.d.):  reference  treatment 
(b.i.d.) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The linear fixed-effects model with dosing regimen as 
fixed effect was used for generation of 95% CIs for the ratios of the geometric means. The influence of the 
WHO FC, body weight, gender and age at study entry (baseline covariates) on the main analysis was 
assessed in post hoc sensitivity analyses. The linear fixed-effects model used for the main analysis was 
used to produce baseline covariate-adjusted treatment effect estimates. 
Patient disposition 
Of 87 screened patients, 64 were randomized 1:1 to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (N=33) and 2 mg/kg t.i.d. 
(N=31) treatment groups (hereafter referred to as b.i.d. and t.i.d.). Of the 64 randomized patients, 21 
were < 2 years (10 b.i.d., 11 t.i.d.) and 43 were ≥ 2 years of age (23 b.i.d., 20 t.i.d.). A total of 4 patients 
(2 each in b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups) discontinued the study treatment prematurely either due to AEs (n=3) 
or by withdrawal of consent (n=1). Of the 4 patients who discontinued study drug prematurely, 3 were < 
2 years of age. All 64 randomized patients completed the study as per protocol. No patient was lost to 
follow-up. 
All 64 randomized patients were included in the All-treated set. The Per-protocol set included 56 of the 
randomized patients (87.5%), and the Per-protocol PK set (hereafter referred to as PK set) included 58 of 
the  randomized  patients  (90.6%).  Finally,  PK  data  in  children  less  than  2  years  were  available  for  9 
children from the b.i.d. and 8 children from the t.i.d. group (less than one year was n= 2 in b.i.d. group 
and 2 in the t.i.d group). 
2.5.2.1.1.  Pharmacokinetics results 
The study compared the PK properties of two dosing regimens of bosentan: t.i.d. (as 3 × 2 mg/kg per 
day) vs b.i.d. (as 2 × 2 mg/kg per day), with b.i.d. as the dosing regimen of reference. 
The  PK  profiles  for  bosentan  and  its  three  metabolites  Ro  47-8634,  Ro  48-5033,  and  Ro  64-1056  at 
steady-state were comparable for the t.i.d. and b.i.d. dosing regimens. PK profiles of bosentan for both 
dosing regimens were characterized by rapid absorption, with a median tmax of 3 h. 
Taking  into  account  the  inter-subject  variability  and  despite  an  observed  15%  lower  daily  exposure 
(AUC0-24C) and a 29% lower CmaxC with t.i.d. vs b.i.d. dosing regimens, the exposure to bosentan was 
considered to be comparable with both dosing regimens in the overall pediatric population, as the 95 % 
CI of the geometric mean ratio included 1.00.

Summary  of  main  statistical  analysis  of  the  effect  of  the  dosing  regimen  (t.i.d.  vs 
b.i.d.) on bosentan PK parameters, PK set: 
The point estimates of the geometric mean ratios of AUC0-24C and CmaxC for bosentan and its metabolites 
were comparable across the age groups, and the systemic exposure to bosentan was also comparable 
between patients aged < 2 years and those ≥ 2 years, and this was observed for both b.i.d. and t.i.d. 
dosing regimens. 
Summary  of  the  effect  of  the  dosing  regimen  (t.i.d.  vs  b.i.d.)  on  bosentan  PK 
parameters per age group, PK set: 
Overall, the study showed that t.i.d. dosing in the pediatric PAH population did not increase the exposure 
to bosentan compared to b.i.d. dosing.  
2.5.2.1.2.  Conclusion on Pharmacokinetics results  
The  results  of  the  study  FUTURE  3  showed  that  the  overall  daily  systemic  exposure  to  bosentan  for 
children with PAH appears to be almost similar with both dosing regimen (b.i.d. vs t.i.d.) in both groups 
of age. These results confirmed that an increase in dose frequency of bosentan from 2 mg/kg b.i.d. to 2 
mg/kg t.i.d. did not result in increased daily systemic exposure in pediatric PAH patients. 
In PAH study FUTURE-3, PK parameters of bosentan and its metabolites in patients < 2 years appeared 
consistent with those in patients ≥ 2 years. However, due to the limited PK data in children below 2 years 
of age (b.i.d. n=9 ; t.i.d. n= 8), pharmacokinetics remains not well characterised in this age category.  
The MAH justification regarding the difficulty in enrolling PAH children in the study FUTURE 3 less than 2 
years in relation to the low frequency of the disease in this age group is acceptable, however due to the 
very limited number of children less than one year (i.e.  n= 2 in b.i.d. group and n= 2 in the t.i.d. group) 
and high variability in PK results (see also PK results from FUTURE 4 study below), no clear information 
can be made on this age group of less than 1 year. In summary, the section 5.2. of the SmPC has been 
updated accordingly. 
2.5.2.1.3.  Population PK analysis 
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis of bosentan in pediatric patients with PAH was performed 
on data from study AC-052-373, pediatric FormUlation of bosenTan in pUlmonary arterial hypertension 
(FUTURE 3), a prospective study with bosentan in children with PAH investigating the pharmacokinetics of 
2 mg/kg b.i.d. versus three times per day (t.i.d.).

The objectives of the PopPK analysis were: 
1.  To describe population PK characteristics (i.e., population-typical PK parameters) of bosentan and 
its  metabolites  (Ro  47-8634,  Ro  48-5033,  Ro  64-1056),  including  inter-  and  intra-individual 
variability in children with PAH.  
2.  To  quantify  the  influence  of  subject-specific  factors  (i.e.,  covariates  such  as  age,  body  weight, 
dosing regimen [exposure]) on PK parameters.  
3.  To perform simulations based on PopPK results to investigate the relevance of identified covariates.  
The  data  were  analyzed  in  accordance  with  the  FDA  Guidance  for  Industry  on  Population 
Pharmacokinetics and the EMA/CHMP guideline on PopPK analyses.  
Nonlinear  mixed-effects  modeling  and  simulations  were  performed  using  the  computer  programs 
Monolix (Stand-alone Version 4.2) and R (Version 2.14.1).  
PK assessments were performed at Week 4. Blood samples for PK were drawn at the following times:  
•  Bosentan b.i.d. dosing regimen: immediately before administration of the study medication dose in 
the morning (pre-dose) and at 0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 7.5 h, and 12 h post-dose  
•  Bosentan t.i.d. dosing regimen: immediately before administration of the study medication dose in 
the morning (pre-dose) and at 0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, and 8 h post-dose  
Concentrations of bosentan and its metabolites (i.e., Ro 47-8634, Ro 48-5033, Ro 64-1056) in plasma 
were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The lower limit of quantification in plasma was set 
at 1 ng/mL for bosentan and at 2 ng/mL for its metabolites.  
The following parameters were tested as candidate covariates for model inclusion:  
•  Age (years)  
•  Body weight (kg)  
•  Dosing regimen (b.i.d., t.i.d.)  
Plasma concentration data from 63 subjects were available. Five subjects were excluded from the PK set 
due to protocol violations. In addition, 6 subjects were excluded since their profiles were implausible and 
not  compatible  with  a  model,  i.e.,  their  concentrations  were  increasing  or  decreasing  over  the  entire 
dosing interval or had high trough values with lower values in between. Out of these 6 subjects, 5 were 
on t.i.d. treatment. Finally, 52 subjects were included in the analysis (30 subjects with b.i.d. dosing, 22 
subjects with t.i.d. dosing). Out of the 52 subjects, 14 subjects were below 2 years of age.  
Estimation method and settings 
The  parameters  of  the  population  PK  analysis  were  estimated  using  the  stochastic  approximation 
expectation maximization (SAEM) algorithm in Monolix. The option “auto” was selected for the number of 
iterations in the two stages of the population parameter estimation algorithm: the algorithm determined 
automatically  if  it  could  move  from  one  stage  to  the  next  and  when  to  terminate  the  iteration.  The 
simulated annealing version of SAEM was used to estimate the population parameters. The Monte-Carlo 
sizes,  i.e.,  the  number  of  simulated  samples  to  compute  prediction  distributions,  the  normalized 
prediction distribution errors (NPDE), and the visual predictive checks (VPC), were 100, 500, and 20,000, 
respectively.   
Model building 
The model building process was performed as a two-step approach (development of the base model and 
covariate selection) to determine the inclusion of candidate covariates.  
Model selection 
The simplest structural model was selected based on knowledge of the PK of bosentan from previous 
clinical  studies.  In  addition,  the  most  appropriate  between-subject  variability  model  and  the  residual 
error model were identified and the resulting model was used as a base model.  
The base model consisted of the PK parameters, inter-individual variability (random effects) and residual 
variability in drug concentrations (random variability). Covariates were not included in the base model.  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 23/104 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Covariate selection 
The inclusion of the covariates was tested according to the following relationship, e.g.,  
- for continuous covariates such as age:  TV=THETA(1)×EXP(THETA(2)×AGE)  
- for binary categorical variables such as dosing regimen (ARM):  
TV=THETA(1)×EXP(THETA(2)×ARM) with ARM = 0 for b.i.d and ARM = 1 for t.i.d.  
The model was run with one covariate added on one parameter at a time. The selection of the best model 
was based on the log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) that follows a Chi-square (χ2) distribution. If the decrease 
in objective function value (OFV) was significant (decrease in OFV > 3.84 for 1 degree of freedom with 
1-p = 0.05), the covariate was included in the model.  
Full model and final model 
Following the univariate covariate selection, all statistically significant covariates were added to obtain 
the full model.  
The full model was subsequently used for backward elimination. The covariate leading to the smallest 
increase in OFV if omitted from the model was determined. If the difference in the OFV with and without 
the covariate was less than 7.88 (based on the log-likelihood ratio test for one degree of freedom for 1-p 
= 0.005), this covariate was removed from the model. The reduced model became the new reference 
model. This procedure was repeated until no further covariate had to be removed from the model. The 
resulting model was declared the final model.  
Model qualification 
The  graphical  analyses  consisted  of  goodness-of-fit  plots  (observed  versus  predicted  concentrations, 
weighted  residuals  versus  predicted  concentrations  and  time),  individual  predicted  and  observed 
concentration-time  profiles,  post-hoc  parameter  distributions  and  graphical  evaluation  of  covariate 
effects using post-hoc estimated parameters.  
A  VPC  was  employed  to  verify  that  the  model  predicted  both  the  population-typical  profile  and  the 
variability  in  the  observed  data.  In  this  approach,  the  final  model parameter estimates  were  used to 
simulate the setup of the dataset observed (doses, covariates, and variability). The median, 5th and 95th 
percentiles  of  the  observed  concentration  data  over  time  were  superimposed  graphically  on  the 
corresponding quantiles and 90% confidence intervals of the simulated concentration values over time. 
If the data could arise from the model, they should generally fall into the confidence interval range of the 
simulated data (visual judgment).  
Simulations 
Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 250) were performed based on the final model, to investigate the relevance 
of  the 
identified  covariates  on  bosentan  plasma  concentrations.  The  resulting  simulated 
concentration-time curves were summarized and plotted, and split by the covariates.

Base model development 
Based  on  prior  knowledge  and  data  available,  the  best  structural  model  for  bosentan  was  a 
one-compartment model (with V/f as apparent volume of distribution) with first order absorption (with 
absorption rate constant ka), lag-time (tlag), and first order elimination (with CL/f as apparent total body 
clearance). Bosentan and its metabolites were fit simultaneously. The metabolism from bosentan to Ro 
48-5033 was modeled with a transfer (or conversion) rate constant kt and the elimination of Ro 48-5033 
with an elimination rate constant km. The metabolism from bosentan to Ro 47-8634 was modeled with a 
transfer rate constant kt2 and the elimination of Ro 47-8634 with an elimination rate constant km2. The 
metabolism  from  Ro  48-5033  to  Ro  64-1056  was  modeled  with  a  transfer  rate  constant  kt3  and  the 
elimination of Ro 48-5033 with an elimination rate constant km3. The metabolism from Ro 47-8634 to Ro 
64-1056 (with transfer rate constant kt4) was not modeled initially, but final results are provided with and 
without kt4. The structural model is illustrated in figure 5.

It was assumed that the individual parameters followed a log-normal distribution for the between-subject 
variability. Proportional, combined (additive + proportional), and exponential error models were tested 
and the best error model was an exponential error model for bosentan and a proportional error model for 
the 3 metabolites.  
Covariate selection 
The covariate testing was performed on the base model. The covariates dosing regimen, age, and body 
weight were tested as covariates on all model parameters. The statistically significant covariates based on 
the LRT (their inclusion led to a significant decrease in OFV of 3.84 or more for one degree of freedom and 
1-p = 0.05) were dosing regimen on tlag, ka, CL/f, kt, kt3, km, and km3, age on CL/f and kt, and body 
weight on tlag, CL/f, and km3.  
Full model, backward elimination, and final model 
The full model was built by including all statistically significant covariates. Thus, the full model included 
all 12 covariate effects identified in the previous step.  
During the backward elimination process, 8 covariate effects out of the 12 initially present in the model 
were removed. The resulting model (BACKREF8) was declared to be the final model. The final model 
contained 4 covariate effects: dosing regimen on ka, CL/f, and kt, and body weight on CL/f. Parameter 
estimates for the final model are given in Table 3.

Model qualification 
Goodness-of-fit plots are employed in the following to qualify the model. In order to verify that 
the model predicted both the central tendency and the variability in the observed data, VPCs 
were employed. The VPCs show that the model was able to reproduce both the typical profile 
and the variability in the  observed data.  This analysis shows that the  random  effects were 
approximately  normally  distributed  and  that  the  population  distribution  of  the  individual 
parameters were log-normally distributed (as assumed in the model specification).  
Simulation 
In  this  section,  the  simulations  split  by  covariates  were  investigated  for  their  relevance 
regarding bosentan plasma concentrations. The simulations are the result of the Monte-Carlo 
simulation  (n  =  250  complete  datasets)  based  on  the  final  model.  Simulation  results 
performed for the metabolites are shown in Appendix 11.10. The dose regimen was identified 
as  statistically  significant  covariate  on  ka,  CL/f,  and  kt.  The  differences  in  bosentan 
concentrations  between  the  2  dosing  regimens  were  very  small  with  similar  maximum 
concentrations and slightly faster elimination (higher CL/f) for the t.i.d. dosing regimen. These 
simulations  show  that  the  concentration-time  profiles  differ  between  the  different  body 
weights. Children with higher body weights receive higher total doses (2 mg/kg). On the other 
hand, children with higher body weight have higher clearances: the parameter for the body 
weight effect on clearance was estimated as 0.0419 such that the estimated clearance for a 
body weight of 4 kg is exp (0.0419*4)*1.78 = 2.1 while the estimated clearance for a body 
weight of 32 kg is exp(0.0419*32)*1.78 = 6.8, or more than 3 times as high. Since the dose 
increases from 8 mg to 64 mg (8-fold), the resulting exposure is higher in children with higher 
body weight. Body weight and age are highly correlated and both covariates alone showed 
significant  influence  on  the  PK  of  bosentan  during  individual  covariate  testing.  During 
backward deletion, age was dropped and body weight resulted as the covariate which can better 
explain  differences  in  PK  in  children.  This  effect  of  body  weight  on  bosentan  exposure  was  already 
observed  previously  (FUTURE  1,  BREATHE  3,  and  the  physiologically-based  PK  model  for  bosentan) 
[D-07.041, B-02.003, D-11.250].

Discussion 
The Methodology for model building and validation was well described. 
The  population  PK  characteristics  of  bosentan  and  its  metabolites  in  children  with  PAH  could  be 
adequately described by a population PK model. Bosentan was modeled as a one-compartment model 
with  first  order  absorption  (including  lag-time)  and  first  order  elimination.  Simultaneously,  its  3 
metabolites were modeled with different transfer (conversion) and elimination rates.  The relationship 
between  the  subject-specific  factors  dosing  regimen,  age,  and  body  weight  and  the  different  PK 
parameters were investigated and the following statistically significant covariates were identified: dosing 
regimen on ka, CL/f, and kt, and body weight on CL/f. The model qualification of the final model including 
all significant covariates showed that the model can adequately fit the observed data. The different VPCs 
verified that the model predicted both the population-typical PK and the variability in the observed data. 
Subsequent simulations showed that the overall variability of bosentan concentrations in children is high. 
The influence of body weight on bosentan exposure is in accordance with previous studies (FUTURE 1, 
BREATHE 3) and with physiologically-based PK modeling results for bosentan.   
Regarding the results of the base model and final model, some parameters (e.g. km) were estimated with 
a huge imprecision (high value of RSE close to 100% or much more). If these parameters should be in the 
model, usually a fixed value is assigned to these parameters. The Applicant should explain the reason of 
keeping these parameters to be estimated in the selected model. Maybe a simple model with bosentan 
data only should be built and results from both models should be compared. 
The final model contained 4 covariate effects: dosing regimen on ka, CL/f, and kt, and body weight on 
CL/f.  Simulations  split  by covariates  were investigated  for  their  relevance  regarding  bosentan  plasma 
concentrations.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  differences  in  bosentan  concentrations  between  the  2 
dosing regimens were very small with similar maximum concentrations and  slightly faster elimination 
(higher CL/f) for the t.i.d. dosing regimen. The Applicant did not provide adequate justification for the 
estimation of the values of bosentan PK parameters from the popPK model (i.e. summary of the effect of 
the dosing regimen (t.i.d. vs b.i.d) and the summary of the effect of the dosing regimen (t.i.d. vs b.i.d.) 
on bosentan PK parameters per age group). As the claimed indication was withdrawn by the MAH, this 
issue was not pursued further. 
2.5.2.2.  Study AC052-391- Future 4 
Methods/ study design  
study AC-052-391: multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective study to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of bosentan as add-on therapy to inhaled nitric oxide in 
the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.  
Investigators/ centers and countries: Patients were randomised in 9 centers across 6 countries 
(Czech Republic, France, South Korea, Poland, UK and USA). 
Period of trial: 08 December 2011 to 05 December 2013 
Study design/ Objective 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of bosentan in neonates with PPHN who were in need of 
continued iNO after at least 4 h of continuous iNO treatment. The secondary objectives were to evaluate 
the PK, tolerability, and safety of bosentan in this patient population. 
Term or near-term (gestational age > 34 weeks) hypoxic newborns with refractory respiratory distress 
due to parenchymal lung disease  who requiredhigher than 10 ppm iNO and with fraction of inspired 
oxygen (FiO2) ≥  50% under mechanical ventilation despites at least 4 hour of iNO were included. (see 
complete description below)

Number of patients included 
It was planned to enroll 30 evaluable patients into the study and randomize them in a 2:1 ratio to either 
receive bosentan 2mg/kg b.i.d. or matching placebo. 
Of the 23 randomized patients (15 bosentan, 8 placebo), 21 patients (13 bosentan, 8 placebo) were 
evaluable. Recruitment was terminated early because of unforeseen rarity of the study population. 
Trial drug dose / Route / Regimen / Duration Bosentan 32 mg dispersible tablets dispersed in water prior 
to oral administration of 2 mg/kg birth weight (b.i.d) by nasogastric or orogastric tube administered until 
24 h after complete weaning from iNO or until treatment failure or a maximum of 14 days. 
PK data were analyzed descriptively using the All-treated set (patients who received bosentan) and the PK 
analysis set, i.e., all treated patients for whom at least 5 of the 7 requested blood samples (including the 
pre-dose, the 2 h and 12 h post-dose samples) were available on Day 1 and/or Day 5 (i.e., had at least 
one evaluable profile) and who did not violate the protocol in a way that might have affected the 
evaluation of the PK endpoints. AUC0-24 and Cmax were corrected to a dose of 2 mg/kg (AUC0-24C and 
CmaxC). All AUC and Cmax values were assumed to be log-normally distributed. 
Patient Disposition 
A total of 23 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (N = 15) or placebo (N 
= 8). A total of 21 patients received study drug. Two patients randomized to the bosentan group did not 
receive study treatment due to low birth weight (1 patient) and due to a transient increase in ALT (1 
patient). A total of 20 patients (12 bosentan, 8 placebo) completed study treatment (i.e., 2 doses after 
successful weaning). One patient in the bosentan group discontinued study treatment prematurely due to 
treatment failure (need for ECMO [protocol-defined]). A total of 21 patients (13 bosentan, 8 placebo) 
completed the study The gestational age (median, min–max) was similar for patients in the bosentan 
(40.0 weeks, 36.0–41.0 weeks) and placebo groups (38.5 weeks, 36.0−42.0 weeks). The median age 
(days, min–max) at first dosing with the study treatment was similar in the bosentan (1.4 days, 0.6–5.6 
days) and placebo groups (1.7 days, 0.6–5.9 days). The majority of patients were female (69.2% 
bosentan, 75.0% placebo). 
2.5.2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics results 
As the PK parameters estimated using the popPK analysis were estimated with a very high imprecision, 
the results of the NCA were considered more reliable. On Day 1, the geometric mean AUC0-24C for 
bosentan was 287.5 ng.h/mL (95% CI: 15.0, 5504.7). The bosentan PK profile, on Day 1, was 
characterised by a slow absorption rate which can be explained by slower gastric emptying in neonates. 
On Day 5 (at steady-state), geometric mean AUC0-24C had increased to 11530.2 ng.h/mL (95% CI: 
4507.0, 29497.5), which was approximately 40 times higher than on Day 1. The geometric mean CmaxC 
for bosentan on Day 1 was 30.1 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.4, 372.2) and at steady-state was approximately 
30 times higher (880 ng/mL [95% CI 339.2, 2282.7]). Comparing Day 5 to Day 1, AUC0-24 and Cmax for 
bosentan were respectively 40 times and 30 times lower at Day 1. Therefore the pharmacokinetic profiles 
of bosentan in newborns were substantially different between Day 1 and Day 5. But the substantial

difference in exposure observed between Day 1 and Day 5 could have been driven by very low exposures 
to bosentan after the first dosing rather than by high exposure on Day 5.   
2.5.2.2.2.  Methodology- Pop PK 
This  part  describes  the  results  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  (popPK)  analysis  of  bosentan  in 
pediatric  patients  with  persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of  the  newborn  (PPHN)  from  study 
AC-052-391, pediatric FormUlation of bosenTan in pUlmonary arterial hypeRtEnsion (FUTURE 4).   
Objectives. 
The objectives of the popPK analysis were:  
1.  To describe popPK characteristics (i.e., population-typical pharmacokinetic parameters) of bosentan, 
including inter- and intra-individual variability in neonates with PPHN.  
2.  To quantify the influence of subject-specific factors (i.e., covariates such as age and body weight, 
dose [exposure]) on PK parameters.  
The study AC-052-391 (FUTURE 4) was a Phase 3, exploratory, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, prospective study of bosentan as adjunctive therapy to inhaled nitric 
oxide in the management of PPHN.  
General considerations 
The  data  were  analyzed  in  accordance  with  the  FDA  Guidance  for  Industry  on  Population 
Pharmacokinetics and the EMA/CHMP guideline on PopPK analyses [FDA 1999, EMA 2007].  
PK assessments were performed at Day 1 and at Day 5 (if study drug was discontinued prior to Day 5, PK 
was not assessed on Day 5). Whole blood samples for PK for the preparation of dried blood spot samples 
were drawn at the following timepoints:  
•  On  Day  1:  the  pre-dose  blood  sample  was  to  be drawn  immediately  prior to the  first  study  drug 
administration, and then at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 7.5 h, 12 h after the first study drug administration. 
The 12 h sample was to be drawn before the second study drug administration.  
•  On Day 5 (if applicable): the pre-dose blood sample was to be drawn immediately prior to study drug 
administration. Post-dose samples were to be drawn 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 7.5 h, and 12 h after study 
drug administration. The 12 h sample was to be drawn before the next study drug administration. 
Time of drug administration and time of blood samplings were to be in line with those of Day 1.  
All  assessments  had  to  be  scheduled  in  such  a  way  that  the  actual  timepoint of  PK  sampling  did  not 
deviate by more than ± 5% from the scheduled timepoint of PK sampling. Concentrations of bosentan in 
blood were determined using a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS method). The lower limit of quantification for bosentan in plasma was set at 2 ng/mL.  
Covariates 
The following parameters were tested as candidate covariates for model inclusion:  
•  Age (days) at start of treatment.  
•  Body weight (kg) at start of treatment.  
The covariate “exposure”, i.e., the actual dose based on body weight, was finally not considered as a 
separate covariate, since body weight and dose based on body weight are highly correlated by definition 
and the limited amount of data would not allow to differentiate these two covariates.  
Data programming. 
Blood concentration data from 21 subjects were available (all-treated set). Eight out of the 21 subjects 
were placebo patients with blood concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ).  
The  remaining  13  subjects  with  measurable  blood  concentrations  were  used  for  further  analysis  (6 
subjects with concentration data on Day 1 only, 1 subject with concentration data on Day 5 only [at Day 
1 all samples were BLQ], and 6 subjects with concentration data on Day 1 and Day 5 = 12 subjects with 
data on Day 1 and Day 7 subjects with data on Day 5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015

 Bosentan profiles were atypical on Day 1. For most of the patients the concentrations were continuously 
increasing over the first dosing interval. On Day 5, the 7 patients who were still under bosentan treatment 
showed more common profiles.  
The analysis was therefore split in Day 1 and Day 5: at Day 1, for one subject all blood concentrations 
were BLQ and only the remaining 12 subjects were used for further analysis; at Day 5, data from only 7 
subjects were available, since in some cases drug treatment was discontinued prior to Day 5 and PK was 
then  not  assessed  at  Day  5.  Furthermore,  5  individual  data  points  were  excluded  because  plasma 
concentrations were extremely high (implausible) or second peaks were observed being not compatible 
with standard PK models (excluded data points are shown in Table 1).  
The  split  between  Day  1  and  Day  5  was  motivated  by  the  fact  that  the  observed  plasma 
concentration-time  profiles  differed  substantially.  This  suggested  that  the  PK  parameters  change 
dramatically during the first days of life and therefore it was reasonable to assess the PK parameters 
separately for Day 1 and Day 5.

The base model consisted of the PK parameters, inter-individual variability (random effects) 
and  residual  variability  in  drug  concentrations  (random  variability).  Covariates  were  not 
included in the base model. 
Covariate selection 
 The inclusion of the covariates was tested according to the following relationship, e.g., for 
continuous covariates such as age:  
with   TV = typical   value,  THETA(1)  =  population  parameter  value,  and  THETA(2)  = 
covariate effect. The model was run with one covariate added on one parameter at a time. The 
selection  of  the  best  model  was  based  on  the  log-likelihood  ratio  test  (LRT)  that  follows  a 
Chi-square (χ2) distribution. If the decrease in objective function value (OFV) was significant 
(decrease in OFV > 3.84 for 1 degree of freedom with p = 0.05), the covariate was included 
into the model.  
Full model and final model 
Following the univariate covariate selection, all statistically significant covariates were added 
to obtain the full and final model.  
Model qualification 
The  graphical  analyses  consisted  of  goodness-of-fit  plots  (observed  versus  predicted 
concentrations,  weighted  residuals  versus  predicted  concentrations  and  time),  individual 
predicted  and  observed  concentration-time  profiles,  post-hoc  parameter  distributions  and 
graphical evaluation of covariate effects using post-hoc estimated parameters.

Results 
Base model development 
Based  on  prior  knowledge  and  data  available,  the  selected  structural  model  for  bosentan  was  a 
one-compartment model (with V/f as apparent volume of distribution) with first order absorption (with 
absorption rate constant ka), and first order elimination (with CL/f as apparent total body clearance). The 
structural model is illustrated in Figure 4.  
Figure 4  
Structural population PK model  
 It  was  assumed  that  the individual  parameters  (random  effects)  characterizing 
the between-subject variability followed a log-normal distribution. Since the exploratory data analysis 
showed a significant difference between Day 1 and Day 5, model parameters were estimated for both 
days individually. Table 2 shows the estimated population parameters for the base model on Day 1 and 
Table 3 on Day 5.

As visualized in Figure 5, the two base popPK models at Day 1 and Day 5 differ substantially. Given the 
Day 5 data, the model based on the Day 1 data seems implausible.

Covariate selection 
The covariate testing was performed on the base model. The results of the covariate testing are given in 
Table  4  (Day  1)  and  Table  5  (Day  5).  The  covariates  age  and  body  weight  (at  birth)  were  tested  as 
covariates on all model parameters. For Day 1, none of the covariates was significant. For Day 5, the 
statistically significant covariates based on the LRT (their inclusion led to a significant decrease in OFV of 
3.84 or more for one degree of freedom and p = 0.05) were body weight on V/f and CL/f.

Final model 
The  final  model  for  Day  1  is  equivalent  to  the  base  model  [see  Table  2],  since  no  covariate  had  a 
statistically significant influence on the PK parameters. For Day 5, body weight was a significant covariate 
on V/f and CL/f. Due to the limited amount of data, no backward deletion was performed and both terms 
were therefore added to the base model to obtain the final model [Table 6].

The effect of body weight on V/f and CL/f might be explained by the dramatic physiologic changes during 
the first days of life in neonates and the differences in gestational age between neonates with different 
body weights. Figure 6 visualizes the effect of body weight on the PK in neonates based on the final popPK 
model. Predictions of the effect of body weight should be interpreted with caution due to the limited size 
and high variability of the data.

Model qualification. 
Goodness-of-fit plots are employed in the following to qualify the model.   
2.5.2.2.3.  Discussion  
The methodology for model building and validation was well described.  
Bosentan  was  modeled  as  a  one-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  and  first-order 
elimination. Since the exploratory data analysis showed a significant difference between Day 1 and Day 
5, model parameters were estimated for both days individually.  
The  relationship  between  the  subject-specific  factors  age  and  body  weight  and  the  different  PK 
parameters were investigated and the covariate effects body weight on V/f and CL/f were identified to be 
statistically significant (on Day 5 only). Higher body weight resulted in higher V/f and a higher CL/f, but 
these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited amount of data and high variability 
observed.  
The  qualification  of  the  final  models  showed  that  the  models  can  adequately  fit  the  observed  data. 
Predictions of unobserved data and simulations should be interpreted with caution though due to the 
limited amount of data and high variability observed.  
According  to  the  MAH,  the  differences  between  Day  1  and  Day  5  can  be  explained  by  substantial 
physiologic changes during the first days of life in neonates, e.g., changes in absorption (i.e., gastric pH, 
gastric  emptying),  and  clearance  pathways.  The  model  parameter  estimates  on  Day  5  are  closer  to 
population parameter estimates for bosentan in older children (above 3 months of age) [D-14.035] than 
to the model parameter estimates on Day 1, including the observed influence of body weight on the PK 
of bosentan.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics 
The popPK characteristics of bosentan in neonates with PPHN could be described by popPK models with 
the caveat that only limited data with high variability were available. The PK parameters were estimated 
with a very high imprecision (base and final model). Therefore, it is difficult to consider these estimations 
reliable. A noncompartmental analysis seems to be needed to compare PK parameters on Day 1 and Day 
5. 
Furthermore,  the  estimated  values  of  the  primary  PK  parameters  (CL,  V  and  Ka)  are  very  different 
between FUTURE 3 and FUTURE 4 studies. 
As the pharmacokinetic profiles of bosentan in newborns were substantially different between Day 1 and 
Day  5,  model  parameters  were  estimated  for  both  days  separately.  According  to  the  Applicant,  this 
suggested that the PK parameters change dramatically during the first days of life. However bearing in 
mind that bosentan PK is subject to autoinduction, it is not clear if that deep change in PK is linked to the 
maturity of the enzymatic system or to autoinduction phenomenon. 
This observation of dramatic change in PK highlights the need of further investigation of bosentan PK in 
the claimed subgroup of children (3 months to 2 years).

Pharmacokinetics of bosentan on this subgroup cannot be considered as well characterized due to the 
limited  data.  Looking  at  demographic  data  of  patients  included  in  FUTURE  3,  of  the  64  randomized 
patients, 21 were < 2 years (33%) with only 4 patients < 1 year with PK data and 43 were ≥ 2 years. The 
PK analysis was performed on 58 subjects including only 4 patients < 1 year. In summary, data collected 
on the subgroup of interest (i.e. children aged from 3 months to 2 years) were too limited to adequately 
characterize the PK profile of bosentan in children from 3 months to 1 year. However for children above 
1year, further recommendations can be made and the section 4.2 is updated accordingly. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data collected on the subgroup of interest (children aged from 3 months to 2 years) were too limited 
to adequately characterize the PK profile of bosentan in children from 3 months to 1 year.  
Nevertheless updated information is inserted in the SmPC section 5.2. For children above 1year, updated 
information is inserted in the posology section.  
2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.1.  Main study(ies) 
Efficacy  data  provided  in  support  of  this  application  are  based  on  exploratory  endpoints  from  the 
open-label, not controlled studies conducted with the 32mg dispersible tablet formulation of bosentan in 
pediatric patients with PAH: FUTURE 1 (AC-052-365) and its extension (FUTURE 2 ; AC-052-367), and 
the recently completed FUTURE 3 (AC-052-373).  
The final study report of FUTURE 1 (D-07.041) and preliminary analysis from its extension FUTURE 2 with 
data  cut-off  of  1  March  2008  were  previously  submitted  and  assessed  through  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/401/X/0039 that ended on April 2009. The present application provided cumulative final data 
up to end of FUTURE 2 study (last patient visit 28 October 2011). 
No efficacy data are presented for the ongoing FUTURE 3 extension study. 
In addition, data are presented for a placebo controlled study newly conducted with 32 mg dispersible 
tablets  in  patients  with  persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of  the  newborn  (PPHN;  FUTURE  4 ; 
AC-052-391). 
No patients were enrolled in FUTURE 4 extension at the time of completion of FUTURE 4 study, hence no 
data is available.

2.6.1.1.  FUTURE 1 study (AC-052-365) 
This  study  was  an  open-label,  multicenter,  uncontrolled,  12-week  (3  months)  study  to  assess  the 
pharmacokinetics (as primary objective) and tolerability and safety (as secondary objective) of bosentan 
orally administered with 32 mg dispersible tablets in children with idiopathic or familial pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. 
The study consisted of a screening period of a maximum of 4 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and 
a post-treatment follow-up period of 28 days (see Figure 1). Patients were to receive the bosentan with 
a 32 mg dispersible tablet formulation orally for 12 weeks, with the dosage adjusted to the patient’s body 
weight at study start. After 4 weeks of treatment, the initial dose of 2 mg/kg b.i.d. was to be up-titrated 
to the maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. All patients were to start the study drug at the 2 mg/kg b.i.d. 
dose, whether or not they were previously treated with bosentan.  
Patients  weighing  30  kg  or  more  were  to  receive  a  maximum  of  120  mg  b.i.d.  of  bosentan,  unless 
down-titration was necessary, in which case they were to receive 64 mg b.i.d. 
Demographics at baseline and disposition: 
In this study 36 children aged from 2 to 11 years (mean age = 6.7 ± 2.7 years; mean weight: 22.4 ± 8.1 
kg)  were included. One patient was excluded due to the development of confounding condition.  
The  greatest  proportion  of  patients  were  6  to  11  years  old  (63.9%  =  23  patients)  and  the  lowest 
proportion of patients was between 2-3 years (11.1 % = 4 patients) and 9 patients were 4 to 5 years old.  
Thirty one patients (86.1%) were diagnosed as idiopathic PAH and 5 (13.9%) as familial PAH. 
A total of 15 patients/36 (41.7%) had “previous bosentan” intake prior to study treatment start (9 in WHO 
class II, 5 in WHO class III) and 21 patients/36 (58.3%) were identified as “bosentan naïve” patients (14 
in WHO class II, 7 in WHO class III).  
The most common treatments reported at baseline by frequency were epoprostenol (9 patients, 25.0%), 
furosemide (8 patients, 22.2%), and oxygen (7 patients, 19.4%). 
Efficacy results : 
Efficacy  was  assessed  only  exploratory  based  on  WHO  functional  status  measurement,  patients’  and 
physicians’ clinical impression rate, and SF10 questionnaire.  
The changes from baseline to week 4, 8, and 12 in the WHO functional class showed the majority of 
patients were stable. At Week 12, out of the 23 patients at baseline who were diagnosed class II, one 
worsened to class III and two improved to class I (the remaining 20 patients were stable at class II), and 
out of the 12 patients at baseline who were diagnosed class III, none worsened, and three improved to 
class II. The improvements were mainly observed in bosentan naïve patients while in contrast patients 
previously treated with bosentan remained largely stable with one patient worsening from class II to class 
III.

Out of the 24 patients whose condition the physician rated as ‘good’ or ‘very good’ at baseline, two were 
considered to be doing ‘worse’ or ‘significantly worse’, with the majority of responses being ‘no change’ or 
‘better’, at Week 12.  
Parents and physician global clinical impression 
Out of the 17 patients whose condition the parents rated ‘not good or bad’ or ‘bad’ at baseline, 9 patients 
were considered to be doing ‘better’ or ‘significantly better’ at Week 12.  
Out of the 17 patients whose condition the parents rated ‘good’ or ‘very good’ at baseline, only 1 patient 
was considered to be doing ‘worse’ or ‘significantly worse’ at Week 12, with 9 patients considered being 
either ‘significantly better’ or ‘better’ at Week 12. 
For the majority of cases, parents’ responses were consistent with, or more positive than, the physician’s 
assessment at each timepoint. Out of 11 patients whose condition the physician rated ‘not good or bad’ or 
‘bad’ at baseline, 6 patients were considered to be doing ‘better’ or ‘significantly better’ by Week 12. Out 
of 24 patients whose condition the physician rated ‘good’ or ‘very good’ at baseline, only 2 patients were 
considered to be doing ‘worse’ or ‘significantly worse’, with the majority of responses being ‘no change’ or 
‘better’, at Week 12. 
Neither any exercise capacity tests nor pulmonary hemodynamic measurements were performed in this 
study.  
Clinical worsening occurred in 2 patients leading to discontinuation and one of them died during the study 
(suspected infection otitis triggering right ventricular failure).   
CHMP discussion 
This  study  was  previously  assessed    in  the  procedure  EMA/HC/401/X/039.  PK  results  from  this  study 
showed  that  the  systemic  exposures  with  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  and  with  4  mg/kg  b.i.d.  were  similar  and 
approximately  half  lower  than  in  adults  (historical  controls)  when  treated  with  125  mg  b.i.d. 
(corresponding to the dose of  2 mg/kg b.i.d. in adults weighing around 60 kg). 
Efficacy was only exploratory. The majority of patients remained stable after 12 weeks treatment with the 
maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. based on WHO functional class assessment. 9/36 patients (25.0%), 
were  receiving  concomitant  epoprostenol.  No  hemodynamic  measurement  were  performed.  Clinical 
worsening during the 12-week period leading to discontinuation occurred in 2 patients and one of them 
died. No pulmonary hemodynamic measurements were performed nor any exercise capacity tests.

2.6.1.2.  Study AC-052-367 (FUTURE-2): cumulative analysis from FUTURE-1 and 
FUTURE-2 
FUTURE-2 is the extension of FUTURE-1. 
It was open-labelled, not-controlled with the primary objective to collect additional and longer than 12 
weeks safety data and additional exploratory efficacy and outcome data (i.e.: PAH worsening, time to 
initiation  of  new  therapy  for  PAH,  time  to  new  onset  or  worsening  of  right  heart  failure,  vital  status,

functional capacity, QoL, and physicians’ and parents’ GCI) in paediatric patients with IPAH or familial PAH 
using 32 mg dispersible tablets. 
Of the 36 patients enrolled in FUTURE-1, 33 patients entered in FUTURE-2.  
An interim cumulative efficacy analysis was presented through procedure EMEA/H/C/401/X/0039 in May 
2008 based upon data collected from May 2005 (FUTURE-1 beginning) to 1er March 2008.  
The present submission provides the cumulative analysis for all patients in FUTURE 1 and its extension 
(FUTURE 2) from the start of bosentan study treatment up to end of study of FUTURE 2 (first patients first 
visit on 23 August 2005 to last patient, last visit: 28 October 2011). The final study report (D-12.790) is 
dated on 17 December 2012.  
Patients continuing into FUTURE-2 were to continue receiving the 4 mg/kg b.i.d. maintenance dose they 
were receiving at the end of FUTURE-1 unless this dose was not tolerated. In such cases, patients were 
down  titrated  to  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  The  dosage  was  adjusted  to  the  patient’s  body  weight  at  each  visit 
throughout the study. Doses were dispensed by step of 8 mg delivered using ¼ of the 32 mg dispersible 
tablets. 
Patients weighing 30 kg or over were to receive a maximum dose of 120 mg b.i.d., and a maximum of 64 
mg b.i.d. if down-titration was necessary. 
Baseline demographics and disposition of patients :  
Two  of  the  36  patients  included  prematurely  discontinued  the  study  FUTURE-1.  Of  the  remaining  34 
patients, 33 agreed to continue bosentan treatment in FUTURE 2 (one refusal). 
Treatment was to be discontinued in patients who reached the age of 12 years during the study, as the 
upper limit of the included age range was < 12 years of age. Six patients reached the age of 12 during the 
FUTURE  2  study  and  remained  in  the  study  for  a  further  23  to  489  days  (around  17,5  months)  after 
reaching this age. 
Summary of the demographic characteristics of all treated patients at baseline of FUTURE-1 study has 
been detailed in the above description of FUTURE-1. 
Overall, a total of 19 patients (52.8%) (6 (40.0%) of them in the subgroup with previous bosentan and 13 
(61.9%) in the bosentan-naïve subgroup) discontinued prematurely from the core or extension study due 
to  administrative  reasons  or  withdrawal  of  consent  (n  = 10),  disease  progression,  AEs,  transplant  or 
treatment failure (n = 5), or death caused by PAH or infection (n = 4). 
Given  the  evolving  treat-to-target  treatment  approach,  the  MAH  speculates  that  the  administrative 
reasons might have included addition of new PAH-specific therapy without prior worsening of PAH. One 
patient who prematurely discontinued due to administrative/other reasons reached adult weight and was 
switched to the adult formulation of bosentan.  
The MAH considers that this rate of discontinuation can be expected in this population of PAH patient and 
for a study of this duration. However as it is open-label, no comparison can be made.

Duration of exposure  to bosentan  
Duration of exposure to bosentan throughout FUTURE-1 and FUTURE-2 studies ranged from 8.4 weeks to 
258.0 weeks (60 months i.e. 5 years) with overall median duration of exposure of 119.9 weeks (i.e 28 
months = 2,3 years).  
6  patients  received  5  years  treatment,  8  patients  received  between  4  years  to  5  years  treatment,  7 
patients received between 3 to 4 years treatment, 8 patients received between 2 to 3 years treatment. 
At the end of study (EOS), a total of 16 patients completed the FUTURE 2 study 
Concomitant PAH-specific medications : 
Specific  PAH  medication  such  as  calcium  channel  blockers,  intravenous  epoprostenol  intravenous  or 
inhaled iloprost were permitted at inclusion and during the study but not sildenafil. Addition of any PAH 
medication including sildenafil was only permitted in the case of documented worsening PAH worsening. 
If the initiation of an ET receptor antagonist other than bosentan was considered, the study drug was 
discontinued. 
At baseline, 9 patients took epoprostenol (25.0%).  2 patients took sildenafil or other PAH-specific drugs 
in the absence of PAH worsening (protocol violation).  
Among the 36 initially included patients, a total of 9 patients were newly initiated PAH-specific therapy 
during FUTURE 1/2 study and were all rated as clinical worsening event before (7 patients) or at the time 
of the start of the new PAH-medication (2 patients) in the time to clinical worsening analysis.  
Efficacy results : 
Exploratory efficacy end point were analysed on the cumulative data from FUTURE 1 and FUTURE 2. All 
patients  from  FUTURE-1  except  one  refusal  and  2  discontinuation  with  FUTURE-1  were  included  in 
FUTURE-2 and continued their treatment (33/36 patients). The analysis based on cumulative review from 
FUTURE-1 and 2 was considered acceptable. .   
WHO functional class : 
Of the 33 patients entered in FUTURE-2, data for WHO functional class at baseline and end of study or 
premature discontinuation of study drug (FUTURE 1 or 2) were available for 28 patients.  
Among 28 subjects with available data, data (among the 36 patients initially included in FUTURE 1), the 
WHO FC remained unchanged at End-of-Study or premature discontinuation of study drug (FUTURE 1 or 
2) as compared to baseline, in 15 subjects (53.6%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 43/104 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Among the remaining 8 patients initially included in FUTURE1, 3 patients died, 1 worsened, no worsening 
is reported in the 4 other cases.  
Thus, it could be concluded that of the 36 patients included in FUTURE 1, at the time of the last reported 
WHO class assessment, 11 + 1 improved in WHO FC, 2 + 4  worsened or died, and 15 + 3 remained 
unchanged  during  the  bosentan  treatment  administration  (but  it  is  unclear  how  many  patients  were 
finally using bosentan as monotherapy. 
All patients were symptomatic at baseline (class II or III) allowing some room to assess any change. A 
higher rate of patients improved in the naïve bosentan group as compared to the group of patient treated 
with  bosentan  before  the  start  of  the  study  suggesting  that  bosentan  introduction  had  some  effect. 
However, as this study was single arm not controlled no comparison can be made or would be limited.    
WHO  functional  class  has  been  established  for  adults  and  may  not  be  readily  appropriate  for  the 
assessment of functional status or effect of a drug in PAH children. But it is acknowledged that a disease 
classification to assess functional status in children was not available at the time when the study was 
conducted.  
Quality of life: 
SF-10 physical (PHS) and psychosocial (PSS) summary scores (range: 0–100) were available for 15/36 
(42%) and  16/36  patients  (45%),  respectively,  at  baseline  and  EOS  or  premature  discontinuation  of 
study drug (FUTURE 1 or 2). In this sample the mean physical summary score improved by 10.2 (median 
4.7) over the course of the study. The mean psychosocial summary score decreased slightly by – 4.4. 
(median – 4.0). 
The Short Form Health Survey has been designed for children, SF-10 and can be used in children with 
pulmonary hypertension, but it is not disease specific. Nor does it help assess children less than 5 five 
years of age. 
Parents’ and physicians’ assessment of global clinical conditions (CGI): 
In  13  (81.3%)  out  of  16  patients  with  available  data,  GCIS  as  rated  by  the  parents  improved  from 
baseline  to  end  of  study  or  premature  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (FUTURE  1  or  2).  It  remained 
unchanged in 2 patients and worsened in 1 patient (6.3%). 
In  17  (65.4%)  out  of  26  patients  with  available  data,  GCIS  as  rated  by  the  physician  improved  from 
baseline to EOS or premature discontinuation of study drug (FUTURE 1 or 2). It remained unchanged in 
7 patients and worsened in 2 patients (7.7%). 
After 6 months of treatment in the FUTURE 1 and 2 study, approximately 27% of patients remained stable 
according to physicians’ and parents’ / legal representatives’ GCIS ratings. The proportion of patients who 
improved  was  approximately  59%  according  to  both  physicians’  ratings  and  parents’  /  legal 
representatives’ ratings. Approximately 13% of patients were rated as having worsened according to both 
groups of raters. 
Time to worsening of PAH: 
Time to worsening of PAH was assessed based on the 2 following definitions : 
-  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  death,  transplantation,  or  hospitalization  for  PAH  worsening  (from 
baseline in FUTURE 1). 
- time to first occurrence of worsening of PAH (as defined above), or initiation of new therapy for PAH, or 
new  right  heart  failure,  or  worsening  of  right  heart  failure  (from  baseline  in  FUTURE  1)  (broader 
definition).

The  KM  event-free  estimate  for  worsening  of  PAH  was  88.1%  at  6  months,  78.9%  (95%  CI  60.7%, 
89.3%) at 2 years, 73.6% (95% CI 53.1%, 86.2%) at 4 years and 63.1% (95% CI 35.3%, 81.6%) at 5

The MAH provided Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to worsening of PAH (defined as the first occurrence 
of death, transplantation, or hospitalization for PAH worsening), initiation of new therapy for PAH, new 
right  heart  failure  or  worsening  of  right  heart  failure  (from  baseline  in  FUTURE  1)  –  All-treated  set

2.6.1.3.  Study AC-052-373 (FUTURE 3) 
Study title 
Pediatric  FormUlation  of  bosenTan  in  pUlmonary  arterial  hypeRtEnsion  an  open-label,  randomized 
multicenter, multiple dose trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, safety and efficacy of the 
pediatric formulation of bosentan two versus three times a day in children from 3 months to less than 12 
years of age with pulmonary arterial hypertension.” 
The study was conducted by Actelion from 8 March 2011 to 19 August 2013. The study was conducted at 
45 expert pediatric PAH centers across 20 countries in Europe, North America, Latin America, Australia, 
Asia and Africa.  
Study design 
This  study  was  a  prospective,  multicenter,  open-label,  randomized  parallel-group  study  primarily 
designed to investigate the PK of the dispersible tablet formulation of bosentan at doses of 2mg/kg b.i.d. 
and 2 mg/kg t.i.d. in children from ≥ 3 months to < 2 years of age and from 2 years to < 12 years of age 
with  stable  PAH  (idiopathic  or  persistent  for  at  least  6  months  after  complete  surgical  repair  of  a 
congenital  heart  defect,  or  PAH-CHD  associated  with  open  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts,  including 
Eisenmenger syndrome, with PVR > 8 Wood Units and Qp/Qs < 2). 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of bosentan in children 
from ≥ 3 months to < 2 years of age and from 2 years to < 12 years of age with PAH as described above. 
CHMP comments:  
This study was primarily designed as a PK study and further explore the PK profile in children bearing in 
mind the plateau of systemic exposure that was observed with 4 mg.kg b.i.d. in the previous FUTURE-1 
study. However, efficacy and subsequent benefit of increasing the dose higher than 2 mg/kg b.i.d. was 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 50/104 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also a missing information that needed to be addressed. For more accurate evaluation it would have been 
possible to conduct in a double blinded design but this was not the choice of the sponsor.  
The dosage of bosentan was adjusted according to the patient’s body weight at initiation of the study 
treatment (Visit 2) and may have been readjusted after 12 weeks of treatment (Visit 4) if necessary. The 
body weight dose-adjustment was performed by steps of 8 mg, corresponding to a quarter of a 32 mg 
dispersible tablets. 
Patients  who  completed  the  24  week  treatment  period  had  the  option  of  participation  in  a  one-year 
follow-up extension study (FUTURE-3 extension is on-going, no efficacy data are provided in the present 
submission). 
Demographics: 
64 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (N=33) or 2 mg/kg t.i.d. (N=31) 
treatment groups. The overall population was predominantly male (56.3%) and Caucasian (75.0%),  
The median age was 3.8 years (range: 0.3–11.4 years) sligtly higher in the t.i.d. group (median age 4.8 
years) as compared to the b.i.d. (median age 3.7 years).   
Of the 64 randomized patients 43 (67%) were ≥ 2 years of age (23 b.i.d., 20 t.i.d.) and  21 (33%) were 
< 2 years (10 b.i.d., 11 t.i.d.). Among them 6 were less than 1 year (2 b.i.d. and 4 t.i.d.) and 15 (8 b.i.d. 
and 7 t.i.d.) were between 1 to 2 years old.  
The  etiology  of  PAH  was  mainly  idiopathic  PAH  (46.0%),  associated  PAH  (38.1%)  and  PAH-CHD 
associated with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (12.7%).  
CHMP comments 
On average, based on the WHO FC (used for adults), the disease condition at baseline was more severe 
in patients in the b.i.d. group (WHO FC I/II: 63.6%, III: 36.4%) than in the t.i.d. group (WHO FC I/II: 
80.6%, III: 19.4%).  
In comparison to the profile of WHO FC in FUTURE 1 and 2 patients (II 63.9%, III 36.1%), the disease 
condition was less severe in FUTURE 3 patients (I 25.0%, II 46.9%, III 28.1%). The mean (± SD) time 
since diagnosis of PAH in FUTURE 2 (32.2 months) was longer than in the FUTURE 3 study (approximately 
18 months). 
In  summary,  18/64  patients  received  bosentan  at  baseline  before  starting  of  the  study,  46/64  were 
bosentan naïve at baseline.  
At baseline, PDE-5 inhibitors were present in 53 % (34/64) of patients: 51.5% (17/33) in b.i.d. group and 
54.8 % (17/31) in the t.i.d group of whom 10.9% (7/64) also received prostanoids (15.2% (5/33) in the 
b.i.d group and 6.5 % (2/31) in the t.i.d group. In total, 12.5 % (8/64) received prostanoids: 15.2% 
(5/33) patients in the b.i.d. group and 9.7% (3/31) in the t.i.d group. In other words, a total of 54.7% 
(35/64)  of  patients  (b.i.d:  51.5%  (17/33);  t.i.d.:  58  %  (18/31)  received  at  least  one  PAH-specific 
medication other than bosentan.  
As only 4 patients discontinued the treatment prematurely, it is considered that no more than 45.3% 
(b.i.d : 48.5%; t.i.d: 41.9%) were treated with bosentan alone during the study as more than half of the 
patients received bosentan combined with another PAH-specific medication.  
Disposition: 
In total, 4 patients (2 in the 2 mg/kg b.i.d. group and 2 in the t.i.d. group, respectively) discontinued the 
study  treatment  prematurely  either  due  to  AEs  (n = 3  worsening  of  PAH,  which  in  one  case  was 
associated with bronchopneumonia) or withdrawal of consent (n = 1). Of the 4 patients who discontinued 
the study prematurely, 3 were < 2 years of age (1 b.i.d. and 2 t.i.d.).  
The mean exposure duration to bosentan was similar in the b.i.d. group (23.6 ± 3.71 weeks) and t.i.d. 
group (23.3 ± 5.02 weeks).  72.7% in the b.i.d. group and 77.4% in the t.i.d. group had at least 24 weeks 
of exposure.  
The mean (± SD) exposure duration (weeks) to bosentan in patients < 2 years of age (22.8 ± 5.98 weeks 
b.i.d., 21.8 ± 8.29 weeks t.i.d.) and ≥ 2 years of age (24.0 ± 2.22 weeks b.i.d., 24.1 ± 1.35 weeks t.i.d.) 
were similar.

Disposition of patients in the FUTURE 3 study 
In total, 58 patients were enrolled in the FUTURE 3 study extension after 24 weeks of treatment in the 
FUTURE 3 core study.  
FUTURE-3 extension is on-going. No efficacy data are provided in the present submission. 
Exploratory efficacy analysis Results and discussion 
No formal hypothesis testing was defined. Efficacy was assessed only exploratory. 
Patients were considered study completers if they completed the 24-week treatment period, or in case of 
premature discontinuationof study treatment, provided relevant End of Study (EOS)  
Global EOS was defined as the date on which the last randomized patient, for whom study treatment was 
not prematurely discontinued, completed the 24-week treatment and a 7-day adverse event (AE) 
follow-up period. 
WHO functional class (WHO FC): 
At start of treatment, 19 subjects were in class I, 27 subjects in class II and 18 subjects in class 
III.During the study, the majority of patients (82.8%) remained clinically stable, i.e.: without 
change in WHO FC status from baseline to the last post-baseline value up to end of treatment 
(EOT) + 7 days (75.8% in the b.i.d. group versus 90.3% in the t.i.d. group). 
A greater proportion of patients improved from baseline to the last post-baseline value up to EOT + 7 days 
in the b.i.d. group (7 patients, 29.2%) than in the t.i.d. group (3 patients 14.3%).  
In the b.i.d.: 5 patients improved from WHO FC III to II, and 2 improved from WHO FC II to I.  
In the t.i.d. group, 3 patients improved from WHO FC II to I.  
Improvement in WHO class was reported in 7 out of 10 patients newly exposed to bosentan.  
Of the 10 patients who had improvement in WHO FC, 7 patients (4 b.i.d., 3 t.i.d) were bosentan naïve (4 
of whom were naïve to any PAH-specific treatment) and 3 were non-bosentan naïve (all b.i.d.).  
Worsening was reported for 1 patient in the b.i.d. group.

FUTURE-3 : Change (shift) in WHO functional class from baseline to last 
post-baseline value up to EOT + 7 days and proportion 
worsened/unchanged/improved; overall age group, All-randomized set 
Based on WHO classification, the greater proportion of patients remained stable during the study. Only 
one patient worsened while a greater proportion of patients improved in the b.i.d. group as compared to 
the t.i.d.group. Since more than half of the patients received combined PAH-specific medications (PDE-5 
inhibitors and/or prostanoids),  it cannot be excluded that the apparent majority of clinical stability in 
WHO class is related to the high proportion of patients stable at baseline continuing their therapy but this 
render  difficult  the  assessment  of  the  true  effect  of  bosentan.  It  would  be  interesting  to  know  the 
evolution in patients treated with bosentan alone. 
40.6% (26/64) of subjects remained on bosentan monotherapy during the 24 weeks of study treatment 
without experiencing PAH worsening.” 
Functional  status  (so  called  WHO  functional  status)  was  measured  using  the  Dana  Point  pulmonary 
hypertension  specific  classification  (based  on  NYHA  classification)  for  adults.  This  classification  is  not 
readily  appropriate  to  pediatric  disease  especially  because,  physical  growth  and  maturation  achieved 
influences the way in which the functional effects of a disease are expressed.  
The Experts considered that the adult classification would be appropriate for children aged >16 years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 53/104 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The  Functional  Classification  of  Pulmonary  Hypertension  in  Children  proposed  by the  members  of  the 
Pediatric  Task  Force  during  the  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Pulmonary  Vascular  Research  Institute  (PVRI) 
February 2011 follows the same pattern as the adult classification with four classes of disease severity, 
Class IV being the most severe and Class III has been subdivided into a) and b).  
Five different age groups were determined of whom 3 dealt with children less than two years of age when 
the most rapid physical development and maturation occurs (i.e. : 0-0.5; 0.5-1; 1-2; 2-5 and 5-16 years 
of age). 
It  is  acknowledged  that  disease  specific  classification  to  assess  functional  status  in  children  with 
pulmonary  hypertension  was  not  available  before  this  consensus    (i.e.  at  the  time  FUTURE  3  was 
designed). However, the functional assessment based on the classification for children newly defined in 
February 2011 and published in April 2011 could have been introduced via a protocol amendment after 
the study started (first patient enrolled in March 2011). 
A  subgroup  analysis  was  performed  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  bosentan-naïve  at  baseline  (n=  46 
patients  =  71.9%)  and  patients  previously  treated  with  bosentan  before  starting  the  study  (n=18 
patients= 28.1 %).  
The percentage of patients who improved on WHO FC functional class, was quite similar in patients who 
were already treated with bosentan as compared to those bosentan naïve patients (i.e. 23.1% (n= 3/18)  
versus 21.9% (n= 7/46) respectively) with a tendency for less patients improved in the bosentan naïve 
group.  The  same  proportion  of  patients  remained  unchanged  in  each  subgroup  whether  they  were 
bosentan-naïve  or  previously  treated  with  bosentan  (i.e.  82.6%  versus  83.3%  respectively).  One 
bosentan naïve patient worsened. 
CHMP comments:  
It is not surprising that stable patients (as defined in protocol) previously treated with bosentan were 
mainly unchanged after the start of the study, but as newly treated with bosentan, the introduction of 
bosentan in naïve bosentan patients should have resulted in a higher rate of improvement as compared 
to the bosentan treated patients. Conversely, the rate of patients who improved were lower in the newly 
treated  patients  group  as  compared  to  those  previously  treated  with  bosentan.  These  results  would 
suggest no clinically significant effect relating to the introduction of bosentan, except if patients were 
asymptomatic and then did not require to be treated with bosentan.  
The MAH referred to the lower severity of the naïve bosentan sub-group as compared to the bosentan non 
naïve sub-group at baseline (WHO class III: 21.7% versus 44.4%, respectively) allowing less room for 
improvement in the naïve bosentan group. This could be only a partial explanation since it is noticed that 
in the bosentan naïve subgroup there was a higher rate of class II that could have been improved to class 
I (52.2%) than in the bosentan non naïve subgroup (33.3%).  
It is  acknowledged that the heterogeneity of the groups may  have impaired the comparison between 
bosentan naïve patients and non-bosentan naïve patients. However, it remains that the present data did 
not demonstrate that the introduction of bosentan exerted an improvement in WHO FC status in bosentan 
naïve patients.  
As the study is not controlled it cannot be established whether the stabilisation of the WHO FC functional 
status during the short term period of the study can be related to the true effect of bosentan alone.  
Echocardiography/Doppler 
The  echocardiography/Doppler  subgroup    included  a  total  of  56  patients  (27  b.i.d.,  29 t.i.d)  i.e.  all 
patients except those 8 patients with a derived etiology called “PAH-CHD”[open shunt]. 
The changes from baseline to the last post-baseline value up to EOT + 7 days (i.e. : observed data and 
without worst imputation value) in the echocardiography/Doppler variables were small and overlapping in 
both b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups.  
However, in the b.i.d. group, the mean change in inferior vena cava size collapse was greater than in the 
t.i.d. group (13.12% vs –0.71%).  
Pericardial effusion, assessed by categories of severity, remained stable during the study for the majority 
of  patients  of  the  echo/Doppler  subgroup  (45  patients),  worsened  in  5  patients,  and  improved  in  4 
patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 54/104 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean changes in the echocardiography/Doppler variables were similar in the b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups 
among patients < 2 years and ≥ 2 years of age 
According to the MAH, no conclusion could be drawn from the echocardiography/Doppler assessments 
due to high variability in data collected between the centers. However, as the majority of patients had 
their successive assessments within the study performed in the same investigation center, the analysis 
based on the rate of patients who improved/stabilised/deteriorated should have been possible. 
For completion of the analysis, the MAH will provide the echocardiographic change analysis in relation to 
the clinical outcomes at the end of the 18 months observation period following the completion of the CSR 
of the FUTURE 3 extension study. The MAH will provide this analysis in Q2 2015. This can be considered 
acceptable.  
Hemodynamics: 
The right heart catheter (RHC) subgroup comprised a low number of 10 patients (4 b.i.d., 6 t.i.d.) as only 
patients with the assessment scheduled as per standard hospital practice were to be included for this 
assessment  Additionally,  only  bosentan-naïve  patients  without  open  cardiac  shunt,  and  who  had  no 
diagnosis of Down syndrome, and no serious complication with previous right heart catheterization were 
considered. 
Overall,  the  results  of  changes  in  echocardiography/Doppler  variables  and  hemodynamic  variables 
considered  together  showed  no  consistent  indication  of  effects  favoring  either  the  b.i.d  or  t.i.d.  dose 
regimen although apparent better results in the b.i.d. group as compared to the t.i.d. group could be 
observed. However, the sample size is very limited precluding reliable conclusion.  
Time to PAH worsening: 
PAH worsening was defined with the 2 following definition : 
- Time to first occurrence of death, lung transplantation or hospitalization for PAH-progression.1 
 -  (broader  definition):  Time  to  first  occurrence  of  death,  lung  transplantation,  hospitalization  for 
PAH-progression1, initiation of new therapy for PAH or new/worsening right heart failure. 
1* PAH-progression’ was defined as a definite/irreversible change in the patient’s clinical condition 
related to PAH. This excludes transient changes of the patient’s condition caused by, for example, 
intercurrent  infection  (e.g. :  pneumonia),  surgery  (e.g.,  adenoidectomy),  trauma  etc.  No  further 
requirements  were  imposed  in  the  protocol,  and  the  qualification  of  AEs  as  “PAH-progression” 
remained at the investigator’s discretion. 
During the 24 week duration of the study, ‘PAH-worsening’ (broader definition) was reported for a total of 
4 patients: 3 in the b.i.d. group and one in the t.i.d. Group. 
According to the broader definition, the KM event-free estimate for the worsening of PAH, initiation of new 
therapy for PAH, new right heart failure or worsening of right heart failure at Week 25 was 93.1% i.e. 
89.7% and 96.7% in the b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups, respectively.

FUTURE 3: Time to worsening of PAH (both definition) All-randomized set 
There were no relevant differences between the b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups for time to occurrence of events 
defined within the ‘PAH-worsening cap’. However, the number of worsening events is very low:  only 4 
patients: 3 in the b.i.d. group and one in the t.i.d. group experienced a worsening event. This could relate 
to the low severity at baseline i.e.WHO FC I/II 63.6% in the b.i.d. group and 80.6% in the t.i.d group and 
the short term duration of the study (6 months). Moreover, as concomitant treatment with PAH-specific 
medications were present in more than 54.7% of patients, it is difficult to assess the proper effect of 
bosentan.  
NT-proBNP 
The NT-pro-BNP ratio of geometric means (expressed as percent ratio) of the ‘last post-baseline value up 
to  EOT + 7 days  to  baseline’  was  similar  in  the  b.i.d.  (88.94%,  95%  confidence  limits  [CLs]  62.40, 
126.78)  and  t.i.d.  groups  (83.65%,  95%  CLs  57.88,  120.87),  i.e.,  1.12  and  1.20-fold  decrease  (= 
improvement) in the b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups, respectively. 
Similar results were observed across the age groups.   
The MAH has provided a synthetic table of efficacy results in FUTURE-3.

Efficacy  was  only  exploratory.  However,  clinical  worsening  appeared  similar  in  both  groups  with 
apparently a slightly greater proportion of patients in the b.i.d. group with improvement in WHO FC and 
in Global Clinical Impression Scale (GCIS) as compared to t.i.d.  group. However, slightly more patients 
worsened in the b.i.d. group as compared to t.i.d. group. The MAH states that this could be explained by 
the less severe condition at baseline in the t.i.d. group as compared to the t.i.d. group. This explanation 
cannot be firmly confirmed as this analysis is only exploratory and the present data do not show a benefit 
in increasing the dose from 2 mg/kg b.i.d. to 2mg/kg t.i.d. in children.  
Subgroup analysis in children < 2 years or ≥ 2 years : 
Of the 64 randomized patients, 21 patients were < 2 years and 43 patients were ≥ 2 years of age. The 
median age was 1.2 years (range: 0.3–1.9 years) in patients < 2 years and 6 years (range: 2.1–11.4 
years) in patients ≥ 2 years of age. 
The etiology of PAH (< 2 years vs ≥ 2 years) was idiopathic PAH (38.1% vs 50%), associated PAH (28.6% 
vs 42.9%) and PAH-CHD associated with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (28.6% vs 4.8%).  
The disease condition at baseline (WHO FC) was on  average more severe in patients < 2 years (I/II: 
57.1%, III: 42.9%) than those ≥ 2 years (I/II: 79.1%, III: 20.9%).

NT-pro BNP was available in  19/21 patients  < 2 years and in 39/43 patients > 2 years. Geometric mean 
at baseline was 112.21 UI [range 6-3286] and 45.46 UI [range 4 to 1025]. 
The NT-pro-BNP ratio of geometric means (expressed as percent ratio) of the ‘last post-baseline value up 
to  EOT + 7 days  to  baseline’  was  72.33%,  95%  CLs  40.34, 129.67,  in  patients  <  2  years  of  age  and 
94.3%, 95% CLs 73.15, 121.51 in patients ≥ 2 years of age. 
No statistical analysis has been provided., the results are similar in patients less than 2 years old and 
those older than 2 years. However, the subgroup of patients less than 2 years finally only dealt with 21 
patients from FUTURE-3 study.  
Survival estimates based on pooled analysis of studies performed in children.  
In PAH safety analysis, the overall KM survival estimate was 86.4% at one year and 83.4% at 2 years. An 
analysis by WHO FC showed that survival was influenced by baseline disease severity. In baseline FC II 
patients, the KM survival estimate was 95.8% at one year and 92.9% at 2 years. In FC III patients, the 
KM survival estimate was 69.9% at one year and 65.2% at 2 years.  
It is considered that the interpretation of the survival estimate should be cautious as survival was not 
collected at the same time.

2.6.1.4.  Study AC-052-391 (FUTURE 4) 
Study  title  :    “Pediatric  FormUlation  of  bosenTan  in  pUlmonary  arterial  hypeRtEnsion:  Multicenter, 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  prospective  study  of  bosentan  as  adjunctive  therapy  to 
inhaled nitric oxide in the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.” 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients were 
randomised in 9 centers across 6 countries (Czech Republic, France, South Korea, Poland, UK and USA). 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of bosentan in neonates with PPHN who were in need of 
continued iNO after at least 4 h of continuous iNO treatment. The secondary objectives were to evaluate 
the PK, tolerability, and safety of bosentan in this patient population. 
Term or near-term (gestational age > 34 weeks) hypoxic newborns with respiratory distress refractory to 
supplemental oxygen due to parenchymal lung disease (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, meconium 
aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis without multi-organ failure) were eligible for randomization only 
if they were mechanically ventilated and had been continuously treated with iNO for at least 4 h, and if 
after 4 h of treatment, the requirement for iNO exceeded 10 ppm with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 
≥  50%  under  mechanical  ventilation.  In  addition,  in  order  to  additionally  substantiate  sub-optimal 
response to iNO therapy prior to study drug start, two OI values, recorded at least 30 min. apart, were 
required to be ≥ 12 within 12 h prior to randomization, while the patient was receiving iNO treatment.  
Newborns  with  PPHN  secondary  to  congenital  diaphragmatic  hernia,  with  congenital  cyanotic  heart 
disease or immediate need for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were excluded.  
Patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive, on top of inhaled nitric 
oxide (iNO), either bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. dispersible tablet formulation or matching placebo.  
Study drug was prepared extemporaneously and was administered as a 1.5 mL aqueous dispersion of the 
dispersible tablets, as soon as a nasogastric or orogastric tube placement was possible, but not within the 
first 12 h of the baby’s life. The age was restricted to at least 12 h after birth as patients younger than 12 
h may not be able to absorb study drug. 
Thereafter, study drug was administered approximately every 12 h for a minimum of 2 consecutive days 
(i.e., 4 administrations over 48 h) and may have continued according to the same regimen until 24 h (i.e. 
2 doses) after complete weaning of iNO or until treatment failure (defined as need for ECMO or initiation 
of alternative pulmonary vasodilator). The maximum permitted duration of treatment with bosentan for 
an individual patient was 14 days (regardless of whether there was a need for continued iNO treatment).

Patients disposition  
A sample size of 30 evaluable patients was planned based on feasibility considerations. 
However, due to the rarity of the targeted population, a total of 23 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (N = 15) or placebo (N = 8). 
In 2 (bosentan group) of the 23 randomized patients, study treatment was not administered due to low 
birth weight and transient increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  
Of  the  21  patients  who  received  the  study  drug,  20  (12  bosentan,  8  placebo)  completed  the  study 
treatment (i.e.: two doses after successful iNO weaning). One patient in the bosentan group discontinued 
study treatment prematurely due to treatment failure on Day 1 (need for ECMO [protocol-defined]). 
Figure 3 
Disposition of patients in the FUTURE 4 study 
Demographics: 
The  demographics  were  balanced  between  bosentan  and  placebo  groups.  The  population  was 
predominantly  female  (69.2%  bosentan,  75.0%  placebo)  and  Caucasian  (84.6%  bosentan,  75.0% 
placebo). The length and weight at birth were similar in both groups 
The etiology of PPHN was predominantly parenchymal lung disease in both groups (100%  bosentan (13 
patients), 62.5% placebo (5patients)). Idiopathic PPHN was diagnosed for 3 patients in the placebo group 
(37.5%). 
The gestational age (median, min–max) was similar between bosentan (40.0 weeks, 
36.0–41.0 weeks) and placebo (38.5 weeks, 36.0-42.0 weeks).  
The age (median, min–max) at first dosing with the study treatment was similar in the bosentan group 
(1.4 days, 0.6–5.6 days) and in the placebo group (1.7 days, 0.6–5.9 days). The age (median, min–max) 
at PPHN diagnosis was 13.1 h (2.0–33.9 h) in the bosentan group and 18.1 h (4.0–43.0 h) in the placebo 
group.

OI = Oxygenation Index 
Appendix 4, Table 5 
Baseline OI (median [min–max]) values indicated that the disease condition was more severe in patients 
randomized to bosentan (18.3 [5.9–44.3]) than in patients randomized to placebo (13.2 [7.1–39.4]). 
Consistently, median baseline alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2; min–max) was 481.0 mmHg 
(177.8–606.9  mmHg)  in  the  bosentan  group  and  429.0  mmHg  (255.8–619.3  mmHg)  in  the  placebo 
group. 
The median time (min–max) from iNO initiation to start of study treatment was 20.7 h (7.9–115.5 h) in 
the bosentan group versus 23.5 h (6.0–118.2 h) in the placebo group.  
The median dose of iNO (min–max) at study drug initiation was 20 ppm in both groups (Bosentan: 20 
ppm [13–20 ppm], placebo: 20 ppm [10–20 ppm]).

FUTURE-4 Efficacy results: 
Median duration on bosentan was 4.5 days (range: 0.5–10.0 days) and median duration on placebo was 
4.0 days (range: 2.5–6.5 days). 
The efficacy endpoints of the study were exploratory. No formal hypothesis testing was predefined. 
• 
Primary endpoints:  
– 
Proportion  of  patients  with  treatment  failure  defined  as  the  need  for  ECMO  or  initiation  of 
alternative pulmonary vasodilator 
–  Time to complete weaning from iNO 
–  Time to weaning from mechanical ventilation. 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  proportion  of  patients  requiring  re-initiation  of  iNO 
therapy, change from baseline to various time points in OI, arterial blood gas (ABG) values, pulse 
oximetry (SpO2), FiO2, AaDO2 and the presence of pulmonary hypertension. 
• 
Treatment failures: 
One patient in the bosentan group had treatment failure (need for ECMO as per protocol definition), which 
was declared based on increasing OI values within 8 h after the first dose of study drug.  This patient with 
PPHN due to parenchymal lung disease (neonatal aspiration) had been on iNO therapy for 8 h at study 
drug start (initial dose 10 ppm, dose at study drug start 16 ppm).  All other patients were successfully 
weaned from iNO. No patient required reinitiation of iNO.

Even  though  treatment  comparisons  for  both  weaning-related  primary  endpoints  resulted  in  p-values 
greater than 0.05 it was observed that 3 patients randomized to bosentan had longer iNO and mechanical 
ventilation  weaning  times  than  all  other  patients,  resulting  in  longer  median  times  to  weaning  in  the 
bosentan randomized group. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Changes  in  oxygen  index  (OI),  arterial  blood  gas  (ABG)  variables,  SpO2,  FiO2  and  alveolar-arterial 
oxygen difference (AaDO2) over time were similar in the bosentan and placebo groups. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  pulmonary  hypertension  at  end  of  treatment  (EOT)  was  comparable 
between treatment groups (41.7% bosentan, 37.5% placebo).  
No patients had re-initiation of iNO. 
CHMP comments:  
In this first randomized, placebo-controlled trial performed to investigate the effect of bosentan as add-on 
therapy to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in neonates with PPHN and who did not adequately respond to iNO, 
no additional benefit of bosentan treatment was observed.  
Although not statistically different between the 2 groups, the mean time to complete weaning from iNO 
and  from  mechanical  ventilation  appeared  longer  in  the  bosentan  group  as  compared  to  the  placebo 
group. 
This study was well conducted although sample size is limited (only 13 patients treated with bosentan less 
than 14 days). The design of this study as add-on therapy to the iNO, the mainstay treatment of PPHN, 
was well appropriate and efficacy assessments in this study were standard assessments performed for 
patients with PPHN.  
The  median  baseline  OI  and  AaDO2  indicated  that  the  disease  condition  was  slightly  more  severe  in 
patients  randomized  to  bosentan  than  in  patients  randomized  to  placebo  in  this  study  (OI:  18.3  in 
bosentan-group  versus  13.2  on  placebo;  AaDO2:  481.0  mmHg  in  the  bosentan  group  versus  429.0 
mmHg on placebo). Based on a post hoc exploratory analyses where baseline OI was found to be strongly 
related to time to weaning from iNO, influencing the treatment effect for this endpoint, the study report 
states  that  the  difference  in  baseline  OI  between  the  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  could  explain  the

apparent  difference  in  point  estimates  for  time  to  iNO  weaning.  Larger  population  studied  would  be 
needed to allow reliable assessment. It is pointed out that 3 patients randomized to bosentan had longer 
iNO and mechanical ventilation weaning times than all other patients.

2.6.2.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data in children less than 12 years provided in support of this application are derived from 
FUTURE  1  (AC-052-365)  and  its  extension  (FUTURE 2 ;  AC-052-367),  and  the  recently  completed 
FUTURE 3 (AC-052-373).  
In addition, data are presented for a placebo controlled study newly conducted with 32 mg dispersible 
tablets  in  neonates  with  persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of  the  newborn  (PPHN;  FUTURE  4 ; 
AC-052-391). 
PAH and PPHN are considered separately as their clinical features, etiology and outcome are different.   
PAH in children : 
In PAH children less than 12 years, efficacy was assessed exclusively based on exploratory endpoints in 
2  open  label  and  not  controlled  studies.  They  present  several  limitations  with  regards  to  the  efficacy 
endpoints which were exploratory and their appropriateness to properly assess bosentan effect (open 
label, important proportion of patients with combined associated treatment, doubt on lack of sensitivity). 
Moreover, data in children less than 2 years are limited (21 children with PK data only for 4 patients). 
The newly provided FUTURE-3 study did not show any clinical benefit when using a dose higher than 2 
mg/kg  b.i.d.  (i.e.:  2  mg/kg  t.i.d.)  over  the  24  weeks  period,  which  is  consistent  with  the  systemic 
exposure remaining similar in both b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups, comparable to the 4mg/kg b.i.d. dosing.  
The  clinical  studies  using  the  32  mg  dispersible  tablets  are  not  robust  to  document  the  efficacy  in 
paediatric pulmonary hypertension. The limit of age where PK profile differs from adults and where it 
could be considered as similar to adults remains undetermined.  
In this  context, informing prescribers on the data available in children (especially with regards to the 
specificity of PK and plateau dosings as compared to adults) appears justified. 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 
Treatment with iNO is the mainstay for PPHN with proven efficacy. In the majority of infants, an acute 
improvement in oxygenation can be expected within 30 to 60 min of initiation of iNO at a dose of around 
20 ppm regardless of the severity of the illness. Inhaled NO is recommended as the first line treatment of 
PPHN.  In  some  cases,  infants  may  not  exhibit  improved  oxygenation  or  a  satisfactory  and  sustained 
response to iNO.  
FUTURE-4  is  the  first  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  study  investigating  the  effect  of 
bosentan (2 mg/kg b.i.d.) as add-on therapy to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in neonates with PPHN and 
suboptimal response to inhaled NO.  
Future 4 study was well conducted  and used an appropriate design assessing bosentan as add-on therapy 
to the iNO, the mainstay treatment of PPHN. However the sample size of 21 patients (13 treated with 
bosentan, 8 with placebo) is limited.

The pharmacokinetics of bosentan in neonates with PPHN were characterized by variable exposure, which 
was  low  after  the  first  dose  and  attained  apparent  steady-state  within  5  days.  The  systemic 
concentrations at steady-state of bosentan and its metabolites were higher than those studied previously 
in older pediatric PAH patients ≥ 3 months of age, but similar to those observed in adult PAH patients 
treated with 125 mg b.i.d. 
Overall, this study showed that there was no benefit in adding bosentan on top of inhaled NO in neonates 
who did not adequately respond to inhaled NO. The mean time to complete weaning from iNO and from 
mechanical  ventilation  appeared  longer  in  the  bosentan  group  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  In 
conclusion, based on this study, the use of bosentan cannot be recommended in the standard care of 
PPHN.  
Bosentan appeared well tolerated but the number of patients contributing to the safety data in the PPHN 
safety set was low (13 bosentan vs 8 placebo), and bosentan exposure was very short-term (≤ 10 days 
treatment;  median  exposure  4.5  days  ranging  from  0.5  to  10  days).  AEs  and  laboratory  data  were 
consistent with the known safety profile of bosentan. Anemia, including anemia requiring transfusion, was 
the  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  adverse  effect.  There  were  no  aminotransferase 
elevations > 2 × ULN during the treatment-emergent period (i.e. from first study drug dose until 7 days 
after last study drug dose).  
The section 4.2. of the SmPC is amended to mention that no recommendation on a posology can be made 
in neonates with PPHN and key data from FUTURE-4 are added in section 5.2.  
Due to the major objection on efficacy raised, the claim for indication in section 4.1. in children from 3 
months to 2 years was subsequently withdrawn by the MAH. 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety data provided by the MAH in support of this application consist of: 
 - an integrated safety analysis for the 100 paediatric PAH patients, aged 3 months to 12 years who took 
at least one dose of bosentan using dispersible tablets throughout the 2 open label studies:  
- FUTURE-1 (12 weeks, single arm, 36 patients included) with its completed extension FUTURE 2, 
- FUTURE 3 (24 weeks, 64 patients included) with data from its ongoing extension with cut-off 
date up to 19 August 2013.  
- the safety data in neonates from the placebo-controlled FUTURE 4 study conducted in patients with 
persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of  the  newborn  (PPHN)  (13  Tracleer  patients  versus  8  placebo 
included). 
-  a  review  of  post-marketing  data,  including  spontaneous  reports  (including  those  from  regulatory 
authorities  and  literature)  and  solicited  reports  (including  named  patient  /  compassionate  use, 
investigator-initiated/-sponsored trials (cut-off date: 19 November 2013). 
a- Safety data from clinical trials   
The designs of studies FUTURE-1/2, FUTURE-3 and FUTURE-4 are described individually and in details in 
the above section Efficacy 
Exposure in the pooled PAH safety analysis set:  
Given the limited number of PAH children from the individual studies, the applicant has presented the 
analysis of safety data cumulatively over the core and extension periods, based on the start of study 
treatment in the core study.  
The pooled PAH safety analysis set comprising 100 children from 3 months to 11.4 years at baseline (57 
male; 43 females).  
The median age of the patients was 5.2 years (ranging from 0.3 to 11.7 years), with 21 patients < 2 years 
of age (all issued from FUTURE-3).

Dosings were different in FUTURE ½ (4 mg/kg b.i.d.) and FUTURE 3 (i.e. 2 mg/kg b.i.d. or 2 mg/kg t.i.d.). 
As  similarity  in  systemic  exposure  was  observed  in  the  PK  analysis,  pooling  the  data  for  safety 
assessment can be considered acceptable. FUTURE-3 allow direct safety comparison of increasing the 
dosings above 2 mg/kg b.i.d. i.e. 2 mg/kg t.i.d. in children. The sample size is however limited to 100 
patients.  
The median duration of exposure to bosentan treatment in the pooled PAH population was 71.8 weeks i.e. 
16.8 months (ranging from 0.4 weeks to 258 weeks i.e. 5.0 years), with 64 of patients exposed for at 
least 12 months and 33 exposed for at least 18 months.  
The median duration of exposure to bosentan treatment was 27.1 weeks i.e. 6.3 months (ranging from 
0.4 weeks to 77.1 weeks i.e.18.0 months) in patients < 2 years of age and 73.9 weeks i.e. 17.2 months 
(ranging from 8.4 weeks to 258 weeks i.e. 5.0 years) in patients ≥ 2 years of age. 
Exposure in PPHN patients (FUTURE 4) 
13 neonates (9 females and 4 males) received bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. and 8 neonates (6 females and 2 
males) received placebo.  
The gestational age (median, min–max)  was similar for bosentan (40.0 weeks ranging from 36 to 41 
weeks) and placebo (38.5 weeks ranging from 36 to 42 weeks).  
The etiology of PPHN was predominantly parenchymal lung disease in both groups (100%  bosentan (13 
patients), 62.5% placebo (5patients)). Idiopathic PPHN was diagnosed for 3 patients in the placebo group 
(37.5%). 
The median exposure (days, min–max) in this short-term study was similar in the bosentan (4.5 days, 
0.5–10.0 days) and placebo groups (4.0 days, 2.5–6.5 days). Approximately 60.0% of patients in the 
bosentan and placebo groups had at least 4 days of exposure to study treatment. 
It is considered that the safety analysis set from these clinical studies using the 32 mg dispersible tablet 
doesn't allow assessment of the safety profile in patients with the exclusion criteria applied e.g., patients 
with severe renal function impairment, patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (missing 
information). 
B) Overall AE profile 
Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
The most frequently reported AEs in the pooled PAH safety analysis set were associated with disorders of 
the  respiratory  system  (69.0%),  particularly  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (RTI;  25%).  Other  AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 84/104 
 
  
  
 
 
associated with infections of the upper respiratory tract/system included nasopharyngitis (17%), viral 
upper RTI (5%), pharyngitis (4%), and tonsillitis (3.0%). Regarding other RTIs, bronchitis was reported 
for 10% of patients, pneumonia for 7%, viral RTI for 5%, influenza and RTI were reported for 4% of 
patients each, and bronchopneumonia for 3%. 
Worsening of PAH or pulmonary hypertension (PH) were reported for 14% and 6% patients, respectively. 
Cough was reported for 9% of patients, most frequently in association with an RTI. Two patients each 
experienced dyspnea and wheezing, and one patient experienced exertional dyspnea. 
CHMP comments 
From this pooled analysis, AEs are similar in nature to that generally seen in adults. However, a higher 
rate of AEs associated with the infections and infestations system organ class, with upper respiratory tract 
infections being the most frequently reported, was observed (adulte around 41.3% reported in pooled 
clinical studies). The MAH considered that this may in part be due to the longer median exposure in the 
pediatric  set  (71.8  weeks,  range:  0.4–258.0  weeks)  compared  to  the  adult  set  (17.4  weeks,  range: 
0.7–74 weeks) and the higher incidence of acute respiratory infections in children compared to adults in 
the  general  population.  This  explanation  is  plausible,  but  as  the  studies    were  not  controlled,  this 
explanation cannot be confirmed and a specific effect of bosentan cannot be formally excluded.  
PPHN safety analysis set 
In this short-term study, the most frequently reported AEs in patients treated with bosentan were anemia 
and generalized oedema. Anemia was reported as an AE for 3 bosentan-treated patients and one 
placebo-treated patient. Anemia and/or laboratory hemoglobin decreases to below the lower limit of 
normal were reported for a total of 7 patients on bosentan (53.8%) and 2 patients on placebo (25.0%). 
Generalized edema was reported in 3 patients on bosentan, all of whom had received multiple plasma 
expanders / intravenous (i.v.) fluid supplementation on days preceding the event onset. 
No treatment-emergent AEs of aminotransferase elevations (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) were reported. 
c)  Deaths,  other  serious  adverse  events  and  AEs 
discontinuation 
leading  to  treatment 
Deaths- Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
The analysis of deaths in the pooled PAH safety set included those that occurred up to 2 years after the 
End  of  Treatment  (EOT)  for  patients  in  FUTURE  2.  Overall,  17  patients  (17%)  died,  with  14  of  these 
deaths occurring during the study treatment period, or resulting from an AE that commenced during the 
study treatment period. In addition, there were 3 deaths that occurred during long-term follow-up. 
The  causes  of  death  were  consistent  with  what  has  been  previously  reported  in  bosentan  studies 
conducted in pediatric and adult PAH populations, i.e., were predominantly associated with events related 
to  progression  of  PAH.  Other  causes  of  death  were  represented  by  single  patients,  and  none  were 
associated with hepatobiliary events, anemia or edema. In addition, there were no cases that indicated 
the occurrence of any previously unrecognized potentially fatal AEs associated with bosentan treatment. 
Of the 3 deaths that occurred during the long-term follow-up period, one was due to worsening of the 
underlying disease. Of the other 2 deaths, one resulted from multi-organ failure related to unspecified 
congenital  metabolic  disease,  and  the  third  was  due  to  complications  associated  with  cardiac 
catheterization.  
Survival rate in the pooled PAH safety analysis set 
The MAH has provided KM survival estimate for the pooled PAH safety analysis.  The KM estimate survival 
was 86.4% at one year and 83.4% at 2 years  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 85/104 
 
  
  
Survival was influenced by baseline severity. In baseline FC II patients, the KM survival estimate was 
95.8% at one year and 92.9% at 2 years. In FC III patients, the KM survival estimate was 69.9% at one 
year and 65.2% at 2 years.

CHMP comments : 
This  KM  estimates  from  the  PAH  studies  using  the  dispersible  tablets    (FUTURE  1/2  and  FUTURE  3) 
showed an improvement  in survival as compared to prior to the introduction of vasodilator therapy where 
mean survival time for children after diagnosis of IPAH was less than 12 months. However, it is noticed 
that  more  than  50  %  of  the  patients  were  receiving  combined  treatment  associated  to  bosentan  in 
FUTURE 3. Moreover, it includes the collection up to 2 years after the End of Treatment (EOT) for patients 
in FUTURE 2. In most of them combined therapy including sildenafil will have been introduced. Therefore, 
these results may be overoptimistic but not solely relating to the use of bosentan.  
PPHN safety analysis set 
No deaths were reported in the FUTURE 4 study. 
d) Serious adverse events 
Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
A total of 44 (44%) of the patients experienced at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) in the pooled PAH 
safety analysis set. The most frequently reported SAE was worsening of PAH, reported as the PTs PAH 
(9.0%),  PH  (3.0%)  and  right  ventricular  failure  (2.0%).  Other  frequently  reported  SAEs  were 
broncho-pneumonia / pneumonia / viral pneumonia (7.0%), device-related infection and syncope (3.0% 
each).  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 86/104 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAEs associated with cardiac disorders (other than right ventricular failure) included cardiac failure (2 
patients), cardiac arrest, acute cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, and pericardial effusion (1 patient 
each). 
SAEs  of  iron  deficiency  anemia  and  decreased  hemoglobin  were  reported  in  1  patient.  The  patient 
prematurely discontinued the FUTURE 2 study by withdrawal of consent. 
An  SAE  of  autoimmune  hepatitis  was  reported  that  resulted  in  premature  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment, as well as discontinuation from the study. The patient had ALT > 3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) on Day 273 (171 U/L) and ALT > 5 × ULN accompanied by AST > 3 × ULN on Day 341 (299 U/L 
and 144 U/L, respectively). Bilirubin remained within the reference range. The event was reported as 
resolved  on  follow-up  approximately  2.5  months  after  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  The 
investigator assessed the event as related to study drug administration. 
The majority of the treatment-emergent SAEs were reported as resolved on follow-up and assessed by 
the investigator as unrelated to study drug administration 
The CHMP noted that as immune hepatitis were also reported in adults, a review of immune hepatitis 
cases has been requested in the next PSUR.  
PPHN safety analysis set 
A  total  of  2  (15.4%)  patients  on  bosentan  and  3 (37.5%)  patients  on  placebo  experienced 
treatment-emergent  SAEs.  In  one  bosentan-treated  patient,  the  SAEs  were  ongoing  conditions  of 
circulatory collapse, hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis that led to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug within one day of study drug initiation (considered as treatment failure as per protocol and likely 
reflecting worsening of the underlying PPHN). A treatment-emergent abnormality on hepatic ultrasound 
(reported as unspecified reactive hepatitis) was reported in the second bosentan-treated patient 3 days 
after EOT; ALT and AST remained < 2 × ULN. Two patients on placebo had SAEs of pneumothorax, and 
one patient had sepsis reported as an SAE. All treatment-emergent SAEs were reported as resolved on 
follow-up and assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study drug administration. 
During the follow-up period, 8 days after EOT, neonatal hepatitis was reported for a patient who had been 
on bosentan treatment for 5.5 days. Peak ALT elevations (10.7 × ULN) were reached on the 17th day 
after study drug discontinuation with total bilirubin of 1.2 × ULN. The event resolved without sequelae 6 
weeks later. The investigator assessed the event as related to study drug administration. 
The CHMP noted that the sample size of neonates is limited to 13 patients to draw reliable conclusion on 
safety in neonates.  
e) AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment 
Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
A total of 17 patients (17%) had at least one AE that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment, and 
the AEs were also reported as SAEs for 14 of these patients. 
The AEs leading to discontinuation that were not reported as SAEs were abnormal liver function test (2 
patients) and exertional dyspnea (one patient).  
PPHN safety analysis set 
One patient discontinued study treatment in the FUTURE 4 study. The patient discontinued due to 3 AEs 
that were also reported as SAEs (circulatory collapse, hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis). The AEs 
satisfied the protocol-defined criteria for treatment failure and automatically led to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment.

f) Safety topics of special interest 
Anemia / hemoglobin decrease, Liver abnormalities and Edema in the pooled PAH safety analysis set were 
evaluated on the basis of treatment-emergent AEs  
•  Anemia/hemoglobin decrease  
Pooled PAH safety analysis set :  
Hemoglobin concentrations < 10 g/dL were reported for 10 patients (5 of whom were bosentan naïve), 
and were reported as AEs in 2 cases, one of which was an SAE and was associated with an SAE of iron 
deficiency anemia. The patient subsequently withdrew consent. No patient had a decrease in hemoglobin 
to a concentration < 8 g/dL. 
PPHN safety analysis set 
AEs of anemia and/or laboratory hemoglobin decreases to below the lower limit of the normal range were 
reported for a total of 7 patients on bosentan (53.8%) and 2 patients on placebo (25.0%). Four of the 7 
bosentan-treated patients, and one of the 2 placebo-treated patients received blood transfusions. Of the 
7 bosentan-treated  patients,  2  had  generalized  edema  concomitantly  and  one  had  thrombocytopenia 
concomitantly  (this  patient  had  ongoing  anemia  and  thrombocytopenia  at  baseline).  For  5  of  the  7 
bosentan-treated  patients,  the  anemia  /  decreased  hemoglobin  occurred  following  administration  of 
human albumin as a plasma volume expander. It is notable that prior to study drug administration, 6 of 
the 21 patients (3 subsequently on bosentan and 3 on placebo) received a red-blood-cell transfusion. 
•  Liver abnormalities 
Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
Liver  abnormality  AEs  were  reported  for  a  total  of  9  patients,  and  were  associated  with 
treatment–emergent increases in ALT to > 3 × ULN in 2 cases (one case 7.3 × ULN associated with an 
SAE of autoimmune hepatitis). None of these elevations were accompanied by bilirubin elevations. Three 
patients had isolated/intermittent hyperbilirubinemia, which was not associated with an aminotransferase 
increase  or  other  hepatic  event.  With  the  exception  of  autoimmune  hepatitis  (considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  treatment),  none  of  the  liver  abnormality  AEs  were  reported  as 
SAEs. 
PPHN safety analysis set 
No  aminotransferase  elevations  >  3 × ULN  were  reported  during  study  treatment.  In  3 patients  (1 
bosentan, 2 placebo), total bilirubin increased from within the reference range at baseline to values above 
ULN (worst post-baseline); all were < 2 × ULN, and none were associated with elevated ALT. 
After discontinuation of bosentan treatment, there were 2 reports of hepatitis. One of these was transient 
unspecified reactive hepatitis reported on Day 8, 3 days after treatment discontinuation. The diagnosis 
was based on an abnormal hepatic ultrasound appearance associated with increased C-reactive protein, 
and was not supported by liver test results. Ultimately, the abnormal hepatic ultrasound appearance was 
suspected to be associated with the umbilical line placement. The event was reported as resolved with 
sequelae 2 weeks later. 
The  second  case  was  reported  as  neonatal  hepatitis  with  maximum  aminotransferase  elevations  of 
approximately  10 × ULN  and  bilirubin  slightly  above  the  ULN  (1.2 × ULN)  17  days  after  the  end  of 
bosentan  treatment.  The  event  was  reported  as  resolved  without  sequelae  6  weeks  later,  when 
aminotransferases  were  approximately  2 × ULN  and  bilirubin  was  within  the  reference  range.  The 
investigator assessed the event as related to study drug administration.

•  Edema 
Pooled PAH safety analysis set 
Peripheral edema was reported in 2 patients, one in the context of PAH progression leading to death and 
the other was an ongoing AE that was reported in the patient’s medical history. One patient had face 
edema reported concurrently with AEs of worsening chest pain and abdominal pain. 
PPHN safety analysis set 
Generalized edema was reported in 3 patients on bosentan, all of whom had received multiple plasma 
expanders / intravenous. fluid supplementation on days preceding the event onset.

In the pooled PAH analysis set, the overall proportion of patients with AEs was similar in patients aged < 
2 years and those aged ≥ 2 years. There were some apparent differences in the pattern of events between 
the age groups, although the smaller number of patients aged < 2 years and the difference in the 
developmental stage of the children in the two groups makes it difficult to accurately compare the 
findings. 
The main differences between the age groups were in relation to liver abnormalities and anemia / 
decreased hemoglobin. Of the 9 patients with liver abnormality AEs, 8 were aged ≥ 2 years. In the 
patients aged < 2 years, there was one AE of increased bilirubin, and this was not associated with an 
aminotransferase increase. All cases of decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit and anemia were 
reported in patients ≥ 2 years of age. Gastroenteritis AEs were reported more frequently in the younger 
patients (19.0%) compared to those aged ≥ 2 years (7.6%). 
CHMP comments: The sample size of patients less than 2 years is limited to 21 patients precluding firm 
conclusion.   
•  Sex 
No clinically relevant influence of sex on exposure to bosentan has been observed in pharmacokinetic 
studies in adults, particularly when corrected for body weight. Due to the small number of (predominantly 
female) neonates in the FUTURE 4 PPHN safety analysis set, and the high variability seen in the PK 
parameters, a subgroup analysis by sex was not performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 89/104 
 
  
  
•  Race/ethnicity 
In the pooled PAH safety analysis, the vast majority (80%) of the patients were Caucasian. Of the 
remaining patients, 10% were Asian, 4% were Black, 3% were Hispanic and 3% were ‘Other’. In the 
FUTURE 4 PPHN safety analysis set, 11/13 of the bosentan group were Caucasian, and 6/8 of the placebo 
group were Caucasian. Therefore, given the small number of patients from any particular racial/ethnicity 
category (other than Caucasian), it was considered that evaluation on the basis of race/ethnicity would 
not be meaningful for either analysis set. 
•  Growth 
The mean and median changes from baseline in the height Z-scores were small, and the direction of 
change was generally positive. Mean height-for-age Z-scores were slightly below 0 both at baseline and 
EOS / premature discontinuation of study drug, indicating a somewhat lower height for age than expected 
in healthy children. 
The growth profiles were consistent with the underlying disease condition of patients, an observation 
consistent with the data from the systematic review of PAH registries conducted by the sponsor. 
CHMP comments: Growth is an indicator of health in children with PAH but the available data presented 
from this pooled analysis are limited. Based on the  presentation of the MAH,  no detrimental effect of 
bosentan is shown.   
•  Dose frequency (t.i.d vs b.i.d) 
The effect of increasing the dose frequency from b.i.d. to t.i.d. was assessed in FUTURE 3. No additional 
clinical benefit was observed. 
h) Post marketing  
Non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies in the pediatric population 
AC-052-516 – Systematic review of pediatric registries 
Disease characteristics and outcomes of pulmonary arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in 
real-world clinical settings: systematic review of four prospective, observational registries. 
The Fourth Annual Report of this systematic review was completed on 17 December 2013 and was 
submitted in parallel to this procedure.  
CHMP comment:  
As a reminder, the third annual report referred to cumulative data from 15 October 2009 to 15 September 
2012. A total of 547 patients had been included in the 4 registries constituting the Enrolled analysis set 
(EAS). At least one follow-up visit was available for 458 of them (constituting the Full analysis Set (FAS) 
among which 218 were treated with Tracleer. 
On average, patients had been exposed to Tracleer for at least 20 months with a quarter of patients 
having been exposed to Tracleer for more than 30 months (2.5 years). Approximately half the children 
treated with Tracleer received more than the dose recommended in the SmPC (i.e. ≥ 4 mg/kg). 
Thirty-two patients had been treated with Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablet formulation. 
Data on sexual maturation was mainly reported from TOPP registry (158 patients with Tracleer having 
reached sexual maturation). The available data suggested that Tracleer had few, if any, impact on general 
development and sexual maturation. Conclusions of the AR  was that no new safety signal emerged from 
the data collected in these registries. A higher event rate was observed in comparison to previous reports 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 90/104 
 
  
  
 
but this may be explained by the change in definition of end of observation leading to a shorter follow-up 
period and consequently to a higher rate. This should be confirmed within the next annual reports. 
It is considered premature to stop the long-term collection of safety and clinical data with bosentan. 
Enrollment is still ongoing in TOPP, NL and FR registries, and it was agreed that PAH children should be 
followed-up until puberty, in order to get information on sexual maturity.  
Consequently, the CHMP is of opinion that the MAH should continue the registries to monitor PAH children 
patients and provide additional systematic review of paediatric registries annually. The frequency of 
submission of systematic review of paediatric registries may be amended following the assessment report 
of the fifth report.  
The MAH is requested to submit the fifth annual report within 3 months of the CHMP opinion. The following 
issues should be addressed in the next annual report: 
- 
All events and first event rates of PAH related and non-PAH related hospitalisation in the Tracleer 
are higher than in the whole registry population, for both TOPP and NL registries. This was already 
observed in the previous periods. A higher rate of PAH retaled events might reflect a non-optimal 
treatment of the PAH with Tracleer in the paediatric population as well as the non-PAH related 
events might reflect a lower tolerance of the product compared to other PAH treatment. The MAH 
should discuss this finding in the next report. 
-  Regarding  events  of  hepatic  disorders  and  haemoglobin  decreased,  the  MAH  should  provide 
additional data (e.g. patients’ age, Tracleer dose, Tracleer treatment duration, outcome, time to 
onset…). 
-  During the reviewed period, 42/233 (18% of patients) in the TOPP registry discontinued Tracleer 
treatment. The MAH states that reasons are provided for 38 patients but only provides the 2 most 
common specific reasons (i.e. PAH improvement (8 patients) and cost or access (6 patients)). The 
MAH should provide more details regarding reasons for discontinuing treatment with Tracleer. In 
addition, 7 patients in the TOPP registry (including 2 Tracleer patients) died from known reasons 
not PAH-related. Details of these cases should be provided. 
Post-marketing safety experience in paediatric patients with PAH 
The number of patients exposed to bosentan during the post-marketing period (for all age groups) is 
estimated via controlled distribution systems or from the number of packages sold in USA.  
Cumulatively, the proportional distribution of events per SOC was generally similar for both groups, 
adults elderly and paediatric patients .The majority of AEs arose from the following four SOCs: General 
Disorders and administration site conditions (including ‘death’ and lack of efficacy), Infections and 
infestations, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and Investigations (60.6% in the paediatric 
population vs 58.4% in the adult/elderly population). The distribution of AEs by SOC in pediatric patients 
revealed a higher proportion of Infections and infestations (11.8% vs 6.8%), and Surgical and medical 
procedures (6.0% vs 2.9%), compared to the adult/elderly population. Regarding events from the 
Infections and infestations SOC, respiratory tract infections were the most predominant. Cumulatively, 
both upper (8.8% of pediatric cases vs 4.3% of adult/elderly cases) and lower respiratory tract infections 
(7.9% of pediatric cases vs 6.2% of adult/elderly cases) appeared more frequent in the pediatric 
population. 
Overall, the reporting rate for hepatobiliary events/investigations in the pediatric population from IBD (20 
November 2001) to 19 November 2013 was 5.5% . The overall estimated reporting rate for hepatobiliary 
events/investigations  in  the  non-paediatric  population  was  6.0%.  All  hepatic  events  were  extensively 
reviewed,  and  the  findings  were  consistent  with  the  conclusions  of  the  completed  European  Tracleer 
post-marketing  surveillance  (PMS)  programme  (with  data  to  19  November  2004),  namely  that  the 
pediatric population did not seem to be at increased risk of developing liver injury while on bosentan 
treatment compared to the adult/elderly population (incidence of abnormal liver tests 2.7% in 2–12 year 
olds,  7.8%  in  patients  >  12  years).  A  lower  incidence  of  liver  injury  in  pediatric  PAH  patients  was 
supported by the medical literature [Beghetti 2009a, Beghetti 2009b, Moledina 2010]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 91/104 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The  cumulative  reporting  rate  of  events  denoting  anemia  was  similar  between  pediatric  (1.2%)  and 
adult/elderly patients (1.9%). 
Since IBD, 18,557 reports of death (regardless of causality) were received and entered into Argus. The 
cumulative number of reported deaths expressed as a percentage of treated pediatric patients [11.6%] is 
similar to that of all ages (13.8%) and to adult/elderly patients [13.71%]. These cumulative estimated 
reporting rates of death are also comparable with the overall rate of 17% seen in the pooled analysis of 
children with PAH aged 3 months to 12 years. 
Overall conclusion of post-marketing data: 
There was no increase in the proportion of reported events in pediatric patients from any events of special 
interest compared to adults.  
The analysis of the cumulative data shows that the safety profile of bosentan in pediatric PAH patients is 
consistent with the known safety profile of bosentan in adult/elderly PAH patients. A similar safety profile 
in children and adults was also supported in an overview of three clinical studies including 423 pediatric 
patients treated with bosentan for PAH [Beghetti 2009a, Beghetti 2009b, Carter 2010], and in the pooled 
analysis of children with PAH aged 3 months to 12 years. 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  reporting  ratio  and  the  distribution  of  event  per  SOC  are 
consistent between pediatric and adult/elderly population. 
The reporting rate of serious cases is globally similar between paediatric and adult/elderly populations 
(overall reporting rate of serious events: 30% or 1 per 3.3 paediatric subjects and 28.9% or 1 per 3.5 
adult/elderly subjects).  
The overall proportion of serious and non-serious cases in paediatric and adult/elderly populations was 
comparable with a slightly higher ratio of serious case in the paediatric population (63.2% and 56.5% of 
cases reported as serious, respectively), with a higher proportion of serious cases in patients < 2 years 
old  (infants/neonates:  76.1%;  507/666),  compared  with  paediatric  subjects  above  2 years  (58.8%; 
1143/1944),  
The  higher  differences  between  these  2  populations is  observed  in  the  SOC  Respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (66,7% events reported in this SOC are serious in the paediatric population vs 48% 
in the adult/elderly population). As mentioned by the MAH, respiratory conditions are the most frequent 
reason  for  admission  to  the  hospital  in  the  children  population  (Hao  2009),  this  may  explain  this 
discrepancy between the populations. 
Reporting ratios of fatal outcome are consistent between children aged form 3 month to 2 years (12%), 
overall paediatric (11,6%) and adult/elderly population (13,8%). When it is known, the cause of death in 
the paediatric population is more probably related to the underlying disease and conditions than to the 
treatment with bosentan, and this is as well observed in the adult/elderly population. 
Regarding the analysis in children aged from 3 months to 2 years provided by the MAH, the available data 
do not show specific safety concern in this population. 
In summary, no specific risk emerged from post marketing data in children as compared to adults related 
to the use of bosentan.  
2.7.1.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical safety 
The pooled pediatric safety analysis set from FUTURE-1/2 and FUTURE 3 in 100 PAH patients showed 
similar AEs in nature to that generally seen in adults. However, a higher rate of AEs associated with the 
infections and infestations system organ class, with upper respiratory tract infections being the most 
frequently reported appeared more frequent in the pediatric population as compared to adults.   
This may in part be due to the longer median exposure in the pediatric set (71.8 weeks, range: 0.4–258.0 
weeks) compared to the adult set (17.4 weeks, range: 0.7–74 weeks) and the higher incidence of acute 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015

respiratory  infections  in  children  compared  to  adults  in  the  general  population.  This  explanation  is 
acceptable for CHMP, however given that the studies were not controlled; a specific effect of bosentan 
cannot be formally excluded.  
Based on post marketing data, bosentan appeared to be used frequently in children (out of label). The 
reporting ratio and the distribution of event per SOC are consistent between paediatric and adult/elderly 
population. 
The safety data in children aged from 3 months to 2 years do not show specific safety concern in this 
population. 
No  specific  safety  risk  emerged  from  the  safety  data  provided  in  neonates  and  in  older  children  as 
compared to adults related to the use of bosentan.  
Reduced testis weight associated with reduced number of sperms and reduced epididymides weights were 
observed in the newly provided non clinical study conducted in juvenile rats. A slight increased incidence 
of testicular tubular atrophy (effect also observed with the other ERAs macitentan and ambrisentan) was 
shown in a toxicity study in rats after 2 years of treatment with bosentan. A clinical study designed to 
specifically  investigate  the  effects  of  bosentan  treatment  on  testicular  function  in  male  PAH  human 
patients (Study AC-052-402) showed no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility but 8 out of 24 
male patients had a decreased sperm concentration of at least 42% from baseline after 3 or 6 months of 
treatment with bosentan. Two of these 8 patients showed a sperm concentration lower than 15×106/ml 
which  is  the  lower  reference  limit  of  sperm  concentration,  for  the  fifth  centiles  (with  95th  percent 
confidence  intervals),  generated  from  men  whose  partners  had  time  to  pregnancy  ≤  12  months, 
according to WHO (2010). Based on this global it cannot be excluded that bosentan has a proper effect on 
spermatogenesis in human. 
In  summary,  three  new  risks  are  added  in  the  RMP,  based  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  safety  data  as 
follows  :  testicular  disorders  and  male  infertility  (important  potential  risk),  decrease  of  sperm  count 
(important identified risk) and respiratory tract infection in children (important potential risk) and the 
SmPC section 4.8 is amended to reflect additional ADR from the updated safety data set.  
The MAH should continue to submit the following safety data,

2.7.2.  The PSUR cycle 
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.8.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  6  could  be  acceptable  if  the  applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report.  
The following amendments were requested: 
- 
Testicular disorders and male infertility should be considered as an important potential risk, the 
RMP should clearly mention the effect observed in non-clinical studies (i.e. decreased absolute 
weights of testes and epididymis, increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy) with bosentan 
itself. 
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 93/104 
 
  
  
-  Decrease of sperm count should be considered as an important identified risk in accordance with 
the data from study AC-052-402. 
-  Respiratory tract infection in children should be considered as an important potential risk. 
- 
The public summary should be updated with rapporteur’s comment on issue n°7 and issue n°8. It 
should also be updated to include the requested additional important potential/identified risks. 
An updated RMP version 7 dated 10 November 2014 was received as a result of the list of outstanding 
issues and the meeting with the MAH taken on 7 November 2014. 
The revised RMP contained the following elements:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
PAH  and  PPHN  are  to  be  considered  separately  as  their  clinical  features,  etiology  and  outcome  are 
different. 
PAH  in children : 
In PAH children less than 12 years, efficacy was assessed exclusively based on exploratory endpoints in 
2  open  label  and  not  controlled  studies  which  present  several  limitations  with  regards  to  the  efficacy 
endpoints which were exploratory and their appropriateness to properly assess bosentan effect. Data in 
children less than 2 years are limited (21 children with PK data only for 4 patients). 
FUTURE-1/2,  FUTURE-3  did  not  show  any  additional  clinical  benefit  when  using  a  dose  higher  than  2 
mg/kg  b.i.d.  (i.e.:  2    mg/kg  t.i.d.)  over  the  24  weeks  period,  which  is  consistent  with  the  systemic 
exposure remaining similar in both b.i.d. and t.i.d. groups, and also in the 4mg/kg b.i.d. group.  
The clinical studies FUTURE-1/2, FUTURE-3 with the 32 mg dispersible tablets are not robust to support 
the inclusion of children 3 months and older in section 4.1 of the SmPC. Several limitations have been 
identified with the studies (i.e. open label, important proportion of patients with combined associated 
treatment, doubt on lack of sensitivity).  
Therefore,  the  definite  benefit/risk  to  support  full  indication  in  children  remains  not  fully 
demonstrated,with uncertainties which prevent from mentioning any specific age group in the indication. 
However the CHMP agreed to amend the posology section (section 4.2 of the SmPC) to reflect available 
paediatric data. 
The submitted data confirm that higher systemic exposure could not be reached with higher dosing than 
2 mg/kg b.i.d. per day. The key study results of the studies have been included in SmPC sections 5.1 and 
5.2. 
Due to the major objection on efficacy raised, the claim for indication in children from 3 months to 18 
years section 4.1. of the SmPC has been withdrawn by the MAH.  
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 
Treatment with iNO is the mainstay for PPHN with proven efficacy. In the majority of infants, an acute 
improvement in oxygenation can be expected within 30 to 60 min of initiation of iNO at a dose of around 
20 ppm regardless of the severity of the illness. Inhaled NO is recommended as the first line treatement 
of PPHN. In some cases, infants may not exhibit improved oxygenation or a satisfactory and sustained 
response to iNO.  
Assessment report  
EMA/168487/2015 
Page 101/104 
 
  
  
 
Future  4  study  was  well  conducted  with  a  well  appropriate  design  as  add-on  therapy  to  the  iNO,  the 
mainstay treatment of PPHN. However the sample size of 13 patients creates limitation in the overall 
efficacy assessment. 
Overall, there was no benefit in adding bosentan on top of inhaled NO in infants who did not adequately 
respond to inhaled NO. The mean time to complete weaning from iNO and from mechanical ventilation 
appeared longer in the bosentan group as compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, the use of 
bosentan cannot be recommended in PPHN.  
Uncertainty about benefits 
FUTURE 1/2 were single arm studies. Bosentan was used in combination with prostanoids in 33% of 
patients. The Future 3 study is the first and sole clinical study including PAH children less than 2 years old 
(excluding PPHN). It included 21 children less than 2 years treated with bosentan.  
This study has several limitations with respect to assessment of efficacy as discussed below. First, this 
study was open label. It could have been conducted in a double blinded, double dummy design to provide 
more “robustness” of the subjective parameter WHO functional class and GCIS. 
Relevant indicators such as whether children are thriving, the need for supplemental feeds and the 
records of school nursery attendance assessment would have contributed to a more accurate evaluation 
of efficacy criteria. However, at the time of protocol finalization (30 August 2010) or FPFV (8 March 2011) 
this (Panama) classification comprising these indicators was not published.  
No conclusion could be drawn from hemodynamics, known to have robustness in PAH, due to the limited 
sample size of 10 patients.  
No conclusion could be drawn from the echocardiography/doppler due to high variability in data collected 
between the centers. 
In Future 3  eligible patients were to be clinically stable. Around 55% of the patients included received 
PAH-specific  medications  before  starting  the  study  (i.e.  PDE-5  inhibitors  and/or  prostanoids)  and 
continued their treatment in combination to bosentan study treatment. As such, it is difficult to evaluate 
what  was  the  proper  effect  of  bosentan  in  those  patients.  The  large  part  of  associated  PAH-specific 
medications  in  this  study  introduces  a  confounding  factor  in  the  assessment  of  the  proper  effect  of 
bosentan in children.  
The same uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect of bosentan is raised when looking at 
bosentan-naïve patients as compared to non-naïve bosentan patients at baseline (i.e.: 82.6% (38/46) 
and 83.3% (15/18), respectively) with a slightly lower rate of improvement in the bosentan naïve group 
(improved : 21.9 % (7/46) and 23.1% (3/18) respectively. It is not surprising that stable bosentan non 
naïve patients, while maintain on their bosentan treatment, were mainly unchanged after the start of the 
study. But the introduction of bosentan in naïve bosentan patients should have result in a higher rate of 
improvement as compared to the non-naïve patients. Conversely, the rate of improvement was lower in 
bosentan-naïve patients as compared to those previously stable with bosentan (alone or combined) 
suggesting no clinically significant effect relating to the introduction of bosentan, except if patients were 
asymptomatic and then did not require to be treated with bosentan. If this is the case, the study lacks of 
sensitivity to assess the effect of bosentan.  
WHO functional status was measured using the Dana Point pulmonary hypertension specific classification 
(based on NYHA classification) for adults. The adult classification would be appropriate for children aged 
16 years onwards.  It is not appropriate in younger children because physical growth and maturation 
achieved, influenced the way in which the functional effects of a disease are expressed. Indeed, in 
February 2011, a consensus on how to define a functional classification in children with pulmonary 
hypertension was reached by the Paediatric Task Force during the Annual Meeting of the Pulmonary 
Vascular Research Institute (PVRI). In younger children objective indicators such as thriving, need for 
supplemental feeds and the record of school or nursery attendance would be necessary.  
It is also noted that data from a well conducted clinical study that, in line with the current standard of 
care, comparing sildenafil+bosentan versus bosentan alone and eventually versus sildenafil alone would 
be beneficial and are still lacking.

Risk 
The safety data provided by the MAH in support of this application consist of an integrated safety analysis 
for the 100 paediatric PAH patients, aged 3 months to 12 years: - FUTURE-1/2 (12 weeks, 36 patients), 
FUTURE 3/Extension (72 weeks, 64 patients) and post marketing data. 
Additionally, safety data in neonates from the placebo-controlled FUTURE 4 study conducted in patients 
with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (13 patients treated with bosentan). 
In neonates (Future 4), bosentan appeared well tolerated, however the safety data are not sufficient to 
conclude given the limited number of PPHN patients and the short-term duration (median exposure 4.5 
days ranging from 0.5 to 10 days). The safety was consistent with the known safety profile of bosentan in 
older patients. 
In PAH children, the pooled pediatric safety analysis set from FUTURE-1/2 and FUTURE 3/Extension in 100 
PAH patients showed similar AEs in nature to that generally seen in adults. However, a higher rate of AEs 
associated with the infections and infestations system organ class, with upper respiratory tract infections 
being the most frequently reported, compared to adults was observed (adult around 41.3% reported in 
pooled clinical studies).  
This may in part be due to the longer median exposure in the pediatric set (71.8 weeks, range: 0.4–258.0 
weeks) compared to the adult set (17.4 weeks, range: 0.7–74 weeks) and the higher incidence of acute 
respiratory  infections  in  children  compared  to  adults  in  the  general  population.  This  explanation  is 
acceptable for CHMP, however given that the studies were not controlled, a specific effect of bosentan 
cannot be formally excluded.  
Regarding post marketing data, bosentan appeared to be used frequently in children (out of label). The 
reporting ratio and the distribution of event per SOC are consistent between paediatric and adult/elderly 
population. 
The safety data in children aged from 3 months to 2 years do not show specific safety concern in this 
population (Future 3). 
A slight increased incidence of testicular tubular atrophy (effect also observed with other ERAs macitentan 
and ambrisentan) was shown in a toxicity study in rats after 2 years of treatment with bosentan. A clinical 
study designed to specifically investigate the effects of bosentan treatment on testicular function in male 
PAH human patients (Study AC-052-402) showed a decreased sperm concentration (8/24 patients) of at 
least 42% from baseline after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. Two of the 8 patients showed a 
sperm  concentration  lower  than  the  reference  limit  of  sperm  concentration.  No  changes  in  sperm 
morphology, sperm motility were observed. Based on this global it cannot be excluded that bosentan has 
a proper effect on spermatogenesis in human. This information has been included in the SPC and patient 
leaflet. 
In  summary,  three  new  risks  are  added  in  the  RMP,  based  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  safety  data  as 
follows:  testicular  disorders  and  male  infertility  (important  potential  risk),  decrease  of  sperm  count 
(important identified risk) and respiratory tract infection in children (important potential risk). 
Discussion about benefit and risks 
In PAH children less than 12 years, efficacy was assessed exclusively based on exploratory endpoints in 
2  open  label  and  not  controlled  studies  which  present  several  limitations  with  regards  to  the  efficacy 
endpoints which were exploratory and their appropriateness to properly assess bosentan effect (open 
label, important proportion of patients with combined associated treatment, doubt on lack of sensitivity). 
Moreover, data in children less than 2 years are limited (21 children with PK data only for 4 patients). 
FUTURE-1 showed that in children, systemic exposure with bosentan 2 mg/kg was on average lower as 
compared to adults and was not increased with 4 mg/kg b.i.d.  Similar results were observed in FUTURE 
3 study, where the systemic exposure (also lower compared to adults) could not be increased with a more 
frequently dosing of 2 mg/kg t.i.d.

Following  the  major  objections  raised  by  CHMP  with  respect  to  the  limitations  of  the  newly  provided 
clinical studies to have a reliable conclusion on efficacy in children, the MAH has withdrawn the claim for 
changing the wording of the indication in section 4.1.  
In  conclusion,  the  available  clinical  studies  in  children  with  PAH  have  several  limitations  and  do  not 
support to extend the indication in children from 3 months and older.    
However, updated information is provided in the SmPC, to inform prescribers on the data available in 
children (especially with regards to the specificity of PK and exposure plateaus as compared to adults). 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 
Overall, this study showed that there was no benefit in adding bosentan on top of inhaled NO in infants 
who did not adequately respond to inhaled NO. The mean time to complete weaning from iNO and from 
mechanical ventilation appeared longer in the bosentan group as compared to the placebo group. 
Based on the available data, the use of bosentan cannot be recommended in PPHN. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
Type II 
a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one  
Update  of  SmPC  sections  4.2,  4.5,  4.6,  4.8,  5.1,  5.2  and  5.3  to  reflect  non-clinical  and  clinical  data 
generated  in  studies  conducted  according  to  the  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  for  bosentan 
(EMEA-000425-PIP02-10-M04). The Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
Further, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the SmPC and to update the contact 
details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet. In addition, taking into account the results 
observed  on  testis  and  spermatogenesis  and  the  new  data  in  the  paediatric  population,  an  updated 
version of the RMP (version 7) was agreed. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0090/2013 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

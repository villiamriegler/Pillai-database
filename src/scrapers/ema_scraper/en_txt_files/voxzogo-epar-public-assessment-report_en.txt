2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
Voxzogo is indicated for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and older and 
whose epiphyses are not closed.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 15/191 
 
 
 
 
The applicant applied for the treatment of patients 2 years and older due to the limited availability of 
data in those younger than 2 years. However, the product is still under development and the aim is to 
finally treat all age ranges (before epiphyseal closure) once appropriate data are available. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Achondroplasia (ACH) is a rare genetical disorder with an incidence of 1 in 25,000 births. The disease, 
although being the most common form of short stature with disproportionality, has an overall incidence 
(according to the COMP decision) in the EU of 0.42 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). This 
was equivalent to a total of around 21,000 people in the area of the 27 EU MSs and Liechtenstein, 
Norway, and Iceland (based on data from the year 2013). 
ACH is the most common form of short-limbed short stature and is characterised by rhizomelic shortening 
of the extremities, characteristic facies with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia, increased lumbar 
lordosis,  limitation  of  elbow  extension,  and  trident  hand.  The  vast  majority  of  individuals  with 
achondroplasia  are  diagnosed  in  early  infancy  or  at  birth,  although  prenatal  recognition  has  become 
more frequent. 
The disorder is caused by gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 
which is a negative regulator of longitudinal bone growth. All instances of achondroplasia arise from 
mutations that are autosomal dominant. These mutations are fully penetrant and show only modest 
variability of expression. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ACH is based on mutations in the FGFR3 gene, and of these virtually almost all mutations in FGFR3 
arise in the same nucleotide pair and result in the same glycine to arginine substitution (G380R) in the 
FGFR3 protein. 
Under “normal” conditions the typical FGFR3 is silent. However, various ligands, binding to the FGFR3 
results in dimerisation of the receptors, transphosphorylation and trans-activation of tyrosine kinases, 
and propagation of an intracellular signal with an overall negative downstream signal within the growth 
plate of cartilaginous bones. That is, overall FGFR3 is a negative regulator of chondrocytic bone growth 
through shortening of the proliferative phase and accelerating terminal differentiation. Consequently, 
the mentioned mutations are gain-of-function mutations. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Dysmorphic short stature is the obvious main feature of the disease. Although length at birth may be 
normal, slow growth is evident shortly thereafter. Moderate to marked short stature is present in all 
affected individuals. In adult males, average height is about 130 cm with a range from around 120 to 
145 cm. Similarly, in females, average height is 125 cm with a range of 115 to 137 cm. 
The disease causes or is associated with obvious orthopaedic complications with about 50% of the 
patients suffering from kyphosis and scoliosis, a potential for osteoarthritis and osteopenia. 
Development of craniocervical stenosis is also common. Based on the skeletal abnormalities, there is a 
high occurrence of neurological complications and symptoms with chronic back pain affecting up to 
70% of the patients, and spinal stenosis (increasing with age) and its sequelae. Patients regularly 
suffer from obesity, including abdominal obesity. Based on the craniofacial bone abnormalities, 
patients also suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea, and middle ear dysfunction. Strabismus and voice 
abnormalities are also common. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 16/191 
 
 
 
Children with achondroplasia do not suffer from impairment of cognitive function (although they 
possess an increased risk for hydrocephalus and its potential consequences). The children are not only 
uniformly motor delayed but display unusual patterns of motor development. 
Patients with achondroplasia suffer from impaired health-related quality of life, with decreased physical 
and mental health scores. Patients with achondroplasia have regularly lower levels of education and 
work participation.  
According to a recently published meta-analytic review of natural history data published between 1970 
and 2017 (Fredwal; Clinical Genetics. 2020;97:179–197), the disease includes increased mortality in 
adult patients (some studies even stating increased mortality in childhood) with an estimated mean 
disadvantage in life expectancy by 10 years, with the main causes of death being heart disease, 
neurological complications, and accidents. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current treatments for ACH are mainly limited to surgical interventions, including cervicomedullary 
decompression for foramen magnum stenosis and laminectomy surgery for spinal canal stenosis, and 
medical devices such as thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis. Furthermore, while 
supportive care options are available to assist with activities of daily living via the use of adaptive 
devices, many young patients choose to undergo invasive limb-lengthening procedures with prolonged 
recovery as an attempt to ameliorate disproportionate short stature. While as much as 15 to 30 cm 
gain in standing height can be achieved, limb lengthening remains a controversial, long and arduous 
process. It is performed rarely in the US and with varied frequency in the EU. Growth hormone (GH) 
has been used in several different studies in subjects with ACH toimprove their height. While there is 
some evidence that growth can be accelerated in the short-term (12-24 months) with GH, the long-
term treatment benefit is minimal. GH is not approved in the EU for treating ACH and is rarely used by 
pediatric endocrinologists for this condition. 
The applicant therefore states a clear unmet medical need for the condition. 
About the product 
BMN111 (vosoritide) is a modified recombinant human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The idea to 
use CNP – which activates natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-B) – was based on the observation 
of inhibitory effects on the downstream signalling of FGFR-3 activation. CNP is thought to counteract 
the growth suppressive effects of FGFR-3. This hypothesis has been based on naturally occurring 
mutations of increased NPR-B signalling, leading to increased growth throughout the growth period, 
without relevant health effects and has been confirmed in respective animal models. 
The substance down-regulates Fgfr3 signalling and consequently promotes endochondral bone 
formation, such that with sufficient duration of treatment, has the potential to improve the phenotype 
of individuals with ACH. Vosoritide was designed to be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 
degradation resulting in an extended half-life (t1/2) relative to endogenous CNP that increases 
exposure to the target growth plate and allows for once daily subcutaneous (SC) administration to 
produce its desired pharmacologic effect. 
The pathophysiology and proposed mechanism of action of the compound is shown in the following 
figure:

Figure 1: Fgfr3 and CNP/Vosoritide Signalling Pathways in Chondrocytes 
(A) Activated Fgfr3 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation (red arrows) and differentiation and disturbs matrix synthesis. 
(B) Vosoritide is a 39 amino acid CNP pharmacological analogue that inhibits Fgfr3 downstream signalling at the 
level of Raf 1 in the growth plate and induces chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (green arrows). 
The applicant has based the rationale for the development of vosoritide as a treatment option for 
children with ACH around promoting endochondral bone formation. Vosoritide therapy aims to restore 
endochondral bone formation, resulting in sustained improvements in annualised growth velocity 
(AGV). The applicant furthermore claims that height, in and of itself, is a factor of health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). The severity of the height deficit in ACH associated with medical complications 
and morbidities can have a substantial negative impact on day-to-day functioning, HRQoL, and 
longevity starting from a very early age in the ACH population relative to their average stature peers. 
Hence the treatment is proposed to bring about health improvements far beyond the increased in 
stature alone.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance vosoritide contained in the medicinal product Voxzogo is a truncated modified 
analogue of the native human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) expressed in E. coli. Recombinant 
vosoritide is a 39-amino acid peptide, comprising of 37 C-terminal residues of the native human CNP 
and two additional amino acids (Pro-Gly) on the amino terminus, as shown in Figure 2  and Figure 3.  
Figure 2:  Chemical structure of vosoritide 
Figure 3: Amino acid structure of vosoritide 
Vosoritide has a molecular weight of 4.1 kDa. Two cysteine residues (Cys23 and Cys39) form a 
disulfide bond, creating a cyclic peptide, which is essential for biological activity by binding to the 
extracellular domain of natriuretic peptide receptor-b (NPR B). Due to the reduced size conferring 
resistance to zinc metallo-protease neutral endopeptidase (NEP), vosoritide has an extended half-life 
(t1/2 10-fold greater serum half-life) relative to endogenous CNP. This increases exposure to the target 
growth plate and allows for once daily subcutaneous administration to produce its desired 
pharmacologic effect. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Vosoritide formulated bulk active substance is manufactured by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Novato, 
USA). EU GMP compliance is confirmed for all sites. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 19/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The vosoritide active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
fermentation, recovery and purification. The ranges of critical process parameters (CPPs) and the 
routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and 
endotoxin, are described for each step. No design space is claimed. The active substance 
manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
Vosoritide (BMN 111) is manufactured by expression of TAF-BMN 111 fusion protein in recombinant E. 
coli cells. The vosoritide upstream process starts with the thawing of one vial of the MCB or the WCB. 
Cell expansion is performed in a seed fermenter and cell production proceeds in a production 
fermenter. Cells are harvested and inclusion bodies (IBs) are recovered by homogenisation and 
subsequent centrifugation. The downstream process starts with the chemical cleavage of TAF-BMN 111 
followed by clarification by centrifugation and filtration to yield the BMN 111 peptide. The clarified 
filtrate is purified by chromatography and filtration steps, followed by buffer exchange. The eluate is 
formulated using a formulation buffer concentrate, followed by pH and concentration adjustment to 
obtain the target BMN 111 concentration. The resulting formulated bulk active substance is filtered and 
aliquoted into bags for storage. The storage bags are sterilised and supplied to BioMarin ready for use. 
Sufficient detail is provided on the container closure system for storage of the active substance. 
Appropriate extractable and leachable studies have been performed.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. Information on quantitative compositions of media used for cell bank 
generation, seed operations and production fermentation, as well as the compositions of buffers used 
during downstream purification and formulation are provided. 
The generation of the cell substrate is well described. Sufficient information on the host cell line E. coli 
has been provided and the expression plasmid has been adequately described. The amino acid 
sequence of TAF-BMN 111 have been provided. The DNA sequence as well as a schematic of the final 
expression plasmid are presented. 
A two-tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of 
MCB and WCB and release of future WCBs. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and 
beyond the LCA. A dual storage system for the MCB and WCB is in place. A comprehensive protocol for 
the establishment of future WCBs has been provided following the same approach as used for the 
implementation of the current WCB.  
The characterisation testing programme of MCB and WCB is considered adequate to identify relevant 
phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Cell banks will be tested periodically to confirm viability and 
compare it to historical trends. This is considered adequate. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been 
provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. 
Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 20/191 
 
 
 
The information on control of critical steps and intermediates comprises CPPs and critical performance 
attributes (CPAs; in-process controls) of the vosoritide formulated bulk active substance manufacture. 
The information on CPPs and CPAs along with their acceptance criteria (PAR or action limits, 
respectively) are in line with information provided in section 3.2.S.2.2. A comprehensive summary of 
critical quality attributes (CQAs) as defined for vosoritide formulated bulk active substance is also 
included in section 3.2.S.2.4 Control of critical steps and intermediates.  
It is noted that control of product-related substances/impurities during vosoritide manufacture is 
limited to a chromatography step, the main reduction step of products variants as demonstrated by 
process validation. This approach is considered acceptable. 
Microbial testing (bioburden and endotoxin) of process materials along with appropriate acceptance 
criteria/action limits are indicated. The hold times and storage condition for process intermediates 
stated in section 3.2.S.2.4 are adequately supported by process validation data 
 provided in section 3.2.S.2.5. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in production 
has been shown on four full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the 
predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
According to EU guidelines, the process validation (PV) follows a three-stage life-cycle approach from 
development through confirmation of process consistency prior to approval of the MAA to post-marketing 
process monitoring. The proposed life-cycle approach is endorsed. However, the applicant states that 
adjustments to the manufacturing process and/or control scheme may be implemented during process 
verification (stage three) following completion of appropriate validation testing and/or justification. The 
applicant  commits  to  introduce  any  changes  in  the  manufacturing  process  and/or  controls  via  an 
appropriate  variation  procedure  application  and  that  any  changes  will  only  be  implemented  following 
regulatory approval. 
Consecutive  representative  PPQ  batches  were  manufactured  at  commercial  scale  by  the  intended 
commercial  2a  process  at  the  intended  manufacturing  site.  All  PPQ  runs  operated  at  the  established 
normal operating ranges (NORs); critical and key process parameters and performance attributes for the 
upstream  /downstream  process  were  found  to  be  within  the  normal  operating  and  expected  ranges. 
Select non-critical, non-key process parameters that are considered most important with respect to the 
purpose of the step were also verified to be within the specified ranges. Each lot met in-process limits 
and batch record requirements, demonstrating consistent operations. Additional process monitoring was 
performed  in  particular  with  respect  to  the  microbial  control  of  the  process  intermediates.  Some 
deviations  occurred.  Overall,  deviations  have  been  satisfactorily  handled  by  the  applicant.  Microbial 
control  of  process  intermediates  is  considered  confirmed.  In  conclusion,  the  consistency  and 
reproducibility  of  the  vosoritide  formulated  bulk  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been 
adequately confirmed, supporting the proposed control strategy. 
The process clearance capability for process-related impurities has been evaluated by monitoring these 
impurities during the manufacture of commercial scale PPQ batches after each purification step. Even 
though the number of commercial batches is limited, omission of routine testing of the aforementioned 
process-related impurities at vosortide formulated bulk active substance release is considered justified; 
acceptable log clearance capabilities could be demonstrated, and residual levels were consistently below 
limit of quantification and/or detection, as applicable, from early in the manufacturing process through 
formulated  bulk  active  substance.  Residual  levels  in  formulated  formulated  bulk  active  substance 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

consistently  met  pre-defined  acceptance  criteria  and  were  comparable  to  historical  ranges.  Overall 
clearance  of  HCPs  and  endotoxins  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated.  Of  note,  control  of  HCPs  and 
endotoxins  will  remain  as  release  tests  in  the  vosoritide  formulated  bulk  active  substance  release 
specification. As regards elemental impurities, the levels of Class 1 (Cd, Pb, As, Hg), 2A (Co, V, Ni), and 
Class 3 (Li, Sb, Cu) elements in formulated bulk active substance were all well within the permitted daily 
exposure  (PDE)  limits  for  parenteral  medicines  as  listed  in  ICH  Q3D.  Reduction  of  product-related 
variants and multimers has been demonstrated to occur at a chromatography step.  Main peak, product 
variant  results  and  multimer  levels  consistently  met  the  formulated  bulk  active  substance  release 
specification. Respective reports and a summary of the reports have been provided.  
Process  material  hold  times  and  storage  conditions  have  been  validated  based  on  evaluation  of 
commercial scale lots of each intermediate (microbial control capacity and chemical stability) and small-
scale  cumulative  hold  runs  (chemical  stability)  at  the  maximum  hold  time.  The  studies  sufficiently 
support the proposed hold times of process intermediates as stated in section 3.2.S.2.4. 
Column resin re-use cycles have been sufficiently demonstrated in small-scale studies with downscaled 
conditions representative of the commercial manufacturing scale. Confirmation of resin use life will be 
performed at commercial scale. Acceptable validation protocol has been provided. 
Validation of potential reprocessing has been conducted under scaled-down conditions and at 
commercial scale. This approach is considered acceptable.  
Shipping qualification studies demonstrated suitability of the selected shipping configuration. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical development programme 
following a traditional approach.  
Analytical comparability of materials prior and post-change has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Batches included in the comparability exercise derived from the development manufacturing processes 
and the proposed commercial process. Quality elements assessed for comparability included 
comparative analytical testing (release testing), comparative additional characterisation and forced 
degradation stress studies.  
Overall, the proposed comparability exercise is considered acceptable. 
CQAs were determined by a risk assessment of product quality attributes and their impact on safety 
and efficacy using information from clinical, nonclinical, toxicology studies and prior knowledge. CQAs 
have been categorised into (1) obligatory CQAs, (2) CQAs related to process-related impurities and 
product-related substances and impurities, and (3) raw material CQAs. Product-related substances, 
product-related impurities and process-related impurities were categorised based on potential impact 
on bioactivity/efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity. Overall, the selection of CQAs is considered 
justified. Chromatography column resins and process filters used in the manufacture of vosortide 
formulated bulk active substance are automatically classified as critical raw materials in the applicant’s 
Quality Management system, which is endorsed.  
The process control strategy as proposed by the applicant is considered acceptable. Following 
principles of ICH Q8, the relationship between process controls and CQAs were systematically 
evaluated. A failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in combination with process and product 
knowledge (prior knowledge and experimentation) was used to identify potential failure modes and to 
link these to the manufacturing steps and parameters as well as to classify CPPs. Each process 
parameter was examined with regard to its potential effect on either process performance or the CQAs, 
then scored on its ability to affect a CQA, the ability to control that parameter in the manufacturing 
setting, and the likelihood that a deviation outside the accepted range could occur. An appropriate

control strategy for each CPP has been developed. Moreover, for each CPP, the PAR was tested 
experimentally and no impact on CQAs were observed. All CPPs together with the respective PAR are 
included in section 3.2.S.2.2 and section 3.2.S.2.4. 
The overall control strategy is based on the identification CQAs and includes the control of materials, 
in-process controls, release and stability testing. The overall control strategy has been sufficiently 
described and is considered appropriate to ensure consistent product quality of vosoritide formulated 
bulk active substance. 
Characterisation 
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-
the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure.  
Recombinant vosoritide is a truncated analogue of native C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) with 39 
amino acids and a molecular weight of 4100 Daltons. The two existing cysteine residues (Cys23 and 
Cys39) form a disulfide bond, creating a cyclic peptide, which is essential for biological activity.  
The majority of the characterisation studies have been performed using active substance manufactured 
with the proposed manufacturing process representative for the commercial manufacturing process. 
The primary structure of vosoritide was evaluated by appropriate analytical methods. The expected 
molecular weight and primary structure with complete coverage were confirmed. The correct 
intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues of vosoritide was confirmed. The 
secondary structure investigation revealed a characteristic signature of a random coil, α helical or β 
sheet structure elements were not present. Higher order structure is not considered relevant due to 
the simple structure of vosoritide. The absence of secondary and tertiary structure is further supported 
by literature data for the closely related natriuretic peptide. The purity of vosoritide active substance 
commercial batches was determined by appropriate analytical methods. Extensive analyses were used 
to characterise numerous product related impurities of vosoritide active substance. To understand the 
potential degradation pathways for vosoritide stress studies employing different stress conditions and a 
panel of analytical methods including release tests have been performed. Vosoritide is predominantly 
degraded by known pathways. The biological activity was determined by a cell-based assay. Activity of 
product related substances was measured. Most related substances had reduced or only residual 
activities. Thus, the intact vosoritide and the trisulfide form (converted into the disulfide form in vivo) 
represent the biologically active peptide fraction. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis 
The active substance specification of vosoritide includes tests for identity (peptide map, tryptic digest, 
RP-HPLC), appearance (visual), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), bioburden (Ph. Eur.), purity-multimer 
content (SEC), purity-deamidation (SCX), purity-related substances (RP-HPLC), purity-host cell protein 
(ELISA), potency-active fraction (RP-HPLC), peptide concentration (UV), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. 
Eur.), polysorbate 80 (RP-HPLC-CAD). 
The active substance specification for release and shelf life covers the relevant quality attributes of 
vosoritide and the acceptance criteria are considered to be acceptable.  The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance 
with ICH guidelines.  
As requested, the applicantapplicant has tightened the active substance release and shelf life 
specifications. The proposed specification limits are based on statistical analysis of batches used in the 
Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 studies and commercial active substance batches. The respective approach 
that resulted in the more stringent acceptance criterion has been used. The applicant has also 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 23/191 
 
 
 
committed to further revise the limits once at least 20 batches manufactured with the proposed 
commercial process are available (see REC1, section 2.2.7).  
The specification for general parameters like appearance, endotoxin, bioburden, pH, polysorbate, 
osmolality are considered adequate. It is also agreed that with the exception of HCPs, the specification 
contains no limits for other process-related impurities. Validation data sufficiently cover the removal of 
other process relate substances including residual DNA. The applicant commits to complete and submit 
the final study report on the Low Endotoxin Recovery (LER) study with the closing sequence (see 
REC2, section 2.2.7). 
The formulated bulk active substance contains a number of product-related substances/impurities. The 
specification for purity includes acceptance criteria for multimer content (SEC), deamidation (SCX) and 
as measured by RP-HPLC main peak (desired product), total inactive fraction, identified and 
unidentified impurities. The specification for the active fraction is acceptable. The applicant proposes to 
replace the cell-based assay that was used for potency determination during development, by defining 
an active fraction by RP-HPLC. A comprehensive analysis has been provided to demonstrate the 
correlation between potency as determined by the cell-based assay and the active fraction by RP-
HPLC. Considering the scientific rationale that vosoritide is a quite simple molecule without any 
significant secondary or tertiary structure, the proposal of the applicant to replace the cell-based 
potency assay by RP-HPLC is considered acceptable. Some analytical procedures (multimer content by 
SEC-HPLC, peptide content (strength), deamidation by SCX, polysorbate 80 by RP-HPLC-CAD, identity 
and purity by RP-U/HPLC and identity by peptide map) have been validated also for the finished 
product. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data are available for the commercial, clinical and pre-clinical manufacturing processes. 
All results meet the specification at the time of measurement. All process verification lots met the 
proposed commercial specification and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference Standard 
The manufacturer has established an appropriately characterised in-house primary and working 
reference material, prepared from lots representative of the commercial manufacturing process.  
Adequate qualification data for the reference material used to date including release as well as 
characterisation data have been submitted. An appropriate justification for the different acceptance 
criteria for certain quality attributes for qualification/requalification of the primary and working 
reference standard has been provided. A protocol for establishing reference materials is provided. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container.  
Real time, real condition stability data on commercial scale batches formulated bulk active substance 
has been evaluated at both long-term and accelerated temperature conditions according to the ICH 
guidelines. The parameters tested are the same as for release. 
All results of the stability study performed with two batches (primary stability batches on commercial 
scale) were found within the proposed acceptance criteria. Supplementary data of two development 
and four commercial active substance vosoritide batches has been provided. Structure characterisation 
and forced degradation studies also showed no differences between these batches. Therefore stability 
CHMP assessment report

results from development are considered as representative of the vosoritide formulated bulk active 
substance manufactured by commercial process. 
Photo-stability results were presented. Photostability was confirmed, associated with increased 
oxidation, ring cleavage, deamidation, and overall degradation.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Vosoritide finished product is a single-use, sterile lyophilised powder in a Type I glass vial for 
reconstitution with sterile water for injection (sWFI) prior to use. It is intended for daily administration 
by subcutaneous injection. The vosoritide lyophilised powder is white to yellow in colour and is 
preservative-free and not intended for multi-use.  
Vosoritide will be supplied in three strengths: 0.4 mg, 0.56 mg, and 1.2 mg.  
The primary packaging is 2 mL vial (glass) with rubber stopper (bromobutyl) and white flip cap and 
pre-filled syringe (glass) with plunger (bromobutyl) and tip cap with a luer lock and tamper evident 
seal containing the solvent. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EU requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product.  
Ten lyophilised vosoritide single dose vials are co-packaged with ten diluent syringes pre-filled with 
sWFI for reconstitution (1.5 mL Type 1 glass syringe with integrated luer lock and polystyrene clear 
plunger rod) and two ancillary components.  
The ancillary components comprise ten diluent needles (EasyPoint®Needle, 23 G, 1in, luer lock needle 
with safety device) and ten administration syringes (VanishPoint®Syringe, 1 mL long medical grade 
polypropylene syringe with a polypropylene plunger rod with attached 30 G 8 mm retractable needle). 
The medical devices in the co-package are considered appropriate for dilution and administration of 
vosoritide finished product. All devices are CE-marked and comply with relevant medical devices 
legislation.  
Vosoritide finished product was shown to be compatible with the commercial administration 
components. Sterilisation of the diluent needle and administration syringe is performed according to 
ISO standards. The excipients are citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, trehalose 
dihydrate D-mannitol, L-methionine and polysorbate 80.All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in 
the finished product formulation. No overage is added to vosoritide finished product. 
Satisfactory and extensive data have been provided for pharmaceutical development. A comprehensive 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was presented.  
The CQAs for vosoritide were determined based on a science and risk-based assessment of process-
related impurities, product-related impurities, raw material residuals, as well as obligatory attributes. 
Defined as CQAs are identity, appearance, colour and clarity, moisture content, reconstitution time, 
particulate analysis, uniformity of dosage units, bacterial endotoxin, sterility (bioburden), container 
closure integrity, multimer content, deamidation, related substances and impurities, active fraction, 
total peptide concentration, pH, osmolality, and polysorbate 80 content. Preformulation studies were 
performed to develop the optimal composition of vosoritide finished product. Compatibility of vosoritide 
with the formulation excipients is considered proven and supported by long-term, accelerated stability 
data and in-use stability data. The composition of commercial and clinical formulation is the same. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 25/191 
 
 
 
During development the vial size was changed from 10 mL to 2 mL vial size. Forced degradation 
studies were performed. Photostability was tested according to ICH Q1B. The main changes during 
manufacturing process development are considered appropriately documented and comprehensible. 
The container closure system consists of 2 mL (2R) Type I untreated borosilicate, clear glass vial 
closed with fluorocarbon-coated bromobutyl rubber stopper and crimped sealed with flip-off aluminium 
cap. Each vosoritide finished product strength is differentiated by the cap colour of the vial. The 
container closure system is considered appropriate for lyophilised vosoritide finished product. 
Extractable and leachable studies were performed and the respective study report is provided. Stability 
studies underline the compatibility of the container closure with vosoritide finished product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
BioMarin International Ltd. located in Ireland is responsible for EEA batch certification Valid GMP 
certificates were provided.  
A detailed narrative description of the manufacturing process was provided and a flow-chart including 
in-process controls was provided. Manufacturing consists of dilution of thawed formulated bulk active 
substance by bioburden reduction filtered buffer solution. Subsequently, bioburden reduction filtration 
of vosoritide finished product solution is performed prior to (inline) sterile filtration through two 
consecutive 0.22 µm filters and aseptic filling into 2 mL vials followed by lyophilisation. A brief 
description of the batch numbering system and a clear batch definition including potential pooling of 
different active substance batches has been provided. 
A control strategy for finished product has been implemented based on process and product 
understanding and risk management. Identified CPPs are consistent with the pre-defined CQAs in the 
development section. Acceptable ranges have been established for critical process parameters to 
adequately control the process. Further, appropriate ranges for in-process controls have been 
established. Relevant PPs and performance attributes along with their acceptance criteria/operating 
ranges and classification has been included in the process description.  
Process validation was adequately performed using representative commercial batches for process 
validation of the finished product manufacturing process adequately covering different strengths and 
batch sizes. The maximum number of vials produced is limited by the lyophiliser load and was verified 
for a range. All processing steps were appropriately verified and validation and qualification reports are 
provided. All materials used in the manufacturing process were appropriately qualified and compatible 
with vosoritide finished product.  
Relevant process holding times are provided. Process simulation media fills were appropriately 
conducted to validate aseptic processing and filling times for vosoritide finished product.  
Shipping qualification confirmed adequate shipping of vosoritide finished product in vials and sWFI in 
pre-filled syringes. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include tests for identity (Immunoblot, RP-
HPLC), appearance (visual), colour and clarity (Ph. Eur.), moisture (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time, 
particulate analysis (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.),  purity-multimer content (SEC), purity-deamidation (SCX), purity-related 
substances (RP-HPLC), potency-active fraction (RP-HPLC), peptide concentration (UV), intact vosoritide 
(RP-HPLC, UV), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), polysorbate 80 (RP-HPLC-CAD). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

The majority of methods are used to control both the active substance and finished product. The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Colour and clarity, moisture, particulate analysis, 
uniformity of dosage units, bacterial endotoxin, sterility and container closure integrity are compendial 
methods performed according to Ph. Eur. or USP monographs. The compendial method for particulate 
analysis is provided for subvisible particles. Visible particles are controlled within the visual assessment 
of appearance. Stability specifications are the same as release specifications, apart from identity, and 
polysorbate 80 content determination. As polysorbate 80 content was assessed during development 
and was found stable for the shelf-life duration it does not have to be included in the shelf-life 
specification. 
Changes in acceptance criteria for main peak and purity testing were implemented for related 
substances. Altogether, the batch analysis results confirm batch-to-batch consistency and significantly 
improved impurity profiles for commercial batches with much lower impurity levels related substances 
compared to development batches. Impurity specifications include multimer content, deamidation and 
as measured by RP-HPLC main peak (desired product), total inactive fraction, identified and 
unidentified impurities. In line with the active substance specifications, the acceptance criteria of the 
finished product specifications are currently acceptable. The applicant proposes to determine potency 
by RP-HPLC, the same method that is used for purity and thus replace the cell-based assay that has 
been used for potency determination up to now. Considering the available data, the applicant´s 
approach to remove the cell-based potency assay and use a RP-HPLC method as potency assay is 
endorsed (please refer to the active substance section). 
Justification of specification is based on the limits of the active substance, evaluation of clinical and 
commercial process batch data, and analytical variability and stability data of finished product. In line 
with the commitment for the active substance, a commitment has been provided to revise the finished 
product specification once data of at least 20 active substance batches will be available from the 
commercial process (see REC1, section 2.2.7). 
It is stated that no additional impurities are introduced in the finished product compared to active 
substance.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested by CHMP, major objection) considering all suspected and actual root causes 
in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP 
Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on 
the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis data comprise comprehensive documentation of development and commercial batches. 
Satisfactory batch analysis data have been provided for all batches comprising identity, potency, purity 
testing, strengths and composition. Additional batch analysis data has been provided for related 
substances by RP-HPLC for commercial batches.  
CHMP assessment report

The same reference materials are used for active substance and finished product. For information on 
reference materials, refer to the active substance section. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8°C including storage at 30±2°C for a single period up to 90 
days for patient convenience is acceptable. In-use stability is indicated for 3 hours at 25°C and a 
statement is included in the SmPC.  
Comprehensive data on ICH conforming stability studies have been provided. Adequate stability 
protocols (tests, methods, acceptance criteria, storage conditions, and pull schedule) are presented.  
Real time/real condition stability data of finished product  lots have been evaluated at long-term (5 ± 
3°C), accelerated (25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH and 30 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH) and stress (40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 
5% RH) temperature, in line with ICH guidelines.  
Real time data supporting the proposed shelf life were generated for finished product batches 
manufactured at the intended commercial site (lots with 0.4, 0.56, and 1.2 mg/vial). These primary 
stability batches are generally representative for commercial finished product manufacturing process 
using formulated bulk active substance manufactured with the commercial process and the commercial 
primary container closure system. Stability data are also generated for the PPQ/commercial finished 
product batches that used the formulated bulk active substance manufactured by the commercial 
process, not yet covering the proposed shelf life, but up to 18 months long-term storage. Finished 
product stability testing is performed according to the finished product shelf life specification at that 
time. Test methods employed in the stability studies are adequate and cover the stability profile of the 
product. The methods have been demonstrated to be stability indicating.  
Forced degradation and photostability studies (as per ICH Q1B) showed stability of vosoritide finished 
product under kinetic agitation and extreme light exposure with minor degradation. As a precaution, 
seen as vosoritide active substance is sensitive to photolytic degradation, a warning to protect from 
light is added in the SmPC. 
Stability upon reconstitution was assessed in the development section using representative commercial 
batches. A stability commitment stating annual testing and monitoring for at least one commercial lot 
for each dosage strength is given. Stability for ongoing commercial lots will continue to be monitored 
through 48 months with updated stability specifications. 
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product – Diluent, sWFI 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The diluent syringe consists of a siliconised glass barrel, a siliconised stopper, and a closure system 
composed of a tip cap with a luer lock and a tamper-evident seal. The glass syringes are pre-filled with 
sterile water for injection. The diluent is available with three different filling volumes of 0.5 mL, 0.6 
mL, and 0.7 mL. The label is colour coded to match with vosoritide finished product vial colours. 
A platform and bracketing approach to prior manufacturing experience of other sWFI pre-filled syringes 
(PFS) of varying sizes and fill volumes by the manufacturer was used for the development of the 
diluent, sWFI. The container closure is considered appropriate for storage and application of the diluent 
sWFI. The stopper and tip cap comply with USP and Ph. Eur. requirements for elastomeric closures.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 28/191 
 
 
 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The standard manufacturing process comprising of sWFI generation, in-line filtration and terminal 
sterilisation via steam sterilisation is described and validated. A flow-chart and brief description of the 
manufacturing process was provided, and in-process controls are depicted. IPCs and CPPs have been 
appropriately defined and included in the process description. Validation data is provided to cover the 
full range of diluent fill volumes needed for vosoritide commercial product.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis  
The release and stability specifications for sWFI were set in accordance to Ph. Eur. monograph for 
sterilised water for injection. For other compendial tests method validation reports are provided. Batch 
analyses were performed. Batches of BioMarin’s sWFI pre-filled syringes covering each configuration 
were analysed and met the requirements.  
Stability  
A shelf-life of 60 months for the sWFI PFS when stored at 2°C to 32°C is proposed. Stability data is 
provided and confirms stability for 60 months. Since the shelf-life of vosoritide finished product is 
proposed for 24 months, the co-packaged product will be assigned the shortest expiry of all 
components.  
Adventitious agents 
A comprehensive strategy has been employed to avoid, reduce or eliminate microbial and viral 
contamination in the vosoritide active substance manufacturing process. The strategy, in compliance 
with the ICH guidelines Q5A and Q5B pertaining to characterisation tests, ensures that the starting 
materials and process materials are free of microbial and bacteriophage contamination. The risk of 
introduction of contaminating microorganisms and bacteriophage into the manufacturing process is 
minimised by the use of a well characterised production cell substrate, the careful selection of raw 
materials and the use of a closed manufacturing system wherever possible. 
Validation and evaluation of viral clearance capability of the manufacturing process is not applicable, 
since vosoritide is produced by a microbial fermentation process in E. coli cells. Adequate information 
has been provided concerning the TSE risk assessment. 
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) is included for transfer of vosoritide analytical 
methods for release and stability testing of active substance and finished product. The PACMP is 
considered acceptable.  
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Active Substance 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

Overall, sufficient detail has been provided with regard to the active substance manufacturing process, 
process description and process controls. Thus, the active substance manufacturing process is 
considered adequately described. Process verification is satisfactory; the consistency and 
reproducibility of the vosoritide formulated bulk active substance manufacturing process has been 
adequately confirmed, supporting the proposed control strategy. 
The peptide has been characterised in detail using state of the art methods. Due to the manufacturing 
process, the DS contains an unusually high number of product-related substances and impurities, 
which is quite unusual for such a relatively small molecule. As requested, the active substance 
specification has been considerably tightened. To determine potency the cell-based assay has been 
replaced by RP-HPLC for future batches. At this stage, based on the limited data provided, the 
specification is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, considering the relatively wide acceptance criteria 
for some parameters, further evaluation of the specification is requested once more batch data are 
available (see REC1, section 2.2.7). A PACMP was approved for transfer of vosoritide analytical 
methods for release and stability testing of active substance. The applicant also commits to complete 
and submit the final study report on the Low Endotoxin Recovery (LER) study with the closing 
sequence (see REC2, section 2.2.7).  
Finished Product 
Adequate quality of vosoritide finished product has been confirmed. Pharmaceutical development of the 
lyophilised finished product is described in detail. The aseptic manufacturing process and lyophilisation 
is appropriately documented and the control strategy adequately justified. Satisfactory validation data 
covering all strengths and batch sizes are provided. The finished product release and shelf life 
specifications are considered appropriate. As for the active substance specification, the finished product 
specification will be revised after at least 20 active substance batches are available. The major 
objection raised in relation to the lack of nitrosamine impurities risk assessment has been satisfactorily 
resolved. A PACMP was approved for transfer of vosoritide analytical methods for release and stability 
testing of finished product. 
The container closure system is considered appropriate and compatible with vosoritide finished 
product. The proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8°C including storage at 30±2°C for a single period 
up to 90 days for patient convenience can be accepted. In-use stability is indicated for 3 hours upon 
reconstitution.  
The platform and bracketing approach applied for the development and manufacturing of the diluent 
sterile water for injection (sWFI) provided in pre-filled syringes is considered appropriately documented 
and validated. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

1.  The applicant is recommended to review the acceptance limits for active substance and 
finished product release and stability specifications once at least 20 active substance batches 
produced by the commercial process are available. (REC1) 
2.  The applicant commits to complete and submit the final study report on the Low Endotoxin 
Recovery (LER) study with the closing sequence. (REC2) 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This is a full application for a new substance. All non-clinical aspects (PD, PK and toxicology) were 
covered with own studies by the applicant. Since vosoritide is a peptide, related to endogenous C-Type 
Natriuretic Peptide (CNP), the PK and genotoxicity programme were adapted accordingly. 
Carcinogenicity studies of vosoritide have not been conducted. A carcinogenicity risk assessment for 
vosoritide was conducted, based on the known physiological properties of CNP and on the results of the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies and in consideration of the ICH S1A guideline. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Vosoritide, also known as BMN111, is a stable analogue of the endogenous peptide CNP (C-type 
Natriuretic Peptide). CNP is a member of the NP family, together with ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide) 
and BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide). It was recognised that CNP acts as a paracrine factor involved in 
endochondral bone formation. It also exerts actions in the cardiovascular system, brain and 
reproductive system. 
Three receptors exist for the natriuretic peptides which are called NPR-A, -B and -C. The latter is 
thought to be a scavenger receptor. CNP mainly binds to NPR-B and -C whereas ANP has a high affinity 
to NPR-A. The primary action of NPR-A and -B is induction of formation of the second messenger 
molecule cyclic GMP (cGMP) by guanylyl cyclases. 
Achondroplasia is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR3. 
CNP is regarded as a functional antagonist of this receptor in chondrocytes. The signalling pathways 
involved in this interaction are shown in Figure 4.

fibroblast growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NPR, natriuretic peptide receptor. 
Based on the knowledge from the literature on CNP physiology, the applicant conducted a number of 
primary PD studies in vitro and in vivo to further elucidate the pharmacological properties of the CNP 
analogue vosoritide in respect to its action on chondrocytes and bone growth. Cell culture and animal 
models of disease, carrying a mutated FGFR3 gene, were also used. 
Primary PD in vitro 
Design and key results of the conducted in vitro or ex vivo studies to characterise primary PD are

Study BNM111-11-004: Vosoritide Induced cGMP Production in FGFR3G380R and wild type

Vosoritide was able to stimulate intracellular cGMP in normal chondrocytes as well as in chondrocytes 
carrying the Ach mutation of FGFR3 G380R (Figure 5)Primary human chondrocytes were used, from 
normal and from Ach donors.

Study RS19-001: Evaluation of Dosing Frequency on Suppression of FGF2 Signalling and 
Restoration of Proliferation and Matrix Deposition by BMN111 
In this study, the effect of vosoritide on MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) activation, proliferation and production 
of extracellular matrix material was tested in the RCS rat chondrosarcoma cell line. Vosoritide was able 
to attenuate FGF2-induced MAPK activation (measured as phosphorylation by Western blotting). 
Proliferation of RCS cells was determined by counting the cells after cultivation for 72 hours (3 days) in 
the presence or absence of the test compounds. Vosoritide was present either continuously over the 72 
hours or was added for 60 min each once or twice daily (labelled as pulse in Figure 6)  
For each vosoritide treatment scheme (continuous, one pulse per day or two pulses per day) separate 
treatment controls (medium alone or FGF2 only) were defined since the procedures (e.g. frequency of 
medium change) were different. For this reason, three bars are shown in the figure also for untreated 
and FGF2-only treated cells. 
It was observed that FGF2 decreased the proliferation rate of the RCS cells. Vosoritide also reduced 
proliferation, albeit to a lesser extent. When vosoritide was added to FGF2, the proliferation rate 
increased; i.e. vosoritide partly antagonised the FGF2 effect as desired. No principal differences 
between the different stimulation schemes of vosoritide were observed. 
Figure 6:  BMN111 partly rescues FGF2 suppression of RCS cell proliferation 
The above results show that vosoritide alone does not induce cell proliferation, at least in the RCS cells 
used here. Vosoritide exerts its proliferative effect only in the presence of FGF signalling by 
counteracting the anti-proliferative effect of the latter.

Deposition of extracellular matrix material was determined quantitatively by alcian blue staining. 
Similar to the effects on proliferation, FGF2 suppressed matrix production and vosoritide largely 
counteracted this suppression.

Study BMN111-10-046: Evaluation of Endochondral Bone Growth in FGFR3Y367C (TD) Mice 
Following Multiple Subcutaneous Administrations of BMN111 
The objective of this non-GLP study was to evaluate the effects of once-daily subcutaneous 
administrations of vosoritide on overall development including skeletal growth when administered for 
10 days to 7-day-old TD mice. TD mice carry the heterozygous Y367C mutation in the FGFR3 gene, 
corresponding to the mutation leading to thanatophoric dysplasia in humans. 
Seven-day-old TD mice and their WT littermates were administered vehicle or vosoritide at 240 or 800 
μg/kg via subcutaneous injection once daily for 10 days. The duration of the study was 10 days due to 
the shortened lifespan of the TD mice and to eliminate the need for tooth trimming past 17 days of 
age. 
Clinical signs and mortality were also recorded daily during the study. Body weights were reported 
twice weekly. 
No unscheduled deaths occurred. No obvious changes in body weight were observed in the vosoritide 
treated TD mice in comparison to vehicle TD mice. 
One female, administered vosoritide at 800 μg/kg, was observed to have a mild reduction in hind limb 
motility and contraction, in addition to paw swelling and/or mild curvature of the paw (motility and 
contraction normal). 
In general, most mice at the 800 μg/kg dose level showed a transient reduced motor activity following 
drug administration for the first 5 days of treatment presumably due to vosoritide-related 
haemodynamic changes. Normal motor activity was resumed approximately 2 hours after drug 
administration. 
Vosoritide increased the length of the bones assessed and whole body length dose-dependently by 
around 3% (low dose) and around 5% (high dose, Table 4).

Data presented are absolute measures and are expressed in mm. 
Data presented are percentage of increase in comparison to vehicle-treated TD mice. 
In comparison to vehicle-treated WT mice, the histological analysis of the distal femur of the TD mice 
revealed a marked decrease in the size of the epiphyseal head, delayed secondary ossification, reduced 
size of the growth plate, lack of pre-hypertrophic zone, lack of columnar arrangement and abnormal 
shape and small size of the hypertrophic cells. Vosoritide daily subcutaneous administrations for 10 
days partially restored the mentioned defects; see figure below.

Figure 7:  Histological Evaluation of the Effects of Vosoritide on the Growth Plate of TD 
Distal Femurs after 10 Days of Treatment. 
In this mouse model of thanatophoric dysplasia, disordered arrangement of chondrocytes in the growth 
plate is observed. The applicant claimed that disordered chondrocytes also are a typical sign for 
achondroplasia in humans. Healthy animals treated with vosoritide revealed disarranged chondrocytes 
in the growth plate (see toxicology section). The applicant argues that any undesired bone changes 
observed in healthy animals after vosoritide treatment are due to more-than-normal bone growth. 
According to the applicant, undesired bone changes such as disordered chondrocytes with vosoritide 
should not occur when the bone growth is retarded by an FGFR3 mutation as in achondroplasia 
because even after vosoritide treatment the bone growth is not higher than normal. Unfortunately, the 
TD model is not helpful to confirm this assumption because in TD animals disturbed chondrocyte order 
already exists without vosoritide treatment.  
Disordered arrangement of the chondrocytes in the growth plate is not established as a classical 
feature of Ach in humans. In a recent review on achondroplasia by Ornitz and Legeai-Mallet 
(Developmental Dynamics 246:291–309, 2017) it was stated that “with age, there is progressive 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 37/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorganisation of the skeletal growth plate”, implying that at young age or during foetal development 
there is no disorganisation. The applicant has presented three publications in which histological images 
of growth plates from Ach subjects and healthy individuals are shown (Ponseti, J of Bone and Joint 
Surgery 1970, 52-A: 701-716; Rimoin et al., New Engl J Med 1970, 238: 728-735; Briner et al. 1991, 
Path Res Pract 187: 271-278). Some of the Ach subjects had nearly normal chondrocyte arrangement 
in the growth plates whereas in others the latter was markedly altered. Thus, disordered arrangement 
of chondrocytes obviously is not a common feature in Ach, although it may occur. 
Study BMN111-11-001: Evaluation of Bone Growth in FGFR3ach Mice Following Subcutaneous 
Administrations of BMN111 for 36 days 
In this study, an animal model of Ach was used, carrying the heterozygous FGFR3 mutation G380R 
which corresponds to the human Ach mutation. The mutated FGFR3 gene was introduced into the mice 
as a transgene. Its expression was largely restricted to cartilage by using Type II collagen promotor 
and enhancer sequences for driving its expression. The mice have an FVB gene background, named 
after their susceptibility to Friend leukaemia virus B. 
The Ach mice display a moderate decrease in the length of the appendicular and axial skeletons, a 
dome shape cranium, and smaller proliferative and hypertrophic zones with, nonetheless, overall intact 
architecture. Heterozygous animals had approximately 5-10 % shorter body length and ~24% shorter 
limb length when compared to the WT littermates. While Ach patients have a narrowing of the foramen 
magnum, increased foramen magnum area was observed in these mice. 
Eight Ach mice (males only) per group (Groups 2 to 5) received a daily dose of vosoritide (0 [vehicle], 
20, 80 or 280 µg/kg) for 36 days. A group (Group 1) of 10 wild-type FVB mice receiving vehicle was 
also included for comparison (Table 5).

Body weight: 
The body weights of Ach animals were significantly lower than their WT littermates at the beginning of 
the study. Treatment with vosoritide resulted in an increase in body weight in vosoritide-treated Ach 
mice when compared to vehicle-treated Ach mice. After 18 days of treatment, body weights in Ach 
animals given 280 μg/kg were not statistically different from vehicle-treated WT mice.  
Body/tail/bone length: 
At the beginning of the treatment, Ach animals were shorter (naso-anal) than wt animals. After 36 
days of treatment with vosoritide, a dose-dependent increase in mean body length compared to vehicle 
control was observed; the mean body length in the high-dose group slightly exceeded the mean length 
of the WT animals (Table 6).

The applicant pointed out that the tail shortening caused by the Ach mutation was over-corrected with 
high-dose vosoritide, i.e. mean tail length in the high-dose group was higher than in WT animals.  
Particularly in healthy animals used in the repeated-dose toxicology studies (see Section 2.3.4. ), 
functional impairment of the hind limbs and abnormal shape of the femur were observed along with tail 
kinking. The applicant assumed that the reason for the irregular bone growth leading to these signs is 
a higher-than–normal growth rate which results from vosoritide treatment in animals with a normal 
growth rate before treatment. The applicant also referred to similar observations in FGFR3 knock-out 
mice which also show faster-than-normal growth. 
The applicant further argued that in animals with FGFR3 mutations and in humans suffering from Ach 
the bone growth rate is reduced so that vosoritide treatment usually does not lead to a higher-than-
normal growth rate. Consequently, irregular bone growth should not occur. 
However, in this study tail-kinking was also observed in the low- and mid-dose group in which growth 
rate was not higher than in WT controls. Functional impairment of the hind limbs was observed in two 
Ach animals only, one of the vehicle and one of the high-dose group, so that no firm conclusions on 
the relationship between vosoritide dose, growth rate and hind limb impairment can be drawn from 
this study. 
An early sign of irregular bone growth could be the disarrangement of the chondrocyte columns in the 
growth plate as observed in healthy animals treated with vosoritide (see section on repeated-dose 
toxicology). Histology of the growth plate was not reported in this study. Furthermore, the applicant 
claimed that in Ach the chondrocyte arrangement is disturbed as such. However, as discussed above 
(Study BMN111-10-046), disturbed chondrocyte arrangement is not a consistent finding in Ach. 
Also the growth of the long bones was in line with the increase in body length; vosoritide dose-
dependently increased the length of femur, tibia and ulna; there was virtually no effect on the humerus 
(Table 8).

Regarding the skull, vosoritide dose-dependently increased the anterior-posterior length of the whole 
skull and decreased the dimensions (length and width) of the foramen magnum. In Ach animals the 
foramen magnum is larger than in WT animals; in the high-dose group the foramen became smaller 
than in WT animals. 
Growth plate histomorphometry: 
The heights of the three different zones of the femur growth plate were measured histologically. A 
clear dose-dependent increase in height was observed for the zone of multiplication, from 64.7 µm 
(vehicle) to 85.7 µm (high dose). In the other zones, zone of reserve cartilage and zone of 
hypertrophy, no or only small changes were observed. 
Organ weights: 
There was a dose-dependent increase in liver weight with vosoritide treatment, from 1.20 g (vehicle to 
1.45 g (high-dose). No major changes were observed for other organs. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In search for off-target effects of vosoritide, the applicant conducted an in vitro screen of a panel 
potential (off-)target structures (Study BMN111-11-026). Eight receptors were inhibited by BMN111 in 
low micromolar concentrations, most strongly the human apelin receptor (which mediates various CV 
effects). The observed IC50 values of vosoritide in that assay are by more than 3 orders of magnitude 
higher than the mean Cmax at week 52 in patients treated with 15 µg/kg vosoritide.

Study BMN111-11-040: Cardiovascular Safety Pharmacology Evaluation of BMN111 
Administered by Rapid Subcutaneous Infusion to Male Telemetry Instrumented Conscious 
Nonhuman Primates 
The purpose of this GLP study was to evaluate the potential CV effects of vosoritide in telemeterised 
male cynomolgus monkeys. Vosoritide was administered by rapid remote subcutaneous infusion to 
animals in a double Latin square dosing design (Phase I) and a 7-day repeat dose study design (Phase 
II).  
In Phase I, eight male cynomolgus monkeys were 3.6 to 6 years of age at study initiation with body 
weights of 4.0 to 5.8 kg. Animals were telemeterised and permanently implanted with in-dwelling 
catheters in the abdominal aorta. Prior to dosing, catheters were introduced to the subcutaneous tissue 
in the lumbar region and sutured in place. An external pump was used to administer the test article. 
The dosing regimen for Phase I is presented in Table 10.

In Phase II, all animals were transferred from Phase I and given vosoritide at 200 µg/kg daily for 7 
days at a dose volume of 1 mL/kg. 
After a single vosoritide dose (Phase I), a dose-dependent transient increases in HR and decrease in 
blood pressure were noted, see figure below. Maximal effects were reached within 15 to 30 minutes of 
dosing for animals given 200 μg/kg, and within 1.75 or 2 hours for animals given 50 or 10 μg/kg, 
respectively. At the nadir, BP decrease was 6.8% and 12.2% in animals given 50 and 200 μg/kg 
respectively. Maximum HR increase was ~ 37% and ~ 49 % in animals given 50 and 200 μg/kg, 
respectively. 
Figure 8: Mean Heart Rate and Mean Arterial Pressure in Phase I Animals 
All ECG parameters evaluated were considered qualitatively normal. Some intervals were shortened 
(e.g. PR, QT, and QTcB) but the QRS duration was not affected.  
In Phase II, i.e. with repeated dosing, vosoritide-related clinical observations were limited to 
idiosyncratic short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recumbency in 3/8 animals during the first 
hour post-dose in the repeat-dose portion of the study. This may be likely related to the 
haemodynamic effects of vosoritide, but it is unclear why the clinical observations of recumbency were 
only seen in Phase II. Vosoritide rapidly decreased arterial pressures and increased HR with similar 
timing and magnitude as seen in Phase I. Blood pressure effects on subsequent days were generally 
smaller in magnitude and appeared later. No apparent accommodation was seen for HR.

Absorption 
Vosoritide is a peptide intended for SC injection. Therefore, no studies for determining the mechanism 
of absorption were performed. 
The most salient finding of absorption and TK studies was a strong increase of Cmax and AUC with 
dose which was markedly higher than proportional. An example (from rat toxicology study BMN111-
11-052) is shown in Table 12. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was not determined; 
however, there is a scavenger receptor (NPR-C) for CNP which also binds vosoritide. Saturation of this 
receptor with increasing vosoritide doses could retard elimination and thereby increase plasma levels 
and exposure.

Study BMN111-17-027: Characterisation of the Biodistribution of 124I-BMN111 using PET 
Imaging in Sprague Dawley Rats 
Tissue distribution of vosoritide was determined in rats (Sprague Dawley) by PET imaging using 
vosoritide labelled with iodine-124 after a single SC injection of 90 µg/kg or a single IV injection of 50 
µg/kg. 
Following imaging, animals were euthanised and multiple tissue samples were collected for ex vivo 
analysis. Ex vivo gamma counts were obtained of the injection site, brain, lung, liver, stomach, 
intestines, kidneys, spleen, muscle, testicles, femur, tibia and for some animals also of the heart. 
The results of the dynamic PET scan after IV injection are shown in Figure 9. Shortly after dosing, most 
activity is found in liver and kidney which declines over time. Simultaneously, activity in the stomach 
and in the bladder markedly increased. No change over time was observed in the brain. Static PET 
revealed a decline of activity in the stomach and testes from 4 hours after IV injection onwards. At 24 
hours after injection, some residual radioactivity was still present in the stomach.

Figure 9: Dynamic PET after IV injection of 124I-vosoritide (50 µg/kg): % Injected Dose Per 
Gram with Std Deviation 
After SC injection, dynamic PET mainly revealed activity at the injection site which declined over time. 
The ex-vivo investigation (Figure 10) of tissues revealed radioactivity predominantly in the stomach 
and, to a much lesser extent, at the injection site and in the intestine. Virtually no activity was 
detected in the brain.

Study BMN111-18-004: Biodistribution of 124I-BMN111 after Subcutaneous Administration to 
Rats 
Male Sprague Dawley rats received a SC administration of 124I-vosoritide at a target dose level of 90 
μg/kg, equivalent to a radioactive dose level of 500 μCi/kg. Necropsy was performed at three different 
time points after dosing, at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 hour(s) post-dose. At the time points 0.25 h and 1 h 3

animals were euthanised, and at the time point 0.5 h 2 animals; one animal was not evaluated due to 
a dosing error. Blood and tissues were analysed for radioactivity and the counts were corrected for 
radioisotope decay. The results are provided in Table 13. Most radioactivity was present at the 
injection site, followed by stomach. The lowest levels were found in the brain.

Metabolism 
Metabolism was not studied. Therefore, it is not known whether circulating biologically active 
fragments of vosoritide contribute to its effects. 
Excretion 
Excretion was not studied except for an in-vitro study with human live microsomes making excretion 
via CYP enzymes unlikely as expected for a peptide. A scavenger receptor, NPR-C, exists; furthermore, 
glomerular filtration of vosoritide is conceivable unless it is bound to plasma proteins (which is not 
known). Proteolytic degradation also will play a role in excretion. 
DDI 
In-vitro cytochrome P450 inhibition and induction studies showed that vosoritide is neither an inducer 
nor an inhibitor of CYP enzymes.

Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant conducted seven repeated-dose studies (Table 15). Part of the studies were conducted 
in animals which were juvenile at least at the start of the study. In all repeated-dose studies, 
vosoritide’s actions on bone were specially and extensively evaluated using several different methods. 
One rat study (BMN111-11-036) was conducted in rather old animals (8 to 9 months), assuming that 
bone effects are less pronounced in these slower growing animals so that other toxic effects would be 
easier to detect. 
The studies in juvenile animals are also described in the respective subsection of the section on 
reproductive toxicology. The description here focuses on bone effects and provides comparison to the 
findings in adult animals. The pivotal toxicity studies in rats and monkeys (adult and juvenile) are 
presented in more detail hereafter.

At study initiation, rats were at least 8 months of age to minimise vosoritide PD effects on bone. 
Animals were assigned to 8 groups and were either given vehicle control or BMN111 at 50, 150 or 500 
μg/kg daily for 26 weeks (183 doses total) as a single SC administration in the dorsal region. Main 
study animals were allocated to Groups 1 through 4 and toxicokinetics (TK) animals to Groups 5 
through 8. Five animals/gender/group (main study dose groups 1-4) underwent a 28-day recovery 
period after the dosing phase.

The dose volume was 1 mL/kg. 
The following observations were made: 
Mortality 
In total, there were 17 unscheduled deaths. None was considered related to vosoritide. 
Clinical observation 
Administration of BMN111 resulted in limited use of hind legs (males given >150 μg/kg and females 
given 500 μg/kg), kinking tails (males given >50 μg/kg and females given >150 μg/kg), altered 
ambulation (males and females given >150 μg/kg) and valgus at joints (males given >150 μg/kg and 
females given 500 μg/kg). Severity of kinking tail was dose-dependent, with low-dose animals 
illustrating minor waved tail appearances and high-dose animals having corkscrew-like tail 
appearances. 
Altered ambulation was observed mostly at the hind legs and was described as pigeon-toed with knees 
buckled inwards. Valgus was observed mostly at the front paws/legs and was categorised as outward 
angulations of carpal joints. 
The observations persisted to the end of the recovery phase and correlated with macroscopic bone 
observations such as abnormal shapes of stifle and carpal joints, femur, and tail (coccygeal vertebra). 
Body weight, food consumption 
No test article-related alterations were observed. 
DXA scan 
No consistent changes in BMC or BMD were observed. 
ADA 
Antidrug antibodies (ADA) were measured in plasma by a bridging electrochemiluminescent (ECL) 
immunoassay.

Two sets of 5% pooled normal serum from the species to be tested (rat here) in Assay Buffer in 
duplicate and the Protein A-purified rabbit anti-C Type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) IgG polyclonal 
antibody at three concentrations (250, 62.5, 31.3 ng/mL) were included on each plate as negative and 
positive controls, respectively. The positive control served to monitor the assay and had no clinical 
relevance. The negative control was used to establish a plate-specific cut point. The samples were 
screened at 1:20 and 1:100 in duplicate. Samples were evaluated relative to the cutpoint relative light 
units (RLU) of the plate, where the cutpoint RLU was defined as the mean RLU of the two sets of 
matrix controls plus the cutpoint constant established during validation. 
Antibody results: 
ADAs were detected in all dosage groups, the titre ranging from 20 to 2500. A clear dose-response 
relationship in ADA incidence or titre was not observed. 
Due to the study design, and the fact the toxicokinetic concentration samples were not collected in 
these animals, the impact of positive ADA on the toxicokinetics of BMN111 could not be assessed. 
The neutralising potential of ADA was not tested. Neutralising antibodies could mask effects of the test 
substance, but since exaggerated PD effects of vosoritide were observed in the toxicology studies, 
neutralising antibodies apparently are not considered as an issue. 
Laboratory findings 
A small increase in white blood cell count was observed in high-dose females. 
Several serum chemistry parameters were mildly altered in mid-and high-dose animals, including 
cholesterol and triglycerides (lowered), inorganic phosphorus (higher) and alkaline phosphatase 
(higher). The latter two could be related to test article-related alterations of bone turnover. 
The described changes were largely reversible at the end of the recovery period. 
Macroscopic findings 
Test article-related macroscopic findings related to the pharmacology of BMN111 were limited to 
bones, and were present in joint (stifle and carpal joints); tail (coccygeal vertebra); sternum; femur; 
and bone (tibia; thoracic vertebra; and spinal vertebrae, entire). These macroscopic findings generally 
correlated microscopically with increased bone growth plate thickness and/or growth plate dysplasia

Microscopic findings 
Test article-related microscopic findings were limited to expected pharmacologic targets for bone, and 
included femur; sternum; joint (stifle and/or carpal joint bones); bone (tibia; thoracic vertebra; and/or 
spinal vertebrae, entire); and tail (coccygeal vertebra). Males given >50 μg/kg and females given 
>150 μg/kg were affected. The findings included increased growth plate thickness and/or growth plate 
dysplasia (minimal to moderate severity) of bone. In the long bones (femur; tibia; and less frequently, 
radius), these changes often resulted in an abnormal angle of the distal bone that correlated to the in-
life observations of valgus deformity, swollen limbs, limited use, and altered ambulation. 
Increased growth plate thickness was characterised by increased number and disorganisation of 
chondrocytes in the growth plates of affected bones [femur, tibia, ulna, radius, vertebrae (tail, spine, 
and thoracic), and sternum]. The bones examined varied in individual animals depending on the depth 
of the section in areas sampled. In contrast to the well-organised, straight columns of chondrocytes in 
growth plates of control animals, affected growth plates were thicker with irregular contours and 
comprised of varying sized oval to circular clusters of chondrocytes, sometimes separated by a cellular 
cartilage matrix. The growth plate thickening was primarily characterised by increased layers of 
chondrocytes in the zones of multiplication, maturation, and hypertrophy. 
Growth plate dysplasia was characterised by disorganised chondrocytes forming variably sized 
irregular-shaped aggregates of cells, often below the original growth plate, in the shaft of long bones, 
forming a continuous band of cartilage across the subphyseal bone, increases in endochondral 
ossification, increased subphyseal trabecular bone, and increased numbers of retained cartilage cores 
in subphyseal trabecular bone. 
Bone growth 
Bone growth data were not reported. 
Vaginal cytology 
No test article-related alterations were noted in the oestrous cycle. 
Spermatogenesis 
Administration of BMN111 to male rats at 150 or 500 μg/kg caused a significant decrease in sperm 
count at the dosing phase euthanasia. For details see section on reproductive toxicity. 
TK 
TK parameters for Day 176 are provided in Table 17. In the high-dose group, Cmax and AUC were 
markedly higher in males than in females. This was associated with strong increase in dose-normalised 
AUC in high-dose males. The reason for this observation is unclear. At the other study days where TK 
data were obtained (Day 1 and Day 85) AUC and Cmax in general were markedly higher in males than 
in females.

Study BMN111-11-043: 44-Week Repeat-Dose Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study Following 
Daily Subcutaneous Administration of BMN111 in Cynomolgus Monkeys with a 13-Week 
Recovery 
Male and female cynomolgus monkeys of Chinese origin (Covance Research Products Inc., Alice, TX, 
USA) were 4 to 5 years old with body weights ranging from 2.6 to 5.4 kg for males and 2.8 to 4.1 kg 
for females at study initiation. Animals were randomly assigned to four groups and were dosed with 
vehicle or 25, 75, or 250 μg/kg vosoritide once daily for 44 weeks by subcutaneous injection in the 
interscapular region in four rotating sites, with a fifth naïve site used for the final dose. The following 
observations were made: 
Clinical observations 
In the 250 µg/kg group, 6 animals (5M, 1F) and in the 75 µg/kg group 1 male displayed limited use of 
hindlimbs, beginning at Day 121 (around 20 weeks) of dosing. According to the applicant, this mainly 
resulted from decreased range of motion of the hip joint. 
Body weights 
No vosoritide-related effects were observed

No vosoritide-related effects on blood pressure were observed 
Heart rate (HR) was derived from ECG readings. HR was significantly higher post-dose compared to 
controls in the high-dose (250 µg/kg) group. HR excursion peaked on Day 305 with 155 bpm in mean 
in the high-dose group (males) vs. 122 bpm (mean) in the control group (males) and 193 bpm vs. 146 
bpm in females. 
cGMP levels 
Levels of cGMP were determined in the blood plasma of the study animals by a commercial cGMP 
Enzyme Immunoassyay (EIA). The results are shown in Figure 11. In the mid-and high-dose group, a 
clear and dose-dependent cGMP increase over time is visible. 
Figure 11: Levels of cGMP 
ADA 
The method of antibody detection was the same as used in Study BMN111-11-036. 
No anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in control animals. The number of ADA-positive 
vosoritide-treated animals increased during the study, but there was no dose-dependence of ADA 
incidence. At study end, 100%, 87.5% and 78.6% of the animals were ADA positive in the 25, 75 and 
250 µ/kg group, respectively. 
The neutralising potential of the antibodies was not tested. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no relevant haematology, coagulation or clinical chemistry findings. 
Macroscopic findings 
Except for bone, there were only few macroscopic findings in individual animals which can be 
considered incidental. Dose dependent bone changes mainly were noted in the femur (e.g. raised or 
depressed area, fracture) but also in the pelvis (shallow acetabulum), tibia, patella, humerus, scapula 
and ulna (depressed area and others). Depressed area can mean cartilage erosion. 
Microscopic findings 
In case of bones and joints, the macroscopic abnormalities were further examined microscopically. 
Beside of incidental findings in individual animals, vosoritide-related changes were observed at the 
injection sites and in bones and joints; the latter included e.g. erosion of articular cartilage. Increased 
thickness of growth plate was noted in animals having received 250 µg/kg with more closely spaced 
chondrocyte columns, increased layers of chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 56/191 
 
 
 
 
At the injection sites in the subcutis, a dose-dependent increase of perivascular infiltrates and fibrosis 
was observed. 
Bone growth 
Bone growth was still evident in these older animals. Mid and high dose vosoritide increased the length 
of long bones. 
The per cent change in bone length (tibia, femur and humerus as depicted below) was up to around 15 
in mid- or high-dose animals compared to around 5% to 10% in vehicle controls. 
Figure 12: Percent change in bone length, Week 44 vs. predose 
DXA 
There were no vosoritide-related effects on BMC or BMD. 
Serum bone/cartilage markers 
The following markers were investigated:  
•  N-terminal propeptide of Type I collagen (PINP) 
•  C-telopeptide of collagen Type II (CTx II) 
•  C-telopeptide of collagen Type I (CTx I) 
•  Osteocalcin (OC) 
•  N-telopeptide (NTx) 
•  Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (NTx) 
Vosoritide-related changes were only observed for CTx II, a cartilage degradation marker. Levels were 
slightly increased compared to control during treatment in the mid- and high-dose group. Statistical 
significance was reached in high-dose females. At the end of the recovery period, CTx II levels 
remained increased in two high-dose females. 
Biomechanical strength 
Femora and L3 vertebrae were tested for mechanical stability (maximum load, stiffness, energy, 
ultimate strength [femora] or stress [vertebra], elastic modulus and toughness). No consistent and 
dose-dependent effects of vosoritide were observed.

Male reproductive assessment 
No relevant abnormalities were detected.  
TK 
The obtained TK parameters are provided in Table 18 for Week 12. Exposure was often but not always 
higher in males than in females. AUC and Cmax were generally higher in Week 12 than at Day 2. 
Variability (SD) was rather high. The increase of Cmax and AUC with dose was markedly higher than 
proportional.

Due to the unexpected lack of pharmacologic effects noted at the high dose during the first 13 weeks 
of treatment, evaluation of the animals in respect to body length and food consumption measurements 
as well as clinical observation were transiently stopped. In vivo activities started again once the first 
pharmacologic effects were noted, approximately one week later. No relevant findings were made in 
the pre-weaning period. The observations in the post-weaning period are presented hereafter. 
Mortality 
There were several unscheduled deaths (mainly animals found dead) during the study, but none was 
considered related to treatment with BMN111 by the applicant.

Clinical observations 
The clinical observations made predominantly were related to abnormal motoric functions as tabulated 
below. Motoric impairment only occurred in the high-dose group and consisted among others of 
abnormal hind paws, abnormal gait and hunched posture. Males were more frequently affected than 
females.

Body length 
Body (crown-rump) and tail length was increased in high-dose animals compared to vehicle controls,

Bone length 
High-dose vosoritide increased the length of long bones and of the lumbar spine over time compared 
to vehicle controls. Width of the bone was not relevantly affected. Figure 15shows the results for male 
animals. The findings in females were similar but slightly less pronounced in general.

Biomechanical testing 
As shown in Figure 16, there was a dose-dependent decrease in some parameters of mechanical 
stability of the femur in males, reaching statistical significance in the high-dose group (for peak load 
also in the mid-dose group). The effects in females were similar albeit slightly less pronounced.

Starting at Study Week 14/15, males and females treated with BMN111 at 90 μg/kg/day were noted 
with decreased BMC and BMD at the femur and lumbar spine, compared to controls. In the high-dose 
males, femur BMD decreased by up to 19%.

Bone radiography 
X-ray of the hind limbs revealed pathological changes in the distal tibia and proximal femur, mainly in 
high-dose animals. The changes included increased radiolucency, displacement of the physis and 
fractures (Figure 18, Table 22).

In 3 out of eight high-dose females, a small increase in neutrophil count was observed as compared to 
control. No relevant changes in coagulation parameters were observed. Serum phosphorus and 
alkaline phosphatase were slightly increased in mid- and high-dose males. The latter changes can be 
related to altered skeletal growth. 
ADA 
The method for detecting binding antibodies is described in Study BMN111-11-036; neutralising 
potential of the ADA was not determined.

ADA were observed at all three dose levels 10, 30, and 90 μg/kg. There were 0 of 12 (0%) ADA 
positive responses detected in vehicle treated rats (Group 1) on Days 188 and 230. The incidence of 
positive ADA responses on Day 188 in all three treatment groups was similar. For Group 2 (10 μg/kg), 
12 out of 18 (67%) tested positive for ADA. For Group 3 (30 μg/kg), 10 out of 18 (56%) tested 
positive for ADA. For Group 4 (90 μg/kg), 11 out of 18 (61%) tested positive for ADA. On Day 188, the 
mean and median titres increased with increase in dose level. The mean/median titres were 138/20, 
767/100, and 1368/300 for Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 
Macroscopic findings 
Macroscopic, vosoritide-related findings were limited to bones and joints and were mainly found in 
high-dose males. Findings included thickening of acetabulum, raised or depressed areas and fractures 
of the femur and raised areas on the tibia. 
Microscopic findings 
Microscopically, vosoritide-related findings in animals euthanised on PND 189 were limited to skeletal 
structures attributed to exaggerated pharmacology of vosoritide in animals treated with ≥ 30 μg/kg, 
consistent with clinical, macroscopic, and radiologic findings. The bones affected were those of the 
appendicular skeleton (posterior and anterior), axial bones, and joints. The changes primarily affected 
the growth plate and associated metaphysis. Joints and articular cartilage were also secondarily 
affected. There were few gender differences noted. The changes consisted of enlargement and/or 
persistence of the physes of numerous bones related to pharmacologic effects on chondrocyte 
proliferation, degeneration and necrosis in the femoral head and neck and acetabulum, disorganised 
cartilage and bone growth in the tibia, and articular/periarticular inflammation of the tibiotarsal joint. 
These findings were described as degenerative joint disease or degenerative osteoarthritis and were 
attributed to exaggerated growth causing mechanical dysfunction and possibly vascular impediments 
leading to loss of tissue integrity. There were no microscopic findings in soft tissue structures related to 
treatment with vosoritide. 
Behavioural Performance 
The following tests were performed: Functional observation battery, motor activity, auditory startle 
habituation and Cincinnati water maze. 
Treatment-related changes in functional observational battery and decreased motor activity were noted 
in the high-dose group. The changes in functional observation primarily affected the neuromuscular 
system domain (gait function, locomotor activity, arousal, body position, rearing and toe pinch). These 
as well as the reduced motor activity were attributable to the clinical conditions of the hind limbs/hind 
paws of these animals. In the water maze, swimming abilities were impaired, but learning was not 
affected. 
Study BMN111-11-035: 26-Week Repeat-Dose Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of 
Subcutaneous Administration of BMN111 in Cynomolgus Monkeys with a 28-Day Recovery 
Juvenile male and female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) of Chinese origin were assigned 
to four groups and administered vehicle control or test article as indicated in the following table. At 
study initiation, the animals were 2-3 years of age, weighted 2.1-2.7 kg for the males and 2.1-2.9 kg 
for the females and were growing as assessed by the presence of open growth plates during the 
conduct of the study.

All Day 141 female samples (when Lot No. CM050611-FBDS was used as reference standard for 
formulations prepared using Lot No. 2011-111-11-101711) had mean concentrations ranging between 
143.3 and 146.5%. Analytical standards prepared using Lot No. CM050611-FBDS were injected as 
samples and quantified against analytical standards prepared using Lot No. 2011-111-11-101711. 
Results showed that CM050611-FBDS standards were approximately 70% of targeted concentrations 
when Lot No. 2011-111-11-101711 was used as reference standard, explaining the high recovery at 
this interval. Additionally, all Day 176 male and female samples (when Lot No. 2011-111-11-101711 
was used as reference standard for formulations prepared using the same lot) had mean 
concentrations ranged between 66.3 to 69.8%. Re-analysed backup samples for Day 176 female 
samples showed similar results. The reanalysis and OOS investigations did not yield any definitive 
cause of the low recoveries. A possible cause for these OOS observations could be the uneven mixing 
of the test material after thawing during test material aliquot procedures. The presence of drug-related 
clinical signs during the study and the toxicokinetic analysis indicated that the animals may have 
received sufficient doses but possibly variable. 
Mortality 
All animals survived to their scheduled necropsy at the end of the dosing or recovery phase 
Clinical observations 
BMN111-related clinical signs included limited use of hips and/or decreased range of motion of hind 
legs in animals given 300 μg/kg (4M, 1F). 
Decreased range of motion appeared as early as Day 88 of the dosing phase and limited use of hips 
appeared later in the dosing phase (after 21 weeks of dosing) and persisted through the end of 
recovery phase, or appeared with a delayed occurrence during the recovery phase. The four males with 
test article-related clinical signs had higher (approximately 2- to 15-fold) Cmax levels on Day 85 when 
compared with the other three males in the same group. The one high dose female with limited use of 
hips had similar Cmax to the rest of its group. Bilateral abnormal femoral heads were observed 
macroscopically in two animals at necropsy, corresponding to the clinical sign of limited use of hips. 
Body weight, food consumption 
No BMN111-related alterations in body weight and body weight change were noted for animals given 
up to 300 μg/kg. Qualitatively low or no food consumption was noted periodically and had no impact 
on weight gain. 
Blood pressure, ECG 
No BMN111-related alterations in blood pressure were noted for animals given up to 300 μg/kg when 
evaluated 30 minutes to 1.5 hours post dose using a tail cuff on unanesthetised animals.

Incidental, statistically significant QRS duration values were noted. The magnitudes of the differences 
in QRS duration relative to the control group were minimal. The statistical findings in QRS duration 
were inconsistent between sex and across collection intervals in the males. Therefore, the alterations 
in QRS duration were considered incidental by the applicant and not attributed to BMN111. 
A dose-dependent increase in heart rate after dosing, lasting around 3 to 4 hours, was observed [table 
at p1065 of study report]. 
ADA 
The method for detecting binding antibodies is described in Study BMN111-11-036; neutralising 
potential of the ADA obviously was not determined. 
At Week 13, ADA incidence was 7/8 (88%), 2/8 (25%), and 5/14 (36%) for the low-, mid and high-
dose group, respectively. All animals with positive ADA titres on Week 13 remained positive at Week 
26. 
Laboratory findings 
There were few statistically significant changes in the haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis 
data were of minimal magnitude, occurred during a predose interval, were not dose-related, likely 
represented individual variation, and/or were not different from the range of control or baseline values. 
Therefore, these changes were not considered toxicologically important by the applicant. 
DXA 
No relevant vosoritide-related changes in BMC and BMD were observed. 
Bone growth 
Increase in length over time for tibia, femur and humerus was observed. Although the growth rates 
were rather variable and the bone lengths at baseline often differed between groups, a more 
pronounced increase in bone length could be seen in general in the mid- and high-dose groups 
compared to vehicle control. 
The per cent change in growth velocity from baseline to Week 13 and from Week 13 to Week 25 is 
depicted in the following figure. From baseline to Week 13, mid- and high-dose vosoritide numerically 
increased growth velocity of tibia, femur and humerus compared to vehicle control; statistical 
significance obviously was not reached, but  this can be related to the low number of animals. From 
Week 13 to Week 25 the vosoritide effect on bone growth was less pronounced and more variable 
(longer error bars).

Mechanical strength of the bone 
Three-point bend test of the femur and compression of lumbar vertebra LV3 were performed. There 
were only small and inconsistent changes in the mechanical bone parameters (maximum load, 
stiffness, energy, stress, elastic modulus and toughness) with vosoritide treatment. 
Serum bone/cartilage markers 
The bone formation markers PINP, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (bone-specific) displayed 
small changes in both directions (increase or decrease) in the different dose groups and at different 
time points. The same is true for the bone resorption markers CTx I and NTx and for the marker of 
cartilage degeneration, CTx II. Thus, taken together, there were no clear and consistent effects of 
vosoritide on bone turnover. 
Macroscopic observations 
Vosoritide-related macroscopic findings were limited to bones. The following observations were made: 
The shape of the proximal end of the femur (femoral head) was bilaterally abnormal in two animals of 
the high-dose group. 
Microscopic observations 
Vosoritide-related microscopic findings were limited to bones.  
There were no vosoritide-related changes in the L1 to L4 vertebral length, foramen magnum 
dimensions, or skull measurements. At the end of the dosing phase, daily treatment with vosoritide 
resulted in dose-dependent increases in the area and height of proximal femur growth plate in all 
treatment groups when compared with the controls. Microscopic examination showed increased 
thickness of the proliferative and hypertrophic/calcified zones of physeal cartilage that was generally 
minimal to mild in all treatment groups. Disorganised chondrocyte columnar arrange in the 
proliferative zone was also observed in males and females treated with ≥90 µg/kg. Increased thickness 
of the primary spongiosa was also seen in all treatment groups. These findings had resolved in females 
by the end of the recovery period but were still present in 2/3 males treated with 300 μg/kg. These 
findings are consistent with pharmacologic effects of vosoritide on skeletal growth and previous 
observations in this species. 
Genotoxicity 
Vosoritide is a peptide containing only natural amino acids. In concordance with ICHS6 genotoxicity 
studies are not considered useful for natural peptides.   
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with vosoritide.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity 
In line with the initially proposed indication „treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and 
older and whose epiphyses are not closed“, a full range of reproductive and juvenile toxicity studies 
were conducted under consideration of the respective ICH guidelines. All pivotal studies were 
conducted in compliance with GLP regulations.  
Rats were used for the assessment of possible vosoritide induced adverse effects on male and female 
fertility, as well as on prenatal and postnatal development. Rabbits served as second species for 
detection of possible drug-related impacts on prenatal development. Juvenile toxicity studies were 
performed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys covering the human age range from birth to young 
adulthood. 
To address fertility and early development, a rat study was conducted. Male and female rats were 
treated daily prior to cohabitation for mating (28 days for males and 15 days for females) with 0, 90, 
270, or 540 μg/kg/day vosoritide. Seminal vesicle weights with and without fluid were significantly 
decreased relative to the vehicle group in all test-article groups in a dose-response fashion. Slightly 
increased time to mate and significant decreases in sperm count and density were observed at least at 
540 µg/kg, but these findings were not considered adverse by the study director due to lack of any 
impact on the fertility index. 
Embryofetal development (EFD) studies were conducted in rats and rabbits, respectively. Vosoritide 
did not induce maternal toxicity or affect prenatal development in either species.  In both studies, the 
maternal and developmental NOAELs were set at the top doses of 540 µg/kg/day in rats and 240 
µg/kg/d in rabbits, respectively. This is agreed.  
Dosages for the pivotal rabbit EFD study were selected on the results of the DRF study. In the DRF 
study, the high dose of 240 µg/kg/day affected fetal viability and fetal body weights. Such effects were 
not seen in the pivotal study despite identical doses as in the DRF study were administered. However, 
this is not a concern, as exposures were far above the human exposure.  
In rats, placenta transfer of vosoritide appears to be minimal if at all, the concentrations of 
vosoritide on lactation day 14 in the milk were less than 5% of plasma. 
A study of pre- and postnatal development revealed that treatment of pregnant rats did not adversely 
affect gestation, natural delivery, and maternal behaviour during lactation.  
Prenatal development and postnatal development including assessment of learning and memory as 
well as reproductive capacity, was not affected by treatment of dams up to the highest dose tested. 
In dams, mean plasma concentrations at 30 minutes post-dose on lactation day 14, increased with 
increasing dose from 90 to 540 µg/kg. In general, the concentrations of vosoritide on lactation day 14 
in the milk were less than 5% of plasma. When estimable, the milk to plasma concentration ratios 
ranged from 0.0130 to 0.0473 at 270 µg/kg and from 0.0162 to 0.0502 at 540 µg/kg. 
In all but one pup, no vosoritide was detected in blood samples collected on PND 1 and 14. However, 
one pup born to a high dose mother had a quantifiable concentration of 0.137 ng/mL, which is slightly 
above the lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL).  
The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats was 540 
µg/kg/day, which corresponds to a plasma concentration range of 16.0 to 42.3 ng/mL at 30 minutes 
post-dose on lactation day 14.

Juvenile animal studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Pivotal studies were 
preceded by preliminary toxicological assessments in a 21-day pilot feasibility study in juvenile rats 
and in an escalating dose range finding/7-day repeat dose toxicity and safety pharmacology study in 
telemeterised juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, respectively.  
A 28-day toxicity/TK study was conducted in juvenile monkeys, while in both species 26-week toxicity 
/ TK studies were carried out spanning the age from infancy (7-day-old rats) to pre/peripubescence (2-
3-year-old cynomolgus monkeys) at study initiation. The selected age ranges at treatment start are 
considered adequate for the paediatric age group to be treated, and the subsequent treatments for 26 
weeks cover all stages of development until the end of sexual maturation and attainment of 
reproductive capacity in rats, and at least into adolescence in monkeys. The treatment period does not 
include the time of closure of the growth plates, which is around an age of 11 months in rats, and 
around 57 months in female and 63 months in male cynomolgus monkeys, respectively (S. H. Kilborn 
et al, CONTEMPORARY TOPICS, 2002 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science, 
Volume 41, No. 5). However, this approach is fully in line with the initially proposed indication of 
„treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and older and whose epiphyses are not 
closed.” 
Aside from standard toxicological assessment, skeletal changes were monitored through bone length 
measurement, radiological evaluations, and/or histological and histomorphometric analysis of the 
growth plates. Evaluation of possible drug related impact on reproductive development and capacity 
was part of the juvenile rat study, while cardiovascular effects were monitored in the course of the 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys using High Definition Oscillometry (HDO) for BP in combination with 
Jacketed External Telemetry (JET) for HR and ECG waveforms. Reversibility of any adverse finding was 
assessed in both species at the end of a recovery period. 
The 26-week toxicity study in juvenile rats was quite extensive with almost 550 pups included. There 
were four subsets of animals, either allocated to the main or the recovery parts of the study or used 
for evaluation of TK and anti-drug antibodies levels, respectively. A fourth subset of rats was assessed 
for possible drug-induced adverse effects on reproductive capacity. Several developmental milestones 
were evaluated during the preweaning or post-weaning period.  
Treatment of juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 188 by daily subcutaneous injection of 10, 
30, or 90 μg/kg/day led to a dose-related increase in bone lesions, reductions of bone minerality and 
density, and reduced biomechanics that corresponded to in vivo observations of reduced limb and joint 
function and abnormal appearance of joints due to swelling and displaced articular surfaces. These 
changes were not observed in vivo during early development, with increases in growth (crown-rump 
and tail length), reduction of BMD/BMC, and clinical signs related to bone overgrowth largely not 
appearing until rats reached adolescence to adulthood (approximately 8-15 weeks of age). There was a 
sex difference in incidence and severity of skeletal effects on study, which was likely due to higher 
vosoritide exposures in males. There were no apparent effects on the behavioural or sexual 
development of juvenile rats related to treatment with vosoritide.  
The NOAEL for juvenile rats treated for 26 weeks was determined to be 10 µg/kg/day due to the low 
prevalence and severity of findings at this dose level, which can be agreed. This dose corresponds to a 
Cmax of 680 pg/mL and AUC0-t of 22,842 pg*min/mL in males and a mean Cmax of 527 pg/mL and 
AUC0-t of 10,133 pg*min/mL in females on PND 188.

In juvenile monkeys, a dose range finding / dose escalating study in 3-year-old monkeys was 
conducted prior to the pivotal studies, one with 28 days of treatment and another one with 26 weeks 
of treatment, respectively. In both studies, recovery periods were included after the end of treatment.  
Monkeys were 2 to 3 years old at treatment initiation, an age considered equivalent to preadolescence 
in humans. As in rats, subsequent treatment for 26 weeks covers preadolescence, and at least part of 
adolescence.  
Drug-related effects were limited to skeletal overgrowth and subsequent functional changes in the 
joints, particularly at the head and neck of the femur and hip joint. Clinically significant effects in 
males included limited ambulation and posture changes, possibly due to higher Cmax values on Day 85. 
No such relationship was apparent for the single affected female. Mild increases in reactogenicity at the 
injection site were attributed to treatment with vosoritide and likely related to or enhanced by immune 
responses to the test article. Due to the persistent bone and joint clinical effects observed in animals 
treated with 300 µg/kg, the NOAEL for daily chronic administration in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys is 
90 µg/kg/day corresponding to mean Cmax and AUC0-600m values of 10984 pg/mL and 523098 pg•
min/mL on Day 176. Design and results of the 26wk-study are provided in Table 24.

111-301/302 with a dose of 15 μg/kg vosoritide SC QD for 52 weeks; subjects ≥5y of age: Cmax of 
4710 to 7180 pg/mL and AUC0-∞ of 244000 to 283000 pg*min/mL. For better comparison of animal 
with human values, human exposures values were expressed in ng/ml and ng*min/ml as well (Cmax: 
4.7 – 7.1 ng/ml, and AUC: 244 – 283 ng*min/ml).  
In Table 25, the NOAELs set in the respective study reports were used for comparison with human 
exposure data. Exposure margins at the NOAELs in the 26-week repeated dose toxicity studies in 
juvenile animals are below 1 and around 2 in rats and monkeys, respectively.

The juvenile toxicity studies are considered crucial with regard to the paediatric population to be 
treated. However, the relevance of the findings obtained in healthy animals following long-term 
treatment for use of vosoritide in children born with achondroplasia is not known.  The classic approach 
for risk assessment - comparing exposure margins at the NOAELs with the human exposure - reveals 
no or only small safety margins, but this approach might not be adequate, as the underlying 
exaggerated pharmacology can only partly be taken into account.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a biotechnologically derived peptide analogue to the naturally occurring C-type 
Natriuretic Peptide, consisting of natural amino acids. Its use will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, vosoritide is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Vosoritide is a stable analogue of the endogenous peptide CNP (C-Type natriuretic peptide) and is 
intended to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate via activation of the natriuretic 
peptide receptor NPR-B and consecutive intracellular cGMP production. Thereby, vosoritide is intended 
to counteract the FGFR3 signalling which leads to differentiation of the chondrocytes. In Ach, FGFR3 
signalling is increased by a gain-of-function mutation of this receptor. 
Primary PD studies in vitro demonstrated that vosoritide stimulates cGMP production and chondrocyte 
proliferation; the latter was due to counteracting the anti-proliferative effect of FGF2, a ligand of 
FGFR3.  
The in vivo primary PD studies demonstrated that vosoritide treatment increases bone, tail and body 
length in normal animals and also in animals carrying gain-of-function mutations of FGFR3. Two 
different mouse models were used, each carrying another FGFR3 mutation. One mutation corresponds 
to human Ach and the other to human thanatophoric dysplasia (TD). Besides length measurements, 
vosoritide actions on bone were also measured using further parameters such as serum markers of 
bone and cartilage turnover, DXA scan, X-ray, histology and histomorphometry of the physis and 
mechanical strength. Not all of these parameters were obtained in the animal models of disease but in 
healthy animals within the frame of the repeated-dose toxicology studies. 
The FGFR3 mutations were introduced into an unusual mouse strain called FVB which carries several 
defects unrelated to bone. It was reported that FVB mice carry a mutation in a certain cGMP-specific 
phosphodiesterase (PDE6B) so that increased cGMP levels could result in some tissues. Since the 
biological actions of vosoritide are mediated by intracellular cGMP production, the applicant was 
requested to discuss whether the reaction of FVB mice on vosoritide may differ from the reaction of 
other strains. The applicant explained that the unusual mouse strain was selected for technical 
reasons, because of easier handling of the oocytes for introducing the transgene. The defective gene 
PDE6B, which is involved in cGMP metabolism, is not expressed in the bone, but only in photoreceptive 
cells in mammals, according to published literature. Therefore, the known gene defects on PDE6B of 
this strain most likely do not affect vosoritide action on bone. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Particularly in healthy animals as tested in the repeated-dose toxicity studies, vosoritide at least in 
high doses caused undesired bone effects. These included altered shape, dislocation of physis, 
decreased BMD, reduced mechanical stability, altered histology of the growth plate and consecutive 
impairment of gait and hind limb use. The reason for these observations is not clear; the applicant 
suggested a faster-than-normal bone growth caused by vosoritide in these healthy animals and 
pointed out that FGFR3 knock-out mice, which also show increased bone growth, have a similar 
phenotype. However, it cannot be excluded that vosoritide directly leads to irregular bone growth, 
independent of growth velocity. In animals of disease, functional impairment of hind limbs was hardly 
observed. In the 5-week-study in Ach mice, tail kinking was observed already at vosoritide doses 
which did not cause a higher-than-normal growth rate.  
The applicant pointed out that knock-out of the FGFR3 gene in mice as described in the publication by 
Colvin et al. 1996 (Nature Genetics 12: 390-397) also displayed increased bone growth that was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 76/191 
 
 
 
irregular and led to misshaped bones. The applicant therefore argued that irregular bone growth is a 
consequence of strong FGFR3 inhibition. This can be achieved by vosoritide in healthy animals but 
most likely not in Ach patients or animal models thereof because in this case the basal FGFR3 activity 
is much higher. Furthermore, it is not intended to suppress FGFR3 activity in Ach to levels less than 
normal. These arguments are understood by the CHMP. However, the applicant was requested to 
comment on three aspects. First, FGFR3 knock-out mainly affects other bones than those affected by 
vosoritide treatment (eE.g., FGFR3 KO leads to prominent kyphosis / scoliosis and curved femur and 
humerus). In contrast, vosoritide treatment affected hip and tibia, see toxicology section 2.3.4. ). 
Second, disordered chondrocyte arrangement in the growth plate, a consistent finding with vosoritide, 
was obviously not observed in FGFR3 KO mice (Fig. 3d of the Colvin publication). Third, vosoritide is 
assumed to inhibit only one signalling pathway of FGFR3, the MAPK pathway. The STAT1 pathway 
remains unaffected. Further pathways can also couple to FGFR3, e.g. PI3K and PLC, but their role in 
chondrocytes is unknown (Ornitz and Legeai-Mallet 2017, Developmental Dynamics 246: 291-309). 
Thus, vosoritide cannot be expected to counteract all FGFR3 actions so that the peptide will cause 
findings which differ from complete FGFR3 inhibition or knock-out. Another aspect is that in case of 
FGFR3 KO animals the receptor is absent during the whole period of embryo-foetal bone development 
whereas vosorotide was administered later in life. The applicant discussed potential reasons for the 
observed morphological differences resulting from FGFR3 knock-out vs. vosoritide treatment. There is 
no clear explanation why the FGFR3 knock-out phenotype differs from the morphological changes 
induced by vosoritide treatment. No meaningful conclusions could be drawn and the issue of FGFR3-KO 
was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
An early sign of irregular bone growth could be the observed disarrangement of the columnar order of 
the chondrocytes in the growth plate. According to the applicant, in TD mice the chondrocytes are 
disordered as such. For Ach, the situation is less clear. The applicant stated that disarrangement also 
occurs in Ach mice and in humans suffering from Ach. However, literature reports do not indicate that 
chondrocyte disarrangement in the growth plate is a typical sign of Ach in humans (Ponseti, J of Bone 
and Joint Surgery 1970, 52-A: 701-716; Rimoin et al., New Engl J Med 1970, 238: 728-735; Briner et 
al. 1991, Path Res Pract 187: 271-278). Published data indicate that in Ach the normal architecture of 
the growth plate, i.e. linear arrangement of the chondrocytes as columns or oblong clusters, is at least 
partly preserved; the cells and clusters are smaller and fewer in Ach than in healthy subjects. In 
contrast, in the TD mouse model used by the applicant, this architecture was largely destroyed; again, 
chondrocytes were smaller and fewer. Vosoritide was able to increase chondrocyte number and size 
but did not improve the linear, longitudinal ordering of the chondrocytes. On the other hand, vosoritide 
affected the normal chondrocyte ordering in the growth plates of normal animals, leading to functional 
impairment of the adjacent joints, probably due to irregular or asymmetric bone growth. Based on the 
above-mentioned findings, it cannot be excluded that vosoritide may exert adverse effects on bone 
and joint with long-term treatment. The applicant has agreed to follow up this issue post-marketing. 
There was no strong correlation between disturbed chondrocyte arrangement in the hypertrophic zone 
and joint damage so that other factors probably have also contributed to joint degeneration. The 
applicant reported uneven growth of the acetabular cartilage as a likely reason for impaired hip 
function and hip joint degeneration. According to published literature (reviewed by Peake et al., 
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 22, 2014: 1800-1807), CNP signalling not only plays a role in the growth 
plate but in chondrocytes in general. Therefore, the observed joint damage in the toxicology studies 
could be largely due to direct action of vosoritide on the articular cartilage. Exogenous CNP, especially 
at high doses, may disturb the delicate balance of endogenous factors that ensure normal chondrocyte 
function and proportional growth. In contrast to healthy animals, vosoritide can re-install the balance 
between CNP and growth factors in animal models of Ach and TD. This can explain why adverse joint 
effects were hardly observed in Ach and TD animals. If this assumed mechanism were true, vosoritide 
would be unlikely to cause adverse joint effects in Ach patients. However, uncertainties remain 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 77/191 
 
 
 
regarding the possibility of damage and functional impairment of the large joints and will be followed-
up postmarketing. 
Beside its effects on chondrocytes in the growth plate, vosoritide also had cardiovascular effects as 
revealed in safety pharmacology studies. There was a transient increase in heart rate for a few 
hours after dosing and a – less pronounced – decrease in blood pressure. After repeated dosing the 
effect on blood pressure decreased; no such accommodation was observed in respect to heart rate. 
The cardiovascular effects of vosoritide can be explained by its relationship to atrial natriuretic peptide 
(ANP). In general, CV-related effects were observed in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels in the 
range of the anticipated clinical dose in humans (15 µg/kg). The CV effects observed in cynomolgus 
monkeys are adequately addressed in Section 5.3 of the SmPC and precautions for use to reduce the 
risk of potential blood pressure decrease are included in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Vosoritide’s inhibitory effect on the hERG channel was studied in vitro. Due to technical issues, data 
from higher vosortide concentrations could not be evaluated. The calculated safety margins between 
the concentration tested in the hERG assay and the Cmax values observed in the Phase 3 clinical study 
and in the Phase 2 clinical study as well as the highest plasma levels achieved in toxicology studies 
were at least 500-fold. Based on these safety margins, it is acceptable to the CHMP that data on high 
vosortide concentrations in the hERG assay are not available.  
Secondary PD: Inhibitory effects were seen on eight receptors/channels, including NPR-A, in the 
SpectrumScreen® test. However, the observed IC50 values of vosoritide in that assay are by more 
than 3 orders of magnitude higher than the mean Cmax at week 52 in patients treated with 15 µg/kg 
vosoritide. No relevant off-target effects are thus expected in patients. 
The applicant did not conduct PD interaction studies. However, based on vosoritide’s mechanism of 
action (indirect inhibition of Fgfr3 downstream signalling), pharmacodynamic interactions with other 
drugs affecting this pathway or parts thereof are conceivable. The applicant discussed this possibility 
and identified potential interactions of vosoritide with drugs that bind to NPR-B or have a 
pharmacologic activity within the ERK1/2/MAPK pathway or drugs binding to the NPR-C receptor that 
could reduce vosoritide clearance via this mechanism. The applicant concluded that interactions with 
vosoritide are not relevant to the target population since the only approved drugs with potential 
interactions are authorised in Europe for use in adults only mainly for the treatment of decompensated 
heart failure, moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome and certain cancer drugs, but none of these 
drugs are approved for use in children. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics: Plasma levels of vosoritide over time were obtained in several PK and toxicology 
studies for calculation of AUC, Cmax, t1/2 and related parameters in different species. AUC and Cmax 
increased with dose markedly more than proportionally. In general, the exposure following a given 
dose was higher in males than in females. 
The applicant provided only limited information about absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion. It is acceptable that the ADME programme is reduced for an injected peptide. 
Absorption from the subcutaneous space was not further investigated. This is acceptable to the CHMP 
because vosoritide is not a depot formulation or anything else for which special mechanisms of 
deposition and absorption in the SC space play a role. 
Plasma protein binding was not measured. According to the applicant, high plasma protein binding is 
unlikely due to the fact that vosoritide is extensively metabolised and rapidly eliminated from plasma. 
Plasma protein binding is thus not expected to play a significant role in the elimination of vosoritide. 
The issue was not further pursued by the CHMP since the potential influence was not considered 
clinically relevant.

For determination of distribution, vosoritide labelled with the radioactive isotope iodine-124 was 
injected. PET scans were performed thereafter in living animals to determine tissue distribution over 
time. In another study, radioactivity of I-124 was counted in selected tissues. Vosoritide mainly 
accumulated in the stomach after SC injection for unknown reasons. According to the applicant, this 
could be due to free iodine, liberated from labelled vosoritide. A sodium/iodide symporter is expressed 
in the stomach. The hypothesis was considered plausible to the CHMP, however, if the distribution 
pattern observed was indeed influenced by dissociation and subsequent accumulation of free iodine, it 
would have been expected that the thyroid would have been the primary source of radioactivity. This 
point could not be further elucidated since the thyroid was not investigated. The issue was not further 
pursued by the CHMP since the signals would not harbour vosoritide-relevant safety relevance. Low 
activity was found in the brain. CNS safety studies did not indicate CNS effects of vosoritide but their 
conduct was hampered by vosoritide-related impairment of motility after repeated dosing. 
Biodistribution was only studied in male mice and rats. Biodistribution of vosoritide was primarily in the 
periphery, with most vosoritide remaining at the injection site, in plasma circulation, and in highly 
perfused organs. This is as expected for a peptide or small protein for which the major distribution 
mechanism is passive diffusion and most likely not influenced by sex. Further, biodistribution was only 
studied in adolescent (7 to 9 weeks-old rats) and young adult (8 to 10 weeks-old mice) animals, but 
not in juvenile or infant animals. The applicant argued that further to the vosoritide distribution 
pattern, the pharmacodynamics target tissues are the bones and that no soft tissue off-target toxicity 
was observed in the non-clinical studies. Finally, the applicant noted that growth velocity and 
tolerability of vosoritide in clinical studies were comparable across the investigated paediatric age 
subgroups. Therefore, although Ach patients are of younger age, the CHMP agreed that conducting 
non-clinical biodistribution in younger than juvenile animals is not expected to add to the overall 
understanding of vosoritide action. 
Metabolism of vosoritide was not further characterised. It was shown that – as expected – vosoritide is 
not a substrate of CYP enzymes. Based on theoretical considerations, cleavage of amino acids from the 
C-terminus of vosoritide could lead to active metabolites. However, it remains unclear whether C-
terminal cleavage takes place and – if yes – which amount of active metabolites is formed. Since 
vosoritide is a peptide, it is not expected that toxic metabolites are formed so that lack of metabolism 
studies is not a toxicological concern. Whether presence of active metabolites has to be taken into 
consideration when measuring plasma exposure and correlating this with the therapeutic action of 
vosoritide is a clinical problem. Thus, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP from a non-
clinical point of view, and was discussed as part of the clinical assessment (see Section 2.4.4. of the 
assessment report). 
The applicant has not studied the route of excretion of vosoritide. A salient PK finding was a marked, 
higher than proportional, increase in Cmax and AUC with increasing dose. This could be due to 
saturation of the excretion mechanism. The applicant presented a possible explanation by noting that 
scavenger receptors for CNP (which also recognise vosoritide) are located in adipose tissue, i.e. close 
to the subcutaneous space and thereby close to the injection site. Thus, it is conceivable that 
vosoritide in lower doses largely becomes eliminated by these local scavenger receptors and that these 
receptors become saturated upon injection of higher doses. This proposed mechanism was not 
substantiated with data by the applicant. The applicant also did not provide information to which 
extent different routes of elimination (e.g. receptor-mediated scavenge and proteolytic degradation) 
are used. Thus, the reason for the salient more-than proportional increase in exposure with dose 
remains unclear. Finding of a suitable therapeutic dose in humans is addressed by clinical data, 
therefore the lack of respective non-clinical data was acceptable to the CHMP. 
The involvement of glomerular filtration in excretion of vosoritide is also unknown. Based on theoretical 
considerations, the applicant concluded that glomerular filtration does not play a relevant role for the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 79/191 
 
 
 
excretion of vosoritide. Thus, non-clinical data did not allow to conclude whether there is a need for 
dose adjustment in case of renal insufficiency, this issue was addressed based on clinical data.  
The potential for transporter inhibition by vosoritide has been excluded based on in vitro 
investigations. Literature data suggest that endogenous CNP is not a substrate or inhibitor of common 
transporter proteins. 
The toxicology programme was considered adequate by the CHMP. Repeated-dose studies were 
performed in rodents (rats) and non-rodents (cynomolgus monkeys) for sufficiently long duration, up 
to 44 weeks (10 months) in monkeys and up to 26 weeks (6 months) in rats. Part of the repeated-
dose studies were performed in juvenile animals.  
Across all studies, the predominant findings were changes in long bones and joints. These were most 
pronounced in the high-dose groups of rats and monkeys but occasionally also present in the mid-dose 
group. The most salient effect was impaired function of the hind limbs. This was accompanied by 
morphological changes of tibia, femur and acetabulum, damage of articular cartilage, alterations in 
biomechanical strength testing and histological alterations in the growth plate, indicating irregular 
growth of the bone. The latter mainly consisted of disordering of the columnar chondrocyte 
arrangement. In rats, hind limb impairment was accompanied or preceded by the sign of kinked or 
bended tail. The latter signs could also be related to irregular bone growth, of the vertebrae of this 
case. The applicant claimed that the mentioned bone findings are related to exaggerated bone growth 
and are not expected when the basal growth rate is reduced by Ach. This issue is further discussed 
above, in the frame of the PD studies. 
It is conceivable that, at least in healthy animals, CNP or vosoritide enhance chondrocyte proliferation 
in some undirected fashion so that the columnar arrangement in the growth plate becomes 
increasingly lost during growth. In consequence, growth could become irregular, resulting in 
misshaped bone and impairment of joints. Animal data cannot definitely answer the question whether 
this could also happen in Ach patients. Thus, this issue will be further investigated post-marketing, 
taking into account that Ach itself can lead to impaired function of extremities and joints. 
According to a publication (Colvin et al. 1996, Nature Genetics 12: 390-397), complete loss of FGF3R 
by knock-out in mice led to inner ear defects and deafness. It appears likely that the inner ear defects 
come from absence of FGFR3 during embryo-fetal development. Thus, post-natal inhibition of FGFR3 
signalling by vosoritide most likely does not affect the inner ear. This is also supported by the finding 
that the startle response was unaltered by vosoritide in the CNS safety pharmacology studies, 
indicating normal hearing of the animals. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed, based on physiological consideration deriving from the 
knowledge on CNP. The applicant provided reasons why no further tissue evaluation in the disease 
model have been performed and notes that in the chronic toxicology studies with vosoritide in rat and 
cynomolgus monkeys no evidence for preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions was found. A carcinogenic risk 
assessment was performed by the applicant. The molecular mode of action with cross talk of FGFR3 
and CNP/vosoritide is outlined with special focus on potential relations of FGFR3 signalling and cancer. 
It outlines that for inhibition of FGFR3 downstream signalling by NPR-B activation with CNP/vosoritide 
an effect similar to direct FGFR3 inhibition can be expected. FGFR3 inhibition is considered to have an 
inhibitory effect on urothelial carcinomas. Furthermore, studies in published literature were cited 
describing weak but inhibitory effects on tumour cell growth in vitro. In one study this was 
demonstrated to be connected to the generation of cGMP. The applicant notes that in CNP 
overexpressing mice no carcinogenic lesions were reported and also cites a report on inhibition of 
rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts growth in mice by CNP. In addition, publications were cited that 
families with heritable CNP receptor gain-of-function mutations do not show increased cancer 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 80/191 
 
 
 
incidences over 3-4 generations. Taken together, the applicant concludes that a carcinogenic potential 
of vosoritide is not expected. This is endorsed by the CHMP.  
All aspects of reproduction were evaluated in animal studies in line with current guidelines. Vosoritide 
did not affect reproductive parameters except male fertility parameters. Slightly increased time to 
mate, significant decreases in sperm count and density, and significant reductions in seminal vesicle 
weights were observed at least at the top dose of 540 µg/kg, but these findings were not considered 
adverse by the study director due to lack of any impact on the fertility index. The applicant submitted 
historical control data. Based on these data, it was shown that all, except the high dose value for the 
time to mating, were within the historical control range. The CHMP agreed that the delay to mating 
was due to significant effects of treatment on skeletal overgrowth, which affected the ambulation of 
the males and the ability to complete the mating act successfully. In addition, no effects on sperm 
count or other male reproductive parameters were observed in sexually mature nonhuman primates 
treated with up to 250 µg/kg/day vosoritide for 26 and 44 weeks, respectively. 
The observed dose-dependent decreases in seminal vesicle weights in the fertility and early 
development study in rats were within normal historical ranges for Sprague-Dawley rats for all 
treatment groups. No similar observations were noted in any other non-clinical studies. Therefore, this 
observation is not considered biologically meaningful. 
In rats, placenta transfer of vosoritide appears to be minimal if at all, and concentrations of vosoritide 
on lactation day 14 in the milk were less than 5% of plasma.  
Juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in normal rats and monkeys. The selected age ranges at 
treatment start are considered adequate for the pediatric age group to be treated, and the subsequent 
treatments for 26 weeks cover all stages of development until the end of sexual maturation and 
attainment of reproductive capacity in rats, and at least into adolescence in monkeys. In both species, 
the treatment period does not include the time of closure of the growth plates, which is fully in line 
with the proposed indication of „treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and older and 
whose epiphyses are not closed.” Aside from standard toxicological assessment, skeletal changes were 
monitored through bone length measurement, radiological evaluations, and/or histological and 
histomorphometric analysis of the growth plates. Evaluation of possible drug related impact on 
reproductive development and capacity was part of the juvenile rat study, while cardiovascular effects 
were monitored in the course of the studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Adverse findings were limited in 
both species to the skeletal system and were considered due to exaggerated activity characterised by 
clinical observations of bent tails and reduced hind limb mobility and/or disorganisation and reduced 
vascularisation of growth plate microscopically.  
Especially the 26-week juvenile toxicity studies are considered crucial with regard to the paediatric 
population to be treated. However, the relevance of the findings obtained in normal animals following 
long-term treatment, for the use of vosoritide in children born with achondroplasia is not known. The 
classic approach for risk assessment - comparing exposure margins at the NOAELs with the human 
exposure - reveals no or only small safety margins, but this approach might not be adequate, as the 
underlying exaggerated pharmacology can only partly be taken into account. Vosoritide’s effect on 
chondrocyte clustering and alignment and on growth plate histology observed in toxicology studies in 
healthy animals is discussed in more detail in the paragraphs on primary PD. The available information 
indicates that vosoritide would be unlikely to cause adverse joint effects in Ach patients. However, 
uncertainties remain regarding the possibility of damage and functional impairment of the large joints 
and this will be followed-up post-marketing. 
ANP increased in a dose-dependent manner in one repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. No consequences of the increasing ANP levels on diuresis or natriuresis were observed. Such 
increases in ANP levels were only observed in adult cynomolgus monkeys, but not in juvenile ones. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 81/191 
 
 
 
This was identical to humans, in which ANP increases were observed in adult subjects of the conduct 
phase I study, but not in paediatric patients of later clinical studies. According to the applicant, the 
potential molecular mechanisms could include competition of endogenous ANP and vosoritide for the 
natriuretic peptide clearing receptor NPR-C. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
No standalone local tolerance studies were conducted, as the respective endpoints were included in 
repeated dose toxicity studies. This is acceptable to the CHMP. Inefficient recovery of injection site 
lesions was observed in the cynomolgus monkey repeated dose toxicity Study BMN111-11-043, the 
applicant noted that mononuclear cell inflammatory responses can be self-perpetuating due to 
chemokine-release and subsequent recruitment of additional cells to the site, according to published 
literature (Shi, 2011). This explanation is supported by the CHMP. 
Thymic changes were observed in some non-clinical studies. The thymus is known to be sensitive 
towards – among others - severe stress, poor nutrition and thin body condition. Thus, the observed 
thymus weight decreases probably were caused by increased stress levels due to test-article related 
exaggerated pharmacological adverse effects and therefore are considered of little relevance. This is 
agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
It was demonstrated that vosoritide increased bone growth in healthy animals and in disease models. 
However, bone growth was somewhat irregular, leading to kinked tails in rats and to impaired function 
of the hind limbs in rats and monkeys, at least in healthy animals. In animal models of disease, the 
picture was less clear since Ach itself can impair joint and limb function. With the non-clinical data 
presented including literature data and mechanistic considerations, it is not possible to fully exclude 
irregular bone growth with consecutive functional impairment in human Ach patients upon vosoritide 
treatment. As Ach itself leads to functional impairment, care has to be taken to distinguish effects of 
the underlying disease and vosoritide effects. The applicant has agreed to follow-up this issue post-
marketing through additional pharmacovigilance activities (see Section 2.7. on Risk Management Plan). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The human pharmacokinetic properties of vosoritide were assessed in 3 in vitro studies performed 
using human biomaterials and 7 clinical studies. 
Bioanalytical methods: 
Samples from PK/PD studies were analysed at BioMarin using two assay approaches, a quantitative 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), used in the earlier studies, and an 
electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLA) designed to improve sensitivity and range of quantitation (in 
the later studies). Overall, the presented data demonstrate suitability of the assays. 
Assay validation data were also presented for several biomarkers, as well as for anti-drug antibodies 
(ADAs), which were overall considered acceptable. 
Absorption  
Studies conducted: 
No absolute bioavailability and human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies have been performed for vosoritide. 
Pharmacokinetics evaluations were part of the designs of 7 interventional clinical studies (111-101, 
111-202, 111-205, 111-206, 111-301 and 111-302) and were conducted in healthy volunteer adult 
male subjects, and children with a confirmed diagnosis of ACH.  
In Study 111-101, the only study in healthy subjects, daily SC administrations of vosoritide 15 μg/kg 
were rapidly absorbed, reaching a median Tmax of 15 to 30 min. Increase in Cmax with dose was 
approximately greater than dose proportional from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg and increase in AUC0-t was 
approximately greater than dose proportional from 5 to 15 µg/kg. At 15 µg/kg, the mean ± SD of CL/F 
and Vz/F at 15 µg/kg was 20.3 ± 11.3 mL/min/kg and 1500 ± 530 mL/kg, respectively. The mean t1/2 
was 69.5 min. Overall changes in vosoritide exposure (Cmax and AUC0-t) were minimal with repeat 
dosing out to 10 days. 
While full PK profiles were determined in the HVs study 111-101, all other studies were conducted in 
the target population, and hence rather restricted PK sampling was applied. Due to the vulnerability of 
the population, and the properties of the substance with rapid clearance, the applied sampling 
schedule appears nevertheless appropriate. 
In Studies 111-202/205 and 111-301/302, daily SC administrations of vosoritide 15 μg/kg were 
rapidly absorbed in ACH subjects aged ≥5 years, reaching a median Tmax of 15 min. At 15 µg/kg, over 
a treatment period of 52 weeks, mean t1/2 ranged from 21.0 to 27.9 minutes. Mean Cmax, and AUC0-
∞ ranged from 4710 to 7180 pg/mL and 244000 to 283000 pg-min/mL respectively. Mean CL/F and 
Vz/F ranged from 79.4 to 104 mL/min/kg and 2880 to 3020 mL/kg, respectively. Increase in exposure 
(Cmax and AUC0-t) was greater than proportional with dose from 2.5 to 30 μg/kg. 
In Study 111-301, PK parameters at 15 µg/kg were consistent throughout the 12 months of 
treatment. The mean (± SD) peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve 
from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) observed after 52 weeks of treatment 
was 5,800 (±3,680), and 290,000 (± 235,000) pg-min/mL respectively.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 85/191 
 
 
 
 
In the single-dose part of study 111-202, the PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-t increased greater 
than proportional to the increase in dose across the dose range of 2.5 to 30.0 μg/kg. 
In Studies 111-202 and 111-205, PK parameters at 15 and 30 µg/kg were consistent up to 60 
months. There was no evidence of accumulation observed following a once daily injection. 
Furthermore, population PK results indicated that body weight is the only significant covariate for 
vosoritide clearance and volume of distribution which supports dosing by weight. 
In Study 111-206, over 52 weeks of treatment at 15 µg/kg daily, the mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of 
ACH subjects aged 2 to 5 years were generally consistent with 15 µg/kg in older ACH subjects (aged 5-
18 years), ranging from 3810 to 6860 pg/mL and 118000 to 350000 pg-min/mL, respectively. Median 
Tmax ranged from 14.0 to 15.5 minutes, and mean t1/2 ranged from 15.2 to 29.3 minutes. Mean CL/F 
and Vz/F ranged from 82.1 to 150 mL/min/kg and 2650 to 3800 mL/kg respectively. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution in the Phase III Study 111-301 conducted in ACH patients aged 5 to 
18 years ranged from 2880 to 3020 mL/kg. This was comparable to the volume of distribution 
observed in patients dosed 15 µg/kg in the Phase II study 111-202. 
The mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution in Study 111-301 after 52 weeks of treatment was 
2,910 (± 1,660) mL/kg. 
Elimination 
Beside protease-mediated catabolism and NPR-C receptor mediated uptake, the applicant presumes 
that renal excretion is one of the elimination pathways for vosoritide. 
The mean half-life of vosoritide in subjects aged 5-18 years ranged from 21.0 to 27.9 minutes. The 
mean clearance in Study 111-301 ranged from 79.4 to 104 mL/min/kg. The mean (± SD) apparent 
clearance after 52 weeks of treatment was 79.4 (53.0) mL/min/kg. The mean (± SD) half-life was 27.9 
(9.9) minutes.  
It is noted that the compound is rapidly absorbed, has a very short half-life, which is under 1 hour in 
all cases in patients (and only slightly above in healthy volunteers), and the compound is also rapidly 
cleared from circulation. The pathways for elimination itself have not been elucidated in detail due to 
the character of the molecule and its rapid elimination from circulation. Only theoretical considerations 
on pathways of elimination are therefore available, but this can be accepted. Based on the character of 
the substance, data from animals, and theoretical considerations (including the clinical relevance in the 
target population) it is also finally accepted that no data are available in patients with hepatic and 
renal impairment. An influence is, however, not expected. The only special population addressed is, of 
course, children, which is the target population of the compound. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Overall, the PK of the compound has not been found to be linear (only for Cmax in healthy volunteers), 
but greater than proportional increases were found with higher doses, both for Cmax and AUC. Based 
on the sparse sampling data, dose-non-proportionality has also been confirmed after multiple 
administration based on data from study 111-202.  
Findings suggest that there is an increase in bioavailability over time, for which it is most likely that it 
relates to weight gain over time. Accumulation as potential reason for this phenomenon has been

excluded due to the rapid clearance of the substance from circulation. The applicant has implemented 
an improved weight-band based dosing, considering the increase of bioavailability with weight/time. 
The weight-band based dosing regimen is acceptable, despite the dosing ranging partly outside the 
dose administered throughout the clinical study at the extremes of the weight range due to the fact 
that it provides a consistent exposure over the full range of weight categories. Due to potential safety 
concerns at the lower end of the weight categories, the submission of the final results for the cohort of 
the very young children (which is treated with a 30µg/kg dose) will be relevant for the final 
confirmation of safety. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-individual variability for the PK parameters observed in the Phase II study 111-202 and the 
Phase III study 111-301 was moderate to high. According to the Pop PK report, the inter-individual 
variability for CL/F was 33.6%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
With the exception of study 111-101, the PK of vosoritide has mainly been documented in the target 
population of ACH patients. Therefore, the studies contributing to the description of pharmacokinetics 
have already been described in detail above. 
As a consequence of the intended target population, for which treatment after closure of the bone 
growth plates does not make sense, no adult or even elderly patients were included in the 
development programme.  
Special populations 
The results of the individual studies did not raise concerns. However, the PK documentation submitted, 
does overall not contain a consistent cross-study comparison of results. The influence of demographic 
factors on PK has additionally been presented. This showed that PK is not influenced by gender and 
race or ethnicity (with a caveat based on the low number of black patients included), but is dependent 
on age and weight, with increased plasma concentrations in higher weight bands, which is likely to be 
responsible also for the age effect. The concentration of the compound in the ranges provided in the 
product to be commercialised (0.8 mg/ml and 2.0 mg/dl) did not influence PK in relevant manner. The 
applicant has also evaluated intrinsic/demographic factors for their influence on PK only in the 
modelling exercise, and has similarly found body weight and in addition the concentration of the 
compound being the only significant factors influencing PK. The apparent clearance and volume of 
distribution of vosoritide increased with increasing body weight in patients with achondroplasia (9 to 
74.5 kg). However, the influence of concentration was only applicable for the low concentration of 0.2 
mg/ml used in early development.  
Only limited data on PK were available for the age group below 5 years of age, for which only 4 
“sentinel” subjects had been evaluated for PK in the initial submission. Additional data have been 
submitted, and the PK data now include a total of 18 sentinel and randomised Cohort 1 subjects up to 
52 weeks. The updated results provided sufficient evidence suggesting that at 15 µg/kg, exposure 
from study 111-206 Cohort 1 subjects aged 2 to < 5 years was similar to that from subjects aged 5 
to 18 years in study 111-301 (Figure 20).

and 111-301 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug-drug interactions: 
The applicant has conducted only a limited number of in-vitro studies in order to evaluate the potential 
of the compound for causing drug-drug interactions. The studies conducted are considered sufficient to 
rule out a relevant potential for cytochrome-, as well as transporter-based interactions. The in-vitro 
studies conducted have also made unlikely that metabolic (cytochrome) based degradation plays a 
relevant role in the elimination of the compound. Degradation of the compound itself has only been 
addressed in theoretical manner. As a small peptide, vosoritide is expected to be cleared primarily by 
protease-mediated catabolism, receptor mediated clearance via NPR-C and renal elimination. The 
enzymes responsible for degradation have not been finally characterised. However, this can be 
accepted based on the rapid clearance of the compound. The potential for genetic differences (of the 
target-receptor) or endopeptidases have also not been assessed, but theoretical considerations 
considerations on dual mutations or potential mutations of the metabolising enzymes have made it 
very unlikely that mutations of that kind would occur concomitantly with the FGF3R mutation 
responsible for ACH. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Bioequivalence 
The applicant has presented evidence that no relevant changes to the formulation have occurred 
during the development, and that after early development, the proposed formulations used in phase 2 
and 3 of the development are not relevantly or not at all different from the to-be-marketed formulation 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 88/191 
 
 
 
 
 
in terms of qualitative and quantitative composition. In addition, the two strengths to be marketed 
have both been included in the clinical phase 3 trial programme. Differences between formulations are 
therefore not expected. An additional investigation of PK (based on sparse sampling) of two of the 
proposed injection sites have not revealed differences between two of the injection sites (buttock and 
thigh). The alteration of injection sites was also included in the clinical administration schedule during 
the phase 2 and phase 3 trials, no further concern arises.  
The impact of injection site locations on exposure were evaluated in the population PK analysis. The 
results for the influence of the location of administration indicate a very similar mean rate and extent 
of exposure, both for single dose, as well as for steady state. 
Impact of antibody formation on PK: 
The applicant has also undertaken an analysis of the impact of antibody formation on the PK of 
vosoritide. While a considerable part of patients (but none of the healthy subjects) included in the 
programme developed at least transient antibodies, all analysis conducted did not show an impact of 
antibody formation on the PK of the compound. 
PPK-Modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis for vosoritide was performed with data from 158 ACH patients 
(4741 observations finally included from 6181 observations in total) from studies 111-202, 111-
205, 111-206, 111-301 and 111-302. Data from study 111-101, a study with 22 healthy male 
adults was not included because PPK parameters were too different.  
The PPK database included data from patients ranging in age from 0.95 to 15 years (mean age was 
8.43 years). Weight ranged from 9 kg to 74.5 kg (mean baseline weight was 23.8 kg). Actual daily 
doses included 2.5 μg/kg/day (6 patients), 7.5 μg/kg/day (12 patients), 15 μg/kg/day (151 patients) 
and 30 μg/kg/day (11 patients). By race there were 114 White, 6 Black or African American, 28 Asian 
and 10 Other or Unknown. 
Two different analytical assays were used to determine vosoritide concentrations ELISA for studies 
111-202 and 111-205, and ECLA for studies 111-206, 111-301, and 111-302. Therefore, two different 
residual errors were estimated. PK data were fit using a log transform both sides approach with an 
additive error model. 
Model development revealed that vosoritide PK was best described by a 1-compartment model with 
first order absorption and first order elimination, when administered by the subcutaneous route. A 
time-dependent change-point for the absorption rate constant was estimated, a fast absorption phase 
was followed by a slower absorption. 
Methodology of model development was appropriate; estimation of PK parameters was precise (except 
for effect of WT on CL/F SE 25.1); goodness-of-fit plots did not reveal any model-misspecification. 
Overall, VPCs showed that concentrations were adequately predicted. 
For the final model sex, race, age, location of injection, ADA status and NAB status were tested as 
covariates, but were not significant within the respective dataset. Evaluation of possible simpler models 
was provided. The applicant justified the high unexplained variability with the low bioavailability (1.23 
% at 20 µg/kg) of vosoritide and the comparably higher residual error for the ELISA compared to the 
ECLA. 
The applicant argues that no maturation factor is needed because body size fully accounts for 
clearance differences even in younger children. This is acceptable for children > 2 years, for younger 
children this should be substantiated that renal function and enzyme function is described adequately 
with a weight function. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 89/191 
 
 
 
A covariate effect of time on bioavailability was used to describe the increasing plasma concentrations 
occurring during long-term treatment. Vosoritide clearance in children was not sufficiently described in 
children not by allometry, even with a time effect on bioavailability. The underlying confounding effect 
of weight on clearance was addressed in the proposed weight band posology. 
In the PPK-Model, an allometric coefficient was used. Consequently, for dosing allometric scaling is as 
well considered appropriate. Increased weight and dose of patients (and decreasing clearance per 
bodyweight) over time during the studies could rather be an explanation for higher plasma 
concentrations over time. 
To address the need for a lower per kilogram dose for older patients (higher bodyweight) and for a 
higher per kilogram dose for younger patients (lower bodyweight) a Weight-band based posology was 
proposed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
PD properties of vosoritide were assessed in 3 in vitro studies performed using human biomaterials 
(BMN111-18-101, BMN111-18-093, and BMN111-18-102) and in 7 clinical studies (111-101, 111-202, 
111-205, 111-206, 111-208, 111-301 and 111-302). The in vitro studies are discussed in pre-clinical 
section.  
Only limited data are available from study 111-206 that is still ongoing and targets investigation of 
vosoritide treatment in younger ACH population of age below 5 years. PK/PD data from study 111-
208 were not available at the time of this MAA, and are thus not included in the application. 
Various biomarkers including cGMP, collagen X biomarker (CXM), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BSAP), N-terminal pro-peptide of pro-collagen I (PINP), cross-linked C- terminal telopeptides of type 
II collagen (CTXII), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and N- terminal pro-peptide of CNP (NT-proCNP) 
were assessed. However, cGMP and CXM, were evaluated in more detail across the studies, as these 
parameters were considered the most reliable and sensitive. Annualised growth velocity (AGV) was 
also utilised as additional PD and efficacy parameter.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In study 111-101 (healthy volunteers) dose-dependent increases in plasma cGMP (mean values) 
were observed following both single (2.5 – 15 µg/kg) and multiple daily doses of vosoritide (up-to 10 
days only for 2.5 and 5 µg/kg doses). No effects on cGMP were observed on placebo. There was no 
correlation with the ANP or NTproCNP levels. 
In study 111-202 (≥5 years old children with ACH), similarly dose-dependent increases (at dose 
levels of 2.5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 30 µg/kg) were observed in urine cGMP/Cr and serum CXM, which were 
sustained over 2-year treatment period for 15 and 30 µg/kg (lower dose levels were not evaluated). 
However, CXM increase plateaued at the 15 and 30 μg/kg doses. There was no correlation between the 
plasma exposure of BMN111 and serum BSAP levels. 
AGV estimated after 6 months of vosoritide treatment showed similar differences as CXM with more 
pronounced changes on higher doses of 15 and 30 µg/kg vosoritide, when compared to the lower dose 
groups.  
In study 111-205, similar trends in changes of the key PD parameters were maintained as in study 
111-202.  
Study 111-301 tested PD effects of the single proposed therapeutic dose of 15 µg/kg vosoritide 
against placebo in ACH children aged 5 to < 18 years.  
The PD marker analysis showed an increase in urine cGMP after vosoritide treatment compared to 
placebo that was sustained over 52 weeks. However, the results for the PD marker BSAP were 
inconclusive. Although there seemed to be a slight increase at certain time-points with vosoritide 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 92/191 
 
 
 
treatment compared to placebo, the data were highly variable. On the other hand, there was also an 
increase in the PD marker CXM with vosoritide treatment over the 52 weeks period. 
Data from study 111-302, an ongoing extension study to 111-301, are limited, but similar to those 
from study 111-301. 
Limited data were submitted from study 111-206, which is an ongoing study in infants and younger 
children (max. age of 5 years). At the time of data cut-off, PD information (plasma cGMP and serum 
CXM) in 4 sentinel subjects and 33 randomised subjects (aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months) receiving 30 
μg/kg vosoritide was available.  
Increases in post-dose plasma cGMP concentrations were observed, which remained constant over the 
time period of 52 weeks and were similar to the changes observed in older age group. CXM (mean and 
median) on vosoritide was increased in serum throughout the study (over up-to 39 weeks) compared 
to baseline and placebo. However, values overlapped considerably between vosoritide and placebo. 
High variability was noted in the measured parameters.  
An updated blinded analysis in Cohort 1 subjects (19 vosoritide-treated subjects and 16 placebo-
treated subjects aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months) showed that levels in serum CXM (averaged across all 
visits and per treatment) were roughly similar to those observed in older children (i.e. study 111-301) 
for the respective treatment. High variability in CXM values are noted.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Evaluations including exposure-response relationship for safety relevant parameters, such as HR, BP 
(systolic and diastolic) suggest a potential weak correlation between BMN111 exposure and increase in 
HR with a shallow, but significant (p < 0.05), positive slope, in subjects given daily doses between 2.5 
μg/kg and 30 μg/kg. No significant correlations between BMN111 plasma exposure and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (as measured in sitting position) was detected.  
Regarding possible off-target effects of vosoritide on diuresis, in study 111-301 no effects on fluid or 
electrolyte balance were seen. No apparent clinical effects have been observed to suggest modulation 
of blood-brain barrier permeability. 
Impact on QT interval/ECG parameters 
A dedicated thorough QT study with vosoritide was not conducted. 
The hERG-cell-based assay (BMN111-11-023) did not detect any inhibition of hERG using up to 13.4 
μM vosoritide (50 μg/mL). Non-clinical in vivo studies also did not reveal any relevant findings which 
would raise safety concerns. Non-clinical data is presented in Sections 2.3.2. and 2.3.6. of this 
assessment report. 
In study 111-101, the PD markers cGMP, ANP and NT-proCNP were evaluated. While there was a 
dose-dependent increase of cGMP levels both in the plasma and urine of the subjects, there was no 
correlation with the ANP or NTproCNP levels. 
Analysis of the ECGs in study 111-301 study showed, that in the by-visit analysis using statistical 
modelling, mean change-from baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) was larger in the vosoritide group than in the 
placebo group and the maximum mean ΔΔQTcF of 5.4 ms (90% UCI 8.5 ms) was reported.  
The relationship between the individually observed vosoritide plasma concentrations and estimated 
placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF (i.e., ΔΔQTcF) showed that the 90% CI widened with increased 
concentrations, but the 90% upper confidence bound of the estimated ΔΔQTcF remained below 10 ms. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 93/191 
 
 
 
The estimated slope of vosoritide plasma concentration in the concentration-QTc relationship was 
positive and not statistically significant. The effect on ΔΔQTcF was predicted to be 3.7 ms (90% CI: 
1.41 to 6.03) for 15 μg/kg vosoritide.  
Categorical analysis (pooled patient population) detected 7 patients with increased QTcF by >30 msec 
<60 msec on vosoritide and 3 on placebo. None of the cases had QTcF > 450 msec. Increases in QTcF 
were episodic. Majority of the patients had non-baseline pre-treatment values of QTcF, which were 
higher than the baseline and closer to the on-treatment peak QTcFs. High intra-subject variability in 
QTcF was observed in part of the patients. 
PD interactions with other medicinal products 
No clinical PD interaction studies were conducted. 
Exposure-response analyses 
The relationship between dose and improvement in AGV was assessed across Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies. In study 111-202, vosoritide was administered in ACH subjects aged 5 to 14 years in daily 
doses ranging from 2.5 μg/kg to 30 μg/kg. At 6 months, a positive dose-dependent response in AGV 
was observed from 2.5 up to 15 μg/kg daily, which reached plateau at the 15 μg/kg and 30 μg/kg 
doses (Cohorts 3 and 4) with no clinically significant difference in mean change from baseline AGV 
between these two cohorts. After 6 months, when Cohorts 1 and 2 subjects were dose titrated from 
2.5 and 7.5 μg/kg, respectively, to the 15 μg/kg daily dosing, an improvement in baseline AGV was 
observed similar to that seen in Cohorts 3 and 4, persisting through the 24-month duration of the trial. 
In the ongoing extension study 111-205, Cohorts 3 and 4 had similar improvement in AGV up to 48 
months (the longest duration available). 
The relationships between vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in activity biomarker cGMP and 
bone metabolism biomarkers CXM have been evaluated in ACH subjects across different clinical studies 
and consistent exposure-response relationships were observed. Furthermore, the relationship between 
vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in AGV from baseline had been analysed in Phase 2 and Phase 
3 studies. Overall, the exposure response analyses consistently show that changes in AGV from 
baseline have reached the plateau of the exposure-response curve at exposures obtained at 15 μg/kg 
and there are no additional meaningful improvements in AGV at 30 μg/kg compared to 15 μg/kg. 
The exposure-response relationship between CXM and the investigated exposure metrics for vosoritide 
(AUC0-∞, AUC0-60min and Cmax) showed flat exposure-response curves for study 111-206 (2 - <5 
years old) as well as for study 111-301 (>5 years old).  
Effects of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on PD 
Effects of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on PD were not investigated in dedicated analyses due to the high 
variability observed in PD.  
However, with respect to efficacy parameters, effects of sex, age group, Tanner stage, strata, baseline 
height Z-score, and baseline AGV on efficacy of vosoritide were studied in Study 111-301.  
Analysis of AGV by baseline age group (>= 5 to < 8 years, >= 8 to < 11 years, >= 11 to < 15 years) 
did not show any apparent differences on treatment with vosoritide at week 52. 
Analysis of AGV by baseline Tanner stage (I vs >I), and baseline AGV category (<= 3.5 cm/yr, > 3.5 
to <= 4.5 cm/yr, > 4.5 cm/yr) suggest that the patients with younger age (i.e. 5-8 y/o), with Tanner 
stage I, and lower baseline AGV (<= 3.5 cm/yr and > 3.5 to <= 4.5 cm/yr) benefited from vosoritide 
treatment the most. The patients with baseline AGV of > 4.5 cm/yr (N=27 at week 52 of the 
treatment) did not seem to have any improvement in baseline AGV at all. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 94/191 
 
 
 
In the subgroup analysis by baseline z-score for height (<= -6, > -6 to <= -5, > -5 to <= -4, > -4), 
lowest change in AGV was observed in the subgroup with baseline z-score of <= -6. The remaining 
subgroups did not differ considerably in respect to the AGV. However, sample size of the subgroups 
was very small and the conclusions are difficult to draw on potential impact of baseline z-score for 
height on efficacy of vosoritide. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has presented a limited investigation on clinical pharmacokinetics partly owing to the 
nature of the compound (being a protein), the orphan nature of the disease to be treated, and the 
difficulties in investigating PK in healthy subjects, with hypotensive effects preventing the 
administration of higher doses. This is acknowledged by the CHMP. 
The absolute bioavailability of vosoritide is unknown, as only the SC route was investigated in the 
clinical studies. While basic parameters of PK (absorption, distribution etc.) have been adequately 
investigated, several aspects of PK investigations and characterisations have been omitted or are 
partly deficient. The compound has been found to be non-proportional with increased plasma levels at 
higher doses. Demographic factors appear to play a role with regard to age and weight, however, this 
is thought to be attributable to weight only, which is likely to also explain the time-related effect of 
increase bioavailability over time (in long-term observation).  
Only minor changes to formulation were made during the development, therefore no relevant changes 
in bioavailability are expected, and no comparison between formulations has been conducted. This is 
agreed by the CHMP. The interchangeability of administration sites has only partly been investigated, 
but no relevant differences were detected, and the proposed alteration of administration sites was also 
mirrored in the development programme, the CHMP therefore considers that no clinically relevant 
deviation is expected and the proposed dosing/administration site is agreed.  
With regard to interactions, the potential for cytochrome - as well as transporter - based interactions 
has been excluded based on in vitro investigations. In addition, theoretical considerations on 
metabolism were provided since, as a small peptide, vosoritide is expected to be cleared primarily by 
protease-mediated catabolism, receptor mediated clearance via NPR-C and renal elimination. Due to 
the nature of the compound and its rapid clearance, it is agreed by the CHMP that no further 
investigations are carried out with regard to identification of further degradants/metabolites and their 
PD activity. 
The applicant was requested to justify why vosoritide has a prolonged half-life in comparison to 
endogenous CNP. The applicant clarified that endogenous CNP has a short half-life of 2.6 minutes in 
humans (Potter, 2011: 2.6 minutes, Lorget, 2012: 2 minutes). The structural modification of vosoritide 
confers resistance to proteolysis by neutral endopeptidase (Wendt, 2015) such that its half-life is 
extended almost 10-fold (mean t1/2 of 27.9 minutes at Week 52 of study 111-301) in comparison to 
endogenous CNP. Furthermore, the applicant explained that the longer half-life observed during the 
trials in healthy volunteers might be explainable by the higher body weight of the healthy adult 
volunteers compared to the paediatric ACH patients. The increased total dose administered to adult 
healthy volunteers might have saturated clearance and prolonged the elimination half-life. This is 
accepted by the CHMP. 
Antibody formation (although overall frequent; see below) has not shown to have an influence on PK.  
The compound is intended for the use in children and adolescents only, and hence, no data on adults 
and elderly patients are available which is acceptable to the CHMP. The data available for young 
children proposed for treatment between 2 and 5 years of age have been updated from the available 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

results of study 206 and are considered sufficient to be included in the posology. The proposed weight 
bands are finally considered acceptable.  
The MAH was requested to revise the proposed posology since it was regarded to give an overall 
higher exposure, as well as higher dosing outside an acceptable range around 15 µg/kg at least for 
most of the smaller children (lower weight bands). The applicant has revised the proposed posology 
(Table 27). The simpler posology which provides advantages for application in children is 
acknowledged by the CHMP. The concern of higher exposure is alleviated with the revised proposal, 
which proposes a weight band dosing which does not include the 15 µg/kg, namely with a 22-24 µg/kg 
and a 18-23 µg/kg dose, only for those children of 10-11 and 12-16 kg body weight, respectively. 
However, since most of the children reaching the age of 2 fall in a weight above the two lowest bands 
and considering the background of higher clearance (per kg bodyweight), the dosing in the children 
under the lowest weight bands is agreed by the CHMP. The remaining theoretical safety concerns 
based on the relatively high doses used in the smallest children will be addressed with the provision of 
final data of the study 111-206 which is imposed as a condition to the marketing authorisation. The 
revised posology which addressed the nonlinear effect of weight on clearance is endorsed by the 
CHMP.No studies have been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and this is agreed 
by the CHMP based on the nature of the compound and the fact that patients in the intended indication 
(and age) will rarely suffer from impairment of renal or hepatic function. The missing of data is 
adequately reflected in section 4.2. the SmPC.  
PD and exposure-response analyses 
There were no designated PD studies, but PD markers were assessed as secondary and exploratory 
endpoints in the clinical studies. This is acceptable to the CHMP.  
To test PD effects of vosoritide cGMP (as measured in plasma and urine normalised to creatinine) and 
CXM (measured in serum) were selected as key biomarkers. Additionally, a clinical PD/efficacy 
parameter – annualised growth velocity (AGV) was evaluated.   
Based on the mechanism of action of vosoritide, the selected 2 biomarkers for PD/primary 
pharmacology analysis appear scientifically justified, as cGMP reflects activation of the target receptor 
(NPR-B) of vosoritide in the target (growth plate/bones) and off-target (e.g. vasculature) tissues, and 
as CXM is thought to reflect endochondral ossification/bone growth (Coghlan et al., 2017). The AGV 
parameter is broadly acknowledged and clinically relevant as it directly measures effects of vosoritide 
on growth; AGV was the key efficacy clinical parameter in all vosoritide studies in ACH patients. 
No background information on e.g., validation in monitoring of treatment effects, clinically relevant 
changes, etc. was submitted on cGMP and CXM, neither it seems that such data are available. 
However, given that clinically relevant and reliable efficacy parameter - AGV - was also used as a PD 
parameter, this parameter can be utilised as a reference, and lack of biomarker validation and 
respective uncertainties are regarded not critical.   
There were additional biomarkers analysed in the clinical data package, which showed inconsistent 
results. The controversial findings were explained by limited sensitivity of some markers to detect 
small changes in growth that occur over a short time frame.   
Descriptive analysis of cGMP over the dose range of 2.5 to 30 µg/kg vosoritide suggests that the 
interaction between vosoritide and NPR-B receptors in various tissues takes place quickly after the 
substance becomes systemically available, is dose-dependent, and sustained during repeated use 
throughout the 2-year treatment, suggesting rapid and durable drug activity at receptors. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 96/191 
 
 
 
 
Serum CXM and AGV showed a dose-dependent increase, that plateaued at 15 and 30 μg/kg doses 
suggesting saturation of vosoritide effects at 15 μg/kg. These data support the assumed mechanism of 
action of vosoritide, suggesting that vosoritide affects bone growth. Further, while, additional 
activation of NPR-B receptors seem to be achieved with 30 µg/kg vosoritide (as indicated by cGMP) no 
additional PD effects on bone (as indicated by CXM and AGV) were achieved with this dose. This 
suggests that greater systemic pharmacological activity of vosoritide at this dose does not translate 
solely into the effects on the on-target tissue.  
Model-based exposure-response analyses showed PK/PD dependencies which were consistent with the 
descriptive PD analysis. All 3 PD parameters showed correlation between the exposures and effects at 
the dose levels up-to 15 µg/kg. But no correlations were noted at 15 and 30 µg/kg dose levels, that 
supports the assumption, that there is a saturation of PD effects 15 µg/kg dose.  
An Emax-Model with hill coefficient was used to describe the relationship between Cmax or AUC vs. 
different PD endpoints (cGMP, CXM, AGV). Estimated values for E0, EC50 and Emax had broad 
confidence intervals and include highly negative values for the E0-Plateau, which can hardly be 
explained physiologically and questions the validity of the estimated EC50 values. However, since 
consistent dose- and exposure-dependent changes were observed across various PD parameters 
(biomarkers, i.e., cGMP, CXM and clinical parameter - AGV) and across the studies, the observed 
findings are considered reliable and support the use of 15 µg/kg dose of vosoritide in the ACH 
population ≥ 5 years old. 
In patients 2-<5 years of age only very limited data have been submitted due to the fact, that the 
study is still ongoing and blinded. Study or age-related differences (2-<5 years olds vs. older age 
groups) regarding the exposure-response relationship could neither be determined nor excluded based 
on the presented data. 
Limited PD data in 2-<5-year-olds and their comparison to older patients suggest that PD effects of 
vosoritide are similar across various age groups.  
The applicant has not conducted dedicated secondary pharmacology studies, however, evaluations 
including exposure-response relationship for safety relevant parameters, such as HR, BP, hypotension 
and injection site reactions were conducted and showed no or weak correlation with vosoritide 
exposure. In study 111-301, no effects on fluid or electrolyte balance were seen and there are also 
no effects indicating a modulation of the blood-brain barrier permeability. 
In the study 111-101 conducted in healthy volunteers, there was a dose-dependent increase of cGMP 
levels (indicating binding of BMN111 to NPR-B) both in the plasma and urine of the subjects. However, 
there was no correlation with the ANP (biomarker of natriuretic peptide homeostasis) or NTproCNP 
(marker for CNP biosynthesis) levels. The results suggest activity of the target receptor, while the 
endogenous CNP production does not seem to be influenced. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Thorough QT study was not conducted. Non-clinical data on vosoritide did not suggest clinically 
relevant effects on cardiac repolarisation/length of QT. As to the clinical data, the applicant analysed 
ECGs in the patients with ACH on the exposures corresponding to a single therapeutic dose of 15 µg/kg 
in the pivotal study 111-301 and its open-label extension study 111-302. Cases of QTcF 
prolongation (by >30 and < 60 msec) were reported on treatment with vosoritide. However, these 
changes were episodic/transient, not associated with a cardiac AE, and are assumed not to be drug-
related.  Vosoritide is a peptide analogue of an endogenous substance and, thus, less likely to have 
any impact on QT. Overall, based on the data available, there are no concerns raised in regard to 
potential effects of vosoritide on QT.   
The applicant did not provide clinical data on drug-drug interactions. This is acceptable to the CHMP, 
since as discussed in the non-clinical Section 2.3.6. of the assessment report, the only approved 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 97/191 
 
 
 
medicines with potential drug-drug interactions are not expected to be used in children. Furthermore, 
the in vitro investigations did not indicate potential influence on cytochromes or on transporter-based 
interactions.  
Effects of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on PD were assessed as subgroup analyses (sex, age group, Tanner 
stage, strata, baseline height Z-score, and baseline AGV) in study 111-301. The results from the 
subgroup were overall consistent with the main analysis. It was noted that the lowest change in AGV 
was observed in the subgroup with baseline z-score of <= -6; however, no conclusions could be drawn 
due to the limited sample size. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The information on vosoritide pharmacokinetics is overall sufficient. The posology is agreed by the 
CHMP. There are remaining theoretical safety concerns based on the relatively high doses used in the 
smallest children that will be addressed with the provision of final data of the study 111-206 which is 
imposed as a condition to the marketing authorisation. The dosing recommendations, especially with 
regard to the proposed weight bands, may be re-discussed when the PASS results are available. 
The presented data package for testing of PD and PK/PD is overall acceptable and is considered 
supportive for the targeted indication and therapeutic approach. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Four different types of comparative controls were used to support the assessment of efficacy 
in this application: 
•  Placebo – inherent with the study design of study 111-301 including 60 subjects randomised 
to the vosoritide arm and 61 subjects randomised to the placebo arm; 
•  Observational/placebo – established by extending the 52-week follow-up placebo arm in 
study 111-301 to include ≥6 months of pretreatment growth data from study 111-901;  
•  External control – subjects from the NH sources (primarily AchNH and supported by pooled 
111-901, LIAISE and KAISER) were matched to the vosoritide subjects by sex and integer age 
at the time of the height assessment; this matching process resulted in a one to many 
matching with a different number of NH subjects matched to each vosoritide subject;  
• 
Intra-subject (baseline) control – inherent with the designs of the Phase 2 and 3 studies 
assessing intra-subject comparisons of change from baseline for each variable every 6 months, 
whereby pretreatment growth data were collected in 111-901 for baseline AGV calculations 
(the number of subjects per treatment arm are presented for each individual study. The Phase 
2 and 3 studies also allowed evaluation of changes in AGV prior to, and then after, either dose 
increases (111-202), or switching from placebo to active vosoritide (111-302). 
• 
The applicant conducted also Study 111-206 and the extension Study 111-208 in patients 0 
to 60 months, similarly designed as those for the older age cohort (111-301 and 302) 
described above.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study 111-202 
Study 111-202 was a paediatric, Phase 2, open-label dose-escalation study to assess the safety and 
tolerability of daily BMN111 administered to 35 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of ACH. Subjects who 
were 5 to 14 years of age inclusive, with documented ACH confirmed by genetic testing, had at least a 
6-month period of pretreatment growth assessment in study 111-901 immediately before study entry, 
and who met the study eligibility criteria were selected to participate in this study. BMN111 was to be 
administered SC once daily provided none of the protocol-defined stopping or safety criteria occurred. 
On days of scheduled clinic visits, BMN111 administration was to be performed in the clinic relative to 
the scheduled assessments and procedures defined in the Schedule of Events. Subjects were to 
participate in the study as shown in Figure 23. 
Figure 23: Flow of participants in study 111-202 
During the study, subjects received BMN111 in one of the following daily dosing regimens: 
Cohort 1: daily morning dose 2.5 μg/kg 
Cohort 2: daily morning dose 7.5 μg/kg 
Cohort 3: daily morning dose 15.0 μg/kg 
Cohort 4: daily morning dose 30.0 μg/kg 
Initial treatment duration was 6 months with an optional 18-months extension study. 
Efficacy Summary on dose finding from study 111-202  
Initial 6-month Treatment Period 
At 6 months, an increase in AGV was observed with BMN111 at 7.5, 15 and 30 μg/kg. The changes in 
AGV were dose dependent and achieved a plateau with 15 μg/kg. There was no additional benefit in 
effect on AGV seen with 30 μg/kg daily dose compared with 15 μg/kg. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 99/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent dose-dependent increases of post-dose urine cGMP/Cr concentrations at 7.5 to 30 μg/kg 
BMN111 demonstrate systemic ligation of target NPR-B receptors and downstream systemic 
pharmacological activity that is durable over 24 months. The analysis of correlation between plasma PK 
and urine cGMP suggests that at 30 μg/kg, BMN111 activity as assessed by urine cGMP is near 
maximal or saturated). Based on the dose-dependent increase in AGV with 2.5 µ/kg, 7.5 µg/kg and 15 
µg/kg doses, after 6-months, subjects initially treated with 2.5 µg/kg (Cohort 1) and 7.5 µg/kg (Cohort 
2) were dose titrated to 15 µg/kg. Subjects on 15 µg/kg (Cohort 3) or 30 µg/kg (Cohort 4) remained 
on their initial doses. 
Sustained dose-dependent increases in pre-dose CXM biomarker concentrations up to 15 μg/kg 
BMN111 suggest durable dose-dependent increases in endochondral bone formation up to 15 μg/kg 
BMN111. No additional CXM response was observed at 30 μg/kg BMN111, suggesting increased 
pharmacological activity at 30 μg/kg BMN111 indicated by post-dose urine cGMP changes was not in 
the target tissue and/or did not result in additional endochondral bone formation. 
Together, AGV, cGMP, and CXM data support selection of the 15 μg/kg dose as the minimum dose that 
yields maximum on-target activity and subsequent potential treatment benefit.  
Long-term Treatment Period (6-month Initial +18-month Extension) 
The level of increase in AGV observed in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) and Cohort 4 (30 μg/kg) was 
maintained over a long-term treatment period, up to 24 months after the initiation of BMN111. There 
was no improvement in AGV with the 30 μg/kg dose versus the 15 μg/kg dose over the long-term 
period. At the 15 μg/kg dose, the mean AGV was maintained at approximately 6 cm/yr identical to the 
mean yearly growth velocity for US children for the age group recruited. This increase was maintained 
from 6 months to the end of the 24-month treatment period, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis. 
Consistent with the observation of increase in AGV, a persistent improvement in height Z-scores was 
observed over the 2-year duration of the study, with an overall 0.88 SDS scores increase in height, 
suggesting an increase in linear growth compared with the matched non-ACH general population. 
There was no evidence of worsening in body proportion ratios, implying proportional growth effect of 
BMN111 across upper and lower body segments and upper and lower limb segments. There was very 
small but statistically significant decrease in the upper to lower body segment ratio over the 2-year 
duration of the trial.  
X-ray of the left hand to evaluate potential anatomic abnormalities and to evaluate the progression of 
skeletal development revealed no abnormal acceleration of skeletal maturity.  
The mean maximum increase in urine cGMP was dose-dependent and sustained over 24 months of 
daily SC dosing. The analysis of plasma PK and urine cGMP over the 2-year duration of the study 
suggests that at 30 μg/kg, BMN111 activity as assessed by urine cGMP is near maximal or saturated. 
There was no significant correlation between BMN111 plasma exposure and mean CXM through 24-
months of daily dosing across the plasma exposure range with daily doses between 15 μg/kg and 30 
μg/kg, suggesting the exposures obtained at these dose levels yield a maximal response. 
Once daily administration-justification: 
The once-daily regimen was selected because it was expected to yield a maximal treatment effect 
based on nonclinical evidence. In the ACH mouse model, once-daily dosing with vosoritide was 
sufficient to restore growth in ACH mice to the levels achieved in wild type mice. Furthermore, in vitro 
studies demonstrated a once-daily regimen resulted in a similar extent of chondrocyte proliferation 
relative to twice daily or continuous exposure. This finding is consistent with evidence that suggests 
the target receptor (NPR-B) undergoes transient desensitisation following prolonged activation (Potter 
2009).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy analyses in this application focused on subjects who received an intended therapeutic daily 
dose of vosoritide 15 μg/kg. Pre-treatment growth measures collected in observational study 111-901 
were used to calculate baseline AGV in studies 111-202, 111-206 and 111-301 (pivotal study).

Methods 
Study 111-301 
The completed multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (111-301) 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks of treatment with vosoritide (15 μg/kg daily) compared 
with placebo in children aged 5 to <18 years with a clinical diagnosis of ACH confirmed by genetic 
testing. 
Randomisation was stratified by sex and Tanner stage (Tanner stage 1, or Tanner stage >1), with no 
more than 20% of Tanner stage>1 to be enrolled. A total of 121 subjects were enrolled into the study; 
61 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and 60 subjects to receive daily vosoritide 15 μg/kg.

After 52 weeks of treatment, all 61 subjects in the placebo group completed the study and in the 
vosoritide group, 58 subjects completed and 2 subjects withdrew from the study (1 subject 
discontinued study due to an AE [anxiety about injections] and 1 subject discontinued study due to 
subject request [subject was experiencing pain during injections]). Figure 25 provides an overview 
about the study design:

detect a difference of 1.75 cm/year between the vosoritide group and the placebo group in change 
from baseline in AGV at 12 months was approximately 90%, assuming the pooled standard deviation 
(SD) of the change from baseline in AGV is 2.80, using a two-sided two-sample t-test at the 0.05 
significance level. The power calculation was based on data from study 111-202 (a Phase 2, open-
label, sequential cohort dose-escalation study of vosoritide in children with ACH) and 111-901. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to vosoritide 15 μg/kg or placebo, using an interactive voice/web 
response (IXRS) system. In the original protocol, the randomisation was stratified by sex and age (< 
11, ≥ 11 years). In Amendment 2 (dated 27 April 2017), the randomisation was updated and stratified 
(4 strata) by Tanner stage (Stage I or Stage > I, with no greater than 20% of subjects Stage > I) and 
sex (50% of each sex was to be enrolled, with neither to exceed 55%). Two subjects were enrolled 
according to the strata in the original study protocol.

Blinding (masking) 
Vosoritide and placebo were packaged and labelled in the same way, with the study number and a 
unique identification number. Vosoritide placebo was designed to be comparable in appearance to 
vosoritide, was reconstituted in the same way, and contained all of the components of the drug 
product (except vosoritide) including commercially sourced sterile WFI. An independent third-party 
vendor developed the randomisation schedule so that BioMarin and site personnel did not know the 
treatment assignment. Subjects and the participating site members were blinded to study treatment. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all randomised 
subjects. The Per-Protocol (PP) population was determined consistent with the ICH E9 Guideline and 
was defined as a subset of the FAS population who were compliant with the protocol. Safety analyses 
were performed on the Safety Population, defined as a subset of the FAS who received at least one 
dose of double-blinded vosoritide or placebo. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to determine the treatment difference between 
vosoritide and placebo at 52 weeks. Unless otherwise specified, all models included the following 
baseline covariates: Treatment group, Stratum (Male Tanner Stage I, Female Tanner Stage I, Male 
Tanner Stage > I, Female Tanner Stage > I), age at baseline, AGV at baseline, Height Z-score at 
baseline. 
The following primary hypothesis was tested (two-tailed): 
H0: Difference in mean AGV change from baseline at Week 52 between vosoritide group and the 
placebo group = 0 
Ha: Difference in mean AGV change from baseline at Week 52 between vosoritide group and the 
placebo group ≠ 0 
The study was considered positive if the two-sided p-value in favour of vosoritide was < 0.05. 
Results of the statistical analyses were provided in separate tables, including the least-squares (LS) 
mean change from baseline at Week 52 for each treatment group, the treatment difference in LS 
means (calculated as vosoritide – Placebo), the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment 
difference, and corresponding 2-sided p-value. 
Height Z-score and upper to lower body segment ratio were analysed using the same methods and 
estimand formulation as the primary analysis. 
The overall type I family-wise error rate for testing the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
was controlled at the two-sided 0.05 significance level using a 3-step serial gatekeeping multiple 
comparison procedure (MCP). Following this MCP, advancement to the next step occurred only if the 
null hypotheses within a step and the previous step(s) were all rejected at the significance level of 0.05 
in favour of vosoritide. 
Subjects who discontinued from study drug were encouraged to remain in the study and their non-
missing height measurements were then used in calculating their AGV. In the event that missing data 
did occur despite all efforts, the missing standing heights were imputed. 
The proposal was to apply multiple imputation (MI) techniques with pattern-mixture models. In order 
to apply this method, each imputation required at least 5 subjects in the same treatment group who 
also discontinued treatment prematurely at a similar time point and had standing height assessments 
post treatment discontinuation. In the situation where insufficient data from patients discontinuing 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 107/191 
 
 
 
treatment but not study was available, an alternative imputation technique was proposed in the SAP, 
whereby the missing standing height values at Week 52 (ie, Day 365) were imputed by applying the 
baseline AGV (cm/year) to the last available height assessment. This method was applied. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition is presented in Figure 27 and Table 30. A total of 121 subjects were enrolled into 
the study; 61 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and 60 subjects to receive vosoritide 15 
μg/kg. After 52 weeks of treatment, all 61 subjects in the placebo group completed the study and in 
the vosoritide group, 58 subjects completed and 2 subjects withdrew from the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
a.)  Primary Endpoint: Change from Baseline in AGV at Week 52 (ANCOVA Model) – Full 
Analysis Set in Pivotal trial 111-301 
The primary efficacy variable in study 111-301 was the annualised growth velocity which is a key 
indicator of skeletal growth; well-documented over the paediatric age range; highly sensitive to factors 
that impact growth negatively or positively; and easily and objectively measurable in an accurate non-
invasive manner.

represent outliers. AGV at a Post-baseline Visit is defined as [(Height at Post-baseline Visit - Height at 
Baseline)/(Date of Post-baseline Visit - Date of Baseline Assessment)] x 365.25.  
In the PP population, the results were similar to the FAS ANCOVA analysis with a LS mean change 
from baseline of 0.22 cm/year (95% CI: −0.16, 0.59) in the placebo group and 1.80 cm/year (95% 
CI: 1.45, 2.16) in the vosoritide group.  
The difference in LS mean change from baseline was statistically significant in favor of vosoritide (1.58, 
95% CI: 1.22, 1.95; p<0.0001). The difference in effect on AGV between placebo and vosoritide was 
observed already at Week 26 and was maintained to Week 52.  
b.)  Key secondary outcome: Change from Baseline in Height Z-score at Week 52 (ANCOVA 
Model) – Full Analysis Set in study 111-301 
The key secondary efficacy variable in Study 111-301 was height Z-score. Data are presented as SDS 
above or below the age-specific reference (equivalent to 0) for average stature children calculated 
using CDC or WHO, as applicable.

c.)  Key secondary outcome: Upper to Lower Body Segment Ratio 
A key secondary efficacy variable in Study 111-301 was the upper to lower body segment ratio. This 
is an indicator of changes to body proportionality, whereby ratio falls to 1 by approximately 10 years of 
age in average stature children and never reaches 1 in untreated children with ACH.

LS means and difference in LS means were obtained from an analysis of covariance model. Model terms included 
stratum defined by sex and Tanner stage, treatment, baseline age, baseline AGV, baseline height Z-score and 
baseline upper to lower body segment ratio. 
The LS mean change from baseline to Week 52 in upper to lower body segment ratio was −0.02 (95% 
CI: −0.05, 0.01) in the placebo group and −0.03 (95% CI: −0.06, 0.00) in the vosoritide group. The 
difference in LS mean change from baseline was −0.01 (95% CI: −0.05, 0.02; p<0.5060) indicating 
that there was no evidence of a difference between treatment groups.  
In the PP population, the results were similar to the FAS ANCOVA analysis, with a LS mean change 
from baseline of −0.03 (95% CI: −0.07, 0.01) in the placebo group and −0.04 (95% CI: −0.07, 
−0.01) in the vosoritide group. Again there was no evidence of a difference between treatment groups 
in LS mean change from baseline was not statistically significant (−0.01, 95% CI: −0.05, 0.02; 
p<0.5291). 
d.) Secondary Outcome: Standing Height 
Standing  height  was  a  secondary  endpoint.  A  positive,  consistent  and  durable  effect  on  AGV  will 
ultimately result in a meaningful incremental increase in standing height, standing height was thus used 
to quantify treatment benefit on growth over the long-term period. 
The results of the ANCOVA model analysis of change from baseline in standing height at Week 52 is 
presented in Table 38.

Model terms included stratum defined by sex and Tanner stage, treatment, baseline age, baseline AGV, baseline 
height Z-score and baseline standing height. 
Missing assessments at Week 52 were imputed as described in the SAP.  
Spaghetti plots of individual standing height data plotted over time by treatment group and sex for 
average stature age-sex-specific reference data and ACH reference age-sex specific reference data 
from Hoover-Fong 2017 were shown in addition regarding this outcome, which indicate that growth for 
the majority of subjects prior to treatment was according to expected growth for untreated ACH. Post-
baseline height trajectories show an incline for the vosoritide group compared to placebo subjects 
whose growth tracks continues to track according to children with untreated ACH. 
e.)  Secondary Endpoint outcomes on Quality of life and functional independence assessment 
in Study 111-301 
Activities of daily living and functional independence were assessed using the: 
•  Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM) instrument - an assessment 
tool that measures functional performance across three domains (self- care, mobility and 
cognition) assessed by the clinician, and with input from the parent/caregiver  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 119/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The WeeFIM instrument measures functional performance across 3 domains from the 
parent/caregiver’s perspective (self-care [score range 8 to 56], mobility [score range 8 to 35], and 
cognition [score range 8 to 35]) and provides a total score between 18 and 126. Higher scores reflect 
greater functional independence in self-care, mobility, and social cognitive skills (WeeFIM Clinical Guide 
v6.0 2006). At Week 52, no difference was observed in change from baseline between the vosoritide 
and placebo groups in any of the domains. 
•  The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0-generic score scales - a generic 
tool to measure HRQoL in children and adolescents (child self-report and parent-report 
versions) consisting of questions across four domains 
•  Median change from baseline to Week 52 for PedsQL score (caregiver and self-reported) at 
Week 52 shows no difference in change from baseline between the vosoritide and placebo 
groups in any of the PedsQL domains for caregiver or self-reported. The Quality of Life in 
Short Statured Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire – a disease-specific patient-reported 
outcome tool designed for short-stature youth (child self-report and parent report versions) 
consisting of questions across seven domains. 
At Week 52, no difference was observed in change from baseline between the vosoritide and placebo 
groups in any of the caregiver reported QoLISSY domains. 
Long term efficacy – available results from ongoing Study 111-302 
During the procedure, the applicant provided analyses of the ongoing extension study 111-302 
performed with a 02 November 2020 data cut-off to assess key efficacy endpoints, AGV, height Z-
score, standing height, and upper to lower body segment ratio. 
117 out of 121 subjects from Study 111-301 were continuing in Study 111-302. A total of 56 subjects 
had been treated for at least 2 years (initially randomised to vosoritide in 111-301), and 61 subjects 
had been treated with vosoritide for 1 year (initially randomised to placebo in 111-301). By the data 
cut-off date, 14 subjects completed 130-weeks on treatment with vosoritide, with 2 subjects reaching 
156 weeks and 1 subject reaching 182 weeks. 
In summary, the analyses of the 52-week data from Study 111-302 showed that the effect on growth, 
observed in the first 52 weeks of treatment with vosoritide in Study 111-301, is maintained in the 
second year of treatment. 
In subjects on continuous vosoritide treatment after 2 years, the improvement in AGV observed at 52 
weeks (mean AGV 5.67 cm/year) was maintained after 104 weeks (mean AGV 5.64 cm/year). The 
maintenance of positive effect on AGV resulted in a continuous improvement in height Z-score, with a 
change from baseline of +0.24 SDS after 52 weeks of treatment and to +0.45 SDS after 104 weeks of 
treatment. Improvement in the upper to lower body segment ratio was also observed, with a change 
from baseline of -0.03 after 52 weeks and -0.09 after 104 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the 
treatment effect continued to be maintained beyond 2 years as observed for 14 subjects with 130 
weeks on-treatment data with vosoritide. 
Efficacy of vosoritide was also confirmed in subjects with one year on-treatment data, after switching 
from placebo to vosoritide treatment in 111-302, who showed a similar improvement in growth 
velocity after switching from placebo compared to those originally randomised to vosoritide and treated 
for one year in 111-301.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 120/191 
 
 
 
 
 
In a comparative analyses of growth data from the first year versus the second year of treatment with 
vosoritide, there was no difference in the LS mean change from baseline in study 111-302 to Week 52 
for height, height Z-score, and upper to lower body segment ratio, demonstrating the treatment effect 
in Year 1 was maintained in Year 2.  
For the 24-month analyses, which compared the untreated versus treated subjects over a 2-year 
period, the results were consistent with the conclusion that the treatment effect was maintained in the 
second year. The LS mean difference for AGV in the second year of treatment was similar to the 
difference observed in the first year. For height Z-score, and upper to lower body segment ratio, the 
LS mean difference in Year 2 was approximately twice of that observed in Year 1. 
Ancillary analyses 
Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted whereby the ANCOVA model used in the primary 
analyses was applied to the following subgroups: sex, age group, Tanner stage, strata, baseline height 
Z-score, and baseline AGV. The difference between treatment group LS means within these subgroups 
(estimated as vosoritide − placebo), and the 95% CI for the treatment difference, at Week 52 are 
presented in Table 39. 
The benefit of improvement in AGV in favour of Voxzogo was consistent across all predefined 
subgroups analysed including sex, age group, Tanner stage, baseline height Z-score, and baseline 
AGV. In the subgroup of males Tanner Stage >I, the point estimate of treatment effect was in favour 
of vosoritide however there were only 8 subjects in this subgroup (3 and 5 subjects in vosoritide and 
placebo arms, respectively).

Pivotal trial in subjects in the age 0 to 60 months contributing to the Efficacy of Vosoritide 
15 μg/kg daily 
A separate study to include younger children was deemed appropriate due to possible pharmacokinetic 
differences, and due to differential growth patterns in younger children. Therefore, the applicant 
conducted Study 111-206 and the extension Study 111-208, similarly designed as those for the 
older age cohort (111-301 and 302) fully described above. Available evidence for efficacy is presented 
here since both studies are ongoing. Interim Study report was available with a data cut-off of 
12.09.2019 in the initial submission.  
The applicant provided additional open label efficacy data (as of 20 March 2021) during the procedure 
in 4 sentinel subjects from Cohort 1, aged 2 to 5 years, supported by data in 4 sentinel subjects in 
Cohort 2, aged 6 months to 2 years.

Months 
and 
Study 111-208: a Phase 2 Open-Label Long-Term Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy 
of BMN111 in Children with Achondroplasia” 
Methods 
Study 111-206 
Study 111-206 is an ongoing 52-week multicentre, Phase 2 randomised, open label un-controlled 
clinical study. The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and its impact 
on growth in infants and younger children recruited from birth to 60 months (5 years) of age with 
genetically confirmed ACH. The target number of subjects to be enrolled in 111-206 is 70 at 16 clinical 
centres worldwide. 
Subjects are enrolled into three age cohorts based on age at study screening starting with the eldest 
population. Within Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects are stratified by age: 
Cohort 1 – children aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥ 30 total: three sentinel subjects who receive 
vosoritide, and at least 27 additional subjects randomised 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), 
stratified by age (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥ 36 months to < 60 months). All subjects Cohort 1: 15 
μg/kg/day subcutaneous injection (all subjects) 
Cohort 2 – children aged ≥ 6 to < 24 months (n ≥ 20 total: three sentinel subjects who receive 
vosoritide, and at least 17 additional subjects randomised 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), 
stratified by age (≥ 6 months to < 15 months and ≥ 15 months to < 24 months). All subjects in this 
cohort are treated with 30 μg/kg/day adjusted to 15 μg/kg/day when subjects reach 2 years of age 
Cohort 3 – children aged 0 to < 6 months (n ≥ 20 total: three sentinel subjects receive vosoritide, and 
at least 17 additional subjects randomised 1:1 to treatment or placebo control). Treatment begins at ≥ 
3 months to < 6 months after 3 months of observation. (At the time of the data cut for the interim 
report initially submitted, enrollment in Cohort 3 had not commenced yet).

Study Participants  
Individuals eligible to participate in study 111-206 must meet all of the following criteria: 
1. Diagnosis of ACH, confirmed by genetic testing. If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects 
must have a lab report from a certified laboratory with the study specific mutation documented 
2. Age 0 to <60 months, at study entry (Day 1) 
3. Cohort 1 and 2 subjects must have at least a 6-month period of pre-treatment growth assessment 
in study 111-901 immediately before screening, and have one documented measurement of 
height/body length a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening visit for 111-206. Cohort 3 subjects 
must have a minimum of 3 months of observation prior to treatment. This observational period can be 
obtained either (1) via prior enrolment in 111-901 or (2) via enrolment in this 111-206 for a minimum 
of 3 months of non-treatment observation prior to commencement of treatment 
4. Parent(s) or guardian(s) (and the subjects themselves, if required by local regulations or ethics 
committee) are willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the 
study has been explained and prior to performance of any research-related procedure 
5. Willing and able to perform all study procedures as physically possible.  
6. Parent(s) or caregiver(s) are willing to administer daily injections to the subjects and complete the 
required training 
Individuals eligible to participate in Cohort 3 of Study 111-206 need to meet all of the following 
criteria: 
1. Parent(s) or guardian(s) willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the 
nature of the study is explained and prior to performance of any research related procedure. Also, 
willing and able to provide written assent (if applicable) after the nature of the study is explained and 
prior to performance of any research-related procedure 
2. Birth to ≤3 months of age at study entry 
3. Have ACH, documented by genetic testing 
4. Are willing and able to perform all study procedures as physically possible 
After completing the observation period, subjects must fulfill the general eligibility criteria prior to 
receiving treatment with study drug. 
Treatments 
Duration of Treatment: 52 weeks of treatment in study 111-206 (followed by long-term treatment in 
111-208 (until subjects reach NFAH). 
Cohorts start enrolling sequentially starting with the eldest group (Cohort 1). Each cohort includes at 
least 3 sentinel subjects receiving vosoritide to evaluate the short-term safety and PK of vosoritide 
before initiating the rest of the cohort for randomised subjects. The goal is to achieve exposures 
similar to that characterised to be safe and effective in children with ACH aged ≥ 5 years old enrolled in 
study 111-202 at the 15 µg/kg/day dose. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 123/191 
 
 
 
 
 
Cohort  1  sentinel  subjects  received  vosoritide  as  a  single  daily  dose  of  15µg/kg.  Analysis  of  PK  data 
showed that their exposure was comparable to the exposure range of 15 µg/kg/day in Study 111-202. 
Additional subjects were randomised to receive either vosoritide as a single daily dose of 15 µg/kg/day 
or placebo. The dosing schedule was a single daily SC dose.  
The same dose of 15 µg/kg was used for Cohort 2 sentinels. Analysis of PK data for Cohort 2 indicated 
that the appropriate dose to achieve the desired exposure is 30 µg/kg/day, subsequent for 3 sentinels 
were increased to 30 µg/kg/day until the subjects reach 2 years where they were returned to 15 µg/kg 
dosing. Cohort 3 will be evaluated the same way.

Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were performed. Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to <60 months at 
study entry were planned for participation in 111-206 and was considered appropriate to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of vosoritide in the target population. 
At the time of data cut-off of the initial submission, 44 patients were enrolled. 
Randomisation 
In study 111-206, sentinel subjects received open-label vosoritide and subsequent subjects are 
centrally randomised with stratification using an interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:1 ratio, 
i.e., injection with placebo: vosoritide. 
Subjects are being enrolled into three age cohorts based on the age at study screening starting with 
the eldest population. Cohorts 1 and 2 are stratified by age. 
An independent third-party vendor developed the randomisation schedule so that BioMarin and site 
personnel are blinded to treatment assignments. 
Blinding (masking) 
In study 111-206, vosoritide and placebo are packaged and labelled in the same way, with the study 
number and a unique identification number. The vosoritide placebo is designed to be comparable in 
appearance to vosoritide, is reconstituted in the same way, and contains all the components of the 
drug product except vosoritide, including commercially sourced sterile WFI. An independent third-party 
vendor developed the randomisation schedule so that BioMarin and site personnel did not know the 
treatment assignment. Subjects and the participating site members are blinded to study treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
Each measurement of standing height was converted to age- and sex-appropriate standard deviations 
score (SDS), also referred to as a height Z-score, by comparison with reference data available for 
average stature children from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Height Z-score, and its changes 
from baseline at Week 26 and Week 52 was summarised and presented for sentinel subjects by cohort 
and overall. 
AGV, upper to lower body segment ratio, and standing and sitting height were summarised similarly to 
height Z-score. Results were summarised for sentinel subjects by cohort and overall. Other 
anthropometric measures (sitting height, head circumference, etc.) were summarised at each time 
point and were evaluated for changes from baseline). For younger subjects, body length was measured 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

and used in the analyses instead of standing height. Similarly, crown-to-rump was measured instead of 
sitting height. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Disposition: At the time of the data-cut for the interim CSR (cut-off 12 Sep 2019), 44 subjects had 
enrolled into the study 111-206 and received treatment, four sentinel subjects and 26 randomised

Efficacy outcome – sentinel subjects (up data cut-off of 07 September 2020): 
Height Z-score Change from Baseline 
For Cohort 1 sentinel subjects the mean (SD) baseline height Z-score was -4.51 (0.33). For Cohort 1 
sentinel subjects (N=4), the mean (SD) change from Baseline in height Z score at Week 26 was +0.15 
(0.19) and at Week 52 was +0.34 (0.27). At Week 104, two of the three sentinel subjects showed an 
improvement in the height Z-scores of +0.77 SDS and +0.86 SDS, while an improvement of +0.27 
SDS (at Week 78) and +0.20 SDS was noted in the other two subjects. 
For Cohort 2 sentinel subjects the mean (SD) baseline height Z-score was -4.72 (0.53). For Cohort 2 
sentinel subjects (N=4), mean (SD) change from Baseline at Week 26 was +0.43 (0.69) and at Week 
52 was +0.84 (0.25).

Annualised Growth Velocity Change from Baseline 
Baseline AGV was 6.21 cm/year for Cohort 1 sentinel subjects and 11.93 cm/year for Cohort 2 sentinel 
subjects. In Cohort 1 sentinel subjects (N=4), following 26 weeks of treatment, there was a mean (SD) 
increase in AGV from Baseline of 0.69 (1.70) cm/year and after 52 weeks of treatment there was a 
mean (SD) increase of 0.57 (0.91) cm/year in AGV from Baseline. The AGV at Week 104 in 2 subjects 
and Week 78 for 1 subject was higher than the AGV at Baseline; with only a slight decline noted in the 
fourth subject at Week 104. The subject with the decline in the AGV had a high baseline AGV and was 
youngest in the Cohort; the decline in the AGV is likely due to the subject being in the steeper curve of 
the growth decline. 
In four Cohort 2 sentinel subjects, following 26 weeks of treatment, there was a mean (SD) decrease 
of 1.53 (3.03) cm/year in AGV from Baseline and of 2.75 (1.65) cm/year in AGV from Baseline at Week 
52.  
Upper to Lower Body Segment Ratio 
There was no change in upper to lower body ratio over time in both cohorts. In Cohort 1 sentinel 
subjects (N=4), mean (SD) change in upper to lower body segment ratio from Baseline to Week 26 
was -0.04 (0.06) and -0.02 (0.12) to Week 52. At week 104, a consistent reduction was noted in upper 
to lower body segment ratios in each of the subjects. 
For Cohort 2 sentinel subjects (N=2), the mean (SD) change in upper to lower body segment ratio 
from Baseline to Week 26 was -0.07 (0.05) and -0.19 (0.28) cm at Week 52. 
Standing Height and Sitting Height 
In Cohort 1 sentinel subjects (N=4), mean (SD) change in standing height from baseline was 3.38 
(0.82) cm at Week 26 and 6.78 (1.12) cm at Week 52. A consistent improvement was noted in 
standing height over 2 years of treatment in each of the subjects. Mean (SD) change in sitting height 
from baseline was 1.98 (1.12) cm at Week 26 and 4.69 (0.43) cm at Week 52. 
In the Cohort 2 sentinel subjects (N=2), mean (SD) change in standing height from baseline was 5.15 
(1.01) cm at Week 26 and 9.22 (0.98) cm at Week 52. Mean (SD) change in sitting height from 
baseline in 2 sentinel subjects was 3.70 (0.19) cm at Week 26. 
Body Proportion Ratios of the Extremities Change from Baseline 
There were no clinically significant changes in body proportions at Weeks 26 and 52. 
Growth Measures Change from Baseline 
Across all growth measures (head circumference, arm span, upper arm length, lower arm length, lower 
body length, upper leg length, knee to heel length, and tibial length) there were consistent positive 
improvements in growth in both Cohort 1 and 2. 
Updated efficacy results (cut-off of 20 March 2021) 
As of the data cut-off date of 20 March 2021, subjects in Cohort 1 (N=4) have received vosoritide for a 
median of 978 days (range: 921 to 1012 days) and in Cohort 2 (N=4) for a median of 733.5 days 
(range: 706 to 741 days). All sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 had treatment follow up for at least 130 
weeks across the two studies 111-206/208 and in Cohort 2 up to Week 104; of note, one subject in 
Cohort 2 did not have a height assessment at the Week 104 visit as the visit was scheduled post the 
data cut-off date. 
Height Z-Score 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 129/191 
 
 
 
 
In Cohort 1 sentinels, the reduction in height deficit as evaluated by the height Z-score was sustained 
with vosoritide treatment over 2.5 years, with mean (standard deviation [SD]) change from baseline at 
Week 52 (N=4) of +0.34 (0.27) standard deviation score (SDS), at Week 104 (N=3) of +0.62 (0.36) 
SDS, and at Week 130 (N=4) of +0.49 (0.34) SDS. For Cohort 2 sentinels, the mean (SD) change 
from baseline in height Z-score at Week 52 (N=4) was +0.84 (0.25) SDS and was sustained at Week 
104 (N=3) with a mean (SD) change from baseline of +0.69 (0.55) SDS. 
AGV 
In Cohort 1 sentinels the mean (SD) AGV at baseline was 6.21 (1.73) cm/year. The mean (SD) AGV in 
the first year of treatment in 111-206 remained at 6.78 (1.00) cm/year and in the second year of 
treatment in 111-208 was 5.85 (0.39) cm/year. In the Cohort 2 sentinels, the mean (SD) AGV at 
baseline was 11.93 (1.32) cm/year, in the first year of treatment was 9.17 (1.06) and was 6.55 (0.38) 
in the second year of treatment. This decline in AGV is not as pronounced as would be expected in the 
untreated children with ACH of this age range, thus illustrating positive effect of vosoritide on growth 
velocity. 
Standing Height/Body Length 
For Cohort 1 sentinels, the mean (SD) increase in standing height from baseline at Week 52 was 6.78 
(1.12) cm, at Week 104 was 12.91 (1.61) and at Week 130 was 15.28 (1.39). In Cohort 2 sentinels, 
mean (SD) change in standing height from baseline was 9.22 (0.98) cm at Week 52 and at Week 104 
was 15.76 (1.42). 
Upper to Lower Body Ratio 
In Cohort 1 sentinels, there was a reduction in the upper to lower body segment ratio over time with 
treatment with mean (SD) change in the ratio from baseline at Week 52 of ˗0.02 (0.12), at Week 104 
(N=3) of -0.19 (0.10), and at Week 130 (N=4) of -0.19 (0.14). In Cohort 2 sentinels, the mean (SD) 
reduction in the upper to lower body segment ratio at Week 52 (N=4) was -0.19 (0.28) with further 
decline observed at Week 104 (N=3), showing a mean (SD) change from baseline of ˗0.33 (0.20).

Notes 
Each measurement of standing height was converted to an age-and sex-
appropriate standard deviation score (SDS), also referred to as a Z-score, by 
comparison with reference data available for average stature children from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
ANCOVA model was used to determine the treatment difference between 
vosoritide and placebo at Week 52. Model terms included randomisation 
stratum defined by sex and Tanner stage, treatment, baseline age, baseline 
AGV, and baseline height Z-score. 
a: Two subjects in the vosoritide group discontinued from the study before 
Week 52 (1 due to an AE [anxiety about injections] and 1 due to subject 
request [subject was experiencing pain during injections]). The values for 
these 2 subjects were imputed for this analysis.

NOTE: Day 1 is considered as the first day subjects received vosoritide treatment. For 
subjects in the vosoritide arm in 111-301 (referred to as vos/vos), this will be the first 
day of treatment in 111-301 and for subjects who received placebo in 111-301 (referred 
to as plc/vos), this will be the first day of treatment in 111-302.  
Baseline is defined as the last assessment before the first dose of vosoritide. Therefore, 
for vos/vos subjects, their baseline assessment is the same as in 111-301. For plc/vos 
subjects, their baseline assessment is immediately prior to 111-302.

Baseline-growth assessment  
Study 901 (ongoing, observational growth study in children from birth to <7 years): A 
Multicentre, Multinational Clinical Assessment Study for Paediatric Patients with Achondroplasia 
With respect to the real world situation, it is noted that all patients included in the clinical development 
programme of vosoritide were initially enclosed in Study 901, which contribute also significantly to an 
adequate assessment of baseline in all trial subjects later included in the other trial. This study mainly 
intended to collect baseline growth measurements on paediatric subjects with ACH over 6 months in 
order to generate external comparisons and to demonstrate that the intended target population 
reflects the real clinical situation. 
Study 111-901 is a prospective, multicentre, multinational study that collects specific growth 
measurements on paediatric subjects with ACH being considered for subsequent enrolment in future 
studies sponsored by the applicant. Approximately 500 subjects from birth to ≤ 17 years of age at 
study entry were to be enrolled, with approximately equal numbers of boys and girls. 
Enrolled subjects underwent growth measurements at baseline and then subsequently at 3-month 
intervals until completion of the study (reaching the end of the protocol or enrolment in another 
BioMarin study), discontinuation of participation, or termination of the study. Subjects who did not 
enrol in a subsequent BioMarin drug-treatment study could choose to continue participating in Study 
111-901 for up to 7 years. No study drug was administered. Actually, 342 of the planned 500 subjects 
were included (Cut-off: as of 31 May 2019). The objectives of this study are to collect baseline growth 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

measurements on paediatric subjects with ACH. Subjects with at least 6 months of growth data were 
considered for possible participation in future drug-treatment studies sponsored by BioMarin (for 
subjects aged 0 to < 3 months at study entry, a minimum of 3 months of data were required). 
Growth parameters and analyses: 
• 
Endpoints were presented according to the study that the subject enrolled into: Study 111-
202, 111-206, or 111-301. Subjects who did not/or had not yet entered another vosoritide 
study were presented as “not enrolled”. Summary outputs also included an overall category. 
•  Annualised growth velocity (AGV), height Z-scores, and upper to lower body ratio were 
presented by study visit. 
All growth parameters were categorised by age (0, 1, 2 to maximum year of age) at the time 
of the assessment and were presented by sex and overall. 
•  HRQoL, functional independence, and ADL questionnaires: The scores in HRQoL questionnaires, 
functional independence, and ADL questionnaires (including PedsQL, QoLISSY, and WeeFIM) 
were summarised by age at the time of the assessment. CBCL, BSID-III, and ITQoL were listed 
due to limited available data. 
Patient population: Of the 342 subjects enrolled , 190 (55.6%) enrolled in a subsequent drug study: 
the majority (121subjects, 35.4%) enrolled in study 111-301; 35 subjects (10.2%) enrolled in study 
111-202, 34 subjects (9.9%) enrolled in study 111-206 and 152 subjects (44.4%) did not enroll in a 
subsequent drug study; enrollment into study 111-206 was ongoing.  
Of the 152 subjects who did not enroll in a subsequent drug study, 3 (2.0%) have completed study 
111-901, 71 (46.7%) remain on study, and 78 (51.3%) have discontinued from the study. The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) duration of follow-up overall in 111-901 was 19.32 (13.90) months (ranging 
from 0 to 75 months); this was equivalent to 550.6 patient-years. 
Baseline demographics, growth characteristics, medical history, and use of concomitant medication 
reflected the epidemiology of ACH and the geographic distribution of recruiting countries. Across all 
groups by subsequent enrollment, including those not enrolled into a drug study, there was a balance 
of male and female subjects and the majority were Caucasian. Overall, at the study 111-901 baseline, 
subjects were aged from newborn to 13.5 years, with a mean age of 5.45 years. Most subjects were 
Tanner Stage I. Overall, 95.3% of subjects had a medical history condition reported at baseline and 
89.8% had an ACH-related medical history condition reported at baseline. In general, the incidence by 
SOC of ACH-related medical histories were similar across all groups by subsequent enrolment, 
including those not enrolled into a drug study. Most subjects were receiving concomitant medication at 
entry to study 111-901 (87.7% overall), with those enrolling later in study 111-206 (the youngest age 
group) generally having the highest use of concomitant medications at baseline as well as concomitant 
medications initiated on-study.  
Results: 
AGV: Median (inter-quartile range [IQR]) AGV in subjects aged <1 year with ACH enrolled in study 
111-901 was 11.25 (5.53, 12.98) cm/year for females and 14.39 (14.10, 14.73) cm/year for males. 
By 1 year of age, median (IQR) AGV decreased to 7.21 (6.50, 7.80) cm/year in females and 7.81 
(7.09, 9.02) cm/year in males. AGV subsequently demonstrated a stable pattern by age, with a slow 
decline from the ages of 2-3 years to 10 years: median (IQR) AGV in subjects aged 2-10 years ranged 
from 5.59 (4.18, 7.32) to 3.46 (2.40, 4.51) cm/year in females and 5.87 (4.98, 6.54) to 3.53 (3.29, 
3.90) cm/year in males. Median AGV remained approximately 4 cm/year for females and males aged 
11 and 12 years. Median AGV for subjects enrolled in 111-901 was lower across all ages compared

with average stature children of a similar age, with the greatest difference observed between birth and 
1-2 years of age. 
Height Z-score: Compared with average stature children of a similar age, as measured by Z-scores, 
mean length/height deficit in both females and males with ACH enrolled in study 111-901 was high 
from birth (mean [SD] Z-scores of -3.68 [0.89] SDS for females and -3.88 [1.16] SDS for males) and 
the height deficit increased in subjects up to 5 years of age (Z-scores of -5.31 [1.08] SDS for females 
and -4.62 [0.78] SDS for males). Despite increasing variability after 5 years of age, the height deficit 
remained high in all age groups throughout the study. 
Standing and sitting height: Median (IQR) length for subjects aged <1 year for females was 54.87 
(52.50, 58.55) cm and for males was 58.37 (56.57, 61.40) cm. Median length/standing height 
gradually increased by age on study. For subjects aged 13 years the median (IQR) standing height for 
females was 122.83 (105.60, 126.25) cm and for males was 117.20 (114.90, 124.68) cm. 
As expected, and reflecting the Z-score values, the standing and sitting height values in study 111-901 
subjects with ACH are lower compared to average stature age-sex-specific reference data (CDC 2019) 
and are consistent with published data in ACH (Hoover-Fong 2017, Merker 2018) supporting the close 
resemblance of subjects in study 111-901 according to gender and age with the overall ACH 
population. For subjects with at least 36 months of data, individual standing height data plotted over 
time against average and short-stature reference data demonstrate that female and male subjects 
enrolled in study 111-901 are consistent with the ACH population, based on the published data 
(Hoover-Fong 2017), with standing height below average stature age-specific reference data. 
Upper to lower body segment ratio: study 111-901 data show disproportionality in upper to lower 
body ratio and are consistent with the published data in ACH children. Due to the limited growth of 
their extremities, the ratio of the upper to lower extremities in subjects with ACH never reaches 1 
(Hoover-Fong 2008). 
Other body proportion ratios and growth measures: Data reflected those presented above and 
demonstrated that subjects enrolled in study 111-901 have disproportionate short stature, shortening 
of upper to lower body segment, and rhizomelic shortening of arms and legs, which is consistent with 
the overall ACH population. In this study and consistent with those reported in the literature in ACH 
(Hoover-Fong 2008), BMI Z-scores in ACH subjects were higher than in average stature children.  
Supportive data with respect to long-term efficacy and safety outcome 
Study 111-205 (ongoing, interim CSR available, trial includes relevant information regarding 
long term efficacy and safety for this application) 
Study 111-205 is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, Phase 2 extension study to evaluate the long-
term safety and efficacy of BMN111 treatment in children with ACH who had completed Study 111-
202. Nine sites worldwide are participating in this study. This interim study report includes BMN111 
efficacy and safety data from all subjects enrolled in Study 111-205, from the time of their first dose 
of BMN111 received in Study 111-202, which was available up to the data cut-off of 20 November 
2019.  
In Study 111-202, subjects were sequentially enrolled into 4 cohorts to receive the different daily 
dosing regimens (please refer for details in Section 2.5.1. Dose response study of this assessment 
report).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 140/191 
 
 
 
 
 
Eligible subjects who then completed 2 years of BMN111 treatment in Study 111-202 were enrolled in 
the 111-205 extension study to continue receiving the same stable dose of BMN111 received upon 
completion of 111-202 (15 or 30 µg/kg daily). The Baseline visit for Study 111-205 was the same day 
as the final treatment visit and study completion visit (Month 24) for Study 111-202, during which 
subject consent was obtained. Ongoing AEs from Study 111-202 are collected in the Study 111-205 
medical history. In the event of a delay in starting Study 111-205, AEs were also reported in medical 
history. This information was included in the overall reporting of AEs. 
Subjects are to be followed either until they reached near-final adult height (NFAH) or for 5 years if 
NFAH occurred prior to the end of the 5-year period. At least 6 months of baseline growth data for all 
subjects who entered 111-202 was required to be collected in Study 111-901.  
111-Natural History Integrated Analyses  
The primary NH source (AchNH) was a retrospective, protocol-driven study to primarily characterize 
growth in subjects with ACH. It was conducted at four highly specialised US skeletal dysplasia centres, 
which systematically and comprehensively collected data. It is a large data source with a wealth of 
height data over the age range of subjects enrolled in the vosoritide studies, with a substantial number 
of assessments collected in a longitudinal manner. An assessment of potential bias of the database 
confirmed its validity and reliability. 
While height data were retrospectively collected, the data were highly concordant and comparable to 
prospectively designed study 111-901 across all ages and sexes as well as published data.  
The supportive NH data sources (111-901, LIAISE and KAISER) provided important data to corroborate 
the results of the primary analyses. 
The comparative analyses included comparisons between the vosoritide group (consisting of several 
treatment groups from studies 111-202/205 and 111-301) and the external control group (untreated 
ACH subjects from the NH sources). The subjects included in the external control group for most 
comparative analyses were selected by a sex and age matching process to each subject in the 
vosoritide group.  
Primary Analysis: The pre-specified primary analysis was a 5-year cross-sectional analysis to compare 
the difference between height at 5-year follow-up and at baseline between the vosoritide group 
(Cohort 3 [15 μg/kg] of 111-202/205) versus the sex and age matched external control group from 
the Primary NH Descriptive Population. In addition, sensitivity and supportive analyses were performed 
to assess the robustness of the results. 
The comparative analyses included comparisons between the vosoritide group (consisting of several 
treatment groups from studies 111-202/205 and 111-301) and the external control group (untreated 
ACH subjects from the NH sources). The subjects included in the external control group for most 
comparative analyses were selected by a sex and age matching process to each subject in the 
vosoritide group.

The difference in demographic and baseline growth characteristics is between each subject from the external control 
group of the NH source and their matched vosoritide subject. Height Z-Scores were derived using age sex specific 
reference data (means and SDs) for average stature children per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results from the primary and supportive pooled analyses are from two separate models. 
There was a statistically significant difference in height between the two groups at baseline (4.97 cm; 
p = 0.0431); this is principally due to one subject in Cohort 3 who had limb-lengthening prior to entry 
into the vosoritide study. At Year 5, there was a statistically significant difference in height between 
the two groups (14.04 cm; p = 0.0011). 
The baseline-adjusted mean difference at 5-year follow up was a statistically significant mean (95% 
CI) difference in height in favor of vosoritide (9.08 [5.77, 12.38] cm; two-sided p = 0.0002) compared 
the external control group of untreated ACH subjects. This analysis was consistent with the results 
using a sex and age matched external control group from the pooled other NH sources (8.74 [5.37, 
12.11]; two-sided p = 0.0002). 
5-Year Longitudinal Comparative Analyses (Cohort 3 of 111-202/205) on Height 
An ANCOVA model, with fixed effects for treatment and indicator variables for matching factors of sex 
and age, was applied for the 5-year longitudinal analyses to compare the change in height from 
baseline at Year 5 between the 10 subjects from Cohort 3 of 111-202/205 to sex and age matched 
subjects from the Primary NH Descriptive Population with 5 years follow-up (Table 47).  
The estimated mean difference in height between subjects in the vosoritide group and untreated ACH 
subjects in the external control was 8.40 cm with 95% CI (6.13, 10.67), p < 0.0001, in favour of 
vosoritide.

Potential Height at age of 16 years  
To understand the potential treatment effect on final height, individual subject’s height was 
extrapolated from the last height assessment at the data cut-off to the time when the subject reaches 
16 years of age. At the time of the data cut off the 10 subjects ages ranged from 11 to 16 years. 
Extrapolated mean results were compared to the mean height of 16-year-old males and females from 
the Primary NH Descriptive Population. Different assumptions were applied for the extrapolated growth 
ranging from the best case scenario that subjects continued to grow at the same rate at the time of 
the data cut to the worst case scenario that the subjects grew no more after the time of the data cut 
off. Height differences of up to 20 cm could be observed in favor of subjects in the vosoritide group at 
the age of 16 years compared with the external control (Table 48), and in the worst case scenario 
where the subjects no longer grew (last observed carried forward [LOCF]), there was a difference of 
8.71 cm compared between subjects in the vosoritide group to the external control.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Achondroplasia and rationale behind the clinical development of vosoritide 
The applicant developed vosoritide, a modified recombinant human CNP, for the treatment of ACH in 
the paediatric population. Vosoritide is a disease modifier.  
The primary deficit in subjects with ACH is a constitutively active mutated FGFR3 that negatively 
affects skeletal growth and development through inhibition of mitosis and cellular differentiation of 
chondrocytes, as well as matrix deposition in active growth plates. Since CNP activates NPR-B with 
inhibitory effects downstream in the Fgfr3 signalling cascade and thereby counteracts the effect of 
constitutive Fgfr3 activation on chondrocyte function, the product was developed for the treatment of 
ACH. The applicant applied for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and older 
and whose epiphyses are not closed. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant provided a comprehensive clinical data package with results from 7 prospective clinical 
studies including one study in healthy volunteers (111-101-FIM) and 6 in genetically confirmed ACH 
subjects: [111-202(+111-205) dose-finding, 111-301 (+111-302) pivotal phase 3 RCT (≥5-≤18 
years) and 111-206 (+111-208) pivotal phase 2 RCT (0-≤5 years). In order to optimise disease

characterisation of the untreated population at baseline and for further comparisons of the long-term 
outcome, the applicant has performed one observational study (111-901) and generated real world 
evidence (RWE) from different natural history (NH) sources.  
The CHMP acknowledged the strength of the clinical development programme since, although ACH is a 
rare orphan disease, the applicant has performed double-blinded placebo controlled randomised clinical 
trials to define efficacy (and safety) adequately. Since benefits and risks may differ, younger children 
below the age of 5 years were separately investigated after sufficient evidence was generated in those 
above 5 years of age. Moreover, the CHMP acknowledged that the endpoints as well as their 
assessment during all clinical trials was rather similar, which allows to prove consistency of the 
outcome and facilitate reliable pooling. The efficacy assessment is based mainly on anthropometric 
measurements. Primary endpoint was the AGV, which was validated and already accepted for the 
approval for several other growth-promoting products. The key secondary endpoints include Height Z-
score in order to demonstrate robustness of the primary outcome, as well as “upper to lower body 
segment ratio” and “standing height” as very important endpoints with respect to long-term outcome. 
In addition, several QoL scores and many other endpoints of interest in the target population were 
included and assessed. Regarding the endpoints assessment, the Type I error was adequately 
controlled by hierarchical testing. 
The trials’ objectives and endpoints are acceptable to the CHMP and were also agreed in a previous 
CHMP’s scientific advice. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, used are also agreed by the CHMP to 
characterise the target population of ACH patients. Upon the CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to revise 
the therapeutic indication to indicate that the diagnosis of ACH should be confirmed by appropriate 
genetic testing.  
Most recommendations provided from the scientific advices were adequately considered or -in the case 
not followed- the reasons were comprehensible justified. 
All patients in the clinical programme were initially included in the baseline observational growth study 
(111-901) at least for 6 months until they could be recruited for one of three studies (and their 
corresponding extension trials): 
a.)  Dose-finding study: 
Study 111-202 was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 2 study which included 34 ACH subjects at 
the age range of 5-14 years of age, who received vosoritide daily in doses of 2.5µg, 7.5µg, 15µg and 
30µg s.c. in 4 sequential cohorts of at least 8 subjects. Duration was 6 months, with an optional 
treatment extension of 18 months. Type I error was adequately controlled by hierarchical testing. 
After reaching the end of 24 months treatment in study 111-202, the 30 subjects could be rolled over 
in the long-term extension study 111-205. Subjects were followed until reaching near final adult 
height or a minimum of 5 years. Subjects in the low dose cohorts were transferred after completion of 
111-202 into the 15 µg/kg dose cohort to increase the information about the selected posology. 
b.)  Pivotal trial(s) for subjects from 5 to <18 years of age: 
Study 111-301 is a completed multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks of treatment with vosoritide (15 μg/kg daily) 
compared with placebo in children aged 5 to <18 years with a clinical diagnosis of ACH confirmed by 
genetic testing. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by sex and Tanner stage (Tanner stage 1, or 
Tanner stage >1), with no more than 20% of Tanner stage>1 to be enrolled. A total of 121 subjects 
were enrolled into the study; 61 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and 60 subjects to 
receive daily vosoritide 15 μg/kg. After 52 weeks of treatment, all 61 subjects in the placebo group 
completed the study and in the vosoritide group, 58 subjects completed and 2 subjects withdrew from 
CHMP assessment report

the study.  All subjects were transferred to the extension study 111-302, in which patients were 
treated with vosoritide until they either attain NFAH defined as evidence of growth plate closure and 
6-month interval AGV < 1.5 cm/year AGV or for 5 years, if NFAH occurs prior to the end of the 5-year 
period.  
c.)  Pivotal trial(s) for subjects from 0 to 60 months of age: 
Study 111-206 is an ongoing 52-week multicentre, phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical study. The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and 
its impact on growth in infants and younger children recruited from birth to 60 months (5 years) of 
age with genetically confirmed ACH. Subjects are or will be enrolled into three age cohorts based on 
age [Cohort 1: ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥ 30) / Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to < 24 months (n ≥ 20 ) / Cohort 3: 0 
to < 6 months (n: ≥ 20)] starting with the eldest population. Subjects in the extension trial 111-208 
will receive vosoritide until they reach reached NFAH. However, this trial was started in June 2018, at 
the time of data cut-off in September 2019 only 44 of the planned 70 subjects could have been 
included and enrollment in Cohort 3 has even not commenced yet. Only 6 patients finalised the 52 
weeks period and could be evaluated regarding efficacy; they were transferred to the extension trial 
208. Since the study is still ongoing and blinded, only very limited results are currently available. At 
the latest data cut-off, the applicant reported that the study is now fully enrolled with completion (last 
patient/last visit) expected by March 2022. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
a.)  Dose finding study  
In the dose finding study 202 at 6 months, a significant increase in AGV was observed with vosoritide 
at 15 and 30 μg/kg. The changes in AGV were dose dependent and achieved plateau with 15 μg/kg, 
(AGV-Median 2,5µg: -0.146; 7,5 mg: 1.348; 15µg: 2.652 and 30 µg: 2.899). Since no additional 
benefit in effect on AGV was seen with 30 μg/kg daily dose compared to 15 μg/kg, the CHMP agreed 
that the selected dose is adequately justified. The selected dose was further supported by the observed 
increase in AGV maintained over long-term treatment period for Cohorts 3 and 4 in the extension 
study 205. Moreover, participants initially receiving lower doses in Cohorts 1 (2.5 μg/kg dose) and 
Cohort 2 (7.5 μg/kg dose) transitioned to 15 μg/kg as the selected therapeutic dose during extension 
and their AGV increased over time, to the level observed with 15 μg/kg. These findings were consistent 
also if the key secondary endpoint Height Z-score was used for assessment. 
The once-daily regimen was selected because it was expected to yield a maximal treatment effect 
based on nonclinical evidence. In vitro studies demonstrated that a once-daily regimen resulted in a 
similar extent of chondrocyte proliferation relative to twice-daily or continuous exposure. This finding is 
consistent also with respect to the outcome of further pharmacodynamics parameters evaluated. 
b.)  Target population in the age from 5 to <18 years of age 
The initially presented short term analyses of AGV, based on the primary efficacy endpoint in study 
111-301 demonstrates a highly statistically significant improvement in AGV from baseline to Week 52 
(1-year) in favour of vosoritide with a least squared (LS) mean difference of 1.57 cm/year (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.22, 1.93, two-sided p <0.0001). The improvement in AGV observed at 52 
weeks (mean AGV 5.67 cm/year) was maintained after 104 weeks (mean AGV 5.64 cm/year). The 
maintenance of positive effect on AGV resulted in a continuous improvement in height Z-score, with a 
change from baseline of +0.24 SDS (LS mean difference of +0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17, 
0.39)) after 52 weeks of treatment and to +0.45 SDS after 104 weeks of treatment. Improvement in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 148/191 
 
 
 
 
the upper to lower body segment ratio was also observed, with a change from baseline of -0.03 after 
52 weeks and -0.09 after 104 weeks of treatment.  
The consistency of vosoritide treatment effect in AGV from baseline to Week 52 (1-year) was 
demonstrated in the pre-specified subgroup analyses for the following subgroups of interest: sex, age 
group, Tanner stage, strata, baseline height Z-score, and baseline AGV. In addition, these analyses 
were repeated with the subgroups of race and region showing also a consistent treatment effect.  
The comparative analyses on AGV, with follow-up of 18 months and 2 years using an 
observational/placebo and external control, demonstrated that treatment effect of vosoritide on AGV 
observed at 1 year is maintained with continued treatment through Month 18 and 2 years, as indicated 
by the consistency of the results. The CHMP agrees that the magnitude of the effect of vosoritide on 
AGV (mean difference of 1,57 cm / year) represents restoration of a substantial proportion of the 
estimated 2 cm/year AGV deficit observed between children with ACH and those with average stature 
in this age range (Hoover-Fong 2008, Kelly 2014). In the 15 μg/kg analysis population, which allows to 
assess additional children with longer observation periods are available from all trials the mean (SD) 
change from baseline in AGV to Year 1 was 1.49 (1.62) cm/year and to Year 5 (Month 60) was 1.34 
(1.31) cm/year. Considering the 95% confidence intervals, these results allow to presume the absence 
of clinically relevant tachyphylaxia. Compared to baseline, the improvement in AGV with vosoritide, 
was sustained year-by-year over 5 years of treatment, in reference to the untreated subjects with ACH 
at the studied age range, in whom a natural downward trend in AGV is observed (estimated to be 0.2 
cm/year) according the Natural history database available. The robustness of these results is 
demonstrated also by the outcome regarding the Height Z-Score: Short-term analyses of 
improvements in height Z-score in terms reported a LS mean difference of +0.28 SDS (95% CI: 0.17, 
0.39, p <0.0001) with reference to average stature children and thereby demonstrate consistency to 
the AGV outcome. In the updated efficacy analysis from study 111-302 provided during the 
procedure, consistency of efficacy was demonstrated both, in the initially vosoritide treated population 
as well as in the newly treated former placebo-receiving subjects. 
Similarly, the durability of the effect of vosoritide was also shown regarding the outcome on height Z-
scores in the long-term analyses was assessed using NH comparative analyses on height Z-score at 5 
years, in subjects treated in study 111-202/205. The relative improvement to placebo in standing 
height was observed after 1-year of treatment (LS mean change: 1.57 cm [ANCOVA model; 95% 
CI:1.21, 1.93, p < 0.0001, Study 111-301] in favour of vosoritide. The long-term increase in height 
gain, quantifying the sustained and durable effect of vosoritide after 5 years of treatment versus 
untreated children with ACH, has been confirmed using an external control in cross-sectional and 
longitudinal analyses using multiple sensitivity methods. These analyses report a baseline-adjusted 
mean difference at 5-year follow-up in cumulative height gain of 9.08 cm (95% CI [5.77, 12.38], 
P=0.0002) in favour of vosoritide. Although long-term data about efficacy during 4 to 5 years is 
currently restricted on 31 patients from study 111-205, including 10 patients treated only with 
vosoritide 15 µg/kg, the CHMP acknowledges that the incremental gain in height over 5 years of 
treatment was consistent with an approximate 5-time multiple of the gain in height observed in the 
pivotal study 111-301 over a 1-year period. This allows concluding that the positive effect on growth 
with vosoritide is maintained year-by-year. However, although the attempts to generate comparative 
efficacy data for time periods beyond the 1-year time horizon of the randomised study is 
methodologically acknowledged and overall reasonable, it needs to be considered that due to inevitable 
limitations of the underlying data the analyses are considered to be highly exploratory. More 
comparative data from the ongoing trials and also final height data will become available post-
marketing.

The effect on growth has not been associated with accelerated bone maturation, suggesting that final 
height may indeed be improved. In addition, improvement in linear growth was not associated with an 
unfavourable effect on body proportion. In fact, the 18-month comparative analysis of upper to lower 
body segment ratio indicates a trend for a greater decrease in ratio in the vosoritide arm compared to 
observational/placebo group, suggesting a small positive treatment effect.  
The ultimate endpoint for medicines used in childhood for improvement of growth is the final adult 
height. This information (height velocity, standing height, height Z-score changes, and upper to lower 
body segment ratios) will be available from the ongoing open label studies 111-205 and 111-302, 
which are Category 3 studies in the agreed RMP. 
Upon the CHMP’s request, criteria for stopping treatment have been amended in the Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC in alignment with the criteria for treatment discontinuation in the open label study 111-302, as 
follows: Treatment with this medicinal product should be stopped upon confirmation of no further 
growth potential, indicated by a growth velocity of <1.5 cm/year and closure of epiphyses. Since 
there are differences across countries in the EU in standard of care to assess closure of the epiphyses, 
criteria to assess closure of the epiphysis is not included in the SmPC, this is agreed by the CHMP. 
c.)  ACH Population younger than 5 years: 
Efficacy data in the population from 2 to <5 years of age from the phase 2 trial 111-206 is currently 
available only for 4 sentinel subjects in cohort 1 at time of data cut-off in September 2020. From 
baseline to 52-weeks of treatment, these patients experienced a mean (median) increase in height Z-
score of 0.34 (0.27), which appears encouraging. At Week 104, two of the three sentinel subjects 
showed an improvement in the height Z-scores of +0.77 SDS and +0.86 SDS, while an improvement 
of +0.27 SDS (at Week 78) and +0.20 SDS was noted in the other two subjects. AGV at Week 104 
indicated that vosoritide treatment reverted the decline in AGV expected in most of the subjects, with 
consistent improvement observed over 2 years of treatment. In addition, the effect appears to be 
greater in the population younger compared to those older than 5 years, which is biologically plausible 
since the maximum growth deficit in children with achondroplasia is accrued before 5 years of age. 
There was no worsening in upper to lower body segment ratio, which is clinically important as it 
indicates that the observed increase in growth is occurring proportionally in both the spine and the 
lower limbs. 
Additional data with a cut-off on 20 March 2021 were provided for sentinel subjects from Cohort 1. 
Subjects in Cohort 1 have received vosoritide for a median of 978 days (range: 921 to 1012 days) and 
the available efficacy data continue to show positive trends across outcome measures. 
In addition to the efficacy results available in patients 2 to 5 years, the applicant argued that the 
extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger children is further supported based on the following 
elements: 
1) the pathophysiology of ACH which is a genetic disorder caused by a single mutation with 
the underlying pathophysiology of the disease being similar in all age groups  
2) the mechanism of action of vosoritide that directly targets the underlying pathophysiology 
of ACH by down regulating Fgfr3 signalling  
3) vosoritide pharmacology, bone-specific biomarker response, based on PD marker cGMP 
and bone-specific biomarker serum CXM, showing the time course and pattern of changes 
consistent with changes seen in the older children treated with vosoritide (see Discussion on 
Clinical Pharmacology). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 150/191 
 
 
 
 
The applicant’s argumentation is agreed, the efficacy in children as of 2 years of age is considered 
sufficiently demonstrated. However, since uncertainties remain in children 2 to 5 years of age, the 
ongoing study 111-206 in this subgroup is important for the collection of additional efficacy data. 
Submission of final results for study 111-206 is an imposed condition to the marketing authorisation 
(category 1 study).Health related Quality of Life evaluation outcomes of vosoritide treatment in the 
target population remains inconclusive, since no difference was detected between the vosoritide and 
the placebo groups in the pivotal trial after 52 weeks of treatment. However, it is agreed with the 
applicant’s argumentation, that it is likely that signals for any change in Quality of life scores may only 
occur after significantly longer treatment duration than currently assessable. Nevertheless, it is noted 
that the QoL assessment was adequately included in all ongoing extension studies. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Vosoritide has been shown to be efficacious in children with ACH children from 5 to <18 years of age. 
Data from the pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 studies 111-301/302, together with the already 
available long-term data in studies 202/205, demonstrate a consistent statistical significant and clinical 
relevant efficacy for the primary endpoint AGV. Results are robust as indicated by a consistent 
outcome for the key secondary endpoints Height Z-Scores as well as standing height. This is illustrated 
by the highly statistically significant improvement in AGV from baseline to Week 52 (1-year) in favour 
of vosoritide with a least squared (LS) mean difference of 1.57 cm/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.22, 1.93, two-sided p <0.0001). This suggests that about 75% of the normal growth in the 
corresponding age could be restored.  
Although long-term data about efficacy during 4 to 5 years is currently restricted to 31 patients from 
study 111-205, it seems important that the incremental gain in height over 5 years of treatment was 
consistent with an approximate 5-time multiple of the gain in height observed in the pivotal study 111-
301 over a 1-year period. This might allow concluding that the positive effect on growth with vosoritide 
is maintained long term.  
For patients between 2 to 5 years in the pivotal RCTs 111-206/208, growth data from 4 (8) sentinel 
patients are encouraging. Efficacy in the lower age group is also based on extrapolation of efficacy 
from older (5 to <18 years) to the younger children (2 to 5 years) based on the pathophysiology of 
ACH, vosoritide mechanism of action and vosoritide pharmacology. Therefore, and because early 
treatment is likely to maximise patient benefit, CHMP agrees to include patients from the age 2 years 
in the authorised indication.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
PAES: In order to further evaluate the efficacy of vosoritide in patients aged 2-5 years, the 
MAH should submit the final results of the study 111-206, an ongoing Phase 2 randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the safety and efficacy of daily SC 
injections of vosoritide in younger children with achondroplasia. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data from seven interventional studies are included in this application: 111-101 (up to 15 μg/kg

μg/kg vosoritide), and 111-301 and 111-302 (15 μg/kg vosoritide).  
In the non-clinical studies, the toxicity in animals was rather low and off-target toxicities seemed to be 
nearly absent.

The Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies were considered generally similar in design to justify pooling of the 
data to facilitate evaluation of long-term safety of vosoritide on the maximum number of ACH subjects 
exposed to vosoritide for the longest duration. Three pooled populations were defined to evaluate the 
safety profile of vosoritide in ACH subjects: 
•  All Treated population (pooled) – all ACH subjects treated with daily vosoritide irrespective of the 
age or dose received (N=164) 
•  Maximum 15 μg/kg population - all ACH subjects treated with at least one dose of, and no 
higher than, vosoritide 15 μg/kg daily (N=148) 
•  Pure 15 μg/kg population - all ACH subjects aged ≥5 years treated exclusively with vosoritide 15 
μg/kg daily (N=131)  
Patient exposure 
Vosoritide is intended for the use in an orphan disease population. In COMP’s orphan disease 
designation a frequency of ~1: 25000 is reported. This explains the comparable low number of 
patients exposed, which may affect the reliability of safety assessment regarding rare events. From the 
164 subjects included in the pooled safety population 96 (58.5%) have longer exposure to vosoritide 
than 1 year and in 15 subjects (9.1%) exposure is longer than 5 years (Table 49).

• 
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 trial 111-301, a total of 60 subjects received vosoritide 
and 61 received placebo. The mean (SD) duration of treatment was comparable between the 
vosoritide (353.0 [65.6] days) and placebo (364.8 [4.38] days) groups, with a total treatment 
exposure of 57.99 and 60.93 person-years, respectively. A mean (SD) total of 348.8 (65.1) and 
359.6 (9.5) doses were administered in the vosoritide and placebo groups, respectively, over the 
52-week study duration, with similar number of mean (SD) doses missed (4.4 [7.0] and 5.3 
[10.1], respectively). 
• 
In the All Treated population, as of the data cut-off for the MA, a total of 164 subjects in the 
Phase 2 and 3 studies have been exposed to any dose of vosoritide. Of these, 148 subjects have 
received at least one dose of, and not higher than 15 μg/kg vosoritide, and 131 subjects have 
exclusively received 15 μg/kg vosoritide. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 152/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  At the time of data cut-off, subjects in the All Treated population had been exposed to any dose of 
vosoritide for a duration ranging from 1 day to 69.3 months (> 5 years), with a median duration 
of 13.7 months, corresponding to 255.13 person-years of treatment exposure. The maximum 
duration of 69.3 months was largely driven by the treatment duration in 111-202/205 studies. 
At the time of MA submission, data in children below the age of ≤5 years at the time of treatment start 
(as well as ≥ 15 years) was very limited and restricted to 8 (or 11) patients. The study 111-206 had 
recruited at the time of MA cut-off 44 patients (~ planned about 70 patients) and considering the 
duration of 52 weeks in trial 111-206 more mature data regarding safety should be available post 
authorisation.  
During the MA procedure, the applicant provided the updated safety from 8 sentinel subjects that 
seemed not to indicate a different safety in younger children.  
In addition, updated safety data after initial submission including 102 weeks data from the initial 
population of the pivotal trial 111-301 now included in the extension trial 111-302 (including former 
placebo subjects) was provided (30 June 2020).  
Adverse events 
In the pooled safety data population (all treated population) a slightly lower number of patients 
(82.3%) experienced at least 1 AE during the studies with an overall exposure adjusted event rate of 
79.01 AEs/person-year. Serious AEs were experienced by 9 (5.5%) subjects; none were considered 
related to study treatment or led to study drug or study discontinuation.  
The majority of AEs reported during the studies were Grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate), with 10 (6.1%) 
subjects in the All Treated group reporting a Grade 3 (severe) event.  
No Grade 4 AEs or deaths were reported. A total of 3 (1.8%) subjects discontinued treatment due to 
an AE, including 1 subject treated with 30 μg/kg due to Wolff-Parkinson syndrome (Grade 1), and 2 
subjects treated with 15 μg/kg due to AEs of procedural anxiety (Grade 1) and transaminases 
increased (Grade 2) each. Table 50 and Table 51 provide an overview:

Common adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled population of study 111-301, in both treatment groups, AEs were most 
frequently reported in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions (90.0% in the 
vosoritide group versus 82.0% for placebo), followed by infections and infestations (63.3% versus 
75.4%). Similarly, the highest event rates were reported in the general disorders and administration 
site conditions SOC (120.8 AEs/person-year for vosoritide versus 29.7 AEs/person-year for placebo) 
followed by infections and infestations SOC (1.7 AEs/person-year in both groups). Event rates for the 
remaining SOCs were <1 AE/person-year in both treatment groups. The higher event rate for the 
general disorders and administration site conditions in the vosoritide group was largely driven by 
incidence of AEs related to injection site reactions (Table 52).

In the larger pooled safety population, which includes 104 additional patients to those investigated in 
the pivotal trial 111-301, the frequency of the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were 
rather similar: ISR (49.4%), injection site erythema (47.0%), nasopharyngitis (28.7%), injection site 
swelling (24.4%), cough (20.1%), headache (20.1%), pyrexia (23.2%), and vomiting (22.6%). Most 
AEs were Grade 1 (mild) in severity. Assessment of the details results not in identification of any 
relevant or clinically meaningful difference. In the limited data of subjects received a higher dose of 30 
µ/kg, no evidence is seen for a clear dose dependency of any of these events. 
With respect to pharmacodynamically reasoned adverse events of injection site reaction and blood 
pressure, also a slightly more pronounced incidence of arthralgia might be seen as clearly drug related.

Grade 3 (severe) TEAEs were less frequent (vosoritide: 5.0% versus placebo: 4.9%) and overall 
balanced in the pivotal study. The absence of any grade ≥4 AEs and deaths also in the pooled safety 
population illustrate a rather low toxicity which is accordance with the non-clinical safety findings. Only 
one subject discontinued the study treatment (vosoritide arm) due to Grade 1 anxiety to injections. 
During the evaluation, the applicant provided upon the CHMP’s request updated safety information 
(Data cut-off date 30 June 2020). 
As of the 30 June 2020, 3 new subjects were included in the safety analyses (all 3 subjects in 111-206 
Cohort 3 aged < 6 months of age), and a total of 167 subjects had been treated with vosoritide for a 
total exposure of 358.46 patient-years (an increase of 101.60 patient-years when compared to the 
initial marketing authorisation application [MAA]) (Table 56) in the pooled safety population. A total of 
6 new subjects discontinued study treatment, of which 3 discontinued due to withdrawal of consent 
and 3 subjects reached NFAH as defined in the protocol. None of the subjects withdrew due to AEs 
during this period.

As of 30 June 2020, a total of 17 SAEs were reported in 14 (8.4%) subjects overall in the pooled 
population in the All Treated population (Table 57). Six subjects reported a total of 7 new SAEs in the 
All Treated population since the data cut-off date for individual studies for the MAA submission. In 
addition, 5 SAEs were reported in 5 randomised subjects in the 111-206/208 studies. The most 
common SAEs were reported in the SOC of Congenital, familial and genetic disorders (developmental 
hip dysplasia and syringomyelia in one subject each) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (lumbar spinal stenosis and spinal stenosis in one subject each). None of the SAEs were 
assessed as related to vosoritide and were consistent with common medical conditions in childhood or 
with complications of ACH and were reported at expected frequencies in the ACH population. 
Four new Grade 3 AEs were reported in 3 subjects, and 1 subject had a Grade 4 AE; none of the Grade 
3 and higher events were assessed as related to study drug by the investigator (Table 57).

As of 30 June 2020, transient injection site reactions (ISRs) were the most commonly reported AE. A 
total of 84.9% of subjects (90/106 subjects from 111-202, 111-301, and 111-206 sentinels) reported 
ISRs in the first year of treatment with an exposure adjusted event rate of 142.53 AEs/person-year. Of 
note, all ISRs, irrespective of severity and duration, were reported in the first year of treatment in 111-
301, 111-202, and 111-206, and the denominator (n=106) includes subjects from these 3 studies 
only. The majority of ISRs were transient, non-serious, mild (Grade 1) in severity, and resolved 
without medical intervention. No subjects interrupted or discontinued from treatment due to ISR-
related events. The pattern and severity of ISRs did not change or worsen over time. 
New events of blood pressure decreases were reported in 3 subjects (Grade 2 hypotension in two 
subjects and Grade 1 blood pressure decrease in 1 subject). Of these three events, documented 
symptomatic hypotension was reported in 2 subjects, both with Grade 2 hypotension. Both events 
resolved without medical intervention within an hour. None of the subjects reported events of slipped 
capital femoral epiphysis, avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis, or fractures changes post MAA data cut-
off date. All hypersensitivity AEs (HAEs) were ≤ Grade 2 in severity and the type of HAEs were similar 
to events reported in the initial MAA. 
There have been no reported AEs suggestive of off-target effects with long-term exposure including 
effects on the hepatic, kidney, central nervous system, respiratory, or reproductive systems. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 10 SAEs were reported in 9 subjects across all Phase 2 and 3 vosoritide studies. These events 
are  reported  as  sleep  apnoea  syndrome  [2subjects],  tonsillar  hypertrophy,  thyroglossal  cyst, 
syringomyelia, influenza, adenoidal hypertrophy, radius fracture, otitis media chronic, generalised tonic 
clonic seizure). The types of events reported as SAEs were consistent with common childhood illnesses 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

or  with  events  expected  in  children  with  ACH.  None  of  the  SAEs  were  assessed  as  related  to  study 
treatment or led to study drug discontinuation.  
No deaths occurred in the clinical development of vosoritide. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI): 
According the non-clinical and secondary pharmacology data injection sites reactions (ISR), blood 
pressure decreases, hypersensitivity (SMQ narrow terms), fractures, and heart rate changes as well as 
slipped capital femoral epiphysis or avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis were defined as adverse events 
of special interest.  
Injection sites reactions: Although similar number of subjects were reported with injection sites 
reactions in the vosoritide (51 (85.0%) subjects) and placebo arm (50 (82.0%) subjects) groups, the 
total number of events reported were higher in the vosoritide group (6983 events with an event rate of 
120.4 AEs/person-year) compared to placebo (1776 events with an event rate of 29.2 AEs/person-
year). Mean (SD) number of ISRs experienced per-subject with daily SC injections over the 52-week 
treatment period, in the vosoritide group compared to placebo, were 136.9 (137.9) versus 35.5 (70.0) 
events, with a median of 76.0 (range 1 to 365) versus 7.5 (range 1 to 355) events. This identifies ISR 
as a drug related adverse event, which could be expected for an active injectable peptide product 
associated with immunisation to some degree over time. The ISR PTs reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in 
vosoritide group, were injection site reaction (73%), injection site erythema (68%), injection site 
swelling (38%) and injection site urticaria (13%). Injection site reactions were Grade 1 (mild) in 
severity at the exception of 5 Grade 2 (moderate) events described in the vosoritide arm in two 
subjects probably reflecting immunisation (2 events of injection site urticaria, and 1 event of injection 
site vesicles while further 2 events were summarised as injection site reaction only).  
The majority of ISRs resolved in < 24 hours; those lasting ≥ 24 hours in the vosoritide group compared 
to placebo, were injection site reactions (V:15 versus Plc:6 events) and injection site bruising (V: 15 
versus Plc:10 events). 
Data submitted regarding the pooled safety population seemed to be overall in line with the findings in 
the trial 111-301 population, but due to slightly different mode of reporting, the lower incidence of 53 
% may be less reliable compared with the data from the pivotal RCT. 
Blood pressure decreases: Consistent with the biological effects of CNP on vascular function (cGMP 
release) transient decreases in DBP could be expected and were observed in the non-clinical trials. 
Insofar, it is not surprising that blood pressure decreases were described under the most common 
ADRs. A decreased blood pressure was observed in 8 (13.3 %/ 11 events) patients treated with 
vosoritide compared to 3 (4.9%/ 3 events) in the placebo arm of the pivotal trial 111-301. The median 
time to onset from injection was 31 (18 to 120) minutes, except for 1 event in the vosoritide group 
that resolved within 2 hours, all remaining events resolved within 1 hour, (mean [SD] duration, 37.0 
[28.6] minutes; median duration, 31.0 [range 5 to 90] minutes).  
All events were Grade 1 (mild), and no subject discontinued treatment due to an AE of decrease in BP. 
A numerically slightly higher rate of 28 (17.1%) events is reported in the All Treated Population. 
However, there were no Grade 3 or 4 events, and none of the events were serious or led to 
discontinuation of study treatment. With one exception, the events with BPD were asymptomatic and 
the severity of the only symptomatic case was Grade 1 (post-dose SBP decrease of <20 mmHg/ DBP 
decrease of <10 mmHg). The reported events were identified predominantly during periods of frequent 
vital signs monitoring at clinical visits after dosing over a 52-week treatment period. No patients in the 
whole safety population needed any specific treatment and the only symptomatic episode observed 
was short-lasting (< 5 minutes with dizziness and vomiting after sitting up quickly) and self-limiting.

In addition to the above symptomatic hypotension reported by the Investigator, the Sponsor evaluated 
all AEs, using a pre-defined list of PTs, to identify symptoms that could potentially be associated with 
blood pressure decrease, which identified the following AE PTs (excluding the symptomatic ones 
already described above): fatigue (4 [6.7%] subjects [4 events] for vosoritide versus none for 
placebo), nausea (3 [5.0%] subjects [3 events] for vosoritide versus 4 [6.6%] subjects [6 events] for 
placebo), presyncope (without associated fall in BP) (2 [3.3%] subjects [2 events] for vosoritide 
versus none for placebo), and dizziness (4 [6.7%] subjects [5 events – 4 dizziness, 1 procedural 
dizziness] for vosoritide versus 1 [1.6%] subject [1 event] for placebo). Many of these events in the 
vosoritide group occurred at home without corresponding BP measurements, and hence due to the lack 
of BP values at the time of the event, no causality could be associated between these reported AEs 
with a reduction in BP. The adverse reactions of syncope, pre-syncope, dizziness and fatigue are 
considered clinically relevant as ADR. 
Syncope was added as an ADR based on occurrence of 2 events of syncope in 1 subject (3%) in 
relation to blood draws during the Phase 2 open-label study 111-202 (N = 35); no events of syncope 
were reported in 111-301. 
Tachycardia is reported in two subjects in the pooled safety population. No case was reported from the 
pivotal trial. In the two cases in the pooled safety population, no interventions were needed and the 
reasons for the tachycardia remain unknown in spite of cardiological diagnostic. 
Hypersensitivity reaction: Please refer to the section on Immunological events 
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis or avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis: An increased risk for bone 
and joint malformation probably leading to osteonecrosis and cartilage dysfunction was 
observed in healthy animals. Although the relevance of the observed findings in animal for the human 
ACH target population is uncertain, events like spontaneous or fractures due to inadequate trauma are 
of special interest. Similarly, events indicating growth associated impairment of bone and cartilage 
composition, which may lead to avascularnecrosis/osteonecrosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis 
are relevant. Overall, two fractures, both events followed an adequate trauma and did not occur 
spontaneously, are reported in the pooled safety population. Both fractures healed without 
complications. The events were assessed as not related to vosoritide treatment. No events of avascular 
necrosis or osteonecrosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurred in any of the treatment groups. 
Drug interruptions: 
In the placebo controlled pivotal trial 111-301, the proportion of subjects experiencing AEs and SAEs 
that led to study drug interruption was similar between the vosoritide (10 [16.7%] and 2 [3.3%] 
subjects, respectively) and placebo (10 [16.4%] and 2 [3.3%] subjects, respectively) groups.  
Laboratory findings 
With respect to the haematological parameter in the laboratory AEs interpretation of slight differences 
between vosoritide and placed in favour for placebo were noted. There were some shifts from baseline 
to a worsened severity for some parameters such as lymphocytes increased/decreased or shifts to 
grade 2 for neutrophils decreased (Table 58). The majority of shifts that occurred were self-limiting, 
resolved on or before the next scheduled visit.

Neither in the pivotal trial 111-301 nor in the pooled safety population clinically meaningful changes in 
the mean values for any of the clinical chemistry parameters over time were identified with respect to 
vosoritide. According to the data, no clinically significant changes in any chemistry parameters at any 
time in the total study population is reported. Smaller changes observed in laboratory testing return to 
normal values in almost all patients within the time to the next visit. The difference in ALP in 
comparison has to be seen as an indication for a higher osteoblastic activity (efficacy) rather than as 
hepatic safety signal.  
Vital signs 
Blood pressure (BP) 
There were no notable differences between the vosoritide and placebo groups in overall mean change 
from baseline of pre-dose SBP, DBP, or HR at Week 26 or Week 52. Overall, the median values of SBP, 
DBP, and HR were comparable between the two treatment groups, and no clinically significant change 
in mean pre-dose SBP, DBP, or HR from baseline was noted in either group at any visit. However, a 
slightly more negative change in DBP and a slight compensatory increase in HR from pre-dose to post-
dose values was observed in the vosoritide group, on Study Day 1, Week 26 and Week 52, when 
compared with the placebo group. 
Electrocardiogram 
No formal thorough QT (TQT) study was performed, based on 1) the sequence homology between 
vosoritide and endogenous CNP peptide; 2) the large size of this biologic peptide, such that an effect 
on cardiac ion channels is very unlikely; 3) the low QT prolongation potential characterised in the 
nonclinical program; 4) a negative hERG assay; and 5) lack of any signal in early phase clinical 
development (ECG data from 111-101 and 111-202). 
CHMP assessment report

An integrated cardiac safety report was prepared by an independent 3rd party including the exposure-
response modelling for subjects in the Phase 3 studies 111-301 and 111-302. The data indicate no 
clinically significant effect of vosoritide on cardiac repolarisation, and a QT prolonging effect of ≥ 20 
msec at clinically relevant exposures was excluded. A small, but clinically unimportant effect on PR 
interval was noted. The mean placebo-corrected ΔPR (ΔΔPR) ranged from −10.9 msec (Week 52) to 
−7.0 (Day 10) in study 111-301. No clinically relevant effect on QRS was observed, and no significant 
treatment-related morphology changes were observed. 
There were no meaningful changes in mean ECG intervals over the study period (up to Month 66). 
Imaging Assessments 
To monitor for any potential adverse effect on skeletal growth, imaging assessments were included in 
111-301/302 and 111-202/205 studies. These included X-rays of 1) the lower extremities to assess 
growth, 2) the lumbar spine to assess bone morphology and pathology and 3) the left hand and wrist 
to assess bone age. In studies 111-301/302, bone mineral density and bone mineral content were also 
assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), whilst in 111-202/205 quantitative computed 
tomography (QCT) was performed. 
Data were not pooled across studies due to differences in imaging service provider between 111-
301/302 and 111-202/205 studies. Data from the placebo-controlled data over 52 weeks from 111-
301 followed by data up to Month 48 from 111-202/205 studies were provided. 
In summary, there has been no evidence of disproportionate skeletal growth, accelerated bone age, 
abnormal bone morphology or negative changes in bone mineral density or content with vosoritide 
treatment over time. 
Bone Age 
Bone age was assessed using the Greulich and Pyle Atlas method using X-rays of the left hand and 
wrist (Greulich 1971; Tanner 1976). The improvements in growth have not been associated with 
premature bone maturation as assessed by the effect of vosoritide on bone age. 
Study 111-301 
Bone age at baseline was approximately 8 years in both the placebo and vosoritide treatment arms. At 
Week 52, mean (SD) change from baseline was approximately 1 year in both treatment arms (1.02 
years [0.83] and 1.14 years [0.82] in the vosoritide and placebo groups, respectively) showing normal 
skeletal maturity over the 52-week period. This was similar in both males and females. 
Study 111-202/205 
Consistent with the observations in 111-301 study, the assessment of bone age using Greulich and 
Pyle method, did not show any abnormal acceleration or abnormal changes in skeletal maturity with 
vosoritide up to Month 48. 
Lower Limb X-Rays 
X-rays were performed to assess growth of the lower extremity long bones, status of their growth 
plates and tibial bowing.  
There was no evidence to suggest an imbalance in the growth of long bones in the lower extremities; 
both tibia and fibula increased in length in a proportional manner over time. There was no worsening in 
manifestations of genu varum (tibial bowing). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 164/191 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 111-301 
For left and right tibia bowing angle, there was no clear or consistent change from baseline in either 
treatment group at Week 52, suggesting that there was no worsening in manifestations of genu varum 
with consistent growth rates between tibia and fibula. 
For left and right tibia distance between ankle joint and distal growth plate of fibula, there was no clear 
or consistent change from baseline in either treatment group at Week 52, suggesting that there was no 
imbalance in growth rates between tibia and fibula. 
Study 111-202/205 
An increase in both tibia and fibula length was observed over time with a 1:1 ratio. 
There was no clinically meaningful change from baseline in the tibia bowing angle by age group. The 
long-term positive effect on growth was not associated with findings indicative of pathological changes 
in bones of lower extremities during prolonged treatment with vosoritide. 
Lumbar Spine X-Rays 
There was no evidence to suggest any adverse effect on growth of the vertebral bodies or spinal canal 
with no treatment-related worsening in ACH-related skeletal abnormalities such as lordosis and 
kyphosis. 
Study 111-301 
Sagittal width of the spinal canal, interpedicle distances, and vertebrae heights were measured for 
each of the lumbar vertebrae. Anterior height to medial height, anterior height to posterior height and 
medial height to posterior height ratios were calculated for each individual vertebra (L1 to L5). Angles 
of sacral tilt, lordosis (inward curve of the spine) and kyphosis (convex curvature of the spine) were 
also assessed. 
A proportional increase in the height of the vertebral bodies was observed in both the vosoritide and 
placebo treatment groups; there was no obvious change in any of the ratios by Week 52. 
At Week 52, there was no change from baseline in interpedicle distance in lumbar vertebrae or change 
from baseline in the width of spinal canal in either treatment arm within each age category. 
The change from baseline in mean sacral tilt, lordosis and kyphosis angle were numerically small and 
similar between treatment groups and age categories; no obvious trend by age was observed.  
Study 111-202/205 
No notable change was observed in the vertebrae height ratios, interpedicular distance of the lumbar 
vertebrae or width of the spinal canal through Month 48. There were no consistent or notable change 
in thoracolumbar kyphosis or lumbosacral lordosis angles over time with exception of one subject in 
Cohort 2. This male subject (age 11 years at baseline) had pre-existing thoracolumbar kyphosis at 
baseline (angle of 38 degrees). Over the first 2 years of the study, there was no significant change in 
the kyphosis angle. At Month 48, his kyphosis worsened to 55 degrees, he was asked to wear a brace 
but was not compliant; corrective surgery is planned. This was captured as an AE. 
Bone Mineral Density and Bone Mineral Content 
In 111-301, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were performed to collect relevant bone mineral 
content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) data for whole body less head and the lumbar spine. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 165/191 
 
 
 
 
 
All DXA data was summarised separately for each scanner manufacturer (GE - Lunar Prodigy or Hologic 
– Discovery Horizon). 
Compared to placebo, there were no notable differences in BMC or BMD at any of the sites studied over 
52 weeks with vosoritide. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the pooled safety population (All Treated pooled group). In 
these analyses, differences in safety outcome regarding sex, ages, race/ethnicity groups and 
geographical regions were not observed. It is agreed that in the small paediatric population analysed, 
no clinically significant differences were observed in the profile of AEs by any of these parameters. 
However, the conclusions on these analyses are limited by the low number of patients. 
Due to the paediatric indication, no data in elderly patients can be expected and the age subgroup 
analysis is restricted. It is acknowledged that the overall incidence of AEs, and type and nature of 
events reported in the small number of subjects in the age of 2 to <5 years was no different to those 
reported for subjects older than 5 years in the pooled analyses; the commonly reported AEs were 
mostly ISR-related events. There have been no SAEs assessed as related to study drug, no Grade 3 or 
higher AEs, and no symptomatic decreases in BP reported in younger subjects in 111-206 as of the 
data cut-off date.  
Immunological events 
Since vosoritide is a peptide, immunisation and potential hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE) are of 
special interest with respect to safety. The incidence and the effect of anti-vosoritide antibodies was 
evaluated in the context of reported ISRs, HAEs, and safety impact associated with cross-reactive 
antibodies.  
In the pooled safety analysis (Phase 2 (111-202/205) and 3 (111-301/302) studies), ADA responses 
were detected in approximately 34% to 63% of subjects across studies with the incidence being 38% 
(59/156) in the All Treated population and earliest time to ADA development being Day 85. The 
magnitude of TAb titers ranged from 14 to 18,500 with 35% of the TAb-positive subjects showing a 
decline in titers back to baseline levels by the end of the treatment duration in the study. 
Neutralising antibodies (NAb) were detected in 2% (3/156) of All Treated subjects at a single visit 
after which they reverted to NAb negative status at the next time point and remained negative for all 
subsequent study visits. According to the information available, the presence of neutralising antibodies 
in the 3 subjects had no negative impact on the AVG observed. Cross -reactive binding of anti-
vosoritide TAbs to ANP, BNP or CNP in vitro was detected in 30% (47/156), 3% (4/156) or 19% 
(30/156), respectively, of All Treated subjects at one or more visits. However, TAb cross-reactivity was 
not correlated with safety signals in any of the studies. The immunogenicity risk assessment strategy 
in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies includes continuing to closely monitor safety signals associated with 
antibody cross-reactivity to natriuretic peptides. 
In the placebo controlled pivotal trial 111-301 (N=131) the incidence for HAEs was higher in vosoritide 
group (16 [26.7%] subjects with 81 events) compared to placebo (7 [11.5%] subjects with 13 
events). This difference was largely driven by a higher incidence and event rate for injection site 
urticaria in the vosoritide group. Since only moderate 2 Grade events of injection site urticaria were 
observed, both in the same subject treated with vosoritide and all other HAEs were Grade 1 (mild), the 
CHMP assessment report

risk derived from HAEs seems to be moderate and higher compared with that in placebo treated 
subjects. It is reassuring that no Grade 3 or higher events were reported and no subjects experienced 
events meeting NIAID/FAAN criteria for anaphylaxis. The event rates for HAEs in the pooled safety 
population with a significantly longer observation period: 44 (26.8%) of All Treated subjects (N=164) 
is in line with the results of the pivotal trial 111-301. For HAEs with an event rate of 1.54 AEs/person-
year is calculated. In conclusion, the risk for the target population due to HAEs can be assessed as 
mild to moderate, probably also during longer treatment periods as needed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro microsome stability study and CYP inhibition and induction studies were conducted for 
vosoritide. The microsome stability study suggested that CYP-mediated phase I metabolism was not 
the major clearance mechanism for vosoritide. The in vitro CYP inhibition and induction studies 
suggested that vosoritide did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5, nor induce CYP 
1A2, 2B6, or 3A4/5. Based on the results from these studies, CYP mediated drug-drug interactions for 
vosoritide are unlikely. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the main pivotal RCT trial 111-301 two subjects in the active arm discontinued treatment early with 
only 2 and 6 days on treatment (followed by study discontinuation on Study Days 15 and 286, 
respectively). One (1) subject treated with 30 μg/kg due to a Wolff-Parkinson syndrome (Grade 1), 
and 2 subjects treated with 15 μg/kg due to AEs of procedural anxiety (Grade 1) and transaminases 
increased (Grade 2) each.  
In the pooled safety population, 3 (1.8%) subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE. One (1) 
subject treated with 30 μg/kg due to a Wolff-Parkinson syndrome (Grade 1), and 2 subjects treated 
with 15 μg/kg due to AEs of procedural anxiety (Grade 1) and transaminases increased (Grade 2) 
each. With respect to the case of increased transaminase, an independent paediatric hepatologist 
presumed after evaluation that “the event is likely to be attributable to mild hepatitis with a possible 
infectious etiology including parasitic infections, e.g. Toxocara, or community-acquired infections such 
as parvo B19, adeno or hepatitis E virus”. 
Post marketing experience 
Vosoritide is not available as a marketed drug in any country. All data included in this marketing 
application are from clinical studies conducted with vosoritide. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Vosoritide is intended for use in the rare paediatric orphan disease population of Achondroplasia for 
which a frequency of ~1: 25000 is reported. It is acknowledged that the safety evaluation is limited by 
the small size of the database and non-clinical safety data is of particular interest.  
Across all non-clinical toxicology studies, the predominant findings were changes in long bones and 
joints. The most salient effect was impaired function of the hind limbs. This was accompanied by 
morphological changes of tibia, femur and acetabulum, damage of articular cartilage and histological 
alterations in the growth plate, indicating irregular growth of the bone. The latter mainly consisted of 
disordering of the columnar chondrocyte arrangement. It is acknowledged that the bone findings may 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 167/191 
 
 
 
 
be related to exaggerated bone growth and are not expected when the basal growth rate is reduced by 
Ach. The growth rate with vosoritide treatment is not expected be higher than normal (i.e. higher than 
in healthy subjects/animals), such adverse effects are therefore not expected in patients with ACH. 
However, no conclusion can be made in view of the limited human data currently available. Long-term 
safety including skeletal effects is listed as missing information in the RMP, additional information will 
be collected post marketing from the completion of the ongoing long-term studies in ACH patients 
(111-208 and 111-302) and the planned PASS. 
The non-clinical data indicate no significant off-target toxicity of vosoritide (See Discussion on non-
clinical Section 2.3.6. 2.4.4. ). 
Exposure 
Clinical safety data is available from seven interventional studies 111-101 (up to 15 μg/kg vosoritide); 
111-202 (2.5, 7.5, 15 or 30 μg/kg vosoritide); 111-205, 111-206 and 111-208 (15 or 30 μg/kg 
vosoritide), and 111-301 and 111-302 (15 μg/kg vosoritide).  
Safety can be assessed from 164 ACH subjects treated (pooled safety population of all treated 
subjects) of whom 60 were included in the placebo-controlled, double blinded, randomised phase III 
trial 111-301 in subjects in the age range of 5 to < 18 years. With respect to the demographic and 
other baseline factors it is concluded that the population available reflects adequately the characteristic 
of the target population. However, the majority of safety data is derived from the population of 
children between the age of ≥5 and ≤8 years. Data in younger children below the age of ≤5 years at 
the time of treatment start (as well as ≥ 15 years) is very limited and restricted to 8 (or 1) patient. 
This database is too limited to allow a valid conclusion regarding potential differences, even in the 
absence of signals. The use in patients 2 to 5 years old is listed as missing information in the RMP. 
Additional data will be available from the ongoing still blinded randomised study 111-206 (final results 
expected in Q3 2022), which is an imposed condition to the marketing authorisation and from the 
corresponding extension study 111-208 which is a Category 3 study in the RMP. 
A particular strength of vosoritide’s clinical development programme is the availability of placebo-
controlled data. Although this data allows mainly a comparison to placebo only during the first 52 
weeks, longer duration of exposure (≥12 month) was reported for 96 (58.5%) subjects in the pooled 
population. The median duration of exposure (13.7 months), corresponding to 255.13 person-years of 
treatment exposure. Most of the safety data derive from the pivotal trial, while the maximum duration 
of 69.3 months was largely driven by the treatment duration in 111-202/205 studies.  
Overall, it is concluded that the exposure is adequate for the population subjects ≥5 year, as data 
available include also long-term safety outcome. Nevertheless, more robust long-term safety is needed 
considering the long-term treatment duration (probably up to 13 or 18 years of treatment). Long term 
safety including skeletal effects as impaired function of extremities and joints and immunogenic 
potential is listed as missing information in the RMP and additional data will be collected from the 
ongoing and planned pharmacovigilance activities.  
Taking into account the size of the database, rare and unforeseeable safety events can generally not 
be excluded. This will be followed in the routine pharmacovigilance activities including PSUSA 
submission. 
Safety data is available only from the target population since vosoritide was specifically designed to 
treat ACH patients.

Adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled trial 111-301, the incidence of AEs was similar between the vosoritide 
(98.3%) and placebo (98.4%), which may allow to conclude with respect to frequency of AEs that the 
overall toxicity is not significantly increased compared with placebo. The low toxicity of vosoritide seen 
in animals seems also applicable for the human target population. This assumption is further confirmed 
by the observation that most of the adverse events were Grade 1 TEAEs (vosoritide: 96.7 % versus 
placebo: 97.4%) and Grade 3 (severe) TEAEs were less frequent (vosoritide: 5.0% versus placebo: 
4.9%) and overall balanced between the vosoritide and placebo arms. The absence of any grade ≥4 
AEs and deaths indicate also a rather low toxicity. Only one subject discontinued the study treatment 
(vosoritide arm) due to Grade 1 anxiety to injections.  
85% of the TEAEs observed were injection site reactions (ISR), which could be interpreted also at least 
as partially related due to the mode of administration and the need for daily injections. Injection site 
reactions were slightly more frequent in subjects in the vosoritide arm (Vosoritide: 85% / Placebo: 
82%). Nevertheless, the event rates as calculated by dividing the total number of events (m) by the 
total treatment exposure in each treatment group demonstrate that at least some of these TEAEs have 
to be seen drug related (Vosoritide 126.7 versus Placebo: 34.8). Injection site reaction is listed as ADR 
with very common frequency in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Adverse events reported in the pivotal trial 111-301 with a  ≥  5% difference between the vosoritide 
group compared to placebo and in ≥ 5 subjects were: injection site reaction (73.3% versus 47.5%), 
injection site swelling (38.3% versus 9.8%), vomiting (26.7% versus 19.7%), arthralgia (15.0% 
versus 6.6%), injection site urticaria (13.3% versus 3.3%), blood pressure decreased (11.7% versus 
4.9%), diarrhoea (10.0% versus 3.3%), ear pain, and influenza (10.0% versus 4.9% each). 
In the larger pooled safety population, which includes 104 additional patients to those investigated in 
the pivotal trial 111-301, the frequency of the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were 
rather similar: ISR (49.4%), injection site erythema (47.0%), nasopharyngitis (28.7%), injection site 
swelling (24.4%), cough (20.1%), headache (20.1%), pyrexia (23.2%), and vomiting (22.6%). Most 
AEs were Grade 1 (mild) in severity. Assessment of the details did result in the identification of any 
relevant or clinically meaningful difference. In the limited data of subjects received a higher dose of 30 
µ/kg, no evidence is seen for a clear dose dependency of any of these events. 
In the All Treated population, the most common treatment-related AEs reported in ≥ 10% of subjects 
were injection site reaction (48.8%), injection site erythema (47.0%), injection site swelling (24.4%), 
hypotension (11.6%), and injection site urticaria (10.4%). Other treatment related AEs reported in >1 
subject,  apart  from  ISR-related  events,  were  blood  pressure  decreased  (4.9%),  vomiting  (3.0%), 
dizziness (3%), headache (1.8%), fatigue, pre-syncope, and nausea (1.2% each).  
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of vosoritide, injection site reaction and blood pressure are 
identified as adverse reactions of vosoritide.  
The applicant was requested to discuss whether the increased frequency of arthralgia in the vosoritide 
group could be a sign of articular/periarticular inflammation. The applicant pointed out that in Study 
111-301, there was a greater proportion of subjects with pre-existing conditions (mainly tibial bowing 
but also pre-existing knee pain) in the vosoritide group (6/9 subjects) compared to the placebo group 
(1/4 subjects). The condition of tibial bowing itself is likely to promote arthralgia. The applicant 
emphasised that there were no serious or severe events of arthralgia, and that there was no 
discontinuation from treatment due to such an event, no procedural intervention was required, and 
that there was no worsening of events over time. Further, it was stated that there was no meaningful 
difference in the incidence of arthralgia not only during the dose escalation proportion (only one AE of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 169/191 
 
 
 
 
arthralgia reported for the lowest dose level of 2.5 µg/kg/day) of the phase 2 study 111-202, but also 
during the up to 69 months treatment in 111-202/205 (vosoritide: 8/22 [36%], placebo: 3/8 [38%]). 
Additionally, the applicant mentioned that effects related to exaggerated pharmacology might be 
possible in paediatric patients, but this would be expected at higher doses. The CHMP agreed that the 
available data do not suggest exaggerated pharmacology and not to include arthralgia in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
Adverse events of special interest 
According the non-clinical and secondary pharmacology data, injection sites reactions (ISR), blood 
pressure decreases and heart rate changes, hypersensitivity (SMQ narrow terms) and fractures as well 
as slipped capital femoral epiphysis or avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis were defined as adverse 
events of special interest probably related to vosoritide.  
Although similar number of subjects were reported with injection sites reactions in the vosoritide 
(51 (85.0%) subjects) and placebo arm (50 (82.0%) subjects) groups, the total number of events 
reported were higher in the vosoritide group (6983 events with an event rate of 120.4 AEs/person-
year) compared to placebo (1776 events with an event rate of 29.2 AEs/person-year). ISR is identified 
as a drug related adverse event, which could be expected for an active injectable peptide product 
associated with immunisation to some degree over time. However, the grading is reassuring, since 
only 5 Grade 2 (moderate) events were described in the vosoritide arm in two subjects probably 
reflecting immunisation (2 events of injection site urticaria, and 1 event of injection site vesicles while 
further 2 events were summarised as injection site reaction only).  
The majority of ISRs resolved in < 24 hours; those lasting ≥ 24 hours in the vosoritide group compared 
to placebo, were injection site reactions (V:15 versus Plc:6 events) and injection site bruising (V: 15 
versus Plc:10 events).  
Data submitted regarding the pooled safety population seemed to be overall in line with the findings in 
the trial 111-301 population, but due to slightly different mode of reporting, the lower incidence of 53 
% may be less reliable compared with the data from the pivotal RCT. 
In summary, according to the data all ISR events reported during the study were described as 
transient, non-serious, and in the majority as mild, resolving without medical intervention. This finding 
seems to be confirmed by the observation that no subjects discontinued from treatment due to ISR-
related events.  
Consistent with the biological effects of CNP on vascular function (cGMP release) transient decreases in 
DBP could be expected and were observed in the non-clinical studies. Blood pressure decreases 
were described under the most common ADRs reported after ISR (85%) and vomiting (27%). A 
decreased blood pressure was observed in 8 (13.3 %/ 11 events) patients treated with vosoritide 
compared to 3 (4.9%/ 3 events) in the placebo arm of the pivotal trial 111-301. All events were Grade 
1 (mild), and no subject discontinued treatment due to an AE of decrease in BP. A numerically slightly 
higher rate of 28 (17.1%) events is reported in the All Treated Population. However, there were no 
Grade 3 or 4 events, and none of the events were serious or led to discontinuation of study treatment. 
With one exception, the events with BPD were asymptomatic and even in the only symptomatic case 
severity was Grade 1 (post-dose SBP decrease of <20 mmHg/ DBP decrease of <10 mmHg). No 
patients in the whole safety population needed any specific treatment and the only symptomatic 
episode observed was short-lasted (< 5 minutes with dizziness and vomiting after sitting up quickly) 
and self-limiting. It needs to be considered in addition that in orthostatic events other factors as 
hydration status, anxiousness etc. have to be taken into account as hidden cofactors also and may 
have contributed to the symptoms. Moreover, a trend to arterial hypertension is reported in ACH

children. The data indicate a mild risk of blood pressure decrease derived from vosoritide in the target 
population, which resolves spontaneously without treatment needed. Hypotension is listed in Section 
4.8 of the SmPC as ADR with frequency very common and precautions for use to reduce the risk of 
potential blood pressure decrease are included in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The applicant evaluated symptoms that could potentially be associated with blood pressure decrease. 
Fatigue was reported in [6.7%] subjects treated with vosoritide versus none with placebo, nausea 
was reported in 5.0% subjects with vosoritide versus 6.6% subjects with placebo, presyncope was 
reported in 3.3% subjects with vosoritide versus none with placebo, and dizziness was reported in 
6.7% subjects with vosoritide versus 1.6% subject with placebo. Many of these events in the vosoritide 
group occurred at home without corresponding BP measurements, and hence due to the lack of BP 
values at the time of the event, no causality could be associated between these reported AEs with a 
reduction in BP. The adverse reactions of pre-syncope, dizziness and fatigue are considered clinically 
relevant and included as ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Nausea is also included as an ADR as this AE 
was considered as treatment related AE. 
Syncope was added as an ADR based on occurrence of 2 events of syncope in 1 subject (3%) in 
relation to blood draws during the Phase 2 open-label study 111-202 (N = 35); no events of syncope 
were reported in study 111-301. 
Tachycardia was only reported in two subjects in the pooled safety population. No case was reported 
from the pivotal trial. In the two cases in the pooled safety population, no interventions were needed 
and the reasons for the tachycardia remain unknown, in spite of cardiological diagnostic. Non-clinical 
data indicate no increased risk for arrhythmogenic events. 
Since vosoritide is a peptide, immunisation and potential hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE) 
are of special interest with respect to safety. The applicant included adequate investigations of 
immunisation into the clinical trials, which allow a reliable assessment. In the placebo controlled pivotal 
trial 111-301 (N=131) the incidence for HAEs was higher in vosoritide group (16 [26.7%] subjects with 
81 events) compared to placebo (7 [11.5%] subjects with 13 events). This difference was largely 
driven by a higher incidence and event rate for injection site urticaria in the vosoritide group. Since 
only moderate 2 Grade events of injection site urticaria were observed, both in the same subject 
treated with vosoritide and all other HAEs were Grade 1 (mild), the risk derived from HAEs seems to be 
moderate and higher compared with that in placebo treated subjects. The CHMP considered reassuring 
that no Grade 3 or higher events were reported and no subjects experienced events meeting 
NIAID/FAAN criteria for anaphylaxis. The event rates for HAEs in the pooled safety population with a 
significantly longer observation period: 44 (26.8%) of All Treated subjects (N=164) is in line with the 
results of the pivotal trial 111-301. For HAEs with an event rate of 1.54 AEs/person-year is calculated. 
In conclusion, the risk for the target population due to HAEs can be assessed as mild to moderate, 
probably also during longer treatment periods as needed.  
An increased risk for bone and joint malformation probably leading to osteonecrosis and 
cartilage dysfunction was observed in healthy animals. Although the relevance of the observed 
findings in animal for the human ACH target population might be questionable, events like 
spontaneous or fractures due to inadequate trauma are of special interest. Similarly, events indicating 
growth associated impairment of bone and cartilage composition, which may lead to 
avascularnecrosis/osteonecrosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis are relevant. Overall, two 
fractures, both events followed an adequate trauma and did not occur spontaneously, are reported in 
the pooled safety population. Both fractures healed without complications. The events were assessed 
as not related to vosoritide treatment. No events of avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis or slipped 
capital femoral epiphysis occurred in any of the treatment groups. The issue concerns mainly the 
CHMP assessment report

vulnerable population of children below the age of 5 years .. At the end at least in the population > 5 
years of age, there is currently no data-driven evidence that would indicate that the non-clinical 
findings are relevant for the human ACH target population. Further data will be collected in the post 
marketing setting from the ongoing trials and the planned PASS as agreed in the RMP.  
In general, the imaging data available regarding bone-age and bone health seemed to confirm that the 
improvements in growth was not associated with premature bone maturation as assessed by the effect 
of vosoritide on bone age. Similarly, there is currently no evidence of disproportionate skeletal growth, 
accelerated bone age, abnormal bone morphology or negative changes in bone mineral density or 
content with vosoritide treatment over time. 
No deaths occurred in the clinical trials and low rate of SAEs is reported with 10 SAEs in 9 subjects 
across all Phase 2 and 3 vosoritide studies. Three (3 (5.0%)) subjects in the pivotal RCT 111-301 
experienced 4 SAEs in the Vosoritide group compared with 4 (6.6%) subjects, who experienced 5 SAEs 
in the placebo group. None of these events was assessed as drug-related. 
Similar TEAE events and rates were observed also in the updated safety data from the ongoing trial 
111-302, particularly in the newly exposed former placebo population from 111-301. 
Laboratory parameters as adverse events 
With respect to the haematological parameter in the laboratory AEs, slight differences between 
vosoritide and placebo were noted in favour for placebo. Decreased WBC and decreased neutrophils in 
a number of patients on vosoritide compared to placebo are reported. However, it is acknowledged 
that the majority of shifts that occurred were self-limiting, resolved on or before the next scheduled 
visit and no haematotoxicity was described in the animal studies. Therefore, these findings are 
considered unlikely to indicate a safety risk of vosoritide.  
In the phase III trial, more Grade 1 Alkaline phosphatase increased measurements were reported in 
the vosoritide group (n=10, 16.7%) compared to placebo (n=4, 6.6%). The applicant argues that this 
was driven by increase in the bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) which is consistent with the 
expected effect of vosoritide on bone growth due to increased chondrocyte and osteoblast activity. 
Upon the CHMP’s request, the applicant agreed to include alkaline phosphatase increase as adverse 
reaction in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Neither in the pivotal trial 111-301 nor in the pooled safety population clinically meaningful changes in 
the mean values for the other clinical chemistry parameters over time were identified with respect to 
vosoritide. According the data no clinically significant changes in any chemistry parameters at any time 
in the total study population is reported. CNP activity is not specific to bone growth. Both CNP and its 
target receptor are ubiquitous in the human body and CNP is present in the brain and in seminal 
plasma. The physiological effects of CNP include also regulations of neuronal development/morphology 
and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The applicant summarised, as requested by 
the CHMP, the current knowledge regarding the impact of vosoritide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis; there was no evidence in animals that steroid synthesis or the level of other hormones 
may be relevantly impacted by vosoritide. This is further supported by the biodistribution studies which 
demonstrated that vosoritide does not cross the BBB (0,3%) in animals. Similarly, the limited data 
indicate no delay in puberty in treated subjects compared with those who received placebo. No safety 
signal was identified from the data available.  
Subgroup analyses were not performed in trial 111-301 and only presented for the pooled safety 
population (All Treated pooled group), which is acceptable to the CHMP. In these restricted analyses 
differences in a limited population of 164 patients, safety outcome regarding sex, race/ethnicity groups 
and geographical regions did not to indicate any reliable difference.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 172/191 
 
 
 
 
Safety data in ACH subjects below the age of 5 years is restricted to 8 patients only. The safety profile 
in these younger children appears similar to older children, however, no reliable conclusions can be 
drawn at present. Overall, in the small orphan population the reliability of subgroup analyses may be 
challenged in general. The use in patients 2 to 5 years old is listed as missing information in the RMP. 
Additional data will be available from the ongoing trial(s) 111-206/208 in accordance with the agreed 
RMP.  
Immunisation 
Since vosoritide is a peptide, immunisation and potential hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE) are of 
special interest. The effect of anti-vosoritide antibodies was evaluated in the context of reported 
ISRs, HAEs, and safety impact associated with cross-reactive antibodies. Across the study anti-drug 
antibodies, responses were detected in approximately 34% to 63% of subjects across studies with the 
incidence being 38% (59/156) in the All Treated population. Neutralising antibodies (NAb) were 
detected in 2% (3/156) of All Treated subjects at a single visit after which they reverted to NAb 
negative status at the next time point and remained negative for all subsequent study visits. According 
the information available the presence of neutralising antibodies in the 3 subjects had no negative 
impact on the AVG observed.  
In general, it is agreed that the limited immunogenicity results currently available did not indicate a 
high risk from immunogenicity-caused complications. Nevertheless, this risk exists and uncertainty 
remains regarding the overall impact on risk burden associated with vosoritide treatment.  
The applicant has presented two in-vitro studies to investigate the potential for drug-drug 
interaction. Both studies did not indicate the potential for induction or inhibition of the cytochromes 
investigated. The potential for transporter mediated interactions, however, has obviously not been 
addressed. Since the product is parenterally administered no interactions due to food on PK has to be 
taken into account. 
In addition, vosoritide is described to have no known potential for drug abuse. No studies were 
conducted to investigate the effect of withdrawal or rebound. 
Discontinuation or treatment interruption due to adverse events 
In the pooled safety population 3 (1.8%) subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE. 1 subject 
treated with 30 μg/kg due to a Wolff-Parkinson syndrome (Grade 1), and 2 subjects treated with 15 
μg/kg due to AEs of procedural anxiety (Grade 1) and transaminases increased (Grade 2) each. With 
respect to the case of increased transaminase, which was extensively investigated, it is acknowledged 
that an independent paediatric hepatologist presumed after evaluation that “the event is likely to be 
attributable to mild hepatitis with a possible infectious aetiology including parasitic infections, e.g. 
Toxocara, or community-acquired infections such as parvo B19, adeno or hepatitis E virus”. Moreover, 
the non-clinical trials did not indicate vosoritide-related effects on the liver in monkeys or rats treated 
with vosoritide daily for up to 44 or 26 weeks, respectively. Insofar, at least the nonclinical findings do 
not raise any important safety concerns pertaining to hepatotoxicity for the human use. After receiving 
the applicant’s response, the uncertainty regarding this finding seems further reduced.  
The proportion of subjects experiencing AEs and SAEs that led to study drug interruption was 
balanced between the vosoritide (10 [16.7%] and 2 [3.3%] subjects, respectively) and placebo (10 
[16.4%] and 2 [3.3%] subjects, respectively) groups. Thus, it may be seen as an additional 
confirmation that vosoritide’s safety risk profile is mild and differences observed regarding the types of 
some adverse events are explained by the pharmacological effects of the product sufficiently.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
There is no data regarding the use of vosoritide during pregnancy. The proposed use of vosoritide is 
limited to the paediatric population and pregnancy testing was included in the study as well as 
recommendations for contraception in fertile and sexually active adolescent patients. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. However, as a 
precautionary measure, in section 4.6 of the SmPC states that it is preferable to avoid the use of 
vosoritide during pregnancy.  
Voxzogo has a moderate influence on the ability to drive, cycle and use machines. Vosoritide may 
cause transient decreases in blood pressure that are usually mild but syncope, pre-syncope, dizziness, 
as well as other signs and symptoms of decreased blood pressure have been reported as adverse 
reactions. The patient’s response to treatment should be considered and if appropriate, advised not to 
drive, cycle or use machines for at least 60 minutes after injection. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Vosoritide has an acceptable safety profile and treatment is generally well tolerated from the available 
clinical development safety data. The safety profile in animals is rather similar to that observed in the 
human population. No signal for additional safety risk in human was identified during the clinical 
development.  
The main adverse reactions identified during the clinical development are related to injection site 
reactions, blood pressure decrease, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and increased alkaline phosphatase. 
However, long-term safety risk, particularly risk for bone and joint malformation probably leading to 
osteonecrosis and cartilage dysfunction after longer treatment durations cannot fully be assessed at 
present. The available data did not indicate that the improvements in growth is associated with any 
detectable premature bone maturation, disproportionate skeletal growth or abnormal bone 
morphology. Moreover, there was no evidence suggestive of any off-target effects including renal or 
CNS. 
The limited immunogenicity results currently available did not indicate a high risk from 
immunogenicity-caused complications. Nevertheless, this risk exists and uncertainty regarding 
potential long-term outcome remains.   
The applicant applies for the treatment of ACH children above the age of 2 years. However, currently 
safety in the population of children with ACH in the age of between 2 to 5 years can be only assessed 
from 4 sentinel patients. Although exposure in the now presented updated safety report was 
significantly higher and the preliminary data presented seems to indicate no differences regarding the 
observed adverse events and safety risks from the pivotal trials 111-206/208, the reliability of 
conclusion based on this data is limited. In order to overcome this limitation, the ongoing clinical trial 
111-206 is proposed as a category 1 study to collect further efficacy and safety data in the population 
of 2 to 5 years old. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- Long term safety including skeletal effects as impaired function of extremities and joints and 
immunogenic potential is a missing information in the RMP. Additional data will be collected post-

marketing from the ongoing long-term studies (111-205 / 111-208 / 111-302) and the planned PASS, 
which are classified as Category 3. 
- Use in patients 2 to 5 years is a missing information in the RMP. Additional information will be 
collected from the ongoing study 111-206 which is imposed as a condition to the marketing 
authorisation and from 2 additional Category 3 studies (ongoing long-term study 111-208 and planned 
PASS).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that vosoritide has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers vosoritide to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
CHMP assessment report

2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found partly acceptable by the QRD group. In particular, the 
QRD group agreed to an English only vial label. The Group accepted the justification submitted 
regarding, mainly, the low patient numbers anticipated within individual Member States and the 
technical restrictions due to the small size of the containers (2 mL). 
In regards to the outer carton, no consensus was reached, considering that the product will be used by 
caregiver/patient, and bearing in mind that the numbers of patients anticipated per Member State 
were not low. The Group agreed, that, as a first option, the applicant should explore a multilingual 
outer carton, with the possibility of revisiting this in the future. If an agreement cannot be reached, it 
was concluded that the applicant would need to approach Member States individually.  It was also 
agreed that the solvent label would need to be in the national language, in DE at least. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will, however, be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Voxzogo (vosoritide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Achondroplasia (ACH) is a rare genetical orphan disease disorder with an incidence of 1 in 25,000 
births. ACH is the most common form of short-limbed short stature and is characterised by rhizomelic 
shortening of the extremities, characteristic facies with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia and 
increased lumbar lordosis. The vast majority of individuals with achondroplasia are diagnosed in early 
infancy or at birth, although prenatal recognition has become more frequent. 
Dysmorphic short stature is the obvious main feature of the disease. Although length at birth may be 
normal, slow growth is evident shortly thereafter. Moderate to marked short stature is present in all 
affected individuals. In adult males, average height is about 130 cm with a range from around 120 to 
145 cm. Similarly, in females average height is 125 cm with a range of 115 to 137 cm. 
The disease causes or is associated with obvious orthopaedic complications with about 50% of the 
patients suffering from kyphosis and scoliosis, a potential for osteoarthritis and osteopenia. 
Development of craniocervical stenosis is also common. Based on the skeletal abnormalities, there is a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 178/191 
 
 
 
 
high occurrence of neurological complications and symptoms with chronic back pain affecting up to 
70% of the patients, hydrocephalus and spinal stenosis (increasing with age) and its sequelae. Patients 
regularly suffer from obesity, including abdominal obesity. Based on the craniofacial bone 
abnormalities, patients also suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea, and middle ear dysfunction. 
Strabismus and voice abnormalities are also common. 
The disease is associated with an increased mortality in adult patients (some studies even stating 
increased mortality in childhood) with an estimated mean disadvantage in life expectancy by 10 years, 
with the main causes of death being heart disease, neurological complications, and accidents. 
The disorder is caused by gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 
which is a negative regulator of longitudinal bone growth. All instances of achondroplasia arise from 
mutations that are autosomal dominant. These mutations are fully penetrant and show only modest 
variability of expression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatments for ACH are mainly limited to surgical interventions, including cervico-medullary 
decompression for foramen magnum stenosis and laminectomy surgery for spinal canal stenosis, and 
medical devices such as thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis.  
Furthermore, while supportive care options are available to assist with activities of daily living via the 
use of adaptive devices, many young patients choose to undergo invasive limb-lengthening procedures 
with prolonged recovery as an attempt to ameliorate disproportionate short stature.  
While as much as 15 to 30 cm gain in standing height can be achieved, limb lengthening remains a 
controversial, long and arduous process. It is performed rarely in the US and with varied frequency in 
the EU. Growth hormone (GH) has been used in several different studies in subjects with ACH to 
improve their height. While there is some evidence that growth can be accelerated in the short-term 
(12-24 months) with GH, the long-term treatment benefit is minimal. GH is not approved in the EU for 
treating ACH and is rarely used by paediatric endocrinologists for this condition. Therefore, a clear 
unmet medical need for the condition can be stated. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has provided a comprehensive clinical data package with results from 7 prospective 
clinical studies in genetically confirmed ACH subjects: [111-101-FIM, healthy volunteers only], 111-
202(+111-205) dose-finding, 111-301 (+111-302) pivotal phase 3 RCT (≥5-≤18 years) and 111-
206 (+111-208) pivotal phase 2 RCT (0-≤5 years). In order to optimise disease characterisation of 
the untreated population at baseline and for further comparisons of the short and long-term outcome, 
the applicant has performed one observational study (111-901) and generated RWE from different NH 
sources.  
All patients in the clinical programme were initially included in the baseline observational growth study 
for at least 6 months before they could be recruited for one of three studies (and their corresponding 
extension trials): 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 179/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a.)  Dose-finding: 
Study 111-202 was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 2 study which included 34 ACH subjects at 
the age range of 5-14 years of age, who received vosoritide daily in doses of 2.5µg, 7.5µg, 15µg and 
30µg s.c. in 4 sequential cohorts of at least 8 subjects. Duration was 6 months, with an optional 
treatment extension of 18 months. Type I error was adequately controlled by hierarchical testing. 
After reaching the end of 24 months treatment in trial 111-202, the 30 subjects could be rolled over 
to the long-term extension study 111-205. In this, subjects are followed until reaching near final 
adult height (NFAH) or a minimum of 5 years. Subjects in the low dose cohorts were transferred after 
completion of 202 into the 15 µg/kg dose cohort to increase the information about the selected 
posology. 
b.)  Pivotal trial(s) for subjects from 5 to <18 years of age: 
Study 111-301 is a completed multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks of treatment with vosoritide (15 μg/kg daily) 
compared with placebo in children aged 5 to <18 years with a clinical diagnosis of ACH confirmed by 
genetic testing. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by sex and Tanner stage (Tanner stage 1, or 
Tanner stage >1), with no more than 20% of Tanner stage>1 to be enrolled. A total of 121 subjects 
were enrolled into the study; 61 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and 60 subjects to 
receive daily vosoritide 15 μg/kg. After 52 weeks of treatment, all 61 subjects in the placebo group 
completed the study and in the vosoritide group, 58 subjects completed and 2 subjects withdrew from 
the study.  All subjects were transferred to the extension trial 111-302, in which patients are 
treated with vosoritide until they either attains NFAH or a minimum of 5 years. NFAH was defined as 
evidence of growth plate closure and 6-month interval AGV < 1.5 cm/year AGV or for 5 years, if NFAH 
occurs prior to the end of the 5-year period.  
c.)  Pivotal trial(s) for subjects from 0 to 60 months of age: 
Study 111-206 is an ongoing 52-week multicentre, phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical study. The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and 
its impact on growth in infants and younger children recruited from birth to 60 months (5 years) of 
age with genetically confirmed ACH. Subjects are or will be enrolled into three age cohorts based on 
age [Cohort 1: ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥ 30) / Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to < 24 months (n ≥ 20 ) / Cohort 3: 0 
to < 6 months (n: ≥ 20)] starting with the eldest population. Subjects in the extension trial 111-208 
will receive vosoritide until they reach final or near final height. However, this trial was started in June 
2018 and is still ongoing. Only 11 sentinel patients could be evaluated regarding efficacy and safety; 
they were transferred to the extension trial 208. Since the trial is still ongoing and blinded, efficacy 
in children between 2 and 5 years of age is available for 4 sentinel subjects in this population. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
In ACH subjects > 5 years of age 52 weeks of treatment with vosoritide 15 μg/kg daily in study 
111-301 resulted in a highly statistically significant improvement in AGV vs placebo (LSM change 
from baseline 1.57 cm/year, (95% CI 1.22, 1.93, with a two-sided p<0.0001). This represents 
restoration of a substantial proportion of the estimated 2 cm/year AGV deficit observed between 
children with ACH and those with average stature in this age range. The positive effect on AGV 
appears to be consistent in all sub-groups according the available subgroup analyses. Updated 
results (cut-off 02. Nov 2020) from all 117/121 subjects who were continuing in the study until 
the latest data cut-off had at least an additional 52-weeks of treatment with vosoritide and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 180/191 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
demonstrated consistent improvement in AGV observed at 52 weeks (mean AGV 5.67 cm/year) and 
after 104 weeks (mean AGV 5.64 cm/year).  
In ACH subjects > 5 years of age improvements in AGV resulted also in improvements in height Z-
score after one year of treatment. Subjects treated with vosoritide in trial 111-301 showed a highly 
statistically significant improvement in height Z-score (referenced to average growth of health 
children) compared with those treated with placebo [LS mean difference of +0.28 SDS (CI 0.17, 
0.39, p <0.0001)]. Improvement in height was also observed when compared to ACH specific 
growth curves. 
The maintenance of positive effect on AGV is also indicated by a continuous improvement in height 
Z-score, with a change from baseline of +0.24 SDS after 52 weeks of treatment and to +0.45 SDS 
after 104 weeks of treatment. Improvement in the upper to lower body segment ratio was also 
observed, with a change from baseline of -0.03 after 52 weeks and -0.09 after 104 weeks of 
treatment. Furthermore, the treatment effect continued to be maintained beyond 2 years as 
observed for 14 subjects with 130 weeks on-treatment data with vosoritide. 
• 
Efficacy of vosoritide was also confirmed in subjects that switched from placebo to vosoritide in 
study 111-302. One-year on vosoritide treatment data in these patients showed a similar 
improvement in growth velocity as those patients originally randomised to vosoritide and treated for 
one year in study 111-301. 
•  A sustained positive effect on AGV was observed in patients treated up to 5 years with vosoritide 
leading to a cumulative improvement in standing height of over 9 cm compared to an age- and sex-
matched natural history population suggesting that the growth promoting effect of vosoritide is 
maintained over time.  
• 
• 
The sustained acceleration in linear growth is illustrated by the change in trajectory of growth 
curves towards the reference height distribution of average stature children.  
The durability of vosoritide effect on skeletal growth is also supported by a sustained increase in 
CXM, a highly specific marker of endochondral ossification confirming continuing effect of vosoritide 
on growth plates over time. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Data on long-term efficacy is limited. However, all 117/121 subjects ≥ 5 years of age who were 
continuing in the study at the most recent data cut-off had at least an additional 52-weeks of 
treatment with vosoritide. 
• 
The improvement in linear growth was not associated with an undue increase in bone maturation. 
This is important since an acceleration of bone maturation would decrease the expected final height 
gain.  
•  Although, 24 month data from 4 sentinel subjects aged 2 to <5 years suggest consistent 
improvement in growth, the placebo-controlled phase III study 111- 206 (and the extension 
study 111-208) are still ongoing and therefore no results are currently available on the 
randomised groups. The efficacy in this patient subgroup is further supported by extrapolation of 
the efficacy demonstrated in patients 5 years and above since the same underlying pathophysiology 
applies to all age groups and vosoritide acts as a disease modifier the same way across all age 
groups. In addition, vosoritide pharmacology with bone-specific biomarker response has shown time 
course and pattern of changes in younger children consistent with changes seen in the older 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 181/191 
 
 
 
 
children treated with vosoritide. However, since uncertainties remain in children 2 to 5 years of age, 
the ongoing study 111-206 in this subgroup is important for the collection of additional efficacy 
data and final results will be submitted post-marketing as a condition to the marketing 
authorisation. 
•  Although the dose finding regarding the 15 μg/kg daily dose seems to be adequately justified in 
children above age of 2 years, it is unclear whether a higher dose of 30 µg (investigated currently in 
study 111-206) would be more adequate in younger children. This will be addressed when final 
results from the ongoing study 111-206 which is imposed as a condition to the marketing 
authorisation are submitted. 
•  Although, in ACH subjects ≥ 5 years of age the positive effect on AGV as well as Height Z-score 
appears to be consistent in all sub-groups according to the available subgroup analyses, 
interpretation of results in small subgroups remains uncertain. However, based on 
biological/mechanistic considerations, vosoritide is expected to exert favourable effects in all 
patients with ACH as long as their growth plates are open, although the benefit in young patients 
with a higher growth potential is likely greater than in older children.      
• 
The limited long-term data do not indicate any deterioration and in fact suggest a favourable impact 
on upper to lower body segment ratio, since in some patients treated for over 5 years a trend for a 
small numerical improvement was observed. From the general growth characteristics in ACH, a 
potentially more pronounced improvement may be expected in children below the age of 5. 
However, data available are not robust enough to confirm this assumption. Data will be provided on 
height velocity, standing height, height Z-score changes, and upper to lower body segment ratios 
from the ongoing studies 111-205 and 111-302, which are Category 3 studies in the agreed 
RMP. 
• 
The impact of vosoritide treatment on QoL evaluation in the pivotal study 111-301 remains 
uncertain, since the data available indicate no change in comparison to placebo. Further information 
on this individually important, but regulatory not decisive information may become available from 
the ongoing studies post-marketing. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The safety profile observed in the vosoritide clinical development programme appears rather 
benign. As far as currently known, there have been no important risks associated with vosoritide. 
All SAEs observed during the clinical trial programme were confirmed to be not drug related and 
no unexpected safety signal were observed across the studies. 
In the placebo-controlled study 111-301, the incidence of AEs was similar between the vosoritide 
(98.3%) and placebo (98.4%), therefore, with respect to frequency of AEs, the overall toxicity is 
not significantly increased compared with placebo. The low toxicity of vosoritide seen in animals 
seems also be applicable for the human target population.  
The overwhelming majority of the events were Grade 1 TEAEs (vosoritide: 96.7 % versus placebo: 
97.4%).  Grade 3 (severe) TEAEs were less frequent (vosoritide: 5.0% versus placebo: 4.9%) and 
overall balanced. No grade ≥4 AEs or deaths were observed in the clinical programme. 
Adverse events reported more frequently in the pivotal trial 111-301 with a ≥  5% difference 
between the vosoritide group compared to placebo and in ≥ 5 subjects were injection site reaction 
(73.3% versus 47.5%), injection site swelling (38.3% versus 9.8%), vomiting (26.7% versus 
19.7%), arthralgia (15.0% versus 6.6%), injection site urticaria (13.3% versus 3.3%), blood 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021

• 
• 
• 
pressure decreased (11.7% versus 4.9%), diarrhoea (10.0% versus 3.3%), ear pain, and 
influenza (10.0% versus 4.9% each). 
Pharmacodynamically reasoned adverse events of injection site reaction and blood pressure are 
considered related to vosoritide. 
The incidence rates of injection site reactions were increased with vosoritide as were the event 
rates (total number of events (m)/total treatment exposure in each treatment group), which 
identifies that the majority of these TEAEs are seen as drug related (Vosoritide 126.7 versus 
Placebo: 34.8). However, the vast majority of injection sites reactions were of mild severity and 
only 5 were Grade 2 (moderate) events in the vosoritide arm. 
A decreased blood pressure was observed in 8 (13.3%/ 11 events) patients treated with vosoritide 
compared to 3 (4.9%/ 3 events) in the placebo arm of the pivotal trial 111-301. All events were 
Grade 1 (mild), and no subject discontinued treatment due to an AE of decrease in BP. A 
numerically slightly higher rate of 28 (17.1%) events is reported in the All Treated Population. 
However, there were no Grade 3 or 4 events, and none of the events were serious or led to 
discontinuation of study treatment or needed of medical intervention even during long term 
exposure. 
• 
The following symptoms that could potentially be associated with blood pressure decrease 
occurred at a higher frequency in the vosoritide group than the placebo group. Fatigue (6.7% 
subjects treated with vosoritide versus none with placebo), nausea (5.0% subjects with 
vosoritide versus 6.6% subjects with placebo), presyncope (3.3% subjects with vosoritide versus 
none with placebo), and dizziness (6.7% subjects with vosoritide versus 1.6% subject with 
placebo). However, no causality could be associated between these reported AEs with a reduction 
in BP, they are therefore considered as adverse reactions to vosoritide. 
• 
• 
Anti-drug antibody responses were detected in approximately 34% to 63% of subjects across 
studies with the incidence being 38% (59/156) in the All Treated population. NAb were detected in 
2% (3/156) of All Treated subjects at a single visit after which they reverted to NAb negative 
status at the next time point and remained negative for all subsequent study visits. According the 
information available, the presence of neutralising antibodies in the 3 subjects had no negative 
impact on the AVG observed. 
Since vosoritide is a peptide and immunisation was frequently observed in the pooled safety 
population, hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE) are a risk associated with vosoritide. The 
incidence for HAEs was higher in vosoritide group (16 [26.7%] subjects with 81 events) compared 
to placebo (7 [11.5%] subjects with 13 events). This difference was largely driven by a higher 
incidence and event rate for injection site urticaria in the vosoritide group. Since only moderate 2 
Grade events of injection site urticaria were observed, both in the same subject treated with 
vosoritide and all other HAEs were Grade 1 (mild), the risk derived from HAEs, although higher 
compared with that in placebo treated subjects, appears to be moderate. No Grade 3 or higher 
events were reported and no subjects experienced events meeting NIAID/FAAN criteria for 
anaphylaxis also in the currently available updated safety data.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
The majority of safety data is derived from the population of children between the age of 5 and 18 
years. Data in younger children below the age of 5 years at the time of treatment start (as well as 
≥ 15 years) is very limited and restricted to 8 (or 11) patient. No safety signals have been

detected in these patients, but additional data will be collected post-marketing. Additional 
information in patients 2 to 5 years will be collected from the ongoing study 111-206 which is 
imposed as a condition to the marketing authorisation and from 2 additional Category 3 studies 
(ongoing long-term study 111-208 and planned PASS). 
• 
Information is currently missing to address the long-term safety including skeletal effects as 
impaired function of extremities and joints and immunogenic potential:  
o  Although currently no relevant long-term risks with vosoritide were identified from the 
safety data in the pooled population, it needs to be considered that long-term 
experience is still limited. A total of 56 subjects have so far been treated for at least 2 
years (initially randomised to vosoritide in 111-301), and an additional 61 subjects for 
1 year (initially randomised to placebo in study 111-301.  
o  An increased risk for bone and joint malformation probably leading to osteonecrosis 
and cartilage dysfunction was observed in non-clinical studies in healthy animals. No 
event of avascular necrosis/osteonecrosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis was 
observed in children until data cut-off. The only bone related events beside arthralgia 
were two fractures, both following an adequate trauma and not considered related to 
vosoritide treatment. Although the undue effects of vosoritide observed in healthy 
animals are probably not fully relevant in the human target population, potential 
adverse long-term effects of vosoritide on the skeleton remains an uncertainty.  
o  Although the limited immunogenicity results currently available as well as the absence 
of subjects with anaphylaxis do not indicate a high risk from immunogenicity-caused 
adverse reactions, uncertainty remains.  
o  Therefore, additional data will be collected post-marketing from the ongoing long-term 
studies (111-205 / 111-208 / 111-302) and the planned PASS, which are classified as 
Category 3. 
• 
There is no data regarding the use of vosoritide during pregnancy. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. However, as a precautionary 
measure, the SmPC section 4.6 states that it is preferable to avoid the use of vosoritide during 
pregnancy.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Subjects with ACH have markedly reduced and disproportionate short stature resulting in physical 
disability and potential complications such as hydrocephalus or spinal cord compression. Considering 
that the rarely used treatment option of surgical limb lengthening remains a controversial, long and 
potentially dangerous procedure and has no impact on the other comorbidities resulting from impaired 
endochondral bone formation in ACH subjects, a high medical need for an alternative treatment can be 
confirmed. Vosoritide is the first targeted therapy for children with ACH which can, at least partially, 
correct the consequences of the underlying pathophysiological defect by downregulating the FGFR3 
signaling in chondrocytes. 
Vosoritide has been shown to be efficacious in ACH children from 5 to <18 years of age. Data from the 
pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 study 111-301/302, together with the available long-term data in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 186/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study 202/205, demonstrate a consistent statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement 
in longitudinal growth. Results are robust as indicated by a consistent outcome for the key secondary 
endpoints Height Z-Scores as well as standing height. A least squared (LS) mean difference of 1.57 
cm/year in AGV (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22, 1.93, two-sided p <0.0001) is assessed as an 
important clinical benefit in the target population since it restores a significant proportion of the 
estimated 2 cm/year AGV deficit observed between children with ACH and healthy children with normal 
growth. Moreover, the effect appears to be maintained over time and could result in a substantial 
cumulative increase in final height, esp. since vosoritide does not appear to accelerate bone 
maturation. About 75% of the normal growth in the corresponding age could be reached in a best-case 
scenario.  
Such a degree of improvement in height may allow persons with ACH to perform daily activities taken 
for granted in an average height world, this is considered to be an important benefit.  
In addition, a small favourable effect on body proportions was noted, but it is acknowledged that 
significantly longer treatment periods may be needed to confirm a benefit for patients. Further data 
will be collected post-marketing to address this issue from the ongoing studies 111-205 and 111-
302, which are Category 3 studies in the agreed RMP. 
Although improvement of daily-life activities are known to impact the quality of life, potentially more 
obvious in the adolescence than in childhood, the quality of life data from study 111-301 remain 
inconclusive. The young age of the patients and the rather short placebo-controlled observation period 
may explain this finding.    
Although currently available data suggest that the treatment effect of vosoritide is maintained, longer 
term data confirming that final height can indeed be meaningfully increased will be available from the 
ongoing long term studies (studies 111-205 and 111-302), which are Category 3 studies in the 
agreed RMP.  
While efficacy in ACH patients aged 5 years and older has clearly been demonstrated, data for subjects 
in the age range 2 to <5 years from the pivotal RCTs 111-206/208 is currently very limited. Although, 
the 130-weeks growth data on 4 sentinel subjects from this study are considered promising, the 
number of subjects remains small. It is nevertheless fully acknowledged that starting treatment as 
soon as possible may be important to achieve optimal effects on final height and potentially other 
complications of ACH, and the applicant further justified the efficacy in patients 2 to 5 years by 
extrapolation of the efficacy established in children above 5 years of age. The extrapolation is based on 
the same underlying pathophysiology, vosoritide mechanism of action across all age groups and PD 
data from the ongoing study 111-206 that have shown a similar increase of CXM, which is related to 
growth rate, for the younger and the older subgroups. Thus, it is agreed that the scientific 
argumentation and the provided PD data further support the extrapolation of efficacy from the older to 
the younger patients. However, since uncertainties remain in children 2 to 5 years of age, the ongoing 
study 111-206 in this subgroup is important for the collection of additional efficacy data and final 
results will be submitted post-marketing. 
From the safety assessment it is concluded that vosoritide has an acceptable safety profile and 
treatment is generally well tolerated. There have been no important safety risks identified associated 
with vosoritide at present. The majority of AEs were Grade 1 (mild) and no unexpected safety findings 
were observed. No life-threatening or fatal AEs were reported, and no participants discontinued from 
treatment as a result of an adverse reaction. Insofar, the low toxicity observed in animals seems to be 
similar to that observed in the human population. No signal for any additional safety risk in human 
became obvious during the clinical development. Moreover, there was no evidence suggestive of any 
off-target effects including renal or CNS.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 187/191 
 
 
 
 
Although the absence of significant toxicities is encouraging, it should be taken into account that the 
safety database is numerically limited (due to the rarity of the disease) and that assessment of 
younger ACH children (<5 years of age) is even more limited. However, it is important to note that at 
the time of update no new safety signal was detected even after significantly longer exposure. 
Daily injections were generally well-tolerated in the Phase 2 and 3 studies for up to 5.8 years (69.3 
months) as indicated by the absence of any < grade 3 adverse events during the clinical trial. Insofar, 
injection site reactions were the most common treatment related events, with transient injection site 
erythema and injection site wheal and flare being the most common reactions observed. Since 
vosoritide needs to be taken once daily subcutaneous injected this may be a tolerability issue but does 
not mean an important risk for the target population. 
Due to the biological effects of CNP on vascular function, transient decreases in diastolic BP, that were 
mostly asymptomatic and self-limiting, were observed as the second most frequent adverse event. 
Since grade ≥2 DBP event were rare and none of the subjects included in the clinical trials needed any 
specific treatment for this adverse event, this adverse event is not considered as an important and 
significant safety risk. 
At present, there is no signal that the improvements in growth is associated with any detectable 
premature bone maturation, disproportionate skeletal growth or abnormal bone morphology. However, 
potential long-term risks, particularly regarding bone and joint malformation that could lead to 
osteonecrosis and cartilage dysfunction after longer treatment durations is not fully evaluable at 
present. This seems to be the most important uncertainty regarding safety assessment. Long term 
safety will be further characterised in the post-marketing setting from the ongoing long-term studies 
(111-205 / 111-208 / 111-302) and the planned PASS, which are classified as Category 3. 
Since vosoritide is a peptide, immunogenicity and potential hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE) are 
of special interest. The limited immunogenicity results currently available did not indicate a risk from 
immunogenicity-caused complications, but anti-drug antibodies were detected with an incidence of 
38% (59/156) in the pooled (all Treated) population. Neutralising antibodies (NAb) were detected in 
only 2% (3/156) of the same population, probably transient, and had no negative impact on growth. 
This is reassuring but, in principle, the risk for anaphylactic reactions exists and uncertainty remains. 
Immunogenic potential will also be further characterised as part of the long-term studies (111-205 / 
111-208 / 111-302) and the planned PASS.  
The applicant applies for a label in the treatment of children with ACH above the age of 2 years. 
Although clinical data in patients < 5 years of age are very limited, the efficacy results are encouraging 
and the safety profile appears similar to that observed in older children. The efficacy in this patient 
subgroup is further supported by the established efficacy in patients 5 years and older. Since early 
treatment intervention is likely necessary to achieve maximum treatment benefit, the inclusion of 
patients from age 2 years in the indication is agreed to. However, the ongoing pivotal study 111-206 is 
important for the collection of additional efficacy and safety data and to address the remaining 
uncertainties. Therefore, provision of final results from study 111-206 is imposed as a condition to the 
marketing as indicated in the Annex IID of the marketing authorisation.           
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Vosoritide targets directly the pathodynamics of the underlying genetic abnormality in ACH and 
therefore the treatment of ACH with vosoritide has a strong mechanistic rationale. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/397108/2021  
Page 188/191 
 
 
 
 
Vosoritide has shown a statistically significant, robust and clinically relevant growth-promoting effect in 
children with ACH in the age range 5 to 18 years that appears to be maintained long-term without 
acceleration of bone maturation. 
The applicant estimated that, in a best-case scenario, about 75% of the normal growth in the 
corresponding age could be restored which could lead to a significant improvement in final height and 
potentially in body proportions and other features and complications of ACH. However, further long-
term data will need to be generated post-marketing to verify such benefits. 
The safety profile of vosoritide appears rather benign and so far, no serious risks have been identified. 
Therefore, the B/R relationship is clearly positive in children ≥ 5 years of age with ACH. 
Clinical data in ACH children age 2 to < 5 years are very limited. The observed effects from the 130-
weeks growth data in 4 sentinel subjects from study 111-206/208 in ACH children in the age range 
between 2 to < 5 years are promising and the safety profile seems similar to the older age group. The 
efficacy in this patient subgroup is further supported by the similar PD (CXM) responses and the shared 
disease mechanism across age groups in addition to the identification of an acceptable dosage based 
on PK modelling. It is also acknowledged that starting treatment as soon as possible may be important 
to achieve optimal effects on final height and potentially other complications of ACH. Nevertheless, 
results from the ongoing study 111-206 are necessary to address the remaining uncertainties in the 
youngest patients. Therefore, provision of final results from study 111-206 is imposed as a condition to 
the marketing authorisation.

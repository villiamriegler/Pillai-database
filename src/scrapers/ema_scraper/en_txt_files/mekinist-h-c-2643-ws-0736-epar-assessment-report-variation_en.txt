2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
RAF, MEK1 and MEK2 are proteins in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (i.e., the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase [MAPK] pathway)  which is a critical proliferation pathway involved in normal cellular functions as 
well  as  in  many  human  cancers,  relating  to  regulation  of  cell  proliferation.  The  pathway  affects  many 
cancers,  in  particular  melanoma  where  BRAF  mutations  are  present  in  50%  of  melanoma1.  The  most 
frequently  observed  BRAF  mutation  in  melanoma  was  shown  to  be  V600  (74-90%)2  .  Oncogenic 
mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.

There  are  currently  two  small  molecule  inhibitors  of  BRAFV600  (Zelboraf  and  Tafinlar)  and  one  small 
molecule  inhibitor  of  MEK  (Mekinist)  that  have  been  approved.  Both  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  are 
currently  approved  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic 
melanoma that expresses a somatic gene mutation known as BRAF V600 mutation. Mekinist (trametinib) 
was granted a marketing authorisation on June 30th 2014, and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) on August 26th 2013.  
The pivotal registration study for dabrafenib was the phase III BRF113683 study in which the efficacy and 
safety of dabrafenib was compared with DTIC. In this study, a statistically significant improvement in PFS 
(HR  0.37;  95%  CI  0.24,  0.58;  p<0.0001)  was  seen  where  median  PFS  for  dabrafenib  was  6.9  months 
compared  to  2.7  months  with  DTIC.  The  median  OS  for  dabrafenib  was  20.0  months  in  comparison  to 
15.6 months for DTIC (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.52, 1.13). 
In the pivotal phase III study of trametinib MEK114267, the median PFS was 4.8 for patients treated with 
trametinib  and  1.5  months  for  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  (HR  0.45;  95%  CI  0.33,  0.63; 
p<0.0001). The median OS was 15.6 and 11.3 months for patients in the trametinib and chemotherapy 
arms respectively (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.57,1.06).  
The  clinical  benefit  of  monotherapy  with  BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitors  appears  to  be  limited  by  the 
development of resistance, with approximately 50% of the patients treated with BRAF inhibitors progress 
within  5  to  7  months  after  starting  treatment.  There  are  several  mechanisms  of  acquired  resistance  to 
BRAF and MEK inhibitors that have been proposed. However, the main pathway for resistance is thought 
to  be  the  reactivation  of  the  MAPK  pathway  through  alternative  activation  of  downstream  MEK.  Thus, 
trametinib  and  dabrafenib  combination  would  inhibit  two  kinases  in  this  pathway,  MEK  and  RAF,  and 
provide  concomitant  inhibition  of  the  pathway.  It  is  suggested  that  inhibiting  both  MEK  and  BRAF 
simultaneously could postpone or possibly prevent the development of resistance.  
Other  treatment  options  have  been  approved  for  melanoma  in  recent  times,  namely  treatments  that 
target  the  immune  system  instead  of  targeting  the  cancer  itself.  In  2011,  the  anti-CTLA4  antibody 
ipilimumab (Yervoy) was approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in  adults.  More  recently,  additional  immunotherapeutic  options  available  include  the  monoclonal 
antibodies  nivolumab  (Opdivo)  and  pembrolizumab  (Keytruda)  for  the  treatment  of  advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
The  applicant  has  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  both  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  MAs  to 
include  the  combination  of  trametinib  with  dabrafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.  
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
“Dabrafenib  in  combination  with  trametinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.” 
“Trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.” 
The final approved indications are as follows: 
Mekinist 
“Trametinib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF  V600  mutation  (see  sections  4.4  and 
5.1). 
Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior 
BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1).” 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015 
Page 5/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Tafinlar 
“Dabrafenib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  trametinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF  V600  mutation  (see  sections  4.4 
and 5.1).” 
The recommended dose of trametinib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, is 
2 mg once daily (QD). The recommended dose of dabrafenib, when used in combination with trametinib, 
is 150 mg twice daily (BID) (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The recommended dose of dabrafenib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib, is 
150 mg  (two 75 mg  capsules)  twice  daily  (corresponding  to  a  total  daily  dose  of  300 mg).  The 
recommended  dose  of  trametinib,  when  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib,  is  2 mg  once  daily  (QD) 
(see SmPC section 4.2). 
Patients should take trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib at least one hour prior 
to or two hours after a meal due to the effect of food on trametinib absorption (see section 4.2 and 5.2).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Trametinib  and  dabrafenib  as  single  agents  have  shown  growth  inhibition  of  BRAF  V600  mutant 
melanoma  cell  lines  and  demonstrate  anti-tumour  effects  in  BRAF  V600  mutant  melanoma  animal 
models. The non-clinical aspects of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib have been presented in 
the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application.  In  summary,  the  data  submitted  had  shown  that  the 
combination  resulted  in  vitro  cell  growth  inhibition  in  cells  that  harboured  human  BRAFV600  mutations 
and for those that had become resistant to dabrafenib treatment. In vivo in A375PF11 BRAFV600E human 
melanoma  mouse  xenografts,  the  combination  treatment  showed  a  delayed  tumour  resistance  and 
significant survival improvement with prolonged tumour growth inhibition and delayed tumour outgrowth 
when  compared  to  treatment  with  the  single  agents  individually.  Sequential  administration  of  one  week 
dabrafenib (30 mg/kg) and the other week trametinib (3 mg/kg) for 11 weeks showed prolonged tumour 
growth inhibition.  
A  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs  receiving  trametinib  (0.0075/5  or  0.0225/20  mg/kg/day  for 
trametinib/dabrafenib)  resulted  in  decreased  food  consumption,  abnormal  faeces,  decrease  in  body 
weight which resulted in mortality in one male rat. Microscopic findings were observed in the heart, colon, 
rectum,  mesenteric lymph  nodes  and  thymus.  There  was  evidence  of  toxicity  to  the  heart  and  coronary 
arteries and veins, with vascular changes characterized by endothelial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, 
disruption  of  the  internal  elastic  lamina  and  fibrinoid  necrosis  of  the  tunica  media,  and  perivascular 
inflammation leading to haemorrhage.

Proliferative  skin  lesions  such  as  epithelial  hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis  of  the  skin  and  forestomach 
mucosa induced with dabrafenib treatment alone administered for at least 2 weeks were not observed in 
the combination study.  
Toxicity  was  observed  in  the  male  and  female  reproductive  organs.  Testicular  toxicity  characterised  by 
testicular  degeneration  and  secondary  epididymal  oligospermia  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs  in  a  13 
week toxicity study. After 4 week recovery period, there was no sign of reversibility. In females, toxicity 
characterised  by  alteration  in  follicular  maturation  was  observed  in  a  repeat  toxicity  study.  The  effects 
were reversible following 4 weeks recovery period. Developmental toxicities were observed in rats given 
dabrafenib, and in rats and rabbits given trametinib. These effects occurred at exposures below those in 
patients receiving recommended doses and were considered to be related to pharmacology.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Two additional primary pharmacodynamics studies have been performed. These in vivo studies examined 
the effect of combination dosing in a mouse BRAF mutant human melanoma xenograft model. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Anti-tumour effect of dabrafenib and trametinib in melanoma xenografted mice (study 2012N152372) 
Female  CD-1  nude  mice  were  xenografted  with  the  A375P  F11  cell  line,  encoding  a  mutation  for 
BRAFV600E.  The  xenografted  mice  (n=15/group)  were  administered  trametinib  (0.3  or  1  mg/kg/day), 
dabrafenib (30 mg/kg/day) or a combination thereof orally by gavage for 14 or 28 days.

Anti-tumour  effect  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  with  dexamethasone  in  melanoma  xenografted  mice 
(study 2014n201242) 
Female  athymic  nude  mice  were  xenografted  with  the  A375P  F11  cell  line,  encoding  a  mutation  for 
BRAFV600E. Mice were treated with 1 mg/kg/day trametinib and 30 mg/kg/day dabrafenib with or without 
1 mg/kg/day dexamethasone for 28 days. Treatment was interrupted due to overt toxicity at day 6 and 
continued at day 15 through day 28. From day 15, mice were treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day trametinib, 30 
mg/kg/day dabrafenib and 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone on a five days on/two days off schedule. The anti-
tumour  efficacy  of  the  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  combination  was  not  affected  by  addition  of 
dexamethasone.  
Figure 2: 
Median  tumour  growth  in  A375P  F11s  in  athymic  mice  following  treatment 
trametinib, dabrafenib and dexamethasone 
Addition  of  dexamethasone  also  induced  a  body  weight  loss  of  more  than  20%.  Due  to  the  weight  loss 
observed  with  triple  combination  therapy,  a  dosing  holiday  was  given  for  all  groups  on  Day  6.  Body 
weights recovered, and dosing resumed on D15 with trametinib and dabrafenib.

2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  data  for  the  combination  treatment  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  was  previously 
presented  and  assessed  as  part  of  the  monotherapy  application  for  trametinib.  In  order  to  support  the 
combination  therapy,  the  MAH  submitted  two  new  pharmacology  studies  that  showed  that  the 
combination of trametinib and dabrafenib inhibited the growth of tumours in in vivo models. Exposure to 
the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in xenograft V600 mutant mice models showed an increase 
in  tumour  response  as  compared  to  the  monotherapy  of  either  dabrafenib  or  trametinib  alone.  The 
tumour  response  observed  was  not 
influenced  by 
the  use  of 
the  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressant  corticosteroid  dexamethasone.  Therefore,  the  combination  of  trametinib  with 
dabrafenib showed anti-tumour activity in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma cell lines in vitro and 
delays the emergence of resistance in vivo in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts. 
There were no new toxicity findings in the studies submitted compared to the non-clinical data presented 
in the trametinib and dabrafenib initial marketing authorisation applications. Toxicity studies in dogs have 
shown some increase in toxicity compared to monotherapy where trametinib and dabrafenib were given 
in  combination  for  4  weeks,  signs  of  gastro-intestinal  toxicity  and  decreased  lymphoid  cellularity  of  the 
thymus  were  observed  at  lower  exposures  than  in  dogs  given  trametinib  alone.  Otherwise,  similar 
toxicities were observed as in comparable monotherapy studies.  
Development  toxicity  was  observed  in  the  monotherapy  for  dabrafenib  and  trametinib.  The  findings 
suggest  a  risk  for  human  embryofoetal  development,  including  teratogenic  effects.  It  is  reasonable  to 
presume that the effect of the combination treatment on developmental toxicity would not differ from the 
monotherapy.    This  has  already  been  addressed  previously  in  the  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  initial 
applications,  where  development  toxicity  was  identified  as  an  important  potential  risk  or  as  missing 
information  and  will  be  monitored  as  an  important  potential  risk  through  routine  risk  minimisation 
measures. 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure  further  to  the  use  of  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib.  Considering  the  above  data, 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  studies  were  considered  adequate  and  acceptable  for  the  assessment  of  non-clinical 
aspects  of  an  application  for  the  extension  of  indication  for  the  combination  therapy  of  trametinib  with

PK  data  for  the  combination  were  obtained  from  the  Phase  I/II,  open-label,  dose-escalation  Study 
BRF113220,  and  the  pivotal  Phase  III,  randomized,  double-blinded  Study  MEK115306.  In  part  A,  the 
effect  of  repeat  doses  of trametinib 2  mg once  daily  on  single dose dabrafenib  was  investigated,  part  B 
was  a  dose  escalation  and  cohort  expansion  of  combination  dabrafenib  and  trametinib,  Part  C  was  a 
randomized  Phase  II  part  of  the  study  including  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  as  monotherapy  and  in 
combination  with  trametinib  1  and  2  mg  once  daily,  and  in  Part  D,  PK  and  safety  of  dabrafenib  75  and 
150  mg  BID  administered  as  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose  or  hypromellose  (HPMC)  capsules  as 
monotherapy and in combination with trametinib 2 mg once daily was assessed.  
Study BRF113220 Part A: interaction between trametinib and dabrafenib 
Trametinib had shown inhibitory potential against CYP2C8 in vitro, with a concentration resulting in 50% 
of maximum inhibition (IC50) of 0.34 µM. In vitro studies demonstrated that the oxidative metabolism of 
dabrafenib was mediated by CYP2C8 and could potentially be affected by CYP2C8 inhibitors.  
A  total  of  8  subjects  were  included  in  Part  A.  GLS  means  ratios  of  dabrafenib  plus  trametinib  to 
dabrafenib  alone  (90%  CI)  were  1.03  (0.79,  1.34),  1.01  (0.85,  1.19),  and  0.94  (0.82,  1.08)  for  Cmax, 
AUC(0-t)  and  AUCinf,  respectively.  The  90%  CI  for  AUCs  were  contained  within  the  80  to  125% 
boundaries.  Median  tmax  was  2.5  and  2.0  hours  with  administration  of  dabrafenib  alone  and  with 
trametinib,  respectively.  Similar  results  were  noted  with  dabrafenib  metabolites  including  hydroxy-
,carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib with GLS mean dabrafenib plus trametinib to dabrafenib alone ratios 
ranging from 0.92 to 1.03 for the different PK parameters. 
Study BRF113220 Part B: dose escalation and cohort expansion of combination dabrafenib and trametinib 
The initial dose of the combination was half the recommended dose of each agent. Doses of trametinib 1, 
1.5, and 2 mg once-daily were administered in combination with dabrafenib (75 or 150 mg BID, gelatin 
capsules) using a dose escalation procedure. The dose proportionality of trametinib was evaluated using a 
power model. 
Dose  escalation  proceeded  until  the  recommended  single  agent  doses  of  dabrafenib  (150  mg  BID)  and 
trametinib (2 mg once daily). One subject experienced a dose limiting toxicity of neutrophilic panniculitis 
in Part B, at a dose of dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 2 mg once daily. A total of 79 subjects were 
treated. 
Dabrafenib:  The  geometric  mean  AUCinf  following  administration  of  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  (gelatin 
capsule) in combination with trametinib 1, 1.5, or 2 mg trametinib ranged from 3539 to 5187 ng*hr/mL 
on Day 15 (n=13) and from 4528 to 5518 ng*hr/mL on Day 21 (n=28). 
Trametinib: At doses of 1, 1.5, and 2 mg once-daily, geometric mean trametinib AUC(0-8), AUCinf, Cmax 
and  Cτ  on  Days  15  (n  =  20)  and  21  (n  =  35)  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner.  Following 
administration  of  trametinib  2  mg  once-daily  doses,  geometric  mean  (%  between  subject  coefficient  of 
variability [CVb]) Cmax, AUCinf and Cτ were 22.4 ng/mL (30%), 394 ng*hr/mL (35%), and 12.4 ng/mL 
(42%),  respectively,  on  Day  15  and  22.6  ng/mL  (36%),  351  ng*hr/mL  (34%),  and  10.8  ng/mL  (34%), 
respectively, on Day 21.

Trametinib and dabrafenib PK parameters obtained in combination were generally consistent throughout 
studies BRF113220, BRF113683 and BRF 113771. 
The  final  validated  models  developed  for  the  combination  were  used  to  evaluate  data  obtained  in  the

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pop-PK: exposure-response 
Response Rate (Study BRF113220, Part C) 
The  relationship  between  response  rate  and  exposure  was  explored  graphically  by  binning  data  into 
quartiles of exposure (Study 2012N144949_02). Figure 3 shows an increase in response rate with higher 
trametinib  average  exposure  (≥10  ng/mL).  These  data  support  selection  of  combination  dose  with 
trametinib 2 mg once daily. 
Figure 3: 
Proportion  of  responders  as  a  function  of  trametinib  exposure  from  subjects 
enrolled - Study BRF113220 Part C 
There  was  no  relationship  between  response  rate  and  dabrafenib  or  dabrafenib  metabolites  exposure 
across dabrafenib monotherapy and combination cohorts.

Progression-Free Survival (Study MEK115306) 
The relationship between PFS and quartiles of exposure was explored based on results from the Phase III 
study MEK115306 (Study 2013N184875_00). Results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 for dabrafenib 
and trametinib, respectively.

Adverse Events 
The relationship between pyrexia and exposure was explored by plotting the safety data against quartiles 
of exposure in Study  MEK115306 (Study 2013N184875_00) or tertiles of exposure in Study  BRF113220 
Part C (Study 2012N144949_02). The analysis was performed on pyrexia events.

Higher  rates  of  pyrexia  were  noted  when  dabrafenib  was  administered  with  trametinib  (Figure  6).  The 
incidence  of  pyrexia  tended  to  be  higher  with  higher  trametinib  exposure  when  administered  in 
combination.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  characteristics  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  when  administered  as 
monotherapy,  as  well  as  the  clinical  pharmacology  characteristics  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib 
administered  in  combination  have  been  well  characterized  and  have  been  described  previously  in  the 
monotherapy applications (EMEA/H/C/2604 and EMEA/H/C/2643).  
When  given  in  combination,  the  recommended  dose  of  the  combination  is  150  mg  twice-daily  (BID)  of 
dabrafenib  with  2  mg  once-daily  of  trametinib,  administered  under  fasting  conditions.  These  doses  in 
combination are equal to the doses applied for the individual drugs dabrafenib and trametinib when given 
as monotherapy.  
Based on the data obtained from Study BFR113220, co-administration of repeat dosing of trametinib and 
dabrafenib  resulted  in  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  trametinib  or  dabrafenib  Cmax  and  AUC  with 
increases of 16 and 23 %, respectively.  A small decrease in trametinib bioavailability, corresponding to a 
decrease in AUC of 12 %, was estimated when trametinib is administered in combination with dabrafenib, 
a CYP3A4 inducer, using a population PK analysis. Therefore, administration of dabrafenib and trametinib 
in combination had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of trametinib or of dabrafenib relative to 
administration of either compound alone.  
With dabrafenib and trametinib given in combination at a 150 mg BID and 2 mg OD dose, there was no 
apparent relationship between PFS and dabrafenib or trametinib exposure but there was a noted increase 
in responses with higher exposure to trametinib.  
When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib, concurrent administration of strong inhibitors or 
strong  inducers  of  CYP3A4  or  CYP2C8  should  be  avoided  (see  section  4.4  and  4.5  of  dabrafenib  and 
trametinib SmPC). 
An increase in the proportion of subjects experiencing pyrexia was noted with administration of trametinib 
in combination with dabrafenib, compared to administration of dabrafenib as monotherapy.  Incidence of 
pyrexia tended to be higher with higher trametinib exposure when administered in combination. Although 
rate of pyrexia was not related to dabrafenib concentrations, a trend toward higher rates of pyrexia was 
noted with higher hydroxy-dabrafenib concentrations upon combining dabrafenib 150 mg and trametinib

2 mg. Pyrexia is a known important identified risk with dabrafenib which is already addressed in the RMP 
and monitored through routine minimisation measures. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  data  provided  is  considered  sufficient  to  characterise  the  PK  and  PD  of  an  application  for  the 
extension of indication for the combination therapy of trametinib with dabrafenib.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  efficacy  for  the  combination  of  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  treatment  in  unresectable  and 
metastatic  melanoma  patients  in  melanoma  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  BRAFV600  mutation  was 
supported  by  the  submission  of  an  update  to  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  and  by  the  two  phase  III 
studies, MEK115306 which evaluated the treatment of dabrafenib in combination trametinib vs dabrafenib 
in  untreated  melanoma  patients  and  study  MEK116513,  which  evaluated  the  treatment  of  dabrafenib  in 
combination  trametinib  vs  vemurafenib  in  untreated  melanoma  patients  with  BRAFV600  tumours. 
Headline  results  for  study  MEK115306  have  been  evaluated  in  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  for 
trametinib. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
2.4.2.  Dose response study BRF113220 on the combination of dabrafenib and 
trametinib 
Study  BRF113220  was  performed  to  determine  the  optimal  dosage  of  trametinib  when  applied  in 
combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive stage IIIc or 
IV melanoma.  
In  Part  B  of  study  BRF113220  patients  were  enrolled  in  escalating  dose  cohorts  of  dabrafenib  and 
trametinib. The endpoints for ORR, PFS and DoR are presented in Table 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

survival (OS) (key secondary), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response 
To characterize the safety of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy, including incidences of 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and other proliferative cutaneous lesions; and 
To characterize the concentrations of trametinib and of dabrafenib and its metabolites in subjects in 
the combination arm and of dabrafenib and its metabolites in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  Progression-Free  Survival (PFS)  defined  as the  time  from  randomisation  until 
the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. 
Secondary endpoints were as follows: 
•  Overall survival (OS) as defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. 
•  Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response 
[CR]  or  partial  response  [PR]  at  any  time  per  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours 
[RECIST], version 1.1. 
•  Duration  of  response  was  defined  as  the  time  from  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until 
disease progression or death due to any cause among subjects who achieve an overall response. 
•  Safety  as  measured  by  clinical  assessments  including  vital  signs  and  physical examinations,  12-lead 
electrocardiograms  (ECG),  echocardiogram  (ECHO),  chemistry  and  haematology  laboratory  values, 
incidence of squamous cell carcinoma, and adverse events (AEs). 
•  Concentrations of trametinib and of dabrafenib and its metabolites (GSK2285403, GSK2298683, and 
GSK2167542)  in  the  combination  arm  and  dabrafenib  and  its  metabolites  in  the  dabrafenib 
monotherapy arm. 
Exploratory endpoints were as follows: 
•  Changes  from  baseline  in  HRQOL  measures  assessed  using  the  European  Organisation  for  Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol-5D 
(EQ-5D). 
•  Apparent  clearance  following  oral  dosing  (CL/F),  volume  of  distribution  (V/F),  and  the  effect  of 
combination  therapy  on  CL/F,  exposure-response  with  tumour  size,  and  other  clinical/safety

Sample size 
The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% increase in PFS (i.e., HR: 0.5889, median 
PFS  of  5.3  and  9  months  in  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  and  the  combination  therapy  arm, 
respectively). Assuming one-sided overall alpha of 0.025, power of 90%, and a randomization ratio of 1:1 
a total of 155 events (progression or deaths) were estimated to be required. According to the statistical 
plan  (SAP),  with  155  events  it  would  have  been  possible  to  detect  an  improvement  as  low  as  37.7% 
(HR=0.726  which  equates  to  median  PFS  of  7.3  and  5.3  months,  respectively)  with  statistical 
significance.  At  the  time  of  the  final  PFS  analysis  an  interim  OS  was  planned.  According  to  the  SAP, 
patients were to be followed for survival until 70% of the total enrolled population died or lost to follow-
up. Given a projected recruitment of 18 subjects per month over the first 6 months, and 75 subjects per 
month thereafter resulting in enrolment duration of approximately 9 months, 340 patients were originally 
planned.   
According to the Applicant due to 24% over-enrolment (423 patients instead of the planned 340), it was 
decided to perform the final PFS analysis after 193 events (instead of the originally planned 155) which 
represents  the  same  percentage  (45.6%)  of  total  enrolment  as  originally  planned.  This  change  was 
expected to increase the overall power from 90% to 95%. 
Randomisation 
A total of 423 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either dabrafenib 150 mg BID plus trametinib 2 
mg  QD  or  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  plus  placebo  dabrafenib.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E 
vs V600K).  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as a double-blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
Time to event-endpoints were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods, the stratified log-rank test and the 
Pike  estimator  for  the  hazard  ratio  and  its  confidence  interval  were  used.  A  stepwise  Cox  regression 
explored  for  PFS  the  influence  of  1.  Prior  immunotherapy  (Yes  vs.  No),  2.  Baseline  ECOG  performance 
status (0 vs. 1), 3. Stage at Screening (III, IVM1a, IVM1b vs. IVM1c), 4. Visceral Disease at Baseline (yes 
vs.  no),  5.  Number  of  disease  sites  at  baseline  (<3  vs.  ≥3),  6.  Gender  (Male  vs.  Female),  and  7.  Age 
(continuous). 
Primary endpoint: PFS 
•  Censoring rules were as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015 
Page 24/118 
 
  
  
•  Sensitivity analyses included: symptomatic progression as events, considering start of new anti-
cancer therapy as an event, considering radiological progression after extended loss to follow-up 
or start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event, and stratified Cox regression analysis. 
•  Over-enrolment was expected to induce more censorings and therefore bias in the estimation of 
the  median  in  the  combination  arm  if  the  original  timing  (155  events  out  of  340  patients,  so  at 
45.6% of total sample size) was kept.  Therefore the timing was changed proportionally to 45.6% 
of 423, so 193 events. 
Key secondary endpoints: OS.  
•  An  interim  analysis  using  a  Lan  alpha-spending  function,  with  O’Brien  like  boundaries  was 
performed. 
ORR was per investigator and were tabulated based on the number and percentage of subjects attaining 
an  overall  confirmed  CR  or  PR  in  subjects  with  measurable  disease  at  baseline.  Subjects  with  non-
evaluable best response were imputed as non-responders.   
QLQ-C30 and EQ5D were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measurements. 
Multiplicity: OS was tested hierarchically after PFS.

Recruitment 
A total of 423 patients were enrolled at 103 centres in 14 countries, including Germany (25 centres), the 
US (12 centres), and the UK (10 centres) as well as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Spain, France, Greece, 
Italy,  Netherlands,  Russian  Federation,  Sweden  and  Ukraine).    Patients  were  included  from  February 
2012 and the data cut-off for this study was 12 January 2015.  
Conduct of the study 
An  external  independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  monitored  the  conduct  of  the  study, 
periodically  assessed  safety  information,  and  also  reviewed  efficacy  data  of  the  interim  analyses.  The 
original MEK115306 Protocol, date 08 February 2012, was amended 8 times. The latest amendment was 
at 12 August 2014. The purpose of this amendment was to increase the time to study closure to obtain 
longer-term survival data; provide drug-specific instruction in cases where a  dose is missed; update list 
of concomitant medications; modify and/or clary dose modification guidelines for LVEF, hypertension, QTc 
prolongation,  hand-food  skin  reactions,  cuSCC,  pyrexia,  renal  insufficiency,  visual  changes,  and 
pneumonitis;  add  guidelines  for  new  primary  melanoma,  non-cutaneous  malignancies,  pancreatitis, 
hyperglycaemia,  and  retinal  pigment  epithelia  detachment;  remove  blood  sample  collection  for  cytokine 
analysis during a pyrexic event; clarify treatment of study treatment overdose regarding haemodialysis; 
add a descriptive analysis of PFS, DoR and ORR at the final analysis; add final OS analysis, based on US 
FDA feedback, to be performed at 220 events rather than 275 and descriptive OS update at 275 events; 
add  text  to  allow  eligible  patients  to  crossover  to  combination  therapy  if  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically meaningful OS benefit is observed at the final OS analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  (12  January  2015),  44%  of  subjects  in  the  dabrafenib  and  trametinib 
(combination therapy) arm and 36% of subjects in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm were still ongoing in 
the study. 
Primary endpoint: Progression-Free Survival 
The following analysis for PFS was conducted with a data lock point of 26 August 2013. 
Table 13: 
PFS by Investigator and BIRC Assessment - Study MEK115306 
An  updated  analysis  for  PFS  by  investigator  assessment  was  based  on  events  in  66%  and  76%  of  the 
patients, respectively in the combination therapy and monotherapy arms. Median PFS for the combination 
therapy  arm  was  11.0 months  compared  with  8.8 months  for  the dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  with  HR 
0.67 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.84; p<0.001).

Ancillary analyses 
Analysis  including  Symptomatic  Progressions:  PFS  is  analyzed  the  same  as  the  primary  endpoint 
with the addition that symptomatic progressions are also considered as events. 
Considering start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event: PFS is analyzed the same as the primary 
endpoint  with  the  addition  that  the  start  of  new  anticancer  therapy  is  considered  as  an  event,  even  if 
radiological progression was not documented. 
Analysis ignoring extended loss to follow up and start of new anti-cancer therapy:  Progression 
(based  only  on  radiologic  evidence)  or  death  is  considered  an  event  regardless  of  whether  it  occurred 
after  extended  lost  to  follow-up  or  initiation  of  a  new  anti-cancer  therapy.  If  a  subject  has  neither 
progressed nor died, then PFS is censored at the date of the last ‘adequate’ assessment.

o  Brain lesion(s), if still present, must be confirmed stable (i.e. no increase in lesion size), 
for  ≥12  weeks  prior  to  randomization  (stability  must  be  confirmed  with  two  consecutive 
MRI or CT scan with contrast, separated by > 6 weeks).  
o  Asymptomatic with no corticosteroids requirement for ≥4 weeks  prior to randomization, 
and 
o  No enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for ≥30 days prior to randomization 
•  History or evidence of cardiovascular risk   
•

syndrome or taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval 
•  History  or  current  evidence/risk  of  retinal  vein  occlusion  (RVO)  or  central  serous  retinopathy 
(CSR) 
Treatments 
Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  plus  trametinib 2  mg  daily  or  vemurafenib 
960 mg BID.  
Patients  received  study  treatment  until  disease  progression,  death  or  unacceptable  AE,  including 
hematologic or other non-hematologic toxicity, and/or meeting stopping criteria for liver chemistry.  
Furthermore,  patients  received  full  supportive  care  during  the  study,  including  transfusion  of  blood  and 
blood  products  and  treatment  with  antibiotics,  anti-emetics,  anti  diarrhoeals  and  analgesics,  as 
appropriate. Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin was permitted provided that international normalized 
ratio (INR was monitored in accordance with local institutional practice.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of study MEK116513 was to establish the superiority of dabrafenib and trametinib 
combination  therapy  over  vemurafenib  monotherapy  with  respect  to  overall  survival  (OS)  for  patients 
with advanced/metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  with 
vemurafenib monotherapy for the following: 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
•  Overall response rate (ORR) 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015 
Page 37/118 
 
  
  
•  Duration of response 
Furthermore  a  secondary  objective  was  to  characterize  the  safety  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib 
combination  therapy,  including  incidences  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC)  and  other  proliferative 
cutaneous lesions.  
An exploratory objective was to evaluate and compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 
patients  in  the  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  arm  with  those  in  the  vemurafenib 
monotherapy arm.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of MEK116513 was Overall Survival, defined as the time from randomization until 
death due to any cause.  
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  PFS  as  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  until  the  earliest 
date  of  disease  progression  by  investigator  per  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  In  Solid  Tumors  v1.1  or 
death  due  to  any  cause;  ORR  as  defined  as  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  a  confirmed  complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time per RECIST v1.1; Duration of response as defined as 
the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause 
among  subjects  who  achieved  an  overall  response  (i.e.,  confirmed  CR  or  PR);    ORR  defined  as    the 
percentage of patients with a confirmed CR or PR at any time  and Duration of response defined as the 
time  from  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until  disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause 
among patients who achieved an overall response (i.e., confirmed CR or PR).  
Disease progression and response evaluation were determined according to the definitions established in 
RECIST, version 1.1.  At baseline, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis or MRI 
of  the  abdomen/pelvis  and  any  area  of  known  disease,  skin  lesion  photography,  and  clinical  disease 
assessment for palpable lesions were performed.  If clinically indicated a CT or MRI scan of affected bone 
areas was required at baseline. Lesions, if present, continued to be followed consistently throughout the 
study until disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent. 
At each post-baseline assessment (Week 8 and every 8 week thereafter through Week 56 and then every 
12  weeks  thereafter),  evaluation  of  the  sites  of  disease  identified  by  these  scans  and/or  by  medical 
photography or direct measurement was required.  If the last radiographic assessment was more than 8 
weeks  prior  to  study  withdrawal  and  progressive  disease  (PD)  had  not  been  documented,  a  disease 
assessment was obtained at the time of withdrawal. 
All  patients  who  permanently  discontinued  dabrafenib  +  trametinib  or  vemurafenib  without  disease 
progression  continued  to  radiographic  disease  assessment  according  to  the  study  protocol  until  disease 
progression,  death  or  withdrawal  of  consent,  whichever  was  documented  first.  In  addition,  all  patients 
who  permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  were  followed  for  survival  and  new  anti-cancer  therapy. 
Follow-up continued until study completion/withdrawal or death, whichever occurred first.  
Other  secondary  endpoints  included,  safety  measurement  by  assessment  of  AEs,  clinical  assessment 
including  vital  signs  and  physical  examination,  ocular  examination,  12-lead  electrocardiograms  (ECG), 
echocardiogram (ECHO), chemistry and hematology laboratory values.  
Health-related  quality  of  life  measures  were  assessed  by  the  European  Organization  for  Research  and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, the EuroQol-5D and the melanoma subscale of 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Melanoma.

Under the assumptions that PFS was exponentially distributed, 1:1 randomization, 0.05 type I error, the 
study needed 288 deaths in the final analysis to detect a HR= 0.675 with 90% power (median OS times 
of 13.5 and 20 months in the vemurafenib arm and the combination therapy arm, respectively). Given an 
accrual  rate  of  18  subjects  per  month  over  the  first  6  months,  and  75  subjects  per  month  thereafter 
resulting in enrollment duration of approximately 13 months, an estimated total of 694 subjects (i.e., 347 
subjects in each of the arms) would need to be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Before randomization eligible patients were stratified by LDH (above ULN vs. equal to or below ULN) and 
BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K).  Patients with both V600E and V600K mutations were included in 
the V600K count for the stratification.  
Patients were centrally randomized (randomized phase) through the Registration and Medication Ordering 
System (RAMOS) (Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dabrafenib 
and trametinib combination therapy or vemurafenib monotherapy.  
Blinding (masking) 
This study was designed as an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
Overall  survival  was  summarized  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  and  survival  curves  were  compared 
between  treatment  arms  using  a  stratified  log-rank  test  stratifying  for  BRAF  mutation  status  (V600E 
versus V600K) and baseline LDH (>ULN versus ≤ULN).  
The statistical methods were the same as in study 115306 with the following alterations: 
•  OS (instead of PFS) was primary; no multiplicity for secondary endpoints (such as PFS, ORR) 
• 
interim  analysis  OS  at  70%  of  required  events  (i.e.,  202  of  the  288  events  for  the  final  OS 
analysis)  with    Lan  and  DeMets  version  of  the  O’Brien-Fleming  alpha-spending  function  for 
efficacy and a Rho beta-spending function (Rho = 3) for futility:

Conduct of the study 
The  original  study  protocol  dated  15  March  2012  was  amended  4  times.    The  main  changes  to  the 
protocol were as follows:  
•  Amendment 01: included new requirements for subjects that remained on study treatment after 
radiographic disease progression, required treatment interruption for any treatment-related AE of 
grade 3, required that rash of grade ≥3 must resolve to grade ≤1 before study treatment could 
resume,  enhanced  monitoring  for  ophthalmic  toxicities  and  some  additional  changes  to  the 
eligibility criteria and clarification to the protocol in relation to safety 
•  Amendment 03: changes to the protocol included revision of table for dose modifications for LVEF 
decrease, monitoring guidelines for new cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies and revisions 
to clarify the guidance on the management of patients and ADRs during the study. 
•  Amendment 04: revision to the management and dose modification guidelines for particular ADRs 
and added new guideline for pancreatitis and hyperglycaemia. 
The  study  was  stopped  early  as  the  adjusted  stopping  boundary  for  efficacy  at  the  interim  analysis 
(p<0.0214) was crossed and the study was stopped for efficacy by the IDMC.

Numbers analysed 
All  704  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  ITT  population.  The  majority  of  patients  (89%)  had 
BRAF  V600E  mutation-positive  melanoma.  BRAF  V600E  and  BRAF  V600K  mutation-positive  populations 
are  subsets  of  the  ITT  population.  These  subsets  do  not  include  the  6  patients  with  both  V600E  and 
V600K, or the 1 patient with wild type BRAF.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Overall survival 
The  results  for  OS  are  presented  in  Table  20.  Median  OS  has  not  been  reached  in  the  combination 
therapy  arm  and  was  17.2  months  in  the  vemurafenib  monotherapy  arm  with  a  HR  of  0.69  (95%  CI: 
0.53, 0.89; p=0.005).  
The  median  follow-up  time  (defined  as  time  from  randomization  to  death  or  last  contact)  was  11.0 
months in the combination therapy arm and 10.0 months in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm.

Sensitivity analysis 
The following sensitivity analyses were conducted for PFS by investigator assessment:  
•  Symptomatic progression as events 
•  Considering start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event 
•  Considering radiological progression after extended loss to follow-up and start of new anti-cancer 
therapy as an event 
•  Cox regression proportional hazards regression model 
•  Using derived responses from investigator lesion assessments.  
Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result observed for the overall ITT analysis.

Supportive study(ies) 
The  study  BRF113220  is was  an  open-label 4  part study  designed to  assess the  safety,  clinical efficacy, 
and pharmacokinetic activity of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib. Part B of this study 
evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  escalating  doses  of  dabrafenib  (75  and  150  mg  twice  daily)  and 
trametinib  (1,  1.5,  and  2  mg  once  daily)  and  26  patients  had  a  prior  BRAFi  therapy.  Part  C  was  a 
randomized,  three-arm  portion of  the  study  where patients  were  assigned  at  a  ratio  of 1:1:1 to  receive 
dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily as monotherapy or in combination with either trametinib 1mg once daily or 
2mg once daily; 45 patients were randomized to dabrafenib monotherapy and subsequently crossed over 
to the combination therapy. 
BRF113220 Part C was considered a supportive study for the proposed indication for the combination of 
trametinib  and  dabrafenib.  Data  on  response  rate  and  PFS  have  been  previously  presented  in  the 
pharmacology section as well as the dose response section. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib 
has  demonstrated  limited  efficacy  in  patients  who  have  progressed  after  a  prior  BRAFi  monotherapy  in 
study BRF113220. 
The efficacy of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib for patients previously treated with a 
BRAFi alone before enrolment (BRAFi–resistant portion of part B) and for those who received dabrafenib 
monotherapy in this study who then crossed over to combination therapy at disease progression (cross-
over portion of part C) were assessed.

The efficacy of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib for patients previously treated with a 
BRAF  inhibitor  alone  before  enrolment  (BRAFi–resistant  portion  of  part  B)  and  for  those  who  received 
dabrafenib  monotherapy  in  this  study  who  then  crossed  over  to  combination  therapy  at  disease 
progression (cross-over portion of part C) were assessed. 
Patients from Part B had a confirmed response rate of 15% (4/26) and in Part C the patients who crossed 
over after progression on dabrafenib monotherapy had a confirmed response rate of 13% (6/45). Median 
progression free survival was 3.6 months for both parts (Part B 95% CI 2-5 m and Part C 95% CI 2-4m). 
There  were  22  patients  receiving  dabrafenib  monotherapy  for  <6  months  and  23  patients  receiving 
dabrafenib from ≥6 months. 
Patients  that  had  been  treated  with  dabrafenib  monotherapy  for  ≥  6  months  prior  to  developing 
progressive  disease,  had  a  better  clinical  outcome  with  the  combination  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib 
where response rate of 26% with a median PFS of 3.9 months (95% CI, 3-7m) for patients treated longer 
than  6  months  compared  to  response  rate  of  0%  and  median  PFS  of  1.8  months  (95%  CI,  2-4m)  for 
patients who rapidly progressed in less than 6 months on their prior dabrafenib monotherapy.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  MEK115306  study  was  a  randomized  controlled  phase  III  study.  Progression  free  survival  was  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  whereas  OS  was  a  secondary  endpoint.  The  design  and  conduct  of  the  study 
were considered acceptable. The CHMP noted that there was an over-enrolment of almost a quarter of the 
Assessment report

planned  study  size.  To  assess  whether  the  key  results  were  possibly  impacted  because  of  the  over 
enrolment,  the  MAH  provided  an  analysis  on  the  original  sample  size  (i.e.,  a  PFS-analysis  timed  at  the 
155 PFS event of the first 340 recruited patients) and the data confirmed the statistically significant PFS 
benefit  of  combination  therapy  when  compared  with  monotherapy  BRAF  inhibitor  in  the  original  dataset 
as planned in the SAP. 
The  MEK116513  study  was  an  open-label  randomized  Phase  III  study  comparing  dabrafenib  and 
trametinib  combination therapy  with  vemurafenib  monotherapy.  The  primary endpoint  of this  study  was 
OS  and  no  cross  over  was  allowed  following  discontinuation.    Only  12  patients  of  the  vemurafenib 
monotherapy arm and 5 of the patients in the combination arm discontinued treatment upon decision of 
the  patient,  suggesting  that  the  open  label  design  did  not  introduce  a  bias  to  the  study  results.    Other 
systemic  therapies  were  only  allowed  after  study  treatment  discontinuation.    The  design  and  conduct  of 
the study were considered acceptable.  
The  patient  population  included  in  the  MEK115306  study  and  the  MEK116513  study  were  comparable. 
The demographic characteristics and baseline characteristics for the treatment arm in study MEK115306 
and in study MEK116513 were reasonably balanced, with the exception of a higher occurrence of visceral 
disease  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  compared  with  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  in  the  study 
MEK115306 and more patients with >3 sites in the combination arm compared with the vemurafenib arm 
in the study MEK116513. However, these imbalances did not affect the reliability of the study results. The 
stratification  factors  of  LDH≤ ULN  versus  LDH>ULN  and  V600E  versus  V600K,  the  treatment  arms  were 
considered balanced. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
MEK115306 
In the updated PFS analysis submitted with the application, 71.2% of the events for the PFS analysis (by 
investigator)  had  occurred.  The  HR=  0.67  (95%  CI  0.53,  0.84;  p<0.001)  was  in  favour  of  the 
combination therapy with a median PFS of 11.0 months compared with 8.8 months for the monotherapy 
dabrafenib.  
In  the  final  OS  analysis,  47%  of  the  patients  in  the  combination  arm  had  died  whereas  58%  of  the 
patients  in  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  had  died.  For  the  whole  study  population,  52.4%  of  the  death 
events  had  occurred  and  thus  the  OS  data  could  be  considered  reasonably  mature.    The  Kaplan-Meier 
curves for overall survival separated between the 2 and 3 months and remained separate until 24 months 
of  follow  up.    The  median  OS  for  the  combination  therapy  was  25.1  months  and  for  monotherapy 
dabrafenib was 18.7 months with a HR of 0.71, (95% CI: 0.55, 0.92, p=0.011). The difference in OS of 
6.4 months for the combination therapy was statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant.  
The reported overall response rate (ORR; CR and PR) for the combination arm was higher than the ORR 
for the monotherapy arm (69% vs 53%, respectively), suggesting a higher anti-tumour activity with the 
combination treatment. 
MEK116513 
At the time of data lock point, the median time of follow up was above 10 months. The Kaplan-Meier OS 
curves separated early in the 3 to 4 month range and remained separate throughout the time of median 
follow-up.  The  median  OS  was  18.0  months  for  vemurafenib  and  was  25.6  months  for  the  combination 
treatment  with  an  estimate  HR=0.66  (95%  CI:  0.53,  0.81;  p<0.001)  which  was  statistically  significant. 
The updated OS analysis for Study MEK116513 was based on 349 (50%) of events, which is very similar 
to the final OS analysis for Study MEK115306, which was based on 222 events (52%). The median PFS 
for the combination therapy was 11.4 months compared to 7.3 months for monotherapy with a HR=0.56 
(95% CI: 0.46, 0.69; p<0.001) that was statistically significant.  
Assessment report

The OS data for the combination therapy dabrafenib and trametinib obtained in studies MEK115306 and 
MEK116513 were comparable to each other. The OS results of the phase II study BRF113220 part C were 
supportive  and  showed  a  slightly  shorter  survival  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib  and  trametinib 
combination therapy.  
The PFS results were consistent with the positive OS results for the combination therapy, which are less 
susceptible for performance and assessment bias than PFS results.  
The ORR was higher for the combination arm than for the monotherapy arms for both studies MEK116513 
study  and  study  BRF113220  Part  C  (MEK116513;  64%  vs  51%  and  BRF113220  76%  vs  54%, 
respectively) suggesting a higher anti-tumour activity with the combination treatment. 
The QoL assessment shows for both phase III studies, at least until disease progression, a better health 
related  quality  of  life  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib+trametinib  than  for  patients  treated  with  a 
BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. 
Subgroup analyses 
No PFS or OS subgroup analysis was conducted for patients with a history of brain metastasis. Due to the 
strict  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  of  the  studies,  fewer  than  20  patients  with  a  history  of  brain 
metastases were treated in the clinical trials.  Therefore the efficacy of combination therapy for patients 
with a history of brain metastasis in not known and a statement in the SmPC in section 4.4 and 5.1 has 
been  included  to  inform  the  prescriber  of  the  lack  of  data  in  this  patient  population.    In  addition,  the 
effect of the combination therapy in melanoma patients with brain metastasis will be evaluated in study 
BRF117277,  a  phase  II  open  label  study  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  in  subjects  with  BRAF  mutation 
positive melanoma that has metastasised to the brain. 
The  CHMP  noted that  in  the  two  phase  III  studies only  patients  with  BRAF  V600  mutation tumours  who 
were  treatment  naïve  were  included.  The  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  as  second  line  therapy  for 
patients  who  had  been  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors  was  not  investigated.  In  the  phase  II  study 
BRF113220, responses with the combination treatment were seen only in a limited percentage of patients 
(around  10%)  who  were  previously  treated  with  dabrafenib  monotherapy.  Response  to  the  combination 
therapy  was  observed  in  patients  who  had  achieved  relative  long-lasting  (>6  months)  response  during 
treatment  with  dabrafenib  monotherapy.  Because  of  the  lack  of  robust  data  in  patients  that  have 
progressed  on  BRAF  inhibitor  therapy,  a  warning  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC 
highlighting that there is limited data in this patient population and recommending prescribers to consider 
other treatment options before treatment with the combination in patients that have had prior treatment 
with BRAF inhibitors.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the two phase III studies for dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy were generally 
consistent with each other and the results of the Phase II study BRF113220 part C were supportive. The 
benefits  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced  melanoma  with 
BRAFV600 mutation were considered statistically significant and clinically relevant in terms of prolonged 
OS,  PFS  and  increased  response  rates.    The  updated  results  from  study  MEK115306  and  MEK116513 
provided reassurance of the durability of the OS in the treated patient population. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015

Safety  data  include  comparisons  of  combination  dabrafenib+trametinib  treatment  to  dabrafenib 
monotherapy in the Phase III Study MEK115306, and comparisons of combination dabrafenib+trametinib 
treatment to vemurafenib monotherapy in the Phase III Study MEK116513.   
Data cut-off dates for the studies were as follows: 
•  MEK115306 (COMBI-d): 12 January 2015 (final overall survival [OS] analysis) 
•  MEK116513 (COMBI-v): 17 April 2014 (primary analysis) 
The  safety  results  of  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  Part  C  are  considered  as  supportive  to  the  results 
obtained in the phase III studies and have been described in the initial marketing application for Mekinist.

(Safety Population) 
The median times on study treatment were similar for the combination arms in both studies, and longer 
than for the respective monotherapy arms. At the time of the data-cut-off almost half of the patients in 
MEK115306  and  25%  of  patients  in  the  MEK116513  study  had  received  more  than  12  months  of 
combination therapy.  
Adverse events  
Almost  all  patients  in  all  treatment  arms  in  both  studies  experienced  an  AE,  and  more  than  85%  of 
patients had an AE considered related to study treatment. 
AEs  leading  to  a  dose  modification  (dose  discontinuations,  reductions  or  interruptions)  were  more 
common in the combination therapy arm compared with the dabrafenib monotherapy arm in MEK115306.

Table 28: 
Overview of adverse events in BRF113220 Part C, final CSR (cut-off 15 Jan 2014) 
AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  occurred  in  11-13%  of  patients  in  the 
combination treatment, which was comparable to what was seen in the comparator arms of vemurafenib 
treatment (12%) but higher than for the dabrafenib arm, 7%. 
AEs leading to dose reduction were reported for 28-33% of patients on the combination treatment, which 
was lower than for the comparator vemurafenib arm (39%) but higher than for the dabrafenib arm, 14%. 
Any  SAE  was  reported  for  37-42%  of  patients  on  the  combination  arms,  which  was  roughly  similar  to 
what was noted for both comparator arms (vemurafenib arm, 35% and dabrafenib arm, 37%). 
Fatal  SAEs  were  uncommon  for  all  treatment  arms  (<1%-2%  in  the  combination  arms  and  <1%  in 
patients on the comparator arms).

The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  for  the  combination  treatment  were  pyrexia,  fatigue,  nausea, 
diarrhoea, and chills, where  the most commonly reported AEs in the comparator arm of dabrafenib were 
fatigue, hyperkeratosis, pyrexia, arthralgia, and headache and for vemurafenib arm, AEs were arthralgia, 
rash, alopecia, diarrhoea, nausea, and fatigue. 
AEs  that  were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  combination  arms  in  general  vs  the  dabrafenib  arm 
included  pyrexia,  nausea,  chills,  diarrhoea,  vomiting,  hypertension,  oedema  peripheral,  dizziness,  ALT 
increased,  AST  increased,  urinary  tract  infection,  neutropenia  and  muscle  spasms  and  blood  creatinine 
increased.  In  contrast,  AEs  that  were  less  commonly  reported  were  alopecia,  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia and terms related to hyperproliferative states of the skin. 
AEs  that  were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  combination  arms  in  general  vs  the  vemurafenib  arm 
included pyrexia, chills, vomiting, cough, neutropenia and muscle spasms. In contrast, the AEs that were 
less  commonly 
reported  were 
rash,  decreased  appetite,  pruritus,  alopecia,  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia, terms related to hyperproliferative states of the skin, dysgeusia, weight decreased, 
blood creatinine increased, photosensitivity reaction, conjunctivitis and sunburn. 
Approximately half of the patients in the combination therapy arms in both studies had pyrexia that was 
considered  related  to  study  treatment  which  was  2  to  3  times  higher  incidence  than  either  of  the 
monotherapy  arms.  The  next  most  common  AEs  (≥20%)  considered  related  to  study  treatment  in  the 
combination arms of both studies were chills, fatigue, and nausea (Table 30).

The  most  common  AEs  reported  in  the  combination  therapy  group  in  study  BRF113220  Part  C  were 
pyrexia,  chills,  fatigue,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  the  incidences  of  these  AEs  in 
the combination  therapy  group  were  higher  than  the  incidences  in  the  dabrafenib monotherapy  group.  
Among the 5 most common AEs in the dabrafenib monotherapy group (fatigue, rash, arthralgia, alopecia 
and  headache),  the  incidence  of  alopecia  was  higher  (>10%)  than  the incidence  in  the  combination 
therapy group. 
The  list  of  grade  3  and  4  events  in  the  combination  arms  compared  with  dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib  is 
presented in Table 31. Grade 3 events occurred in the combination therapy arms in 40% of the patients 
in  study  MEK115306  and  approximately  one-half  of  the  patients  in  study  MEK116513.  Pyrexia  and 
hypertension  were  the  most  common  Grade  3  events  in  the  combination  therapy  arms  of  both  studies.

Grade 4 events were reported for 5%, 4% and 7% of patients treated with the combination treatment in 
both  studies,  dabrafenib  and  vemurafenib  arm  respectively.  Thus,  grade  4  events  were  slightly  more 
commonly  reported  for  vemurafenib  than  for  the  other  treatments  and dominated  by  hepatic laboratory 
events. 
Grade  3  events  were  reported  for  40-48%  of  subjects  in  the  combination  arms,  46%  in  the  dabrafenib 
arm,  and  57%  in  the  vemurafenib  arm.  The  preferred  terms  (  PTs)  reported  in  ≥5%  of  subjects  in  at 
least  1  study  arm  were  pyrexia  (4-7%),  hypertension  (6-14%)  and  neutropenia  (3-5%)  for  the 
combination  treatment  compared  to  hypertension  (6%),  basal  cell  carcinoma  (6%)  and  squamous  cell 
carcinoma  of  skin  (5%)  for  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm,  and  rash  (9%),  hypertension  (9%), 
squamous cell carcinoma (9%), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (5%) and keratoacanthoma (9%) for the 
vemurafenib  arm.  Thus,  grade  3  events  were  more  commonly  reported  for  patients  treated  with 
vemurafenib.  Monotherapy  with  either  dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib  was  associated  with  more  events 
related to hyperproliferative states of the skin than combined BRAF and MEK inhibition therapy.  
In  the  combination  therapy  group  in  study  BRF113220  Part  C,  neutropenia  was  the  most  frequently 
reported Grade ≥3 AE. In the dabrafenib monotherapy group, the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 AEs 
were SCC (cutaneous) and fatigue. 
Table 32 summarises the adverse events for which it was considered that there is sufficient evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship with the administration of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs  including  protocol  specified  events  occurred  in  approximately  40%  of  patients  in  the  combination 
therapy  arms  of  both  studies.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  (35-42%)  and  SAEs  considered  related  to  the 
investigational  product  by  the  investigator  (25-30%)  were  similar  across  all  4  treatment  arms  for  both 
studies.  
Pyrexia  was  the  most  common  SAE  in  the  combination  therapy  arms,  followed  by  ejection  fraction 
decreased and chills for both studies.

Events were reported under either preferred term, both denote squamous cell cancer occurring in the skin 
Deaths 
Fewer  patients  died  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  compared  with  the  respective  monotherapy  arm  in 
both studies. The primary cause of death in all treatment arms was disease under study, and most of the 
deaths occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  
No patients in the combination therapy or vemurafenib arms had fatal SAEs that were considered related 
to study treatment by the investigator, the 1 fatal SAE in the dabrafenib arm was considered related by 
the investigator.

Table 34: 
Fatal adverse events in MEK115306 and MEK116513 (Safety Population) 
A subject in Study MEK115306 was initially reported as having a cerebrovascular accident, which was identified as 
a. 
cerebral haemorrhage as the admission CT scan and on later autopsy 
this event has been updated to “unknown” post data cut-off 
b. 
c. 
a subject in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm of MEK115306 had an SAE of bile duct adenocarcinoma that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment; this event was corrected to a fatal SAE post data cut-off 
In study BRF113220 Part C, four fatal SAEs were reported for the combination therapy arm (vs 0 in the 
dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm):  2  patients  with  intracranial  haemorrhage  (in  1  patient  with  grade  4 
thrombocytopenia  and  1  patient  likely  on  post  pulmonary  embolism  treatment),  1  with  cerebrovascular 
accident, and 1 with pulmonary embolism. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest and additional events of interest include events that are either known 
class  effects,  were  identified  pre-clinically  or  in  prior  clinical  studies,  or  are  potentially  life  threatening. 
The AEs of special interest are presented in Table 35.  
Adverse events of special interest and additional events of interest in both treatment arms in MEK115306 
and MEK116513 were primarily Grades 1 and 2 with the exception of malignancies and PE/DVT. 
The AEs of special interest and additional events of interest with the highest incidence of Grade 3 events 
(defined  as  ≥5%  difference  to  the  monotherapy  arm)  in  the  combination  arm  of  either  or  both  studies 
were hypertension, pyrexia, hepatic events and neutropenia. In study MEK115306, the incidence of Grade 
3 events for pyrexia and hepatic events were higher (≥5% difference) in the combination arm than in the 
dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm.    In  study  MEK116513,  pyrexia,  hypertension  and  neutropenia  were 
reported more frequently in the combination arm than in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm.

first  occurrence  was  29-38  days  with  a  median  duration  of  3  days;  the  event  occurred  at  ≥3  events  in 
22-33% of subjects on the combination arm vs 2-7% of the monotherapy BRAF inhibitor arms. No grade 
4  event  was  reported  but  11-14%  of  patients  on  the  combination  were  hospitalised  due  to  pyrexia, 
compared to 5% for dabrafenib monotherapy and 1% for vemurafenib. 
Median  time  to  onset  for  the  first  occurrence  of  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma  was  139-223 
days with combination treatment vs 60-63 days with the monotherapy BRAF inhibitor arms. The incidence 
of  Grade  3  events  was  higher  (≥5%  difference)  for  cuSCC  in  the  dabrafenib  arm  compared  with  the 
combination  therapy  arm  in  MEK115306.  In  MEK116513  the  incidences  of  Grade  3  events  were  higher 
(≥5%  difference)  for  cuSCC  and  skin-related  toxicities  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  compared  with  the 
combination therapy arm.  
New  primary  melanoma  was  reported  in  2%  of  patients  in  the  monotherapy  arms  vs  ≤1%  in  the 
combination population. 
Other  treatment-emergent  malignancies  were  reported  in  3%  of  patients  on  the  monotherapy 
dabrafenib arm vs ≤1-1% of patients on the other arms with median time to onset of 239-330 days for 
the combination, 160 days for dabrafenib monotherapy and 88 days for vemurafenib. In total, 1 patient 
on combination treatment was discontinued from therapy due to the event. 
Bleeding  events  were  more  commonly  reported  on  dabrafenib-containing  regimens;  combination  18-
19%,  monotherapy  dabrafenib  15%  and  7%  for  vemurafenib  with  epistaxis  grade  <3  being  the

predominant PT for all dabrafenib-containing arms. Grade 3 events were reported for 1-2% of patients on 
combination  treatment.  Median  time  to  onset  of  1st  event  was  94  days  for  the  combination.  Of  note,  3 
fatal  events  were  reported  for  the  combination  in  each  of  the  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  studies,  all 
intracranial  haemorrhage,  vs  none  in  the  monotherapy  treatment  arms.  For  5  of  the  6  fatal  cases  of 
intracranial  haemorrhage  there  were  confounding  factors  including  the  use  of  anticoagulant  therapy  (2 
subjects), presence of brain metastases (2 subjects), and cerebral haemorrhage after a fall in a setting of 
grade 3 thrombocytopenia (1 subject).  
Cardiac-related events, all due to EF decreased or LV dysfunction/cardiac failure, were more common 
in the dabrafenib-containing treatment arms (5-8%) than in the vemurafenib arm (<1%) but no grade 4 
event  occurred.  Median  time  to  first  occurrence  was  88-157  days  for  the  combination  and  123  days  for 
dabrafenib monotherapy with a duration of first occurrence of 24-27 days and 43 days, respectively. One 
or  both  study  treatments  were  withdrawn  due  to  cardiac-related  events  for  ≤3%  of  subjects  in  the 
combination therapy arms and for <1% in the dabrafenib arm. Regarding EF, higher fractions of patients 
on  the  combination  than  on  dabrafenib  monotherapy  met  dose  interruption  criteria  (EF  decrease  >10% 
from baseline and below the institutional LLN), 5-7% vs 2%. 
Hypertension  was  more  common  on  combination  treatment  (26-27%)  and  vemurafenib  (26)  than  on  
dabrafenib  (17%)  with  grade  3  events  occurring  in  6-14%  of  patients  on  combination  treatment;  no 
grade  4  event  was  reported  for  dabrafenib-containing  therapy.  Median  time  to  onset  of  first  occurrence 
was  56-58  days  for  the  combination,  with  a  median  duration  of  27-29  days;  ≥3  occurrences  were 
reported  for  3%  of  patients;  no  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  the  event  was  reported  for  the 
combination therapy arms or the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. 
Ocular  events  were  reported  at  similar  frequencies  for  all  study  arms,  11-13%,  with  grade  3  events 
occurring  in  up  to  1%  in  the  combination  and  vemurafenib  arms;  no  grade  4  events  were  reported; 
discontinuation of study treatment was reported for <1% of patients.  
Six  patients  (1%),  whereof  1  grade  3,  in  the  combination  therapy  arms,  1  patient  (<1%)  in  the 
vemurafenib arm, and no patients in the dabrafenib arm had pneumonitis events reported. 
Skin-related  toxicities,  mainly  rash,  were  more  common  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  (77%;  grade  3  in 
16%) than in the combination arms (45-48%; grade 3 in <1-2%) and the dabrafenib monotherapy arm 
(53%; grade 3 in 2%). Study treatment discontinuation due to the event was noted in the vemurafenib 
arm, 1%. 
Diarrhoea was more common in the vemurafenib arm (38%) and the trametinib-containing study arms 
(30-32%)  than  in  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  (16%).  With  combination  treatment,  the  median 
duration  of  the  first  event  was  3  days  and  ≥3  events  were  recorded  in  3-5%  of  these  patients;  dose 
reduction was reported for up to 1% of patients. 
Regarding  hepatic  events,  GGT  was  not  routinely  collected  in  the  MEK115306  study,  most  likely 
contributing  to  the  higher  incidence  of  hepatic  events  noted  in  the  MEK116513  study.  Grade  3  events 
were  reported  for  7-9%  of  patients  on  combination  treatment,  1%  of  patients  on  dabrafenib 
monotherapy, and 10% of patients on the vemurafenib arm; the corresponding figures for grade 4 events 
were 0-<1%, <1% and 2%. Study treatment was discontinued due to the event in up to 2% of patients 
on combination treatment, and dose reduction noted in up to 4% of patients. None of the 6 patients with 
concurrent specified increases of ALT and bilirubin on combination treatment fulfilled Hy’s law vs 3/12 in 
the  vemurafenib  arm.  Out  of  10  patients  on  combination  treatment  that  developed  ALT  ≥8x  ULN 
(stopping criterion) 3 were negatively re-challenged.  
No patient on combination treatment discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity.

Oedema was more common with combination treatment (18-25%; grade 3 <1-1%; median time to 1st 
occurrence  113-130  days,  median  duration  of  1st  occurrence  29-37  days)  than  with  dabrafenib 
monotherapy  (11%)  or  vemurafenib  (13%).  Discontinuation  due  to  the  event  and  dose  reduction  were 
reported in <1% of patients on combination treatment. 
Neutropenia was more common with combination treatment (14%; grade 3 in 4-7%; grade 4 in <1%; 
median  time  to  1st  occurrence  50-153  days,  median  duration  of  1st  occurrence  19-27  days)  than  with 
dabrafenib  monotherapy  (4%)  or  vemurafenib  (3%).  Treatment  discontinuation  due  to  the  event  was 
reported for 1 patient on combination therapy, dose reduction for up to3% and dose interruption for up to 
7%. 
Pancreatitis was reported for 3 patients (<1%) on combination treatment whereof 1 of grade 4; no dose 
adjustments were required. 
PE and DVT were reported in 2-3% of patients on combination treatment (grade 3 in 1-2%; grade 4 in 1 
patient;  median  time  to  1st  occurrence  169-280  days,  median  duration  of  1st  occurrence  29-31  days), 
higher  than  noted  for  the  monotherapy  arms  (<1%).  While  dose  interruption  due  to  the  event  was 
reported for 3 patients on combination treatment, no patient had the dose reduced or discontinued study 
treatment. 
Renal  insufficiency  was  reported  in  4-7%  of  patients  on  combination  treatment  (grade  3  in  <1-1%; 
grade 4 in 1 patient; median time to 1st occurrence 108-147 days, median duration of 1st occurrence 4-
16 days) and 2% for patients on the dabrafenib arm, lower than noted for the vemurafenib arm (12%). 
Four patients on combination therapy discontinued treatment due to the event. 
For  the  combination  therapy,  AE  of  QTc  prolongation  was  reported  in  no  patient  in  the  MEK115306 
study and in 5 patients in the MEK116513 study, whereof 4 with an increase  to ≥ 501 msec including 2 
that  also  had  an  increase  >60  msec  from  baseline  that  subsequently  resolved.  QTc  prolongation  was 
reported for 5 patients in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm and 12 patients in the vemurafenib arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry assessments 
In  MEK115306,  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  had  “any  grade” 
increases in hypoalbuminemia (53%, with 1% grade 3, vs 27%), hypokalemia (13%, with 2% grade 3, vs 
10%) and hyponatremia (24%, with 6% grade 3, vs 14%) than in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. For 
the combination arm 1 grade 4 event was reported, hyperglycaemia. 
In MEK116513, a higher percentage of subjects in the combination therapy arm had “any grade” changes 
from baseline in hypoalbuminemia (45%, with <1% grade 3, vs 15%) and hypophosphatemia (39%, with 
7%  grade  3  and  1  grade  4  event,  vs  23%)  than  in  the  vemurafenib  monotherapy  arm,  and  a  lower 
percentage  of  subjects  had  “any  grade”  change  from  baseline  in  creatinine  in  the  combination  therapy 
arm compared with vemurafenib monotherapy (12% vs 35%). For the combination arm 6 grade 4 events 
were reported; creatinine increase (n=1), hyperglycaemia (3), hyponatremia (1), and hypophosphatemia 
(1). 
Haematology assessments 
In MEK115306, the percentage of patients with increases of any grade and to Grade 3 neutropenia from 
baseline  was  higher  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  than  in  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm.  The 
percentage  of  patients  with  increases  to  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  in  haemoglobin,  lymphocyte  count 
decreased, platelets, and leukocytes from baseline were similar between the treatment arms. 
In  MEK116513,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  change  from  baseline  of  any  grade  and  to  Grade  3

neutropenia  and  leukopenia  from  baseline  was  higher  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  than  in  the 
vemurafenib  monotherapy  arm.  The  percentages  of  patients  with  changes  from  baseline  to  Grade  3  or 
Grade  4  in  haemoglobin,  lymphocyte  count  decrease,  and  platelets  decrease  from  baseline  were  similar 
between  the  treatment  arms,  although  the  combination  therapy  arm  showed a  higher  incidence  of  “any 
grade” increase for platelet counts.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The MAH did not submit studies related to drug-drug interactions (see safety discussion).  
Administration  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  in  combination  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the 
exposure of trametinib or of dabrafenib monotherapy (see pharmacology section). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  was  higher  in  the 
combination  therapy  arm  compared  with  the  dabrafenib  arm  for  MEK115306  of  study.  The  proportions 
were similar for the treatment arms in MEK116513. 
AEs leading to discontinuation in ≥1% of the patients were pyrexia and ejection fraction decrease in the 
combination  therapy  arms,  ejection  fraction  decrease  in  the  dabrafenib  arm,  and  arthraligia,  ALT 
increased, and aspartate aminotransferease (AST) increased in the vemurafenib arm.

As of the data cut-off of 20 February 2015, 183 spontaneous SAE reports reporting a total of 292 SAEs in 
patients  receiving  combination  therapy  were  received  (Table  40).  The  most  commonly  affected  body 
system  from  this  analysis  was  the  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  SOC.  Within  this 
SOC,  the  most  common  SAEs  were  death  (n=49),  pyrexia  (n=17),  and  disease  progression  (n=10);  all 
other SAEs in this SOC were reported at a frequency of ≤ 4 events.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  of  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  has  been  evaluated  in  2  Phase  III  studies, 
MEK115306  and  MEK116513,  where  an  analysis  of  the  safety  of  trametinib  in  combination  with 
dabrafenib  was  conducted  in  209 and  350  patients,  respectively,  with  BRAF  V600  mutation  positive 
unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  receiving  trametinib  (2 mg  QD)  and  dabrafenib  (150 mg  BID) 
combination  therapy  (see  section 5.1  combination  therapy).  The  most  common  adverse  reactions  seen 
for  combination  therapy  in  both  studies  at  ≥ 20 %  include  pyrexia,  fatigue,  nausea,  chills,  diarrhoea, 
cough, headache, hypertension, rash, vomiting and arthralgia. In study MEK115306 an additional adverse 
reaction seen at ≥ 20 % includes oedema peripheral. The safety of the combination therapy as reported 
for the phase III studies are supported by the safety results of the combination therapy obtained with the 
phase II study BRF113220 part C. See section 4.8 of the SmPC for the full list of ADRs and description of 
selected ADRs. 
Some ADRs were found to be less frequent in the combination therapy compared to monotherapies. For 
study  MEK115306,  the  most  common  AEs  that  occurred  more  often  in  the  dabrafenib  arm  than  in  the 
combination  therapy  arm,  were  hyperkeratosis  (35%  vs  7%)    and    arthralgia  (31%  vs  26%, 
respectively),  alopecia,  PPES  (hand-foot  syndrome),  palmoplantar  keratoderma  and  skin  papilloma.    In 
MEK116513,  arthralgia,  rash  and  alopecia  occurred  in  ≥30%  of  the  patients  in  the  vemurafenib  arm 
compared  to  the  combination  therapy  arm  (51%  vs  24%,  43%  vs  22%  and  39%  vs  6%,  respectively) 
and  skin  papilloma,  PPES,  hyperkeratosis,  keratosis  pilaris,  pruritus,  dry  skin,  photosensitivity  reaction, 
sunburn  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous)  were  also  reported  more  often  in  the  monotherapy 
arm  than  in  the  combination  therapy  arm.  The  majority  of  the  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous) 
events resolved following excision without dose modification or withdrawal of study drug. 
In  addition,  grade  3  and  4  events  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  in 
MEK115306 (40% vs 46%; 5% vs 4%, respectively). In both MEK115306 and MEK116513 pyrexia (7%, 
4%  respectively)  and  hypertension  (6%,  14%  respectively)  were  among  the  most  commonly  reported 
grade 3 events for patients treated with combination therapy.  However, the incidence of grade 3 events 
for squamous cell carcinoma (cutaneous) in both studies, and rash and keratoacanthoma in MEK116513, 
was lower for combination therapy in comparison to monotherapy BRAF. 
Pyrexia was the most common SAE in the combination arms in both phase III studies (14-17%) but was 
not  fatal,  and  most  events  resolved  without  dose  changes,  around  35%  of  the  patients  had  a  dose 
interruption and in 14% of the patients dosage was reduced because of pyrexia (see section 4.2 for dose 
reduction recommendations).  When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib and the patient’s 
temperature  is  ≥ 38.5oC  please  refer  to  the  dabrafenib  SmPC  (section  4.2)  for  dose  modifications  for 
dabrafenib.  No  dose  modification  of  trametinib  is  required  when  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib. 
Fever  has  been  reported  in  clinical  trials  with  trametinib  as  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with 
dabrafenib  (see  section 4.8).  The  incidence  and  severity  of  pyrexia  are  increased  with  the  combination 
therapy  (see  dabrafenib  SmPC  section  4.4).  In  patients  receiving  trametinib  in  combination  with 
dabrafenib, pyrexia may be accompanied by severe rigors, dehydration, and hypotension which in some 
cases can lead to acute renal insufficiency.  
Another  commonly  reported  SAE  for  patients  treated  with  combination  therapy  in  both  studies  was 
ejection  fraction  decrease  (4-7%).  Trametinib  has  been  reported  to  decrease  LVEF,  when  used  as 
monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  (see  section 4.8).  In  clinical  trials,  the  median  time  to 
onset  of  the  first  occurrence  of  left  ventricular  dysfunction,  cardiac  failure  and  LVEF  decrease  was 
between  2  and  5 months.  No  dose  modification  of  dabrafenib  is  required  when  trametinib  is  taken  in 
combination with dabrafenib.

If  during  treatment  the  QTc  exceeds  500 msec,  please  refer  to  the  dabrafenib  SmPC  (section  4.2)  for 
dose  modifications  for  dabrafenib.  No  dose  modification  of  trametinib  is  required  when  taken  in 
combination  with  dabrafenib.  If  during  treatment  the  QTc  exceeds  500  msec,  please  refer  to  the

Also, in the phase II study BRF113220 Part C two (incidence of 4%) fatal intracranial haemorrhages were 
reported. Like in the intracranial haemorrhage events in the phase III studies, also in these cases of fatal 
SAEs in the BRF113220 study they were not considered drug-related, however the phase II study was an 
open label study which might bias the determination of drug-related AEs  Haemorrhagic events, including 
major  haemorrhagic  events  and  fatal  haemorrhages,  have  occurred  in  patients  taking  trametinib  as 
monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The majority of bleeding events were 
mild. Fatal intracranial haemorrhages have occurred for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 1% 
(3/209) of patients in study MEK115306 and in <1% (3/350) of patients in study MEK116513.  In these 
clinical studies, the median time to onset of the first occurrence of haemorrhagic events was 94 days in 
both studies for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib. The potential for these events in patients 
with  unstable  and/or  symptomatic  brain  metastases  not  established  as  patients  with  these  conditions 
were  excluded  from  clinical  trials.  The  risk  of  haemorrhage  may  be  increased  with  concomitant  use  of 
antiplatelet  or  anticoagulant  therapy.  If  haemorrhage  occurs,  patients  should  be  treated  as  clinically 
indicated. Haemorrhagic events are currently included as an identified risk for the combination therapy in 
the RMP and will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. In addition, the risks of haemorrhagic 
events  will  be  monitored  through  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  where  the  results  of  study 
BRF115532  (COMBI-AD),  a  randomised  double  blind  study  of  dabrafenib  in  combination  with  trametinib 
versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of high risk BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma after 
surgical resection will provide further longterm safety and study BRF117277, a phase II open label study 
of dabrafenib and trametinib in subjects with BRAF mutation positive melanoma that has metastasised to 
the brain. Both studies will focus on safety of patients with haemorrhagic events (see RMP). 
Elevations  in  blood  pressure  have  been  reported  in  association  with  trametinib  as  monotherapy  and  in 
combination  with  dabrafenib,  in  patients  with  or  without  pre-existing  hypertension  (see  SmPC 
section 4.8).  In  addition,  safety  in  patients    with  treatment  refractory  hypertension  defined  as  a  blood 
pressure  of  systolic  >  140  mmHg  and/or  diastolic  >  90  mm  Hg  which  cannot  be  controlled  by 
antihypertensive  therapy  were  excluded  from  study  MEK115306  and  have  been  included  in  the  RMP  as 
missing  information  related  to  trametinib.  This  will  be  monitored  through  routine  risk  minimisation 
measures. 
Pulmonary  embolism  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  has  been  identified  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  potential 
risk  that  can  occur  when  trametinib  is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib.    If  patients  develop 
symptoms  of  pulmonary  embolism  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  such  as  shortness  of  breath,  chest  pain,  or 
arm or leg swelling, they should immediately seek medical care. Permanently discontinue trametinib and 
dabrafenib for life-threatening pulmonary embolism. 
Pulmonary embolism and DVT will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  phase  III  studies  MEK115306  (n=209)  and  MEK116513  (n=350)  with  trametinib  in  combination 
with  dabrafenib  in  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma,  56 patients  (27 %)  and 
77 patients  (22%)  respectively  were  ≥ 65 years  of  age;  11  patients  (5  %)  and  21  patients  (6%) 
respectively  were  ≥  75  years  of  age.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  AEs  was  similar  in  those 
aged  < 65 years  and  those  aged  ≥ 65 years  in  both  studies.  Patients ≥ 65 years  were  more  likely  to 
experience SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and 
dose interruption than those < 65 years. 
Neutropenia and related events was found to be more common with combination treatment (14%) and in 
some patients more severe (grade 3 in 4-7%; grade 4 in 0-<1%) than compared with dabrafenib (4%) or 
Assessment report

vemurafenib (3%) monotherapy. Therefore, neutropenia has been included as an important identified risk 
for combination therapy in the RMP and will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures.  
New malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used in combination with 
dabrafenib.  
Cases  of  cuSCC  (including  keratoacanthoma)  have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  trametinib  in 
combination with dabrafenib. Cases of cuSCC can be managed with excision and do not require treatment 
modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
New  primary  melanoma  was  reported  in  patients  receiving  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib. 
Cases  of  new  primary  melanoma  can  be  managed  with  excision  and  do  not  require  treatment 
modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may increase the risk of non-cutaneous malignancies when 
RAS  mutations  are  present.  When  trametinib  is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  please  refer  to  the 
dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). No dose modification of trametinib is required for RAS mutation positive 
malignancies  when  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib.  Consider  the  benefits  and  risks  before 
continuing  treatment  with  dabrafenib  in  patients  with  a  non-cutaneous  malignancy  that  has  a  RAS 
mutation.  
Dose  modifications  are  not  recommended  for  adverse  reactions  of  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
(cuSCC)  or  new  primary  melanoma  (see  dabrafenib  SmPC  for  further  details).  If  treatment  related 
toxicities  occur  when  trametinib is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  then  both  treatments  should  be 
simultaneously  dose  reduced,  interrupted  or  discontinued.  Exceptions,  where  dose  modifications  are 
necessary  for  only  one  of  the  two  treatments,  are  detailed  below  for  pyrexia,  uveitis,  RAS  mutation 
positive  non  cutaneous  malignancies  and  QT  prolongation  (primarily  related  to  dabrafenib),  left 
ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  reduction,  retinal  vein  occlusion  (RVO),  retinal  pigment  epithelial 
detachment (RPED) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (primarily related to trametinib). 
The risks of non-cutaneous malignancies will be monitored through additional pharmacovigilance activity 
where  the  results  of  study  BRF115532  (COMBI-AD),  a  randomised  double  blind  study  of  dabrafenib  in 
combination  with  trametinib  versus  two  placebos  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  high  risk  BRAFV600 
mutation positive  melanoma  after  surgical  resection  will provide  further longterm  safety  data  with  focus 
on non-cutaneous malignancies. 
No  dose  modifications  are  required  for  uveitis  as  long  as  effective  local  therapies  can  control  ocular 
inflammation.  If  uveitis  does  not  respond  to  local  ocular  therapy,  withhold  dabrafenib  until  resolution  of 
ocular  inflammation  and  then  restart  dabrafenib  reduced  by  one  dose  level.  No  dose  modification  of 
trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.4). 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED): 
In patients who are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib, whether given as monotherapy or in 
combination with dabrafenib, should be permanently discontinued. No dose modification of dabrafenib is 
required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib.  
If uveitis is diagnosed, please refer to dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4. In patients who are diagnosed with 
RVO, treatment with trametinib should be permanently discontinued. No dose modification of dabrafenib 
is  required  when  taken  in  combination  with  trametinib  following  diagnosis  of  RVO  or  RPED.  No  dose 
modification  of  trametinib  is  required  when  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  following  diagnosis  of 
uveitis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015

Disorders  associated  with  visual  disturbance,  including  RPED  and  RVO,  may  occur  with  trametinib  as 
monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. In clincial trials uveitis and iridocyclitis have also been 
reported in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib. 
No  dose  modification  of  dabrafenib  is  required  when  trametinib  is  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib 
for cases of ILD or pneumonitis. 
In  a  Phase  III  trial,  2.4 %  (5/211)  of  patients  treated  with  trametinib  monotherapy  developed  ILD  or 
pneumonitis;  all  five  patients  required  hospitalisation.  The  median  time  to  first  presentation  of  ILD  or 
pneumonitis  was  160 days  (range:  60  to  172 days).  In  studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  < 1 % 
(2/209) and 1% (4/350), respectively, of patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib 
developed  pneumonitis  or  ILD  (see  section  4.8).  If  trametinib  is  being  used  in  combination  with 
dabrafenib then therapy with dabrafenib may be continued at the same dose. 
Trametinib  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment  when 
administered as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. 
Hepatic  adverse  events  have  been  reported  in  clinical  trials  with  trametinib  as  monotherapy  and  in 
combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). 
Rash has been observed in about 60 % of patients in trametinib monotherapy studies and in about 25% 
of  patients  in  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  combination  studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  (see 
section 4.8). 
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib  (see  section  4.8)  and  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  identified  risk. 
Rhabdomyolysis will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures. 
Renal  failure  has  been  identified  in  patients  treated  with  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  in 
clinical studies. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4). 
Pancreatitis  has  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  in 
clinical studies. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4).  
In  non-clinical  studies,  the  monotherapies  have  been  shown  to  have  developmental  toxicity  and 
teratogenic effects. In addition, the use of dabrafenib may render hormonal contraceptives less effective 
and  therefore  an  alternative  method  of  contraception,  such  as  barrier  methods,  should  be  used  when 
trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. 
Effects  on  spermatogenesis  have  been  observed  in  animals  given  dabrafenib.  Male  patients  taking 
trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  should  be  informed  of  the  potential  risk  for  impaired 
spermatogenesis, which may be irreversible. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information. 
The percentage of patients treated with combination therapy who discontinued treatment due to AEs was 
11%  in  the  MEK115306  and  13%  in  the  MEK116513  study  suggesting  that  the  combination  therapy  is 
well tolerated.  Recommendations on treatment adjustments and management of ADRs that require dose 
reduction,  treatment  interruption  or  treatment  discontinuation,  are  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4,2 
(Table 1 and 2.  
In  clinical  trials  with  the  combination  of  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  11  patients  reported  trametinib 
overdose (4mg); no SAEs were reported.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  submitted  do  not  show  any  serious  unexpected  adverse  reactions  with  the  combination 
treatment  dabrafenib/trametinib  compared  with  dabrafenib  and/or  vemurafenib.  The  ADRs  were  in 
Assessment report

general  comparable  to  monotherapy,  although  slightly  higher  than  the  adverse  events  observed  for  the 
MEK and BRAF inhibitors in monotherapy and were manageable either through dose interruption or dose 
reduction.  The  greatest  differences  in  incidences  were  seen  for  pyrexia  and  chills,  which  were  more 
frequently  reported  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  than  with 
dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib  monotherapy.  In  contrast  the  incidence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cuSCC) 
and  keratoacanthoma  was  lower  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  than  in  the  monotherapy  arm  of  both 
studies. The risk of and actual occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma is an important additive burden for 
patients.  Therefore a decrease of the incidence of this AE is considered an advantage of the combination 
therapy.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMPs. 
On 9th July 2015 the PRAC considered by consensus that Mekinist (trametinib) RMP version 11 (dated 30 
March  2015)  and  Tafinlar  (dabrafenib)  RMP  version  7.0  (dated  27  March  2015)  could  be  acceptable, 
provided  that  updated  versions  of  these  documents  and  satisfactory  responses  to  the  agreed  List  of 
Questions (LOQ) are submitted. The PRAC advice is attached. 
On  15th  July  2015  the  Applicant  submitted  a  satisfactory  response  to  the  LOQ,  together  with  updated 
versions  of  the  RMPs  for  trametinib  (version  11.1,  dated  14th  July  2015)  and  dabrafenib  (version  7.1, 
dated 14th July 2015).

Overall comment 
The  proposed  risk  minimisation  measures  for  both  trametinib  or  dabrafenib  monoterapy  and  the 
combination therapy remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the products in the proposed indication.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  As the MEKINIST PL from initial MAA contained language for the co-administration of both trametinib 
and dabrafenib when the readability testing was conducted and was found to be acceptable, there is 
no further consultation with target patient groups is required for the PL included. 
• 
The  TAFINLAR  PL  was  approved  with  initial  MAA  on  26th  August  2013.  The  information  proposed  in 
the  PL  submitted  with  this  variation  contain  minimal  changes,  maintaining  the  currently  approved 
layout and format and is not considered to require further consultation with target patient groups.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The study MEK115306 showed a PFS with a HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53, 0.84; p<0.001) and a prolongation 
of  median  PFS  of  2.2  months  (11.0  months  for  the  combination  therapy  arm  and  8.8  months  for  the 
monotherapy arm).  The updated OS results also showed a statistically significant difference with a HR = 
0.71 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.92, p=0.011) for OS in favour of the combination therapy. The PFS and OS results 
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015 
Page 112/118 
 
  
  
 
were  considered  clinical  relevant.  Subgroup  analysis  and  sensitivity  analysis  (OS  and  PFS  analysis  with 
Cox  model  accounting  for  significant  prognostic  factor  like  ECOG  score,  visceral  disease,  number  of 
disease sites and gender) demonstrated consistent results in the ITT population.  The robustness of the 
data was supported by the study MEK116513, which showed similar results (see clinical discussion). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  both  phase  III  studies,  patients  who  did  not  receive  previous  treatment  for  metastatic  disease  were 
included in the study population. Phase II study BRF113220 included a low number of patients who had 
progressive disease on dabrafenib monotherapy.  Of these patients (cross over population) around 10% 
showed  responses  on  combination  therapy  after  they  had  progressive  disease  with  dabrafenib 
monotherapy.    It  was  noted  that  the  efficacy  observed  in  pre-treated  patients  with  BRAF  inhibitors  was 
lower  than  in  naïve  patients  who  had  not  received  prior  BRAF  inhibitor  therapy.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  efficacy  data  for  combination  therapy  in  patients  that  progressed  on  prior  BRAF 
inhibitor monotherapy was too limited to draw any conclusion. However, it is acknowledged that patients 
may still derive some benefit from the combination therapy. Therefore, the indication was not restricted 
but a warning statement on the lower efficacy in this patient population has been included in section 4.4 
and 5.1 of the SmPC.    
It  is  uncertain  which  sequencing  of  treatment  may  be  best  for  melanoma  patients  as  new  emerging 
treatments for melanoma (eg immunotherapies) have been recently been approved that may change the 
landscape of treatment strategies and clinical paradigms in the management of melanoma patients. Thus, 
a  statement  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  advise  prescribers  that  other  treatment 
options  could  be  considered  before  treatment  with  the  combination  in  this  prior  BRAF  inhibitor  treated 
population and that sequencing of treatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not 
been established.   
Patients  with  brain  metastases  were  not  included  in  the  studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  and  no 
further  data  is  available.  There  is  a  study  ongoing  which  will  examine  the  efficacy  of  the  combination 
therapy  in  patients  with  active  brain  metastases  (COMBI-MB)  and  this  has  been  included  as  a  post-
authorisation  commitment  in  the  RMP.  The  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  include  a  warning  in  section  4.4 
and information on the lack of patients with brain metastases in section 5.1. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Pyrexia  was  the  most  common  AE  in  the  combination  therapy  arms  and  this  adverse  event  occurred  in 
approximately one half of the patients receiving combination therapy in both studies.  
Nausea,  chills  and  diarrhoea  also  occurred  in  ≥30%  of  the  patients  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  of 
both MEK115306 and MEK116513 with comparable incidences. ADRs that required special warning in the 
SmPC  were  new  malignancies  (cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinomas,  new  primary  melanoma,  non-
cutaneous  malignancies),  haemorrhage,  LVEF  reduction/left  ventricular  dysfunction,  pyrexia,  deep  vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), hypertension, visual impairment, rash, rhabdomyolysis, renal 
failure, pancreatitis, QT prolongation and hepatic events. These  ADRs are managed through appropriate 
recommendations in the SmPC and monitored with routine risk minimisation measures.  
Squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  skin  (cuSCC)  was  reported  more  frequently  in  the  BRAF  inhibitor 
monotherapy  arms  than  in  the  combination  therapy  arms  (4-10%  for  dabrafenib  monotherapy  and 
vemurafenib  monotherapy  vs  <1%  for  the  combination  therapy).    The  incidence  of  Grade  3  events  for 
rash, squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and keratoacanthoma was also lower in the combination therapy 
arms  in  comparison  to  monotherapy  arms  (rash  0-15  vs  2-13%,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  1  vs  5-10%, 
keratoacanthoma  1  vs  2-9%).  The  majority  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous)  events  resolved

following excision without dose modification or withdrawal of study drug.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Six  patients  in  the  phase  III  studies  treated  with  combination  therapy  died  due  to  bleeding  events  and 
two  cases  (4%)  were  also  reported  in  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  Part  C.  Although  none  of  these 
events  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigator,  the  contribution  of  trametinib 
and/or dabrafenib to haemorrhages could not be ruled out. Therefore, haemorrhagic events are included 
in  the  RMP  as  identified  risks  and  management  of  these  events  will  be  performed  through  the 
recommendations in the SmPC and monitoring through routine risk minimisation measures.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  prognosis  of  patients  with  advanced  melanoma  is  still  poor,  in  spite  of  recently  approved  new 
therapies.  The  combination  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation has demonstrated clinical benefit in a 
patient population with a  high unmet need. The results for OS and PFS  were  statistically significant and 
clinically relevant. This is supported by ORR and DoR data.  
Overall,  combination  treatment  is  associated  with  a higher  incidence of ADRs,  including  grade  3  events. 
However,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  combination  treatment  is  considered  acceptable  and 
manageable.  In  addition,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cuSCC)  and 
keratoacanthoma seemed to be lower than that observed with monotherapy treatment. The risk and the 
actual  occurrence  of  cuSCC  is  an  important  additive  burden  for  patients.  Therefore  the  decreased 
incidence of such squamous cell carcinoma is considered a benefit of the combination therapy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the benefits of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation outweigh the risks. Therefore, the 
CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The  combination  of  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  is  supported  by  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  where 
blocking the MAPK kinase pathway at two separate levels is expected to improve efficacy. The strength of 
the  evidence  has  been  shown  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  where  a  clinically 
relevant improvement in PFS and OS has been demonstrated. Both studies included patients who had not 
been  previously  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors.  For  patients  who  were  treated  with  a  BRAF  inhibitor  as 
monotherapy  (dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib),  only  limited  efficacy  data  exist  and  the  response  rates  in 
patients who had progressed after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor was lower than for patients that were 
previously untreated. Taking into account that in clinical practice, a proportion of patients will have been 
previously  treated  with  other  BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitors,  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  the  combination 
treatment may not provide the same clinical benefit in those patients as what has been observed in the 
clinical  trials  which  enrolled  naïve  patients  not  previously  treated  with  MAPK  kinase  pathway  inhibitors 
and that clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in this patient population. Nevertheless, the indication 
was  not  restricted  as  it  was  considered  that  patients  previously  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors  could  still 
derive some benefit from the combination therapy. 
New therapeutic options have been approved recently for melanoma, some targeting the immune system 
instead  of  the  melanoma  cancer  cells.  Immunotherapeutic  agents  such  as  ipilimumab,  pembrolizumab 
and nivolumab are not thought to interfere with the RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK signalling pathway and with the 
BRAF  mutation  status.  However,  based  on  the  current  data  and 
information  available,  no 
recommendation can be given over the sequencing of therapies.  
The safety and tolerability of the combination therapy appears to be manageable and there were no new 
unexpected ADRs observed in the safety database during the conduct of the two pivotal studies.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  or  modification  of  an 
approved one  
Extension  of  indication  to add  a  new therapeutic  indication  for the  use in  combination  of trametinib  and 
dabrafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF 
V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. An updated RMP was also provided. 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
• 
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  shall  submit  periodic  safety  update  reports  for  this  product  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  set  out in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates (EURD  list)  )  provided  for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the same 
time. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Assessment report  
EMA/589140/2015 
Page 117/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The  PRAC  considers  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  necessary  for  the  safe  and 
effective use of the medicinal products. The CHMP endorsed this advice. 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
No conditions are necessary.  
Market exclusivity 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  MAH,  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication for both 
Mekinist and Tafinlar brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 
1). 
5.   EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension  of  indication  to add  a  new therapeutic  indication  for the  use  in  combination  of  trametinib  and 
dabrafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF 
V600  mutation  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1).  As  a  consequence,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.5,  4.6,  4.8,  5.1, 
5.3  of  the  SmPC  are  updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  was  updated  accordingly.  Furthermore,  an  updated 
Mekinist (trametinib) RMP version 11.1 and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) RMP version 7.1 was approved as part of 
the application.

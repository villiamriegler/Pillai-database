Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tozinameran (COMIRNATY), 
tozinameran/riltozinameran (COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.1), tozinameran/famtozinameran 
(COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4-5), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on myocarditis and pericarditis from the literature and spontaneous reports, the 
PRAC considers that the current warning on this risk should be amended to reflect the clinical course and 
outcome (including very rare fatal outcome) of Comirnaty associated myocarditis/pericarditis. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing tozinameran, tozinameran/riltozinameran, 
tozinameran/famtozinameran should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tozinameran (COMIRNATY), tozinameran/riltozinameran 
(COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.1), tozinameran/famtozinameran (COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4-
5) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
tozinameran (COMIRNATY), tozinameran/riltozinameran (COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.1), 
tozinameran/famtozinameran (COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4-5) is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Introduction 
The company requested a new indication in the “Prevention of VTE in patients undergoing abdominal 
surgery who are at risk of thromboembolic complications”. The application is supported by a single 
double-blind, dalteparin-controlled pivotal study, PEGASUS (EFC3357). No Scientific Advice was 
sought to discuss the design of the trial. 
2. 
Clinical aspects. 
Rationale for the proposed change 
DVT  and  PE  are  potentially  life-threatening  events  following  major  abdominal  surgery.  Current 
knowledge  about  the  epidemiology  of  post-operative  VTE  in  abdominal  surgery  is  mainly  based  on 
published studies assessing the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using no treatment 
or  placebo-treated  control  groups.  The  reported  rates  of  DVT  detected  by  screening  procedures, 
clinical VTE and clinical PE are about 15%, 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. 
The  seventh  ACCP  guidelines  (American  College  of  Chest  Physicians,  2004)  for  antithrombotic 
therapy  agreed  on  the  following  risk  factors  for  VTE:  surgery,  trauma  (major  or  lower  extremities), 
immobility, paresis, malignancy, cancer therapy, previous VTE, increasing age, pregnancy and post-
partum, estrogen use, acute medical illness, heart and respiratoy failure, inflammatory bowel disease, 
nephrotic  syndrome,  myeloproliferative  disorders,  paroxysmal  nocturanal  hemoglobinuria,  obesity, 
smoking,  varicose  veins,  central  venous  catheterisation,  inherited  or  acquired  thrombophilia.  "High 
risk" was defined as follows:  
Table 1 Levels of thromboembolism risk in surgical patients without prophylaxis, 7th ACCP guidelines 
''High risk'' 
Surgery in patients >60 years or age 40-60 with additional risk 
factors(prior VTE, cancer, molecular hypercoagulability) 
Surgery in patients with multiple risk factors( age >40 years , cancer, 
prior VTE); hip or knee arthroplasty, hip fracture surgery; major trauma; 
spinal cord injury 
''Highest risk'' 
Based  on  numerous  trials  it  is  generally  accepted  that  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH)  and  LMWH 
reduce  the  rate  of  post-operative VTE  with  a  relative  reduction  of  approximately  50%  or  more,  and 
appear to be approximately equally efficacious and safe in preventing VTE in general surgery patients.  
The residual incidence of surveillance DVT or VTE with LMWH prophylaxis in general surgery has 
been reported to be in the range of 6% to 15% (as assessed in 3 active-controlled published studies by 
Bergqvist  in  1986,  1988  and  1995,  and  the  ENOXACAN  study),  with  higher  rates  in  patients  with 
malignancy. 
Analysis of data submitted 
PEGASUS  was  a  Phase III,  multicentre,  multinational,  randomised,  parallel-group  double-blind 
(double-dummy)  and  active-controlled  study  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  fondaparinux  2.5 
mg once-daily sc injection with dalteparin (Fragmin) 5000 IU once-daily sc injection, up to Day 10, in 
the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery. 
Clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has adequately justified bioequivalence between the 12.5 mg/ml formulation used in the 
clinical  trial  and  the  5  mg/ml  intended  for  marketing  by  bridging  two  bioequivalence  studies.  It  has 
been  shown  that  fondaparinux  concentration,  volume  of  injection  and  sodium  content  of  the 
formulation do not affect the bioavailability of fondaparinux and the 2 formulations can be considered 
bioequivalent. 
The  fondaparinux  dose  selected  in  this  study  was  the  same  as  that  approved  for  prophylaxis  in  the 
MOSLL development programme. The dalteparin regimen used in the control group (2500 IU 2 hours 
pre-operatively and 12 hours after the pre-operative injection, and then 5000 IU once daily up to day 
7±2) is approved and widely accepted for prophylaxis of patients at increased risk in general surgery.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients were screened from 30 days prior to surgery. Randomisation was to be performed at least 2 
hours  before  anaesthesia  induction  for  surgery  (Day  1)  and  not  more  than  24  hours  before  the  pre-
operative injection. Patients were to be treated up to Day 7±2. A mandatory bilateral venogram had to 
be performed between Day 5 and Day 10, or earlier in case of symptomatic VTE, and in any case not 
more  than  one  calendar  day  after  the  last  study  treatment  injection.  Patients  were  then  followed-up 
from Day 11 up to Day 30±2.

Basic  inclusion  criteria  selected  patients  undergoing  abdominal  surgery  under  general  anesthesia* 
(*spinal/epidural anesthesia were however  allowed through an amendment during the study), planned 
to  last  longer  than  45  min  (from  incision  to  incision  closure),  and  satisfying  one  of  the  following 
conditions: 
−  over 60 years old with or without any other risk factor for VTE; 
−  over 40 years old and at risk for thromboembolic complications [patients who were obese (BMI>30 
kg/m2 for men and 28.6 kg/m2 for women), or undergoing cancer surgery, or with a history of DVT 
or PE, or with congestive heart failure (NYHA grade III or IV), or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, or inflammatory bowel disease]. 
The exclusion criteria were mainly related to contraindications to dalteparin use, known bleeding risk, 
creatinine above 2.0 mg/dl (180 micromol/L), difficulties in performing venography and patients for 
whom  anticoagulant  therapy  was  indicated  due  to  a  co-existing  condition.  Patients  undergoing 
urological (except kideney) or gynaecological surgery,  laparoscopic surgery, emergency post-trauma 
surgery, and patients undergoing vascular surgery were also excluded. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  composite  of  the  following  VTE  outcomes:  (i)  mandatory 
venogram positive for any DVT between Day 5 and Day 10, (ii) symptomatic DVT and/or non-fatal 
PE,  and  (iii)  fatal  PE.  A  “non-evaluable”  or  no  VTE  assessment  up  to  Day 10  (i.e.)  was  the  only 
reason  for  exclusion  from  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  the 
components of the primary efficacy outcome considered separately during the same time period: DVT 
(any,  proximal,  and  distal  only)  and  symptomatic  VTE  (DVT  and/or  PE).  Additional  efficacy 
outcomes  were  symptomatic  VTE  up  to  Day  32  and  initiation  of  curative  treatment  based  on  local 
VTE assessment. 
The main safety endpoint was the incidence of major bleeding (MB) during the treatment period. MB 
was defined as: (i) a fatal bleeding, or (ii) bleeding at the surgical site leading to intervention, or (iii) 
non-surgical  bleeding  at  a  critical  site  (e.g.,  intracranial,  retroperitoneal,  intra-ocular,  pericardial, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spinal or into adrenal gland), or leading to intervention, and/or with a bleeding index (BI)1 ≥2. Other 
safety  variables  were:  major  bleedings  between  first  injection  and  Day  32,  minor  bleeding  (i.e. 
clinically  overt  bleeding  not  meeting  the  criteria  of  MB),  transfusion  requirements,  adverse  events 
(AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and changes in laboratory parameters. 
The  "primary  efficacy  population"  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients  with  a  non-missing  primary 
efficacy outcome.  Patients were  analysed “as randomised” in all efficacy analyses, and according to 
the  treatment  actually  received  (i.e.,  “as  treated”)  in  all  safety  analyses.  The  following  periods  were 
used in efficacy and safety analyses: 
-  main  efficacy  period:  from  the  first  study  drug  injection  or  the  day  of  surgery  (whichever 
occurred  first)  up  to  the  first  venogram  or  up  to  Day 10  (whichever  occurred  first),  both  days 
included. This period was used for primary efficacy outcome and secondary efficacy parameters; 
treatment period: from the first study drug injection up to 2 calendar days after the last study drug 
injection. This period was the main period for safety analyses; 
- 
-  whole  study  period:  from  the  first  study  drug  injection  up  to  Day 32.  This  period  was  used  for 
symptomatic VTE and also for safety analyses. 
A Central Independent Adjudication Committee (CIAC), whose members were unaware of treatment 
assignment,  adjudicated  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes.  Accumulated  safety  data  were  reviewed  at 
regular intervals by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
Exploratory  analyses  included  baseline  covariate  analysis  [country,  gender,  race,  age,  obesity,  BMI, 
site  of  surgery,  type  of  surgery,  type  of  anesthesia,  duration  of  surgery  from  incision  up  to  incision 
closure,  medical  history/risk  factors  for  VTE  and  baseline  creatinine  clearance  (Clcr,  calculated 
according  to  Cockroft  and  Gault)].  For  each  subgroup,  point  estimates  and  95%  CIs  per  treatment 
group were calculated, as well as 95% 2-sided CIs on the differences between the 2 treatment groups 
(fondaparinux  sodium  -  dalteparin).  A  stepwise  multiple  logistic  regression  analysis  was  planned  in 
order to test the treatment effect adjusted for the covariate prognostic factors taking into account the 
correlated nature of these variables. 
Additional  exploratory  analyses  were  performed  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  consisting  of 
sensitivity  analyses.  These  analyses  considered  3  scenarios:  "best  case  scenario"  (all  randomised 
patients  without  evaluation  for  primary  endpoint  were  considered  as  "no  VTE"  patients);  "realistic 
scenario" (the VTE rate for all randomised patients with a missing primary endpoint in any of the 2 
groups  was  assumed  to  be  the  observed  VTE  rate)  and  "worst  scenario"  (all  randomised  patients 
without evaluation for the primary endpoint were considered as "VTE patients").  
The  primary  efficacy  outcome  was  further  analysed  according  to  selected  concomitant  medications 
which were reported to have a potential interaction with heparin according to the US Physicians’ Desk 
Reference 1999. 
Regarding the estimation of the sample size, the VTE rate in the control group was expected to be at 
least  7%  based  on  previous  studies  in  VTE  prevention.  The  study  was  initially  designed  for  a 
superiority  analysis  and  a  risk  reduction  of  40%  with  fondaparinux  treatment  was  targeted.  With  a 
total of 2000 evaluable (non-missing efficacy assessment) patients, i.e. 1000 per group, the power to 
detect a significant difference (bilateral, α=0.05)  between  the  dalteparin  group  and the fondaparinux 
group was greater than 75%. Thus, it was planned to randomise 2,900 patients in this study, estimating 
that 30% of patients would have a missing VTE evaluation. 
During the conduct of the study, and prior to unblinding, as it appeared that the overall VTE rate was 
lower  than  the  expected  VTE  rate,  the  Steering  Committee  decided  to  modify  the  study  hypothesis 
from a ‘superiority study’ to a ‘non-inferiority study’, keeping the superiority objective in a sequential 
testing approach. A relative non-inferiority margin on the odds ratio (OR) of 1.7 was determined based 
on published literature, corresponding to a non-inferiority margin of 70% for the odds ratio reduction. 
Thus, the sequential procedure was as follows:  
1 BI=Number of units transfused + [pre-bleed hemoglobin (g/dl) – post-bleed hemoglobin (g/dl) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
1.  calculation of the odds ratio (OR) reduction (100 × (OR fondaparinux/dalteparin - 1)) and 95% CI for the 
primary efficacy endpoint. If the upper limit was < 70%, then; 
2.  comparison of the 2 groups using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test at the 0.05 significance level. 
Point estimates and 2-sided 95% CI per treatment group were calculated as well as 2-sided 95% CIs 
on the relative risk (fondaparinux/dalteparin) and difference (fondaparinux – dalteparin).

The  past  medical history and/or VTE risk factors were similar for both treatment groups, with more 
than  73.4%  of  the  patients  with  a  history  of  neoplastic  disease,  and  DVT/PE,  COPD,  CHF, 
prothrombic  states  present  in  3.7%,  7.5%,  4.1%,  and  0.3  %  of  the  patients,  respectively  (data  not 
shown). More than two thirds (69 %) of the patients had cancer surgery (more than half had colonic-
rectal surgery), and the median surgery duration was rather long (2 hours 30 minutes), both of which 
could be expected to contribute to an increased VTE risk. From a safety perspective it should be noted 
that more than one third of patients had a spinal/epidural catheter. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
The  numbers  of  patients  who  received  physical  therapy  for  thromboprophylaxis  (physical  therapy 
and/or elastic stockings) was very similar in both treatment groups (around 65%). 
The mean and median exposure was 7 days, and 97.7% and 97.6% in the fondaparinux sodium group 
and the dalteparin groups, respectively, received study drug for 5-9 days, as required by the protocol. 
The follow-up (a recorded contact after day 28) was almost complete among patients that were treated 
and had not died. The number of patients with active preoperative injections by type of anesthesia 
received is displayed in Table 3.

A total of 33% of dalteparin patients did not receive a pre-operative injection, mainly due to the use of 
a  catheter  for  spinal/epidural  anesthesia  and/or  analgesia  (25.8%),  and  therefore,  according  to  the 
approved dalteparin labelling and as pre-specified in the protocol, no preoperative injection was given. 
The  omission  of  the  pre-operative  dalteparin  dose  is  considered  consistent  with  current  clinical 
practice,  in  which  the  use  of  spinal  anaesthesia  and/or  epidural  catheters  in  abdominal  surgery  is 
common. For the few remaining patients (7.2%) it was due to spinal/epidural anesthesia being planned 
at first but ultimately not being performed, or to the preoperative injection being mistakenly forgotten.

Fondaparinux nominally reduced the risk of VTE in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery, 
from  6.1%  (dalteparin  group)  to  4.6%  (fondaparinux  group),  resulting  in  an  ORR  [CI]  of  -25.8%  
[-49.7%, 9.5%] in favour of fondaparinux. The CI upper limit was much lower than the (very liberal) 
prespecified  70%  limit,  allowing  the  conclusion  that  fondaparinux  is  non-inferior  to  dalteparin 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
according  to  the  study  protocol  criteria.This  difference  was  however  not  statistically  significant  and 
mainly due to a reduction of asymptomatic distal DVT.

Regarding  ancillary  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint,  no  statistically  significant  heterogeneity  of 
treatment effect was  demonstrated for  any covariate analysed except for  obesity (22%  of the patient 
population;  p=0.021)  and  cancer  surgery  (69%  of  the  patient  population;  p=0.022).  In  general,  VTE 
rates remained numerically lower in the fondaparinux group compared with dalteparin when treatment 
effect  was  adjusted  on  the  covariate  prognostic  factors  (especially  in  old  age,  moderate  renal 
impairment and cancer surgery), with the exception of presence of obesity. As expected, overall, risk 
was increased with cancer, with increasing age, with increasing BMI, and with increasing duration of 
surgery. The adjusted percentage ORR for the treatment effect was –31.2% [-54.1%, 3.0%].

The results in the above table suggest that fondaparinux is more effective than dalteparin in the large 
cancer surgery subgroup, which was not the case in the overall PEGASUS population or in the non-
cancer surgery subgroup. The incidence of VTE in the cancer surgery patients treated with dalteparin 
(7.7%)  was broadly comparable  to that  observed in  previous studies. Importantly, fondaparinux  was 
superior  to  dalteparin  in  these  patients,  providing  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
reduction of VTE (4.7%), with a ORR [95% CI] relative to dalteparin of 40.5% [-61.9%, -7.2%], p = 
0.02, p value not adjusted for multiplicity.  
Pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  all  randomised  patients.  In  all  3  scenarios 
considered the non-inferiority criterion on the primary efficacy endpoint was maintained. Further to a 
request  from  CHMP,  the  MAH  conducted  further  sensitivity  analyses  assigning  the  best  possible 
outcome to missing values in the control group and the worst possible outcome to missing values in 
the  experimental  group,  and  vice-versa  (  i.e.  as  per  PtC  on  missing  data,  CPMP/EWP/1776/99). 
However,  given  the  large  relative  difference  between  the  proportion  of  patients  excluded  due  to  a 
missing  VTE  evaluation  (i.e.  30%)  and  the  low  VTE  rate  observed  in  both  groups  (4.6%  for 
fondaparinux  versus  6.1%  for  dalteparin),  little  additional  value  was  gained  from  these  additional 
sensitivity analyses.  
Finally,  no  notable  inconsistencies  of  the  results  were  observed  with  regard  to  the  primary  efficacy 
end-point in the  other subgroups (demographic subgroups, pre-existing disease categories, other risk 
factor groups, study centre or country). The numerical difference between treatments observed in the 
obese subgroup (22 % of the PEGASUS population) does not reach statistical significance. 
As regards secondary enpoints, the rates of symptomatic VTE were similar between treatment groups 
up to the qualifying assessment and up to Day 32. During the whole study period, numerically fewer 
PEs were observed in the fondaparinux sodium group (9 including 4 non-fatal, 5 fatal) compared with 
the  dalteparin  group  (11,  including  9  non-fatal  and  2  fatal  respectively).  The  low  number  of  events 
does not allow any conclusions.

Fatal PE represents a great proportion of the symptomatic VTE events. Of the 14 reported, 13 occurred 
in  patients  with  cancer  (rate  of  0.67%).  The  repartition  in  both  groups  is  as  follows:  0.41%  in  the 
fondaparinux group (4/954) and 0.91% in the dalteparin group. This number of fatal PE is surprisingly 
high  and  is  close  to  the  rate  reported  in  elderly  patients  undergoing  hip  fracture  surgery  in  the 
PENTHIFRA study (0.9%) rather than the rate observed in the ENOXAN study in patients with cancer 
and additional risk factors undergoing digestive surgery (0.2%) - the rate of other symptomatic VTE 
events is quide low and remains similar to that observed in digestive surgery studies.  
The  numbers  of  patients  receiving  curative  treatment  and  prolonged  prophylaxis  of  VTE 
(heparin/LMWH  or  vitamin K  antagonists)  during  the  follow-up  period  were  similar  between  the 
2 treatment groups (36.9% fondaparinux vs. 37.9% dalteparin). It should be noted that the decision to 
initiate antithrombotic prophylaxis therapy following study drug was based on clinical judgement and 
independent of knowledge of the treatment allocation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
Finally, further to a request from CHMP, the MAH reanalysed the data to address some of the CHMP 
concerns. The results of the most relevant reanalyses are shown below  
Table 7 Efficacy results analysed according to the per protocol population, as required in the PtC on switching 
between superiority and non-inferiority (CPMP/EWP/482/99).

The incidence of the primary endpoint in the PP population was very similar for both treatment groups 
to that observed for the “efficacy evaluable population” (see Table **), the observed odds reduction (-
26.5%) is very similar to that of the primary analysis (-25.8%), and the 95%CI for the odds reduction 
in  the  PP  population  was  consistent  with  that  in  the  efficacy  evaluable  population,  supporting  the 
conclusion  of  non-inferiority  to  dalteparin.  The  results  of  the  PP  analysis  demonstrate  that 
fondaparinux  preserves  at  least  90%  (absolute  effect  retained  124%  [95%CI:  90%,  159%])  of  the 
historical  LMWH/UFH  benefit  over  placebo  according  to  the  Hasselblad  method  (Hasselblad  and 
Kong, 2001). 
Below are the results using the CHMP-recommended endpoint for VTE assessment in non-inferiority 
studies.  This  analysis  is  extremely underpowered  as  the  number  of qualifying  events is dramatically 
reduced  when  asymptomatic  distal  DVT  (representing  the  majority  of  venographic  events)  is  not 
included in the composite endpoint, and the study was not designed to evaluate non-inferiority under 
this restrictive endpoint definition. In both populations the incidence of events was <1% with the 95% 
CI for the odds ratio for the difference between the treatments being extremely wide and and do not 
allow to conclude that non-inferiority is demonstrated with regard to this composite endpoint.

As  recommended  in  the  CHMP  PtC  document,  the  revised  endpoint  was  also  analysed  with  the 
inclusion of all deaths that occurred up to the qualifying VTE assessment. The inclusion of all deaths 
has the effect of increasing the event rate, with the 95%CI for the treatment effect becoming narrower. 
Based  on  this  endpoint  the  odds  reduction  and  the  95%  CI  are  consistent  with  that  seen  for  the 
protocol specified primary endpoint, with a trend favouring fondaparinux.

Bleedings 
Most MBs occurred at the surgical site. During the treatment period the rate of MB was higher, though 
not  statistically  significant,  in  the  fondaparinux  group  compared  with  dalteparin  :  3.4%  [95  %CI 
2.5;4.5]vs 2.4% [95 % CI  1.7;3.3]. During the whole study  period, the rate of MB was statistically 
significant higher in the fondaparinux group compared with dalteparin : 4.3% [95 % CI 3.3 ; 5.4] vs 
2.7% [95 % CI  2.0.;3.7], absolute difference 1.5 [95 % CI 0.2 ; 2.9] p=0.032. During the treatment 
period, there were 2 fatal bleeds in each treatment group; during the follow-up period, no fatal bleeds 
occurred in the fondaparinux group, whereas 4 fatal bleeds were recorded in the dalteparin group (3 
not related and 1 possibly related according to the investigators). No bleeding into a critical organ was 
recorded in either treatment group during the complete study time.

There was no significant heterogeneity between treatment groups across subcategories of the various 
covariates  considered,  although  there  was  a  general  tendency  to  increased  bleeding  risk  in  patients 
with  impaired  renal  function,  and  also  with  increasing  age  (data  not  shown),  as  noted  earlier  in  the 
MOSLL studies. This probably reflects a combination of the well-known generally increased bleeding 
risk in these patients and an increased exposure (both drugs are dependent on renal function for their 
elimination).  No  significant increase  in  the  percentage  of patients  experiencing  major  bleedings was 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed in cancer surgery patients. The observed increased bleeding incidence in patients undergoing 
surgery under general anaesthesia probably reflects a selection of patients with increased bleeding risk.

Fatal  bleedings  or  bleedings  into  critical  sites  were  not  more  common  in  the  fondaparinux  group, 
which provides some reassurance regarding the safety of fondaparinux in this setting. 
The number of transfused patients (whole blood or packed red blood cells) was similar between the 2 
treatment  groups.  There  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  2  groups  in  the  percentage  of 
patients with Hb <8 g/dl and/or a decrease in Hb ≥2 g/dl during the treatment period. 
Adverse Events 
Despite a slight, non-significant, trend for an increased AE incidence in the fondaparinux group, the 
number  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  AE,  SAE  or  AE  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation 
were similar between the 2 treatment groups during the treatment period and the whole study period. 
An opposite trend for overall mortality was also noted.

The  slightly  higher  incidence  of  AEs  within  the  platelet,  bleeding  &  clotting  disorders  in  the 
fondaparinux  group  was  mainly  due  to  the  increased  bleeding  rate.  The  slightly  higher  incidence  in 
respiratory system disorders in the fondaparinux group was largely due to a higher number of patients 
with pneumonia, which may be a chance finding.

The  numerically  lower  number  of  deaths  not  associated  with  VTE  or  bleeding  in  the  fondaparinux 
group may have been a chance finding. However, due to the low event rate and the few observations, 
no firm conclusions can be drawn from these data. 
Regarding laboratory findings, no  difference  was observed between  the fondaparinux  group  and the 
active control group with regard to platelet counts in both PEGASUS and the pooled MOSLL studies, 
nor  were  notable  differences  observed  between  results  from  PEGASUS  and  the  pooled  MOSLL 
studies.  Assessment  of  antiplatelet  antibodies  was  mandatory  only  in  the  case  of  thrombocytopenia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No cases of HIT were observed. No vital signs, physical examination or electrocardiogram data were 
specifically collected. 
Safety in special populations 
As discussed previously, increased age and/or decreased Clcr appeared to increase the risk of bleeding.  
Discussion  
Efficacy 
The PEGASUS study, pivotal to this application, has demonstrated that fondaparinux 2.5 mg is non-
inferior but not superior to dalteparin with regard to total VTE detected by venographic surveillance ; 
there was a trend for a possible superior efficacy, but the difference was not significant.. However, the 
numerically reduced incidence of total VTE in the fondaparinux group is almost exclusively due to a 
reduction  of  asymptomatic  distal  thrombi,  which  probably  reflects  in  part  the  relatively  high 
proportion of this component of the composite end-point. The rate of proximal DVT and symptomatic 
VTE  was  very  low.  The  difference  observed  for  the  primary  endpoint  is  not  accompanied  by  any 
reduction in the more clinically relevant parameters of proximal DVT or symptomatic VTE, and this 
has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC.  
As detailed earlier in this report, PEGASUS was initially designed as a superiority trial vs. dalteparin, 
and  hence  the  choice  of  primary  endpoint  (i.e.  total  VTE  including  venographically  detected 
asymptomatic  distal  DVTs).  Due  to  the  low  VTE  event  rate,  and  prior  to  unblinding,  the  study 
hypothesis from changed to a “non-inferiority study”. Regarding this switch to “non-inferiority”, the 
CHMP  noted  a  number  of  shortcomings  with  respect  to  the  trial  design.  The  pre-specified  non-
inferiority margin chosen by the company is highly questionable (70%) as it can hardly be accepted 
from  a  clinical  perspective.  Nonetheless,  the  upper  limit  of  the  CI  of  the  ORR  is  well  below  the 
predefined  non-inferiority  margin,  substantiating  the  conclusion  that  fondaparinux  is  clinically  non-
inferior to dalteparin for the chosen primary end-point. Support for this conclusion is also gained from 
the previously evaluated extensive development programme in MOSLL.  
Secondly, for non-inferiority studies in this therapeutic area the CHMP recommends a composite end-
point  of  proximal  DVT  and/or  symptomatic  VTE  (“Points  to  Consider  on  clinical  investigation  of 
medicinal  products  for  prophylaxis  of  intra-  and  post-  operative  venous  thromboembolic  risk”).  A 
post-hoc  analysis  on  this  recommended  composite  endpoint  (excluding  distal  DVT)  shows  very  low 
event rates with extremely wide CIs in both groups, effectively precluding the demonstration of non-
inferiority  with  regard  to  dalteparin  for  this  revised  endpoint.  The  MAH  argues,  and  the  CHMP 
essentially  agrees,  that  the  use  of  the  more  clinically  relevant  endpoint  of  proximal  DVT  and/or 
symptomatic VTE in a setting with such low event rates would require a very large study population 
and  such  a  study  would  probably  not  be  feasible.  Thus,  it  remains  difficult  to  estimate  the  size  of 
clinically  relevant  differences  from  possible  differences  in  the  chosen  primary  end-point  as  it  is 
dominated by asymptomatic events. Nevertheless, the different sensitivity analyses performed and the 
analyses  on  the  per  protocol  (PP)  populations,  considered  to  be  the  more  conservative  approach  for 
non-inferiority  analyses  and  in  line  with  CHMP  guidance,  provide  support  for  the  robustness  of  the 
primary  efficacy  analysis.  Indeed,  the  results  for  the  pre-specified  primary  endpoint  as  well  as  for 
symptomatic  VTE  and  symptomatic  VTE/all  deaths  at  Day  32  for  the  PP  population,  provide 
reassurance that the trend favouring fondaparinux and the conclusion of non-inferiority to dalteparin 
based  on  the  primary  endpoint  is  maintained.  Furthermore,  in  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  trial 
results in the large subpopulation (69%) undergoing cancer surgery a statistically significant reduction 
of total VTE rates was noted in the fondaparinux group, as mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC. 
The  MAH  has  proposed  a  broad  indication;  however,  PEGASUS  targeted  patients  with  high  risk  of 
VTE, quite similar to the “high risk” definition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 
consensus  of  2004.  Moreover,  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  undergoing  cancer  surgery,  who  are  at  a 
higher  risk  of  thromboembolic  complications,  fondaparinux  was  superior  to  dalteparin,  providing  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  of  the  primary  composite  endpoint.  Consequently,  the  CHMP  has 
restricted  the  therapeutic  indication  to  the  use  in  patients  who  are  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of 
thromboembolic  complications,  such  as  patients  undergoing  abdominal  cancer  surgery.  Lastly, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients  undergoing  urological  (except  kidney)  or  gynecological  surgery,  laparoscopic  surgery  and 
vascular were excluded from the study. This has been reflected in section 5.1. 
Finally, the 1.5 mg dose was regrettably not tested in the PEGASUS trial. While the CHMP consider 
this  regrettable,  the  company  proposes,  and  the  CHMP  agrees,  that  the  dosing  recommendations  for 
renally impaired patients in the setting  of  abdominal surgery at high  risk  of  VTE should remain the 
same as are currently recommended for MOSLL and medical patients, pending the assessment of an 
overview of the clinical experience with regard to efficacy and bleeding incidence in renally impaired 
patients specifically requested by CHMP as a Follow up Measure. 
Safety 
There were more major bleedings on fondaparinux than on dalteparin during the treatment period. The 
difference  in  major  bleedings  became  statistically  significant  during  the  whole  study  period.  The 
bleedings  observed  after  the  acute  treatment  phase  may  very  well  be  due  to  delayed  clinical 
manifestation  of  bleedings  that  have  started  during  or  shortly  after  treatment.  There  is  also  a 
numerically  increased  incidence  of  minor  bleedings  in  the  fondaparinux  group  during  the  treatment 
period and the whole study period. As expected, most major bleedings occurred at the surgical site and 
were associated with a tendency to an increased need of re-surgery. In this respect, the MAH suggests 
that the clinical relevance of such bleedings may be considered minor, but such major bleedings, e.g. 
when  occurring  in  patients  with  ischaemic  areas  in  the  heart  or  brain,  or  when  necessitating  blood 
transfusions and/o reoperation, cannot be considered to be of minor importance. Similar observations 
of  an  increased  bleeding  tendency  were  noted  in  the  MOSSL  prevention  studies,  where  the  same 
fondaparinux  regimen  was  compared  with  enoxaparin.  Reassuringly,  in  PEGASUS  there  was  no 
evidence  to  suggest  any  difference  for  the  clinically  relevant  endpoints  of  fatal  bleeds,  bleeds  into 
critical organs, or the number of transfusions, and the incidence of major bleeding was comparable to 
that  in  the  pre-operative  randomisation  MOSLL  studies.  The  patient  subgroups  who  are  at  an 
increased risk of bleeding are well characterised (patients with some degree of renal dysfunction and 
the elderly) , were similar in PEGASUS and the MOSLL studies and are adequately described in the 
SPC. 
No other safety concerns are identified in the PEGASUS study. A slight, non-significant, trend for an 
increased  AE  incidence  in  the  fondaparinux  group  was  observed,  but  an  opposite  trend  for  overall 
mortality is also noted. 
Conclusions and Benefit/ Risk Assessment 
The  conclusion  from  the  PEGASUS  trial  with  regard  to  anti-thrombotic  efficacy,  taking  also  the 
overall  experience  with  fondaparinux  into  account  (i.e.  studies  in  MOSLL  and  medical  patients),  is 
that  fondaparinux  is  essentially  as  least  as  effective  as  the  dalteparin  regimen  in  the  prevention  of 
surveillance  VTE.  The  significantly  lower  VTE  rates  among  the  fondaparinux-treated  patients  that 
underwent  cancer  surgery  as  compared  to  the  dalteparin  patients  support  the  conclusion  that 
fondaparinux 2.5 mg may be somewhat more effective than 5000 IU dalteparin in patient undergoing 
abdominal  cancer  surgery.  Such  a  difference,  if  real,  can  be  expected  to  be  more  easily  detected  in 
patients with an increased VTE risk and cancer surgery patients constitutes such a major risk group. 
Not unexpectedly, the tendency for increased efficacy is accompanied by a clear trend for increased 
major bleeding rates, but the rate of fatal bleedings or bleedings into critical sites was not increased as 
compared  with  dalteparin.  Indeed,  the  rather  extensive  overall  experience  from  prophylaxis  with 
fondaparinux in high risk patients (undergoing MOSLL, abdominal surgery or being immobilised due 
to medical illness) indicates that the risk for fatal bleedings or bleedings into critical sites may not be 
more common than during prophylaxis with the approved alternatives or, alternatively, if an increased 
risk exists, it appears to be so small that it is difficult to detect also in clinical studies of considerable 
size  (cf.  the  results  from  the  MOSLL  programme).  However,  as  the  preliminary  results  from  the 
APOLLO trial (not included and not discussed in this report ) may indicate, where an increase in the 
incidence  of  haemorrhagic  deaths  approaching  0.5%  as  compared  to  placebo  was  observed, 
prophylaxis with Arixtra in low risk patients could be associated with a negative benefit/risk balance. 
Indeed, when using a drug in prophylaxis in abdominal surgery, the treating physician should assess 
the baseline risk of VTE event and the benefit/risk ratio in terms of reduction of clinically significant 
VTE events versus safety concerns in terms of clinically significant bleedings. Bearing this in mind, 
 
 
 
 
 
the  CHMP  has  restricted  the  therapeutic  indication  to  the  use  in  patients  undergoing  abdominal 
surgery  who  are  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of  thromboembolic  complications,  such  as  patients 
undergoing abdominal cancer surgery.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN         
Summary of risk management plan for Byooviz (ranibizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Byooviz. The RMP details important 
risks of Byooviz, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Byooviz’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Byooviz’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Byooviz should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Byooviz should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Byooviz’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Byooviz is authorized in adults for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
(PDR, visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch 
RVO or central RVO), and visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). It 
contains ranibizumab as the active substance. Byooviz is a solution for injection and must be 
administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  ranibizumab’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
ranibizumab’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/byooviz 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks   
Important risks of Byooviz, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Byooviz’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  Byooviz,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition to these measures, information  about  adverse reactions is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Byooviz is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Byooviz  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Byooviz. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risks 
Infectious endophthalmitis 
Intraocular inflammation 
Retinal detachment and retinal tear 
Intraocular pressure increase 
II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Infectious endophthalmitis 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence has been derived from information on the 
reference product (RMP summary and SmPC; information 
in the public domain) and the conducted Byooviz Phase III 
study. 
Risk factors and risk groups  To minimize the occurrence of endophthalmitis guidance is 
provided in SmPC on how to administer an intravitreal 
injection and to inform and educate physicians and patients 
on prevention and management of this event. 
Byooviz is contraindicated in patients with active or 
suspected ocular or periocular infections or in patients with 
active severe intraocular inflammation.

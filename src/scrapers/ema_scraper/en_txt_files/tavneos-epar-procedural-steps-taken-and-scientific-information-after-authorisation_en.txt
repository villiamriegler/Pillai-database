are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Higher non-study supplied prednisone-equivalent levels 
correct a recently identified calculation error that 
occurred in the conversion of various non-
prednisolone glucocorticoids to their prednisolone-
equivalent doses in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 
CL010_168 (ADVOCATE). Furthermore minor 
revisions were made to section 4.4. (deletion of the 
term “viral” from the warning on live viral vaccines to 
have also not viral vaccines  within the scope of the 
warning), and revised white blood cell count units (L 
instead of µL)). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
were observed in both treatment arms of study 
CL010_168. The difference in total cumulative 
glucocorticoid use between the arms was smaller in the 
presented data (3846.9 mg in the comparator group vs 
1675.5 mg in the avacopan group, 2.3-fold higher in the 
comparator group) than compared to the data presented in 
the original application (3654.5 mg in the comparator 
group vs 1348.9 mg in the avacopan group, 2.7-fold higher 
in the comparator group). Although this indicates that the 
glucocorticoid-sparing effect of avacopan is not as large as 
previously indicated, it is still considered to be clinically 
relevant.

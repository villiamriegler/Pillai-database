2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem with an estimated 170 million 
individuals infected worldwide. HCV infection is a major European public health challenge, with a 
prevalence of 0.4-3.5% in different EU member states. It is the most common single cause of liver 
transplantation in the Union. HCV is divided into six major genotypes and numerous subtypes, which are 
based on phylogenetic relationship. Genotype 1 is the most common genotype in Europe, comprising 
approximately 70 % of infections. Genotype 3 is second most common, followed by genotype 2. Genotype 
4 is predominant in Egypt, the nation in the world with the highest documented HCV prevalence. 
Genotypes 5 and -6 are uncommon in Europe and the US, but are more common in South Africa and 
South-East Asia, respectively (Simmonds et al, Hepatology 2005). HCV genotype does not clearly impact 
the rate of disease progression. Treatment response, or the required drug pressure (number of drugs, 
treatment duration) needed to obtain maximal activity with presently approved regimens, differs 
between genotypes. 
The goal of antiviral therapy against HCV is to reach sustained virological response (SVR), which has 
traditionally been defined as the absence of quantifiable virus in plasma at least 24 weeks after the end 
of therapy (SVR24). However, most relapses occur within 4 weeks of treatment discontinuation, and a 
98-99% concordance has been shown between absence of quantifiable virus 12 weeks after therapy, and 
SVR24 (Florian et al, AASLD 2011). Therefore the absence of measurable virus 12 weeks post end of 
treatment (SVR12) is presently considered accepted by European and US regulators as the primary 
endpoint in clinical trials. Though occasional late relapses occur, in general the durability of SVR has been 
demonstrated (e.g., Ng and Saab, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011). Of note, SVR4 (absence of 
quantifiable virus 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation) has an approximately 90% positive predictive 
value for SVR24 (Florian et al, AASLD 2011). 
Until the European Commission marketing authorisation of sofosbuvir in January 2014, all approved 
therapeutic regimens for the treatment of chronic HCV infection contained an interferon. For the 
treatment of genotype 1 infection, the addition of either one of the NS3/4A protease inhibitors telaprevir 
or boceprevir, authorised in 2011, was considered standard of care. For genotypes other than GT-1, there 
were no direct-acting antivirals (DAA) authorised, therefore dual therapy with pegIFN/RBV was the 
standard of care. 
Interferon-based therapies have limited efficacy in many patients and are associated with potentially 
serious side effects that are important in limiting real life effectiveness. These include a risk of hepatic 
decompensation and septicaemia in patients with advanced liver disease, as well as bone marrow 
suppression. Also, there are psychiatric side effects such as depression, which considerably limits 
eligibility to treatment in the target population (e.g., Bini et al, Am J Gastroenterol 2005). 
For these reasons, the development of highly effective interferon-free regimens for the treatment of 
hepatitis C targets addresses an important previously unmet medical need.  
SOF/LDV is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing sofosbuvir (a previously approved NS5B 
polymerase inhibitor) and ledipasvir, a new NS5A-inhibitor. HCV NS5A is a multifunctional protein with 
key functions in HCV replication, virus assembly, and the modulation of cellular signaling pathways (e.g., 
Sheel and Rice, Nature Medicine, 2013). 
The  FDC tablet contains 400 mg of SOF and 90 mg of LDV. SOF/LDV has the potential to be a simple and 
effective all-oral, once-daily treatment regimen for chronic HCV infection.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The finished product is a fixed dose combination of two active substances: ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. 
Ledipasvir has never previously been assessed or marketed in the EU. Sofosbuvir, however, is the active 
ingredient of the already-authorised product Sovaldi. Information on its quality is essentially the same as 
in the Sovaldi dossier. 
Ledipasvir 
General information 
The chemical name of ledipasvir acetone solvate (LDV-AS) is methyl 
[(2S)-1-{(6S)-6-[5-(9,9-difluoro-7-{2-[(1R,3S,4S)-2-{(2S)-2-[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-methylbut
anoyl}-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-3-yl]-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl}-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5-aza
spiro[2.4]hept-5-yl}-3-methyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl]carbamate propan-2-one (1:1), also known as carbamic 
acid, 
N-[(1S)-1-[[(6S)-6-[5-[9,9-difluoro-7-[2-[(1R,3S,4S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-methyl-
1-oxobutyl]-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-3-yl]-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl]-9H-fluoren-2-yl]-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5
-azaspiro[2.4]hept-5-yl]carbonyl]-2-methylpropyl]-, methyl ester, compd. with 2-propanone (1:1) or 
methyl {(1S)-1-[(1R,3S,4S)-3-{5-[9,9-difluoro-7-(2-{(6S)-5-[N- (methoxycarbonyl)- 
l-valyl]-5-azaspiro[2.4]hept-6-yl}-1Himidazol-4-yl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl]-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl}-2-azabicyc
lo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carbonyl]-2-ethylpropyl}carbamate, compound with 2-propanone (1:1) and it has 
the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 8/80 
  
  
 
The structure of ledipasvir was unambiguously confirmed by 1H, 13C and 19F NMR spectroscopy, UV 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X-ray 
crystallography. 
LDV-AS is a white to tinted (off-white, tan, yellow, orange, or pink), slightly hygroscopic crystalline solid. 
It shows pH dependent solubility in aqueous media: it is slightly soluble in pH 2.3 buffer but practically 
insoluble in pH 4-7.5 buffers. It is freely soluble in ethanol and DMSO and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Ledipasvir is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres and enantiomeric purity is controlled in starting 
material specifications. Three crystalline forms are known and ledipasvir acetone solvate is the 
designated commercial form. The first step for finished product manufacture involves the dissolution of 
ledipasvir in ethanol followed by spray-drying and thus precise control of morphology and particle size is 
not considered important. 
Ledipasvir is a chemical substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European 
Union. Furthermore, it is not a salt, complex, derivative or isomer, (nor mixture of isomers), of a 
previously authorised substance. Whilst it contains some structural features in common with daclastavir, 
it is metabolically stable and the applicant presented data indicating that there are no common active 
metabolites. Therefore, the therapeutic moieties are not the same. Ledipasvir thus meets the definition of 
a New Active Substance according to the Notice to Applicants (NtA), Vol 2A, Chapter 1, Annex 3. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ledipasvir is synthesized by multiple manufacturers in five main steps using four well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Manufacturing process design and process controls ensure the 
consistent quality of ledipasvir AS.  
The applicant's original proposal for starting material definition was rejected by the CHMP. The applicant 
agreed to re-define as requested and was able to do this for two materials before CHMP opinion. 
Re-definition of a further starting material and implementation of  GMP standards for additional steps of 
the synthetic process will be completed by May 2015. The CHMP agreed to this proposal as no immediate 
concerns with regard to the quality of the active substance have arisen in relation with the above for these 
steps. Nevertheless, the re-definition of the starting materials is considered essential in ensuring the 
continued quality of the active substance throughout the product life-cycle. Adherence to GMP and the 
associated controls of manufacturing steps will help to prevent a drift in the impurity pattern. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
Active substance critical quality attributes were identified based on their ability to impact finished product 
performance. The proposed control strategy includes raw material specifications, manufacture under 
GMP, in-process controls and release testing. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered acceptable. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (UV, HPLC, 
GC (for acetone)), assay (HPLC), acetone content (GC), impurities (HPLC), elemental impurities 
(ICP-MS), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF) and clarity of solution (in-house method). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 9/80 
  
  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data for 20 batches of the active substance are provided. The batches were manufactured 
on pilot and commercial scale and were used for clinical trials, stability and toxicology studies and process 
validation. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on eight batches of LDV-AS manufactured using the proposed commercial process stored in 
the intended commercial packaging for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Stability was also tested under stressed conditions. One commercial scale batch was stored at 
50, 5 and -20 ºC for up to 4 weeks. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed 
on one commercial scale batch. LDV-AS was also exposed to high temperature in the solid state (100 ºC), 
and in solution (50 ºC). Samples were also exposed to acidic (1.2 M HCl, 60 ºC), basic (1.2 M NH4OH, 60 
ºC) and oxidative (H2O2) forced degradation conditions. The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and water content (KF). The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters, other than a minor increase in water content, 
occurred on storage under long term, accelerated or stressed conditions. A large (up to 3.7%) increase in 
a highly coloured photo-degradation product was observed in the photostability study. Degradation also 
occurred under acidic, basic, and oxidative forced degradation conditions. As a result, the active 
substance is stored protected from light. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
The applicant will complete all on-going stability studies under long term conditions up to at least the 36 
month time point. In addition, stability studies will be carried out on the first 3 commercial batches of 
LDV-AS and at least one commercial batch per year. 
Sofosbuvir 
General information 
The chemical name of sofosbuvir is 
(S)-isopropyl-2-((S)-(((2R,3R,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)-4-fluoro-3-hydroxy
-4-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)-(phenoxy)phosphorylamino)propanoate and it has the 
following structure: 
The structure of Sofosbuvir was unambiguously confirmed by 1H, 13C, 31P and 19F NMR, UV spectroscopy, 
IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 10/80 
  
  
 
Sofosbuvir is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, slightly soluble in water (pH 1.2-7.7), 
freely soluble in ethanol and acetone, soluble in 2-propanol, and insoluble in heptane. 
Sofosbuvir is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres which are well controlled by the synthetic process 
and the specifications of raw materials. The absolute and relative configuration of these chiral centres was 
established by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Eight polymorphic forms of Sofosbuvir have been 
observed and the manufacturing process consistently produces Sofosbuvir as the most 
thermodynamically stable polymorphic form, containing a small amount of a metastable form which were 
determined to be pharmaceutically equivalent as per ICH Q6A (decision tree #4). Other polymorphic 
forms are excluded by the manufacturing process and their absence is confirmed by DSC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sofosbuvir is synthesized in six synthetic steps using three well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. Sofosbuvir possesses six stereocentres and its manufacture under GMP occurs at multiple 
manufacturers. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to 
ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set 
based on the manufacturing experience to date. It is recommended that the applicant considers 
tightening the impurity limits when sufficient commercial scale experience has been gained to fully assess 
the capability of the manufacturing process.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution, 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents and volatile organic impurities (GC), metals (ICP), 
particle size (Ph. Eur.), and polymorphic form (DSC – Ph. Eur.). Rationale for the absence of tests for 
water content (non-hygroscopic) and microbiological testing (low water content and water activity, 
isolation from organic solvent) was considered justified. Residue on ignition testing is not suitable as the 
active substance contains phosphorous: this test is replaced with a combination of clarity of solution test 
and ICP for elemental impurities. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on 33 batches of the active substance ranging from laboratory through pilot to 
commercial scale, and used for development, stability, toxicology, clinical studies, and validation were 
provided. Assessment focussed primarily on later pilot commercial scale batches used for development, 
stability and validation. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 8 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers, as well as the 
applicant itself, in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market, for up to 12 
months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing 
following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Stressed studies were carried out on a single 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 11/80 
  
  
batch between -20 and 50 ºC for up to 4 weeks. Forced degradation was carried out under acidic (0.1 M 
HCl), alkaline (10 mM Na2CO3) and oxidative (3% H2O2) conditions and at 105 ºC. 
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurity content, water content, and polymorphic form. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for water content, measured by GVS, 
and were stability indicating. 
Sofosbuvir was shown to be stable under long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions and is not 
sensitive to light. Forced degradation revealed that the active substance may degrade via oxidation or 
hydrolysis in solution, but remains stable in the solid state even up to 105 ºC after 1 week. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed 24 months retest period in the proposed 
container. 
The applicant will complete all on-going stability studies under long term conditions up to the 60 month 
time point. In addition, stability studies will be carried out on the first 3 commercial batches of sofosbuvir. 
Furthermore, at least 1 commercial batch from each proposed manufacturer per year will be placed on a 
long-term stability study. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop an immediate release orally available formulation containing a fixed dose 
combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, stable over the shelf-life of the product, and with reliable 
bioavailability characteristics. 
Ledipasvir exhibits low, but pH-dependent, solubility and high apparent permeability (BCS class II). It is 
susceptible to the influence of gastrointestinal pH and fed state and so an amorphous spray-dried 
dispersion of LDV (LDV-SDD) was developed in order to mitigate these food effects. LDV-SDD is an 
amorphous solid powder. It is hygroscopic and photosensitive, but physically and chemically stable for up 
to 6 months if protected from light and moisture in a sealed container. The physicochemical properties of 
LDV-SDD are amenable to formulation in a solid oral tablet. 
By contrast, sofosbuvir is highly soluble but has low apparent intestinal permeability (BCS class III). It 
exhibits pH-independent solubility across a pH range from 1.2-7.7. Sofosbuvir is a crystalline solid, 
routinely manufactured as the most stable polymorphic form containing small quanitites of an equivalent 
polymorphic form. It is neither hygroscopic nor photosensitive and is stable to oxidation and hydrolytic 
degradation at neutral pH. Sofosbuvir particle size was found to be critical for dissolution rate, so the 
active substance is sieved or screen milled and particle size is controlled by specification. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Compatibility studies of both active substances with the chosen 
excipients, and with each other, demonstrated that both are stable in the proposed formulation. 
Phase I and II clinical trials were carried out with ledipasvir as a single agent. The phase I formulation 
used ledipasvir amorphous free base in film-coated tablets. The crystalline D-tartrate salt of ledipasvir 
was used for early phase II trials, and LDV-SDD introduced for later phase II trials to mitigate against food 
effects. An improvement in in vivo performance was demonstrated LDV-SDD as compared to the other 
ledipasvir forms. Phase III trials used film-coated tablets with a fixed-dose combination of both active 
substances. The combination tablet showed equivalent pharmacokinetic performance to co-administered

single agent tablets. The only other changes made during phase III trials involved tablet debossing and 
changing the colour of the film coating. 
A dissolution method was developed to distinguish between physiologically relevant properties of the 
active substances and was demonstrated to be discriminatory.  
The primary packaging is high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a polypropylene child-resistant 
closure, a silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EU regulation 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two separate parts. 
The LDV spray drying process process is controlled by set-points and normal operating ranges (NORs) 
during the process. The resultant LDV-AS is considered an intermediate and its quality is controlled by a 
specification with tests for appearance, appearance  (visual inspection), identification (HPLC, IR, NIR), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradants (HPLC), amorphous form (XRPD) and particle size 
(laser light scattering). 
The tablet manufacturing  process consists of 4 main steps: blending of LDV-SDD and sofosbuvir with 
intra-granular  excipients  followed  by  granulation;  blending  of  granules  with  extra-granular  excipients 
followed by compression to form tablet cores; film-coating; packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard  manufacturing  process.  In-process  controls  are  carried  out  for  critical  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process. 
The applicant will perform a formal validation of the manufacturing process with the first three 
commercial batches manufactured at each proposed manufacturing site prior to commercial distribution. 
A validation protocol has been provided and is considered acceptable, given the standard manufacturing 
process. The in-process controls are adequate for the production of film-coated tablets. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
comprise tests for appearance (visual inspection), identification (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
strength (HPLC), degradants (HPLC),  uniformity of  dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and dissolution (Ph. Eur.). 
Studies  showed  that  the  finished  product  tablets  exhibit  low  water  activity  indicating  unfavourable 
conditions for microbial growth. As stated in ICH Q6A, Decision Tree 8, the absence of microorganism 
growth at tablet release testing justify excluding routine microbiological limit testing for a non-sterile drug 
product. Nonetheless, a non-routine microbial examination test (Ph. Eur.) will be included in the product 
specification. 
Batch analysis results are provided for fourteen pilot to commercial scale batches from the two proposed 
manufacturers confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of eight production scale batches of finished product from the proposed manufacturers 
stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months, and under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 13/80 
  
  
packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance (visual inspection), water 
content (Ph. Eur.), strength (HPLC), degradants (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological 
contamination (Ph. Eur.). No relevant change or trend to any of the measured parameters was observed 
under the three storage conditions. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, stressed stability studies were carried out on one production scale batch. The finished product 
was exposed for 45 days to the following conditions: 5 ºC; 25 ºC / 80% RH; 25 ºC / 60% RH open 
container; 30 ºC / 75% RH open container; 50 ºC / ambient humidity. No significant trends were 
observed apart from an increase in water in the open container studies. However, this had no impact on 
any of the other tested parameters. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant trends were observed which demonstrates that the 
finished product tablets are not susceptible to photo-degradation. 
The applicant proposes that the date of manufacture of the finished product should be independent of the 
date of production of LDV-SDD for which 6 months of stability data are available. Two of the eight 
reported stability batches were manufactured using LDV-SDD stored for 6 months prior to finished 
product manufacture. This is considered acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
The applicant will complete all on-going stability studies under intermediate and long term conditions up 
to the 60 month time point. In addition, stability studies will be carried out on the first 3 commercial 
batches of finished product under long-term and accelerated conditions. Furthermore, at least 1 
commercial batch from each proposed manufacturer per year will be placed on a long-term stability 
study. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP notes that the applicant has agreed with the Committee’s recommendation to re-define starting 
materials and implement GMP for additional steps of the synthetic process by May 2015.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Sofosbuvir is a novel HCV nonstructural protein (NS)5B polymerase nucleotide inhibitor that 
demonstrates potent in vitro inhibition of HCV replicon ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication. 
Ledipasvir (methyl [(2S)-1-{(6S)-6-[5-(9,9-difluoro-7-{2-[(1R,3S,4S)-2-{(2S)-2- 
[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-methylbutanoyl}-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-3-yl]-1Hbenzimidazol- 
6-yl}-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5-azaspiro[2.4]hept-5-yl}-3-methyl- 
1-oxobutan-2-yl]carbamate) is a novel compound designed to inhibit HCV replication and virion 
production by targeting the HCV NS5A protein. 
The applicant provided a dossier in support of a marketing authorisation application for a fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) tablet of sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LDV) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) 
infection. 
Comprehensive programs of nonclinical studies with SOF and LDV as individual agents have been 
conducted; the nonclinical data are provided in m2.6 of this submission. To facilitate the evaluation of 
SOF, LDV, and the SOF/LDV FDC, nonclinical virology studies with the individual agents and SOF/LDV FDC 
were provided. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is a prodrug of 2’-deoxy-2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyluridine monophosphate that is phosphorylated 
intracellularly to the active triphosphate form (GS-461203). The nucleoside triphosphate is a non-obligate 
chain-terminating analog of UTP that competes for incorporation at the HCV NS5B polymerase active site. 
Viral RNA synthesis is inhibited secondary to incorporation of the phosphorylated metabolite into nascent 
viral RNA by the HCV dependent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in pangenotypic activity. In 
biochemical assays direct inhibition of NS5B polymerase was shown and characterised by IC50 values 
ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 μM. 
Sofosbuvir and the diasteromeric mixture GS-9851 appeared to have a low potential for mitochondrial 
toxicity in cell based assays as determined by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion or 
selective cytochrome c oxidase protein depletion. The triphosphate metabolite had no significant 
inhibitory activity on human DNA polymerases α, β, and γ or RNA polymerase II as reflected in IC50>200 
μM. 
In studies to determine potential for off target activity of GS-9851 no inhibition or induction greater than 
50% at 10 μM was recorded in a panel of 171 receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, including cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes. These test systems used various cell types, platelets and tissue systems and 
incubation times ranging from 10 min to hours. Furthermore, the major metabolite GS-331007 at 
concentrations of 10 µM had no significant (defined as ≥50% inhibition or stimulation) effect on a panel 
of receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. The data are consistent with GS-331007 having a limited 
potential for secondary pharmacological effects. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-9851 had no significant activity (EC50>100 µM) against other viruses such as HIV-1 
and HBV. At 100 µM GS-9851 showed an 18% inhibition of HBV. 
Single oral doses of GS-9851 up to 1000 mg/kg in rat and dog had no major effects on parameters 
monitored to determine potential for interference with the central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular

systems. In vitro, no significant inhibition of hERG current by GS-9851, GS-566500, GS-606965 and 
GS-331007 was reported at the highest concentrations used (100-300 µM). 
From the non-clinical point of view the data has overall provided adequate characterisation of the 
pharmacology of sofosbuvir and its major metabolites.  
Ledipasvir  
The mode of action of ledipasvir has not been directly established but indirect evidence is consistent with 
the compound targeting the NS5A molecule. In vitro resistance selection and cross-resistance studies, 
and the lack of HCV enzyme or kinase inhibition was taken to support the conclusion that ledipasvir 
targets NS5A as its mode of action. Ledipasvir has shown antiviral activity against HCV genotypes 1a and 
1b with mean EC50 values of 0.031 and 0.004 nM, respectively. Antiviral activity determined as EC50 
against genotypes 2 to 6 ranged from 0.15 to 530 nM. 
Ledipasvir showed no relevant antiviral activity at the highest concentration tested, or the highest 
concentration without cytotoxicity, against other virus such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), RSV, 
HBV, HIV-1, HRV, influenza A and B, and a panel of flaviviruses (including West Nile virus, yellow fever 
virus, dengue virus, and banzai virus). 
Cytotoxicity of ledipasvir was characterised by CC50 of 4029 to >50000 nM using different cell lines 
(1b-Rluc-2, Huh-luc, 1a-HRlucp, Hep G2, SL3, Huh7, Hep-2, AD-38 and MT4 cells). 
Ledipasvir at 10 µM showed significant binding to 3 ion channels and 1 receptor in a radioligand binding 
assay screen against a panel of 68 mammalian ion channels and receptors. The IC50s of ledipasvir were 
0.210 and 3.47 μM against sodium channel site 2 and calcium channel L-type (dihydropyridine), 
respectively. A 50% inhibition of androgen receptor was noted at 10 μM.  Ledipasvir activity against 442 
kinases was assessed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based competition assay. 
Results showed weak competition for binding of 2 kinases, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and 
homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) at 0.1 and 1 μM, respectively. Taking into account the 
high protein binding, >99.5%, of ledipasvir the large margin between unbound maximum clinical plasma 
levels (0.8 nM) and potential ion channel/receptor inhibition indicates limited clinical relevance. 
In safety pharmacology studies ledipasvir was investigated at doses up to 100 mg/kg in rat and 30 mg/kg 
in dog corresponding to systemic exposures and Cmax levels approximately x3 and x9-10, respectively, 
the expected clinical values. In the rat central nervous system study occasional occurrences of low 
locomotor activity was observed in one or more groups, including control, but due to the overall low 
incidence and the lack of dose-related pattern, a relationship to treatment seemed unlikely. No significant 
findings were noted for other open-field observations. No statistically significant findings were noted for 
forelimb grip strength, hindlimb grip strength, nociceptive reflex, or body temperature in animals given 
10, 30, or 100 mg/kg.  
In the rat respiratory study animals given 10 or 30 mg/kg displayed statistically significant overall 
increases in covariate-adjusted mean minute volume compared with controls across the measured 
timepoints. The low magnitude of the effect and lack of statistically significant effect at 100 mg/kg 
suggested that the response was incidental and not related to treatment with the test article. 
Occasional intermittent and statistically significant effects were observed in the dog cardiovascular study, 
but as no dose-response was evident and the changes were minor, these were likely biologically 
unimportant. Ledipasvir had no effect on the qualitative or quantitative ECG data. The data overall 
suggest lack of any relevant cardiovascular toxicity of ledipasvir. 
The IC50 was >0.50 µM, the highest dose tested, in the in vitro hERG study. The dose was based on the 
limit of solubility in the hERG vehicle (HB-PS+0.3% DMSO). Considering the maximum clinical unbound 
level a sufficiently high concentration was tested.

Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
In vitro studies of the combination sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were performed in genotype 1b, 2a, 3a, and 
4a replicon cell lines. No significant change in cell viability was reported at sofosbuvir concentrations of 
320 nM in combination with ledipasvir ranging from 0.014 nM to 1760 nM. No other studies with the 
combination are available. 
The primary pharmacology of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been sufficiently described from the non-clinical 
point of view. Considering data from secondary pharmacology screening and safety pharmacology studies 
that addressed potential for unwanted effects with respect to the respiratory, cardiovascular and central 
nervous systems there were no evident or clinically relevant indications of untoward effects of the 
compounds alone also suggesting that the combination would not produce any significant synergistic 
changes. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The disposition of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir has been investigated in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. 
Pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic data to support toxicology studies are available and considered in the 
sections below. 
Sofosbuvir  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of sofosbuvir were determined in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. The oral 
bioavailability following administration to portal vein cannulated dogs was determined to approximately 
10% while in pentagastrin treated dogs bioavailability was reported to 18.7%. The hepatic extraction 
ratio was estimated to 74%. In vitro sofosbuvir was found to have a partially saturable efflux and low 
forward permeability as assessed in Caco-2 cell monolayers.  
The stability of sofosbuvir (S-diasteromer at phosphorous), GS-9851 (isomeric mixture at phosphorous 
containing sofosbuvir, the S-diastereomer and GS-491241, the R-diastereomer) was investigated in 
vitro. The compounds were found to be stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. GS-9851 was 
degraded rapidly in blood of mouse and rat, but was stable in non-rodent blood. Additional studies 
showed that sofosbuvir and GS-9851 were unstable in mouse and rat plasma due to esterase activity. 
Sofosbuvir, its diastereomer and the isomeric mixture GS-9851 were stable in human plasma.  
Protein binding was low both for sofosbuvir and its major metabolite GS-331007 in dog and human. Due 
to instability protein binding for sofosbuvir could not be determined in mouse, rat and rabbit plasma, but 
protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. 
Tissue distribution was studied using whole body quantitative autoradiography and data indicated a 
similar pattern of distribution in albino and pigmented animals with levels generally higher in tissues of 
albino animals at 1 hour post dose, but lower than in pigmented animals at 24 hours. After single oral 
doses of 20 mg/kg in partially pigmented rats highest levels of radiolabel were generally determined at 4 
to 6 hours post-dose. Tissues with highest radioactivity included liver, alimentary canal, renal cortex, 
lymph node, spleen, thymus, bone marrow and lung. Levels in brain were low, but quantifiable up to 24 
hours. There was no specific association of radioactive material with melanin. Studies in pregnant rats 
showed that sofosbuvir crossed the placenta. Foetal blood and brain sofosbuvir derived radioactivity was 
higher than in dams, but foetal liver and kidney had lower levels than corresponding organs in dams. 
Sofosbuvir derived radioactivity was also quantifiable in milk from day 2 postpartum rats, but nursing 
pups did not appear to be extensively exposed to drug-derived radioactivity. Milk to plasma ratios were 
0.1 at 1 hour and 0.8 at 24 hours. 
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that sofosbuvir was an efficient substrate for 
Cathepsin A (Cat A) and carboxyesterase 1 (CES1). There were no indications of metabolism via UGTs or 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 17/80 
  
  
flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). Sofosbuvir was cleaved by CatA and CES1 and subsequent 
activation steps included amino acid removal by HINT1 and phosphorylation by UMP-CMP kinase and NDP 
kinase. In vitro data indicated that Cat A preferentially hydrolysed sofosbuvir the S-diastereomer while 
CES 1 did not exhibit stereoselectivity. This would be consistent with studies using GS-9851 showing a 
less efficient metabolism to the triphosphate in the hepatically derived cell line containing the Clone A 
replicon and shown to exhibit low CES 1 activity, but high Cat A activity compared with primary human 
hepatocytes.  Following incubation of hepatocytes from rat, dog, monkey and human GS-9851 was 
converted to the triphosphate GS-461203 in all species, most efficiently in human. Sofosbuvir was also 
readily converted to the triphosphate in dog liver after oral doses and was the dominant metabolite at all 
time-points assessed with a long half-life of approx. 18 hours. The active metabolite GS-461203 could not 
be detected in monkey. Further while GS-461203 was detected in rat liver, it could not be measured in 
liver from mouse. 
Isomeric conversion was not evident in rat, dog and human plasma and human urine. 
After single oral doses in mouse and rat GS-9851 was not detected in plasma, but the nucleoside 
metabolite GS-331007 could be determined in plasma and liver. Overall no marked differences in 
pharmacokinetics between male and female animals were evident and no accumulation appeared to take 
place after repeated doses. 
In male mouse given a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir, two metabolites GS-331007 and 
GS-566500, were found in plasma, accounting for 86.5% and 13.5%, respectively, of total plasma 
radioactivity. These two metabolites were also detected in urine with GS-331007, accounting for 55.2% 
of radioactivity in 0-168 hours. In mouse feces, only, GS-331007 was observed and amounted to 14.1% 
of total radioactivity in 0-168 hours. 
In rats given a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir, the major metabolite in plasma was GS-331007 
(M1) accounting for 84.2% of AUC of total plasma radioactivity. GS-566500 (M2) was observed in plasma 
at levels of 10.6%. In urine GS-331007 and GS-566500 were major components. In another study using 
female rats, plasma M1 was 53.9% and M2 was present at 32%. In rat liver three metabolites, M1 
(4.8%), M2 (0.9%, GS-566500) and M3 (GS-606965) were observed, the latter a minor component. The 
parent compound was not detected in plasma, urine or feces. The major pathway in rat was hydrolysis of 
GS-7977 to GS-331007 and minor pathways were hydrolysis of GS-7977 to GS-566500 and GS-606965. 
In dogs following a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg of sofosbuvir three metabolites in plasma were identified, 
GS-331007, GS-566500 and M4 (proposed glucuronidation product of GS-606965), accounting for 
93.4%, 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively, of total plasma AUC. Parent compound amounted to 4.5%. In dog 
(and mouse) the majority of a radioactive dose was recovered in urine within 8 to 12 hours. 
GS-331007 and GS-566500 were detected in all species with GS-331007 being the major drug related 
material in all species and all matrices. In plasma, urine and feces of all species administered sofosbuvir 
the primary metabolite detected was GS-331007 accounting for >80% of total exposure. In rat liver and 
plasma GS-566500 was also detected. The metabolite profile was overall comparable between 
non-pregnant, pregnant and postpartum rats and in milk of postpartum rats with GS-331007 and 2 
sulfate conjugates of GS-331007 being the major metabolites. 
The major species used in toxicology studies, rat and dog appear to have been adequately characterised 
pharmacokinetically. Less data is available for the rabbit, the second species used in studies on 
reproduction toxicity, but it has been ascertained that GS-331007 is formed in this specie. Some data 
indicate species differences in the disposition of sofosbuvir that could partly relate both to rate of 
hydrolysis in primary matrices as well as to the extent of formation of the active triphosphate metabolite. 
Thus, sofosbuvir can be detected in human plasma, but not in species (rat) used in general toxicology 
studies, micronucleus study (mouse) and reproduction toxicity studies (rat) also indicating that, in 
contrast to the major metabolite (M1) that is formed in all species, the potential toxicity of sofosbuvir may

Page 18/80 
  
  
not have been fully characterised. In addition, the extent of exposure to the active triphosphate seemed 
variable and while this could be detected in rat liver, levels could not be determined in mouse liver. 
Formation of the triphosphate was shown in hepatocytes from human, dog, monkey and rat. In monkey, 
liver levels were below detection. Monkey was though not used in studies on general toxicology. 
Ledipasvir  
Ledipasvir has low aqueous solubility (<1 µg/ml at pH 7.0) and solubility in simulated intestinal fluid was 
shown to be low. Oral bioavailability of ledipasvir was 32% in rat, 53% in dog and 41% in monkey. In the 
mouse, rat and dog, the systemic exposure increased less than proportional with dose. In mouse 
exposure increased less than proportional with dose from 30 to 300 mg/kg, increasing dose from 300 to 
600 mg/kg did not generally result in an increased exposure. In female New Zealand White rabbits 
systemic exposure to ledipasvir in a formulation containing 75% propylene glycol and 25% Solutol HS 15, 
increased greater than proportionally with oral doses from 10 to 100 mg/kg, and increased less than 
proportionally with dose from 100 to 300 mg/kg and no further increase in exposure from 300 to 600 
mg/kg was evident. 
Ledipasvir was highly protein bound, > 99.8 in all species. In male mouse given a single oral 20 mg/kg 
dose of 14C-ledipasvir radioactivity was widely distributed to almost all tissues by 3 hours post-dose. 
Highest levels (not including the GI tract) were detected in gall bladder, liver, harderian gland, and 
kidney. Low and trace levels of radioactivity were measured in testes and brain, respectively, suggesting 
low transfer across the blood-testes and blood-brain barriers, but levels in brain choroid plexus were 
comparable with blood levels. The elimination half-lives (t½) for total radioactivity were 12.3 and 10.9 
hours in blood and plasma, respectively. 
In male intact and bile-duct cannulated Sprague-Dawley and intact Long-Evans (LE) rats given a single 
oral 10 mg/kg dose of 14C-ledipasvir a wide distribution to most tissues was evident. Tissues with highest 
maximum concentrations of radioactivity (excluding the GI tract) included liver, adrenal gland, urinary 
bladder, kidney, and pancreas in both Sprague-Dawley and LE rats. Low levels of 14C-ledipasvir -derived 
radioactivity persisted longer in the eye uveal tract of pigmented rats, but there was no marked difference 
in distribution to pigmented and non-pigmented skin. No radioactivity was detected in the brain 
cerebellum and cerebrum or the testes consistent with low levels of 14C-ledipasvir-derived radioactivity 
crossing the blood-testes and blood-brain barriers. 
In a peri/postnatal study in rat an approximate proportional with dose increase in systemic exposure in F0 
female rats on gestation day 6 and lactation day 10 was recorded. Exposure in the F1 neonate rats 
increased greater than proportionally with the increase in the maternal dose level from 10 to 100 
mg/kg/day, with no notable difference between sexes (< 2-fold). 
Overall the in vitro metabolic stability of ledipasvir indicated slow rates of hepatic biotransformation. 
The metabolite profiles of radioactivity derived from carbon 14 labelled ledipasvir showed that the major 
circulating component was the unchanged parent drug representing 96.9%, 97.2%, 87.1%, 87.5%, and 
98.3% of total plasma AUC following oral administration of 14C-ledipasvir to CD-1 mice, rasH2 transgenic 
mice, rats, dogs, and human subjects, respectively. Unchanged parent drug was also the major 
component in feces in mice, rats, dogs, and humans accounting for greater than 80% of the total in feces. 
Unchanged parent drug accounted for 43.5% and 79.8% of the radioactivity recovered in bile from bile 
duct cannulated rats and dogs, respectively. 
Less than 1% of the total dose was recovered in urine from all nonclinical species, and 1.14% of total dose 
was recovered in urine from human subjects. No single metabolite in urine accounted for more than 1% 
of the total in any species. 
Metabolites identified were primarily formed via oxidation and N-demethylcarboxylation. 
Oxy-ledipasvir-A (M19) was present in feces of mouse and human and in the urine of mouse. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 19/80 
  
  
Oxy-ledipasvir-B (M15) was the only quantifiable circulating metabolite detected in dog plasma, 
contributing to approximately 5% of the total circulating radioactivity, and was also present in rat and dog 
bile and dog feces. Another oxidative metabolite, Oxy-ledipasvir-C (M16) was present in rat bile. 
N-descarboxymethyl-ledipasvir (M9) was identified in mouse plasma and feces, rat bile and feces, and in 
dog bile. 
The excretion of ledipasvir was determined after administration of a single oral dose of 14C ledipasvir to 
male CD-1 mouse at 20 mg/kg, to male intact and bile duct cannulated (BDC) Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 
mg/kg, and to male intact and bile duct cannulated dogs at 10 mg/kg. Excretion of radioactivity was 
measured in urine, feces, and bile through 168 hours after dosing. A mean of 93.9%, 92.9%, and 95.8% 
of the administered radioactivity was excreted in feces from mouse, rat, and dog, respectively. Less than 
0.9% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine from all three species. 
By comparing the amount of radioactivity recovered in bile with the total amount of radioactivity in bile 
and urine, it was estimated that approximately 86% and 98% of the absorbed dose was eliminated via 
biliary excretion in BDC rats and dogs, respectively. Since unchanged parent drug accounted for 43.5% 
and 79.8% of the radioactivity recovered in bile from bile duct cannulated rats and dogs, respectively, 
biliary excretion of unchanged parent compound was a major route of elimination for ledipasvir.  In rat, 
based on the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile after an oral dose, approximately 3.5% of the orally 
administered dose was absorbed. In another study on the excretion of ledipasvir in bile duct cannulated 
dogs, approximately 71% of the total dose was recovered as unchanged parent compound in bile after 
intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg. In dog, based on the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile 
after an oral dose, approximately 19% of the orally administered dose was absorbed. The apparent 
discrepancy between the estimated dose absorbed (in rat 3.5%) and oral bioavailability (in rat 32%) may 
relate partly to level of dose and partly to physiological constraints of the model used. 
Based on the extent of metabolism and pattern of metabolites the species used in toxicology studies are 
considered relevant. There were no significant metabolites formed that were unique for humans. 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
Data generated from in vitro studies Caco-2 cell monolayers suggested that sofosbuvir intestinal 
absorption will be increased in the context of the fixed dose combination due to inhibition of intestinal 
transporters by ledipasvir. 
The effect of ledipasvir on the formation of the active sofosbuvir triphosphate (GS-461203) in primary 
human hepatocytes after incubation with sofosbuvir was assessed in vitro. In the presence of 10 μM 
ledipasvir, GS-461203 increased from 49.7 to 69.8 pmol/million cells.  In primary human hepatocytes, 
additive antiviral activity was observed for the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in an HCV 
genotype 1a replicon system. 
No nonclinical excretion studies have been done with the combination. Based on the different routes of 
elimination, the coadministration of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is not anticipated to change the excretion of 
the individual compounds. Sofosbuvir is eliminated, following metabolism to the predominant metabolite 
GS-331007 renally, while ledipasvir elimination as unchanged parent in bile is a major route of ledipasvir 
elimination. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Sofosbuvir 
In the non-clinical testing program, sofosbuvir was administered orally to CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley 
rats, and Beagle dogs for general toxicity evaluation. The diastereomeric mixture GS-9851 was used in 
early nonclinical and clinical studies, but the single diastereomer sofosbuvir (SOF) was chosen for 
Assessment report

Page 20/80 
  
  
development and registration. However, it should be noted that exposure to sofosbuvir was not obtained 
in rodents due to high esterase activity and that the level of exposure to the active moiety, the 
triphosphate, which is mainly present intracellular, is generally not known in the toxicology studies. 
Exposure margins are therefore primarily calculated using the major metabolite GS-331007.  The only 
dose-related substance with a systemic exposure of >10% of total radioactivity was GS-331007 also 
indicating that only this metabolite would require qualification in non-clinical studies. 
Single dose toxicity study was performed with GS 9851/PSI-7851 (the diastereomeric mixture). No 
adverse effects were noted in rat up to a highest dose of 1800 mg/kg. 
Sofosbuvir was generally well tolerated for up to 3 months in the mouse, 6 months in the rat, and 9 
months in the Beagle dog. Target organs for toxicity were the heart, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and 
hematopoietic cells. Pre-terminal mortalities occurred in rats at high dose levels (27- fold clinical 
exposure as based on AUC), and in a single dog dosed at 500 mg/kg/day for 6 months (24-fold clinical 
exposure as based on AUC). 
In the 14-day dose range finding study in mice, one male dosed at 1500 mg/kg/day was found dead on 
day 10. The cause of death was not determined. In the 3-month mouse study, pre-terminal mortality 
occurred at all dose levels (>100 mg/kg/day), and also in controls and together the data do not 
substantiate a clear causative link between sofosbuvir treatment and pre-terminal mortality in mice.  In 
the 7-day rat study, 2000 mg/kg/day resulted in early mortalities probably due to myocardial 
degeneration. This finding was also present in 2/3 surviving females dosed at 2000 mg/kg/day, as 
evaluated after a 14-day recovery period. The margin to the NOAEL for myocardial degeneration and 
associated mortality in the 7-day rat study is small (3-fold based on AUC) but cardiac toxicity/mortality 
occurred only at the highest dose level (2000 mg/kg/day) and no doses between 250 and 2000 
mg/kg/day were tested. In longer duration studies (at 9-fold exposure levels to clinical AUC in 6 month 
study and in carcinogenicity study), no cardiac toxicity or associated mortalities occurred. In the 9-month 
dog study, one male dosed at 500 mg/kg/day was pre-terminally sacrificed on Day 172 with findings of 
vacuolar degeneration observed in the myocardial muscle fibers. This may have been a response to 
hypotension, tachycardia and hypovolaemia secondary to haemorrhagic enteritis. Overall due to the fact 
that hemorrhage in the stomach or intestine was observed in two high dose dogs in the 7-day and 
1-month studies, respectively, it seemed likely that the hemorrhagic enteritis in the preterminally killed 
dog in the 9-month study was due to treatment with sofosbuvir. A direct effect on the myocardium cannot 
be completely excluded but no histopathological myocardial changes were observed in other dogs, in any 
of the conducted studies. In a 14-day bridging toxicity study comparing GS-9851 and SOF at 500 
mg/kg/day, one male rat dosed with GS-9851 showed minimal myofiber degeneration located at the apex 
of the heart, a change which may potentially be treatment-related. No complement was requested to the 
applicant. 
A short duration rat toxicology study with sofosbuvir at dose levels up to 2000 mg/kg to determine its 
contribution to the heart degeneration and inflammation observed with GS-9851 is ongoing. This study 
could not only more clearly define drug-related exposure multiples (based on heart findings) but, if indeed 
contributing to heart toxicity, further characterize this toxicity by including treatment-free groups (to 
evaluate reversibility) and additional study endpoints (e.g., circulating biomarkers of cardiac toxicity, 
heart specific sofosbuvir and related metabolite concentrations).The applicant will submit the final study 
report in Q1 2015. 
QT prologation in the 7-day study, but not in longer dog studies, was present in males dosed at 1500 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to levels 90-fold higher based on Cmax of GS-331007 (likely exposure to 
sofosbuvir was also significant although not directly determined) than expected clinical. Taken together, 
the animal data do not indicate that sofosbuvir is likely to produce QT prolongation in patients treated at 
the recommended dose of 400 mg.

Diarrhea and other clinical signs related to effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurred in all 
repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats. Some of these effects also occurred in control animals, suggesting 
that the vehicle may have contributed. No related histopathological changes were noted and effects were 
reversible upon cessation of dosing, indicating no major concern for human safety despite the small 
exposure margins. Diarrhea and emesis were also present in all dog repeated-dose toxicity studies. The 
lowest NOAEL for GI effects in the dog was 20 mg/kg/day in the 3-month study, corresponding to a 2-fold 
exposure margin based on AUC.  Hemorrhage was present in the lamina propria of the colon in one high 
dose recovery dog in the 7-day study, in the lamina propria of the stomach pylorus region in a dog treated 
at 500 mg/kg/day in the 3-month study and in the lamina propria of the jejunum in the preterminally 
killed high dose dog in the 9-month study. The lowest NOAEL for hemorrhage in the GI tract was 100 
mg/kg/day in the 6-month phase of the 9-month study, corresponding to a 10-fold exposure margin 
based on AUC. Thus, there is an acceptable margin to these more severe GI effects in dogs. 
Increased liver weights were observed at > 100 mg/kg/day in the 1-month rat study, at > 30 mg/kg/day 
in the 7-day dog study, and at 500 and > 100 mg/kg/day in the 1-month and 3-month dog studies, 
respectively. At the high dose level (1500 mg/kg/day) in the 7-day dog study, this organ weight increase 
correlated with hepatocellular hypertrophy. The increased liver weights in both rats and dogs, as well as 
the hepatocellular hypertrophy in dogs, are most likely related to the induction of drug-metabolizing 
enzymes, which is an adaptive and non-adverse effect.  Histopathological liver findings at 1500 
mg/kg/day in the 7-day dog study included hepatocyte apoptosis, microvesiculation, decreased 
intracellular glycogen, and Kupffer cell pigmentation. These findings were associated with increased ALT, 
AST, ALP and bilirubin. Except for the decreased glycogen, the margin to the NOAEL for these effects was 
13-fold based on AUC. No histopathological liver findings were present in the longer term dog studies at 
doses up to 500 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a 24-fold exposure margin (GS-331007) as based on AUC 
in the 9-month study. 
Effects on erythropoiesis were present in the 7-day rat study and in all dog studies, from 7 days up to 9 
months. The lowest exposure margin to NOAEL in dogs for these effects was 5-fold, as based on AUC. 
Hematology analysis showed decreased red blood cell count and lower haemoglobin and/or hematocrit 
concentrations. The decreased erythron mass was reflected in bone marrow changes such as lower 
percentage of erythroid precursors and depression of erythropoiesis. Both the peripheral and bone 
marrow changes were reversible. In the 6-month phase of the 9-month dog study, there were bone 
marrow alterations at the high dose (500 mg/kg/day), which were not present at the end of the 9-month 
study. Exposure margins were low. Such effects were also observed in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, when 
sofosbuvir has been co-administered with ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon. Both these 
substances are known to cause hematologic toxicity. 
Lymphocyte depletion/necrosis and thymus atrophy occurred in rats and dogs treated at high dose levels 
and are considered to reflect generalized stress. Adrenal cortical hypertrophy at 1500 mg/kg/day in the 
7-day dog study is also considered to be related to stress. These findings were reversible upon cessation 
of dosing. 
Activated partial thromboplastin time was increased at 1500 mg/kg/day in the 7-day dog study (not 
reversible after 14 days), and at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month phase of the 9-month dog study 
(reversible after 1 month). The increase was slight, and there did not seem to be any correlation with the 
intestinal hemorrhage present in the pre-terminally killed high dose dog. 
Transient lameness was noted in dogs at ≥ 100 mg/kg in the 9-month study possibly due to incidental 
injury. No incidents of lameness were observed in vehicle-treated control dogs. It should be noted that 
limping/lameness was present in single male dogs at 100 mg/kg/day in the 1- and 3-months studies. 
Even so, it is agreed that no causal relationship has been established.

A few other findings (e.g. organ weight changes, alterations in urine parameters, etc.) with potential or 
uncertain relationship to treatment with sofosbuvir were either of small magnitude or inconsistent 
between studies, and thus their relevance to the human clinical situation is questionable. 
The diastereomeric mixture of SOF (GS 9851/PSI-7851) was shown to be negative in vitro in the S 
typhimurium reverse mutation assay and in a mammalian chromosome aberration test performed in 
primary human lymphocytes. An in vivo chromosome aberration assay in mouse was also negative. A 
sufficiently high exposure of the two metabolites GS-566500 (AUClast 194(M)/134(F) μgxh/mL) and 
GS-331007 (AUClast 133(M)/115(F) μgxh/mL) was achieved, while exposure to SOF (GS-9851) was low. 
The results suggest that SOF does not have any genotoxic potential.  
There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential of sofosbuvir in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies up 
to the highest dose tested where exposure to GS-331007 were 7/18 (male/female) and 9/11 
(male/female) times higher in mice and rats, respectively, than the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir 
once daily. Exposure to sofosbuvir was not obtained in rodents due to high esterase activity, and the 
exposure margins are therefore calculated using the major metabolite GS-331007. Treatment with 
PSI-7977 did not affect survival of animals, except for an increased early mortality in low dose male mice. 
No treatment-related tumours were observed.  No PSI-7977-related cardiac or skeletal muscle toxicity 
was observed in the rodent carcinogenicity studies. The only treatment-related histopathological effect 
was inflammation in the nasal turbinates, probably due to local irritation in connection with reflux and 
gavage dosing. 
Daily oral doses of SOF at up to 500 mg/kg for 28 days (males) or 14 days (females) prior to cohabitation, 
during cohabitation, and through scheduled termination (males) or Day 7 of gestation (females) did not 
adversely affect mating, fertility, or embryo survival at any dose level. In addition sofosbuvir did not 
affect reproductive organ weight or produce macroscopic findings or histopathologic findings in 
reproductive organs in either sex in the performed repeat dose toxicity studies. No effects on fertility are 
therefore expected. 
Embryo-foetal studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats sofosbuvir did not affect intrauterine 
growth and survival. No effects were either seen on external, visceral, and skeletal foetal morphology at 
dose levels up to 500 mg/kg/day, considered the maternal and foetal NOAEL. At this dose, the margin of 
exposure for GS-331007 compared with expected clinical was 10. Pregnant rabbits tolerated daily oral 
doses of PSI-7977 up to 300 mg/kg during the period of major organogenesis without any adverse effects 
on either the dams or developing foetuses. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is considered to be 300 
mg/kg/day, which produced a systemic exposure of 8.66 and 200 μgxh/mL for SOF and its metabolite 
GS-331007, respectively, corresponding to exposure margins for SOF and GS-331007 of 10 and 28, 
respectively, when compared to the mean AUC at the recommended clinical dose (400 mg). 
In the prenatal and postnatal development study performed in rats no adverse sofosbuvir-related effects 
were noted in F0 females at any dosage level during gestation and lactation and F1 postnatal survival, 
body weights, developmental landmarks, startle response, motor activity, learning and memory and 
reproductive performance were unaffected. Intrauterine growth and survival of F2 foetuses were also 
unaffected. No treatment-related external malformations or developmental variations were noted in F2 
foetuses. Animals were not exposed to significant levels of SOF while exposure to the metabolite 
GS-331007 were 12 times the expected maximum clinical exposure in F0 dams after exposure to 500 
mg/kg/day at lactation day 10 (AUC0-24 83 μgxh/mL) and ~6 times at gestation day 6(AUC0-24 40 
μgxh/mL). F1 Pups were found to be exposed to significant but ~50 times lower levels of the metabolite 
GS-331007 (AUC0-24 1.5 μgxh/mL in the 500 mg/kg/day group) on post-natal day 10, but not to be 
exposed to GS-566500. 
According to the relevant Guideline the dose range tested by the applicant should have covered a dose 
resulting in minimal maternal toxicity such as e.g. decreased body weight or food consumption.  No 
Assessment report

Page 23/80 
  
  
effects were seen on body weight or food consumption in the studies performed and it is concluded that 
the dose range used in the studies was not high enough to fully explore the potential of sofosbuvir to 
induce reproductive and developmental toxicity. In addition, due to the high plasma esterase activity in 
rats and absence of sofosbuvir in plasma it is concluded that the studies on embryo foetal toxicity in 
rabbits, where plasma levels higher than that expected in the clinical situation was detected, is the only 
study where possible effects of sofosbuvir per se have been investigated. This is also reflected in the 
SmPC. 
No toxicity studies in juvenile animals were conducted with SOF which is considered to be acceptable 
since sofosbuvir will initially be registered for adults only and since the repeat dose and developmental 
and reproductive toxicity studies did not reveal any adverse effects on tissues that may be developing in 
the paediatric population. 
Sofosbuvir is predicted to be a non-corrosive/ non-severe eye irritant based on results from an in vitro 
Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay and is classified as a “non-irritant” in a dermal irritation 
study in rabbits. In addition results from a Local lymph node assay indicate that SOF is not a skin 
sensitizer. 
Phenol, GS-566500, GS-606965 and GS-331007 are metabolites of SOF and are considered to be 
toxicologically qualified at the proposed levels in drug product (0.5 % at shelf life). The proposed 
specification levels of 0.5 % (at shelf life), equal to ~0.04 mg/kg/day (2 mg/day/50kg), for GS-607699 
and GS-607670 in drug product and the process impurities GS-491241, GS-615014 and GS-617190 
present in the drug substance, are also considered to be acceptable from a toxicological point of view. 
Fourteen day bridging toxicity studies comparing the isomeric mixture (PSI-7851) with the single isomer 
SOF (PSI-7977) have also been performed in rat and dog. No differences were detected and the toxicity 
and systemic exposure profiles were concluded to be similar for PSI-7851 and PSI-7977 in both studies. 
No phototoxicity study has been performed with sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir does not absorb light within the 
range of 290 to 700 nm and no accumulation in dermal or ocular tissues has been detected. 
Ledipasvir 
Overall the non-clinical toxicological documentation, although minimal, is considered to comply with 
current ICH and other relevant guidelines. In the non-clinical testing program, ledipasvir was 
administered orally to rasH2 transgenic mouse, Spraque-Dawley rat and Beagle dog for general toxicity 
evaluation. The oral route was chosen as this is the route of administration in patients. Non-clinical 
studies were performed using the free base of ledipasvir, the D-tartrate and the acetone solvate. The 
ledipasvir free base was used for the pivotal repeat dose toxicology studies and early non-clinical studies. 
The acetone solvate is considered the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is converted to ledipasvir 
spray-dried dispersion, an amorphous free base, through downstream product manufacture. 
General toxicity 
No specific single dose toxicity studies were conducted which is acceptable. Acute effects were derived 
from repeat dose toxicity studies and pharmacokinetic studies and the micronucleus study indicated that 
single oral doses of ledipasvir are well tolerated up to 450/600 mg/kg in the rat. 
Ledipasvir was generally well tolerated for up to 4 weeks in the mouse, 26 weeks in the rat and 39 weeks 
in the Beagle dog. Transient decreases in mean body weight gain and mean food consumption were noted 
both in rat and dog, although not in the 39-week dog study. Except for in the 2-week study in dog, effects 
on body weight and food consumption were not considered adverse. The maximum tolerated dose was 
not reached and no target organ of toxicity was identified by the applicant in any of the studies. In the 
mouse and rat studies, there were some equivocal signs indicative of adverse liver effects that overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 24/80 
  
  
were concluded not related to the test article. Other, potentially test article-related microscopic findings 
noted in the 26 week rat study included: 
- Minimal paracortical lymphocyte hyperplasia in the mesenteric lymph nodes (4/10 M at 100 mg/kg/d, 
and in F: 1, 3, 3, 2 at 0, 10, 30, 100 mg/kg) and an increase of the prostatic inflammation (4/10 M) at 100 
mg/kg/d was observed with ledipasvir at the interim sacrifice (week 13) in the 26 week study. However, 
these effects were not observed at week 26. 
- at week 26 in rats, a malignant C-cell carcinoma in the thyroid gland of a single male at 100 mg/kg/day 
was observed. This was not considered test article-related by the Applicant since neoplasia is occasionally 
seen as an incidental finding in rats. This carcinoma is more commonly observed in 104 week studies. The 
applicant will submit the final carcinogenicity for ledipasvir in December 2015. 
In the dog effects on the brain in terms of large cerebral ventricles were indicated but concluded not 
related to the test article. Otherwise no potentially adverse test article-related clinical pathological or 
anatomic pathological findings were identified. Based on mean AUC0-24h values at the proposed NOAELs of 
100 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg in the chronic rat (56 µgxh/ml) and dog (62.6 µgxh/ml) studies, respectively, 
there is an approximately 7-fold (6.6- and 7.3-fold, respectively) margin to the mean AUCtau at the clinical 
dose of 90 mg (8.53 µgxh/ml). 
It should be noted that a rather high individual variability in toxicokinetics resulted in an overlapping 
exposure, especially between mid and high dose levels, and thus a lack of a dose-dependent response 
does not necessarily preclude a relation to the test article. 
As the maximum tolerated dose was not reached and no clear target organ toxicity of ledipasvir could be 
identified, the repeat dose toxicity studies do not allow for a complete characterisation of the toxicological 
profile of ledipasvir. However, maximum feasible oral doses in optimised vehicles, though restricted by 
the limited solubility of Ledipasvir, have been used and the exposures achieved were estimated to be 
close to saturation. 
Liver 
In the 4-week mouse study, minor increases in mean absolute and relative liver weights and alkaline 
phosphatase were noted in males at the high dose level of 300 mg/kg. These effects were small and did 
not correlate with histopathological findings and could be considered as not adverse. In the 2-week rat 
study minor clinical pathological changes in the 100 mg/kg dose group or from the 30 mg/kg dose 
included increased cholesterol in females and males, increased alanine transferase and alkaline 
phosphatase in males and increased triglycerides in females. As the effects in males correlated with 
findings, although few and not clearly dose-dependent, of minor to moderate necrosis in hepatocytes, 
minor adverse test article-related effects in the liver cannot be excluded. In the 26-week rat study there 
were slight reversible increases in alanine transferase and minimal reversible decrease in glucose in 
males in the 100 mg/kg dose group at week 26. These findings were correlated with non-reversible bile 
duct hyperplasia (although present in 2-3 animals in all ledipasvir groups, in males). Based on the low 
incidence, the absence of a clear dose response, the lack of correlative effects on e.g. bilirubin, the 
presence in one of the female recovery control rats and being regarded as a common age-related finding 
in rats, bile duct hyperplasia was not considered test article-related. 
Brain 
Large cerebral ventricles with and without microscopic correlates of minimal dilatation of ventricles were 
observed in one female dog given 30 mg/kg and one female dog given 10 mg/kg, respectively, in the 
2–week study. Due to the dose response in terms of presence of a microscopic correlate in the high dose 
animal it is not clear why this finding was judged as unrelated to the test article. Large cerebral ventricles 
were present also in the 39-week study at terminal sacrifice. One female dog in the mid dose group had 
large cerebral ventricles without microscopic findings and 1 male dog in the low dose group had large and 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 25/80 
  
  
dilated cerebral ventricles. As the incidence was comparable to general historical control data, the large 
and dilated cerebral ventricles were considered as spontaneous and incidental findings.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Ledipasvir was tested in vitro for genotoxicity up to cytotoxic concentrations. Negative results were 
reported in gene mutation tests and tests for chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes. The in 
vivo rat micronucleus test was negative. Plasma exposure at the high dose in the rat micronucleus study 
was approximately 8-fold the expected human exposure. Taken together the data did not indicate any 
significant genotoxic potential of ledipasvir. 
A 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study and a 2-year rat oral gavage carcinogenicity study with 
ledipasvir are being conducted. This is acceptable in view of the proposed short term treatment duration. 
The applicant will submit these studies in December 2015. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Reproductive function was evaluated in rat and rabbit. Daily oral doses of ledipasvir up to 100 mg/kg to 
rats for 28 days (males) or 15 days (females) prior to cohabitation, during cohabitation, and through 
scheduled termination (males) or Day 7 of gestation (females) did not affect mating and fertility 
parameters and no test article-related necropsy finding or effects on the reproduction organ weights were 
reported. All sperm parameters were considered unaffected. Slight decreases in mean numbers of corpora 
lutea, implantation and viable embryos in the 100 mg/kg dose group were considered adverse and 
potentially test article-related. Based on mean AUC values, the female reproductive NOEL of 30 mg/kg 
corresponds to a 2.8-fold margin to the expected clinical systemic exposure. For the male reproductive 
NOEL of 100 mg/kg the exposure margin is 7-fold. 
In the pivotal embryofoetal developmental rat study of oral daily doses up to 100 mg/kg from the period 
of implantation to closure of the hard palate no relevant effects were observed on maternal macroscopy, 
uterine weight, embryo-foetal viability, mean foetal weights or foetal external or visceral variations or 
visceral and skeletal malformations. Increased total foetal and litter incidences of skeletal variations 
affecting the vertebrae, sternea and ribs were, however, evident at the high dose level of 100 mg/kg. In 
the absence of other evidence of foetal toxicity or associated malformations, these effects are likely 
secondary to the decrease in maternal body weight gain (-67%; control body weights 238.2±11.5 g to 
247.0±13.5 g and high dose body weights of 239.8±12.2 g to 242.7±13.3 g on gestation days 6-8) and 
food reduction (-12% on gestation days 6-18) observed at 100 mg/kg. Based on mean AUC values on 
gestation day 17, the 100 and 30 mg/kg doses give a 4.6- and 2.1-fold margin, respectively, to the 
expected clinical systemic exposure. 
Possible embryofetal developmental effects in terms of skeletal variations were observed also in the 
pivotal study in rabbits given oral daily doses up to 180 mg/kg during the organogenesis. While body 
weight loss and decreased food consumption were noted for does at the high dose of 300 mg/kg in the 
dose range finding study, there were no significant effects on body weight or food consumption at the high 
dose of 180 mg/kg in the pivotal study. Maternal macroscopy, uterine weight, embryo-foetal viability, 
mean foetal weights, foetal external or visceral variations and visceral or skeletal malformations also 
appeared unaffected by ledipasvir. Skeletal variations affecting the hyoid, vertebrae, sternea and ribs 
with a positive trend or a significant increase in foetal and/or litter incidence were not considered to be 
related to ledipasvir as they were either regarded as common variations or noted to be within laboratory 
historical control ranges and not associated with any increase in malformations. 
Based on mean AUC values on gestation day 20, the 180, 60 and 30 mg/kg doses give a 2.4-, 2.3- and 
0.80-fold margin, respectively, to the expected clinical systemic exposure. No metabolism data is 
available and so the rabbit data are subject to some uncertainties. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014

Overall, the skeletal variations in embryo-foetal development studies in rat and rabbit and the possible 
delayed foetal development could be considered non-adverse. 
In the pre and postnatal study in rats oral administration of ledipasvir up to doses of 100 mg/kg from the 
period of implantation to weaning of offspring did not significantly affect maternal function such as 
maintenance of pregnancy, delivery and nursing. General toxic effects in F0 dams were evident at the 
high dose as decreases in mean body weight gain and mean food consumption resulting in a lower mean 
body weight. At the high dose decreased body weight gains were also noted in F1 offspring which resulted 
in a lower mean body weights throughout the postnatal period, but otherwise no explicit toxic effects were 
reported. 
Based on the general toxic effects on body weight, and for F0 animals also on food consumption, F0 
maternal NOAEL and F1 neonatal/developmental NOAEL were set to 30 mg/kg. Based on mean AUC, this 
dose level corresponds to exposure levels on gestation day 6 and lactation day 10 that are similar to and 
1.3-fold, respectively, the expected clinical systemic exposure. For the F1 neurobehaviour/F1 
reproductive and F2 neonatal NOAEL of 100 mg/kg the exposure margin is 2.6-fold at gestation day 6 and 
4.4-fold at lactation day 10. 
On lactation day 10 the mean AUC values in F1 pups were approximately 25% of that in maternal animals, 
which demonstrates that ledipasvir is transferred to the pups via the milk.

Local tolerance and antigenity 
Based on results from an in vitro bovine corneal opacity and permeability and a dermal irritation study in 
rabbits, ledipasvir is not predicted to have any relevant potential for either eye irritation or dermal 
irritation. Furthermore, results from a local lymph node assay indicate that ledipasvir is not a skin 
sensitizer. 
Impurities 
Impurities, which may be present in the drug substance and/or the drug product, have been 
toxicologically qualified. Development and stability studies have identified ledipasvir related degradation 
product expected in ledipasvir/sofosbuvir tablets. 
Bridging toxicity studies 
The NOAEL for ledipasvir and ledipasvir tartrate following 2 weeks of oral once daily administration were 
set to 100 mg/kg/day. Based on mean AUC on Day 14, the exposure to ledipasvir for the ledipasvir 
tartrate salt was approximately 3-fold lower than for ledipasvir free base. 
Phototoxicity 
Ledipasvir did not exhibit any potential for phototoxicity in a mouse study at single oral doses up to 300 
mg/kg. The female albino hairless mouse was selected for the study and cited as a documented test 
system for evaluating phototoxic potential of materials. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is a pro-drug and the active substance is the triphosphate GS-461203. Neither the 
pro-drug/SOF nor the active moiety/GS-461203 enter the environment at >10% of the administered 
dose. The focus of the environmental risk assessment of SOF is instead GS-331007, the only drug residue 
detected in total excreta at >10% of the applied radioactive dose (GS-331007 accounted for 79.6%). 
The mean partition coefficient was 0.398, 0.286 and 0.0593, at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively, (log Kow 
-0.417, -0.576 and -1.28, respectively) and GS-331007 is therefore not a PBT-substance. A refined 
market penetration of 3.5% (the highest relevant nationwide estimated prevalence) was used to calculate 
a refined PECsurface water value. The refined PECsurface water of 7.0 µg/L is significantly higher than the 
action limit of 0.01 μg/L. A Phase IIA assessment has therefore been performed and since a partition to 
sediment was indicated (>10% AR shifted after 14 days) a further assessment with a sediment dweller in 
Phase IIB has also been initiated. Since results indicate that GS-331007 does not adsorb to soils or 
activated sludges, aquatic toxicity has been the focus of Phase IIA analysis. 
None of the ratios between the predicted environmental concentrations and predicted no effect levels for 
the Sewage treatment plant-, Surface water- or Groundwater-compartment were above 1 and no further 
studies are therefore required. In the Phase IIB analysis on sediment dweller the risk quotient was also 
found to be below 1. Based on the data presented it is concluded that the environmentally relevant 
residue of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Ledipasvir 
The available data do not allow concluding definitively on the potential risk of ledipasvir to the 
environment. 
Since the slow-stir 1-octanol/aqueous buffer pH 7.4 partition coefficient of LDV was determined to be log 
6.9, the compound is considered to be potentially bioaccumulative (B) and a PBT assessment is required. 
However, the Applicant argues that ledipasvir is inherently unstable in aqueous solutions (due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 28/80 
  
  
photolysis) and will not significantly exist in the aqueous phase (photolysis and sorption) and can 
therefore not be considered to be a PBT substance. This is not agreed based on available data indicating 
persistence (e.g. DT50 in sediment exceeds the PBT-criteria of 120 days, a significant shifting (> 10 %) 
to the sediment compartment where photolysis is not relevant), the lack of a fully investigation of the 
bioaccumulation criterion and that low water solubility and high degree of sorption is not considered as 
adequate data to conclude on the potential for bioaccumulation. The applicant will provide a 
bioaccumulation study in sediment dwellers (OECD 315) in 3Q 2015. 
The worst case PECsurfacewater based on the daily dose of 90 mg is 0.45 µg/L and exceeds the action limit of 
0.01 µg/L. A Phase II assessment has been performed. 
The Risk Quotients (RQ;PEC/PNEC) for the different compartments are shown in the table below: 
Compartment 
Sewage Treatment Plant 
Surface water 
Fish 
Aquatic invertebrates 
Algae 
Groundwater 
RQ 
≤ 5.0 x 10-7 
3.3 x 10-3 
6.8 X 10-2 
≤ 5.3 x 10-4 
9.3 x 10-4 
The PNEC for ledipasvir for sediment dwellers was derived by dividing the NOEC of 2133 mg/kg dwt by an 
assessment factor of 100. The PECsediment was estimated using the equilibrium partitioning model for 
suspended matter (based on the refined PECsurface water).  
PECsediment/PNECsediment = 0.13 / 21.33 = 6.1 x 10-3 
All risk quotients are well below 1. However, it is not possible to conclude definitively on the potential risk 
of ledipasvir to the environment until the results of the OECD 315 study is available.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is a prodrug that is hydrolysed to an intermediate subsequently phosphorylated intracellularly 
to an active triphosphate form with activity against the HCV NS5B RNA polymerase. No significant 
inhibition of host polymerases by the active metabolite was evident. Sofosbuvir also had no remarkable 
effects on parameters monitored to investigate mitochondrial toxicity in cell based assays. Screening for 
secondary activity was conducted using the isomeric mixture and GS-331007 at concentrations of 10 µM. 
Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data with sofosbuvir seem overall sufficient. The parent drug 
sofosbuvir is, in contrast to in humans, not detectable in rodent plasma. 
Sofosbuvir seemed overall well tolerated in general toxicity studies of up to 9 months in rat and dog. 
Effects at high doses noted in toxicity studies were coupled to the gastrointestinal tract, liver and the 
haematological system. Reproductive toxicity was studied in rat and rabbit and while no relevant potential 
for adverse reproductive effects was evident, the high dose likely was suboptimal in these studies. 
Studies in vitro and in vivo for genotoxic potential were negative and consistent with a low mutagenic 
potential of sofosbuvir. Long-term carcinogencity studies in mouse and rat did not indicate any treatment 
related tumourigenic potential of sofosbuvir.

Ledipasvir 
Ledipasvir targets the NS5A protein of the viral genome. Antiviral activity against the 1a and 1b genotype 
in vitro was reflected in EC50 values from 0.031 to 0.004 nM.  Secondary pharmacology screening and 
safety pharmacology studies encompassing respiratory, central nervous system and cardiovascular 
systems did not show any effects expected to be of relevance for the clinical use. 
Pharmacokinetic studies with ledipasvir showed very high protein binding, wide distribution, slow 
metabolism and excretion primarily in bile and faeces mainly as the parent compound. 
General toxicology studies in rat and dog up to 9 months did not identify any specific target organs of 
ledipasvir toxicity but there were some indications of a potential for test-article related unwanted effects 
on the liver. The high doses employed corresponded to systemic exposure levels approximately 7-fold 
expected clinical levels. Ledipasvir had no significant genotoxic potential in standard test in vitro and in 
vivo. Carcinogenicity studies in rat and transgenic mouse are ongoing. Reproduction toxicity studies with 
ledipasvir showed some slight effects on fertility parameters in females and increases in skeletal 
variations in rat embryo-foetal studies, likely related to maternal toxicity and considered non-adverse. 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
No specific studies with the fixed combination with respect to potential toxic interactions have been 
conducted.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Sofosbuvir 
The review of non-clinical data available for sofosbuvir overall indicates that the compound has been 
adequately characterised. Gastrointestinal tract, liver and the haematological system were identified as 
target organs for toxicity. In some studies, the margin to clinical exposure was low at the NOAEL, 
however, overall available data do not indicate any major issues of clinical concern. 
Ledipasvir  
The non-clinical study programme for ledipasvir is rather limited and did not provide identification of any 
specific target organ toxicity was identified. Margins to clinical exposure were not very high, however, as 
maximum feasible oral doses have been used the non-clinical data submitted are considered adequate 
and no further studies are required.  
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
No studies on general toxicology with the fixed dose combination were conducted. This is acceptable 
based on the non-clinical data for the individual compounds alone, indicating that the potential for 
overlapping toxicities would not be clinically significant.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The SOF component of the FDC with SOF/LDV has been approved for use in combination with other agents 
for  the  treatment  of  chronic  HCV  infection  in  adults  in  the  EU  (16  January  2014).  However,  the  LDV 
component  is  a  novel  compound  designed  to  inhibit  HCV  RNA  replication  and  virion  production  by 
targeting the HCV NS5A protein. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 30/80 
  
  
According to the approval of SOF, a wealth of PK information on SOF is available. Hence, PK properties can 
be considered as well characterised. Consequently, this section will predominantly focus on specific and 
relevant PK aspects on LDV and on the combination SOF/LDV. 
Clinical pharmacology studies 
To support this application, a program of phase 1 clinical studies characterized the PK of SOF, LDV, and 
SOF/LDV. Additionally, intensive and/or sparse plasma concentration data from 391 healthy subjects and 
2147  HCV-infected  subjects  who  received  SOF/LDV,  SOF+LDV,  or  LDV  single  agent  from  14  clinical 
studies (9 Phase 1, 2 Phase 2, and 3 Phase 3 studies) were used for population PK evaluations of SOF, its 
predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007, and LDV. 
SOF single agent: There were 18 clinical pharmacology studies conducted with SOF and/or GS-9851 (as 
monotherapy or in combination with Peg-IFN and/or RBV). Those have already been presented in the 
Sofosbuvir single agent MAA dossier. 
LDV single agent: There were 19 clinical pharmacology studies conducted with LDV single agent 
submitted pertaining to the clinical pharmacology package (Table 1). 
SOF/LDV FDC: There were 10 clinical pharmacology studies conducted with SOF/LDV informing on the 
clinical pharmacology in Table 2 (phase II studies is given in Table 20 and phase III studies in Table 6). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The bioanalytical methods for the measurement of total LDV, SOF, GS-566500, and GS-331007 
concentrations in human plasma and urine were based on deuterium labelled internal standards and 
LC/MS/MS with positive ionization. The sample preparation for LDV was liquid-liquid extraction and for 
SOF and metabolites sample preparation involved protein precipitation extraction. All methods were 
validated. 
SOF and the new chemical entity LDV have respectively six stereo-centers, but the product is pure 
enantiomers. Interconversion between sofosbuvir and its diastereomer GS-491241 has not been 
observed, neither in vitro nor in vivo in preclinical species. The active metabolite GS-461203 has not been 
measured in vivo. Efficacy, in terms of rapid viral response, has been shown to correlate with exposure to 
sofosbuvir as well as GS-331007. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 34/80 
  
  
Formulations  
Administration of SOF/LDV FDC or SOF and LDV as individual components results in similar systemic 
exposures of SOF, GS-566500, GS-331007, and LDV. All phase III studies and a majority of the DDI 
studies were performed with the commercial formulation SOF/LDV (400 mg/90 mg) FDC tablet, i.e. no 
bioequivalence study is needed. 
Absorption 
Ledipasvir 
Ledipasvir was relatively rapidly absorbed with a tmax of 4 h after administration of the SOF/LDV FDC 
tablet in healthy volunteers. The solubility is low and pH dependent (<1 µM at pH >3). LDV is a BRCP and 
P-gp substrate. The absolute bioavailability of LDV has not been determined in humans. However, the oral 
bioavailability of LDV is expected to be ≤ 30%. 
Sofosbuvir 
For sofosbuvir, following a single dose of the SOF/LDV FDC tablet in fasted state, the PK profile of SOF 
show rapid turnover with a t max  
of 0.8 h and a short half-life of approximately 0.5 h. Tmax of GS-331007 
was observed at 3.5 h post-dose. The bioavailability of drug related material is moderate to high, at least 
50%, although the absolute value is unknown. 
In vitro studies show that SOF is subject to marked efflux, probably mediated by P-gp and/or BCRP. 
Co-administration of a single dose of 600 mg Cyclosporin A (CsA) increased the exposure to sofosbuvir 
4.5 fold providing further evidence of sofosbuvir being a sensitive substrate to efflux transporters. 
Food effect SOF/LDV 
The effect of food on PK after a single-dose of SOF/LDV FDC tablet was investigated in healthy volunteers. 
Administration with food increased AUC of SOF by 95% and 79% and Cmax 26% and 15%, after a 
moderate and high fat meal respectively. Corresponding figures for GS-331017 was an increase of 17% 
and 12% (AUC), and 18% increase and 30% decrease (Cmax). Similar plasma exposure was achieved for 
LDV upon administration of SOF/LDV under fasted or fed conditions (within ±15%). In clinical phase III, 
SOF/LDV has been administered without regard to food. It is supported that SOF/LDV can be 
administered without regard to food. 
Distribution  
Ledipasvir is highly protein bound in plasma. In vivo, the mean unbound LDV was approximately 0.2%, in 
healthy volunteers and subjects with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The mean whole 
blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.51 to 0.66. 
Plasma protein binding of SOF (the fraction unbound is 18%) seems to be independent of concentration 
and no effect of renal impairment was seen on degree of binding. GS-331007 is minimally bound to

Metabolism 
Ledipasvir 
LDV is metabolically stable in incubations in human microsomes and hepatocytes. Ledipasvir was also the 
major compound found in faeces accounting for on average 70% of the administered dose (84% of total 
in feaces), followed by the proposed oxidative metabolite M19 (Oxy-LDV-3, 2.2% of dose). This indicates 
that metabolism is not important in the elimination of LDV.

Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine and in the liver. The active 
metabolite GS-461203 is formed through several metabolic steps (Figure 1). In vitro, SOF is rapidly 
hydrolysed by CatA and CES1 to form GS-566500 which is further metabolised to eventually form the 
active triphosphate nucleoside analogue GS-461203. Involvement of CYP enzymes in the metabolism of 
sofosbuvir cannot currently be ruled out.  
In plasma, GS-331007 constituted the majority (90%) of measured radioactivity. In the mass balance 
study the intermediate metabolite GS-566500 had a t max of 1 h and a half-life of 2 h. The major 
metabolite GS-331007 peaked at 2 h and had a half-life of 26 h.

Elimination  
Excretion 
Ledipasvir 
In the human mass balance study the mean (SD) cumulative urinary and fecal recovery of 
[14C]-radioactivity was 87% (7.8%) with relative recovery of 1.2% (0.08%) in urine and 86% (7.8%) in 
faeces. Ledipasvir was the major compound found in faeces accounting for on average 70% of the 
administered dose. No unchanged parent drug was detected in the urine. LDV is not a substrate for 
hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1. 
Sofosbuvir 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater than 
92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired air, 
respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% 
was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for 
GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The transporters involved are unknown. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
LDV appears to be dose proportional within the range investigated (3-100 mg) and thus also at 
therapeutic exposure. Based on PopPK analysis of pooled single agent LDV no time dependency was

observed. For SOF no indication of non-linearity was observed in the range 200-1200 mg. There was no 
evidence of time-dependent PK for SOF over a 7 day period.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability for the PK of ledipasvir was 47.6% for CL, 56% for Vc, 78% for Vp and 45.9% 
for Ka, respectively. For the QD regimen of SOF/LDV FDC, model predicted steady state AUC was 6888 
ng·hr/mL for a typical HCV-infected subject (treatment naïve, male, 80 kg in weight and without RBV 
usage). The model predicted 5 to 95%tile AUC values of the population were 3181 ng·hr/mL to 18722 
ng·hr/mL, which is -54% to 172% difference from the typical value, respectively. A majority of the PK 
variability of LDV was unexplained by the model. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Ledipasvir 
The exposure of LDV after dosing once daily of SOF/LDV (400 mg/90 mg) in the patient population was 
predicted by PopPK analysis and the resulting AUCtau was (mean (CV%)) 8530 (61) and Cmax 364 (51), 
respectively. Based on the population PK analysis, CL/F and half-life for LDV in patients (for a typical 
HCV-infected subject treatment naïve, male, 80 kg body weight and without RBV usage) was determined 
to be approximately 13 L/h and 23 h, respectively. The CL/F and median half-life with rich PK sampling in 
healthy volunteers receiving SOF/LDV FDC was 14 L/h and 40 h, respectively. 
Sofosbuvir 
Population PK analyses of GS-331007 and SOF were performed using all available intensive and sparse PK 
samples collected in Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in healthy and HCV-infected subjects. In the sofosbuvir 
Population PK model, apparent oral clearance after administration of the dose (CL/F) was approximately 
30% lower in patients compared to healthy volunteers. In the GS-331007 Population PK model, the 
different HCV genotypes were associated with 50% to 60% higher CL/F as compared to healthy 
volunteers. The differing effect of patient status has not been explained. The population PK models can 
currently only be used for description of the observed data and not for predictions. 
Special Populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Ledipasvir 
Single dose PK of LDV was investigated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (HI, 
Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score ≥10 at screening). A single oral dose of 90 mg LDV was administered 
with a moderate fat meal. Mean (CV%) AUC(0-inf) was 9567 (68) ng*h/mL and 7616(31) ng*h/mL in 
severe HI subjects and healthy controls, respectively. Ledipasvir Cmax was approximately 35% lower and 
terminal t1/2 was prolonged (median 84 h vs. 46 h) in subjects with severe HI. The geometric mean ratio 
(90% CI) of AUC(0-inf) (severe HI/normal controls) was 108 (70 to 165). The unbound plasma exposure 
was similar in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and control subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Sofosbuvir 
Exposure to SOF and GS-566500 increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate (median 
Child-Pugh score of 8) and severe (median Child-Pugh score of 10) hepatic impairment. The exposure to 
GS-331007 was essentially unchanged. Of note, the viral response was numerically lower in patients with 
hepatic impairment compared to historical controls.

EMA/702742/2014

Renal impairment 
Ledipasvir 
The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir was studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in HCV negative 
subjects with severe renal impairment median [range] calculated CLCr 22 [17 to 29] mL/min). No 
clinically relevant differences in ledipasvir pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and 
subjects with severe renal impairment. The unbound plasma exposure was similar in subjects with severe 
renal impairment and control subjects with normal renal function. 
Sofosbuvir 
Severe renal impairment led to a more than 7-fold increase in exposure to GS-331007 while mild and 
moderate renal impairment increased GS-331007 exposure less than 2-fold. Exposure to SOF and 
GS-566500 was increased approximately 3-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment. Safety margins 
calculated from results of toxicology studies are 5.4 to 11.6 for SOF and 1.6 to 3.5 for GS-331007 in 
subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment. The haemodialysis extraction ratio for GS-331007 
was approximately 50%. Treatment of patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) is not recommended. 
Age, sex, race, body weight 
Female subjects had a significant lower CL of LDV than male subjects, resulting in higher exposure. No 
apparent relation has been observed between adverse events and exposure. The increased exposure in 
women is therefore not considered clinically relevant. The Population PK analyses of SOF and GS-331007 
did not suggest a significant effect of gender on the kinetics of either compound. 
The Population PK analyses of SOF, GS-331007 and LDV did not suggest a significant effect of race 
(described as White, Black, Asian and Other) on the kinetics of either compound. No dose adjustment of 
SOF/LDV combination is needed respective to race. 
Baseline body weight was identified as a statistically significant covariate on the PK of LDV. CL and Vc 
values increase in heavier subjects. Simulated steady state AUC of the subjects at the heaviest quartile 
(90 kg to 163 kg) was 5990 (2860 13500, 5-95%tile) ng.hr/mL, which is 45% lower than those at the 
lowest quartile (42 kg to 67 kg). Although the exposure to LDV decreases with increasing body weight, 
the effect is not considered clinically relevant. Body weight did not have a clinically significant effect on 
SOF exposure according to a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
No  formal  PK  study  in  elderly  patients  has  been  conducted.  The  impact  of  age  on  the  PK  of  SOF, 
GS-331007, and LDV has been evaluated as a covariate in the population PK analyses. The reporting of 
the PK population data doses not allow a clear evaluation of PK in elderly (>75 years). 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  SOF/LDV  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  <18  years  have  not  yet  been 
established. The SOF/LDV FDC is not indicated in patients under 18 years. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Co-administration of ledipasvir has an effect on exposure of sofosbuvir (approx. 2-fold increase). This is 
likely due to the inhibitory effects of LDV on P-gp and/or BCRP, for which SOF is a substrate. Exposure of 
metabolite GS-566500 was also increased nearly 2-fold, while GS-331007 was in general unaffected. 
There was no relevant change of LDV steady state PK parameters when co-administrated with single dose 
SOF at fasting state. 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir and SOF/LDV  
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 38/80 
  
  
Metabolism is not important in the elimination of LDV. LDV is a P-gp and BCRP substrate and in vitro data 
shows that LDV is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1. The elimination of LDV is not fully 
understood, e.g. whether other hepatic uptake transporters than those investigated are involved. 
In vivo the inducer rifampicin caused a decrease in LDV exposure (AUC -60% and Cmax -35%). 
Co-administration with EFV/FTC/TDF also resulted in a decrease of LDV exposure (-33% both AUC and 
Cmax). In both cases the decrease is most likely mediated by the inductive effects of efavirenz and 
rifampicin on drug transporters e.g. P-gp. 
The “boosters” ritonavir and COBI seem to have an effect on the exposure of LDV. In the combination with 
DRV/r (+40%), ATZ/r (2-fold) and EVG/COBI (+60-80%) increases were observed. Darunavir and 
atazanavir are also BCRP and/or P-gp inhibitors, contributing to the observed effect on LDV exposure. 
The solubility of LDV is low and decreases with increasing pH. Therefore, medical products that increase 
gastric pH are expected to decrease plasma concentration of LDV. The Applicant has submitted three 
studies with omeprazole 20 mg (SOF/LDV FDC was used in one study). In the two studies with LDV as 
single agent, LDV was dosed staggered 2 h after OMZ and a reduction of LDV exposure of 40-50% was 
observed. Dosing the SOF/LDV FDC simultaneously with OMZ (≥5 days dosing) did not have an effect on 
LDV exposure. 
Effects of ledipasvir and SOF/LDV on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
The inhibition data for ledipasvir showed no effect on CYP1A2, 2B6 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6. However, for 
CYP3A4, UGT1A1, P-gp and BCRP there were signals of in vitro inhibition at the estimated intestinal 
concentration and a risk of clinically relevant intestinal DDI cannot be excluded. Also, based on in vitro 
data a clinically relevant DDI via induction of PXR at intestinal level cannot be excluded. Ledipasvir was 
not in vitro an inhibitor of BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MRP2 or MRP4 
at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Ledipasvir has no effect on oral contraceptives as determined by both PK and PD measures. 
Pravastatin AUC and Cmax increased approximately 3-fold when co-administrated with LDV/VDV/TGV. 
Rosuvastatin AUC increased 8-9-fold and Cmax approximately 18-fold. The increase in rosuvastatin 
exposure is likely mediated by the inhibition of several uptake or efflux transporters of rosuvastatin (i.e. 
OATPs and BCRP). However, it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of the individual compounds 
(LDV, VDV or TGV) to the observed increase since it was administered as a mixture. 
SOF/LDV FDC has been studied in several combinations of antiretroviral agents (EFV/FTC/TDF, 
FTC/RPV/TDF, DRV/r, RAL, RPV, ABC/3TC, ATV/r, EVG/COBI). SOF/LDV seems to have an effect on 
exposure of COBI. The increase of exposure of COBI was prominent at Cmin (+325%) and less for AUC 
(+59%). In the same combination LDV exposure is increased 60-80%. The mechanism for this is 
unknown. 
Tenofovir data from DDI studies with SOF/LDV, showed that tenofovir exposure was increased 2-fold 
when simultaneously co-administered with EFV/FTC/TDF, and 1.5-fold with FTC/RPV/TDF, 
ATV/r+FTC/TDF or DRV/r+FTC/TDF, respectively. 
Sofosbuvir 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir  
Renal secretion is involved in the elimination of GS-566500 and GS-331007. The transporter(s) involved 
are unknown. It is also unknown whether hepatic transporters are involved in the uptake of the polar SOF 
and its metabolites into the hepatocytes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 39/80 
  
  
A 600 mg single dose of CsA had a large effect on SOF exposure with a 4.5-fold increase. However, the 
exposure to GS-331007 was not statistically different. Tacrolimus did not affect exposure to SOF or its 
metabolites. Darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg daily [QD]) increased exposure to SOF (34% increase) and 
to GS-566500 (80% increase), but not exposure to GS-331007. 
In vitro data indicate P-gp involvement in the absorption. Inducible enzymes may be involved in the 
elimination. The effect of strong P-gp inducers on SOF exposure has not been studied in vivo. Due to the 
risk of under-exposure, a warning has been included in the SmPC and concomitant use of strong P-gp 
inducers is not recommended. 
Effects of sofosbuvir on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
Sofosbuvir and its metabolite, GS-331007 did not show detectable inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6, or of CYP3A except for sofosbuvir which inhibited CYP3A4 by 22% 
concentration of 50 μM with midazolam as substrate. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 show low or no 
significant inhibition of UGT1A1. 
Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 was observed in vitro. An in vivo DDI study with oral contraceptives 
co-administered with sofosbuvir for 7 days did not show any sign of reduced exposure. The study is 
considered to be too short to fully exclude a minor induction. However, a clinically relevant effect is not 
expected based on the observed data.  
Sofosbuvir showed no inhibition of P-gp up to the highest concentration tested (300 μM) covering the 
calculated intestine concentration of sofosbuvir. GS-331007 is not a substrate or inhibitor for OAT1. 
DDI studies have been performed in healthy volunteers and patients to evaluate effect of SOF on the PK 
of antiretroviral agents (ARVs), methadone, CsA and tacrolimus. Further, the effect of these medications 
on the PK of SOF and its metabolites has been evaluated. Generally, SOF had no or limited effect on the 
PK of co-administrated ARVs; only for raltegravir AUC was decreased by 27%. Methadone exposure was 
unaffected by SOF as were exposures to CsA and tacrolimus, although C max for tacrolimus was decreased 
by almost 30%. 
Potential interactions with telaprevir or boceprevir have not been studied. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacokinetic properties of ledispasvir and sofosbuvir have been sufficiently characterized. 
Bioavailability and Elimination of LDV 
The absorbed fraction of LDV is ≥ 30% (mass balance study) while the oral bioavailability of LDV in the 
FDC formulation is expected to be ≤ 30%. The 86% of radioactive dose recovered in the faeces represents 
unabsorbed drug as well as drug eliminated by biliary excretion as either unchanged parent or 
metabolites. 
The hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/3 and OCT1 have been investigated and LDV was found not to 
be a substrate of these. The Applicant states that the uptake into hepatocytes could be mediated by 
passive diffusion. No data was presented to support this, i.e. full understanding of the elimination process 
remains unclear. 
Drug- drug interactions 
There were in vitro signals for both inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 and a clinical relevant drug-drug 
interaction at intestinal level cannot be excluded based on these data. The applicant has performed a 
study investigating the mechanism based inhibition (MBI) of Ledipasvir on all relevant CYPs. No MBI was 
revealed, however the concentration investigated did not cover intestinal levels which is relevant for 
Assessment report

CYP3A4. A study will be conducted to measure the unbound fraction in microsomes (Fu,mic) and the 
nominal test concentration (ie, nonspecific binding). The study will be completed by the end of 4Q 2014 
and the final study report will be submitted in 1Q 2015. 
The effect of LDV/VDV/TGV on the exposure of rosuvastatin was large. Rosuvastatin AUC increased 
8-9-fold and Cmax ca. 18-fold in, likely due to the inhibition of several uptake or efflux transporters (i.e. 
OATPs and BCRP). However, it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of the individual compounds 
(LDV, VDV or TGV) to the observed increase since it was administered as a mixture. Based on this 
information rosuvastatin is contraindicated and this is adequately reflected in the SmPC. The applicant is 
recommended to perform a new DDI study with the LDV/SOF FDC formulation.  
The combination of SOF/LDV with several HIV regimens containing tenofovir was questioned for reasons 
of renal safety. The concentration of tenofovir which carries an exposure dependent risk for renal tubular 
toxicity is substantially increased when SOF/LDV is given in combination with various tenofovir-containing 
regimens (tenofovir exposure was increased 2-fold when SOF/LDV was simultaneously co-administered 
with TDF/FTC/EFV, and 1.5-fold with TDF/FTC/RPV). The applicant provided new data in this regard.The 
cautionary use for combination of LDV/SOF with tenofovir containing regimens is reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology data for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir FDC is considered acceptable by the CHMP. All 
the concerns emerged during the evaluation were adequeately addressed.  
2.4.5.  Pharmacodynamics 
In this section data on LDV as single agent is presented. In vitro data, including resistance selection 
experiments, are discussed. Results obtained during 3 days of monotherapy (LDV given in various doses) 
in genotype-1 infection are also presented in here, including short term activity in vivo and NS5A 
resistance selected during those 3 days. LDV monotherapy is not further discussed in the efficacy section. 
A short summary of NS5A resistance selected in the phase 3 study is presented in this section (for more 
details refer to the efficacy section). 
The pharmacodynamics of SOF as a single agent is well established. This agent (a nucleotide 
HCV-polymerase inhibitor) has potent activity against all HCV-genotypes. Only one mutation of relevance 
for SOF resistance (S282T) has been found during in vitro studies. This mutation has been detected at a 
very low frequency in patients who failed a SOF-containing regimen through relapse, and in these cases 
the virus reverted back to wild type virus within short (i.e. viral fitness much hampered by this 
substitution). S282T has not been seen as a naturally occurring polymorphism. There is no cross 
resistance between NS5A inhibitors and SOF. SOF has been shown to retain its efficacy on retreatment.

Mechanism of Action and in vitro activity (LDV) 
While enzymatic assays are not available as NS5A lack a known enzymatic function, LDV has been shown 
to select for mutations within the NS5A gene in the replicon system conferring a reduction in viral 
susceptibility. Furthermore, replicons with resistance mutations associated with other NS5A inhibitors are 
cross resistant to LDV.  
It was shown that LDV lacks activity against NS3/4A protease, NS3 helicase, NS5B polymerase, the HCV 
internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and a broad panel of kinases.  
The mean EC50 values for genotype 1a and 1b was 0.03 and 0.004, respectively. Since LDV is highly 
protein bound, EC50-values were around 10 times higher when adding 40% human serum to cell based 
assays. The in vitro activity to non-1 subtypes are lower, and variable (Table 3).

It is noted that the EC50 value for GT3 is much higher than that for GT1. Still, clinical data do indicate that 
LDV adds relevant activity also for this genotype (see efficacy section). The issues concerning traditional 
in vitro/in vivo correlation as regards the relation between replicon EC50 and anticipated unbound plasma 
exposure has previously been noted by the CHMP. NS5A is a polyfunctional protein involved both in the 
replication complex as well as in viral assembly. In general, it is not clear whether replicon assays fully 
represent the impact of NS5A inhibitors on the HCV life cycle, as there is no viral assembly and release 
(see e.g., McGivern et al, Gastroenterology 2014). 
In GT-2 infection the frequency of NS5A RAVs occurring as natural polymorphisms is very high (with 
consequent substantial effects on LDV susceptibility). The role of SOF/LDV for this subtype would need to 
be justified on the basis of clinical studies, such studies have not been performed. 
In vitro resistance selections in replicon cells yielded the primary NS5A substitution Y93H in both 
genotype 1a and 1b. Additionally, a Q30E substitution emerged in genotype 1a replicons.  
In studies with site-directed mutagenesis (SDM,  evaluating activity after the introduction of known NS5A 
mutations, vs the activity seen with WT virus) LDV showed reduced activity (FC>10) against HCV

replicons encoding a number of mutations: K24G/N, M28T/A/G, Q30E/G/H/K/R, L31M/V/I, P32L, S38F, 
H58D, A92T, and Y93C/H/N/S in genotype 1a; and L31V/I, P58D, A92K and Y93H in genotype 1b.  
Both selection experiments and SDM studies show that the intrinsic resistance barrier of LDV is slightly 
lower for GT1a than for GT1b. 
GS-US-256-0102 - LDV monotherapy 
Viral decay  
This was a 3-day monotherapy study in previously untreated non-cirrhotic patients with GT 
1a/1b-infection.  
Multiple doses of LDV (1, 3, 10, 30 or 90 mg qd) or placebo for 3 consecutive days were given to patients 
with GT1a-infection (12 per cohort). Patients with genotype 1b were given 10 mg qd or placebo. 
Treatment was given fasted.  
The greatest median reductions from baseline in HVC RNA were generally observed on Day 2 (36 hours). 
For genotype 1a (several doses) the response was modestly dose dependent up to 30 mg (for max 
reduction values, 36 hrs).

In monotherapy maximal short term activity is seen at a dose of 30 mg and above (GT-1 infection). In 
combination with SOF only the highest dose (90 mg) has been studied. To be noted, the LDV exposure in 
this monotherapy study was considerable lower than the LDV exposure seen in the phase 3 program (SOF 
400 mg/LDV 90 mg; AUC t au around 8500 ng·h/mL). 
Resistance selection during monotherapy  
All patients dosed LDV ≥ 3 mg/day had RAMs detected at follow-up (day 4 and day 14). Mutations 
selected (detected by population sequencing) are shown below. The same primary NS5A resistance 
mutations were selected here, as discussed above (28, 30, 31, and 93), and the same patterns were seen 
in isolates from patients who relapsed in the phase 3 studies. 
The fold shift in EC50 to LDV by type of mutation varied extensively, but was generally lower for M28T and 
the highest for Y93H, Q30H being in between. The fact that M28T and Q30H were only detected in the 
groups treated with doses up to 10 mg but not detected in patients treated with 30-90 mg, is consistent 
with suppression of lower-level resistance variants at higher doses. Conversely, the highest-level 
resistant variants among subjects with genotype 1a virus (Y93C and Y93H) were selected more frequently 
in subjects who received 90 mg. All 10 subjects with genotype 1b HCV, who received 10 mg, harbored

Y93H following treatment, consistent with Y93H being the primary LDV RAM selected in the genotype 1b 
replicon.

Virus from all patients in the phase 3 studies were analyzed for baseline NS5A RAVs. With the use of deep 
sequencing with a sensitivity cut-off at 1% of the circulating viral population, such RAVs were seen in 
around in 15% of the patients (i.e. naturally occurring) in varying proportions from very low (some few 
percent of the viral populations) to very high (dominating the viral population). In the efficacy section the 
impact of such naturally occurring NS5A RAVs on treatment outcomes is further discussed. 
The totality of available evidence indicates that there is little reversion to wildtype after the selection of 
NS5A-inhibitor resistant variants.  
Preliminary data provided on re-treatment with SOF/LDV (+ RBV) is discussed in the efficacy section. 
Resistance selected in the phase 3 program (SOF/LDV +/- RBV) 
NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in post-baseline isolates from 29/37 patients 
not achieving sustained virological response (SVR). Of the 29 genotype 1a patients who qualified for 
resistance testing, 22/29 (76%) patients harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions K24, M28, Q30, 
L31, S38 and Y93 at failure, while the remaining 7/29 patients had no NS5A RAVs detected at failure.  The 
most common variants were Q30R, Y93H and L31M.  Of the 8 genotype 1b patients who qualified for 
resistance testing, 7/8 (88%) harboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions L31 and Y93 at failure, while 
1/8 patients had no NS5A RAVs at failure. The most common variant was Y93H. Ledipasvir is thus 
anticipated to be cross-resistant to other NS5A inhibitors approved or in late development. 
There was no apparent selection of resistance in patients with genotype 3 infection relapsing after 
SOF/DV therapy. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The main dose response study of LDV was described above (study GS-US-256-0102, monotherapy over 
3 days). As mentioned, for HCV GT1a, a modest dose response was seen up to a dose of 30 mg and above 
(90 mg). The exposure (AUCtau) of LDV in this study was around 1600 and 3800 h·ng/mL for the 30 and 
90 mg dose, respectively. 
LDV in different doses (30 or 90 mg qd) was also studied in a phase 2 study (GS-US-0120). This study was 
initiated prior to the acquisition SOF by the applicant. Here LDV was combined with other non-approved 
agents, tegobuvir (TGV, a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor) + vedroprevir (VDV, an NS3-inhibitor) plus 
ribavirin. In this combination the LDV exposure (AUC tau) was around 1700 and 5900 h·ng/mL, 
respectively. In that regimen (not further studied) the 90 mg dose yielded a clearly higher SVR rate than 
did the 30 mg dose (where both viral breakthrough and relapses were frequent). 
As mentioned LDV AUCtau was around 8500 h·ng/mL in the phase 3 studies (pop-PK).

2.4.6.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of SOF has been well characterized and has been presented during the approval 
procedure for sofosbuvir (SOF as single agent). In summary, SOF has a pangenotypic activity, and has a 
very high barrier to resistance. There seems to be only one key mutation (S282T) that has relevant 
effects on susceptibility, and confers partial resistance to SOF. However, that mutation has a profound 
effect on viral fitness, and mutant virus was shown to rapidly revert back to WT virus when drug pressure 
ceases. SOF can therefore be used in re-treatment of patients who failed sofosbuvir-containing 
treatment. 
LDV is highly potent in vitro, with pico- to low nanomolar EC50s against genotype 1a and-b. Resistance 
selection for GT-1 has been characterised in vitro, with mutations at Y93 as a key mutation (FC>1000) for 
both GT 1a and 1b, and for GT1a also mutations at Q30. The in vitro activity is high also for GT 4a and -d. 
EC50 values for GT 2a are highly dependent on the presence or absence of a prevalent polymorphism at 
L31. In vitro data per se does not justify the use of SOF/LDV for the treatment of genotype-2 infection and 
clinical data is lacking. 
The in vitro susceptibility of genotype 3 is markedly lower (EC50 168 nM). However, clinical data (refer to 
efficacy section) indicate that LDV still adds relevant activity also for this genotype. 
LDV given as monotherapy for 3 days to patients with GT 1a and 1b yielded a 3 log10 reduction in 
HCV-RNA. In monotherapy in genotype 1a infection, maximal short term activity is seen at a dose of 30 
mg and above. In combination with SOF only 90mg, the highest dose of LDV tested, has been studied. To 
be noted, the LDV exposure in this monotherapy study was considerable lower than the LDV exposure 
seen in the phase 3 program. The selected dose is anticipated to yield maximal activity against genotype 
1; however, the exposure reduction at which activity declines against partially resistant variants is 
unknown. There has been no dose ranging against any other genotype; a similar dose as for GT1 has been 
used for GT3 and GT4. 
Resistance mutations were selected in all patients in the monotherapy study; LDV has a low barrier to 
resistance which is typical for the class. The pattern, which is similar to that of other agents in this class, 
was dose dependent in patients with genotype 1a. 
Published data on long term follow-up after failure with other NS5A inhibitors indicate that NS5A resistant 
variants persist. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The main studies that provide the evidence for efficacy of SOF/LDV against genotype 1 chroninc HCV 
infection are the ION-1, 2 and 3 studies. 
ION-1 and -3 concerns previously untreated patients, while ION-2 included those who had failed therapy 
with peg+IFN or peg+IFN+ boceprevir/telaprevir (HCV protease inhibitors). Up to 20% of cirrhotic 
patients were allowed in ION-1 and ION-2, while ION-3 only included non-cirrhotic patients.

Data from ELECTRON 2 study (proof-of-concept study with decompensated liver disease 
[Child-Pugh-Turcotte-B]) and from the SOLAR-1 study which investigate the efficacy of LDV/SOF+RBV in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis and/or post transplantation were provided. Furthermore data of 
patients infected with genotype 3 from ELECTRON and ELECTRON -2 studies was provided as supporting 
evidence. Data on the treatment of HIV coinfected patients and patients with genotype 4 were also 
provided. These data considered of clinical relevance are discussed below. 
2.5.1.  Main studies 
Design aspects of the ION studies (genotype 1) 
In the phase 3 studies patients were stratified by genotype (1a, 1b, or mixed 1a/1b) and the presence of 
cirrhosis at screening (ION-1 and-2). All treatment was given open-label (including ribavirin).  
The primary objective was to determine the antiviral activity of combination treatment with SOF/LDV with 
and without RBV as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained virologic response 12 weeks 
after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12), which in practice is equivalent to cure. 
On-treatment HCV-RNA results were not blinded to the investigator, while post-treatment HCV-RNA 
levels were blinded to the investigator and the sponsor. 
Previously untreated patients (ION-1 and ION-3) 
ION-1 Study Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5885 Fixed-Dose Combination ± Ribavirin for 12 and 24 Weeks in 
Treatment-Naïve Subjects with Chronic Genotype 1 HCV Infection. 
ION-3 Study Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir Fixed-Dose Combination ± Ribavirin for 8 Weeks and 
Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir Fixed-Dose Combination for 12 Weeks in Treatment-Naïve Subjects with Chronic 
Genotype 1 HCV Infection. 
These studies included monoinfected patients (no HBV or HIV coinfection) with genotype 1 infection. 
Similar inclusion criteria applied, except with regards to compensated cirrhosis (allowed in ≤20% of 
patients in ION-1, not allowed in ION-3). 
Absence of cirrhosis was defined as any one of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
Liver biopsy within 2 years of screening showing absence of cirrhosis, or 
Fibroscan within 6 months with a result of ≤ 12.5 kPa, or 
FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and an APRI of ≤ 1 during screening 
The following biochemistry had to be met at screening: 
- 
ALT and AST  ≤ 10 ULN 
-  Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN 
- 
Platelets ≥ 50,000 
-  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 60 mL /min 
-  Hemoglobin ≥ 11/12 g/dL for females/males. 
- 
- 
Albumin ≥ 3g/dL 
INR ≤ 1.5  ULN

Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by genotype (1a or 1b; subjects with mixed genotype 1a/1b were stratified 
as 1a). In ION-1, subjects were stratified by the the presence or absence of cirrhosis at screening. 
Approximately 20% of the subjects enrolled may have had evidence of cirrhosis at screening in ION-1.  
Results 
The screening failure rate was 14% (N=145) in ION-1, primarily for laboratory values not being within 
specified ranges, clinically relevant drug abuse and HCV RNA being too low. That rate was higher, 22% for 
ION-3, for the same reasons and added to that, absence of cirrhosis not documented. 
Demographics were similar in ION-1 and ION3, except that 20% of patients had cirrhosis in ION-1. Races 
other than white (77-85%) or black (12-21%) were not well represented. Around 40% were females. 
Median age was 53 years (Q1, Q3 = 47 and 59). Genotype 1a was predominant, as expected in studies 
conducted in the US. Of note, the total number of TN cirrhotic treated with SOF/LDV for 12 weeks is very 
limited (n=34). Patients with baseline platelets count as low as 50.000/µL were eligible for the study. 
However, most of the cirrhotics in ION-1 had baseline platelets counts indicative of cirrhosis without 
significant portal hypertension.

The proportion of patients who discontinued therapy was very low (1.3% in the studies combined) and 
only occasional patients stopped therapy for reasons of AEs (3 out of total 1082). Loss to follow-up was 
infrequent. 
High response rates were seen across all treatment arms (Table 8). 
In ION-1 (12 weeks therapy) there was a very low relapse rate in both arms (without or with RBV). 
However, the number of cirrhotics treated for 12 weeks (34 with SOF/LDV, 33 with SOF/LDV + RBV) is too 
low to make definitive conclusions on the relative efficacy of 12 and 24 weeks of therapy for this group.

In ION-3 the excellent results with SOF/LDV for 12 weeks treatment in TN naïve patients without cirrhosis 
are confirmed (in large numbers). However, the relapse rate is clearly higher when the treatment 
duration is lowered to 8 weeks, regardless if adding RBV to the regimen.

The higher relapse rate in patients treated for 8 weeks was driven by male patients, those with IL28 
non-CC genotype and/or high baseline viral load, as shown in Table 9. All patients with a non-response for 
other reasons that relapse had undetectable HCV-RNA at time for leaving the study (if passed week 2). 
For the most it concerns patients who did not return for follow-up, but had finished the full treatment 
course with an end-of treatment response. Consequently, in order to compare the antiviral efficacy of 
treatment arms, relapse rates are the most sensitive measure.

Of interest, an even shorter duration of SOF/LDV (6 weeks) was tested in phase 2 (ELECTRON study, part 
6, group 18). This concerned treatment naïve patients with GT-1 infection, and without cirrhosis (i.e. 
same as in ION-3). The relapse rate was high, 8/25. 
Previously treated patients (ION-2) 
ION-2 Study Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5885 Fixed-Dose Combination ± Ribavirin for 12 and 24 Weeks in 
Treatment-Experienced Subjects with Chronic Genotype 1 HCV Infection. 
ION-2 included patients with prior failure to treatment with a Peg-IFN+RBV regimen, +/- boceprevir or 
telaprevir (NS3/4A inhibitors). Around half had failed therapy that included an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. 
The prior failure had to be due to insufficient virological efficacy (i.e. not AEs or other causes for 
discontinuation). Medical records sufficiently detailed to categorize prior non-response (non-response vs 
relapse/viral breakthrough) was requested. 
Cirrhosis was defined as described for ION-1 and 3, and the same baseline blood chemistry had to be 
fulfilled as in those studies.  
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by HCV genotype (1a or 1b; subjects with mixed genotype 1a/1b were 
stratified as 1a), the presence or absence of cirrhosis at screening, and response to prior HCV therapy 
(relapse/breakthrough or nonresponse) at screening. 
Results  
Of 550 screening, 110 subjects (20.0%) failed to be included, for reasons similar to those in the other 
studies.  
Dropout rates were low and violations were uncommon, 99.3% of patients completed study treatment. 
The main demographics were fairly identical to those shown for ION-1. As expected, the IL28B CC 
genotype (favourable predictor for outcomes with peg-IFN-based therapy) was seen in lower proportions.  
Of note, among cirrhotics, IL-28CC genotype was seen in 30% in ION-1 as compared to 9% in ION. The 
proportion of patients with cirrhosis was maximized in accordance with the protocol (20%) and was 
balanced between arms (stratification factor). Just like in ION-1, the baseline platelet count was 
indicative of uncomplicated compensated cirrhosis (i.e. no significant portal hypertension) in the majority 
of cirrhotic patients. Indeed, in two out of four arms, the median count was well within normal range 
(Table 10).

High SVR rates were observed across treatments groups (12 or 24 weeks, with and without added weight 
based ribavirin), as shown in Table 12. Relapse consisted of virological non-response in all patients but 
one (arm 4, virological breakthrough).  
Relapses, more frequent in the 12-week arms, occurred within week 4 after stopping therapy in 9/11 
cases.

An analysis of virological failure in ION-2

As evident, the strongest predictor of virological failure (i.e. relapse) was a shorter treatment duration (in 
practice all patients achieved SVR with the 24 week regimen, including the compensated cirrhotics). 
For the 12-week treatment groups 14 factors were analyzed by univariate logistic regression (RBV +/-, 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, GT 1a vs b, cirrhosis status, response to prior HCV therapy, prior HCV therapy, 
BL viral load, BMI, IL28B alleles, GGT-levels and platelets). Two were found significant as predictors of 
relapse: the presence of cirrhosis and having a baseline platelet count ≤125,000/mL (all patients with low 
platelets are anticipated to be cirrhotic). 
Relapse by baseline NS5A resistance 
Likewise as in ION-3 the outcomes by the presence or absence of baseline NS5a RAVs were studied.  
In ION-2 it is noted that, despite that these patients are selected for negative predictive factor for cure, 
the relapse rate with 12 weeks of therapy was zero for non-cirrhotic patients, in the absence of BL NS5A 
RAVs (with or without RBV). Although numbers are low, it is also noted that in non-cirrhotic with such BL 
RAV, there was no relapses with triple therapy including RBV.

a One subject in LDV/SOF treatment group did not achieve HCV RNA< LLOQ at the end of treatment (42 IU/mL) and is 
not included in relapse rate calculation. This subject did not have a baseline RAV but achieved SVR4, SVR12, and 
SVR24. 
In patients with cirrhosis the relapse rate was not nominally lowered by adding RBV (3/22 vs 4/22), and 
relapses occurred also in the absence of BL NS5A RAVs. However, data from the ELECTRON 2 and 
SOLAR-1 study in patients with decompensated liver disease support the incremental effect of RBV when 
treating patients with very advanced liver disease for 12 weeks. 
Tretament of patients with decompensated liver disease and/or 
post-transplantation 
Data from the expanding ELECTRON-2 study was recently presented (EASL conference 2014). SOF/LDV 
(without RBV) had been given for 12 weeks to patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B). The 
relapse rate was high (7/20). It is notable that RBV was not given in this study. 
For the larger SOLAR-1 study the conservative decision to give triple therapy including RBV to all patients 
was chosen. This study is conducted in patients with genotype 1 or -4 infection, decompensated liver 
disease and/or post transplantation. Subjects are treatment naive or treatment-experienced and have 
documentation of the presence or absence of cirrhosis.

Interim data has been provided by the applicant. Among patients with decompensated liver disease and 
no previous transplantation, the mean age was 57. 66% were male, 90% white. Approximately 70% had 
genotype 1a infection and only 3 patients had GT4. 20% of patients had the IL28B C/C genotype and 65% 
had received prior treatment. 26% of patients had a MELD score >15. 
Among cirrhotic patients post transplantation, the mean age was 60. The cohort was 85% male and 
predominantly white. 70% had GT1a infection and one patient had GT4. 19% had the IL28B C/C genotype 
and 78% had received prior treatment. 11% had a MELD score >15.

Thus, SVR12 data are immature. SVR4 data however, indicate that SOF/LDV + RBV (the latter initiated at 
a starting dose of 600 mg/day in patients with decompensated liver disease) for 12 or 24 weeks is 
effective also in patients with decompensated liver disease. SVR4 generally has approximately 90% 
predictive value of SVR12. In this small dataset, a somewhat higher proportion of relapses seem to occur 
between week 4-12 than is usual in patients with compensated liver disease. Further observation will 
clarify if this is a real phenomenon. 
Treatment of genotype 3  
The efficacy and safety of SOF/LDV with or without RBV for 12 weeks was studied under the ELECTRON 2 
protocol. Among 51 treatment naïve patients, 8 had cirrhosis. Results are shown in Table 15. Notably, as 
there was no control group receiving only SOF+RBV, the contribution of LDV to regimen efficacy needs to 
be assessed through cross study comparison with the phase III trials of SOF+RBV in genotype 3 (Table 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 53/80 
  
  
 
15). Further, while the efficacy of SOF monotherapy against GT3 is not well characterised, efficacy would 
be anticipated to be low.

During the evaluation, preliminary data from ELECTRON-2 were provided for another 50 patients with 
GT-3 infection, who were treatment experienced with (n=22) or without (n=28) cirrhosis. Also these 
patients were treated with SOF/LDV + RBV for 12 weeks, with SVR4 results as shown in Table 16. Of note, 
not all patients had reached week 8 at the time of analysis.

The patient with viral breaktrough was non-cirrhotic, had IL28B CC- genotype 3a –infection.  HCV-RNA 
was <LLOQ at week 4, and the week 10 visit was missing; lack of compliance is the suspected cause of 
failure. 
Of the subjects for whom posttreatment Week 8 and 12 data is available, one additional subject, with 
cirrhosis, relapsed at the posttreatment Week 8 time point; this is the only subject that has relapsed after 
having achieved SVR4.

Despite the fact that the GT3 in vitro susceptibility for LDV is considerably lower than that seen in GT1 
virus (see pharmacodynamics section), results in Electron-2 supports that LDV adds activity also in GT-3. 
A cure rate of 100%, including in 5/5 cirrhotic patients treated SOF/LDV + RBV for 12 weeks is considered 
informative, despite the low numbers. As regards a 64% SVR rate with only SOF/LDV, it also seems 
unlikely that this would be achieved with SOF alone for 12 weeks. However, the relapse rate in the TE 
cohort (Table 16), in particular those with cirrhosis (6/22 up to week 8 post treatment) also indicate that 
the triple regimen given for 12 weeks is not an optimized treatment duration, as difficult to cure patients 
will likely have a relatively high relapse rate. Of note, there are no data to compare the present 
interferon-free standard of SOF+RBV for 24 weeks with SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks, nor any data on the 
efficacy of SOF/LDV+RBV with 24 weeks of therapy. 
The applicant has presented data indicating that there was no selection of resistant variants to LDV in the 
patients that relapsed. This is in stark contrast to what is seen in GT1, and is indicative that the absolute 
antiviral potency and therefore selection pressure of LDV is lower in GT3, which would also be anticipated 
based on EC50 values. The applicant does not have any early viral kinetic data to support the additive 
effect of LDV in the regimen, as relevant samples are not available from the first week of therapy, where 
an effect could have been detected. Still, clinically relevant efficacy is considered likely (refer also to 
section on pharmacodynamics). 
Treatment of genotype 4 
The in vitro EC50 for LDV against GT4 (GT4a 0.39 nM, GT4d 0.6 nM) is intermediate between that 
recorded for GT1 (0.004-0.031 nM), where the bulk of clinical efficacy data are available, and GT3 (168 
nM) where data indicate that LDV does retain clinically relevant, albeit reduced, activity. Furthermore, 
SOF is equally effective against GT1 and GT4. 
Preliminary data are available from Group E of the NIAID/NIH collaborative Study CO-US-337-0117. In 
this group, 21 subjects with genotype 4 HCV infection (13 TN, 8 TE, total 6 with cirrhosis) are receiving 12 
weeks of LDV/SOF treatment. 15/15 with available data achieved SVR4 including 6 TE, of whom 3 have 
cirrhosis. SVR 12 was achieved for 5/5 with available data.. The study described is ongoing as well as 
other studies. 
Treatment of patients with HIV co-infection  
Patients with HIV co-infection respond similarly to therapy with direct acting antivirals as do those without 
HIV infection. Preliminary data from the NIAID-13-1-0159 study support this assertion. Here 
non-cirrhotic, co-infected patients with genotype 1 virus are treated with SOF/LDV for 12 weeks. Among 
patients for whom SVR12 are available 39/40 have reached this. Another 10/10 patients have achieved 
SVR4. 
Resistance in patients failing therapy in phase 3 
Resistance Analysis Population (RAP) 
Population and/or deep sequencing of NS5A was performed at baseline for all subjects enrolled in the 
phase 2b/3 studies. The RAP includes any patient who received at least one dose of a SOF/LDV-containing 
regimen, but did not achieve SVR12 due to virologic failure (on-treatment or relapse) or early 
discontinuation, had HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/ml and had a plasma sample available for analysis.  For the 
phase 3 studies, it concerns in practice the patients with relapse (n=36) as a cause of failure. Those with 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 55/80 
  
  
 
 
non-response for other causes had in practice always HCV-RNA below detection limit as their last sample 
in study, as clarified previously. 
Resistance analyses included NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing. Phenotypic analysis was attempted for 
the majority of cases and was successful for a subset of patients. 
Table 18 summarizes NS5A resistance (BL and failure) for the 36 patients with a relapse. The percentage 
given (%) shows the proportion of the viral population that carries the mutation (lower cut off 
value=1%). In summary NS5A resistance was generally seen in patients failing therapy (28/36, 78%). In 
the majority of such cases (19/28, 68%) there was a selection of resistance from none or low level (low 
proportion) at baseline, to a high resistance (high proportion, high FC) at time of failure. In the other 9 
cases FC was high already at baseline (with high proportions of mutations present in the baseline viral 
population.

The frequency of different mutations seen at time of failure is presented in the graph below. The pattern 
relates to subtype (1a vs 1b), where Y93 as a single mutation dominates for GT1b, while 1 or more LDVs 
were detected in the 1a isolates (mainly Y93, Q30, L31, and M28).

Prevalence of Specific NS5A RAVs Detected in Virologic Failure Subjects in the SOF/LDV 
Phase 3 Studies at Virologic Failure 
Data on reversion of selected NS5a resistance (i.e. during follow-up of patients who failed therapy in 
phase 3) was not presented, however the totality of data indicates that persistence is likely. 
The applicant has provided data on emergent resistance in 11 relapsed patients with genotype 3 infection. 
There wea no clear evidence of selection of resistance variants. This cannot be due toa higher barrier to 
resistance, but rather to lower activity and subsequently lower selection pressure. 
In contrast to the high frequency of NS5a resistance in patients failing therapy, there was a total lack of 
NS5B-resistance (i.e. resistance to SOF). This is in accordance with findings available at the time of 
approval of SOF (refer to section on pharmacodynamics). 
Preliminary retreatment data  
The applicant provided data for 20 patients with GT-1 infection who failed an initial SOF-containing 
regimen in the LONESTAR or ELECTRON studies. These patients were re-treated with SOF/LDV + RBV for 
12 weeks (n=19) or 24 weeks (n=1, a patient who had the S282T mutation detected at time of prior 
failure). All patients achieved SVR4-12. 
Of note, LDV had been part of prior therapy in only 9/20. Among these 9 patients, NS5A resistance at time 
of prior relapse was infrequent; in 5 no NS5A RAVs were seen, and among the other four patients only 
single mutations with limited impact on LDV susceptibility was seen in 3 out 4 patients and in varying 
proportions of viral loads as measured by deep sequencing. Only one patient had substantial NS5A 
resistance. This patient was re-treated for 24 weeks. This was a non-cirrhotic patient that may well have 
been cured by SOF+RBV alone. 
In summary, this data provides further evidence that SOF can be re-used without any evident loss of 
efficacy. This is re-assuring but also expected, taking the pharmacodynamics of SOF into account. 
However, available data does not provide compelling evidence for LDV being useful in the re-treatment of 
patients who failed an NS5A-containing regimen with class resistance.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main clinical data underlying this application are three phase III trials (ION-1, -2 and -3). In these, 
non-cirrhotic patients with genotype 1a or -1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV +/- RBV for 8, 12 or 
24 weeks. Furthermore, patients with compensated cirrhosis were treated with SOF/LDV +/- RBV for 12 
or 24 weeks. Supplementary studies of importance for the recommended use of SOF/LDV according to the 
SmPC cover the use of SOF/LDV +/- RBV in patients with genotype 1 infection and decompensated liver 
disease (SOLAR-1, ELECTRON 2), the use of SOF/LDV +/- RBV in patients with genotype 3 infection 
(ELECTRON 2) and the use of SOF/LDV in genotype 4 infection (GS-US-337-1119). 
All in all, the rationale for the study designs is understood and the trials appear to have been 
well-conducted. Data from some of the supporting studies are immature and mainly comprise SVR4 data. 
This, however, is not considered to preclude general conclusions. 
The main results in the phase 3 studies are summarized in the phase 3 outcome summary table.

The overall efficacy of SOF/LDV in the absence of ribavirin is excellent. No compelling evidence for 
additive effects of RBV in patients with compensated liver disease has emerged. The relapse rate in 
treatment naïve non-cirrhotic patients treated for 8 weeks was somewhat higher than in those treated for 
12 weeks. It is notable that treatment naïve non-cirrhotic patients that relapse will have likely effective 
retreatment options. Given a summary relapse rate of 0.5% (3/650) with 12 weeks of therapy in ION-1 
and -3, there was no indication that longer treatment duration than this would be of value in an 
unselected treatment naïve population with compensated liver disease. 
The ION-2 study included a substantial number of patients with prior failure on NS3/4A protease 
inhibitors in combination with pegIFN/RBV. As there is no cross resistance between any of these drugs 
and SOF/LDV, the ION-2 study population may be considered an enriched subset of patients with 
negative prognostic factors. Therefore, results are considered of relevance also for treatment naïve 
patients that are difficult to cure. Also in treatment experienced patients, the efficacy of SOF/LDV was 
excellent. However, relapse rates overall were higher with 12 weeks of therapy (5%, 11/220) compared 
to 24 weeks (0.5%, 1/220). This difference was driven by patients that either had detectable baseline 
variants with reduced susceptibility to LDV, or had cirrhosis. In the former category 12 weeks of therapy 
was associated with a 18% (6/34) risk of relapse, compared to 3% (5/184) among those without such 
baseline variants. For cirrhotics, 12 weeks of therapy was associated with a relapse rate of 16% (7/44), 
versus 0% (0/44) among those with the same condition treated for 24 weeks. It is recognized that the 
dataset is small and absolute differences uncertain. However, these data must be placed in a clinical

context. As opposed to the case for non-cirrhotic patients without prior exposure to direct acting antivirals 
who can readily be retreated, clinical harm may be incurred in those with cirrhosis and/or with prior 
exposure to NS3/4A protease inhibitors, in case of not reaching SVR. For cirrhotics, failure to achieve viral 
clearance may equal failure to prevent clinical disease progression. For patients with prior NS3/4A 
exposure, the efficacy of retreatment options is unclear, as it has not been shown that NS3/4A inhibitors 
retain efficacy in case of prior failure with selection of resistance to a drug of this class, and as failure of 
SOF/LDV is generally accompanied by selection of variants resistant to available NS5A inhibitors. 
Therefore, albeit the high efficacy shown with both 12 and 24 weeks of therapy, the difference in SVR 
rates with 12 weeks of therapy cannot be disregarded. The issue of recommended treatment durations is 
further discussed under the benefit-risk section. 
SOF has pangenotypic activity. However, for both genotype 2 and -3, the in vitro efficacy of LDV is 
considerably lower than for genotype 1. While no role is foreseen for LDV in the treatment of genotype 2 
infection, clinical data in genotype 3 are available from the ELECTRON 2 study. In a small sample of 
treatment naïve patients, some of whom had cirrhosis, 12 weeks of SOF/LDV therapy was associated with 
a 64% SVR rate (16/25) with the remaining patients relapsing. While not well characterized, it seems 
unlikely that SOF monotherapy for 12 weeks would have achieved a 64% response rate in 12 weeks of 
therapy for genotype 3. Furthermore, SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks yielded a 100% SVR rate (26/26) 
including five cirrhotics all reaching SVR. As the efficacy of SOF+RBV alone when used for 12 weeks in a 
treatment naïve genotype 3 population was around 60% in phase III trials, these data are also indicative 
that LDV has clinically relevant activity within a combination regimen for the treatment of genotype 3. 
However, as noted above, EC50 is substantially higher in GT3 compared to GT1 (168 nM versus 
0.004-0.031 nM). Further, there are no viral kinetic data to show a direct effect of LDV on genotype 3 
virus and there is no clear evidence of a selection pressure of LDV in genotype 3. Therefore, it is 
recognized that any conclusions that LDV has activity against genotype 3 rests on cross-study 
comparisons of the anticipated activity of the background regimens (SOF and SOF+RBV). On this basis, 
activity is anticipated that would be clinically relevant in patients for whom the present standard 
interferon-free regimen (SOF+RBV for 24 weeks) would be expected to yield inoptimal SVR rates based 
on available evidence (cirrhotics and/or treatment experienced patients). LDV might be added to such a 
regimen in order to increase antiviral drug pressure and presumably efficacy. It is recognized that there 
is no metric to quantify the presumed benefit of this. 
The in vitro activity of LDV against genotype 4 is 0.39-0.6 nM and thus higher than for GT1 but 
substantially lower than for GT3. The applicant has submitted data from a cohort of patients with GT4, 
including treatment experienced patients and a few patients with cirrhosis that have been treated with 
SOF/LDV for 12 weeks. While it is recognized that these data are immature, such results would be very 
unlikely with SOF alone, and are indicative of a substantial contribution of LDV to efficacy, which is 
anticipated to be high. The combination of in vitro data and available clinical outcomes are indicative that 
SOF/LDV for 12 weeks is an effective regimen for the treatment of GT4 infection. 
When SOF/LDV was used for 12 weeks without RBV in patients with genotype 1 infection and 
decompensated cirrhosis, the relapse rate was high (7/20). Interim data from the SOLAR-1 study, where 
patients are treated with SOF/LDV + RBV show SVR12 data of 87% (83/95) in patients treated for 12 
weeks. Only SVR4 data are available for 24 weeks and the potential increment in response with this 
treatment duration in decompensated patients cannot be clearly assessed presently. 
As anticipated based on previous data with direct acting antiviral treatment regimens, available data from 
the ERADICATE study are not indicative that HIV coinfection impacts response to SOF/LDV. 
The efficacy of LDV as part of a retreatment regimen in patients with prior virological failure and selection 
of resistance to NS5A inhibitors has not been demonstrated.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
SOF/LDV is a highly effective treatment regimen for genotype 1 infection. 8 weeks of therapy suffices in 
many treatment-naïve patients. In general, treatment for more than 12 weeks or the addition of ribavirin 
is not needed to increase efficacy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis and/or patients with reduced 
viral susceptibility to LDV at baseline, the relapse rate is higher with 12 weeks than with 24 weeks of 
therapy. The increment with an extra 12 weeks is not well characterised, and likely depends on a number 
of host and viral factors. For patients with decompensated liver disease, available data are indicative that 
RBV should be added to the regimen.  
SOF has genuine pangenotypic activity (similar against all genotypes). LDV likely has clinically relevant 
activity against GT3, albeit lower than against GT1. LDV has clinically relevant activity against GT4 virus. 
Factors to take into account when evaluating the incremental benefit of a marginal increase in SVR with 
prolonged therapy includes the risk of clinical disease progression in case of failure to clear virus, as well 
as available effective retreatment options in case of failure with selection of resistant variants. 
Recommendations on regimens in different populations are discussed in the benefit-risk section. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of SOF has been evaluated as part of the sofosbuvir single agent marketing authorization 
application. Tolerability is not clearly different from placebo, and no specific side effects have been 
attributed to SOF. The clinical safety of LDV has predominantly been studied in combination with SOF. To 
date, no particular side effects have been reported for NS5A-inhibitors. 
The safety of SOF/LDV generated from the phase 3 studies is summarized in Table 19. Exposure data 
from the phase 2 program is provided in Table 20. There are no studies from the phase 2 program where 
the exposure to SOF or LDV was higher than in phase III (as a consequence of higher dose or other 
regimens). 
In the phase 3 studies (total 1952 patients) a limited number were >65 years old (152, 8%), the median 
age was 55. Around 40% of patients were females.  Most patients were white (82%), and the remaining 
patients were predominantly black. 
A creatinine clearance <60 ml/min was an exclusion criterion. Around 70% had GFR>90.

A causative relationship to SOF/LDV in those patients who discontinued treatment was difficult to 
established. One case of Factor VIII inhibition was reported as related to study-drug. And the case of 
hemorrhage occurred during a biopsy procedure.

Adverse events 
Common AEs 
The frequency of AEs of grade >2 was low. The frequency of a number of common AEs were more 
frequent in those treated with the triple regimen including ribavirin, as expected. AEs seen in higher 
frequency with the triple regimen are those previously well described as RBV-associated. To elucidate any 
contribution of LDV to the side effect profile of SOF/LDV, Table 23 shows cross study comparison to 
studies performed as part of the SOF program.

When evaluating common adverse events seen in the phase 3 studies in various ways, the side effect 
profile of LDV/SOF seems rather similar to that that has been reported for placebo in similar HCV 
populations in other studies. To further describe the side effect profile of SOF/LDV versus placebo, the 
applicant submitted safety data from the double-blinded SIRIUS study, where patients were randomized 
to SOF/LDV (n=77) or to placebo (n=78) for 12 weeks and subsequently SOF/LDV. A comparison of side 
effects during the 12 weeks that are placebo controlled. 
The overall safety profile of SOF/LDV and placebo was very similar, with 84.4 and 83.3% of patients 
reporting any treatment emergent adverse event. The following adverse event, however, stand out as 
more common in the SOF/LDV group: Fatigue was reported in 16.9% of SOF/LDV treated patients versus 
3.8% of placebo patients (13 versus 3). Furthermore, headache was reported in 35.1% of patients 
treated with SOF/LDV versus 20.5% of those treated with placebo (27 versus 16). 
AEs of special interest 
Given toxicities associated with nucleoside inhibitors/ polymerase inhibitors in the past, renal failure, 
cardiac failure, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, and pancreatitis events were followed closely. Of note, none 
of those AEs were observed with sofosbuvir. No particular AEs associated with the NS5A class are known 
so far.

Apart from one patient in the phase 3 studies, who had a history of chronic pancreatitis and who had an 
episode of acute pancreatitis during study, none of the events were observed in the Phse III studies ION-1, 
-2 and -3.  
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events 
Any Grade 4 AEs were seen in 4 patients treated with SOF/LDV (out of total 1078), none considered 
related to study drug: 
1 patient with 6 AEs following a road traffic accident, 
1 with unstable angina, 
1 with anaphylactic reaction (to triamcinolone),  
1 patient with hypoglycemia (patient with diabetes, on insulin treatment). 
Grade 3 AEs were seen in <5% of patients, and with large a spectrum of different preferred terms 
reported. There is no particular AE that stands out as more likely related to therapy. AEs of grade 3 or 
higher were seen in fully similar frequencies with and without RBV. Interestingly, the increase in common 
AEs, observed when RBV was added to the regimen, wer eof low intensity.

While headache and fatigue may be side effects associated with SOF/LDV, severe events were rare. 
Serious adverse events 
Serious AEs were more frequently reported in ION-1 than in the following studies. A summary of AE 
preferred terms reported and sorted in alphabetic order is shown in Table 25. The pattern does not seem 
indicative for any event likely associated with SOF/LDV. For example, the number of fractures was 
considerable - all related to accidents/trauma.

A total of 6 serious adverse events in five patients were reported as related to study drug: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
anemia, 2 occasions in 1 patient (SOF/LDV + RBV), related to RBV therapy, resolved after RBV dose 
reduction. 
acute mesenteric vein thrombosis (SOF/LDV) in a patient with a history of cirrhosis, 
hypersplenomegaly,intravenous drug use and alcoholism. Therapy was stopped for 2 days, and then 
continued. The thrombosis resolved after around 4 months of anti-coagulants (warfarin). 
factor VIII inhibition (SOF/LDV) in a patient with known mild hemophilia. Continuous bleeding after 
blood sampling noted after 5 months of treatment and 1 month later the patient was admitted to 
hospital for spontaneous bleeding in pelvic area. Inhibition of Factor VIII was documented, and 
reported as a serious adverse event related to therapy. 
salpingitis (SOF/LDV) of grade 3, event resolved without interrupting therapy. 
•  headache (SOF/LDV) of grade 3, starting after 6 days of treatment - not reported as resolved. 
Of note, there was no pre-clinical signal for effects on blood coagulation, and factor VIII inhibition is a 
known complication of hemophilia.  
Deaths 
No treatment related deaths were reported in the SOF/LDV Phase 3 Safety Population. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver chemistry 
Transaminases normalized during therapy, and liver chemistry was overall without specific signs of 
concern (Table 26).

One patient (with cirrhosis in ION-1, treated with SOF/LDV + RBV for 12 weeks) met Hy’s law criteria. The 
bilirubin elevation, peaking during weak 2 and then declining, was considered related to RBV. Treatment 
was continued throughout the 12 weeks, and AST and ALT levels subsequently decreased. 
ALT levels of >5 x ULN were seen in 4 patients. None of the events was considered related to study drug, 
or clinically significant. Study treatment was completed in 4/4. 
Of the 46 patients with a total bilirubin >2 x ULN, 44 were receiving RBV-containing treatment, which is 
known to cause hemolysis. The other 2 had increased bilirubin already at baseline, suggesting 
pre-existing conditions. The frequency of BIL>2 xULN in patients treated with SOF/LDV + RBV (5.8% in 
ams 12-24 weeks), is fairly identical to the frequency observed with SOF + RBV in the sofosbuvir program, 
further supporting that neither SOF nor LDV (cleared via liver and bile) cause an increase in bilirubin.  
Other blood chemistry 
For patients treated with SOF/LDV no relevant change from baseline was seen for hemoglobin, white 
blood cells (including lymphocytes) or platelets. Creatinine levels were not impacted by treatment. 
Reductions in hemoglobin and lymphocytes were seen when adding RBV, as expected. In ION-1 around 
15% of patients in the RBV-containing arms had a dose reduction in RBV (35/217 in 12 weeks-arm and 
38/217 in 24 weeks-arm) - all achieved SVR. In ION-2 those numbers were 10% and 15%, respectively. 
Lipase increases of grade 3 or 4 were seen in a limited number of patients, with a higher frequency in 
those treated longer. All except 1 (acute pancreatitis, discussed previously) were asymptomatic, and the 
lab disturbance resolved/normalized with time, without interruptions of therapy in any patient and there 
was no trend for lipase elevations over time was seen in general. Hence, an association to SOF/LDV seems 
unlikely. 
Electrocardiograms 
Thorough QTc studies have been performed for the individual components, SOF and LDV, and neither 
agent showed any effects on cardiac repolarization or prolongation of the QTcF interval. 
Safety in special populations 
Hepatic Impairment  
The SOF/LDV Phase 3 program excluded subjects with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. The percentages of 
subjects with any AE, Grade 3 or 4 AE, and AEs leading to study drug modification or interruption were 
similar for noncirrhotic subjects (73.8%, 4.0%, and 0.5%, respectively) and cirrhotic subjects (76.6%, 
6.3%, and 0.9%) treated with SOF/LDV in phase 3.

Within Cohort A, the incidence of treatment-related AEs, treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 AEs, 
treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs), and treatment-emergent deaths observed was similar 
between subjects with CPT B and C decompensated cirrhosis. This result is supported by the data from 
Cohort B. Across these groups of post-transplantation subjects, ranging from subjects with no cirrhosis to 
those with compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis, there was no apparent trend to suggest 
worsening hepatic function is associated with a safety signal attributable to LDV/SOF. 
Across treatment groups (N = 337) the most commonly reported AEs were fatigue (49.3%), headache 
(30.6%) and anemia (30.3%). Ten treatment-emergent deaths were reported, none of which were 
considered related to study drug by the investigators. Causes included complications of cirrhosis such as 
septicemia. 
The study design without a placebo control precludes a precise characterization of the safety of SOF/LDV 
is this severely ill population. All in all, however, the emerging safety profile seems compatible with what 
might be anticipated as the natural course of very advanced liver disease, and no toxicity signal specific 
for patients with decompensated liver disease is apparent. 
Renal Impairment 
In phase 3 patients with an eGFR of < 60 mL/min at screening were excluded. A summary of available 
data in patients with reduced renal function, including many of the patients treated in the SOLAR-1 study,

does not identify any specific emerging safety concern in this population. A dedicated study of SOF+RBV 
in severe renal failure is ongoing. 
Elderly 
Across the treatment groups in the SOF/LDV Phase 3 Safety Population, 7.8% of subjects were ≥ 65 years 
of age. None of the SOF/LDV Phase 3 studies imposed an upper age limit as part of the study entry 
criteria. 
For the RBV-free (SOF/LDV) groups, the percentages of subjects with any AE, Grade 3 or 4 AE, and AEs 
leading to study drug modification or interruption was similar for subjects aged < 65 years (73.8%, 4.1%, 
and 0.5%, respectively) and ≥ 65 years (76.7%, 5.6%, and 1.1%, respectively). 
For the RBV-containing (SOF/LDV+RBV) groups, higher percentages of subjects aged ≥65 years (90.3% 
and 11.3%, respectively) experienced any AE and Grade 3 or 4 AE compared with subjects aged < 65 
years (85.1% and 4.7%, respectively). Additionally, in subjects receiving SOF/LDV+RBV, AEs leading to 
study drug modification or interruption were also reported at an approximately 3-fold higher incidence in 
subjects aged ≥65 years (33.9%) compared with subjects aged < 65 years (12.0%). Consistent with the 
increase in AEs leading to study drug modification or interruption in RBV-containing (SOF/LDV+RBV) 
groups, anaemia was reported at a higher incidence in subjects aged ≥ 65 years (22.6%) compared with 
subjects aged < 65 years (8.5%). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Sofosbuvir as a single agent has a large safety data base with a favourable tolerability and safety profile 
that is not clearly distinct from placebo. That data was to a considerable extent generated in combination 
with RBV or peg-IFN + RBV (with associated side effects). Section 4.8 of the Sovaldi SmPC therefore 
includes AEs that are actually related to RBV and/or peg-IFN. 
The safety of SOF/LDV is mainly based on the phase 3 studies (ION-1 to -3), where 1080 patients 
received SOF/LDV and 834 received SOF/LDV + RBV. The former group reported common AEs of a type 
and frequency that is quite in line with those reported for placebo in the sofosbuvir program. Safety in the 
RBV containing arms was typical of the AE profile previously described for this agent.  
The addition of RBV increased the frequency of grade 1-2 AEs (of the pattern typical for this agent); the 
frequency of grade 3-4 AEs was similarly low as with SOF/LDV alone, and there was no increase in 
treatment discontinuations when RBV was added to the regimen. Hence, the addition of RBV to minimize 
the risk for relapse in certain patients is not associated with any major safety issues. 
During the evaluation, the applicant submitted safety data from the double blind placebo controlled 
SIRIUS study, performed in patients with cirrhosis. This study is indicative that headache and fatigue may 
be specific side effects of SOF/LDV. These events observed were generally mild in intensity.  
When scrutinizing all severe AEs, there was no cases that seemed likely related to treatment. No 
treatment-emergent deaths were reported.  
Apart from RBV-related haemolysis with reductions in Hb and increased indirect bilirubin, there are no 
haematological or blood chemistry findings of particular concern or considered likely related to treatment. 
No case suggestive of DILI was observed.  
There was no trend towards a significant deterioration of the safety profile of SOF/LDV in compensated 
cirrhotics (n=224). Furthermore, during the review process the applicant submitted safety data from the 
SOLAR-1 study, where SOF/LDV + RBV was given to patients with decompensated liver disease (n=167) 
and/or status post transplantation. RBV was given at a reduced starting dose in those with hepatic

impairment. A considerable proportion of the decompensated patients in SOLAR-1 had MELD scores >15. 
While treatment appears to have been well tolerated with low rates of discontinuations due to AEs, as 
anticipated the frequency of serious adverse events and deaths were higher in this population compared 
to those with compensated liver disease. Events were characteristic of the natural course of end stage 
liver disease. While in the absence of a placebo control, any contribution of SOF/LDV to the treatment 
emergent adverse effect profile cannot be ascertained with certainty, no signal of toxicity specific to this 
population has been identified. 
All the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of SOF/LDV in patients with compensated liver disease due to HCV infection, and a 
calculated GFR >60 ml/min, is favorable. Mild headache and fatigue may be side effects typical of this 
drug combination. The addition of RBV increased the frequency of AEs typical of this agent but these were 
generally mild and do not result in increased discontinuation rates. The safety database in 
decompensated liver disease is non-comparative which to some extent limits interpretability; however, 
SOF/LDV appears well tolerated and no specific safety concern has been identified.

Routine Risk Minimization Measures 
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC; Sections 4.4 and 4.5) includes 
information that potent Pgp inducers (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) 
should not be used with LDV/SOF due to the potential for significant decreases in 
LDV/SOF plasma concentrations, which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of 
LDV/SOF. St. John’s wort is contraindicated in Section 4.3. 
The SmPC (Section 4.5) includes information about the maximum allowed dose and 
simultaneous coadministration of LDV/SOF and proton pump inhibitors, as staggered 
dosing has the potential for decreases in LDV plasma concentrations, which may lead 
to reduced therapeutic effect of LDV/SOF. 
The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) includes information of how LDV/SOF co-use with 
TDF+PK enhancer increases tenofovir concentrations, safety is not established, 
consider risks and benefits particularly in patients at increased risk for renal 
dysfunction, monitor for tenofovir-associated ADRs, and refer to SmPCs for Viread, 
Truvada, or Stribild for renal monitoring recommendations. 
The SmPC (Section 4.3, 4.5) includes information that use of rosuvastatin with 
LDV/SOF is contraindicated due to the potential for significant increases in 
rosuvastatin. 
The SmPC (Section 4.5) includes information that coadministration of LDV/SOF and 
digoxin should be used with caution due to the potential for an increase in digoxin 
concentration and that therapeutic concentration monitoring of digoxin is 
recommended. 
The SmPC states that the safety and efficacy of LDV/SOF in pediatric subjects have 
not been established and that LDV/SOF is not recommended for use in children and 
adolescents < 18 years of age (Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8) and that the PK of LDV/SOF 
and GS-331007 have not been established in children (Section 5.2).  
The SmPC states that, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid use of 
LDV/SOF during pregnancy and that LDV/SOF should not be used during 
breastfeeding. 
The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) provide warnings and information on 
administration of LDV/SOF with many HIV medicines. No additional risk minimization 
measures are considered necessary for this population at this time. The need for risk 
minimization measures will be reassessed following the availability of the results 
from ongoing studies.  
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that no data are available in this population. No 
additional risk minimization measures are considered necessary for this population. 
The need for risk minimization measures will be reassessed following the availability 
of the results from 1 cohort of a clinical trial or from routine pharmacovigilance. 
The SmPC (Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2) states that no dose adjustment of LDV/SOF is 
required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and that the safety of 
LDV/SOF has not been assessed in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) or end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) requiring hemodialysis.  
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that in patients who fail treatment with LDV/SOF, 
selection of NS5A resistance mutations that substantially reduce the susceptibility to 
LDV is seen in the majority of cases. Limited data indicate that such NS5A mutations 
do not revert on long term follow up. 
The efficacy of LDV as part of a retreatment regimen in patients with prior exposure 
and selection of resistance to a NS5A inhibitor has not been established. The need for 
risk minimization measures will be reassessed following the availability of the results 
from studies or from routine pharmacovigilance.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The use of SOF/LDV in HCV genotype 1 infection 
In previously untreated patients, with or without compensated cirrhosis, 12 weeks of therapy +/- 
ribavirin gave an overall SVR rate of 97.3-97.7%. Sixty-five out of sixty-seven treatment naïve 
compensated cirrhotics reached SVR (ION-1). 
In previously untreated patients without cirrhosis, 8 weeks of therapy +/- ribavirin yielded overall SVR 
rates of 93.1-94%, while 12 weeks of therapy without ribavirin gave an SVR rate of 95.4% (ION-3). 
In treatment experienced patients (previous non-response to pegIFN+RBV or pegIFN+RBV+an NS3/4A 
inhibitor), with or without compensated cirrhosis, 12 weeks of therapy, +/- ribavirin, yielded SVR rates of 
93.6 and 96.4%, respectively, while 24 weeks of therapy +/- ribavirin gave an SVR rate of 99.1% 
(ION-2). 
The use of SOF/LDV in HCV genotype 3 infection 
In a small sample of previously untreated patients with genotype 3 virus infection, 8 of whom had 
cirrhosis, SOD/LDV for 12 weeks; an SVR rate of 64% (16/25) was achieved. When ribavirin was added 
to the same regimen, the SVR rate was 100% (26/26), including 5/5 compensated cirrhotics (data from 
ELECTRON- 2 study). Interim data from the same study showed that in treatment experienced patients 
without cirrhosis, SVR4 was reached in 89% (25/28) patients. In cirrhotic treatment experienced patients 
SVR4 was reached in 17/22 (77%) of patients. 
The use of SOF/LDV in HCV genotype 4 infection 
Preliminary data from clinical studies are indicative of a substantial contribution of LDV to efficacy in the 
tretamenbt of GT4 infection. The combination of in vitro data and these available clinical outcomes are 
indicative that SOF/LDV for 12 weeks is an effective regimen for the treatment of GT4 infection. 
The use of SOF/LDV in patients with decompensated liver disease and/or post transplantation 
Interim data from the SOLAR-1 study performed in genotype 1 and -4 patients (genotype 1 infection in 
the vast majority) showed an SVR4 rate of 90% (70/78) in patients with CPT-B or –C and treated with 
SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks. The SVR12 rate was 84% (58/69). When treatment was extended to 24 
weeks, the SVR4 rate was 88% (57/65). SVR12 data are not available. 
In the same study, among post-transplant patients without cirrhosis, the SVR12 rate was 96% (53/55) 
with 12 weeks of SOF/LDV+RBV. When treatment was extended to 24 weeks the SVR4 rate was 98% 
(53/54). In post-transplant patients with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, SVR12 rates with 12 
weeks of SOF/LDV+RBV was 87% (42/48). With 24 weeks of therapy, the SVR4 rate was 90% (38/42).

In patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis 4/4 achieved SVR4 after 12 weeks of therapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The relative efficacy observed when SOF/LDV is administered for 24 versus 12 weeks in compensated 
cirrhotics with genotype 1 infection is not fully clarified. 
While a cross study comparison of the efficacy of SOF/LDV +/- RBV for 12 weeks in genotype 3 is 
indicative that LDV contributes to efficacy on top of the background therapy of SOF +/- RBV, it is notable 
that data do not show a strong selective pressure of LDV on the virus (i.e. NS5A RAVs were not detected 
at time of relapse in majority of patients who failed therapy). Furthermore, there are no monotherapy 
data or on-treatment viral kinetics data to support the contribution of LDV to this regimen. The magnitude 
of the contribution of LDV to a regimen of SOF/LDV+RBV in genotype 3 is unclear. The relative efficacy of 
SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks versus SOF+RBV for 24 weeks also remains unclear; a relapse rate prior to 
week 4 of 23% in treatment experienced cirrhotics, however, indicate that 12 weeks of therapy does not 
yield maximal efficacy in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients.The applicant is not planning a 
phase III study in GT3. In vitro data as well as clinical efficacy data indicate the SOF/LDV for 12 weeks is 
a highly effective regimen for the treatment of genotype 4, however clinical data are sparse and immature 
(SVR4). 
The relative efficacy of 12 versus 24 weeks of SOF/LDV+RBV in patients with decompensated liver 
disease is unclear given that the SOLAR-1 study results are interim. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database for SOF/LDV contains around 2000 patients. The safety profile is favourable, with 
very few treatment discontinuations. Furthermore, while the typical side effects of ribavirin (e.g., anemia) 
are noted, this drug was generally well tolerated when used in combination with SOF/LDV. SOF/LDV is 
associated with an increased rate of headache and fatigue, which were mild in intensity. No other side 
effects were observed with this drug combination. 
There were virtually no on-treatment virological breakthroughs; therefore virological failure may be 
considered equal to relapse after the end of treatment. The main determinant for risk of relapse was 
treatment duration.  
Virological relapse is often associated with the selection of viral variants resistant to LDV as well as to 
other available NS5A inhibitors. Available data are indicative that such variants persist after 
discontinuation of drug related selection pressure. This is anticipated to impact the efficacy of NS5A 
inhibitors as part of a retreatment regimen. Therefore, an unfavourable effect observed in the study 
program was virologic relapse, presumably due to an insufficient duration of therapy, or the lack of a fully 
active regimen due to BL NS5A resistance in some patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The consequence of relapse in terms of potential retreatment strategies is unclear. Previously untreated 
patients that relapse with NS5A inhibitor resistance have likely effective re-treatment options. However, 
this is less clear for those patients that previously failed therapy containing an NS3/4A inhibitor. 
The role and potential residual efficacy of LDV within a retreatment regimen in patients with pre-selected 
NS5A resistance remains unclear. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702742/2014 
Page 76/80 
  
  
While available data indicate that SOF/LDV is well tolerated without any specific side effects in patients 
with decompensated liver disease, the lack of a placebo control in this population hampers the certainty 
of this observation. 
The appropriate dosing of SOF and the safety of SOF/LDV has not been clarified in patients with severe 
renal impairment. 
There are some unclarities related to drug-drug interactions; e.g, what is the minimal exposure to LDV 
that is associated with retaining maximal efficacy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
SOF/LDV with or without ribavirin has shown high efficacy against genotypes 1, including patients 
post-transplant and/or with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis. 
While SOF is fully active against GT-3, the activity of LDV is poorly characterized virologically against this 
genotype. However, available clinical data are indicative that LDV does contribute to the antiviral efficacy 
when used in combination with SOF+RBV. 
In vitro data and limited clinical data indicate high efficacy of SOF/LDV, also in GT-4. This treatment 
regimen is well tolerated and the benefit-risk balance is clearly positive. 
The type of treatment regimen (treatment duration, addition of ribavirin) to be recommended in different 
clinical situations is not self-evident based on available data. A regimen of insufficient duration or lacking 
ribavirin may be associated with a suboptimal virological response, which is translated in an increased 
relapse rate. In case of relapse, until proven otherwise, it is presumed that LDV as well as other NS5A 
inhibitors generally loose a considerable part of their antiviral efficacy due to the selection of resistant 
variants that persist despite the discontinuation of drug pressure. This fact would limit retreatment 
options. 
In most cases, relapse would not be an immediate and urgent clinical concern, as non-cirrhotic patients 
would not be at short term risk of clinical disease progression, and as patients without prior exposure to 
a NS3/4A inhibitor would have other likely curative retreatment option. However, for patients with 
advanced liver disease, manifested, e.g., by low platelet counts or by biochemical abnormalities related 
to liver function, failure to achieve viral clearance may be associated with a tangible short term risk of 
disease progression. Furthermore, all presently available combination DAA treatment options might have 
reduced efficacy in patients that have preselected for viral resistance against both NS3/4A inhibitors as 
well as NS5A inhibitors. Therefore, it is considered particularly important to avoid unnecessary relapses in 
patients with advanced liver disease and in patients with prior NS3/4A experience. These considerations 
are reflected in the recommended treatment regimens in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Recommended regimens for patients with genotype 1 infection 
Eight and 12 weeks of SOF/LDV have been compared in non-cirrhotic treatment naïve patients. There is 
no difference in tolerability depending on treatment duration. The relapse rate is higher with 8 weeks of 
therapy as compared to 12 weeks of therapy (5.1 versus 1.4%). Moreover, 6 weeks treatment duration 
in ELECTRON study has shown to be sub-optimal. While 12 weeks of therapy will yield a higher SVR rate, 
the number needed to treat for an extra SVR above 8 weeks will be high. Furthermore, patients within this 
category that relapse are anticipated to have effective retreatment options available. In addition, the 
short term risk of clinical disease progression in non-cirrhotic patients is very low. In explorative analyses, 
male gender, IL28B C/C genotype and higher baseline viral load were associated with an increased risk of 
relapse in case of 8 rather than 12 weeks of therapy. While 12 weeks may be optimal in terms of

benefit-risk, the clinician may consider an 8 week treatment course on a case to case basis. Information 
on predictors of relapse with 8 weeks of therapy is included in section 5.1. of the SmPC 
In the absence of cross resistance, treatment experienced patients are considered a functional subgroup 
of the treatment naïve population preselected by response to prior therapy, were negative predictive 
factors for cure (such as IL-28 non-CC genotype) are enriched. A such-defined patient population has not 
been studied with 8 weeks of therapy. However, data indicate that 12 weeks of treatment with SOF/LDV 
is highly effective in non-cirrhotic treatment experienced patients. Therefore, this is the general 
recommendation. However, it is notable that the term “treatment experienced” today encompasses also 
patients with experience of prior treatment failure on direct acting antivirals such as NS3/4A inhibitors. 
While numbers are small, the relapse rate in the ION-2 study was higher with 12 compared to 24 weeks, 
and most evident in those patients that had baseline viral variants with reduced LDV susceptibility that 
were detectable with deep sequencing (detected in ~15% of the general genotype 1 population). The 
utility of baseline resistance testing to guide regimen selection (duration, addition of ribavirin) has been 
considered. However, due to uncertainties on both utility and availability of such testing, the applicant 
suggests that this should not be generally recommended in order to define the appropriate regimen. The 
CHMP concurs with this argument. However, the relevant dat on impact of baseline NS5A variants of 
efficacy have been included in section 5.1. of the SmPC. Furthermore, while 12 weeks of SOF/LDV is the 
generally recommended treatment regimen for treatment experienced non-cirrhotic patients, section 4.2 
of the SmPC states that a prolongation of therapy to 24 weeks should be considered in those patients 
where there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of retreatment options. 
In treatment naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis, 12 weeks of SOF/LDV yielded high SVR ratesand 
the addition of RBV did not confer any apparent increase in efficacy. However, numbers are small and 
there are reasons to believe that in an unselected treatment naïve cirrhotic population, 24 weeks of 
therapy may be associated with a lower relapse rate. 
The rationale for this consideration comes from ION-2. As previously stated, treatment experienced 
patients are considered a difficult to cure subgroup of a general population, preselected by their previous 
failure to clear virus on therapy. While the small sample size is recognized, the relapse rate in cirrhotics 
in ION-2 ranged from 14-18% with 12 weeks of therapy versus 0% with 24 weeks treatment. Therefore, 
available data indicate that 24 weeks of SOF/LDV would be the primary option in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis. However, it is proposed that in such patients that have likely effective 
retreatment options, and that are deemed by the prescriber to be at a negligible short-term risk of clinical 
disease progression, 12 weeks of therapy may be considered, as the absolute SVR rate would still be high. 
A considerable umber of decompensated cirrhotics is studied in the SOLAR-studies, but data are 
preliminary. It is of some interest that, from a numerical point of view, treatment duration rather than the 
addition of RBV seemed to impact outcomes in compensated cirrhotics in the ION-2 study. With 
decompensated cirrhosis, however, a cross study comparison on ELECTRON 2 and SOLAR-1 would 
indicate that the addition of RBV increases regimen efficacy. If this is indeed correct, it could be due to 
issues of the activation of SOF into its active moiety in patients with hepatic impairment. As all regimens 
in SOLAR 1 contained RBV, the recommended regimen in patients with decompensated liver disease is 
SOF/LDV+RBV (this is also applicable for patients post-transplant in general, regardless of hepatic 
function). These preliminary data preclude the analysis of the relative efficacy of SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 
versus 24 weeks. In the absence of a clear understanding of the relative efficacy of the shorter treatment 
duration compared to the longer in these patients with very advanced disease, a conservative 
recommendation of 24 weeks of therapy seems warranted and as the regimen of SOF/LDV + RBV, (the 
latter initiated at a lower dose) is adequately tolerated in decompensated cirrhotics.  
Genotype 2 
The use of LDV is not recommended in genotype 2 due to the absence of data.

Recommendations for genotype 3 
While the totality of evidence indicates that LDV adds activity against genotype 3, no extrapolations from 
genotype 1 can be made, due to the considerably higher EC50 value in genotype 3. Furthermore, available 
clinical data are scarce, and the absolute efficacy of SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks in a broad population is 
unknown. SOF+RBV for 24 weeks (the presently approved IFN-free regimen for GT-3 infection) has not 
been compared to SOF/LDV + RBV for 12 weeks within the same study (the latter may in fact be inferior). 
The only conclusion on appropriate use that can be drawn is that the addition of LDV to a regimen of 
SOF+RBV most likely increases the chance for SVR in those patients where SOF+RBV alone is not an 
optimal treatment regimen. On this basis, the use of SOF/LDV + RBV (rather than SOF + RBV) for 24 
weeks may be recommended in treatment experienced and/or cirrhotic patients with genotype 
3-infection. 
Recommendations for genotype 4 
In vitro data are indicative that SOF/LDV for 12 weeks should be an effective regimen against genotype 
4. This is supported by SVR4 data. By extrapolation, the regimens studied in different clinical situations 
for genotype 1 are considered of relevance also for genotype 4. However, EC50 values are higher than in 
GT1. Furthermore, patients with genotype 4 infection tend on average to have lower plasma HCV-RNA 
than patients with genotype 1 infection. These circumstances create some uncertainty to relative efficacy 
of 8 versus 12 weeks of therapy in genotype 4. For this reason, a sufficient basis for an 8 week 
recommendation in genotype 4 is considered lacking.

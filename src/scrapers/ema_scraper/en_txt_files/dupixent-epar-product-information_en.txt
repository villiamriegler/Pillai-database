Dupilumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be 
used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital 
areas. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response 
after 16 weeks of treatment for atopic dermatitis. Some patients with initial partial response may 
subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. If dupilumab treatment interruption 
becomes necessary, patients can still be successfully re-treated. 
Asthma 
Adults and adolescents 
The recommended dose of dupilumab for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) is: 
•  For patients with severe asthma and who are on oral corticosteroids or for patients with severe 
asthma and co-morbid moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or adults with co-morbid severe 
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), 
followed by 300 mg every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. 
•  For all other patients, an initial dose of 400 mg (two 200 mg injections), followed by 200 mg 
every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. 
Children 6 to 11 years of age 
The recommended dose of dupilumab for paediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is specified in 
Table 4.

Initial and subsequent doses 
300 mg every four weeks (Q4W) 
200 mg every other week (Q2W) 
or 
300 mg every four weeks (Q4W) 
200 mg every other week (Q2W) 
For paediatric patients (6 to 11 years old) with asthma and co-morbid severe atopic dermatitis, as per 
approved indication, the recommended dose should be followed in Table 2. 
Patients receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids may reduce their steroid dose once clinical 
improvement with dupilumab has occurred (see section 5.1). Steroid reductions should be 
accomplished gradually (see section 4.4). 
Dupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered 
at least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s level of asthma 
control.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  
The recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 300 mg followed by 
300 mg given every other week. 
Dupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing 
treatment in patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for CRSwNP. Some 
patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 24 
weeks. 
Prurigo Nodularis (PN) 
The recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg 
injections), followed by 300 mg given every other week.  
Dupilumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. 
PN clinical trial data are available for patients treated up to 24 weeks. Consideration should be given 
to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for PN. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) 
The recommended dose of dupilumab for patients 12 years of age and older is 300 mg given every 
week (QW). 
Dupilumab 300 mg QW has not been studied in patients with EoE weighing less than 40 kg. 
Dupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. Dupilumab 300 mg QW has been studied up to 52 
weeks. Dosing beyond 52 weeks has not been studied.  
Missed dose  
If a weekly dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible, starting a new schedule based on 
this date. 
If an every other week dose is missed, administer the injection within 7 days from the missed dose and 
then resume the patient's original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, wait 
until the next dose on the original schedule. 
If an every 4 week dose is missed, administer the injection within 7 days from the missed dose and 
then resume the patient's original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, 
administer the dose, starting a new schedule based on this date. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data 
are available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Body weight 
No dose adjustment for body weight is recommended for patients with asthma and EoE 12 years of age 
and older or in adults with atopic dermatitis or CRSwNP, or PN (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 6 months 
have not been established. The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with a body weight < 5 kg 
have not been established. No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with severe asthma below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy in children with CRSwNP below the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with PN below the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with EoE below the age of 12 years have not been 
established. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use 
The dupilumab pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For children 6 
months to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis and asthma, the dupilumab pre-filled syringe is the 
presentation appropriate for administration to this population. 
Dupilumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except for the 5 cm 
around the navel. If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. 
Each pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen is for single use only. 
For the initial 600 mg dose, two 300 mg injections should be administered consecutively in different 
injection sites. 
It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. Dupilumab should not be injected 
into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. 
A patient may self-inject dupilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer dupilumab if their 
healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to 
patients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of dupilumab prior to use according to 
the Instructions for Use (IFU) section at the end of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Acute asthma exacerbations 
Dupilumab should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Dupilumab 
should not be used to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

Corticosteroids 
Systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids should not be discontinued abruptly upon initiation of 
therapy with dupilumab. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and 
performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be 
associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by 
systemic corticosteroid therapy. 
Biomarkers of type 2 inflammation may be suppressed by systemic corticosteroid use. This should be 
taken into consideration to determine type 2 status in patients taking oral corticosteroids (see section 
5.1). 
Hypersensitivity 
If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of dupilumab 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Cases of anaphylactic reaction, 
angioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported. Anaphylactic 
reactions and angioedema have occurred from minutes to up to seven days after the dupilumab 
injection (see section 4.8). 
Eosinophilic conditions 
Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (EGPA) have been reported with dupilumab in adult patients who participated in the 
asthma development program. Cases of vasculitis consistent with EGPA have been reported with 
dupilumab and placebo in adult patients with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development 
program. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac 
complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Patients being treated 
for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features 
of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 
conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not 
always, may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
Helminth infection 
Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. 
Dupilumab may influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 
signaling. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating dupilumab. 
If patients become infected while receiving treatment with dupilumab and do not respond to anti-
helminth treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. Cases of 
enterobiasis were reported in children 6 to 11 years old who participated in the paediatric asthma 
development program (see section 4.8). 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events have been reported with dupilumab, predominantly in atopic 
dermatitis patients. Some patients reported visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision) associated with 
conjunctivitis or keratitis (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be advised to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare 
provider. Patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following 
standard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis should undergo ophthalmological 
examination, as appropriate (see section 4.8).  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with comorbid asthma 
Patients on dupilumab who also have co-morbid asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma 
treatments without consultation with their physicians. Patients with comorbid asthma should be 
monitored carefully following discontinuation of dupilumab. 
Vaccinations 
Concurrent use of live and live attenuated vaccines with dupilumab should be avoided  as clinical 
safety and efficacy have not been established. It is recommended that patients should be brought up to 
date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines 
prior to treatment with dupilumab. Clinical data are not available to support more specific guidance for 
live or live attenuated vaccines administration in patients treated with dupilumab. Immune responses 
to TdaP vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were assessed (see section 4.5).  
Sodium content  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 300 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Immune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which patients with atopic dermatitis 
were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab. After 12 weeks of dupilumab 
administration, patients were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (T cell-dependent), and a meningococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (T cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. 
Antibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in 
dupilumab-treated and placebo-treated patients. No adverse interactions between either of the non-live 
vaccines and dupilumab were noted in the study.  
Therefore, patients receiving dupilumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. 
For information on live vaccines see section 4.4. 
In a clinical study of atopic dermatitis patients, the effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of CYP substrates were evaluated. The data gathered from this study did not indicate clinically 
relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. 
An effect of dupilumab on the PK of co-administered medicinal products is not expected. Based on the 
population analysis, commonly co-administered medicinal products had no effect on dupilumab 
pharmacokinetics on patients with moderate to severe asthma. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of dupilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Dupilumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to 
the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dupilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue dupilumab therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

Fertility 
Animal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Dupilumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP are injection site 
reactions (includes erythema, oedema, pruritus, pain, and swelling), conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis 
allergic, arthralgia, oral herpes, and eosinophilia. An additional adverse reaction of injection site 
bruising was reported in EoE. Rare cases of serum sickness, serum sickness-like reaction, anaphylactic 
reaction, and ulcerative keratitis have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The dupilumab safety data presented in Table 5 were predominantly derived from 12 randomised, 
placebo-controlled trials, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP patients. These studies 
involved 4,206 patients receiving dupilumab and 2,326 patients receiving placebo during the 
controlled period are representative of the overall safety profile for dupilumab. 
Listed in Table 5 are adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and/or postmarketing setting 
presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypersensitivity 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have 
been reported following administration of dupilumab (see section 4.4). 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis patients who received 
dupilumab compared to placebo in atopic dermatitis studies. Most patients with conjunctivitis or 
keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. In the long-term OLE atopic 
dermatitis study (AD-1225) at 5 years, the respective rates of conjunctivitis and keratitis remained 
similar to those in the dupilumab arm in the placebo controlled atopic dermatitis studies. Among 
asthma patients frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was low and similar between dupilumab and 
placebo. Among CRSwNP and Prurigo Nodularis (PN) patients the frequency of conjunctivitis was 
higher in dupilumab than placebo, though lower than that observed in atopic dermatitis patients. There 
were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP or PN development program. Among patients with 
EoE, the frequency of conjunctivitis was low and similar between dupilumab and placebo groups. 
There were no cases of keratitis in the EoE development program (see section 4.4). 
Eczema herpeticum 
Eczema herpeticum was reported in < 1% of the dupilumab groups and in < 1 % of the placebo group 
in the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy adult studies. In the 52-week atopic dermatitis 
dupilumab + TCS adult study, eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.2 % of the dupilumab + TCS 
group and 1.9 % of the placebo + TCS group. These rates remained stable at 5 years in the long-term 
OLE study (AD-1225). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eosinophilia 
Dupilumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count 
compared to patients treated with placebo in the atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP indications. 
Eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during study treatment and returned to baseline 
during the asthma open-label extension safety study (TRAVERSE). The mean blood eosinophil levels 
decreased to below baseline by week 20 and was maintained up to 5 years in the long-term OLE study 
(AD-1225). Compared to placebo, no increase in mean blood eosinophil counts was observed in PN 
(PRIME and PRIME2). Mean and median blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or 
remained below baseline levels in EoE (TREET Parts A and B) during study treatment. 
Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in < 3 % of dupilumab-treated 
patients and < 0.5 % in placebo-treated patients (SOLO1, SOLO2, AD-1021, DRI12544, QUEST, and 
VOYAGE; SINUS-24 and SINUS-52, PRIME, and PRIME2 studies; TREET Parts A and B). 
Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in 8.4% of dupilumab-treated 
patients and 0% in placebo-treated patients in study AD-1539, with median eosinophil counts 
declining below baseline at end of treatment period. 
Infections 
In the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy clinical adult studies, serious infections were reported in 
1.0 % of patients treated with placebo and 0.5 % of patients treated with dupilumab. In the 52-week 
atopic dermatitis CHRONOS adult study, serious infections were reported in 0.6 % of patients treated 
with placebo and 0.2 % of patients treated with dupilumab. The rates of serious infections remained 
stable at 5 years in the long-term OLE study (AD-1225). 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for asthma clinical studies. In the 24-week safety pool, serious infections were 
reported in 1.0% of patients treated with dupilumab and 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. In the 
52-week QUEST study, serious infections were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with dupilumab 
and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo. 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for CRSwNP clinical studies. In the 52-week SINUS-52 study, serious infections 
were reported in 1.3 % of patients treated with dupilumab and 1.3 % of patients treated with placebo. 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for PN clinical studies. In the safety pool, serious infections were reported in 1.3% of 
patients treated with dupilumab and 1.3% of patients treated with placebo. 
The  overall  incidence  of  infections  was  numerically  higher  with  dupilumab  (32.0%)  compared  to 
placebo (24.8%) in the safety pool for EoE TREET (Parts A and B) studies. In the 24-week safety pool, 
serious infections were reported in 0.5% of patients treated with dupilumab and 0% of patients treated 
with placebo. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with dupilumab. 
Anti-Drug-Antibodies (ADA) responses were not generally associated with impact on dupilumab 
exposure, safety, or efficacy. 
Approximately 5 % of patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or CRSwNP who received dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed ADA to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent 
ADA responses and approximately 2 % had neutralizing antibodies. Similar results were observed in 
adult patients with PN who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W for 24 weeks, paediatric patients (6 
months to 11 years of age) with atopic dermatitis who received either dupilumab 200 mg Q2W, 200 
mg Q4W, or 300 mg Q4W for 16 weeks and patients (6 to 11 years of age) with asthma who received 
dupilumab 100 mg Q2W or 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks. Similar ADA responses were observed in 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adult patients with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab for up to 5 years in the long-term OLE 
study (AD-1225). 
Approximately 16 % of adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 300 mg or 
200 mg Q2W for 16 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 3 % exhibited 
persistent ADA responses, and approximately 5 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Approximately 9 % of patients with asthma who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks 
developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 4 % exhibited persistent ADA responses and 
approximately 4 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Approximately 1% of patients with EoE who received dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W for 24 
weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; 0% exhibited persistent ADA responses and approximately 
0.5% had neutralizing antibodies. 
Regardless of age or population,  up to 4 % of patients in the placebo groups were positive for 
antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA response and approximately 
1 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Less than 1 % of patients who received dupilumab at approved dosing regimens exhibited high titer 
ADA responses associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In addition, there was one patient with 
serum sickness and one with serum sickness-like reaction (< 0.1 %) associated with high ADA titers 
(see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Atopic dermatitis 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 250 patients 12 to 17 years of age with 
moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  (AD-1526).  The  safety  profile  of  dupilumab  in  these 
patients  followed  through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults with 
atopic dermatitis. 
Children 6 to 11 years of age 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 367 patients 6 to 11 years of age with severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD-1652). The safety profile of dupilumab with concomitant TCS in these 
patients through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults and adolescents 
with atopic dermatitis. 
Children 6 months to 5 years of age 
The safety of dupilumab with concomitant TCS was assessed in a study of 161 patients 6 months to 
5 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which included a subgroup of 124 patients 
with severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1539). The safety profile of dupilumab with concomitant TCS in 
these patients through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults and paediatric 
patients 6 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis. 
Atopic Hand and Foot Dermatitis 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in 27 paediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-
severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis (AD-1924). The safety profile of dupilumab in these patients 
through Week 16 was consistent with the safety profile from studies in adult and paediatric patients 6 
months of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Asthma 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in the 52 week QUEST 
study. The safety profile observed was similar to that seen in adults. 
The long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in 89 adolescent patients who were enrolled in an 
open-label extension study in moderate-to-severe asthma (TRAVERSE). In this study, patients were 
followed for up to 96 weeks. The safety profile of dupilumab in TRAVERSE was consistent with the 
safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Children 6 to 11 years of age 
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE), the additional adverse 
reaction of enterobiasis was reported in 1.8 % (5 patients) in the dupilumab groups and none in the 
placebo group. All enterobiasis cases were mild to moderate and patients recovered with anti-helminth 
treatment without dupilumab treatment discontinuation.  
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma, eosinophilia (blood eosinophils 
≥ 3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event) was reported in 6.6 % of the 
dupilumab groups and 0.7% in the placebo group. Most eosinophilia cases were mild to moderate and 
not associated with clinical symptoms. These cases were transient, decreased over time, and did not 
lead to dupilumab treatment discontinuation. 
The long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in an open-label extension study (EXCURSION) in 
children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma who previously participated in 
VOYAGE. Among 365 patients who entered EXCURSION, 350 completed 52 weeks of treatment and 
228 patients completed a cumulative treatment duration of 104 weeks (VOYAGE and EXCURSION). 
The long-term safety profile of dupilumab in EXCURSION was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in the pivotal asthma study (VOYAGE) for 52 weeks of treatment. 
EoE 
A total of 99 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with EoE were enrolled in the TREET (Parts A and B) 
studies. The safety profile observed was similar to that seen in adults.  
Long-term safety 
Atopic dermatitis 
The safety profile of dupilumab + TCS (CHRONOS) in adult atopic dermatitis patients) through week 
52 was consistent with the safety profile observed at week 16. The long-term safety of dupilumab was 
assessed in an open-label extension study in patients 6 months to 17 years of age with moderate-to-
severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1434). The safety profile of dupilumab in patients followed through 
week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at week 16 in the AD-1526,  AD-1652, and AD-
1539 studies. The long-term safety profile of dupilumab observed in children and adolescents was 
consistent with that seen in adults with atopic dermatitis. 
In a phase 3, multicentre, open label extension (OLE) study (AD-1225), the long-term safety of repeat 
doses of dupilumab was assessed in 2,677 adults with moderate-to-severe AD exposed to 300 mg 
weekly dosing (99.7 %), including 179 who completed at least 260 weeks of the study. The long-term 
safety profile observed in this study up to 5 years was generally consistent with the safety profile of 
dupilumab observed in controlled studies. 
Asthma 
The safety profile of dupilumab in the 96 weeks long term safety study (TRAVERSE) was consistent 
with the safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
The safety profile of dupilumab in children with asthma 6 to 11 years of age who participated in the 52 
weeks long-term safety study (EXCURSION) was consistent with the safety profile observed in the 
pivotal asthma study (VOYAGE) for 52 weeks of treatment. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRSwNP 
The safety profile of dupilumab in adults with CRSwNP through week 52 was consistent with the 
safety profile observed at week 24. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis 
The safety profile of dupilumab through week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile 
observed at week 24. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for dupilumab overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic 
treatment immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding 
corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH05  
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 and 
interleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and 
both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). IL-4 and IL-13 are 
major drivers of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, PN, 
and EoE. Blocking the IL-4/IL-13 pathway with dupilumab in patients decreases many of the 
mediators of type 2 inflammation.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In atopic dermatitis clinical trials, treatment with dupilumab was associated with decreases from 
baseline in concentrations of type 2 immunity biomarkers, such as thymus and activation-regulated 
chemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE in serum. A reduction of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), a biomarker associated with AD disease activity and severity, was observed 
with dupilumab treatment in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. 
In adult and adolescent patients with asthma, dupilumab treatment relative to placebo markedly 
decreased FeNO and circulating concentrations of eotaxin-3, total IgE, allergen specific IgE, TARC, 
and periostin, the type 2 biomarkers evaluated in clinical trials. These reductions in type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers were comparable for the 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W regimens. In 
paediatric (6 to 11 years of age) patients with asthma, dupilumab treatment relative to placebo 
markedly decreased FeNO and circulating concentrations of total IgE, allergen specific IgE, and 
TARC, the type 2 biomarkers evaluated in clinical trials. These markers were near maximal 
suppression after 2 weeks of treatment, except for IgE which declined more slowly. These effects were 
sustained throughout treatment.

Clinical efficacy and safety in atopic dermatitis  
Adults with atopic dermatitis 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab as monotherapy and with concomitant topical corticosteroids 
were evaluated in three pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (SOLO 1, 
SOLO 2, and CHRONOS) in 2,119 patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis (AD) defined by Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3, an Eczema Area and 
Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10 %. 
Eligible patients enrolled into the three studies had previous inadequate response to topical medication. 
In all three studies, patients received dupilumab subcutaneous (SC) injections administered as 1) an 
initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg once every 
two weeks (Q2W); or 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab on day 1, followed by 300 mg once 
weekly (QW); or 3) matching placebo. If needed to control intolerable symptoms of atopic dermatitis, 
patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment (which included higher potency topical steroids or 
systemic immunosuppressants) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who received rescue 
treatment were considered non-responders. 
Endpoints 
In all three pivotal studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 
(“clear” or “almost clear”) with a reduction of ≥ 2 points on a 0-4 IGA scale and the proportion of 
patients with improvement of at least 75 % in EASI (EASI-75). Key secondary and other clinically 
relevant secondary endpoints are presented in Table 5. 
Baseline Characteristics 
In the monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2), across all treatment groups, the mean age was 
38.3, the mean weight was 76.9 kg, 42.1 % were female, 68.1 % were white, 21.8 % were Asian, and 
6.8 % were black. In these studies, 51.6 % of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), 
48.3 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe AD) and 32.4 % of patients had received prior 
systemic immunosuppressants. The baseline mean EASI score was 33.0, the baseline weekly averaged 
pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was 7.4, the baseline mean POEM score was 20.5, the baseline 
mean DLQI was 15.0, and the baseline mean HADS total score was 13.3. 
In the concomitant TCS study (CHRONOS), across all treatment groups, the mean age was 37.1, the 
mean weight was 74.5 kg, 39.7 % were female, 66.2 % were white, 27.2 % were Asian, and 4.6 % 
were black. In this study, 53.1 % of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3 and 46.9 % of patients had 
a baseline IGA of 4 and 33.6 % of patients received prior systemic immunosuppressants. The baseline 
mean EASI score was 32.5, the baseline weekly pruritus NRS was 7.3,  the baseline mean POEM score 
was 20.1, the baseline mean DLQI was 14.5, and the baseline mean HADS total score was 12.7. 
Clinical Response 
16-week monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) and 52-week concomitant TCS study 
(CHRONOS) 
In SOLO 1,SOLO 2, and CHRONOS from baseline to week 16, a significantly greater proportion of 
patients randomised to dupilumab achieved an IGA 0 or 1 response, EASI-75, and/or an improvement 
of > 4 points on the pruritus NRS (key secondary endpoint) compared to placebo (see Table 5). 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab alone or with TCS achieved a 
rapid improvement in the pruritus NRS compared to placebo or placebo + TCS ( defined as ≥ 4-point 
improvement as early as week 2, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). 
A persistent treatment effect of dupilumab was observed in the CHRONOS study up to week 52 (see 
Table 6).

Clinical response in patients not adequately controlled with, intolerant to, or for whom ciclosporin 
treatment was inadvisable (CAFE study) 
CAFE study evaluated the efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo during a 16-week treatment 
period, administered with concomitant TCS, in adult patients with AD who are not adequately 
controlled with, or are intolerant to, oral ciclosporin, or when this treatment is currently 
contraindicated or not medically advisable. 
A total of 325 patients were enrolled, with 210 patients who were previously exposed to ciclosporin 
and 115 patients who have never been exposed to ciclosporin because ciclosporin treatment was 
medically inadvisable. The mean age was 38.4 years, 38.8 % were female, the baseline mean EASI 
score was 33.1, the mean BSA was 55.7, the baseline weekly average pruritis NRS was 6.4, and the 
baseline mean DLQI was 13.8. 
Primary endpoint (proportion of patients with EASI-75) and secondary endpoints for the 16 week 
CAFE study are summarized in Table 7.

In the subgroup of patients resembling the CAFE study population within the 52 week CHRONOS 
study, 69.6 % of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W-treated patients reached EASI-75 vs 18.0 % placebo-treated 
patients at week 16, and 52.4 % of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W-treated vs 18.6 % placebo-treated at 
week 52. In this subset, the percent change of pruritus NRS from baseline was -51.4 % vs -30.2 % at 
week 16 and -54.8 % vs -30.9 % at week 52, for the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups 
respectively. 
Maintenance and durability of response (SOLO CONTINUE study) 
To evaluate maintenance and durability of response, subjects treated with dupilumab for 16 weeks in 
SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies who achieved IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 were re-randomised in SOLO 
CONTINUE study to an additional 36-week treatment of dupilumab or placebo, for a cumulative 52-
week study treatment. Endpoints were assessed at weeks 51 or 52. 
The co-primary endpoints were the difference between baseline (week 0) and week 36 in percent 
change in EASI from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies baseline and percentage of patients with EASI-75 
at week 36 in patients with EASI-75 at baseline. 
Patients who continued on the same dose regimen received in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies (300 
mg Q2W or 300 mg QW) showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for 
other dose regimens diminished in a dose-dependent manner. 
Primary and secondary endpoints for the 52 week SOLO CONTINUE study are summarized in

In SOLO CONTINUE, a trend for increased treatment-emergent ADA positivity with increased dosing 
intervals was observed. Treatment-emergent ADA: QW: 1.2 %; Q2W: 4.3 %; Q4W: 6.0 %; Q8W: 
11.7 %. ADA responses lasting more than 12 weeks: QW: 0.0 %; Q2W: 1.4 %; Q4W: 0.0 %; Q8W:

Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes in atopic dermatitis 
In both monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2), both dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW 
groups significantly improved patient-reported symptoms and the impact of AD on sleep, anxiety and 
depression symptoms as measured by HADS, and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM 
and DLQI total scores, respectively, at 16 weeks compared to placebo (see Table 9). 
Similarly, in the concomitant TCS study (CHRONOS), dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS and 
dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS improved patient-reported symptoms and the impact of AD on sleep 
and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM and DLQI total scores, respectively, at 52 
weeks compared to placebo + TCS (see Table 9).

Adolescents with atopic dermatitis (12 to 17 years of age) 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  dupilumab  monotherapy  in  adolescent  patients was  evaluated  in  a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1526) in 251 adolescent 
patients  12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) defined by 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a 
severity scale of 0 to 4, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16 on a scale of 0 to 
72, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement  of ≥10 %.  Eligible patients enrolled 
into this study had previous inadequate response to topical medication. 
Patients received dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injections either as:1) an 
initial dose of 400 mg dupilumab (two 200 mg injections) on day 1, followed by  200 mg once 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
every other week (Q2W) for patients with baseline weight of < 60 kg or an initial dose of  600 mg 
dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W for patients with baseline 
weight of ≥ 60 kg; or 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, 
followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) regardless of baseline body weight; or 3) matching 
placebo. If needed to control intolerable symptoms,  patients were permitted to receive rescue 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who  received rescue treatment were 
considered non-responders. 
In this study, the mean age was 14.5 years, the median weight was 59.4 kg, 41.0 % were female, 
62.5 % were White, 15.1 % were Asian, and 12.0 % were Black. At baseline 46.2 % of patients 
had a  baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), 53.8 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe 
AD), the  mean BSA involvement was 56.5 %, and 42.4 % of patients had received prior systemic 
immunosuppressants. Also at baseline the mean Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score 
was  35.5, the baseline weekly averaged pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was 7.6,  the 
baseline mean Patient Oriented Eczema  Measure (POEM) score was 21.0, and the baseline mean 
Children Dermatology Life Quality Index  (CDLQI) was 13.6. Overall, 92.0 % of patients had at 
least one co-morbid allergic condition; 65.6 %  had allergic rhinitis, 53.6 % had asthma, and 
60.8 % had food allergies. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost 
clear”)  least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement 
of at least  75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16.

A larger percentage of patients randomised to placebo needed rescue treatment (topical corticosteroids, 
systemic corticosteroids, or systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants) as compared to the 
dupilumab group (58.8 % and 20.7 %, respectively). 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab achieved a rapid improvement 
in the pruritus NRS compared to placebo (defined as ≥ 4-point improvement as early as week 4; 
nominal p< 0.001) and the proportion of patients responding on the pruritus NRS continued to increase 
through the treatment period. 
The dupilumab group significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, the impact of AD on sleep 
and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM and CDLQI scores at 16 weeks compared to 
placebo. 
The long-term efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had 
participated in previous clinical trials of dupilumab was assessed in open-label extension study (AD-
1434). Efficacy data from this study suggests that clinical benefit provided at week 16 was sustained 
through week 52. 
Paediatrics (6 to 11 years of age) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients concomitantly with TCS was evaluated in a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1652) in 367 subjects 6 to 11 
years of age, with severe AD defined by an IGA score of 4 (scale of 0 to 4), an EASI score ≥ 21 (scale 
of 0 to 72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 15 %. Eligible patients enrolled into this trial had 
previous inadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (< 30 
kg; ≥ 30 kg). 
Patients in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group with baseline weight of < 30 kg received an initial dose 
of 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 100 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14, and patients with baseline 
weight of ≥ 30 kg received an initial dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W from week 2 
to week 14. Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group received an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, 
followed by 300 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, regardless of weight. 
In this study, the mean age was 8.5 years, the median weight was 29.8 kg, 50.1 % of patients were 
female, 69.2 % were White, 16.9 % were Black, and 7.6 % were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA 
involvement was 57.6 %, and 16.9 % had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. 
Also, at baseline the mean EASI score was 37.9, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was 
7.8 on a scale of 0-10, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 73.6, the baseline POEM score was 
20.9, and the baseline mean CDLQI was 15.1. Overall, 91.7 % of subjects had at least one co-morbid 
allergic condition; 64.4 % had food allergies, 62.7 % had other allergies, 60.2 % had allergic rhinitis, 
and 46.7 % had asthma. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) at 
least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least 
75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16.

A greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab + TCS achieved an improvement in the peak 
pruritus NRS compared to placebo + TCS (defined as ≥4-point improvement at week 4).  
The dupilumab groups significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, the impact of AD on sleep 
and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM and CDLQI scores at 16 weeks compared to 
placebo. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis who had participated in the previous clinical trials of dupilumab + TCS was assessed 
in an open-label extension study (AD-1434). Efficacy data from this trial suggests that clinical benefit 
provided at week 16 was sustained through week 52. Some patients receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q4W 
+ TCS showed further clinical benefit when escalated to dupilumab 200 mg Q2W + TCS. The safety 
profile of dupilumab in patients followed through week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at 
week 16 in the AD-1526 and AD-1652 studies. 
Paediatrics (6 Months to 5 years of age) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients was evaluated in a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1539) in 162 patients 6 months to 5 years of 
age, with moderate-to-severe AD (ITT population) defined by an IGA score ≥ 3 (scale of 0 to 4), an 
EASI score ≥ 16 (scale of 0 to 72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 10. Of the 162 patients, 125 
patients had severe AD defined by an IGA score of 4. Eligible patients enrolled into this study had 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous inadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (≥ 5 
to < 15 kg and ≥ 15 to < 30 kg). 
Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group with baseline weight of ≥ 5 to < 15 kg received an initial 
dose of 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, and patients with 
baseline weight of ≥ 15 to < 30 kg received an initial dose of 300 mg on Day 1, followed by 300 mg 
Q4W from week 4 to week 12. Patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator. Patients who received rescue treatment were considered non-responders. 
In AD-1539, the mean age was 3.8 years, the median weight was 16.5 kg, 38.9% of patients were 
female, 68.5% were White, 18.5% were Black, and 6.2% were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA 
involvement was 58.4%, and 15.5% had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. 
Also, at baseline the mean EASI score was 34.1, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was 
7.6 on a scale of 0-10. Overall, 81.4% of patients had at least one co-morbid allergic condition; 68.3% 
had food allergies, 52.8% had other allergies, 44.1% had allergic rhinitis, and 25.5% had asthma. 
These baseline disease characteristics were comparable between moderate-to-severe and severe AD 
populations. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”, at 
least a 2-point improvement) and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least 
75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an 
IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at week 16.

*Caregiver reported outcome 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab + TCS achieved a rapid 
improvement in the Worst Scratch/Itch NRS compared to placebo + TCS (defined as ≥ 4-point 
improvement as early as week 3, nominal p< 0.005) and the proportion of patients responding on the 
Worst Scratch/Itch NRS continued to increase through the treatment period.  
In this study, dupilumab significantly improved health-related quality of life as measured by the 
CDLQI (in 85 patients 4 to 5 years old) and IDQOL (in 77 patients 6 months to 3 years old). In the 
ITT population, greater LS mean changes in CDLQI and IDQOL scores from baseline to week 16 
were observed in the dupilumab + TCS (-10.0 and -10.9) group compared to the placebo + TCS group 
(-2.5 and -2.0), respectively (p< 0.0001). Similar improvements in both CDLQI and IDQOL were 
observed in the severe AD population. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis who had participated in the previous clinical trials of dupilumab + TCS were 
assessed in an open-label extension study (AD-1434). Efficacy data from this trial suggest that clinical 
benefit provided at week 16 was sustained through week 52. The safety profile of dupilumab in 
patients followed through week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at week 16 in the AD- 
1539 study. 
Atopic Hand and Foot Dermatitis (adults and adolescents) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab was evaluated in a 16-week multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (AD-1924) in 133 adult and paediatric patients 12 to 17 
years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis, defined by an IGA (hand and 
foot) score ≥3 (scale of 0 to 4) and a hand and foot Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score 
for maximum itch intensity ≥4 (scale of 0 to 10). Eligible patients had previous inadequate response or 
intolerance to treatment of hand and foot dermatitis with topical AD medications. 
In AD-1924, 38% of patients were male, 80% were White, 72% of subjects had a baseline IGA (hand 
and foot) score of 3 (moderate atopic hand and foot dermatitis), and 28% of patients had a baseline 
IGA (hand and foot) score of 4 (severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis). The baseline weekly averaged 
hand and foot Peak Pruritus NRS score was 7.1.  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an IGA hand and foot score of 0 (clear) or 1 
(almost clear) at Week 16. The key secondary endpoint was reduction of itch as measured by the hand 
and foot Peak Pruritus NRS (≥4-point improvement). Other patient reported outcomes included 
assessment of hand and foot skin pain NRS (0-10), quality of sleep NRS (0-10), quality of life in Hand 
Eczema Questionnaire (0-117) (QoLHEQ) and work productivity and impairment (WPAI) (0-100%).  
The proportion of patients with an IGA (hand and foot) 0 to 1 at Week 16 was 40.3% for dupilumab 
and 16.7% for placebo (treatment difference 23.6, 95% CI: 8.84, 38.42). The proportion of patients 
with improvement (reduction) of weekly averaged hand and foot Peak Pruritus NRS ≥4 at Week 16 
was 52.2% for dupilumab and 13.6% for placebo (treatment difference 38.6, 95% CI: 24.06, 53.15).  
26 
 
 
 
 
Greater improvements for hand and foot skin pain NRS, quality of sleep NRS, QoLHEQ score and 
WPAI overall work impairment and routine activity impairment from baseline to week 16 were seen in 
the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (LS mean change of dupilumab vs placebo: -
4.66 vs -1.93 [p < 0.0001], 0.88 vs -0.00 [p < 0.05], -40.28 vs -16.18 [p < 0.0001], -38.57% vs -
22.83% [nominal p<0.001] and -36.39% vs -21.26% [nominal p < 0.001] respectively). 
Clinical efficacy and safety in asthma  
The asthma development program included three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multi-centre studies (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE) of 24 to 52 weeks in 
treatment duration which enrolled a total of 2,888 patients (12 years of age and older). Patients were 
enrolled without requiring a minimum baseline blood eosinophil or other type 2 inflammatory 
biomarkers (e.g. FeNO or IgE) level. Asthma treatment guidelines define type 2 inflammation as 
eosinophilia ≥ 150 cells/mcL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the pre-specified 
subgroup analyses included blood eosinophils ≥ 150 and ≥ 300 cells/mcL, FeNO ≥ 25 and ≥ 50 ppb.  
DRI12544 was a 24-week dose-ranging study which included 776 patients (18 years of age and older). 
Dupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma on 
a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist. The primary endpoint 
was change from baseline to week 12 in FEV1 (L). Annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbation 
events during the 24-week placebo controlled treatment period was also determined. Results were 
evaluated in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count. 
QUEST was a 52-week confirmatory study which included 1,902 patients (12 years of age and older). 
Dupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 adolescent and 1,795 adult patients with 
persistent asthma on a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a second controller 
medication. Patients requiring a third controller were allowed to participate in this trial. The primary 
endpoints were the annualised rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week placebo 
controlled period and change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 in the overall 
population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) 
and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO.  
VENTURE was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 patients with asthma unrestricted 
by baseline type 2 biomarker levels who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of 
high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. The OCS dose was optimized during 
the screening period. Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the study; 
however their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase (week 4-20), as 
long as asthma control was maintained. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in oral 
corticosteroid dose assessed in the overall population, based on a comparison of the oral corticosteroid 
dose at weeks 20 to 24 that maintained asthma control with the previously optimized (at baseline) oral 
corticosteroid dose. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 studies are provided in Table 13 below.

Exacerbations 
In the overall population in DRI12544 and QUEST subjects receiving either dupilumab 200 mg or 
300 mg every other week had significant reductions in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
compared to placebo. There were greater reductions in exacerbations in subjects with higher baseline 
levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as blood eosinophils or FeNO (Table 14 and Table 15).

In the pooled analysis of DRI12544 and QUEST, hospitalisations and/or emergency room visits due to 
severe exacerbations were reduced by 25.5 % and 46.9 % with dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 
other week, respectively. 
Lung function 
Clinically significant increases in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at week 12 for DRI12544 
and QUEST. There were greater improvements in FEV1 in the subjects with higher baseline levels of 
type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as blood eosinophils or FeNO (Table 16 and Table 17). 
Significant improvements in FEV1 were observed as early as week 2 following the first dose of 
dupilumab for both the 200 mg and 300 mg dose strengths and were maintained through week 24 
(DRI12544) and week 52 in QUEST (see Figure 3).

(DRI12544 and VENTURE) and at 52 weeks (QUEST, Table 18). The responder rate was defined as 
an improvement in score of 0.5 or more (scale range 0-6 for ACQ-5 and 1-7 for AQLQ(S)). 
Improvements in ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) were observed as early as week 2 and maintained for 24 
weeks in DRI12544 study and 52 weeks in QUEST study. Similar results were observed in 
VENTURE.

VENTURE evaluated the effect of dupilumab on reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids. 
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 13. All patients were on oral corticosteroids for at least 
6 months prior to the study initiation. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was 11.75 mg in the 
placebo group and 10.75 mg in the group receiving dupilumab. 
In this 24-week trial, asthma exacerbations (defined as a temporary increase in oral corticosteroid dose 
for at least 3 days) were reduced by 59 % in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those 
receiving placebo (annualised rate 0.65 and 1.60 for the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively; 
rate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.26, 0.63]) and improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to 
week 24 was greater in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those receiving placebo (LS mean 
difference for dupilumab versus placebo of 0.22 L [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34 L]). Effects on lung function, 
on oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers (e.g. blood eosinophils, FeNO). The ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) were also 
assessed in VENTURE and showed improvements similar to those in QUEST.

Long-term extension study (TRAVERSE) 
The long-term safety of dupilumab in 2,193 adults and 89 adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma, 
including 185 adults with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, who had participated in previous 
clinical trials of dupilumab (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE), was assessed in the open-label 
extension study (TRAVERSE) (see section 4.8). Efficacy was measured as a secondary endpoint, was 
similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. In the adults with 
oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma, there was sustained reduction in exacerbations and improvement 
in lung function up to 96 weeks, despite decrease or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid dose. 
Paediatric study (6 to 11 years of age; VOYAGE) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients was evaluated in a 52-week multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (VOYAGE) in 408 patients 6 to 11 years of age, 
with moderate-to-severe asthma on a medium- or high- dose ICS and one controller medication or high 
dose ICS alone. Patients were randomised to dupilumab (N=273) or matching placebo (N=135) every 
other week based on body weight ≤ 30 kg or > 30 kg, respectively. The efficacy was evaluated in

populations with type 2 inflammation defined as blood eosinophil levels of ≥ 150 cells/mcL or FeNO 
≥ 20 ppb. 
The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week 
placebo-controlled period and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted at week 12. Additional secondary endpoints included mean 
change from baseline and responder rates in the ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA scores.

Dupilumab significantly reduced the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 
52-week treatment period compared to placebo in the population with the type 2 inflammation and in 
population defined by baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL or by baseline FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. 
Clinically significant improvements in percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at

week 12. Improvements were also observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA at week 24 and were 
sustained at week 52. Greater responder rates were observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA 
compared to placebo at week 24. The efficacy results for VOYAGE are presented in Table 21. 
In the population with the type 2 inflammation, the LS mean change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 0.12 L in the placebo group, 
with an LS mean difference versus placebo of 0.10 L (95% CI: 0.04, 0.16). The treatment effect was 
sustained over the 52-week treatment period, with an LS mean difference versus placebo at week 52 of 
0.17 L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.24). 
In the population defined by baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL, the LS mean change from 
baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 0.12 L in the 
placebo group, with an LS mean difference versus placebo of 0.10 L (95% CI: 0.03, 0.17). The 
treatment effect was sustained over the 52-week treatment period, with an LS mean difference versus 
placebo at week 52 of 0.17 L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.26). 
In both primary efficacy populations, there was a rapid improvement in FEF25-75% and FEV1/FVC 
(onset of a difference was observed as early as week 2) and sustained over the 52-week treatment 
period, see Table 21.

In VOYAGE, in the population with the type 2 inflammation, the mean annualised total number of 
systemic corticosteroid courses due to asthma was reduced by 59.3% versus placebo (0.350 [95% CI: 
0.256, 0.477] versus 0.860 [95% CI: 0.616, 1.200]). In the population defined by baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL, the mean annualised total number of systemic corticosteroid courses due 
to asthma was reduced by 66.0% versus placebo (0.274 [95% CI: 0.188, 0.399] versus 0.806 [95% CI: 
0.563, 1.154]). 
Dupilumab improved the overall health status as measured by the European Quality of Life 5-
Dimension Youth Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) in both the type 2 inflammation and the baseline 
blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mcL populations at week 52; the LS mean difference versus 
placebo was 4.73 (95% CI: 1.18, 8.28), and 3.38 (95% CI: -0.66, 7.43), respectively. 
Dupilumab reduced the impact of paediatric patient’s asthma on the caregiver quality of life as 
measured by the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) in both the type 2 
inflammation and the baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mcL population at week 52; the 
LS mean difference versus placebo was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.72), and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.79), 
respectively. 
Long-term extension study (EXCURSION) 
The efficacy of dupilumab, measured as a secondary endpoint, was assessed in 365 paediatric asthma 
patients (6 to 11 years of age) in the long-term extension study (EXCURSION). There were sustained 
reductions in exacerbations requiring hospitalization and/or emergency room visits and a reduction in 
exposure to systemic oral corticosteroids. Sustained improvements in lung function were observed 
across multiple parameters including percent predicted FEV1, percent predicted FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio 
and percent predicted FEF 25-75%. Furthermore, 75% of patients achieved and/or maintained normal 
lung function with pre-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 > 80% by the end of EXCURSION. 
Efficacy was sustained for a cumulative treatment duration of up to 104 weeks (VOYAGE and 
EXCURSION). 
Clinical efficacy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) 
The chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) development program included two 
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies (SINUS-24 and 
SINUS-52) in 724 patients aged 18 years and older on background intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). 
These studies included patients with severe CRSwNP despite prior sino-nasal surgery or treatment 
with, or who were ineligible to receive, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years. Rescue with 
systemic corticosteroids or surgery was allowed during the studies at the investigator’s discretion All 
patients had evidence of sinus opacification on the Lund MacKay (LMK) sinus CT scan and 73 % to 
90 % of patients had opacification of all sinuses. Patients were stratified based on their histories of 
prior surgery and co-morbid asthma/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory 
disease (NSAID-ERD). 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to week 24 in bilateral endoscopic nasal 
polyps score (NPS) as graded by central blinded readers, and change from baseline to week 24 in nasal 
congestion/obstruction score averaged over 28 days (NC), as determined by patients using a daily 
diary. For NPS, polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale (0=no polyps; 
1=small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 
2=polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3=large polyps reaching the lower 
border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4=large polyps causing 
complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity). The total score was the sum of the right and left 
scores. Nasal congestion was rated daily by the subjects on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0=no 
symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 2 studies are provided in Table 22 below.

Statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy was observed in SINUS-24 with regard to 
improvement in bilateral endoscopic NPS score at week 24. In the post-treatment period when patients 
were off dupilumab, the treatment effect diminished over time (see Figure 5a). Similar results were 
also seen in SINUS-52 at both week 24 and week 52 with a progressive improvement over time (see 
Figure 5b).

In both studies, significant improvements in NC and daily loss of smell severity were observed as 
early as the first assessment at week 4. The LS mean difference for NC at week 4 in the dupilumab 
group versus placebo was -0.41 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.30) in SINUS-24 and -0.37 (95% CI: -0.46, -0.27) 
in SINUS-52. The LS mean difference for loss of smell at week 4 in the dupilumab group versus 
placebo was -0.34 (95% CI: -0.44, -0.25) in SINUS-24 and -0.31 (95% CI: -0.41, -0.22) in SINUS-52. 
A reduction in the proportion of patients with anosmia was observed in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52. At 
baseline, 74 % to 79 % of patients had anosmia, which was reduced to 24 % in SINUS-24 and 30 % in 
SINUS-52 at week 24, compared to no change in placebo. Improvement in nasal peak inspiratory flow 
(NPIF) was observed in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 at week 24. The LS mean difference in the 
dupilumab group versus placebo was 40.4 L/min (95% CI: 30.4, 50.4) and 36.6 L/min (95% CI: 28.0, 
45.3), respectively. 
Among the patients with rhinosinusitis VAS score > 7 at baseline, a higher percentage of patients 
achieved VAS ≤ 7 in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (83.3 % versus 39.4 % in 
SINUS-24 and 75.0 % versus 39.3 % in SINUS-52) at week 24. 
In the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted pooled analysis of two studies, treatment with dupilumab 
resulted in significant reduction of systemic corticosteroid use and need for sino-nasal surgery versus 
placebo (HR of 0.24; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.35) (see Figure 6). The proportion of patients who required 
systemic corticosteroids was reduced by 74 % (HR of 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.38). The total number of 
systemic corticosteroid courses per year was reduced by 75 % (RR of 0.25; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.37). The 
mean individual annualised prescribed total dose of systemic corticosteroids (in mg) during the 
treatment period was 71 % lower in the pooled dupilumab group compared with the pooled placebo 
group (60.5 [531.3] mg versus 209.5 [497.2] mg, respectively). The proportion of patients who 
required surgery was reduced by 83 % (HR of 0.17; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.46).

surgery during treatment period - ITT population [SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 pooled] 
The effects of dupilumab on the primary endpoints of NPS and nasal congestion and the key secondary 
endpoint of LMK sinus CT scan score were consistent in patients with prior surgery and without prior 
surgery. 
In patients with co-morbid asthma, significant improvements in FEV1 and ACQ-6 were observed at 
week 24 irrespective of baseline blood eosinophil levels. The pooled LS Mean change from baseline in 
FEV1 at week 24 for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W was 0.14 vs -0.07 L for placebo, for a difference of 0.21 
L (95% CI: 0.13, 0.29). In addition, improvements in FEV1 were noted from the first post-baseline 
assessment, at week 8 in SINUS-24 and week 4 in SINUS-52. Improvements in ACQ-6 in patients 
with co-morbid asthma were observed in both studies. A response was defined as an improvement in 
score of 0.5 or more. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo at week 24 was 
-0.76 (95% CI: -1.00 to -0.51) in SINUS-24 and -0.94 (95% CI: -1.19, -0.69) in SINUS-52.

The ACQ-6 responder rate for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W for SINUS-24 at week 24 was 56 % versus 
28 % in placebo (odds ratio 3.17; 95% CI: 1.65, 6.09). The ACQ-6 responder rate for dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W for SINUS-52 was 46 % versus 14 % placebo at week 52 (odds ratio 7.02; 95% CI: 3.10, 
15.90). 
In patients with NSAID-ERD, the effects of dupilumab on the primary endpoints of NPS and NC and 
the key secondary endpoint of LMK sinus CT scan score were consistent with that observed in the 
overall CRSwNP population. 
Clinical efficacy in prurigo nodularis (PN) 
The prurigo nodularis (PN) development program included two 24-week randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group studies (PRIME and PRIME2) in 311 patients 18 years 
of age and older with moderate to severe PN, defined as severe pruritus (WI-NRS ≥ 7 on a scale of 0 
to 10) and greater than or equal to 20 nodular lesions, whose disease was not adequately controlled 
with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies were not advisable. PRIME and PRIME2 
assessed the effect of dupilumab on itch improvement as well as its effect on PN lesions, Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (DLQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and skin pain.  
In these two studies, patients received either subcutaneous dupilumab 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) 
on day 1, followed by 300 mg once every other week (Q2W) for 24 weeks, or matching placebo. 
In these studies, the mean age was 49.5 years, the median weight was 71.3 kg, 65.3% of patients were 
female, 56.6% were White, 6.1% were Black, and 34.1% were Asian. At baseline, the mean WI-NRS 
was 8.5, 66.3% had 20 to 100 nodules (moderate), 33.7% had greater than 100 nodules (severe), 99.7% 
received prior topical therapies, 12.5% received prior systemic corticosteroids, 20.6% received prior 
systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants, and 4.5% prior gabapentinoids. Eleven percent of 
patients were taking stable doses of antidepressants at baseline and were instructed to continue taking 
these medications during the study. 43.4 % had history of atopy (defined as having a medical history 
of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy). 
The WI-NRS is comprised of a single item, rated on a scale from 0 (“no itch”) to 10 (“worst 
imaginable itch”). Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their worst pruritus (itch) over the 
past 24 hours using this scale. The IGA PN-S is a scale that measures the approximate number of 
nodules using a 5-point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) in 
WI-NRS by ≥4. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants with IGA PN-S 0 or 
1 (the equivalent of 0-5 nodules).  
The efficacy results for PRIME and PRIME2 are presented in Table 25 and Figures 7 and 8.

The onset of action in change from baseline in WI-NRS, defined as the first timepoint at which 
difference from placebo was and remained significant (nominal p<0.05) in the weekly average of daily 
WI-NRS, was observed as early as Week 3 in PRIME (Figure 7a) and Week 4 in PRIME2 (Figure7b).

A greater proportion of patients experienced WI-NRS improvements of ≥4 points from baseline by 
Weeks 4 and 11 in the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group in PRIME (Figure 8a 
nominal p<0.007) and PRIME2 (Figure 8b nominal p<0.013), respectively, and this difference 
remained significant throughout the treatment period.

Treatment effects in subgroups (age, gender, with or without medical history of atopy, and background 
treatment, including immunosuppressants) in PRIME and PRIME2 were consistent with the results in 
the overall study population. 
Once treatment was discontinued after 24 weeks, there was an indication towards recurrence of signs 
and symptoms within the 12-week follow-up period. 
Clinical efficacy in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) 
The eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) development program included a three-part protocol (TREET) 
consisting of two separately randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre, placebo-controlled, 
24-week treatment studies (TREET Part A and TREET Part B) in adult and paediatric patients 12 to 17 
years of age, excluding patients <40 kg. In TREET Parts A and B, all enrolled patients had to have 
failed conventional medicinal therapy (proton pump inhibitors), 74% were treated with another 
conventional medicinal therapy (swallowed topical corticosteroids) prior to inclusion. In TREET Part 
B, 49% of patients were inadequately controlled, intolerant or contraindicated to swallowed topical 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corticosteroid treatment. In both parts, patients were required to have ≥15 intraepithelial eosinophils 
per high-power field (eos/hpf) following an at least 8-week course of a high-dose proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI) either prior to or during the screening period and a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire 
(DSQ) score ≥10 on a scale of 0 to 84. Patients were stratified based on age at the time of the 
screening visit (12 to 17 years of age vs. 18 years and older) and use of PPI at randomisation. TREET 
Part A was conducted first. TREET Part B opened after enrollment into TREET Part A was complete. 
Patients completing the 24 weeks of the double-blind treatment period in Parts A or B were provided 
an option to enroll in a 28-week active treatment extension study (TREET Part C). 
In Part A, a total of 81 patients, of which 61 were adults and 20 were paediatric patients 12 to 17 years 
of age, were randomised to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=42) or placebo (N=39). 
In Part B, a total of 240 patients, of which 161 were adults and 79 were paediatric patients 12 to 17 
years of age, were randomised to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=80), 300 mg 
dupilumab every other week (N=81; the 300 mg every other week dosage regimen is not approved for 
EoE) or placebo (N=79). In Part C, all patients who previously participated in Part A received 300 mg 
dupilumab (N=77) every week. Of the patients who previously participated in Part B, 111 received 
dupilumab 300 mg every week in Part C. Rescue with systemic and/or swallowed topical 
corticosteroids or emergency esophageal dilation was allowed during the study at the investigator’s 
discretion. 
In Part A, a total of 74.1% of patients enrolled had a history of prior use of swallowed topical 
corticosteroids for the treatment of EoE and 43.2% had a history of prior esophageal dilation. In Part 
B, a total of 73.3% of patients enrolled had a history of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids 
for the treatment of EoE and 35.4% had a history of prior esophageal dilation. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials were the proportion of patients achieving histological 
remission defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 and the 
absolute change in the patient-reported DSQ score from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints 
included change from baseline in the following: percent change in peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count (eos/hpf), absolute change in Mean Grade Score from the Histology Scoring System 
(EoEHSS), absolute change in Mean Stage Score from the EoEHSS, absolute change in EoE-
Endoscopic Reference Score (EoE-EREFS), and proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count of <15 eos/hpf.

The efficacy results for co-primary and key secondary endpoints in prior swallowed topical 
corticosteroids subgroup and in patients who were inadequately controlled, intolerant or 
contraindicated to swallowed topical corticosteroids were consistent with the overall population. 
In Parts A and B, a greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab achieved histological 
remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf) compared to placebo. The 
proportion of patients with histological remission observed after 24 weeks of treatment in Part A and B 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was maintained for 52 weeks in Part C. Similarly, other histological and endoscopic improvement 
were maintained through 52 weeks. 
Treatment with dupilumab also resulted in a significant improvement in LS mean change in DSQ score 
compared to placebo as early as week 4 and were maintained through week 24. Efficacy in part C was 
similar to results observed in Parts A and B, with a continuous improvement for DSQ up to 52 weeks 
(TREET  Part A and C Figure 9 and TREET Parts B and C Figure 10).

older with EoE (TREET Part A and C) 
Figure 10: Mean change from baseline in DSQ score over time in patients 12 years of age and 
older with EoE (TREET Parts B and C) 
Consistent with improvement in DSQ total score in TREET Parts A and B, nominally significant 
improvements were observed at week 24 compared to placebo in pain related to dysphagia (DSQ pain 
score), health-related QoL (EoE-IQ), and the frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE-SQ).

Paediatric population 
Atopic dermatitis  
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab have been established in paediatric patients 6 months of age and 
older with atopic dermatitis. Use of dupilumab in this age group is supported by study AD-1526 which 
included 251 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,  in study 
AD-1652 which included 367 paediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years old with severe atopic dermatitis, 
and study AD-1539 which included 162 children ages 6 months to 5 years old with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis (125 of whom had severe atopic dermatitis). Long term use is supported by study 
AD-1434 which enrolled 823 paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years of age, this included 275 
adolescents, 368 children 6 to 11 years of age, and 180 children 6 months to 5 years of age. The safety 
and efficacy were generally consistent between children 6 months to 5 years old, 6 to 11 years old, 
adolescent (12 to 17 years old), and adult patients with atopic dermatitis (see section 4.8). Safety and 
efficacy in paediatric patients < 6 months of age with atopic dermatitis have not been established. 
Asthma 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled in 
QUEST study and received either 200 mg (N=21) or 300 mg (N=18) dupilumab (or matching placebo 
either 200 mg [N=34] or 300 mg [N=34]) every other week. Efficacy with respect to severe asthma 
exacerbations and lung function was observed in both adolescents and adults. For both the 200 mg and 
300 mg every other week doses, significant improvements in FEV1 (LS mean change from baseline at 
week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg every other week dose, 
patients had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. The safety 
profile in adolescents was generally similar to the adults. 
A total of 89 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in the 
open label long-term study (TRAVERSE). In this study, efficacy was measured as a secondary 
endpoint, was similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. 
A total of 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma was enrolled in the 
VOYAGE study, which evaluated doses of 100 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W. The efficacy of 
dupilumab 300 mg Q4W in children aged 6 to 11 years is extrapolated from the efficacy of 100 mg 
and 200 mg Q2W in VOYAGE and 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W in adults and adolescents (QUEST). 
Patients who completed the treatment period of the VOYAGE study could participate in the open label 
extension study (EXCURSION). Eighteen patients (≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg) out of 365 patients were 
exposed to 300 mg Q4W in this study, and the safety profile was similar to that seen in VOYAGE. 
Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients < 6 years of age with asthma have not been established. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
dupilumab in one or more subset of the paediatric population in asthma and EoE (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit 
the results of studies with dupilumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of 
nasal polyposis and prurigo nodularis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). Obligations 
related to the paediatric investigation plans for atopic dermatitis have been fulfilled. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab is similar in patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, PN 
and EoE. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
After a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 75-600 mg dupilumab to adults, median times to maximum 
concentration in serum (tmax) were 3-7 days. The absolute bioavailability of dupilumab following a SC 
dose is similar between AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and EoE patients, ranging between 61 % and 64 %, as 
determined by a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. 
Steady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting 
dose and 300 mg dose every other week or 300 mg dose every other week without a loading dose. 
Across clinical trials, the mean ±SD steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 
60.3±35.1 mcg/mL to 81.5±43.9 mcg/mL for 300 mg administered Q2W, from 172±76.6 mcg/ml to 
195±71.7 mcg/ml for 300 mg administered weekly, and from 29.2±18.7 to 36.5±22.2 mcg/mL 
for 200 mg administered Q2W. 
Distribution 
A volume of distribution for dupilumab of approximately 4.6 L was estimated by population PK 
analysis, indicating that dupilumab is distributed primarily in the vascular system. 
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because dupilumab is a protein. Dupilumab is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
Dupilumab elimination is mediated by parallel linear and nonlinear pathways. At higher 
concentrations, dupilumab elimination is primarily through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while 
at lower concentrations, the non-linear saturable IL-4R α target-mediated elimination predominates. 
After the last steady state dose of 300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, or 200 mg 
Q4W dupilumab, the median times to decrease below the lower limit of detection, estimated by 
population PK analysis, ranged from 9-13 weeks in adults and adolescents and are approximately 1.5 
times and 2.5 times longer in paediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age and paediatric patients less than 6 
years of age, respectively . 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Due to nonlinear clearance, dupilumab exposure, as measured by area under the concentration-time 
curve, increases with dose in a greater than proportional manner following single SC doses from 75-
600 mg. 
Special populations 
Gender 
Gender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure 
of dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. 
Elderly 
Of the 1,539 patients with atopic dermatitis, including patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis 
exposed to dupilumab in a phase 2 dose-ranging study or phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 
71 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older 
and younger adult atopic dermatitis patients, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient 
to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 
Age was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of 
dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. However, there were only 61 patients over 65 years 
of age included in this analysis. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 1,977 patients with asthma exposed to dupilumab, a total of 240 patients were 65 years or older 
and 39 patients were 75 years or older. Efficacy and safety in this age group were similar to the overall 
study population. 
There were only 79 patients older than 65 years with CRSwNP exposed to dupilumab among them 11 
patients were 75 years and older. 
Of the 152 patients with PN exposed to dupilumab, a total of 37 were 65 years of age or older. A total 
of 8 patients were 75 years of age or older. Efficacy and safety in these age groups were similar to the 
overall study population. 
There were only 2 patients older than 65 years with EoE exposed to dupilumab. 
Race 
Race was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure 
of dupilumab by population PK analysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. 
Renal impairment 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal 
impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of dupilumab. Very 
limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Body weight 
Dupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight with no meaningful 
impact on efficacy. There were only 6 patients exposed to dupilumab with body weight ≥130 kg in 
CRSwNP clinical studies. 
Paediatric population 
Atopic dermatitis 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age did not affect dupilumab clearance in adults and in 
paediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. In paediatric patients from 6 months to 5 years of age, 
clearance increased with age but is accommodated in the recommended dose regimen. 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 months of age) or body weight < 5 kg 
with atopic dermatitis has not been studied. 
For adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every other week dosing (Q2W) 
with either 200 mg (< 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean ±SD steady state trough concentration of 
dupilumab was 54.5±27.0 mcg/mL. 
For children 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing (Q4W) with 
300 mg (≥ 15 kg) in AD-1652, the mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 76.3±37.2 
mcg/mL. At week 16 in AD-1434 in children 6 to 11 years of age who initiated every four week 
dosing (Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 kg), and whose dose was increased to every other week dosing 
(Q2W) with 200 mg (≥ 15 to < 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean±SD steady-state trough 
concentration was 108±53.8 mcg/mL. For children 6 to 11 years of age receiving 300 mg Q4W, initial 
doses of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 produce similar steady-state exposure as an initial dose of 600 mg 
on Day 1, based on PK simulations. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For children 6 months to 5 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing 
(Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 to < 30 kg) or 200 mg (≥ 5 to < 15 kg) mean ± SD steady-state trough 
concentration was 110±42.8 mcg/mL and 109±50.8 mcg/mL, respectively. 
Asthma  
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 years of age) with asthma has not been 
studied. 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in QUEST study. The mean 
±SD steady-state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 107±51.6 mcg/mL and 46.7±26.9 mcg/mL, 
respectively, for 300 mg or 200 mg administered every other week. No age-related pharmacokinetic 
difference was observed in adolescent patients after correction for body weight. 
In the VOYAGE study, dupilumab pharmacokinetics was investigated in 270 patients with moderate-
to-severe asthma following subcutaneous administration of either 100 mg Q2W (for 91 children 
weighing < 30 kg) or 200 mg Q2W (for 179 children weighing ≥ 30 kg). The volume of distribution 
for dupilumab of approximately 3.7 L was estimated by population PK analysis. Steady-state 
concentrations were achieved by week 12. The mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 
58.4±28.0 mcg/mL and 85.1±44.9 mcg/mL, respectively. Simulation of a 300 mg Q4W subcutaneous 
dose in children aged 6 to 11 years with body weight of ≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg to < 60 kg 
resulted in predicted steady-state trough concentrations similar to the observed trough concentrations 
of 200 mg Q2W (≥ 30 kg) and 100 mg Q2W (< 30 kg), respectively. In addition, simulation of a 300 
mg Q4W subcutaneous dose in children aged 6 to 11 years with body weight of ≥ 15 kg to < 60 kg 
resulted in predicted steady-state trough concentrations similar to those demonstrated to be efficacious 
in adults and adolescents. After the last steady state dose, the median time for dupilumab 
concentrations to decrease below the lower limit of detection, estimated by population PK analysis, 
was 14 to 18 weeks for 100 mg Q2W, 200 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W. 
CRSwNP 
CRSwNP does not normally occur in children. The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric 
patients (< 18 years of age) with CRSwNP has not been studied. 
PN 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with PN has not been 
studied. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis 
A total of 35 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with eosinophilic esophagitis weighing ≥40 kg were 
enrolled in TREET Parts A and B, receiving 300 mg every week dosing (QW). The mean ± SD steady-
state trough concentration of dupilumab was 227 ± 95.3 mcg/mL. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
The mutagenic potential of dupilumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are not 
expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with dupilumab. An evaluation of the available 
evidence related to IL-4Rα inhibition and animal toxicology data with surrogate antibodies does not 
suggest an increased carcinogenic potential for dupilumab. 
During a reproductive toxicology study conducted in monkeys, using a surrogate antibody specific to 
the monkey IL-4Rα, no fetal abnormalities were observed at doses that saturate the IL-4Rα.  
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental study revealed no adverse effects in maternal animals 
or their offspring up to 6 months post-partum/post-birth. 
Fertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a surrogate antibody against IL-4Rα showed 
no impairment of fertility (see section 4.6).

Table 4. 
Table 4: Dose of dupilumab for subcutaneous administration in children 6 to 11 years of 
age with asthma  
Body weight 
15 to less than 30 kg 
30 kg to less than 60 kg 
60 kg or more 
Initial and subsequent doses 
300 mg every four weeks (Q4W) 
200 mg every other week (Q2W) 
or 
300 mg every four weeks (Q4W) 
200 mg every other week (Q2W) 
For paediatric patients (6 to 11 years old) with asthma and co-morbid severe atopic dermatitis, as per 
approved indication, the recommended dose should be followed in Table 2. 
Patients receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids may reduce their steroid dose once clinical 
improvement with dupilumab has occurred (see section 5.1). Steroid reductions should be 
accomplished gradually (see section 4.4). 
Dupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered 
at least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s level of asthma 
control. 
Missed dose  
If a weekly dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible, starting a new schedule based on 
this date. 
If an every other week dose is missed, administer the injection within 7 days from the missed dose and 
then resume the patient's original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, wait 
until the next dose on the original schedule. 
If an every 4 week dose is missed, administer the injection within 7 days from the missed dose and 
then resume the patient's original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, 
administer the dose, starting a new schedule based on this date. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data 
are available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Body weight 
No dose adjustment for body weight is recommended for patients with asthma 12 years of age and 
older or in adults with atopic dermatitis (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 6 months 
have not been established. The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with a body weight < 5 kg 
have not been established. No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with severe asthma below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use 
The dupilumab pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For children 6 
months to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis, and asthma, the dupilumab pre-filled syringe is the 
presentation appropriate for administration to this population. 
Dupilumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except for the 5 cm 
around the navel. If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. 
Each pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen is for single use only. 
For the initial 400 mg dose, two 200 mg injections should be administered consecutively in different 
injection sites. 
It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. Dupilumab should not be injected 
into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. 
A patient may self-inject dupilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer dupilumab if their 
healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to 
patients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of dupilumab prior to use according to 
the Instructions for Use (IFU) section at the end of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Acute asthma exacerbations 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dupilumab should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Dupilumab 
should not be used to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. 
Corticosteroids 
Systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids should not be discontinued abruptly upon initiation of 
therapy with dupilumab. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and 
performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be 
associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by 
systemic corticosteroid therapy. 
Biomarkers of type 2 inflammation may be suppressed by systemic corticosteroid use. This should be 
taken into consideration to determine type 2 status in patients taking oral corticosteroids (see section 
5.1). 
Hypersensitivity 
If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of dupilumab 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Cases of anaphylactic reaction, 
angioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported. Anaphylactic 
reactions and angioedema have occurred from minutes to up to seven days after the dupilumab 
injection (see section 4.8). 
Eosinophilic conditions 
Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (EGPA) have been reported with dupilumab in adult patients who participated in the 
asthma development program. Cases of vasculitis consistent with EGPA have been reported with 
dupilumab and placebo in adult patients with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development 
program. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac 
complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Patients being treated 
for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features 
of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 
conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not 
always, may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
Helminth infection 
Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. 
Dupilumab may influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 
signaling. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating dupilumab. 
If patients become infected while receiving treatment with dupilumab and do not respond to anti-
helminth treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. Cases of 
enterobiasis were reported in children 6 to 11 years old who participated in the paediatric asthma 
development program (see section 4.8). 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events have been reported with dupilumab, predominantly in atopic 
dermatitis patients. Some patients reported visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision) associated with 
conjunctivitis or keratitis (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be advised to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare 
provider. Patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following 
standard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis should undergo ophthalmological 
examination, as appropriate (see section 4.8).  
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with comorbid asthma 
Patients on dupilumab who also have comorbid asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma 
treatments without consultation with their physicians. Patients with comorbid asthma should be 
monitored carefully following discontinuation of dupilumab.  
Vaccinations 
Concurrent use of live and live attenuated vaccines with dupilumab should  be avoided  as clinical 
safety and efficacy have not been established. It is recommended that patients should be brought up to 
date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines 
prior to treatment with dupilumab. Clinical data are not available to support more specific guidance for 
live or live attenuated vaccines administration in patients treated with dupilumab. Immune responses 
to TdaP vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were assessed (see section 4.5).  
Sodium content  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Immune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which patients with atopic dermatitis 
were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab. After 12 weeks of dupilumab 
administration, patients were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (T cell-dependent), and a meningococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (T cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. 
Antibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in 
dupilumab-treated and placebo-treated patients. No adverse interactions between either of the non-live 
vaccines and dupilumab were noted in the study.  
Therefore, patients receiving dupilumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. 
For information on live vaccines see section 4.4. 
In a clinical study of atopic dermatitis patients, the effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of CYP substrates were evaluated. The data gathered from this study did not indicate clinically 
relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. 
An effect of dupilumab on the PK of co-administered medicinal products is not expected. Based on the 
population analysis, commonly co-administered medicinal products had no effect on dupilumab 
pharmacokinetics on patients with moderate to severe asthma. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of dupilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Dupilumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to 
the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dupilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue dupilumab therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Animal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Dupilumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP are injection site 
reactions (includes erythema, oedema, pruritus, pain and swelling), conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis 
allergic, arthralgia, oral herpes, and eosinophilia. An additional adverse reaction of injection site 
bruising was reported in EoE. Rare cases of serum sickness, serum sickness-like reaction, anaphylactic 
reaction, and ulcerative keratitis have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The dupilumab safety data presented in Table 5 were predominantly derived from 12 randomised, 
placebo-controlled trials, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP patients. These studies 
involved 4,206 patients receiving dupilumab and 2,326 patients receiving placebo during the 
controlled period are representative of the overall safety profile for dupilumab. 
Listed in Table 5 are adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and/or postmarketing setting 
presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypersensitivity 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have 
been reported following administration of dupilumab (see section 4.4). 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events 
Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis patients who received 
dupilumab compared to placebo in atopic dermatitis studies. Most patients with conjunctivitis or 
keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. In the long-term OLE atopic 
dermatitis study (AD-1225) at 5 years, the respective rates of conjunctivitis and keratitis remained 
similar to those in the dupilumab arm in the placebo controlled atopic dermatitis studies. Among 
asthma patients frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was low and similar between dupilumab and 
placebo. Among CRSwNP and Prurigo Nodularis (PN) patients the frequency of conjunctivitis was 
higher in dupilumab than placebo, though lower than that observed in atopic dermatitis patients. There 
were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP or PN development program. Among patients with 
EoE, the frequency of conjunctivitis was low and similar between dupilumab and placebo groups. 
There were no cases of keratitis in the EoE development program (see section 4.4). 
Eczema herpeticum 
Eczema herpeticum was reported in < 1 % of the dupilumab groups and in < 1 % of the placebo group 
in the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy adult studies. In the 52-week atopic dermatitis 
dupilumab + TCS adult study, eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.2 % of the dupilumab + TCS 
group and 1.9 % of the placebo + TCS group. These rates remained stable at 5 years in the long-term 
OLE study (AD-1225). 
Eosinophilia 
Dupilumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count 
compared to patients treated with placebo in the atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP indications. 
Eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during study treatment and returned to baseline 
during the asthma open-label extension safety study (TRAVERSE). The mean blood eosinophil levels 
decreased to below baseline by week 20 and was maintained up to 5 years in the long-term OLE study 
(AD-1225). Compared to placebo, no increase in mean blood eosinophil counts was observed in PN 
(PRIME and PRIME2). Mean and median blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or 
remained below baseline levels in EoE (TREET Parts A and B) during study treatment. 
Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in < 3 % of dupilumab-treated 
patients and < 0.5 % in placebo-treated patients (SOLO1, SOLO2, AD-1021, DRI12544, QUEST, and 
VOYAGE; SINUS-24 and SINUS-52; PRIME and PRIME2; TREET Parts A and B studies) . 
Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in 8.4% of dupilumab-treated 
patients and 0% in placebo-treated patients in study AD-1539, with median eosinophil counts 
declining below baseline at end of treatment period. 
Infections 
In the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy clinical adult studies, serious infections were reported in 
1.0 % of patients treated with placebo and 0.5 % of patients treated with dupilumab. In the 52-week 
atopic dermatitis CHRONOS adult study, serious infections were reported in 0.6 % of patients treated 
with placebo and 0.2 % of patients treated with dupilumab. The rates of serious infections remained 
stable at 5 years in the long-term OLE study (AD-1225). 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for asthma clinical studies. In the 24-week safety pool, serious infections were 
reported in 1.0% of patients treated with dupilumab and 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. In the 
52-week QUEST study, serious infections were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with dupilumab 
and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo. 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for CRSwNP clinical studies. In the 52-week SINUS-52 study, serious infections 
were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with dupilumab and 1.3 % of patients treated with placebo. 
No increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo 
in the safety pool for PN clinical studies. In the safety pool, serious infections were reported in 1.3% of 
patients treated with dupilumab and 1.3% of patients treated with placebo. 
The  overall  incidence  of  infections  was  numerically  higher  with  dupilumab  (32.0%)  compared  to 
placebo (24.8%) in the safety pool for EoE TREET (Parts A and B) studies. In the 24-week safety pool, 
serious infections were reported in 0.5% of patients treated with dupilumab and 0% of patients treated 
with placebo. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with dupilumab. 
Anti-Drug-Antibodies (ADA) responses were not generally associated with impact on dupilumab 
exposure, safety, or efficacy. 
Approximately 5 % of patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or CRSwNP who received dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed ADA to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent 
ADA responses and approximately 2 % had neutralizing antibodies. Similar results were observed in 
adult patients with PN who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W for 24 weeks, paediatric patients (6 
months to 11 years of age) with atopic dermatitis who received either dupilumab 200 mg Q2W, 200 
mg Q4W or 300 mg Q4W for 16 weeks and patients (6 to 11 years of age) with asthma who received 
dupilumab 100 mg Q2W or 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks. Similar ADA responses were observed in 
adult patients with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab for up to 5 years in the long-term OLE 
study (AD-1225). 
Approximately 16 % of adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 300 mg or 
200 mg Q2W for 16 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 3 % exhibited 
persistent ADA responses, and approximately 5 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Approximately 9 % of patients with asthma who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks 
developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 4 % exhibited persistent ADA responses and 
approximately 4 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Approximately 1% of patients with EoE who received dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W for 24 
weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; 0% exhibited persistent ADA responses and approximately 
0.5% had neutralizing antibodies. 
Regardless of age or population, upto 4 % of patients in the placebo groups were positive for 
antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA response and approximately 
1 % had neutralizing antibodies. 
Less than 1 % of patients who received dupilumab at approved dosing regimens exhibited high titer 
ADA responses associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In addition, there was one patient with 
serum sickness and one with serum sickness-like reaction (< 0.1 %) associated with high ADA titers 
(see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population

Atopic dermatitis 
Adolescents (12 t o17 years of age) 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 250 patients 12 to 17 years of age with 
moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  (AD-1526).  The  safety  profile  of  dupilumab  in  these 
patients  followed  through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults with 
atopic dermatitis. 
Children 6 to 11 years of age 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 367 patients 6 to 11 years of age with severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD-1652). The safety profile of dupilumab with concomitant TCS in these 
patients through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults and adolescents 
with atopic dermatitis. 
Children 6 months to 5 years of age 
The safety of dupilumab with concomitant TCS was assessed in a study of 161 patients 6 months to 
5 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which included a subgroup of 124 patients 
with severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1539). The safety profile of dupilumab with concomitant TCS in 
these patients, through week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults and paediatric 
patients 6 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis. 
Atopic Hand and Foot Dermatitis 
The safety of dupilumab was assessed in 27 paediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-
severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis (AD-1924). The safety profile of dupilumab in these patients 
through Week 16 was consistent with the safety profile from studies in adult and paediatric patients 6 
months of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Asthma 
Adolescents (12 t o17 years of age) 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in the 52 week QUEST 
study. The safety profile observed was similar to that seen in adults. 
The long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in 89 adolescent patients who were enrolled in an 
open-label extension study in moderate-to-severe asthma (TRAVERSE). In this study, patients were 
followed for up to 96 weeks. The safety profile of dupilumab in TRAVERSE was consistent with the 
safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Children 6 to 11 years of age 
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE), the additional adverse 
reaction of enterobiasis was reported in 1.8 % (5 patients) in the dupilumab groups and none in the 
placebo group. All enterobiasis cases were mild to moderate and patients recovered with anti-helminth 
treatment without dupilumab treatment discontinuation. 
In children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma, eosinophilia (blood eosinophils 
≥ 3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event) was reported in 6.6 % of the 
dupilumab groups and 0.7% in the placebo group. Most eosinophilia cases were mild to moderate and 
not associated with clinical symptoms. These cases were transient, decreased over time, and did not 
lead to dupilumab treatment discontinuation. 
The long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in an open-label extension study (EXCURSION) in 
children 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma who previously participated in 
VOYAGE. Among 365 patients who entered EXCURSION, 350 completed 52 weeks of treatment and 
228 patients completed a cumulative treatment duration of 104 weeks (VOYAGE and EXCURSION). 
The long-term safety profile of dupilumab in EXCURSION was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in the pivotal asthma study (VOYAGE) for 52 weeks of treatment. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EoE 
A total of 99 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with EoE were enrolled in the TREET (Parts A and B) 
studies. The safety profile observed was similar to that seen in adults.  
Long-term safety 
Atopic dermatitis 
The safety profile of dupilumab + TCS (CHRONOS) in adult atopic dermatitis patients) through week 
52 was consistent with the safety profile observed at week 16. The long-term safety of dupilumab was 
assessed in an open-label extension study in patients 6 months to 17 years of age with moderate-to-
severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1434). The safety profile of dupilumab in patients followed through 
week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at week 16 in the AD-1526, AD-1652, and AD-
1539 studies. The long-term safety profile of dupilumab observed in children and adolescents was 
consistent with that seen in adults with atopic dermatitis. 
In a phase 3, multicentre, open label extension (OLE) study (AD-1225), the long-term safety of repeat 
doses of dupilumab was assessed in 2,677 adults with moderate-to-severe AD exposed to 300 mg 
weekly dosing (99.7 %), including 179 who completed at least 260 weeks of the study. The long-term 
safety profile observed in this study up to 5 years was generally consistent with the safety profile of 
dupilumab observed in controlled studies. 
Asthma 
The safety profile of dupilumab in the 96 weeks long term safety study (TRAVERSE) was consistent 
with the safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
The safety profile of dupilumab in children with asthma 6 to 11 years of age who participated in the 52 
weeks long-term safety study (EXCURSION) was consistent with the safety profile observed in the 
pivotal asthma study (VOYAGE) for 52 weeks of treatment. 
CRSwNP 
The safety profile of dupilumab in adults with CRSwNP through week 52 was consistent with the 
safety profile observed at week 24. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis 
The safety profile of dupilumab through week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile 
observed at week 24. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for dupilumab overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic 
treatment immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding 
corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH05  
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 and 
interleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and 
both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). IL-4 and IL-13 are 
major drivers of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis and asthma. Blocking 
the IL-4/IL-13 pathway with dupilumab in patients decreases many of the mediators of type 2 
inflammation.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In atopic dermatitis clinical trials, treatment with dupilumab was associated with decreases from 
baseline in concentrations of type 2 immunity biomarkers, such as thymus and activation-regulated 
chemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE in serum. A reduction of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), a biomarker associated with AD disease activity and severity, was observed 
with dupilumab treatment in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. 
In adult and adolescent patients with asthma, dupilumab treatment relative to placebo markedly 
decreased FeNO and circulating concentrations of eotaxin-3, total IgE, allergen specific IgE, TARC, 
and periostin, the type 2 biomarkers evaluated in clinical trials. These reductions in type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers were comparable for the 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W regimens. In 
paediatric (6 to 11 years of age) patients with asthma, dupilumab treatment relative to placebo 
markedly decreased FeNO and circulating concentrations of total IgE, allergen specific IgE, and 
TARC, the type 2 biomarkers evaluated in clinical trials. These markers were near maximal 
suppression after 2 weeks of treatment, except for IgE which declined more slowly. These effects were 
sustained throughout treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in atopic dermatitis 
Adolescents with atopic dermatitis (12 to 17 years of age) 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  dupilumab  monotherapy  in  adolescent  patients was  evaluated  in  a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1526) in 251 adolescent 
patients  12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) defined by 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a 
severity scale of 0 to 4, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16 on a scale of 0 to 
72, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement  of ≥10 %.  Eligible patients enrolled 
into this study had previous inadequate response to topical medication. 
Patients received dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injections either as: 1) an 
initial dose of 400 mg dupilumab (two 200 mg injections) on day 1, followed by  200 mg once 
every other week (Q2W) for patients with baseline weight of < 60 kg or an initial dose of  600 mg 
dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W for patients with baseline 
weight of ≥ 60 kg; or 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, 
followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) regardless of baseline body weight; or 3) matching 
placebo. If needed to control intolerable symptoms,  patients were permitted to receive rescue 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who  received rescue treatment were 
considered non-responders. 
In this study, the mean age was 14.5 years, the median weight was 59.4 kg, 41.0 % were female, 
62.5 % were White, 15.1 % were Asian, and 12.0 % were Black. At baseline 46.2 % of patients 
had a  baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), 53.8 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe 
AD), the  mean BSA involvement was 56.5 %, and 42.4 % of patients had received prior systemic

immunosuppressants. Also at baseline the mean Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score 
was  35.5, the baseline weekly averaged pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was 7.6, the 
baseline mean Patient Oriented Eczema  Measure (POEM) score was 21.0, and the baseline mean 
Children Dermatology Life Quality Index  (CDLQI) was 13.6. Overall, 92.0 % of patients had at 
least one co-morbid allergic condition; 65.6 %  had allergic rhinitis, 53.6 % had asthma, and 
60.8 % had food allergies. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost 
clear”)  least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement 
of at least  75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16.

A larger percentage of patients randomised to placebo needed rescue treatment (topical corticosteroids, 
systemic corticosteroids, or systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants) as compared to the 
dupilumab group (58.8 % and 20.7 %, respectively). 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab achieved a rapid improvement 
in the pruritus NRS compared to placebo (defined as ≥ 4-point improvement as early as week 4; 
nominal p< 0.001) and the proportion of patients responding on the pruritus NRS continued to increase 
through the treatment period. 
The dupilumab group significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, the impact of AD on sleep 
and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM and CDLQI scores at 16 weeks compared to 
placebo.

The long-term efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had 
participated in previous clinical trials of dupilumab was assessed in open-label extension study (AD-
1434). Efficacy data from this study suggests that clinical benefit provided at week 16 was sustained 
through week 52. 
Paediatrics (6 to 11 years of age) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients concomitantly with TCS was evaluated in a 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1652) in 367 subjects 6 to 11 
years of age, with severe AD defined by an IGA score of 4 (scale of 0 to 4), an EASI score ≥ 21 (scale 
of 0 to 72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 15 %. Eligible patients enrolled into this trial had 
previous inadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (< 30 
kg; ≥ 30 kg). 
Patients in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group with baseline weight of < 30 kg received an initial dose 
of 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 100 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14, and patients with baseline 
weight of ≥ 30 kg received an initial dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W from week 2 
to week 14. Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group received an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, 
followed by 300 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, regardless of weight. 
In this study, the mean age was 8.5 years, the median weight was 29.8 kg, 50.1 % of patients were 
female, 69.2 % were White, 16.9 % were Black, and 7.6 % were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA 
involvement was 57.6 %, and 16.9 % had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. 
Also, at baseline the mean EASI score was 37.9, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was 
7.8 on a scale of 0-10, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 73.6, the baseline POEM score was 
20.9, and the baseline mean CDLQI was 15.1. Overall, 91.7 % of subjects had at least one co-morbid 
allergic condition; 64.4 % had food allergies, 62.7 % had other allergies, 60.2 % had allergic rhinitis, 
and 46.7 % had asthma. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) at 
least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least 
75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16.

A greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab + TCS achieved an improvement in the peak 
pruritus NRS compared to placebo + TCS (defined as ≥4-point improvement at week 4). 
The dupilumab groups significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, the impact of AD on sleep 
and health-related quality of life as measured by POEM and CDLQI scores at 16 weeks compared to 
placebo. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis who had participated in the previous clinical trials of dupilumab + TCS was assessed 
in an open-label extension study (AD-1434). Efficacy data from this trial suggests that clinical benefit 
provided at week 16 was sustained through week 52. Some patients receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q4W 
+ TCS showed further clinical benefit when escalated to dupilumab 200 mg Q2W + TCS. The safety 
profile of dupilumab in patients followed through week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at 
week 16 in the AD-1526 and AD-1652 studies. 
Paediatrics (6 Months to 5 years of age) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients was evaluated in a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1539) in 162 patients 6 months to 5 years of 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
age, with moderate-to-severe AD (ITT population) defined by an IGA score ≥ 3 (scale of 0 to 4), an 
EASI score ≥ 16 (scale of 0 to 72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 10. Of the 162 patients, 125 
patients had severe AD defined by an IGA score of 4. Eligible patients enrolled into this study had 
previous inadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (≥ 5 
to < 15 kg and ≥ 15 to < 30 kg). 
Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group with baseline weight of ≥ 5 to < 15 kg received an initial 
dose of 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, and patients with 
baseline weight of ≥ 15 to < 30 kg received an initial dose of 300 mg on Day 1, followed by 300 mg 
Q4W from week 4 to week 12. Patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator. Patients who received rescue treatment were considered non-responders. 
In AD-1539, the mean age was 3.8 years, the median weight was 16.5 kg, 38.9% of patients were 
female, 68.5% were White, 18.5% were Black, and 6.2% were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA 
involvement was 58.4%, and 15.5% had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. 
Also, at baseline the mean EASI score was 34.1, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was 
7.6 on a scale of 0-10. Overall, 81.4% of patients had at least one co-morbid allergic condition; 68.3% 
had food allergies, 52.8% had other allergies, 44.1% had allergic rhinitis, and 25.5% had asthma. 
These baseline disease characteristics were comparable between moderate-to-severe and severe AD 
populations. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) at 
least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least 
75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an 
IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at week 16.

*Caregiver reported outcome 
A significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab + TCS achieved a rapid 
improvement in the Worst Scratch/Itch NRS compared to placebo + TCS (defined as ≥ 4-point 
improvement as early as week 3, nominal p< 0.005) and the proportion of patients responding on the 
Worst Scratch/Itch NRS continued to increase through the treatment period. 
In this study, dupilumab significantly improved health-related quality of life as measured by the 
CDLQI (in 85 patients 4 to 5 years old) and IDQOL (in 77 patients 6 months to 3 years old). In the  
ITT population, greater LS mean changes in CDLQI and IDQOL scores from baseline to week 16 
were observed in the dupilumab + TCS (-10.0 and -10.9) group compared to the placebo + TCS group 
(-2.5 and -2.0), respectively (p< 0.0001). Similar improvements in both CDLQI and IDQOL were 
observed in the severe AD population. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab + TCS in paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis who had participated in the previous clinical trials of dupilumab + TCS were 
assessed in an open-label extension study (AD-1434). Efficacy data from this trial suggest that clinical 
benefit provided at week 16 was sustained through week 52. The safety profile of dupilumab in 
patients followed through week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at week 16 in the AD- 
1539 study. 
Atopic Hand and Foot Dermatitis (adults and adolescents) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab was evaluated in a 16-week multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (AD-1924) in 133 adult and paediatric patients 12 to 17 
years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis, defined by an IGA (hand and 
foot) score ≥3 (scale of 0 to 4) and a hand and foot Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score 
for maximum itch intensity ≥4 (scale of 0 to 10). Eligible patients had previous inadequate response or 
intolerance to treatment of hand and foot dermatitis with topical AD medications. 
In AD-1924, 38% of patients were male, 80% were White, 72% of subjects had a baseline IGA (hand 
and foot) score of 3 (moderate atopic hand and foot dermatitis), and 28% of patients had a baseline 
IGA (hand and foot) score of 4 (severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis). The baseline weekly averaged 
hand and foot Peak Pruritus NRS score was 7.1.  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an IGA hand and foot score of 0 (clear) or 1 
(almost clear) at Week 16. The key secondary endpoint was reduction of itch as measured by the hand 
and foot Peak Pruritus NRS (≥4-point improvement). Other patient reported outcomes included 
assessment of hand and foot skin pain NRS (0-10), quality of sleep NRS (0-10), quality of life in Hand 
Eczema Questionnaire (0-117) (QoLHEQ) and work productivity and impairment (WPAI) (0-100%). 
The proportion of patients with an IGA (hand and foot) 0 to 1 at Week 16 was 40.3% for dupilumab 
and 16.7% for placebo (treatment difference 23.6, 95% CI: 8.84, 38.42). The proportion of patients 
70 
 
 
 
 
with improvement (reduction) of weekly averaged hand and foot Peak Pruritus NRS ≥4 at Week 16 
was 52.2% for dupilumab and 13.6% for placebo (treatment difference 38.6, 95% CI: 24.06, 53.15).  
Greater improvements for hand and foot skin pain NRS, quality of sleep NRS, QoLHEQ score and 
WPAI overall work impairment and routine activity impairment from baseline to week 16 were seen in 
the dupilumab group as compared to the placebo group (LS mean change of dupilumab vs placebo: -
4.66 vs -1.93 [p < 0.0001], 0.88 vs -0.00 [p < 0.05], -40.28 vs -16.18 [p < 0.0001], -38.57% vs -
22.83% [nominal p<0.001] and -36.39% vs -21.26% [nominal p < 0.001] respectively).

Product Characteristics. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in asthma  
The asthma development program included three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multi-centre studies (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE) of 24 to 52 weeks in 
treatment duration which enrolled a total of 2,888 patients (12 years of age and older). Patients were 
enrolled without requiring a minimum baseline blood eosinophil or other type 2 inflammatory 
biomarkers (e.g. FeNO or IgE) level. Asthma treatment guidelines define type 2 inflammation as 
eosinophilia ≥ 150 cells/mcL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the pre-specified 
subgroup analyses included blood eosinophils ≥ 150 and ≥ 300 cells/mcL, FeNO ≥ 25 and ≥ 50 ppb. 
DRI12544 was a 24-week dose-ranging study which included 776 patients (18 years of age and older). 
Dupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma on 
a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist. The primary endpoint 
was change from baseline to week 12 in FEV1 (L). Annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbation 
events during the 24-week placebo controlled treatment period was also determined. Results were 
evaluated in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count.  
QUEST was a 52-week confirmatory study which included 1,902 patients (12 years of age and older). 
Dupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 adolescent and 1,795 adult patients with 
persistent asthma on a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a second controller 
medication. Patients requiring a third controller were allowed to participate in this trial. The primary 
endpoints were the annualised rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week placebo 
controlled period and change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 in the overall 
population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) 
and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO. 
VENTURE was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 patients with asthma unrestricted 
by baseline type 2 biomarker levels who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of 
high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. The OCS dose was optimized during 
the screening period. Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the study; 
however their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase (week 4-20), as 
long as asthma control was maintained. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in oral 
corticosteroid dose assessed in the overall population, based on a comparison of the oral corticosteroid 
dose at weeks 20 to 24 that maintained asthma control with the previously optimized (at baseline) oral 
corticosteroid dose. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 studies are provided in Table 9 below.

Exacerbations 
In the overall population in DRI12544 and QUEST subjects receiving either dupilumab 200 mg or 
300 mg every other week had significant reductions in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
compared to placebo. There were greater reductions in exacerbations in subjects with higher baseline 
levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as blood eosinophils or FeNO (Table 10 and Table 11).

In the pooled analysis of DRI12544 and QUEST, hospitalisations and/or emergency room visits due to 
severe exacerbations were reduced by 25.5 % and 46.9 % with dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 
other week, respectively. 
Lung function 
Clinically significant increases in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at week 12 for DRI12544 
and QUEST. There were greater improvements in FEV1 in the subjects with higher baseline levels of 
type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as blood eosinophils or FeNO (Table 12 and Table 13). 
Significant improvements in FEV1 were observed as early as week 2 following the first dose of 
dupilumab for both the 200 mg and 300 mg dose strengths and were maintained through week 24 
(DRI12544) and week 52 in QUEST (see Figure 1).

Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes in asthma 
Pre-specified secondary endpoint of ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) responder rates were analysed at 24 weeks 
(DRI12544 and VENTURE) and at 52 weeks (QUEST, Table 14). The responder rate was defined as 
an improvement in score of 0.5 or more (scale range 0-6 for ACQ-5 and 1-7 for AQLQ(S)). 
Improvements in ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) were observed as early as week 2 and maintained for 24 
weeks in DRI12544 study and 52 weeks in QUEST study. Similar results were observed in 
VENTURE.

VENTURE evaluated the effect of dupilumab on reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids. 
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 9. All patients were on oral corticosteroids for at least 6 
months prior to the study initiation. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was 11.75 mg in the 
placebo group and 10.75 mg in the group receiving dupilumab. 
In this 24-week trial, asthma exacerbations (defined as a temporary increase in oral corticosteroid dose 
for at least 3 days) were reduced by 59 % in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those 
receiving placebo (annualised rate 0.65 and 1.60 for the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively; 
rate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.26, 0.63]) and improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to 
week 24 was greater in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those receiving placebo (LS mean 
difference for dupilumab versus placebo of 0.22 L [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34 L]). Effects on lung function, 
on oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 
inflammatory biomarkers (e.g. blood eosinophils, FeNO). The ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) were also 
assessed in VENTURE and showed improvements similar to those in QUEST. 
The results for VENTURE by baseline biomarkers are presented in the Table 15.

Long-term extension study (TRAVERSE) 
The long-term safety of dupilumab in 2,193 adults and 89 adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma, 
including 185 adults with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, who had participated in previous 
clinical trials of dupilumab (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE), was assessed in the open-label 
extension study (TRAVERSE) (see section 4.8). Efficacy was measured as a secondary endpoint, was 
similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. In the adults with 
oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma, there was sustained reduction in exacerbations and improvement 
in lung function up to 96 weeks, despite decrease or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid dose. 
Paediatric study (6 to 11 years of age; VOYAGE) 
The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients was evaluated in a 52-week multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (VOYAGE) in 408 patients 6 to 11 years of age, 
with moderate-to-severe asthma on a medium- or high- dose ICS and one controller medication or high 
dose ICS alone. Patients were randomised to dupilumab (N=273) or matching placebo (N=135) every 
other week based on body weight ≤ 30 kg or > 30 kg, respectively. The efficacy was evaluated in 
populations with type 2 inflammation defined as blood eosinophil levels of ≥ 150 cells/mcL or FeNO 
≥ 20 ppb. 
The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week 
placebo-controlled period and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted at week 12. Additional secondary endpoints included mean 
change from baseline and responder rates in the ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA scores.

Dupilumab significantly reduced the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 
52-week treatment period compared to placebo in the population with the type 2 inflammation and in 
population defined by baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL or by baseline FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. 
Clinically significant improvements in percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at 
week 12. Improvements were also observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA at week 24 and were 
sustained at week 52. Greater responder rates were observed for ACQ-7-IA and PAQLQ(S)-IA 
compared to placebo at week 24. The efficacy results for VOYAGE are presented in Table 17. 
In the population with the type 2 inflammation, the LS mean change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 0.12 L in the placebo group, 
with an LS mean difference versus placebo of 0.10 L (95% CI: 0.04, 0.16). The treatment effect was 
sustained over the 52-week treatment period, with an LS mean difference versus placebo at week 52 of 
0.17 L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.24). 
In the population defined by baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL, the LS mean change from 
baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was 0.22 L in the dupilumab group and 0.12 L in the 
placebo group, with an LS mean difference versus placebo of 0.10 L (95% CI: 0.03, 0.17). The 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment effect was sustained over the 52-week treatment period, with an LS mean difference versus 
placebo at week 52 of 0.17 L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.26). 
In both primary efficacy populations, there was a rapid improvement in FEF25-75% and FEV1/FVC 
(onset of a difference was observed as early as week 2) and sustained over the 52-week treatment 
period, see Table 17.

In VOYAGE, in the population with the type 2 inflammation, the mean annualised total number of 
systemic corticosteroid courses due to asthma was reduced by 59.3% versus placebo (0.350 [95% CI: 
0.256, 0.477] versus 0.860 [95% CI: 0.616, 1.200]). In the population defined by baseline blood 
eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/mcL, the mean annualised total number of systemic corticosteroid courses due 
to asthma was reduced by 66.0% versus placebo (0.274 [95% CI: 0.188, 0.399] versus 0.806 [95% CI: 
0.563, 1.154]). 
Dupilumab improved the overall health status as measured by the European Quality of Life 5-
Dimension Youth Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) in both the type 2 inflammation and the baseline 
blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mcL populations at week 52; the LS mean difference versus 
placebo was 4.73 (95% CI: 1.18, 8.28), and 3.38 (95% CI: -0.66, 7.43), respectively. 
Dupilumab reduced the impact of paediatric patient’s asthma on the caregiver quality of life as 
measured by the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) in both the type 2 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inflammation and the baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mcL population at week 52; the 
LS mean difference versus placebo was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.72), and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.79), 
respectively. 
Long-term extension study (EXCURSION) 
The efficacy of dupilumab, measured as a secondary endpoint, was assessed in 365 paediatric asthma 
patients (6 to 11 years of age) in the long-term extension study (EXCURSION). There were sustained 
reductions in exacerbations requiring hospitalization and/or emergency room visits and a reduction in 
exposure to systemic oral corticosteroids. Sustained improvements in lung function were observed 
across multiple parameters including percent predicted FEV1, percent predicted FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio 
and percent predicted FEF 25-75%. Furthermore, 75% of patients achieved and/or maintained normal 
lung function with pre-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 > 80% by the end of EXCURSION. 
Efficacy was sustained for a cumulative treatment duration of up to 104 weeks (VOYAGE and 
EXCURSION). 
Paediatric population 
Atopic dermatitis  
The safety and efficacy of dupilumab have been established in paediatric patients 6 months of age and 
older with atopic dermatitis. Use of dupilumab in this age group is supported by study AD-1526 which 
included 251 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, in study 
AD-1652 which included 367 paediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years old with severe atopic dermatitis, 
and study AD-1539 which included 162 children ages 6 months to 5 years old with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis (125 of whom had severe atopic dermatitis). Long termuse is supported by study AD-
1434 which enrolled 823 paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years of age; this included 275 
adolescents, 368 children 6 to 11 years of age, and 180 children 6 months to 5 years of age. The safety 
and efficacy were generally consistent between children 6 months to 5 years old, 6 to 11 years old, 
adolescent (12 to 17 years old), and adult patients with atopic dermatitis (see section 4.8). Safety and 
efficacy in paediatric patients < 6 monthsof age with atopic dermatitis have not been established. 
Asthma 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled in 
QUEST study and received either 200 mg (N=21) or 300 mg (N=18) dupilumab (or matching placebo 
either 200 mg [N=34] or 300 mg [N=34]) every other week. Efficacy with respect to severe asthma 
exacerbations and lung function was observed in both adolescents and adults. For both the 200 mg and 
300 mg every other week doses, significant improvements in FEV1 (LS mean change from baseline at 
week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg every other week dose, 
patients had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. The safety 
profile in adolescents was generally similar to the adults. 
A total of 89 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in the 
open label long-term study (TRAVERSE). In this study, efficacy was measured as a secondary 
endpoint, was similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. 
A total of 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma was enrolled in the 
VOYAGE study, which evaluated doses of 100 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W. The efficacy of 
dupilumab 300 mg Q4W in children aged 6 to 11 years is extrapolated from the efficacy of 100 mg 
and 200 mg Q2W in VOYAGE and 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W in adults and adolescents (QUEST). 
Patients who completed the treatment period of the VOYAGE study could participate in the open label 
extension study (EXCURSION). Eighteen patients (≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg) out of 365 patients were 
exposed to 300 mg Q4W in this study, and the safety profile was similar to that seen in VOYAGE. 
Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients < 6 years of age with asthma have not been established. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
dupilumab in one or more subset of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information on paediatric use). Obligations related to the paediatric investigation plans for atopic 
dermatitis have been fulfilled. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab is similar in patients with atopic dermatitis and asthma. 
Absorption 
After a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 75-600 mg dupilumab to adults, median times to maximum 
concentration in serum (tmax) were 3-7 days. The absolute bioavailability of dupilumab following a SC 
dose is similar between AD and asthma patients, ranging between 61 % and 64 %, as determined by a 
population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. 
Steady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting 
dose and 300 mg dose every other week. Across clinical trials, the mean ±SD steady-state trough 
concentrations ranged from 69.2±36.9 mcg/mL to 80.2±35.3 mcg/mL for 300 mg dose and from 
29.2±18.7 to 36.5±22.2 mcg/mL for 200 mg dose administered every other week to adults. 
Distribution 
A volume of distribution for dupilumab of approximately 4.6 L was estimated by population PK 
analysis, indicating that dupilumab is distributed primarily in the vascular system. 
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because dupilumab is a protein. Dupilumab is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
Dupilumab elimination is mediated by parallel linear and nonlinear pathways. At higher 
concentrations, dupilumab elimination is primarily through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while 
at lower concentrations, the non-linear saturable IL-4R α target-mediated elimination predominates. 
After the last steady state dose of 300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, or 200 mg 
Q4W dupilumab, the median times to decrease below the lower limit of detection, estimated by 
population PK analysis, ranged from 9-13 weeks in adults and adolescents and are approximately 1.5 
times and 2.5 times longer in paediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age and paediatric subjects less than 6 
years of age, respectively. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Due to nonlinear clearance, dupilumab exposure, as measured by area under the concentration-time 
curve, increases with dose in a greater than proportional manner following single SC doses from 75-
600 mg. 
Special populations 
Gender 
Gender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure 
of dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. 
Elderly 
Of the 1,539 patients with atopic dermatitis, including patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis 
exposed to dupilumab in a phase 2 dose-ranging study or phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 
71 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and younger adult atopic dermatitis patients, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient 
to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 
Age was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of 
dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. However, there were only 61 patients over 65 years 
of age included in this analysis. 
Of the 1,977 patients with asthma exposed to dupilumab, a total of 240 patients were 65 years or older 
and 39 patients were 75 years or older. Efficacy and safety in this age group were similar to the overall 
study population. 
Race 
Race was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure 
of dupilumab by population PK analysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. 
Renal impairment 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal 
impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of dupilumab. Very 
limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Body weight 
Dupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight with no meaningful 
impact on efficacy. 
Paediatric population 
Atopic dermatitis 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age did not affect dupilumab clearance in adults and in 
paediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. In paediatric patients from 6 months to 5 years of age, 
clearance increased with age but is accommodated in the recommended dose regimen. 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 monthsof age) or body weight < 5 kg 
with atopic dermatitis has not been studied. 
For adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every other week dosing (Q2W) 
with either 200 mg (<60 kg) or 300 mg (≥60 kg), the mean ±SD steady state trough concentration of 
dupilumab was 54.5±27.0 mcg/mL. 
For children 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing (Q4W) with 
300 mg (≥ 15 kg) in AD-1652, the mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 76.3±37.2 
mcg/mL. At week 16 in AD-1434 in children 6 to 11 years of age who initiated every four week 
dosing (Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 kg), and whose dose was increased to every other week dosing 
(Q2W) with 200 mg (≥ 15 to < 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean±SD steady-state trough 
concentration was 108±53.8 mcg/mL. For children 6 to 11 years of age receiving 300 mg Q4W, initial 
doses of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 produce similar steady-state exposure as an initial dose of 600 mg 
on Day 1, based on PK simulations. 
For children 6 months to 5 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing 
(Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 to < 30 kg) or 200 mg (≥ 5 to < 15 kg) mean ± SD steady-state trough 
concentration was 110±42.8 mcg/mL and 109±50.8 mcg/mL, respectively. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Asthma 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 years of age) with asthma has not been 
studied. 
A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in QUEST study. The mean 
±SD steady-state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 107±51.6 mcg/mL and 46.7±26.9 mcg/mL, 
respectively, for 300 mg or 200 mg administered every other week. No age-related pharmacokinetic 
difference was observed in adolescent patients after correction for body weight. 
In the VOYAGE study, dupilumab pharmacokinetics was investigated in 270 patients with moderate-
to-severe asthma following subcutaneous administration of either 100 mg Q2W (for 91 children 
weighing < 30 kg) or 200 mg Q2W (for 179 children weighing ≥ 30 kg). The volume of distribution 
for dupilumab of approximately 3.7 L was estimated by population PK analysis. Steady-state 
concentrations were achieved by week 12. The mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 
58.4±28.0 mcg/mL and 85.1±44.9 mcg/mL, respectively. Simulation of a 300 mg Q4W subcutaneous 
dose in children aged 6 to 11 years with body weight of ≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg to < 60 kg 
resulted in predicted steady-state trough concentrations similar to the observed trough concentrations 
of 200 mg Q2W (≥ 30 kg) and 100 mg Q2W (< 30 kg), respectively. In addition, simulation of a 300 
mg Q4W subcutaneous dose in children aged 6 to 11 years with body weight of ≥ 15 kg to < 60 kg 
resulted in predicted steady-state trough concentrations similar to those demonstrated to be efficacious 
in adults and adolescents. After the last steady state dose, the median time for dupilumab 
concentrations to decrease below the lower limit of detection, estimated by population PK analysis, 
was 14 to 18 weeks for 100 mg Q2W, 200 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
The mutagenic potential of dupilumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are not 
expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with dupilumab. An evaluation of the available 
evidence related to IL-4Rα inhibition and animal toxicology data with surrogate antibodies does not 
suggest an increased carcinogenic potential for dupilumab. 
During a reproductive toxicology study conducted in monkeys, using a surrogate antibody specific to 
the monkey IL-4Rα, no fetal abnormalities were observed at doses that saturate the IL-4Rα.  
An enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental study revealed no adverse effects in maternal animals 
or their offspring up to 6 months post-partum/post-birth. 
Fertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a surrogate antibody against IL-4Rα showed 
no impairment of fertility (see section 4.6).

1.  What Dupixent is and what it is used for 
What Dupixent is 
Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. 
Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins 
called interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis 
(PN) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). 
What Dupixent is used for 
Dupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 months to 11 years 
old with severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the 
skin or it may be used on its own.  
Dupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their 
current asthma medicines (e.g. corticosteroids). 
Dupixent is also used with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose 
disease is not controlled with their current CRSwNP medicines. Dupixent can also reduce the need for 
surgery and the need for systemic corticosteroid use. 
Dupixent is also used to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN), also known as 
chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG). Dupixent may be used with PN medicines that you apply to the skin 
or it may be used on its own. 
Dupixent is also used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with 
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). 
How Dupixent works 
Using Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and 
reduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and 
overall quality of life. 
Dupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. 
Dupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your 
asthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your 
breathing. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Dupixent 
Do not use Dupixent  
• 
if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Dupixent. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: 
Dupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
Every time you get a new pack of Dupixent, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and 
anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven days 
after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing 
problems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling 
lightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, 
joint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side 
effects” in section 4. 
•  Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
of an allergic reaction. 
Eosinophilic conditions 
•  Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs 
• 
due to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). 
It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in 
people who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being 
lowered. 
•  Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, 
pins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. 
Parasitic (intestinal parasites) infection 
•  Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a 
parasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. 
•  Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration 
• 
which could be a sign of a parasitic infection. 
If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region 
check with your doctor. 
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Asthma 
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine 
without talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains 
uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. 
Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision.

Other medicines for asthma

•  These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. 
•  This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to 
Dupixent. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; 
therefore, it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to 
use it. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent. You should 
not do both. 
•

1.  What Dupixent is and what it is used for 
What Dupixent is 
Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. 
Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins 
called interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis 
(PN) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). 
What Dupixent is used for 
Dupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 months to 11 years 
old with severe atopic dermatitis (see section Children and adolescents). Dupixent may be used with 
eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own.  
Dupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in 
adults. adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their 
current asthma medicines (e.g. corticosteroids). 
Dupixent is also used with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose 
disease is not controlled with their current CRSwNP medicines. Dupixent can also reduce the need for 
surgery and the need for systemic corticosteroid use. 
Dupixent is also used to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN), also known as 
chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG). Dupixent may be used with PN medicines that you apply to the skin 
or it may be used on its own. 
Dupixent is also used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with 
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). 
How Dupixent works 
Using Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and 
reduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression 
160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and 
overall quality of life. 
Dupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. 
Dupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your 
asthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your 
breathing. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Dupixent 
Do not use Dupixent  
• 
if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Dupixent. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: 
Dupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
Every time you get a new pack of Dupixent, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and 
anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven days 
after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing 
problems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling 
lightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, 
joint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side 
effects” in section 4. 
•  Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
of an allergic reaction.  
Eosinophilic conditions 
•  Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs 
• 
due to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). 
It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in 
people who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being 
lowered. 
•  Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, 
pins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. 
Parasitic (intestinal parasites) infection 
•  Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a 
parasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. 
•  Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration 
• 
which could be a sign of a parasitic infection. 
If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region 
check with your doctor. 
Asthma 
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine 
without talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains 
uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. 
161

1.  What Dupixent is and what it is used for 
What Dupixent is 
Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. 
Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins 
called interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis and asthma. 
What Dupixent is used for 
Dupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 months to 11 years 
old with severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the 
skin or it may be used on its own.  
Dupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their 
current asthma medicines (e.g. corticosteroids). 
How Dupixent works 
Using Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and 
reduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression 
associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and 
overall quality of life. 
Dupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. 
Dupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your 
asthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your 
breathing. 
183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Dupixent 
Do not use Dupixent  
• 
if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Dupixent. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: 
Dupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
Every time you get a new pack of Dupixent, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and 
anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven days 
after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing 
problems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling 
lightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, 
joint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side 
effects” in section 4. 
•  Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
of an allergic reaction. 
Eosinophilic conditions 
•  Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs 
• 
due to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). 
It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in 
people who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being 
lowered. 
•  Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, 
pins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. 
Parasitic (intestinal parasites) infection 
•  Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a 
parasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. 
•  Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration 
• 
which could be a sign of a parasitic infection. 
If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region 
check with your doctor. 
Asthma 
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine 
without talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains 
uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. 
Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision. 
Children and adolescents 
•  The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with atopic dermatitis below the 
age of 6 months. 
184 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with asthma below the age of 6 
years. 
Other medicines and Dupixent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist  
• 
• 
if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. 
Other medicines for asthma 
Do not stop or reduce your asthma medicines, unless instructed by your doctor. 
•  These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. 
•  This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to 
Dupixent. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; 
therefore, it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to 
use it. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent. You should 
not do both. 
• 
Driving and using machines  
Dupixent is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. 
Dupixent contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

This device is a single-use pre-filled syringe. It contains 200 mg of Dupixent for injection under the 
skin (subcutaneous injection). 
You must not try to give yourself or someone else the injection unless you have received training from 
your healthcare professional. In adolescents 12 years and older, it is recommended that Dupixent be 
administered by or under supervision of an adult. In children less than 12 years of age, Dupixent 
should be given by a caregiver. 
•  Read all of the instructions carefully before using the syringe.

•  Do not use the syringe if the needle cap is missing or not securely attached. 
•  Do not touch the plunger rod until you are ready to inject. 
•  Do not inject through clothes. 
•  Do not get rid of any air bubbles in the syringe.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dupixent is and what it is used for 
What Dupixent is 
Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. 
Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins 
called interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis and asthma. 
What Dupixent is used for 
Dupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 months to 11 years 
old with severe atopic dermatitis (see section Children and adolescents). Dupixent may be used with 
eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own.  
Dupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their 
current asthma medicines (e.g. corticosteroids). 
How Dupixent works 
Using Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and 
reduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression 
associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and 
overall quality of life. 
Dupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. 
Dupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your 
asthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your 
breathing. 
198 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Dupixent 
Do not use Dupixent  
• 
if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Dupixent. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: 
Dupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
Every time you get a new pack of Dupixent, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Allergic reactions 
•  Rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and 
anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven days 
after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing 
problems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling 
lightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, 
joint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side 
effects” in section 4. 
•  Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
of an allergic reaction. 
Eosinophilic conditions 
•  Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs 
• 
due to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). 
It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in 
people who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being 
lowered. 
•  Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, 
pins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. 
Parasitic (intestinal parasites) infection 
•  Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a 
parasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. 
•  Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration 
• 
which could be a sign of a parasitic infection. 
If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region 
check with your doctor. 
Asthma 
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine 
without talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains 
uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. 
Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision. 
Children and adolescents 
•  The Dupixent pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For 
children aged 6 months to11 years of age with atopic dermatitis and asthma, contact your doctor 
199 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who will prescribe the appropriate Dupixent pre-filled syringe. 
•  The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with atopic dermatitis below the 
age of 6 months. 
•  The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with asthma below the age of 6 
years. 
Other medicines and Dupixent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist  
• 
• 
if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. 
Other medicines for asthma 
Do not stop or reduce your asthma medicines, unless instructed by your doctor. 
•  These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. 
•  This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to 
Dupixent. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; 
therefore, it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to 
use it. 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent. You should 
not do both. 
• 
Driving and using machines  
Dupixent is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. 
Dupixent contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg dose, that is to say essentially

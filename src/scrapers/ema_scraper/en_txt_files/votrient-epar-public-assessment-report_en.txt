During the CHMP meeting on 16-19 November 2009, the CHMP agreed on a list of outstanding 
issues to be addressed in writing by the applicant. 
The  applicant  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CHMP  list  of  outstanding  issues  on  21  December 
2009. 
The Rapporteurs circulated the Joint Assessment Report on the applicant’s responses to the List 
of Outstanding Issues to all CHMP members on 5 January 2010. 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting took place on 
8 January 2010 to provide advice on the list of questions adopted by the CHMP at its November 
2009 meeting. 
The Rapporteurs circulated the Updated Joint Assessment Report on the applicant’s responses to 
the List of Outstanding Issues to all CHMP members on 13 and 14 January 2010. 
The CHMP adopted two reports on similarity of Votrient with Nexavar (sorafenib)/Torisel 
(temsirolimus) and Afinitor (everolimus) in June 2009 and January 2010.  
During the meeting on 15-18 February 2010, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted 
and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
conditional Marketing Authorisation to Votrient on 18 February 2010. The applicant provided the 
letter  of  undertaking  on  the  specific  obligations  and  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  post-
authorisation on 17 February 2010. 
On  7  April  2010  the  applicant  requested  the  Commission  to  remove  the  product  from  the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products. 
On  15  April  2010,  the  European  Commission  informed  the  EMA  that  a  conditional  marketing 
authorisation  as  recommended  by  the  CHMP  opinion  could  not  be  granted  because  the  CHMP 
recommendation  was  based  on  Article  2(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006,  i.e.  medicinal 
product designated as orphan medicinal product in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000.  
During  the  meeting  on  19-22  April  2010,  the  CHMP  adopted  a  revised  positive  opinion  for 
granting a conditional Marketing Authorisation to Votrient on 22 April 2010 based on Article 2(1) 
of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006,  i.e.  medicinal  product  which  aims  at  the  treatment,  the 
prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1  Introduction 
Approximately  59,000  new  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  cases  and  27,000  RCC  related  deaths  occur 
each  year  in  the  European  Union  (EU).  The  incidence  of  RCC  increases  with  age  and  nearly  three-
quarters of the patients diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 79. The incidence of RCC is higher in 
men than in women. Approximately 60% of all RCC cases are diagnosed at the localized stage, usually 
due to incidental findings on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI).  The  incidence  of  advanced  stage  and  unstaged  disease,  however,  is  increasing  and 
approximately  20%  of  RCC  patients  have  metastatic  disease  at  initial  diagnosis  and  roughly  20%  to 
40% of patients diagnosed with localized tumor subsequently develop metastases.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010

The  current  standard  of  care  for  RCC  is  nephrectomy  followed  by  systemic  therapy  for  metastatic 
disease. The median survival for subjects with metastatic disease treated with conventional (cytokine-
based) therapy is 10-13  months. The systemic treatments of advanced  RCC have improved in recent 
years  following  a  better  understanding  of  the  biology  of  RCC  and  development  of  several  targeted 
agents  including  sunitinib,  sorafenib,  temsirolimus,  everolimus  and  bevacizumab.  Overexpression  of 
proteins targeted by these agents including VEGF, VEGFRs, and PDGFR has been identified in the vast 
majority  of  subjects  with  clear  cell  RCC.  These  features  are  associated  with  increased  angiogenesis, 
advanced tumor stage, aggressive phenotype, and poor survival and are therefore currently considered 
valid targets for the treatment of RCC. 
This is a Centralised Marketing Authorisation Application under article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC for 
pazopanib  (Votrient)  200  mg  and  400  mg  film-coated  tablets.  Pazopanib  was  granted  Orphan  Drug 
Designation for RCC, based on the criterion of significant benefit, on 21 June 2006 (Orphan Medicinal 
Product Number: EU/3/06/382). 
In connection with the review of the orphan designation criteria by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) at its meeting of 7-8 April 2010, the Applicant requested the Commission to remove 
the product from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products on 7 April 2010. 
Pazopanib  is  an  oral  angiogenesis  inhibitor  targeting  the  tyrosine  kinase  activity  associated  with 
vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  (VEGFR)-1,  -2 and -3,  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
receptor  (PDGFR)-α,  and  PDGFR–β,  and  stem  cell  factor  receptor  (c-KIT).  The  recommended  dose  of 
pazopanib is 800 mg once daily. 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
‘Votrient is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)’ 
The approved indication is: 
‘Votrient is indicated for the first line treatment of advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and for 
patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease.’ 
The EMA has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Votrient in all subsets of the 
paediatric population in renal cell carcinoma as the condition does not normally occur in the paediatric 
population. 
The  applicant  has  received  central  Protocol  Assistance  by  the  CHMP  on  clinical  issues  in  December 
2006.  In  their  response  to  the  main  clinical  issue  the  CHMP  suggested  the  conduction  of  an  active 
comparator  study.  Clarification  advice  was  received  on  22  February  2007  maintaining  the 
recommendation  to  conduct  of  an  active  controlled  study.  A  second  follow-up  advice  was  given  in 
September 2007 on the design of study VEG108844 (a head to head comparative, non-inferiority study 
with  sunitinib)  and  on  study  VEG110324  (a  study  evaluating  the  effect  and  safety  of  pazopanib  in 
patients who have failed or not tolerated another available TKI therapy).  
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
Votrient is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 200 mg or 400 mg pazopanib 
free base as the active substance.  
Both strengths are capsule shaped tablets, plain on one side and debossed with an identifying code on 
the other side. The 200 mg strength tablets are pink, while the 400 mg strength are white tablets. 
Other  ingredients  for  the  core  tablets  include  microcrystalline  cellulose,  sodium  starch  glycolate, 
povidone  K30  and  magnesium  stearate.  The  film  coating  consists  of  titanium  dioxide,  hypromellose, 
macrogol and polysorbate 80. The film coating of the 200 mg strength also contains red iron oxide. 
Both strengths are packaged in white HDPE bottles with child resistant closures.  
Active Substance 
The  chemical  name  of  pazopanib  is  5-[[4-[(2,3-Dimethyl-2H-indazol-6-yl)(methyl)amino]pyrimidin-2-
yl]amino]-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide  monohydrochloride.  It  is  a  white  to  slightly  yellow,  non-
CHMP assessment report

hygroscopic,  crystalline  substance.  Evidence  of  structure  of  the  active  substance  has  been  shown  by 
elemental analysis, 1H-NMR,  13C-NMR, MS and IR, while the molecular structure has been determined 
by  XRD.  The  crystal  structure  has  been  determined  by  single  crystal  X-ray  crystallography.  The  solid 
state  form  selected  is  Form  1.    It  has  been  shown  that  the  proposed  manufacturing  process 
consistently produces Form 1 and that no conversion occurs during stability.  Pazopanib is very slightly 
soluble in aqueous solutions, being practically insoluble above pH 4. In order to improve its solubility, 
the active substance is micronized. 
Manufacture 
 
Pazopanib is synthesized in a four step process using acommercially available starting material. The 
choice of the starting material as well as the route of synthesis has been appropriately justified. The 
applicant has used risk assessment and Design of Experiments to identify the critical process 
parameters that affect the critical quality attributes of the active substance as well as to establish the 
operating ranges that will ensure the desired product quality. 
A detailed discussion has been provided concerning the potential impurities arising from the starting 
materials, reagents or the route of synthesis. Two of these impurities are controlled in the active 
substance specifications. No single structurally known organic impurity is limited above the limit of 
max.0.15% , which would require specific toxicological qualification.  
The solvents used in the synthesis have been shown to be efficiently removed during the purification and 
drying operations and appropriate specifications have been set to control their presence. 
Specification 
 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  particle  size  (laser  diffraction) 
identification  (IR,  chloride  counter  ion),  assay  (HPLC),  related  impurities  (HPLC),  total  viable  aerobic 
count,  bacterial  endotoxins,  residual  solvents  (GC),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.  Eur),  water  content  (Karl-
Fisher)  and  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur).  A  QbD  approach  has  been  followed  for  the  development  of  the 
analytical  method  for  the  determination  of  assay  and  related  substances  by  gradient  HPLC.  Different 
tools  such  as  fishbone  diagram,  Failure  mode  and  effects  analysis  (FMEA),  DoE  and  Measurement 
system  analysis  (MSA)  have  been  used  to  set  up  a  design  space  for  these  methods.    The  rest  of  the 
analytical  procedures  employed  to  test  the  active  substance  have  been  developed  using  a  traditional 
development approach. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for three production-scale batches, which were manufactured 
according to the proposed synthetic route at the commercial site and tested by the proposed analytical 
methods. All batches met the predefined specifications showing the proposed synthetic route is 
reproducible and can consistently produce active substance of the intended quality. 
Stability 
 
Data  from  four  production  scale  batches  stored  for  up  to  24  months  at  long  term  and  accelerated 
conditions in accordance with the ICH guidelines have been presented. Samples wee tested for assay, 
description,  particle  size,  water  content  and  impurities  employing  the  analytical  methods  used  for 
release that have been demonstrated to be stability indicating. 
In addition results from photostability and forced degradation studies have been provided, performed 
in accordance with the ICH requirements. 
In all cases no significant changes were observed at long-term, accelerated or stress conditions. 
Medicinal Product 
 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The design of the formulation focussed on the following needs: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To minimize the number of tablets per dose. 
To develop two strengths in order to be able to adjust the dosing to an intermediate dose. 
To minimize the tablet size, for improved patient compliance.  
To include physically and chemically compatible components.  
To enable the application of a robust and reproducible manufacturing process.  
To develop one tablet core formulation for both strengths, thus resulting in dose proportional 
tablets for the two strengths.  
To comply with compendial and any other relevant quality standards at manufacture and over 
the proposed shelf-life. 
To result in a dosage form that is al least stable during two years when stored at temperatures 
up to 30°C. 
Throughout the development of both the active substance and the finished product the applicant used 
the  principles  described  in  ICH  Q8  and  ICH  Q9  Guidelines.  More  specifically  the  applicant  used  risk 
CHMP assessment report

assessment  methodologies  such  as  Failure  Mode  and  Effects  Analysis  (FMEA)  and  Best  Route 
Innovation  Technology  Evaluation  and  Selection  Techniques  (BRITEST)  to  establish  those  process 
parameters and material attributes that are likely to have the greatest impact on product quality. The 
identified parameters and attributes were then further studied using Design of Experiments to identify 
their  effect  on  product  quality  and  to  establish  the  operating  ranges  that  would  ensure  the  desired 
product quality. 
The active substance can be classified as a Class II active substance (high permeability, low solubility) 
according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). This implies that particle size is 
expected to impact dissolution and thus bioavailability. Therefore the active substance is micronized in 
order to improve its solubility and to provide a more consistent particle size input to the granulation 
process. In addition, considerable attention was paid to the development of a discriminating dissolution 
method. 
Based on risk assessment, the following attributes of the active substance were identified as critical for 
the finished product quality; solubility, particle size distribution, identity, form, and impurities. 
Multivariate analysis (MVA) was conducted to evaluate the variability in the input active substance 
used for the manufacture of clinical trial batches. In all cases the manufacturing process could manage 
the variability in the active substance attributes providing finished product with consistent 
performance. 
For the formulation development standard pharmacopoeial excipients were selected that are commonly 
used in these kinds of formulations. Based on the scientific and prior knowledge of the excipients used 
in pazopanib tablets and on the risk assessment, no excipient attributes were identified as high risks to 
product quality. 
A standard wet granulation method was used for the manufacture of the finished product. Extensive 
development studies were performed to establish the critical process parameters that affect finished 
product quality.. A design space has been proposed for dissolution of the pazopanib tablets.  
The  pazopanib  tablets  are  packaged  in  HDPE  plastic  bottles.  The  plastic  packaging  materials 
components comply with European Directive 2002/72/ EC for use in contact with food. The HDPE bottle 
materials of construction comply with Ph.Eur. 3.1.3 on Polyolefines. 
Manufacture of the Product 
 
The manufacturing process is a standard wet granulation process and consists of the following steps: 
granulation; milling; drying; blending and compression. The tablets are then film-coated. 
All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
For control verification the use of continuous verification has been proposed rather than conventional 
validation. In light of the enhanced knowledge presented in the dossier for the process and the finished 
product and this was considered acceptable.  
Product Specification 
 
The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, 
identification  (UV  and  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (USP),  microbial  content  and 
dissolution. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data from 3 primary batches have been presented. All batches met the test limits as 
defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release. 
 
Stability of the Product 
Stability studies were carried out on 3 primary batches of tablets according to the ICH requirements. 
The  batches  included  in  the  stability  programme  were  manufactured  using  the  proposed  commercial 
composition and manufacturing process. Samples were stored at 25oC/60 % RH and 30oC/65 % RH for 
24 months and in 40oC/75 % RH for 6 months.  
The  parameters  tested  were  description,  identity,  assay,  impurities,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  and 
dissolution.  The  analytical  methods  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  testing  and  they  have  been 
adequately validated in order to be able to detect deterioration of the tablet quality. 
Tablets  were  also  exposed  to  ICH  photostability  conditions.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  in 
description,  pazopanib  content,  impurities  content  or  dissolution,  and  all  results  comply  with 
specification.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010

Stress  testing  during  12  months  at  5°C/ambient  humidity  and  3  months  at  50°C/ambient  humidity 
revealed no evidence of significant levels of degradation products. Also description, pazopanib content, 
and dissolution rate did not change and remained well within the specification. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  a  shelf-life  of  24  months  will  be  applied  to  the  product,  with  no  special 
storage conditions requirements. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
The quality of pazopanib is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and 
pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major 
deviations from EU and ICH requirements. 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in 
these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is 
commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard 
process  that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH 
guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
All pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations. Exploratory or range finding 
studies were not in accordance with GLP regulations. 
Non-clinical  studies  were  primarily  conducted  using  the  monohydrochloride  salt  of  pazopanib 
(GW786034B). All pivotal safety studies were conducted using the micronized monohydrochloride salt 
of pazopanib, which is the form proposed for use in humans. Some preliminary studies used the parent 
compound  (GW786034)  and  the  dihydrochloride  salt  of  pazopanib  (GW786034A).  Additionally, 
radiolabelled  salts  of  pazopanib  were  used:  14C-pazopanib  monohydrochloride  and  14C-pazopanib 
dihydrochloride.  
Pharmacology 
 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Potency and selectivity in cell-free assays 
The  in  vitro  activity  of  pazopanib  was  evaluated  using  the  recombinant  kinase  domain  of  various 
kinases.  In  cell  free  assays,  pazopanib  inhibited  substrate  phosphorylation  catalysed  by  human 
recombinant  VEGFR-1,  VEGFR-2  and  VEGFR-3  with  IC50  values  of  10,  30  and  47 nM  (see  Table  1). 
Moreover, FGFR1 and Tie2 were inhibited with IC50 values of 140 nM and 4.5 µM, respectively. Other 
receptor  tyrosine  kinases  involved  in  angiogenesis  were  inhibited  at  low  pazopanib  concentrations, 
such as PDGFRα (IC50= 71 nM) and PDGFRβ (IC50≈140 nM).

Pazopanib inhibited substrate phosphorylation catalysed by recombinant mouse, rat and dog VEGFR-2 
with  IC50  values  of  42,  17  and  17 nM,  respectively.  No  species  difference  with  respect  to  VEGFR-2 
affinity was present. The affinity towards monkey VEGFR-2 was not evaluated. 
Inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity in cells 
To confirm the biochemical activity of pazopanib in a cell-based assay, tyrosine autophosphorylation of 
VEGFR-2  after  VEGF  stimulation  was  determined  in  human  umbilical  vein  endothelial  cells  (HUVEC). 
HUVEC  stimulated  with  10  ng/mL  VEGF  exhibit  an  increase  in  tyrosine  phosphorylation  of  VEGFR2. 
Treatment  of  cells  with  pazopanib  inhibited  this  increase  in  receptor  autophosphorylation  in  a  dose-
dependent manner (IC50 = 7 nM). 
The cellular activity of pazopanib, sunitinib and sorafenib against VEGFR-2, c-Kit, PDGFR-β, and Flt-3 
receptors  was  evaluated  in  a  ligand-induced  receptor  autophosphorylation  assay  using  HUVEC,  NCI-
H526 (human small cell lung carcinoma), human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) and RS4;11 cells (human B-
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia). As shown in Table 3, all three inhibitors exhibit similar potency in 
suppressing  activation  of  VEGFR-2  and  PDGFR-β.  However,  sunitinib  showed  10-fold  greater  potency 
than  pazopanib  and  100-fold  greater  potency  than  sorafenib  against  c-Kit  activation.  Sunitinib  and 
sorafenib  both  potently  inhibited  wild-type  Flt-3  receptor  activation  with  IC50  of  1nM,  whereas 
pazopanib  was  1000-fold  less  active  against  Flt-3  with  IC50  ≥1μM.  These  results  are  generally 
consistent with the observed differences in binding affinities (please refer to Table 2).

Inhibition of cellular proliferation 
Pazopanib  selectively  inhibited  the  proliferation  (BrdU  incorporation)  of  VEGF-stimulated  human 
umbilical  vein  endothelial  cells  (HUVEC)  (IC50  =  21  nM)  while  it  had  a  less  potent  inhibitory  effect  of 
HUVEC  proliferation  stimulated  by  the  pro-angiogenic  growth  factor  basic-FGF  (b-FGF)  (IC50  =  721 
nM).  
In  a  3-day  cell  proliferation  assay,  treatment  with  sunitinib  and  sorafenib  induced  dose-dependent 
inhibition  of MV4-11  cell growth  with  IC50  of  5  and  4  nM,  respectively,  whereas  pazopanib  was  much 
less  potent  with  an  IC50  of  1.4  μM.  MV4-11  cells  harbour  the  Flt-3  internal  tandem  duplications 
mutation, which results in constitutive activation of Flt-3. These results are consistent with the reduced 
CHMP assessment report

potency  of  pazopanib  in  Flt-3  receptor  autophosphorylation  assays  compared  to  sunitinib  and 
sorafenib. 
Pazopanib  was  evaluated  for  its  ability  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  a  variety  of  human  tumour  cell  lines, 
HT-29  (colon),  MDA-MB-468  (breast),  PC3  (prostate),  and  A375P  (melanoma)  and  normal  human 
fibroblasts  (HFF)  growing  in  serum  containing  media.  Pazopanib  inhibited  proliferation  of  HFF  with  an 
IC50  of  1.01  µM  and  had  no  effect  on  the  proliferation  of  the  4  tumour  cell  lines  at  the  highest 
concentration tested (30 µM). 
To  further  investigate  whether  pazopanib  can  directly  modulate  the  proliferation  of  tumour  cells,  the 
compound  was  tested  in  a  cell  proliferation  assay  in  a  panel  of  282  human  cell  lines.  Of  these,  281 
were tumour cell lines derived from various tissue types, and 1 was a non-transformed breast cell line. 
IC50 values across the cell panel ranged from 0.01 to >10 μM. Only 7 cell lines showed an IC50 <1 μM: 
GDM1  (AML);  ARH-77  (myeloma);  NCI-H716  (colon  carcinoma);  G402  (kidney  leiomyoblastoma); 
CGTH-W-1 (thyroid carcinoma); A204 (rhabdomyosarcoma) and CML-T1 (CML). Hence, pazopanib is a 
weak or inactive inhibitor of proliferation in the majority of human cell lines tested in vitro. The anti-
tumour  activity  of  pazopanib  is,  therefore,  most  likely  derived  from  its  anti-proliferative  effect  on 
endothelial cells. 
The  effects  of  the  three  VEGFR  TKIs  on  human  bone  marrow  progenitor  growth  induced  by  multiple 
growth  factors  (GM-CSF,  Flt-3  ligand,  the  c-KIT  ligand  SCF)  and  combinations  of  these  were 
investigated. The resultant IC50 values showed that sunitinib is a more potent inhibitor of growth factor 
induced bone marrow progenitor growth than pazopanib and sorafenib. Moreover, sorafenib appeared 
to be a more potent inhibitor of Flt-3 and Flt-3/SCF stimulated growth than pazopanib. The IC50 values 
for pazopanib varied from 173 nM (GM-SCF + SCF) to 8984 nM (Flt-3). 
One  of  the  circulating  metabolites  of  pazopanib  inhibited  VEGF-induced  endothelial  cell  proliferation 
with  similar  potency  to  that  of  pazopanib.  The  other  3 circulating  metabolites  showed  at  least  10-  to 
20-fold less activity than pazopanib. However, in bFGF-stimulated endothelial cells, all the metabolites 
except one were more potent (IC50=0.79 to 5.5 µM) than pazopanib (IC50>10 µM). 
Inhibition of VEGFR activity in vivo 
Mice treated with PO pazopanib were at different times post-dosing IV administered with VEGF121 (15 
µg/mouse). Subsequently, the lungs were harvested 5 minutes later and analysed for phosphorylated 
and total VEGFR-2 levels. The densitometric analysis of the Western blots are shown in Figure 1 below. 
A  single  oral  dose  of  30  mg/kg  pazopanib  inhibited  VEGFR-2  phosphorylation  for  8  but  not  16  hours. 
This finding is consistent with the short half-life of pazopanib in mice (4-5 hours). Moreover, decreased 
VEGFR-2  phosphorylation  was  observed  in  murine  lungs  when  VEGF  was  given  2  hours  following  PO 
administration  of  10,  30  and  100  mg/kg  pazopanib.  Overall,  the  study  results  suggest  that 
approximately 40 µM pazopanib is required for optimal inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in mice.

Pazopanib  given  PO  at  ≥30  mg/kg  inhibited  bFGF-  and  VEGF-induced  angiogenesis  in  a  variety  of 
animal  models  including  the  Matrigel  plug  and  corneal  micropocket  models  of  angiogenesis  in  Swiss 
nude or C57B1/6 mice. Pazopanib also showed generally dose-dependent inhibition of aberrant ocular 
angiogenesis  in  laser-induced  choroidal  neovascularization  in  C57B1/6J  mice  (8 mg/kg,  PO)  and 
Brown Norway rats (2.25 mg/kg, eye drops) as well as corneal neovascularization in a suture-induced 
model in New Zealand white rabbits (0.1 mg/eye/day, eye drops).   
Anti-tumour activity in human tumour xenografts in mice 
The  anti-tumour  activity  of  21  to  46  days  of  PO  pazopanib  treatment  was  investigated  in  various 
human  tumour  xenograft  models  in  mice.  A  summary  of  these  findings  is  presented  in  Table  4.  The 
tumour cell lines were propagated in either Swiss nude, CD-1 nude or SCID mice (n=5-8 mice/group). 
The  tumour  cells  were  injected  SC  and  pazopanib  treatment  started  when  tumour  volume  reached 
between 100-350 mm3 in size (advanced stage).

The  anti-tumour  activity  of  pazopanib  was  compared  with  sunitinib  and  sorafenib  in  two  mouse 
xenograft  models  of  human  colon  cancer  (Colo-205  and  HT-29).  CD-1  nude  mice  with  similar  sized 
tumours (~250-350 mm3) were PO treated with pazopanib (30, 100 mg/kg BID), sunitinib (20, 40, 80 
QD) or sorafenib (15, 30, 60 mg/kg QD) for 21 days (n=8 mice/group). Pazopanib showed ~70% and 
sorafenib ~40% inhibition of tumour growth compared to sunitinib.  
 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Pazopanib  was  tested  at  a  concentration  of  10  μM  in  a  battery  of  49  radioligand-binding  assays  to 
evaluate its binding interactions with various physiological receptors and ion channels. These included 
adenosine,  adrenergic,  cholinergic,  dopamine,  endothelin,  glutamate,  histamine,  opioid,  purinergic, 
serotonin,  steriod,  sigma,  and  leukotriene  receptors:  monoamine  transporter  sites  (dopamine, 
norepinephrine,  serotonin);  and  ion  channels  (calcium,  chloride  (GABAA),  potassium  (Kv),  and 
sodium). Pazopanib did not significantly (>50%) inhibit the binding of any of the radioligands to their 
respective  binding  sites  with  the  following  exceptions:  adenosine  A3  (73%  inhibition),  adrenoceptors 
α2  (58%)  &  β1  (107%),  histamine  H2  (82%),  muscarinic  M1  (62%),  serotonin  5-HT1A  (71%),  5-HT5A 
(85%), and 5-HT7 (53%). 
Subsequently,  it  was  further  evaluated  whether  pazopanib  caused  β-adrenergic  mediated  changes  in 
force of contraction or rate in spontaneously beating isolated rat atria. Cumulative doses of pazopanib 
were  associated  with  dose-related  increases  in  atrial  force  which  were  not  blocked  with  propranolol 
(around  45%  increase  at  30  µM  and  10%  increase  at  3  µM).  Pre-incubation  of  tissue  with  pazopanib 
reduced  the  maximum  contractile  response  to  the  β-adrenoceptor  agonist  isoproterenol,  hence  a  β

adrenoceptor mediated effect cannot be excluded. There was little change in atrial rate with pazopanib 
(-5% at 30 µM).     
The activity of pazopanib was evaluated in a panel of 242 kinases. Sunitinib and sorafenib were tested 
for comparison. Compounds were first evaluated at two fixed concentrations, 0.3 M and 10 M.  At 10 
μM, a total of 94 kinases were inhibited >50% by pazopanib, while 147 and 82 kinases were inhibited 
by sunitinib and sorafenib, respectively. A sub-set of 61 kinases that were inhibited >50% at 0.3 M by 
at  least  one  drug  was  selected  for  IC50  determination.  Pazopanib  inhibited  31  kinases  with  an  IC50 
<1 M,  while  sunitinib  and  sorafenib  inhibited  53  and  25  kinase,  respectively,  with  some  overlap. 
Amongst  the  kinases  inhibited  by  pazopanib  (IC50<1  μM),  which  are  not  directly  involved  in  tumour 
angiogenesis are Abl (IC50=624 nM), Aurora-A (64 nM), c-kit (48 nM), c-Raf (92 nM), DDR2 (474 nM), 
KDR (15 nM), Lck (379 nM), MLK1 (21 nM), PTK5 (97 nM), Ret (232 nM), Tao2 (383 nM), TAO3 (181 
nM), TrkA (937 nM), and Yes (667 nM).

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The  effect  of  combining  PO  pazopanib  with  various  antineoplastic  agents  was  evaluated  in  xenograft 
models (data not shown). 
A  study  was  performed  to  investigate  whether  pre-treatment  of  tumour  bearing  mice  with  an  anti-
angiogenic  agent  had  an  effect  on  the  delivery  of  chemotherapeutic  agents  to  the  tumours  (data  not 
shown). 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  analytical  methods  used  were  appropriately  validated.  The  validation  studies  were  not  conducted 
in  compliance  with  GLP.  However,  they  were  performed  at  facilities  used  for  operating  in  accordance 
with the principles of GLP. 
  Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of pazopanib and/or its dihydrochloride salt has been studied in several animal 
species  (see  Table  6  for  results  in  cynomolgus  monkey).  The  terminal  elimination  half-life  was 
comparable  among  the  animal  species  (t½=2-6  h)  but  significantly  lower  than  observed  in  humans 
(t½=21-51  h).  The  peak  plasma  concentration  following  PO  administration  was  generally  observed 
within 4 hours post-dosing in all species including humans. High inter- and intra-species variability was 
observed  in  the  oral  bioavailability.  A  high  bioavailability  (>70%)  was  observed  in  a  few  individual 
animals.  The  oral  bioavailability  of  pazopanib  is  comparable  between  species  (e.g.,  21%    [range  14-
39%] in humans vs. 30% in monkeys).

  Distribution 
Following IV administration, pazopanib displayed a volume of distribution which was less than the total 
body  water  in  all  species  including  humans  (rats:  72-88%,  dogs:  49%,  monkeys:  39-41%,  and 
humans: 22-31% relative to total body water of the respective species). 
In  dogs,  a  rapid  drop  in  plasma  levels  was  observed  after  feeding  of  the  animals  regardless  of  the 
route  of  administration  (PO  or  IV).  Food  intake  had  no  significant  effect  on  pharmacokinetic 
parameters in monkeys.  
Following  single  PO  administration,  radioactive  pazopanib-related  material  was  widely  distributed 
throughout the body of rats. In rat, tissues exhibited their highest radioactivity concentration at a time 
point  similar  to  time  for  peak  plasma  concentration  (Tmax)  suggesting  rapid  distribution.  Radioactivity 
was not observed in most tissues 3 days post-dosing in agreement with the short half-life in rats. The 
exception was melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eye, pigmented skin and meninges) which suggest that 
a  selective  association  of  pazopanib-related  material  with  melanin-containing  tissues  takes  place. 
Moreover,  following  ocular  administration,  melanin-containing  tissues  of  the  rabbit  eye  showed 
relatively  high  concentrations  in  both  the  dosed  and,  to  a  smaller  extent,  in  the  non-dosed  eye, 
confirming  the  association  of  pazopanib-related  material  to  melanin-containing  tissues  following  both 
local and systemic exposure. 
Pazopanib was highly bound (>99.5%) to plasma proteins in all species including humans. Pazopanib 
was  very  highly  bound  to  human  serum  albumin  (>99%)  and  highly  bound  to  human  α  1-acid 
glycoprotein  (>95%).  Furthermore,  in  vitro  data  indicated  that  pazopanib  binding  to  albumin  was 
affected by the presence of fatty acids (e.g., palmitate) and some drugs (e.g., warfarin). 
A comparative assessment of steady state systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of circulating metabolites 
has been performed following PO administration of pazopanib to mice (100 mg/kg/day), rats (3 & 30 
mg/kg/day),  monkeys  (50  mg/kg/day)  and  humans  (800  mg/day).  Significant  exposure  to  the  main 
three  active  circulating  metabolites  has  been  obtained  in  the  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in 
mice,  rats  and/or  monkeys  (up  to  10-fold)  and  these  active  metabolites  are  considered  qualified. 
Significant exposure to a forth active metabolite (M24) has not been demonstrated.

  Metabolism and elimination 
The extent of metabolism of pazopanib was low in human liver microsomal and hepatocyte incubations 
as well as in most of the preclinical species. Pazopanib was more extensively metabolized by rabbit and 
dog hepatocytes than by those from the other species studied. Following PO administration, unchanged 
pazopanib was the predominant component in faeces from all species including humans. 
The  routes  of  metabolism  observed  in  human  liver  microsomes  and  hepatocytes  were  mono-
oxygenation,  di-oxygenation,  and  possibly  oxidation  to  a  carboxylic  acid.  Glucuronidation  of  a  mono-
oxygenated metabolite was also detected in human hepatocytes. There were no unique human phase I 
metabolites  observed  in  either  liver  microsomal  or  hepatocyte  incubations.  However,  a  phase  II 
metabolite, i.e., a glucuronide potentially derived from a carboxylic acid metabolite, was observed only 
in  human  hepatocytes.    Its  presumed  precursor  was  identified  in  vivo  as  a  significant  component 
(<19%)  in  bile  from  bile  duct  cannulated  monkeys.  In  conclusion,  the  combined  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
metabolic data indicated no major species differences in metabolism 
The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in rat, monkey and human following oral 
administration was via faeces with a minor contribution eliminated in urine. No significant difference in 
elimination or mass balance was observed between males and females. The metabolites of pazopanib 
were also eliminated largely via feces. The fecal metabolites together accounted for 1.45%, 14% and 
10% of administered dose in rats, monkeys and humans, respectively; whereas, the urinary 
metabolites together accounted for less than 1% of the administered doses in all three species 
After administration of a single oral dose of 14C-pazopanib, the majority of the dose was excreted via 
the faeces in rat (52 to 61%) and monkey (85 to 87%), with lesser amounts in the urine (15 to 17% 
and 2.3%, respectively. Biliary excretion accounted for 8 and 23% of the administered radioactivity in 
rats and monkeys, respectively. Most of the dose was eliminated within 48 hours post dose with high 
total recovery. A summary of the results is shown in Table 7.

  Pharmacokinetics drug interactions 
In human liver microsomes in vitro, pazopanib showed moderate to marked inhibition of CYP enzymes 
[1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 with IC50 values ranging from 7.9 μM (2C9) to 18 μM 
(2D6)].  There  was  no  evidence  for  time-  or  NADPH-dependent  inhibition.  However,  in  humans 
pazopanib  was  not  an  inhibitor  of  2C9,  2C19  and  1A2,  and  was  a  weak  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and 
CYP2D6; repeat doses of pazopanib (800 mg) resulted in a less than 2-fold increase in plasma AUC of 
the probe substrates. Similarly, coadministration of pazopanib with paclitaxel (metabolized by CYP3A4 
and  CYP2C8)  resulted  in  less  than  2-fold  increase  in  paclitaxel  exposure  relative  to  administration  of 
paclitaxel  alone.  Pazopanib  showed  moderate  interaction  with  human  PXR,  suggesting  a  potential  for 
CYP3A4 induction in humans. 
In cultured human hepatocytes, pazopanib also showed some potency to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. 
However, there was no significant CYP enzyme induction following repeat oral dosing in rats (up to 300 
mg/kg/day) or monkeys (up to 500 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. In humans, coadministration of 
pazopanib 800 mg once daily with paclitaxel or midazolam resulted in less than 2-fold increase in 
exposure of these two CYP3A4 substrates indicating no net induction of CYP3A4 by pazopanib. In vitro, 
pazopanib is also an inhibitor of human UGT1A1 with an IC50 value of 1.2 μM.

Pazopanib was shown to be a substrate for the transporters P-gp, BCRP and organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP1B1) in vitro. Pazopanib was not an inhibitor of human BCRP-mediated transport in 
vitro.

  Genotoxicity 
Pazopanib was tested in a standard battery of genotoxicity studies. Pazopanib was found to be non-
mutagenic and non-clastogenic when tested in a bacterial cell (Ames) assay, human peripheral 
lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and rat micronucleus assay (at concentrations or doses up 
to 5000 μg/plate, 200 μg/mL or 2000 mg/kg, respectively) (see Table 10).

The dermal toxicity and dermal irritation of pazopanib have been investigated in rabbits from acute 
exposure up to 28 days and in minipigs for 7 days. The dermal toxicity/irritation was not more 
pronounced than the vehicle. Systemic exposure was below the level of detection of the analytical 
methods used. 
Eye toxicity/irritation was investigated in rabbits (acute to 28 days exposure) and in dogs (acute 
exposure to 26 weeks). In the rabbit, pazopanib powder was a slight irritant, whereas no ocular or 
other findings were observed in the rabbit or dog with solution formulations. 
  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
The potential of pazopanib to induce hypersensitivity was investigated in the local lymph node assay 
with a maximal concentration of 25% w/w. Pazopanib was not sensitizing in the local lymph node 
assay test 
Metabolites 
The metabolites are deemed qualified based on the exposure in the toxicity studies. The circulating 
metabolites of pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation with similar or 10- to 20-
fold lower potency to that of pazopanib. However, in bFGF-stimulated endothelial cells, all the 
metabolites except one were more potent (IC50=0.79 to 5.5 µM) than pazopanib (IC50>10 µM) 
Studies on impurities 
Several genotoxic impurities have been identified by the applicant. The level of all these impurities is 
below the TTC level (below 1.7 ppm corresponding to 1.36 µg/day at the maximum recommended 
dose of 800 mg pazopanib) except for one. Following treatment with the maximum recommended 
clinical dose of pazopanib, the daily intake of this impurity is 0.1 mg/day (corresponding to 115 ppm), 
i.e., around 67-fold higher than the TTC level. The impurity tested negative in the Ames test, however, 
it tested positive in the mouse lymphoma mutation assay, mouse lymphoma cell cycle test, in vitro 
mouse micronucleus test and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. The in vitro mouse micronucleus 
test indicated an aneugenic mechanism rather than a clastogenic mechanism (showed by an increase 
in cells with kinetochore) and a dose of 0.2 μg/ml was negative, indicating a threshold dose 
Other studies 
-In vitro haemolysis testing in rat and monkey blood 
Pazopanib formulated for IV administration (containing Captisol, sodium chloride and phosphate buffer) 
at  concentrations  of  1,  3,  and  5  mg/mL  was  tested  in  EDTA  anti-coagulated  rat  or  monkey  blood. 
Following  incubation  and  centrifugation,  the  haemoglobin  concentration  of  each  supernatant  was 
determined. No haemolysis with the vehicle or with pazopanib was observed. 
-In vitro haemolysis and plasma protein flocculation testing in human blood 
Pazopanib formulated for IV administration (containing Captisol, sodium chloride and phosphate buffer) 
at  concentrations  of  1,  3,  and  5  mg/mL  was  tested  in  EDTA  anti-coagulated  human  blood.  Following 
incubation and centrifugation the haemoglobin concentration of each supernatant was determined. The 
simulated dosages tested in the flocculation assay were 0, 0.5, 5 and 25 mg/kg  of body weight. After 
mixing  with  plasma  nephelometric  turbidity  was  determined.  No  haemolysis  or  plasma  protein 
flocculation with the vehicle or with pazopanib was observed.

The  phototoxic  potential  of  pazopanib  was  evaluated  in  Balb/c  mouse  3T3  fibroblast  cells  in  the 
presence  of  ultraviolet  A  (UV-A)  light.  Fibroblast  cells  were  incubated  with  pazopanib  (0.00948  to  30 
g/mL; the highest concentration was limited by precipitation) or chlorpromazine (positive control; 1 to 
1000 g/mL) prior to irradiation (exposure to 4 J/cm2 UV-A). A second set of plates were kept in the 
dark  to  evaluate  effects  in  the  absence  of  UV-A.  After  irradiation,  the  plates  were  incubated  for  20 
hours  at  37C  in  a  humidified  atmosphere  of  5%  CO2  in  air.  At  the  end  of  the  incubation  period, 
cytotoxicity was assessed by neutral red uptake.  
A  concentration-related  increase  in  cytotoxicity  was  observed  following  treatment  of  cells  with 
pazopanib  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  UV-A  light.    The  cytotoxicity  profiles  in  the  absence  and 
presence  of  UV-A  light  were  similar  and  not  significantly  different  from  each  other.  Therefore, 
pazopanib was not phototoxic in this in vitro test system. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
  Phase I 
PECsurfacewater 
Based on the maximum daily dose of 800 mg/day, the applicant has calculated PECsurfacewater values 
using both the default Fpen of 0.01 and a refined Fpen. Using the default Fpen of 0.01, the 
PECsurfacewater becomes 0.4 μg/L, which is well above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. When an Fpen based 
on the prevalence of RCC (3.12 x 10-4) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.12 μg/L.  Assuming all 
patients are treated with the prescribed dose for 365 days/year, results in a PECsurfacewater with the 
same value. When an Fpen based on the estimated yearly consumption (4.46 x 1010 mg/year) and the 
defined daily dose (DDD, 1250 mg) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.08 μg/L. 
PBT assessment  
The applicant has performed an OECD 302C test and OECD 107 test in order to determine the inherent 
biodegradability and the log Kow for pazopanib, respectively. Pazopanib was determined to be not 
inherently biodegradable and is thus considered a potential persistent substance. A water sediment 
study (OECD 308) to determine the effects on sediment organisms should be investigated. Using the 
currently reported log Kow values the ion-corrected low Dow of pazopanib was determined to be 2.26, 
3.33 and 3.92 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively, therefore a bioconcentration study (OECD 305) is also 
warranted. 
  Phase II 
Based on the PECsurfacewater in the phase I assessment, a phase II assessment is required. The results 
for the phase II-Tier A assessment for pazopanib are summarized in Table 12:

In addition, based on the reported Koc value of 2.35, studies for the terrestrial environment are not 
necessary. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
No studies on carcinogenicity were submitted. Carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary 
for the current indication, advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
Pazopanib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits at 
exposures more than 300-fold lower than the human exposure (based on AUC).  Effects included 
reduced female fertility, increased pre- and post-implantation loss, early resorptions, embryo lethality, 
decreased foetal body weight and cardiovascular malformation. Decreased corpora lutea, increased 
cysts and ovarian atrophy were also noted in rodents. In a rat male fertility study, there was no effect 
on mating or fertility, but decreased testicular and epididymal weights were noted with reductions in 
sperm production rates, sperm motility, and epididymal and testicular sperm concentrations observed 
at exposures 0.3 times human exposure based on AUC. This information has been included for 
information in section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Studies with pazopanib in juvenile animals were not conducted. This is accepted since the current 
application targets an adult population. 
A synthetic intermediate in manufacture of pazopanib, which is also present in the final drug substance 
in low amounts, was not mutagenic in the Ames assay but genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay 
and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Considering the poor life-expectancy for patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma, the presence of a genotoxic impurity is acceptable. The presence of this genotoxic 
impurity in the drug product has been stated appropriately in section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Because PECsurfacewater exceeds the action limit, an aerobic/anaerobic transformation test in aquatic 
sediment systems (OECD 308) with pazopanib is warranted. The Applicant has committed to provide 
this information as a follow-up measure. 
In addition, as the calculated log Dow is 3.3 a bioconcentration study in fish (OECD 305) determining 
BCF and also assessing secondary poisoning is necessary. The Applicant will provide this information as 
a follow-up measure. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The anti-tumor activity of pazopanib in RCC was first demonstrated in a first-time in human study 
VEG10003 that was used as dose finding study. This study led to a phase II study VEG102616 and in a 
phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study VEG105192.  
The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  consisted  of  twenty  Phase  I  studies  that  have  either  been 
conducted  or  are  ongoing  to  characterize  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  pazopanib  in  subjects  with 
cancer including:  
- dose ranging pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (VEG10003) 
- characterization of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of pazopanib (VEG10004) 
- characterization of food effect on pazopanib absorption (VEG10005 Food Effect) 
- evaluation of drug-drug interactions (VEG10006, VEG10007, VEG102857 Phase I, VEG105427 Part 1, 
VEG105424, VEG108925, VEG109599, VEG109607, VEG110190, and VEG109693) 
- pharmacokinetics (VEG107200), and the rollover protocol (VEG105430).  
In  addition,  3  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  (MD1103367,  MD7110861,  and  MD7108238)  were  also 
completed.  Study  MD7108240  was  conducted  in  subjects  with  age-related  macular  degeneration 
(AMD) and is still ongoing. Study RES104031 was conducted in subjects with psoriasis using a topical 
formulation.  Of  these  20  Phase  I  studies,  several  are  currently  ongoing  (VEG105424,  VEG108925,

VEG105430, VEG10005 Crushed Tablet, VEG105427 Part 2, VEG105427 Part 3, VEG102857 Phase II, 
VEG109599, VEG109607, VEG110190, VEG109693 and VEG107200). 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
‘Votrient is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)’ 
The approved indication is: 
‘Votrient is indicated for the first line treatment of advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and for 
patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease.’ 
The recommended dose of pazopnib is 800 mg once daily. Dose modifications should be in 200 mg 
increments in a stepwise fashion based on individual tolerability in order to manage adverse reactions. 
The dose of pazopanib should not exceed 800 mg. 
Between December 2006 and October 2007 the applicant received protocol assistance by the CHMP at 
three occasions. Major aspects that were addressed regarded the design of the trials. 
Protocol assistance December 2006.  
In response to the applicant’s question whether the control arm of study VEG105192, applying best 
standard of care and placebo, would be an adequate reference comparator for pazopanib, the CHMP 
did not recommend initiating a placebo controlled trial. It was envisaged that ethical considerations 
(availability of other TKi and, eventually, VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab) could make benefit risk 
assessment problematic.  
Since there were at the time of protocol assistance data available supporting the use of sunitinib first- 
and second line and sorafenib second-line, the CHMP did not support the applicant’s proposal for a 
placebo controlled study, albeit that it was acknowledged that a head to head study with a VEGF TKi 
was not feasible at the time VEG105192 was performed. In response to the applicant’s question 
whether CHMP could agree with the registration package consisting of VEG105192, the phase II trial 
VEG102616 and extension trial VEG107769 to be supportive of  the indication advanced RCC in the 
first-line and the second-line population (after failure to cytokines) the CHMP considered this packaged 
not supportive and an active comparator trial was advised.  
Protocol assistance (clarification) February 2007.  
The advice regarded the ongoing pivotal study VEG105192.. The study was started prior to European 
approval of sunitinib and sorafenib, and therefore a placebo controlled trial was pursued by the 
applicant. In the advice it was stated that CHMP considered VEG105192 not a strong basis for 
acceptance. It was emphasized that OS data (as secondary endpoint) should be mature and supportive 
to the PFS data (as proposed primary endpoint), and not detrimental to results from the placebo arm. 
At that time it was emphasized by CHMP that it was unlikely that the evidence for a positive benefit-
risk ratio to support an indication for the treatment of advanced RCC in the first-line and second-line 
population who have failed cytokines, was obtained from the proposed registration package (pivotal 
study VEG105192 in combination with the phase II trial VEG102616 and extension trial VEG107769) 
without the results from comparative trials. The question was however a matter of assessment and 
outside the remit of protocol assistance.  
Protocol assistance October 2007. 
Further scientific advice was sought on studies that could fulfil the need for controlled studies on 
pazopanib with active comparator, as this was advised earlier. 
VEG108844 was designed as a phase III open label controlled study of pazopanib vs sunitinib in 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC. CHMP recommended double blinding. Issues on 
endpoints, statistical analysis and QoL assessment were also discussed. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Pharmacokinetics 
Pazopanib pharmacokinetics has been investigated in 18 clinical pharmacology studies, in either 
healthy volunteers or patients. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic study report and an interim 
study report on the ongoing hepatic impairment were submitted. 
Pazopanib  concentrations  were  obtained  using  3  different  HPLC-MS/MS  based  methods.  The  first 
method measured pazopanib in plasma over a standard range of 10 – 2500 ng/mL, and was used for 
the first 3 studies. The second method used plasma and increased the standard range to 100 – 50000 
ng/mL  in  order  to  analyze  samples  from  9  studies  which  were  anticipated  to  produce  higher 
concentrations.  The  third  method  used  plasma  and  increased  the  sensitivity  of  the  assay  giving  a 
standard range of 1 – 500 ng/mL in order to analyze samples from 2 studies which were anticipated to 
produce lower concentrations. Metabolites of pazopanib were also measured by HPLC-MS/MS. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters from plasma concentrations of pazopanib were routinely calculated using 
non-compartmental techniques. To evaluate the effect of a high- and low-fat meal on the PK of 
pazopanib, a 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric means for AUC and Cmax were 
calculated in drug-drug interaction studies and the food-interaction study. 
 
Absorption  
Healthy volunteers 
Limited data were obtained in healthy volunteers. In Study MD1103367, 6 subjects received 100 mg 
pazopanib once daily for maximally 14 days. The study was ended prematurely due to observed 
increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of >3 times the upper limit of normal in three subjects 
who received 100 mg pazopanib once daily. Two additional subjects were withdrawn from the study 
due to sinus arrest and blood pressure increase. There was no consistent correlation (positive or 
negative) between high or low systemic exposures and the elevated liver function values: AUC0-24h 
values in the 3 subjects that experienced ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal ranged 
from 11,0 ng.hr/ml to 112 ng.hr/ml, and Cmax values ranged from 867 ng/ml to 6.2 µg/ml. The range 
of AUC0-24 values observed on Day 1 in subjects who did not experience ALT elevation ≥3 times the 
upper limit of normal was 17,2 ng.hr/ml to 138 ng.hr/ml, and Cmax values on Day 1 ranged from 972 
ng/ml to 9.0 µg/ml. 
Patients 
Single dose absorption data at 800 mg were available from Studies VEG10003 and 10004. In Study 
VEG10003, single dose plasma samples were collected up to 96 hours post-dose. In this multiple dose, 
dose escalation study, adult patients with solid tumours received a single oral dose of pazopanib, 
followed by repeated oral administration for 22 days. Oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg three times 
weekly, 50 mg to 2000 mg once daily, and 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily were investigated. 
Following administration of a single oral dose of 800 mg pazopanib, maximum plasma levels of 19.4 ± 
13.4 µg/ml were obtained after median 3.5 (range 1.0 -11.9) hours, and an AUCinf of 653 ± 489 
µg.h/ml was obtained. Increases in pazopanib Cmax and AUC were less than dose proportional. 
Additional data are available from Study VEG20006 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma. These patients received 800 mg pazopanib once daily, and AUC and Cmax values are 
comparable with those observed in Study VEG10003. 
Bioavailability 
Absolute bioavailability of pazopanib was investigated in Study VEG10004. Seven subjects with solid 
tumour malignancies received a single 5 mg IV pazopanib dose administered over 5 minutes followed 
by blood sample collection for up to 96 h for the determination of plasma pazopanib concentrations. 
Subjects then received pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily for the duration of the study starting after 
collection of the last pharmacokinetic blood sample after IV administration. Blood samples for 
determination of plasma pazopanib were collected over 8 hours on Day 10 of once daily oral 
administration (study Day 15). AUC0-24h after day 15 was determined by setting the plasma pazopanib 
concentration 24 hours after administration equal to the pre-dose value. Pazopanib CL, volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss), and the absolute bioavailability (F) were reported only for subjects in 
whom less than 30% of AUCinf of the 5 mg IV administration was calculated by extrapolation (n=3). 
In the three subjects from whom IV AUCinf data were available, absolute bioavailability was 13.5%, 
21.4%, and 38.9%, with corresponding clearances (CL) of 0.206, 0.246, and 0.347 l/h (< 5% of 
glomerular filtration rate and <0.5% of liver blood flow), and steady-state volumes of distribution of 
11.1, 9.15, and 13.1 l (<40% of total body water). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010  
Page 26/76
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A mean of 67% of the administered dose recovered in the faeces as unchanged pazopanib suggests 
that maximally, approximately 33% of the oral dose was absorbed. This estimate of the percent of an 
oral pazopanib dose absorbed is consistent with the range of observed absolute bioavailability (13.5% 
to 38.9%). Given the median absolute bioavailability of 20%, the fraction of the orally bioavailable 
dose of pazopanib excreted in the urine as pazopanib and metabolites is ~20%. 
Influence of food 
The effect of food on pazopanib pharmacokinetics was investigated in study VEG10005 in cancer 
patients. Subjects in the randomized food-effect portion of the study received 2 single 800 mg 
pazopanib doses in the fasted state and with either a high-fat or low-fat meal. Blood samples for the 
determination of plasma pazopanib and metabolites were collected over 72 hours after administration 
of pazopanib.  
Administration of pazopanib with food resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in mean pazopanib 
Cmax and AUC values compared to administration under fasted conditions. Median tmax for pazopanib 
was greater after administration with food (6 h) compared to administration in the fasted state (4 h) in 
both the high-fat and low-fat treatment sequences. The CV% values for mean pazopanib AUC0-72h and 
Cmax were similar for the fed and fasted states within the high-fat and low-fat meal groups. Mean AUC0-
t and Cmax of several pazopanib metabolites also increased by approximately 2-fold when pazopanib 
was administered with a low-fat meal or a high-fat meal compared with administration in the fasted 
state. Median tmax values for all pazopanib metabolites, with the exception of one after administration 
with a low-fat meal, were greater after administration of pazopanib with a low-fat or high-fat meal 
compared with administration in the fasted state. 
  Distribution 
Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99 % with no concentration 
dependence over the range of 10-100 g/ml and to human α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG, >96%). After 5 
mg IV administration, pazopanib displayed a volume of distribution of 9.2-13.1 l (<40% of total body 
water) (VEG10004). In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. 
 
Elimination 
Elimination of pazopanib was investigated in Study VEG10004. Three subjects received a single 400 
mg oral radiolabelled pazopanib dose containing approximately 70 μCi of radioactivity on Day 1 
followed by blood sample collection over 168 h for the determination of plasma pazopanib and 
metabolites concentrations, and blood and plasma radioactivity. Urine and faeces were collected over 
168 h and total radioactivity, pazopanib, and pazopanib metabolites were measured. Subjects then 
received pazopanib 800 mg once daily starting on Day 8 for the duration of the study. In the three 
subjects from whom data were available, recovery of the administered radiolabelled dose was 85 ± 
19% through 168 hours post-dose.  
Pazopanib was mainly excreted in the faeces, with a faecal recovery of the radiolabelled fraction of 96-
98% of the recovered dose (82% of total dose) and a urinary recovery of < 4 % of the administered 
dose. The major component in faeces was unchanged pazopanib, accounting for a mean of 
approximately 67% of the administered dose. The mean half-life after a single dose of 800 mg was 
30.9 ± 4 hours (VEG10003). Following IV administration of 5 mg pazopanib, pazopanib CL in three 
patients ranged from 0.21 to 0.35 l/h. 
Unchanged pazopanib was the predominant component in plasma, accounting for 85% to 95% of the 
total radioactivity. The four principle pazopanib metabolites account for 6 % of the exposure in plasma. 
One of these metabolites inhibits the proliferation of VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells with a similar potency to that of pazopanib, the others are 10- to 20-fold less active. Therefore, 
activity of pazopanib is mainly dependent on parent pazopanib exposure. 
  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Pazopanib displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. In the multiple dose, fasted, dose escalation Study 
VEG10003, adult patients with solid tumours received a single oral dose of pazopanib, followed by 
repeated oral administration for 22 days. Oral doses of 50 mg to 2000 mg once daily were 
investigated. After single and repeated dose once daily administration, increases in pazopanib Cmax and 
AUC were less than dose proportional. Slope estimates for AUC0-24h and Cmax on Day 22 were less than 
1 and the 90% CIs of the slopes did not contain 1. Systemic exposure to pazopanib appeared to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010  
Page 27/76
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plateau at doses of 800 mg once daily and higher. Therefore, no further increase in systemic exposure 
to pazopanib is expected at doses greater than 800 mg once daily.  
In the same study, the ratio of means for AUC0-24h on Day 22 (steady-state) and AUCinf after a single 
dose was calculated for the once daily administration cohorts to determine the time dependence of 
pazopanib pharmacokinetics upon multiple dose administration. Mean plasma AUCΤ values on Day 22 
of daily 800 mg pazopanib administration were 743 ± 294 µ.h/ml, which was 1.45 (90% CI 0.75-2.79) 
greater than mean AUC0-24h values observed after single doses (accumulation ratios). There was no 
apparent time dependence over the 22-day dosing period within the 50 mg to 2000 mg once daily dose 
range. The mean accumulation ratios for pazopanib AUC0-24h values over the dose range of 50 mg once 
daily to 800 mg once daily on Day 22 are consistent with the extent of accumulation expected with 
once-daily administration of a compound with a t1/2 of approximately 30 to 35 hours. 
The interindividual pharmacokinetic variability is relatively large, i.e., approximately 40% for AUC and 
Cmax. 
 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Results from population pharmacokinetic modelling (data from subjects with baseline CLCR values 
ranging from 30.8 ml/min to 150 ml/min) indicated that renal impairment is unlikely to have clinically 
relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with 
creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised however in patients with creatinine clearance 
below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment the median pazopanib Cmax and AUC(0-6 hr) normalized 
to a dose of 800 mg once daily were both increased 2-fold compared to those in subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data indicated that the dosage of pazopanib 
should be reduced to 200 mg once daily in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. In addition 
pazopanib is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Data are not available in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Inhibition CYP3A4 
Results from Study MD7110861 indicated that co-administration of ocular pazopanib (400 µg) with 
ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, resulted in a 120% increase in AUC0-t (from 501 
to 1111 ng/ml) and 50% increase in Cmax. (from 13.2 to 19.6 ng/ml). The t1/2 was increased by 180% 
in case of ketoconazole co-administration. 
Oral absorption contributed to the systemic exposure to pazopanib after ocular administration (based 
on the similar tmax obtained upon ocular and oral administration of approximately 3-4 hours), and 
according to the applicant pazopanib oral absorption was not dose-dependent at doses of 800 mg and 
less. Therefore, a similar increase in systemic exposure to pazopanib was expected after oral 
administration of 800 mg with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
In Study VEG10006, pazopanib 800 mg was combined with the moderate, competitive CYP3A4, P-gp 
and BCRP inhibitor lapatinib 1500 mg. Pazopanib AUC0-24h and Cmax were increased by 59% (90% CI 
1.08-2.34) and Cmax with 51% (90% CI 1.06-2.16). At a lower 400 mg pazopanib dose mg and 1000 
mg lapatinib, no statistical significant effect was present anymore (point estimate (90% CI) for AUC 
1.17 (0.96-1.42) and for Cmax 1.08 (0.84-1.39). This effect may be caused by the moderate inhibition 
of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP by lapatinib 
Induction CYP3A4 
The effect of CYP3A4 induction on the systemic exposure to pazopanib was investigated in Study 
VG102857 in patients that received 800 pazopanib once daily, with CYP3A4 inducing anticonvulsants 
as co-medication. Mean pazopanib AUC0-24h and C24 values were reduced by approximately 30% and 
50%, respectively, after co-administration of either phenytoin or carbamazepin, as compared to data 
obtained in Study VEG10003. 
Currently a number of drug-drug interaction studies are ongoing.

The possible clinically relevant interaction between pazopanib and various CYP probe drugs was 
investigated in Study VEG10007. In this study, patients with solid tumours received pazopanib 800 mg 
once daily for 16 days. After 16 days, a cocktail containing specific probe drugs for CYP1A2 (caffeine 
200 mg), 2C9 (warfarin 10 mg), 2C19 (omeprazole 40 mg), 2D6 (dextromethorphan 30 mg) and 3A4 
(midazolam 3 mg) were co-administered. Pazopanib pharmacokinetics was mildly affected by co-
administration of the cocktail: AUC0-24h and Cmax were increased approximately by 20% with the 
cocktail co-administered. 
Results from this study indicate that pazopanib 800 mg once daily was a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 
(midazolam, 30-35% increased AUC and Cmax) and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan, 33-64% decreased 
metabolism) and had no clinically relevant effect on the probes for CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 
(warfarin), or CYP2C19 (omeprazole).  
 In Study VEG105427, pazopanib 800 mg once daily increased paclitaxel (80 mg/m2, a substrate for 
CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and P-gp) mean AUCinf by 26% and Cmax by 31% relative to administration of 
paclitaxel alone. 
 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
No studies have been submitted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  pazopanib  was  evaluated  by  measurements  of  relationships  of 
sVEGFR2  and  pazopanib  concentration  and  by  determination  of  the  relationship  of  pazopanib 
concentration and blood pressure. 
  Mechanism of action 
No studies have been submitted. 
 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In study VEG10003 (Phase I in adult cancer patients) pharmacodynamic endpoints measured prior to 
and during pazopanib administration included circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis (plasma VEGF, d-
dimer,  vascular  cell  adhesion  molecule  1  [VCAM-1],  E-selectin,  thrombin,  and  Factor  VIII  von 
Willebrand  factor  [VWF]),  dynamic  contrast  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (DC-MRI),  wound  healing, 
and  monitoring  blood  pressure  for  a  study-specific  definition  of  hypertension.  Clinical  activity  and 
biological effects associated with VEGF inhibition were observed more frequently in association with a 
steady-state  trough  concentration  of  ≥15  μg/mL  which  was  achieved  in  93%  of  subjects  receiving 
doses of at least 800 mg once daily. 
Twenty-one  of  63  subjects  (33%)  in  Study  VEG10003  experienced  at  least  one  drug  related 
hypertension event and 18 events occurred in subjects who received 400 mg to 2000 mg once daily or 
400  mg  BID  pazopanib.  A  relationship between  steady-state  trough  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations 
and  the  probability  of  the  occurrence  of  a  study-specific  definition  of  hypertension  (a  greater  than  or 
equal  to  15  mmHg  rise  from  baseline  in  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  on  at  least  three  separate 
occasions,  institution  or  escalation  of  anti-hypertensive  medications,  or  both)  was  described  by  a 
logistic  regression  model.  The  trough  plasma  pazopanib  concentration  at  which  there  was  a  50% 
probability of observing hypertension was 15.3 μg/mL (CV% 25.9). 
Study VEG102616 (Phase II in subjects with advanced clear-cell RCC) studied the relationship between 
the  pre-dose  plasma  pazopanib  concentration  measured  at  the  week  4  clinic  visit  and  the  percent 
change from baseline in the sVEGFR2 nadir in adult subjects received pazopanib 800 mg administered 
once daily (see Figure 2). Mean plasma pazopanib trough concentration was greater than the target of 
15  μg/mL,  suggesting  that  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  associated  with  clinical  and  biologic 
activity  were  achieved  in the  majority of  subjects.  Pazopanib  decreases  sVEGFR2,  a  marker  for  VEGF 
receptor inhibition, in a concentration-dependent fashion.

predicted with the Emax model). 
In study VEG104450 (ongoing Phase II in adult female subjects with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube 
or primary peritoneal cancer) subjects were treated with pazopanib 800 mg once daily. The primary 
endpoint was the biochemical response defined as a decrease in cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) of at 
least 50% from baseline confirmed. Plasma pazopanib concentrations were associated with clinical 
activity and biologic activity in 86% of subjects from whom data are available. However, a total of 31% 
of subjects experienced a CA-125 response to pazopanib. These results suggest that factors other than 
plasma pazopanib concentration likely influence the CA-125 response. 
A  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model  was  developed  to  describe  the  relationship  between 
pazopanib plasma concentrations and the QT interval using data from 2 studies.  In Study VEG10003, 
three ECGs (12-lead) were performed at the screening visit, at least 5 minutes apart and after at least 
a  10  minutes  rest.  ECGs  and  blood  samples  for  determination  of  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations 
were obtained pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after pazopanib administration on Day 1 and 
prior  to  pazopanib  administration  on  Day  8,  15,  and  22.  In  Study  VEG10005,  one  12-lead  ECG  was 
obtained at the screening visit after at least a ten minute rest. A 12-lead ECG and a blood sample for 
determination  of  the  plasma  pazopanib  concentration  were  obtained  at  approximately  4  hours  after 
pazopanib  administration  on  the  day  the  subject  received  pazopanib  with  food,  prior  to  the  second 
meal that was served 4 hours after pazopanib administration. 
Subjects  in  VEG10003  received  single  and  multiple  daily  doses  of  50  mg,  100  mg,  200  mg,  300  mg, 
400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, 1000 mg, 1400 mg, and 2000 mg pazopanib. 
Pazopanib dose levels in VEG10003 also included multiple doses of 50 mg three times weekly, 100 mg 
three times weekly, 300 mg twice daily, and 400 mg twice daily. 
Subjects in VEG10005 received a single dose of either 400 mg or 800 mg pazopanib. 
A  mixed-effects  model  was  used  to  determine  the  relationship  between  plasma  pazopanib 
concentrations and the QT interval. 
A plot of the QTcF values versus plasma pazopanib concentrations is displayed in Figure 3. There was 
no apparent relationship between plasma pazopanib concentrations and the mean QTcF interval within 
each  plasma  pazopanib  quantile.  Furthermore,  results  of  the  mixed-effects  modeling  suggest  that 
there was no relationship between plasma pazopanib concentrations and the QT interval.

Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
The key characteristics of pazopanib pharmacokinetics are summarised below: 
• Plasma concentrations of pazopanib peak from 2 to 4 hours following single dose administration. 
• Pazopanib is absorbed orally with an estimated absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 20% 
(range13.5- 38.9%). The relatively low absolute bioavailability is caused by low solubility of the drug. 
• Upon oral administration of a single pazopanib 800 mg dose to patients with solid tumours, 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of approximately 19 ± 13 µg/ml were obtained after median 
3.5 hours (range 1.0-11.9 hours) and an AUC∞ of approximately 650 ± 500 µg.h/ml was obtained. 
Daily dosing results in 1.23- to 4-fold increase in AUCT. There is no consistent increase in systemic 
exposure to pazopanib at steady-state when the dose is increased to above 800 mg once daily. These 
data suggest that absorption is limited by solubility above this dose. 
• Exposure to pazopanib is increased approximately 2-fold by administration with a low-fat meal or a 
high-fat meal. Pazopanib should be administered at least two hours after food or at least one hour 
before food. 
• Pazopanib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP, ABCG2), which are present in the gut and liver, and may therefore modulate pazopanib 
bioavailability. 
• Administration of a pazopanib 400 mg crushed tablet increased AUC(0-72) by 46 % and  Cmax by 
approximately 2 fold and decreased tmax by approximately 2 hours compared to administration of the 
whole tablet. These results indicate that the bioavailability and the rate of pazopanib oral absorption 
are increased after administration of the crushed tablet relative to administration of the whole tablet.  
The effect of other medicinal products on pazopanib has been adequately addressed in section 4.5 of 
the SPC: 
In vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver microsomes is 
mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Therefore, 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of pazopanib. 
Pazopanib is a substrate for CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. Co-administration of pazopanib with strong 
inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase pazopanib 
concentrations. Grapefruit juice contains an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may also increase plasma 
concentrations of pazopanib. 
Administration of 1,500 mg lapatinib (a substrate for and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and a 
potent inhibitor of BCRP) with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50 % to 60 % increase 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010  
Page 31/76
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and Cmax compared to administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone. 
Inhibition of P-gp and/or BCRP by lapatinib likely contributed to the increased exposure to pazopanib. 
Concurrent administration of a single dose of pazopanib eye drops (at a low dose of 400 µg (80 µl of 
5 mg/ml)) with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor, ketoconazole, in healthy volunteers 
resulted in a 2.2- and 1.5-fold increase in mean AUC(0-t) and Cmax values, respectively. Inhibition of 
P-gp and/or BCRP by ketoconazole likely contributed to the increased exposure to pazopanib. At 
present no dosing recommendations can be made for either potent specific inhibitors of CYP3A4 or 
ketoconazole. 
Co-administration of pazopanib with a CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP inhibitor, such as lapatinib, will result 
in an increase in plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration with potent P-gp or 
 BCRP inhibitors may also alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, including distribution into 
the central nervous systems (CNS). 
Combination with strong CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or selection of 
an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP is 
recommended. 
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration 
of pazopanib with potent P-gp or BCRP inducers may alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, 
including distribution into the CNS. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or 
minimal enzyme or transporter induction potential is recommended. 
In addition, the effect of pazopanib on other medicinal products has been adequately addressed in 
section 4.5 of the SPC: 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an in vitro 
human PXR assay. Clinical pharmacology studies, using pazopanib 800 mg once daily, have 
demonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
caffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 probe 
substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 30 % in the mean 
AUC and Cmax of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33 % to 64 % in the ratio of 
dextrometrophan to dextrophan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of 
dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 25 % 
and 31 % in paclitaxel AUC and Cmax, respectively. 
Based on in vitro IC50 and in vivo plasma Cmax values, pazopanib metabolites GSK1268992 and 
GSK1268997 may contribute to the net inhibitory effect of pazopanib towards BCRP. Furthermore, 
inhibition of BCRP and P-gp by pazopanib in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be excluded. Care should 
be taken when pazopanib is co-administered with other oral BCRP and P-gp substrates. 
In vitro, pazopanib inhibited human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1). It cannot be 
excluded that pazopanib will affect the pharmacokinetics of substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g. rosuvastatin). 
Administration of pazopanib with a high fat or low fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase 
in AUC and Cmax. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least two hours after food or at least 
one hour before food. Appropriate information has been included in sections section 4.2 an 5.2 of the 
SPC. In addition pazopanib film-coated tablets should be taken whole with water and not broken or 
crushed.

Clinical efficacy  
The primary evidence to support the clinical efficacy of pazopanib in advanced RCC is provided by the 
pivotal  Phase  III  study  VEG105192.  Efficacy  data  from  the  Phase  II  study,  VEG102616,  and  Study 
VEG107769 have also been submitted. 
  Dose response study 
The  recommended  Phase  II/III  monotherapy  dose  of  pazopanib  was  determined  in  Study  VEG10003. 
This  was  a  multi-centre,  Phase  I,  open-label,  non-randomized,  multiple  dose-finding  study  of 
pazopanib  in  adult  subjects  with  solid  tumours  who  were  refractory  to  standard  therapy  or  for  whom 
no standard therapy existed. Safety and tolerability of pazopanib were to be characterized in this dose 
escalation  study  by  determination  of  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  based  on  dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT). Dose-escalation decisions were made after all subjects in the previous cohort completed 
at least one 22-day treatment cycle and on the basis of the safety profiles observed during the same 
period.  The  dose  of  pazopanib  was  titrated  in  cohorts  of  subjects  based  upon  DLTs  within  the  first 
treatment cycle. 
A  MTD  was  not  achieved.  The  800  mg  once  daily  dose  of  pazopanib  was  selected  for  evaluation  in 
Phase II/III studies, including the 3 RCC studies, based on the following:  
- a manageable safety profile 
-  increasing  the  pazopanib  dose  above  800  mg  once  daily  did  not  result  in  a  consistent  increase  in 
systemic exposure at steady-state, so no further benefit is expected at higher pazopanib doses up to 
the highest dose evaluated (2000 mg);  
- a relationship between steady-state trough plasma pazopanib concentration and the probability of the 
occurrence  of  hypertension  was  observed:  the  steady-state  trough  concentration  at  which  a  50% 
probability  of  observing  hypertension  was  15.3  µg/ml.    Hypertension  has  been  associated  as  a 
pharmacodynamic  marker  of  VEGF  inhibition  with  other  small  molecule  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(TKIs);   
- five of the six subjects (83%) that had either a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as their 
best response, achieved a steady-state trough concentration of ≥15 µg/ml;  
- 93% of subjects receiving a dose of 800 mg achieved a target trough concentration of ≥15 µg/mL. 
- Changes in DC-MRI consistent with a ≥50% decrease in tumor perfusion (IAUGC60) was observed in 
10 of 11 (91%) subjects who received pazopanib at doses of ≥800 mg daily and 300 to 400 mg twice 
daily (bid). 
  Main study  
VEG105192 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of pazopanib compared to placebo in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC.

Subjects  received  either  800  mg  pazopanib  daily  dosing  or  matching  placebo.  Subjects  continued  on 
investigational  product  until  disease  progression,  death,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  withdrawal  of 
consent. Eligible subjects who progressed on placebo had the option to receive pazopanib by enrolling 
into Study VEG107769. 
Imaging-based  disease  assessments  were  performed  for  all  subjects  at  baseline,  every  6 weeks  until 
Week  24,  and  every  8 weeks  thereafter  until  progression.  Subjects  who  discontinued  investigational 
product  prior  to  disease  progression  were  to  continue  disease  assessments  according  to  the  pre-
defined  protocol  schedule  until  progression  was  documented  or  initiation  of  another  anti-cancer 
treatment. All subjects were followed for survival. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the PFS in pazopanib versus placebo-
treated  subjects.  The  principal  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  overall  survival 
(OS)  in  the  two  treatment  arms.  Other  secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  and  compare  the  two 
treatment arms for response rat (RR), rate of complete responses (CR) + partial responses (PR) + 6-
month stable disease (SD), safety and tolerability. Additional objectives included pharmacokinetics and 
quality of life assessments. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS, defined as the interval between the date of randomization and 
the  earliest  date  of  disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause.  The  RECIST  criterion  for  the 
assessment of progression of solid tumours was used. 
The  principal  secondary  endpoint  was  OS,  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  until  death  due  to 
any cause. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
 
RR (CR+PR).  RR was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a confirmed CR 
or PR per RECIST as their best overall response.   
 
 
 
Rate of CR + PR + 6 months SD 
Duration  of  response  (defined  as  the  time  from  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until  the 
first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first).   
Time to response (defined as the time from randomization until the first documented evidence of 
CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first).

Other endpoints included: 
Change  in  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQOL)  from  baseline  at  Week  6,  12,  18,  24  and  48,  using 
version 3 of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D).  
A  cross-study  IDMC  was  established  to  monitor  safety  and  make  recommendations  on  the  course  of 
the pazopanib RCC studies, based on reviewing of the pre-determined safety and efficacy data sets.   
An Independent Imaging Review Committee (IRC) was also established prior to study start to review 
all imaging for the assessment of subject’s disease status.  The IRC, which comprised of 6 board-
certified radiologists, performed a blinded review of all scans for randomized subjects according to the 
Imaging Review Charter. Two radiologists independently read each subject’s set of scans (double-
read), with a third acting as an adjudicator if necessary. The primary analysis of PFS was based on the 
disease assessments by the IRC as specified in the protocol and Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation for OS was based on 90% power to detect a 50% improvement in median 
OS with pazopanib treatment compared with placebo. Although the primary endpoint for this study is 
PFS, the sample size calculation was based on the number of subjects required to detect a treatment 
effect in the key secondary endpoint of OS. One interim analysis on OS was planned to occur after 
approximately 70% of the total events and flexible O’Brien-Fleming error spending functions for 
superiority and futility, this required accrual of 287 death events from approximately 350 enrolled 
subjects. 
Upon  amending  the  protocol  via  Amendment  3  to  include  the  treatment-naïve  subjects,  shortly  after 
the first subject was enrolled, the sample size was changed to 350 - 400 subjects to allow a minimum 
of 150 subjects to be enrolled for each of the treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated subgroups, and 
a minimum of 350 subjects to be enrolled for the entire study. The enrolment for each subgroup was 
not to exceed 250 subjects with a maximum of 400 subjects to be enrolled for the entire study. This 
sample size allowed at least 90% power to detect an 80% improvement in median PFS by pazopanib 
treatment in both the overall study population as well as in each of the treatment-naïve and cytokine-
pretreated  subgroups.  This  required  at  least  127 PFS  events  observed  from  each  of  the  subgroups 
based on the IRC assessment.  
The  clinical  cut-off  for  the  final  PFS  analysis  was  subsequently  modified  to  require  90 PFS  events  in 
each of the treatment-naïve and cytokine-pretreated subgroups and 160 deaths from the overall study 
population for interim OS analysis. The new requirement of 90 events in each of the treatment-naïve 
and cytokine-pretreated subgroups corresponds to ~80% power to detect an improvement of 80% in 
PFS and 90% power to detect an improvement of 100% in PFS.  Reducing the number of required PFS 
events did not substantially effect the overall sample size requirements for the study because the total 
number of deaths required for the final OS analysis did not change. 
All sample size calculations were performed assuming 2.5% one-sided alpha. 
Randomisation 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  of  pazopanib:  placebo.  Eligible  subjects  were  first  stratified 
according  to  the  following  stratification  factors:  1) prior  systemic  therapy:  treatment-naïve  vs. 
cytokine-pretreated; 2) baseline ECOG PS 0 vs. 1; and 3) prior nephrectomy status: yes vs. no.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as a double-blind trial with an IRC established to centrally evaluate imaging 
from all study subjects in a blinded fashion, based on RECIST. The central review by the IRC was 
completed prior to database freeze and unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population was the primary population used for the analysis of efficacy data. 
The  ITT  population  comprised  all  randomized  subjects  which  were  analyzed  based  on  the  assigned 
randomized treatment. Sub-populations of interest, including treatment-naïve and cytokine-pretreated 
subgroups, were also analyzed as pre-specified in the RAP.

The primary analysis of PFS was performed using the data from the IRC review of the imaging scans. 
Imaging assessments were performed every six weeks prior to Week 24 and every 8 weeks thereafter 
or  as  clinically  indicated.  Subjects  were  censored,  using  the  previous  adequate  assessment  if  the 
subject had not progressed prior to the clinical cut-off, or if another anti-cancer therapy was initiated 
prior  to  progression,  or  if  the  subject’s  PFS  event  (progression  or  death)  occurred  after  an  extended 
period of inadequate assessment (PFS event occurred more than 12 weeks after the previous adequate 
assessment). Subjects without an adequate baseline assessment were censored at randomization. 
PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared between treatment arms using 
a stratified log-rank test. The three stratification factors (baseline ECOG PS, prior nephrectomy status 
and  prior  systemic  treatment)  were  to  be  incorporated  according  to  the  analysis  plan.  Significance 
tests were conducted for the ITT population and also for the treatment-naïve and cytokine-pretreated 
subgroups. The Pike estimator of the treatment HR was calculated, together with a 95% CI. 
For  each  treatment  group,  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  for  the  median  PFS,  and  the  first  and  third 
quartiles  were  presented,  along  with  approximate  95%  CIs  if  there  were  a  sufficient  number  of 
progressions or deaths. Greenwood’s formula was used to calculate the standard error of the estimates 
from the Kaplan-Meier curve. 
Nine pre-specified sensitivity analyses that were performed in the analysis of PFS (see Table 13).

The same analysis methods as for the primary analysis were used except where specified (sensitivity 
analysis  2:  unadjusted  for  stratification  factors,  and  sensitivity  analyses  8  and  9:  Cox  regression 
analysis). 
Subgroup  analyses  of  PFS  were  performed  for  the  pre-specified  subgroups  of:  treatment-naïve, 
cytokine-  pretreated,  Memorial  Sloane-Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  Favourable  risk  category, 
MSKCC Intermediate risk category, ECOG PS 0, ECOG PS 1, gender and age (<65 years, ≥65 years), 
using the data from the IRC assessments. The study was designed to have sufficient power to detect a 
treatment  effect  in  the  treatment-naïve  and  cytokine-pretreated  subgroups.    Analysis  by  race 
subgroups was planned.  
The secondary endpoint OS was analyzed similarly to the primary analysis of PFS. The OS analysis in 
this  report  is  an  interim  analysis.  One-sided  p-values  were  to  be  compared  to  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
error  spending  boundaries  in  order  to  determine  superiority  or  futility.  Updated  boundaries  based  on

the  exact  percentage  of  information  collected  for  the  interim  analysis  were  calculated  using  East® 
software.  The initial analysis was performed by a Statistical Data Analysis Center and provided to the 
IDMC. The final analysis will be performed by GSK after 287 total deaths have accrued. 
In  order  to  analyze  the  robustness  of  the  OS  results,  several  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on 
the overall ITT population. 
Unadjusted  Analysis:  The  unadjusted  Pike  estimator  and  standard  log-rank  p-value  were  produced, 
along with the Wilcoxon p-value. 
Cox  Analysis:  OS  was  also  analyzed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression  analyses.  The  Cox 
analysis  was  performed  with  and  without  including  the  stratification  factors  as  covariates.    The 
summaries of the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses included HRs, 95% CIs, and p-values 
for the treatment effect and each of the stratification factors.   
Subgroup analyses were performed to understand the OS treatment differences in different subgroups 
(treatment-naïve  versus  cytokine-pretreated,  MSKCC  risk  categories  of  favourable  and  intermediate). 
In  addition,  an  analysis  excluding  subjects  with  post-study  therapy  was  performed.  The  analysis 
summary  tables  included  Pike  estimators  and  naïve  95%  CI  as  well  as  p-values  associated  with  the 
log-rank test. 
Separate analyses on the response secondary endpoints were performed using the investigator and the 
IRC  data.  All  response  analyses  were  based  on  confirmed  response.  Response  was  confirmed  by  two 
methods:  Method  A,  where  bone  scans  were  required  for  confirmation  of  CR  and  PR  in  subjects  with 
positive baseline bone scans; and Method B, where bone scans were only required for confirmation of 
CR for subjects with positive baseline bone scans (i.e. not PR or SD). 
Response rates and the rates of CR + PR + 6 month SD were compared between treatment arms using 
a  Fisher’s  exact  test.  Approximate  95%  CIs  for  the  difference  were  calculated.  The  response  rates 
(best  overall  response  by  Method  A)  were  also  summarized  separately  by  each  of  the  stratification 
factors  (ECOG  PS  0,  ECOG  PS  1,  prior  nephrectomy,  no  prior  nephrectomy,  treatment-naïve,  and 
cytokine-pretreated). Duration of response and time to response were summarized descriptively using 
medians and quartiles.   
Health  outcomes  changes  of  the  mean  scores  over  time  were  analyzed  with  a  repeated  measures 
analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  using  baseline  score  as  covariate.  A  mixed  effects  model  was  used.  
Analyses were carried out using Proc Mixed of SAS. The final analysis covariance model was to depend 
on the observed data and ultimately the unstructured covariance matrix was selected. 
Summary statistics were provided for 15 domain scores at baseline visit, Week 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48, 
and  for  the  change  from  baseline  for  15  domain  scores.  The  least  squares  means  and  associated 
standard error (SE) of the changes from baseline are shown for each visit (Week 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48) 
for both treatment groups. Additionally, the difference between treatment groups along with the 95% 
CI and p-value were displayed.

Recruitment 
Enrollment started from April 18th 2006 to April 24th 2007. May 23rd 2008 was the clinical data cut-off 
date for this analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol underwent 5 amendments: 
- Protocol Amendment 1 (issued 31 January 2006): The protocol was revised to exclude symptomatic 
progression as a measure for determining a PD event. 
-  Protocol  Amendment  2  (issued  22  March  2006):  Major  revision  included  reducing  clinical  visit 
schedules for disease assessments from every 8 weeks to every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks; Clinic 
visit  schedule  for  safety  assessments  was  reduced  from  every  4 weeks  to  every  3  weeks  within  the 
first 24 weeks. 
These two revisions were implemented prior to the start of the study. 
- Protocol Amendment 3 (issued 09 May 2006): Major revisions and rationale included: 
1. Expansion of study population to include treatment-naïve advanced RCC subjects.  
The  initial  protocol  finalized  in  November  2005  was  to  enrol  subjects  with  advanced  RCC  who  had 
received  one  prior  cytokine-based  therapy.  Following  the  approvals  of  sorafenib  and  sunitinib  for 
advanced  RCC  in  December  2005  and  January  2006,    the  population  of  the  study  was  expanded  to 
include  subjects  with  treatment-naïve  advanced  RCC.  When  Protocol  Amendment  3  was  issued,  7 
subjects were enrolled into the study. 
2. Setting minimum enrolment targets for the overall study population and subgroups of interest, and 
reducing the number of OS interim analyses from 2 to 1. 
Due  to  the  inclusion  of  treatment-naïve  advanced  RCC  subjects,  prior  treatment  was  added  as  a 
stratification  factor  and  the  protocol  was  amended  to  enrol  a  minimum  of  150 subjects  for  each 
treatment-naïve  and  cytokine-pretreated  subgroup  and  a  minimum  of  350  subjects  for  the  entire 
study,  with  the  total  enrolment  target  set  for  350  to  400.  This  was  to  ensure  90%  power  to  assess 
80% improvement in median PFS in each of the subgroups as well as in the overall study population. 
This  required  a  minimum  of  127 PD  events  to  be  achieved  from  each  subgroup  prior  to  the  final  PFS 
analysis. 
3. Allow crossover of subjects in the placebo arm to receive pazopanib treatment as a treatment option 
through the open label extension study VEG107769. 
- Protocol Amendment 4 (issued 07 August 2006): Revision made to include treatment-naïve subjects 
in  countries  where  cytokines  were  approved  but  were  not  considered  as  an  effective  therapy  for 
advanced RCC by the medical community where the standard treatment was best supportive care. 
-Protocol Amendment 5 (issued 23 May 2007): Revision made to update pazopanib safety and efficacy 
data  from  other  pazopanib  studies  and  to  provide  detailed  instructions  for  dose  modification  for  liver 
toxicity. There was a minor revision to the sensitivity analysis. 
-  Revision  on  Clinical  Cutoff  Timing  for  the  Final  PFS  Analysis  and  Rationale:  Prior  to  unblinding,  the 
timing of the planned final PFS analysis was changed to a time point when at least 90 PFS events had 
occurred in each subpopulation as determined by independent review. Additionally, a requirement was 
added that at least 160 out of the 287 planned overall survival events had accrued at the time of this 
analysis.

Disease  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  the  treatment-naïve  and  cytokine-pre-treated 
subjects. The time since diagnosis of Stage IV disease was longer in the cytokine-pretreated subgroups 
compared with the treatment-naïve subgroups (see Table 15).

a.  As defined by the Investigator 
b.  61 of the assignments in the treatment-naïve subgroup and 47 in the cytokine-pretreated 
subgroup required the use of total calcium measurements because of missing baseline albumin 
levels for calculation of corrected calcium. 
c.  Subjects with an unknown MSKCC risk category were missing results for one or more of the 5 risk 
criteria. 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT population was the primary population used for the analysis of efficacy data. There were 233 
treatment-naïve subjects (54% of total) and 202 cytokine-pretreated subjects (46% of total) enrolled 
in  the  study.  The  percentages  of  treatment  naïve  and  cytokine-pretreated  subjects  between  the  two 
arms were balanced due to stratification (see Table 16).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint (PFS) 
In the  ITT population a clinically and statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in the 
pazopanib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm,  with  an  HR  of  0.46  (95%  CI,  0.34  to  0.62, 
p <0.0000001) (Figure 4, Table 17). Median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4, 12.9) in the pazopanib 
arm compared with 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8, 4.2) in the placebo arm (Table 17).

Note:  The  date  of  progression  or  censoring  was  based  on  the  protocol-defined  assessment  schedule 
(not the actual scan dates).  A sensitivity analysis using the actual scan date was performed. 
a. Subjects were classified as censored with follow-up ended if their progression event occurred after a 
period  of  extended  inadequate  assessment  or  if  they  withdrew  from  the  study  prior  to  disease 
progression.   
b. Subjects were classified as censored with follow-up ongoing if the subjects were still on-study and 
progression-free at their last disease assessment. 
c. Quartiles estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. 
d. Hazard ratios were estimated using a Pike estimator. A hazard ratio <1 indicates a lower risk with 
pazopanib compared with placebo.  The hazard ratio and p-value from the stratified log-rank test were 
adjusted for ECOG status and prior systemic treatment for Stage IV RCC at screening.

Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier Graph of PFS per IRC Assessment (ITT Population) 
By IRC assessment, the percentage of subjects who were censored with follow up ended was balanced 
between  the  two  treatment  arms  (31%  [90/290]  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  29%  [42/145]  in  the 
placebo arm. The majority of these subjects had ended follow-up because they were assessed as PD by 
the investigator and had no further scans. Other reasons for subjects having censoring with follow-up 
ended are provided in footnote ‘a’ of Table 17. 
The treatment effects of pazopanib on PFS were observed in all the subgroups analyzed (age, gender, 
ECOG  PS  and  MSKCC  Risk  Category)  and  they  were  consistent  with  the  primary  result,  HRs  ranging 
from 0.40 (95% CI, 0.24, 0.67) in the MSKCC favourable subgroup to 0.52 (95% CI, 0.33, 0.82) in the 
≥65  year  age  group  (Figure  5).  In  all  the  subgroup  analyses,  the  p-value  for  the  log  rank  test 
comparing pazopanib to placebo was less than 0.001. 
Secondary endpoints 
Overall Survival (OS) 
A planned interim analysis of OS was performed with a cut off date of 23 May 2008 when 176 events 
had occurred (40% of all subjects, or 61% of the events needed for the final analysis).  At the time of 
the cut-off date, 67 subjects (46%) in the placebo arm and 109 subjects (38%) in the pazopanib arm 
had  died  (Table  18).  Most  subjects  were  still  being  followed  for  survival  and  were  censored  for  these 
analyses.  In  addition,  2%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  and  4%  of  subjects  in  the  pazopanib  arm 
were  no  longer  being  followed  for  survival  but  were  alive  when  their  follow-up  ended  (the  subjects 
were lost to follow up or had withdrawn consent to remain in the study). 
OS appeared to be prolonged in the pazopanib arm compared with the placebo arm (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 
0.53, 1.00; 99.16% CI: 0.47, 1.12; one sided p=0.020; Table 18, Figure 5). However, the results did 
not  reach  the  pre-specified  O’Brien-Fleming  significance  level  for  the  interim  analysis  (one-sided 
p0.004 for superiority and one sided p >0.201 for futility).

Results  for  OS  were  analysed  by  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapies  received  after  discontinuation  of 
study  treatment.  In  the  placebo  arm,  89  (61%)  subjects  received  further  anti-cancer  therapy  post-
discontinuation;  70/89  subjects  received  pazopanib  as  the  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  via 
VEG107769  (see  Table  19).  A  smaller  percentage  (28%)  of  subjects  in  the  pazopanib  arm  compared 
with the placebo arm received further anti-cancer therapy post-discontinuation.

Response Analyses 
Response  rates  were  significantly  higher  in  the  pazopanib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (30% 
and  3%,  respectively,  p  <0.001).  The  investigator-evaluated  RR  was  similar:  36%  in  the  pazopanib 
arm compared with 6% in the placebo arm (p <0.001).  
The  median  duration  of  response  in  the  pazopanib  group  was  58.7 weeks  (95%  CI,  52.1 to  68.1 
weeks)  as  per  IRC  review  and  62.4  weeks  (95%  CI,  42.0 to  68.6  weeks)  as  per  investigator  review. 
The median time to response with pazopanib treatment was 11.9 weeks. 
The  RR  was  analyzed  in  the  treatment-naïve  and  cytokine-pretreated  subgroups  by  both  IRC  and 
investigator  assessments  in  VEG105192.  Overall,  the  RR  results  in  each  of  the  treatment-naïve  and 
cytokine-pretreated subgroups were similar to that of the overall study population and were improved 
in pazopanib-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects. 
Quality of life 
EORTC QLQ-C30: Results from a mixed-model repeated measures analysis for change from baseline 
consistently shows no statistical difference between pazopanib and placebo arms at each assessment 
time point in global health status/HRQOL. Additionally, the between-group differences are smaller than 
MID of 5 to 10. 
EuroQoL-5D:  Results  from  a  mixed-model  repeated  measures  analysis  for  change  from  baseline 
consistently shows  no  statistical  difference  between  pazopanib  and  placebo  arms  at  each  assessment 
time point in EQ-5D utility score. Additionally, the between group differences are smaller than MID of 
0.08.  The  within-group  differences  were  also  smaller  than  MID,  suggesting  that  either  declines  or 
improvement from baseline were not clinically meaningful in either arm. No differences were observed 
either using EQ-5D VAS score. Additionally, the between group differences were smaller than MID of 7. 
The within-group differences were also smaller than MID, suggesting that improvements from baseline 
were not clinically meaningful in either arm. 
Ancillary analyses 
A  clinically  and  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  based  on  investigator  assessments  was 
observed  in  the  pazopanib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (HR, 0.44;  95%  CI,  0.34  to  0.57,  p 
<0.0000001).  These results are consistent with those by IRC assessment. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  was  explored  to  understand  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  to  using  a  visit-based 
approach instead of a scan-based approach within the two prior treatment subgroups.  Using the scan-
based  approach  the  median  PFS  in  the  treatment-naïve  placebo  subgroup  is  slightly  longer  at  2.9 
months  and  the  median  PFS  for  the  cytokine-pretreated  placebo  subgroup  is  only  3.2 months  (see 
Table 20. In contrast, the results using these scan date based dates for the pazopanib treated subjects 
in  these  subgroups  are  quite  close  to  the  visit-based  results;  the  median  for  the  treatment-naïve 
subjects is 10.8 months and the median for the cytokine-pretreated subjects is 7.5 months.

Sensitivity analyses investigated the effect of utilizing different criteria for assessment of censoring and 
progression,  and  analysis  by  Cox  regression.  In  all  cases,  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the 
primary  analysis  result,  indicating  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  with  pazopanib 
compared with placebo (Figure 6).

Sensitivity 1: actual scan dates for determining dates of censoring and progression (IRC) 
Sensitivity 2: unadjusted for stratification factors (IRC) 
Sensitivity 3: using earliest date of progression (including symptomatic progression); progression date 
based on the date of the clinical assessment of symptomatic deterioration as applicable (investigator). 
Sensitivity 4: using radiological assessments of progression only (investigator). 
Sensitivity 5: without censoring for extended loss to follow-up (IRC). 
Sensitivity 6: with adjustment for early investigator assessments of progression (IRC and investigator). 
Sensitivity 7: using alternative definition of adequate assessment (regular bone scans for subjects 
without positive scans at baseline are not required) (IRC). 
Sensitivity 8: Cox regression analysis (exploratory); Stepwise selection used to choose covariates from 
stratification factors, and demographic and baseline disease characteristics (IRC). 
Sensitivity 9: Cox regression analysis; adjusted for stratification factors (IRC). 
Covariate analyses were performed for the secondary endpoint OS using the Cox proportional hazards 
model.  The  effects  of  the  stratification  factors  of  baseline  ECOG  PS,  prior  nephrectomy,  and  prior 
systemic  therapy  were  tested.  Analysis  by  ECOG  PS  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.006),  with  a 
longer  OS  in  subjects  with  PS  of  0  compared  with  1.  Analysis  by  prior  nephrectomy  was  statistically 
significant  (p=0.004)  with  a  longer  OS  in  subjects  who  had  prior  nephrectomy  compared  with  those 
who had not.  There was no significant statistically effect by prior systemic therapy (p=0.931).

Supportive studies 
Supportive Study VEG102616 
The  supportive  study  VEG102616  included  225  patients  with  characteristics  similar  to  the  patient 
population  of  the  pivotal  study:  patients  with  advanced  RRC,  treatment-naïve  or  patients  who  had 
progressed  following  one  prior  cytokine  treatment.  Furthermore,  patients  who  had  received  prior 
treatment with bevacizumab were also allowed in this study. 
The  study  was  originally  designed  as  a  randomized  discontinuation  study  with  a  12-week  unblinded 
lead-in  phase,  after  which  patients  with  CR  or  PR  could  continue  unblinded  pazopanib  treatment, 
whereas patients with SD at Week 12 could be randomized to receive 12-week blinded treatment with 
pazopanib  or  placebo.  A  pre-planned  interim  analyses  assessing  the  Week  12  SD  rate  for  futility, 
showed a surprisingly high activity of pazopanib: For the first 60 subjects enrolled in the study, the SD 
rate  at  Week  12  was  47%.  In  an  ad-hoc  analysis,  the  RR  was  32%  per  investigator  assessment  and 
38%  per  IRC  assessment.  Based  on  these  results,  the  design  of  the  study  was  revised  into  an 
unblinded single-arm study. Following this change, the fact that 28 subjects had received placebo for 
various periods of time and might have had tumor enlargement during this time, had to be accounted 
for.  Therefore,  in  the  analysis  of  PFS  rather  unconventional  statistical  methods  were  used  including 
Kalbfleisch-Prentice weighted Kaplan Meier analyses and bootstrap CIs. 
The  weighted  analyses  taking  into  account  the  28  patients  with  SD  at  12  weeks  and  randomized  to 
placebo  is  a  fair  compensation  when  analysing  the  whole  material  as  a  phase  II  trial  of  continous 
pazopanib  treatment.  These  analyses  lend  support  to  the  pivotal  trial  regarding  the  overall  results  of 
pazopanib  treatment.  Moreover,  the  fact  that  PFS  was  much  poorer  in  the  28  patients  once  they 
shifted to placebo lends further support to the efficacy of pazopanib. 
Disease progression was the most common reason for discontinuation (57%). 
In the weighted analysis undertaken to estimate PFS (adjusted for the effect of placebo, see Table 25), 
the median PFS was 11.9 months per IRC and 9.9 months per investigator assessment. These results 
are  in  line  with  the  results  of  the  pivotal  study  VEG105192  (9,2  (7.4;  12.9)  months  per  IRC 
assessment.  
Tumor  response  was  a  primary  endpoint  in  this  study:  RR  per  IRC  was  35%  (95%  CI:  28.4%  to 
40.9%),  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  pazopanib  arm  of  VEG105192  (30%).  RR  per  investigator 
review was also similar (34% [95% CI: 27.6% to 40.0%].  
The  median  duration  of  response  was  slightly  higher  than  in  the  pazopanib  arm  of  VEG105192: 
68.0 weeks  (95%  CI,  53.7 weeks  to  not  calculable)  by  IRC  review  and  71.1 weeks  (95%  CI,  48.4 to 
87.7 weeks) by investigator review. The median time to response with pazopanib treatment was – like 
in study VEG105192 - 12 weeks. 
No major differences were observed in the results originating from US-sites contra non-US sites. 
In  the  55  subjects  randomized  to  either  pazopanib  or  placebo  treatment  at  Week  12,  the  results 
indicate that continuous treatment with pazopanib  is needed in  order to maintain efficacy as patients 
shifted to placebo displayed a marked drop in the PFS curves.

a. Subjects were classified as censored, follow-up ended if their progression event occurred after a 
period of extended inadequate assessment or if they withdrew from the study prior to disease 
progression. This may have been because of premature withdrawal from the study due to adverse 
events, withdrawal of consent, etc. In addition, if the IRC did not determine disease progression 
but the investigator had, follow-up for progression would have stopped, leading to censoring with 
follow-up ended just for the IRC.

Supportive Study VEG107769 
The  supportive  study  VEG107769  was  an  unblinded  extension  study  to  the  pivotal  VEG105192 
enrolling 71 subjects who had progressed on placebo in the pivotal study. The same enrolment criteria 
were applied. In addition subjects with an ECOG Performance Status of 2 were allowed inclusion. The 
primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  safety  of  pazopanib.  Regarding  the  secondary  endpoints,  the 
median  PFS  was  8.3 months  (95%  CI:  6.1  to  11.4  months)  per  Investigator  assessment  only,  the 
median  OS  was  16.8  months  (16.3,  NC)  and  the  RR  was  32%  (see  Table  26).  These  results  are 
consistent with the results observed in the pivotal study.

  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Votrient treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anti-cancer agents. The recommended dose of pazopanib is 800 mg once daily. Dose modification 
should be in 200 mg increments in a stepwise fashion based on individual tolerability in order to 
manage adverse reactions. The dose of pazopanib should not exceed 800 mg. Additional information 
on dosing in special population has been adequately addressed in section 4.2 of the SPC including the 
following statements: 
Pazopanib is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to 
insufficient data on safety and efficacy. 
A reduced pazopanib dose of 200 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Insufficient data are available in patients with mild hepatic impairment to provide a dose 
adjustment recommendation. 
In the RCC studies of pazopanib, overall no clinically significant differences in safety of pazopanib were 
observed between subjects aged at least 65 years and younger subjects. Clinical experience has not 
identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of 
some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 
Renal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics given 
the low renal excretion of pazopanib and metabolites (see section 5.2). Therefore, no dose adjustment 
is required in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised in patients with 
creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population. 
Pazopanib should be taken without food, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal (see 
section 5.2). Votrient film-coated tablets should be taken whole with water and not broken or crushed 
(see section 5.2). 
In addition, overdose information has been included in section 4.9 of the SPC. Pazopanib doses up to 
2,000 mg have been evaluated in clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. There is no specific 
antidote for overdose with pazopanib and treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive 
measures. 
There is a need to gain more understanding about the efficacy of pazopanib in terms of its effect with 
respect to other available medicinal products for the same indication. In this regard further evidence is 
awaited and two specific obligations have been included as part of the conditional approval. The 
applicant has already initiated a non-inferiority Phase III randomised, controlled clinical study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib versus the tyrosine kinase inhibibor sunitinib. In addition 
the applicant has agreed to perform a pooled analysis of data from study VEG108844 and study 
VEG113078 (a study to evaluate efficacy and safety of pazopanib versus sunitinib for the treatment of 
Asian subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma - a sub study of 
VEG108844) in order to provide robust clinical data to characterise the comparable efficacy and safety 
of pazopanib versus sunitinib. The combined analysis of the studies will be appropriately powered to 
demonstrate non-inferiority with a margin of 1.22 and a discussion on the applicability of the efficacy 
data from VEG113078 to the European population will be provided. The CHMP was of the opinion that a 
CHMP assessment report

step wise approach could be undertaken. Therefore should the upper bound of the 95% confidence 
interval for the Progression Free Survival hazard ratio fall at or below 1.22 in study VEG108844, the 
second pooled analysis could be considered an unnecessary specific obligation. 
In addition, the Applicant has committed to submit final overall survival analyses from both the pivotal 
study VEG105192 and study VEG108844 comparing pazopanib versus sunitinib as a follow up 
measure. 
Clinical safety 
As of the cut-off date of 8 June 2008 for this submission, a combined total of 1645 subjects (including 
healthy  volunteers,  subjects  with  various  solid  tumors,  and  subjects  with  psoriasis  or  macular 
degeneration)  have  been  exposed  to  pazopanib  in  clinical  trials,  including  16  monotherapy  studies 
(including  the  3  RCC),  6  pazopanib/lapatinib  combination  studies,  3  studies  with  healthy  volunteers 
and special populations, 2 studies of psoriasis and macular degeneration, and 6 studies in combination 
with chemotherapy other than lapatinib. 
The clinical database is comprised of the following subject populations: 
 
586 subjects with RCC who received at least 1 dose of pazopanib 800 mg as monotherapy in the 
pivotal  study  VEG105192  (n=290)  and  supportive  studies  VEG102616  (n=225)  and  VEG107769 
(n=71).  
977 subjects from 11 of the 16 pazopanib monotherapy studies (including the 586 subjects from 
the 3 RCC studies) who were analyzed as a group for events of interest. 
1155  subjects  with  RCC  or  other  cancers  who  received  as  least  1  dose  of  pazopanib  800 mg 
(which includes the 586 subjects from the 3 RCC studies). 
56 subjects from Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and elderly subjects who received at least 
1 dose of pazopanib (ranged from 0.4 mg to 100 mg). 
10  subjects  with  psoriasis  (topical  preparation  of  0.1  to  1%  pazopanib  ointment;  Phase  I  Study 
RES104031) and 15 subjects with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (eye drop formulation 
of 2-5 mg/ml; Study MD7108240) who received at least 1 dose of pazopanib.   
 
 
 
 
The  safety  population  for  VEG105192  comprised  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
investigational product (for this study safety and ITT populations were identical for both pazopanib and 
placebo  treatment  groups).  For  the  integrated  analyses  across  RCC  or  monotherapy  studies,  the  all-
treated population comprised all subjects who received at least 1 dose of pazopanib. 
Safety data from the 2 supportive RCC studies, VEG102616 and VEG107769 are based on clinical cut-
off  dates  of  24 March  2008  and  23 May  2008,  respectively.  For  the  pivotal  study  VEG105192,  the 
clinical cut-off date of 23 May 2008 was applied. Serious adverse event (SAE) data per the respective 
clinical cut-off dates as well as through the cut-off date of 8 June 2008 has been reported. 
 
Patient exposure 
Overall, the median duration of exposure was approximately 7.4 months (including dose interruptions) 
for  subjects  receiving  pazopanib  in  the  RCC  studies  VEG105192,  VEG102616,  and  VEG107769  (Table 
24). Study VEG102616 was the first study of the three to be initiated and had a median exposure of 
approximately  8.4  months.  Study  VEG107769  was  the  last  study  to  start  and  had  a  correspondingly 
shorter median exposure of 5.7 months as of the clinical cut-off date.  Study VEG105192 had a median 
exposure of 7.4 months for the pazopanib arm. 
For  the  3  primary  RCC  studies,  24%  of  subjects  were  exposed  to  pazopanib  for  >6  months  to  12 
months  and  32%  were  exposed  for  longer  than  12  months  (exposure  including  dose  interruptions). 
Values calculated excluding dose interruptions were similar and are also displayed in Table 27.

Adverse events  
The most important serious adverse reactions were transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, 
myocardial ischaemia, cardiac dysfunction, gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, QT prolongation and 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cerebral haemorrhage, all adverse reactions being reported in < 1 % 
of treated patients (see Table 28). 
Fatal events that were considered possibly related to pazopanib included gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, abnormal hepatic function, intestinal perforation and ischemic 
stroke. 
The most common adverse reactions (experienced by at least 10 % of the patients) of any grade 
included: diarrhoea, hair colour change, hypertension, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, dysgeusia, 
elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase.

 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the pivotal study VEG105192 serious adverse events (SAE) were reported for 24% of subjects in the 
pazopanib arm and 19% of subjects in the placebo arm (including fatal and non-fatal events). Diarrhea 
was the most frequent SAE in the pazopanib arm according to preferred term (n=6 [2.1%]). All other 
SAEs were reported for <2% in the pazopanib arm. More cases of SAEs of liver abnormalities, 
arterial/thrombotic events and hemorrhagic events were reported in the pazopanib arm compared with 
the placebo arm.  
Thirty-four (12%) subjects in the pazopanib arm and 3 (2%) subjects in the placebo arm had SAEs, 
which to the investigator’s opinion, were treatment-related. Treatment-related SAEs reported in 2 or 
more subjects in the pazopanib arm were diarrhea (2%), anemia (1%), hepatic function abnormal 
(≤1%), hepatotoxicity (1%), hypertension (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 
SAEs that lead to permanent discontinuation of investigational product were reported for 44 (15%) 
subjects in the pazopanib arm and 8 (6%) subjects in the placebo arm.  
Overall  in  the  RCC  studies,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  (including  fatal  and  non-fatal  events)  was  27%  for 
subjects  receiving  pazopanib.  The  most  common  SAE  according  to  preferred  term  was  diarrhea  (9 
subjects  [2%])  as  also  observed  in  Study  VEG105192.  The  pattern  of  SAEs  observed  for  the  RCC 
studies was similar to the most common events reported in VEG105192. 
Across RCC studies, there were 76 (13%) subjects in the pazopanib group who had SAEs, which in the 
investigator’s opinion, were treatment-related. This incidence is similar to the 12% rate of related SAEs 
observed  in  Study  VEG105192.  The  SAEs  reported  by  >1  subject,  which  were  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  treatment-related,  were  as  follows  with  the  percent  incidence  in  parentheses: 
diarrhea  (1%),  vomiting  (<1%),  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  (<1%),  large  intestine  perforation 
(<1%),  hepatotoxicity  (<1%),  hepatic  function  abnormal  (<1%),  jaundice  (<1%),  atrial  fibrillation 
(<1%),  myocardial  infarction  (<1%),  ALT  increased  (<1%),  AST  increased  (<1%),  anemia  (<1%), 
leukopenia (<1%), thrombocytopenia (<1%), pulmonary embolism (<1%), hypertension (<1%), and 
hyponatremia (<1%). A similar pattern of related SAEs was observed for Study VEG105192. 
Deaths 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 23 May 2008 for study VEG105192, a total of 176 subjects died during 
the  study  (67  in  placebo  arm,  109  in  pazopanib  arm).  The  primary  cause  of  death  in  both  treatment 
groups was cancer progression. Deaths due to disease progression were not to be reported as SAEs.  
In  this  study  the  incidence  of  fatal  SAEs  was  similar  in  the  pazopanib  group  (4%)  and  the  placebo 
group  (3%),  although,  the  causes  of  fatal  events  were  not  similar  (see  Table  29).  Fatal  SAEs  were 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  investigational  product  for  4  of  9  subjects  in  the 
pazopanib arm and for none of 3 subjects in the placebo arm. The events considered treatment-related 
included abnormal hepatic function and rectal hemorrhage, abnormal hepatic function, peritonitis and 
ischemic stroke.

Overall for  the  RCC  studies,  the  incidence  of  fatal  SAEs  was  3%  for  pazopanib-treated  subjects  as  of 
the  clinical  cut-off  date.  Seven  patients  died  due  to  SAEs  that  were  considered  related  to  pazopanib 
treatment by the investigators. 
Events of Special Interest 
Hypertension 
In  the  pivotal  study,  subjects  in  the  pazopanib  arm  had  a  40%  incidence  of  AEs  of  hypertension  or 
worsening of hypertension compared with 10% in the placebo-group. Dose reductions because of AEs 
of hypertension were required in 21 pazopanib treated subjects versus 2 subjects in the placebo arm. 
Nevertheless, severe hypertension was rare in the pazopanib arm. The treatment-related hypertension 
therefore seems manageable and it’s a well-known class-effect of VEGF-inhibitors. 
QTc prolongations 
In the pivotal study 3% of subjects in the pazopanib arm versus 2 % in the placebo arm had a post-
baseline QTc value shift from < 480 msec at baseline to QTc values of 480-499 msec post-baseline. 3 
pazopanib treated subjects developped a post-baseline QTc value of >500 msec. Only 1 subject had a 
manifest SAE of QT prolongation. However, one case of “Cardiac arrest” was reported in the pazopanib 
arm in study VEG105192. Across all RCC studies, 10 out of 558 subjects developed QTc prolongations 
>  500  msec  (1.8%)  and  1  case  of  “Sudden  death”  was  observed  in  the  group  of  pazopanib-treated 
subjects  across  RCC  studies.  Tables  30  and  31  summarise  the  results  on  QTc  prolongations  in  study 
VEG105192 and across RCC studies, respectively.

Cardiovascular events 
Treatment with pazopanib was associated with an increased risk of vascular events, specifically arterial 
thromboembolic  events:  In  the  pivotal  trial  10%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  6%  in  the  placebo  arm 
experienced  at  least  1  cardiac  and/or  vascular  AE.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  for  all 
cardiac and vascular events were similar between the 2 arms: 11.99 [CI 7.55, 16.43] per 100 patient-
years in the pazopanib arm compared with 10.22 [CI, 3.14, 17.30] in the placebo arm. In addition the 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate for Grade 5 events was higher in the placebo arm (1.28 vs. 2.55 per 
100 patient-years). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of non-vascular cardiac events and venous 
thromboembolic  events  were  also  similar  between  the  2  arms.  In  contrast,  the  exposure-adjusted 
incidence  rate  of  arterial  thromboembolic  events  was  higher  in  the  pazopanib  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo arm (3.85 [CI 1.33, 6.37] versus 0 ([CI could not be estimated] per 100 patient-years).   
The overall rates of cardiac and vascular events were similar across RCC and monotherapy studies. 
The applicant submitted updated information on cardiac safety following a report of congestive heart 
failure (CHF) received from a sarcoma trial that described positive dechallenge and rechallenge data, 
suggesting a causal association with pazopanib.  This incident triggered a review of cardiac failure and 
related terms was carried out using the GSK Worldwide Safety Database Database (OCEANS). Twenty-
one reports from pazopanib clinical trials were retrieved from the OCEANS database.  In four reports, 
including the report describing the positive dechallenge and rechallenge, a causal association with 
pazopanib could not be excluded. 
Hemorrhagic events 
As for other inhibitors of angiogenesis, an increased incidence of hemorrhagic events was observed in 
pazopanib-treated patients: In the pivotal study the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of hemorrhagic 
events was 15.85 (CI 10.74, 20.96) per 100 patient-years in the pazopanib arm compared to 8.94 (CI 
2.32,  15.56)  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  of  Grade  3,  Grade  4  and

Grade  5  hemorrhagic  events  in  the  pazopanib  arm  were  1.28,  0.43  and  1.71  in  the  pazopanib  arm 
compared  with  0  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  most  common  hemorrhagic  events  in  the  pazopanib  arm 
were  hematuria  (n=  11,  4%),  epistaxis  (n=  5,  2%),  hemoptysis  (n=  5,  2%)  and  rectal  hemorrhage 
(n= 4, 1%). 9 subjects in the pazopanib arm experienced serious hemorrhagic events (versus 2 in the 
placebo  arm),  out  of  which  3  events  were  considered  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug 
(retroperitoneal bleeding, hematuria and bleeding esophageal varices. 
Across  RCC  studies  and  monotherapy  studies  a  similar  pattern  was  found.  The  nature  of  the 
hemorrhagic  events  was  mainly  dependent  on  the  location  of  the  primary  tumour  and  associated 
metastases. Serious and potentially fatal hemorrhagic events were rare.  
Thyroid function abnormalities 
Changes  in  thyroid  parameters,  mainly  increases  in  TSH,  are  a  well-known  adverse  event  and  “class 
effect”  that  has  been  adequately  addressed  in  the  SmPC.  In  the  pivotal  study  32%  of  pazopanib 
treated  patients  experienced  a  TSH  increase.  Manifest  hypothyroidism  was  only  confirmed  in  4%  of 
patients. 
Bowel Perforations and enteral fistulae 
GI perforations or fistulae are rare but serious and potentially fatal adverse events of all inhibitors of 
angiogenesis.  In  study  VEG105192,  1  subject  in  the  pazopanib  arm  experienced  a  fatal  SAE  of 
gastrointestinal  perforation  and  peritonitis  which  was  considered  related  to  investigational  product. 
Two other subjects in the pazopanib arm had enteral fistulas:  1 subject had a Grade 1 anal fistula AE 
which  was  not  considered  related  to  investigational  product  and  another  subject  experienced  an 
enterocutaneous fistula of unknown grade, which was reported as an SAE and was considered related 
to investigational product. Neither subject was discontinued from investigational product treatment.  
In  the  RCC  population,  5  subjects  (0.9%)  suffered  SAEs  related  to  GI  perforations  or  fistulae.  The  5 
events  were  described  as  follows:  ileal  perforation  (n=1,  [VEG102616]),  large  intestine  perforation 
(n=2;  [VEG102616]),  peritonitis  secondary  to  intestinal  perforation  (n=1,  [VEG105192]),  and 
enterocutaneous  fistula  (n=1,  [VEG105192]).  Two  of  these  events  (large  intestine  perforation,  and 
peritonitis secondary to intestinal perforation) were fatal. One event of large intestinal perforation was 
associated with diverticulitis. Three events of perforation were related to underlying tumor.   
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria  is  a  well-known  AE  related  to  VEGF  inhibitors.  The  incidences  of  AEs  of  proteinuria  were 
similar between Study VEG105192 (9%) and the combined RCC study populations (8%). Most cases of 
proteinuria were mild in severity, but discontinuations of pazopanib have been seen due to proteinuria. 
The  applicant  has  provided  recommendation  for  subjects  who  develop  grade  4  proteinuria  (nephrotic 
syndrome) (discontinuation). Proteinuria is included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.

Laboratory findings 
Hematologic Assessments 
In study VEG105192 the worst case hematologic toxicity grade shift from baseline is displayed in Table 
32.  Most  toxicity  grade  shifts  were  to  Grade  1  or  2  in  both  groups.  The  incidences  of  leukopenia, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia with any grade increase were 37%, 34% and 32%, respectively in 
the  pazopanib  arm,  which  were  higher  than in  the placebo  arm  (6%,  6%  and  5%,  respectively).  The 
incidences  of  grade  increases  in  other  hematologic  parameters  were  similar  in  the  pazopanib  and 
placebo arms. 
Post-baseline  increases  to  Grade  3  in  any  hematologic  parameter  were  uncommon  in  both  treatment 
arms,  occurring  between  <1%  to  4%  in  the  pazopanib  arm.  An  increase  to  Grade  4  hematological 
toxicity was rare.

For the RCC studies, most hematology abnormalities were of Grade 1-2 severity and Grade 4 toxicities 
were uncommon. The incidences of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, and 
anemia in the RCC subjects were similar to those observed in the pazopanib arm of Study VEG105192.  
Chemistry Assessments 
In Study VEG105192 the most common increases in any toxicity grade for clinical chemistry in the 
pazopanib arm which were higher than the incidences in the placebo arm were ALT, AST, and total 
bilirubin elevation, which occurred in 53%, 53% and 36% subjects, respectively; these rates were 
higher than the respective incidences in the placebo arm (22%, 19%, and 10%) (Table 33). 
Other  clinical  chemistry  parameters  with  a  higher  incidence  in  any  grade  shift  in  the  pazopanib  arm 
compared  with  the  placebo  arm  included  low  phosphate  (34%  versus  11%),  hypoglycemia  (17% 
versus 3%), hypokalemia (9% versus 2%), and hypomagnesemia (26% versus 14%).  
Overall,  the  majority  of  the  toxicity  grade  shifts  in  clinical  chemistry  were  to  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  in 
both  arms.  ALT  and  AST  elevation  and  hypophosphatemia  were  the  most  common  clinical  chemistry 
parameters  with  increases  to  Grade  3  (10%,  7%  and  4%,  respectively)  in  the  pazopanib  arm  where 
the rates were higher than in the placebo arm (1%, <1% and 0%, respectively). A toxicity grade shift 
of clinical chemistry parameters to Grade 4 was uncommon (2% or less for any individual lab test).

For  Study  VEG105192,  routine  urinalysis  was  performed  at  baseline  and  every  clinical  visit  using 
dipstick for urine protein, red blood cells and glucose.  There were no significant changes in urine red 
blood cells and glucose levels from baseline in both arms. There was an apparent increase in the urine 
protein level from baseline in the pazopanib arm compared with the placebo arm.

Overall for the RCC studies, most clinical chemistry abnormalities were of Grade 0-2 severity. Similar 
to Study VEG105192, Grade 4 events for any of the analytes were infrequent (<1%). The incidence of 
chemistry laboratory abnormalities in RCC subjects was similar to the rates observed in the pazopanib 
arm of VEG105192. 
 
Safety in special populations 
In  clinical  trials  with  pazopanib  for  the  treatment  of  RCC,  196  subjects  (33%)  were  aged  65 years, 
and  34  subjects  (6%)  were  aged  >75 years.  No  overall  differences  in  the  safety  of  pazopanib 
treatment  were  observed  between  these  subjects  and  younger  subjects.  No  differences  in  the  safety 
profile, as assessed by AEs, SAEs, and hepatic enzyme laboratory abnormalities were noted based on 
gender. No safety concerns appear to be correlated with race. 
 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Studies  evaluating  the  safety  of  pazopanib  in  the  presence  of  other  chemotherapy  agents  were 
conducted. Studies VEG10006 and VEG102857 were conducted to evaluate the drug-drug interactions 
of  pazopanib  with  lapatinib  and  Study  VEG105427  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  drug-drug 
interactions of pazopanib with paclitaxel (data not shown). 
  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
For  Study  VEG105192,  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  were 
reported  for  44 (15%)  subjects  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  8  (6%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm, 
respectively. In the pazopanib arm, AEs associated with liver function/enzyme abnormalities (including 
increased  ALT,  AST,  hepatotoxicity,  increased  hepatic  enzyme  and  hyperbilirubinemia)  led  to 
discontinuation  of  investigational  product  for  11  (3.8%)  subjects.  Dose  modification  rules  in  the 
original  protocol  included  guidelines  to  discontinue  study  drug  for  recurrent  AST  or  ALT  Grade  2 
following 1 dose reduction. There were no specific criteria for bilirubin elevations. These were the rules 
in effect when most subjects were discontinued for transaminase elevations. The stopping rules were 
subsequently modified in Amendment 5 of the protocol (after all subjects had been enrolled) to include 
stopping  for  any  AST/ALT  >8xULN  or  for  AST/ALT  >3x  ULN  in  the  presence  of  hypersensitivity 
symptoms or concomitant bilirubin elevation to 2xULN.   
In  the  pazopanib  arm,  diarrhea  led  to  discontinuation  of  investigational  product  for  6  (2%)  subjects. 
For  3  of  the  44  subjects  in  the  pazopanib  arm  with  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  the  investigator 
indicated that the reason for discontinuation was ‘other’ since the investigator considered that disease 
progression also contributed to discontinuation. 
Across  RCC  studies,  86  (15%)  pazopanib-treated  subjects  experienced  AEs leading  to  discontinuation 
or  withdrawal  from  study.  The  most  common  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  was  ALT  increased  (10 
subjects,  2%).  The  next  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  were  diarrhea, 
AST  increased,  and  asthenia.  AEs  associated  with  liver  function/enzyme  abnormalities  led  to 
discontinuation of investigational product for 23 (3.9%) subjects. This is a similar pattern as observed 
for Study VEG105192. Comparison of treatment-naïve subjects with subjects reporting at least 1 prior 
systemic  therapy  revealed  no  trend  for  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  investigational 
product discontinuation. 
In the pivotal study more subjects in the pazopanib arm compared to the placebo arm had AEs that led 
to dose reductions (24% versus 3%). The most common AEs that led to dose reductions were 
hypertension and diarrhea. There were also more AEs leading to dose interruptions in the pazopanib 
arm (33%) versus 9% in the placebo arm. The most common events that led to dose interruptions 
were also transaminase liver enzyme elevations, diarrhea and hypertension. 
 
Post marketing experience 
No studies have been submitted. 
  Discussion on clinical safety 
Cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during use of pazopanib. The safety 
and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib have not been fully established in patients with pre-existing hepatic 
CHMP assessment report

impairment, therefore administration of pazopanib to patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring. In addition, in clinical studies 
with pazopanib, increase in serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were observed. In the 
majority of the cases, isolated increases in ALT and AST have been reported, without concomitant 
elevations of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin.  
Monitor serum liver tests should be performed before initiation of treatment with pazopanib and at 
least once every 4 weeks for the first 4 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated. In addition 
periodic monitoring should then continue after this time period. Patients with isolated transaminase 
elevations ≤ 8 X upper limit of normal (ULN) may be continued on pazopanib with weekly monitoring 
of liver function until transaminases return to Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with transaminases of 
> 8 X ULN should have pazopanib interrupted until they return to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential 
benefit for reinitiating pazopanib treatment is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then 
reintroduce pazopanib at a reduced dose and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks (see 
section 4.2). Following reintroduction of pazopanib, if transaminase elevations > 3 X ULN recur, then 
pazopanib should be discontinued. If transaminase elevations > 3 X ULN occur concurrently with 
bilirubin elevations > 2 X ULN, bilirubin fractionation should be performed. If direct (conjugated) 
bilirubin is > 35 % of total bilirubin, pazopanib should be discontinued. 
To address hepatic safety concerns a contraindication (section 4.3) and warnings (section 4.4) have 
been included in the SPC. 
Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating pazopanib. Patients should be monitored for 
hypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. Hypertension occurs 
early in the course of treatment (88 % occurring in first 18 weeks). In the case of persistent 
hypertension despite anti-hypertensive therapy, the pazopanib dose may be reduced. Temporary 
suspension is recommended in patients if hypertension is severe and persists despite anti-hypertensive 
therapy and pazopanib dose reduction. Pazopanib treatment may be resumed once hypertension is 
appropriately controlled. Warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have occurred. 
Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients 
taking antiarrythmics or other medicinal products that may prolong QT interval and those with relevant 
pre-existing cardiac disease. When using pazopanib, base line and periodic monitoring of 
electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, potassium) within 
normal range is recommended and appropriate warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack have been observed in clinical 
studies with pazopanib. Therefore, pazopanib should be used with caution in patients who are at 
increased risk for any of these events.  A treatment decision should be made based upon the 
assessment of individual patient’s benefit/risk. Warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
In clinical studies with pazopanib haemorrhagic events have been reported. Pazopanib is not 
recommended in patients who had a history of haemoptysis, cerebral, or clinically significant 
gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage in the past 6 months. Pazopanib should be used with caution in 
patients with significant risk of haemorrhage. Warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Events of GI perforation or fistula have also occurred in clinical studies with pazopanib. Pazopanib 
should therefore be used with caution in patients at risk for GI perforation or fistula. No formal studies 
on the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted however. Since Vascular Endothelial 
Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors may impair wound healing, treatment with pazopanib should be 
stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume pazopanib after surgery 
should be based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing. Pazopanib should be discontinued in 
patients with wound dehiscence. The safety and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in patients with 
moderate to severe heart failure has not been studied. Warnings addressing these risks have been 
included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypothyroidism have occurred.  Baseline laboratory 
measurement of thyroid function is recommended and patients with hypothyroidism should be treated 
as per standard medical practice prior to the start of pazopanib treatment. All patients should be 
observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on pazopanib treatment. Laboratory 
monitoring of thyroid function should be performed periodically and managed as per standard medical 
practice. In addition, proteinuria has been reported. Baseline and periodic urinanalysis during 
treatment is recommended and patients should be monitored for worsening proteinuria. Pazopanib 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010

should be discontinued if the patient develops Grade 4 proteinuria. Warnings for hypothyroidism and 
proteinuria have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  A detrimental 
effect on such activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of pazopanib. The clinical status of 
the patient and the adverse event profile of pazopanib should be borne in mind when considering the 
patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills. Patients should 
avoid driving or using machines if they feel dizzy, tired or weak as stated in section 4.7 of the SPC. 
Pazopanib should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients and a contraindication has been included in section 4.3 of the SPC. 
Warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SPC providing special warning on interactions. 
Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) should be avoided due to risk of increased exposure to pazopanib. In 
addition selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit 
CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP should be considered. Concomitant treatment with inducers of CYP3A4 should 
also be avoided due to risk of decreased exposure to pazopanib. Concomitant administration of 
pazopanib with uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) substrates (e.g. 
irinotecan) should be undertaken with caution since pazopanib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Finally, 
grapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with pazopanib. 
As stated in section 5.3 of the SPC, there are no adequate data from the use of pazopanib in pregnant 
women and the potential risk for humans is unknown. Pazopanib should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the clinical condition of the women requires treatment. If pazopanib is used during pregnancy, 
or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard to the foetus should 
be explained to the patient. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate 
contraception and avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with pazopanib. In addition, the 
safe use of pazopanib during lactation has not been established.  It is not known whether pazopanib is 
excreted in human milk and a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast feeding should be 
discontinued during treatment with pazopanib. 
In addition, the applicant will provide additional information on the safety of pazopanib as part of post-
authorisation commitments. Agreed follow up measures include: the final study report for study 
VEG113971 (an open-label study in cancer patients to evaluate the effects of ketoconazole and the 
effects of increased gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered pazopanib), the full 
protocol for post marketing hepatic monitoring (WEUKSTV4601) addressing the time period for accrual 
of pazopanib patients in PHARMO RLS and determining the comparability of data from this system with 
data collected outside the EU, and  the full protocol for post marketing monitoring of cardiovascular 
outcomes (WEUKSTV4602) including analysis of the potential increased risk that could be detected 
after 4 years of monitoring and whether, in addition to comparing incidence rates with other VEGF 
inhibitors, a comparison to those from pazopanib clinical trials would provide meaningful data.

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  There  are  no 
unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The preclinical safety profile of pazopanib was assessed in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. In repeat 
dose studies in rodents, effects in a variety of tissues (bone, teeth, nail beds, reproductive organs,

haematological tissues, kidney and pancreas) appear related to the pharmacology of VEGFR inhibition 
and/or disruption of VEGF signalling pathways with most effects occurring at plasma exposure levels 
below those observed in the clinic. Other observed effects include body weight loss, diarrhoea and/or 
morbidity that were either secondary to local gastrointestinal effects caused by high local mucosal 
medicinal product exposure (monkeys) or pharmacologic effects (rodents). Proliferative hepatic lesions 
(eosinophilic foci and adenoma) were seen in female mice at exposures 2.5 times human exposure 
based on AUC. 
Pazopanib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits at 
exposures more than 300-fold lower than the human exposure (based on AUC).  Effects included 
reduced female fertility, increased pre- and post-implantation loss, early resorptions, embryo lethality, 
decreased foetal body weight and cardiovascular malformation. Decreased corpora lutea, increased 
cysts and ovarian atrophy have also been noted in rodents. In a rat male fertility study, there was no 
effect on mating or fertility, but decreased testicular and epididymal weights were noted with 
reductions in sperm production rates, sperm motility, and epididymal and testicular sperm 
concentrations observed at exposures 0.3 times human exposure based on AUC. 
Pazopanib did not cause genetic damage when tested in genotoxicity assays (Ames assay, human 
peripheral lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and rat in vivo micronucleus). A synthetic 
intermediate in manufacture of pazopanib, which is also present in the final drug substance in low 
amounts, was not mutagenic in the Ames assay but genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay and in 
vivo mouse micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity studies with pazopanib have not been performed. 
Efficacy 
The efficacy of pazopanib in RCC was evaluated in a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled multi-centre study. A total of 435 patients with advanced RCC who had not received prior 
systemic treatment or who had only received prior cytokine treatment for advanced disease were 
randomized to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. There are no comprehensive data on 
the benefits in patients who have previously received systemic treatments other than with cytokines. 
The benefits of pazopanib were shown in terms of a statistically significant increased PFS as primary 
endpoint (median PFS 9.2 vs. 4.2 months, hazard ratio HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.62; p<0.0000001). 
In addition secondary endpoints showed an increased overall response rate of 30% in the pazopanib 
arm (95% CI, 25.1 to 35.6) vs. 3% in the placebo arm (95% CI, 0.5 to6.4) 95% CI; p <0.001) and a 
duration of response of 58.7 weeks in the pazopanib arm (95% CI, 52.1 to 68.1 weeks). The median 
time to response with pazopanib treatment was 11.9 weeks. The analysis of PFS and response was 
based on disease assessment by independent radiological review in the entire study population. 
From the total of 435 patients in this study, 233 patients were treatment naïve and 202 patients who 
had received one prior IL-2 or INF-based therapy. The median PFS in the treatment-naïve subgroup is 
slightly longer at 11.1 months compared to the median PFS for the cytokine-pretreated subgroup that 
is 7.4 months (hazard ratio for the naïve subgroup HR=0.4 95%CI (0.27,0.6) vs. hazard ratio for the 
cytokine-pretreated subgroup HR=0.4 95%CI (0.35,0.84). 
At the time of the analysis for the primary endpoint, the overall survival data were not sufficiently 
mature, however a trend has been shown in terms of improved overall survival in the pazopanib arm 
compared with the placebo arm (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00; 99.16% CI: 0.47, 1.12; p=0.020). 
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life using 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ-5D. 
Safety 
A  total  of  1645  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  pazopanib  in  clinical  trials,  including  16  monotherapy 
studies,  12  studies  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  3  studies  with  healthy  volunteers  and  special 
populations and 2 studies of psoriasis and macular degeneration. 
Pooled  data  from  586  subjects  the  pivotal  RCC  study  (VEG105192,  n=290),  extension  study 
(VEG107769,  n=71)  and  the  supportive  Phase  II  study  (VEG102616,  n=225)  was  evaluated  in  the 
overall  evaluation  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  pazopanib  (total  n=586)  in  subjects  with  RCC.  Overall, 
the median duration of exposure was approximately 7.4 months (including dose interruptions).

The most common adverse reactions of any grade included diarrhoea (49%), hair colour change (39), 
hypertension (38%), nausea (27%), fatigue (24%), anorexia (21%), vomiting (15%), dysgeusia 
(16%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (14% and 12% 
respectively) and abdominal pain (10%). Based on indirect comparisons, there are some events that 
appear to occur with a higher frequency for the approved agents (rash, mucositis, hand and foot 
syndrome (HFS)) while others occur with a higher frequency with pazopanib (high grade ALT 
elevations, all-grade hypertension and hair discoloration). 
The most important serious adverse reactions were transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, 
myocardial ischaemia, cardiac dysfunction, gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, QT prolongation and 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cerebral haemorrhage, all adverse reactions being reported in < 1 % 
of treated patients. 
Four fatal events that were considered possibly related to pazopanib included gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, abnormal hepatic function, intestinal perforation 
and ischemic stroke. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

Risk-benefit assessment 
Pazopanib  has  been  shown  to  be  an  effective  drug  for  patients  with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma, 
both  naïve  and  cytokine-pretreated.  The  difference  in  median  PFS  of  about  5  months  compared  to 
placebo was found statistically significant and it is considered clinically relevant. 
The  choice  of  placebo  as  comparator  in  the  pivotal  trial  was  an  initial  concern  supported  by  two 
centralised scientific advices (initial and clarification) given by the CHMP recommending the conduction 
of  a  study  with  an  active  comparator.  Although  cytokine-based  therapy  (IFN-α,  IL-2)  was  generally 
accepted  as  the  treatment  of  choice  at  the  time  this  trial  was  initiated,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that 
cytokine-based  therapy  was  not  considered  the  standard  of  care  in  many  countries  due  to  its  limited 
efficacy  and  excessive  toxicity.  At  the  time  of  submission  of  this  application  however,  several  new 
therapies  were  available  for  patients  with  advanced  RCC  (including  the  anti-VEGF  antibody 
bevacizumab,  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  such  as  sorafenib  and  sunitinib,  and  mTOR  inhibitors  such  as 
temsirolimus and everolimus). Therefore, the CHMP was of the opinion that even though in the specific 
case of pazopanib it has been shown that the product is effective, an active comparator with other TKI 
inhibitors  was  necessary  in  order  to  rule  out  that  the  use  of  pazopanib  would  mean  a  loss  of 
opportunity  for  the  patients.  Analysis  of  historical  data  including  a  qualitative  comparison  and 
discussion of biases has been provided by the applicant, however the data itself were not considered to 
provide conclusive evidence. 
The  safety  profile  of  pazopanib  was  overall  similar  to  other  marketed  TKIs  and  inhibitors  of 
angiogenesis and a consistent pattern was demonstrated across all RCC studies. Most of the toxicities 
are  manageable  including  diarrhoea,  hair  colour  change,  hypertension,  nausea,  fatigue,  anorexia, 
vomiting, dysgeusia, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase  and 
abdominal  pain  as  the  most  frequent,  but  serious  and  potentially  fatal  SAEs  can  occur  (transient 
ischaemic  attack,  ischaemic  stroke,  myocardial  ischaemia,  cardiac  dysfunction,  gastrointestinal 
perforation  and  fistula,  QT  prolongation  and  pulmonary,  gastrointestinal  and  cerebral  haemorrhage). 
Fatal events that were considered possibly related to pazopanib included gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
pulmonary  haemorrhage/haemoptysis,  abnormal  hepatic  function,  intestinal  perforation  and  ischemic 
stroke. In conclusion, no new safety concerns have been identified, however of particular importance is 
the fact that pazopanib inhibits the same targets as other TKIs with a different potency and selectivity 
leading to differences in the safety profiles.

As per CHMP request, an oncology Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting was convened on 8 
January 2010 to discuss the benefits/risks of pazopanib from a clinical perspective and whether it was 
possible to rule out with reasonable certainty that pazopanib could be associated with the risk of a 
clinically relevant loss in terms of efficacy or safety compared to currently approved agents in this 
indication. The SAG provided advice on the following questions raised by the Committee: 
1. Please discuss from a clinical perspective the benefit and risk of pazopanib in advanced RCC on the 
basis of the Rapporteurs’ reports and the data presented by the applicant (pivotal study VEG105192). 
The SAG unanimously agreed that from a clinical perspective the benefits particularly in terms of PFS 
as observed from the main results of the pivotal Phase III Study VEG105192 compared favorably 
against the toxicity, which was considered as generally manageable and overall acceptable compared 
to the benefits. 
It is important to note that the data presented refer to patients who have had no or only cytokine-
based treatment for advanced RCC. There are no comprehensive data on the benefits and risks of 
pazopanib in patients who have previously received systemic treatments other than with cytokines. In 
the absence of relevant data, no benefit-risk assessment for pazopanib can be made for patients 
pretreated with other systemic treatments (including TKI inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors or a combination 
of cytokines and anti-VEGF). 
2. Please discuss how appropriate choice of therapy can be made in clinical practice in the light of the 
current data about efficacy and safety of pazopanib and the currently approved agents. Is further 
information needed in order to make an appropriate choice of therapy? 
Currently, there are no direct comparative data to allow an accurate estimation of the differences 
between available treatments for first-line treatment of advanced RCC. In the absence of direct 
comparative data, indirect comparisons based in particular on the individual safety profiles can guide 
the clinical choice among different agents that have shown a high activity in this setting. Based on 
indirect comparisons, there are some events that occur with a higher frequency for the approved 
agents (rash, mucositis, HFS) while others occur with a higher frequency with pazopanib (high grade 
ALT elevations, all-grade hypertension and hair discoloration). There may be other factors such as 
route of administration and other preferences that will play a role.  
Although this should not be a prerequisite for approval, it is important that comparative studies are 
conducted, and that these are adequately powered to detect small differences (in either direction) in 
terms of efficacy, and that they allow a thorough exploration of any important differences in terms of 
toxicity. It should be assessed if the ongoing comparative study of pazopanib versus sunitinib fulfills 
these requirements. Although this was not extensively presented, a non-inferiority design and a delta 
of >2 months difference in median PFS may not be the ideal design to detect small treatment 
differences. The statistical considerations, including power, sample size and design of this study should 
be carefully assessed. 
3. Please discuss the relevance and acceptability of the applicant’s inter-trial comparison for the 
assessment of the benefit and risk of pazopanib in advanced RCC as compared to other TKIs. 
The inter-trial comparisons presented are relevant and useful to put the data into a clinical and 
historical perspective. However, it is impossible to draw any firm conclusions because the historical 
comparison includes studies with different populations, prognosis, etc. 
4. With the available information about pazopanib and the currently approved agents, is it possible to 
rule out with reasonable certainty a risk of clinically relevant loss in terms of efficacy or safety when 
using pazopanib in the claimed indication compared to currently approved agents in this indication? 
What is the strength of evidence for the conclusions? What would be the magnitude of such loss? 
The SAG agreed that a major loss in efficacy (e.g., several months of difference in median PFS or OS) 
or  safety  appears  unlikely  to  be  associated  to  pazopanib  compared  to  other  available  treatment 
options.  The  basis  of  evidence  for  this  assumption  is  the  clear  benefit  of  pazopanib  and  acceptable 
toxicity as observed in a well-conducted randomised controlled trial against placebo, as well as indirect 
comparisons and expert clinical judgement. However, the available data do not allow drawing any firm 
conclusions.  An  adequately  powered  study  should be  conducted  post-approval  to  formally assess  any 
differences  in  efficacy  and  allow  a  thorough  exploration  of  important  differences  in  toxicity  (see  also 
answer to Question 2). According to some members, the clinical documentation was not considered to 
be  comprehensive  in  the  absence  of  an  active-controlled  study,  and  argued  that  this  study  was 
considered essential to confirm the benefit-risk balance and should be conducted as part of a specific 
obligation in a conditional marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP considered the  data submitted by the applicant and the argumentation put forward by the 
applicant and the SAG experts. The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance for pazopanib was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010  
Page 74/76
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive. There is a need however to obtain further data of the efficacy and safety in the context of an 
adequate  active  comparator  to  allow  an  accurate  estimation  of  the  differences  between  available 
treatments.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  pivotal  trial  was  at  a  very  advanced  stage  at  the  time 
when  other  TKI  therapies  were  approved  and  that  the  trial  was  started  at  a  time  when  useful 
comparators were not available. Thus, the CHMP proposed a conditional marketing authorisation, after 
having  consulted  the  applicant.  The  CHMP  considered  that  pazopanib  is  an  orphan  medicinal  product 
which  aims  at  the  treatment  of  a  life-threatening  disease,  and  therefore  falls  within  the  scope  of 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006.  
In connection with the review of the orphan designation criteria by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) at its meeting of 7-8 April 2010, the Applicant requested the Commission to remove 
the product from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products on 7 April 2010. 
As  a  consequence,  the  CHMP  considered  at  its  April  CHMP  meeting  that  Votrient  still  falls  within  the 
scope  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006,  i.e.  under  Article  2(1)  –  medicinal  product  which  aims  at  the 
treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening 
diseases  and  issued  a  revised  opinion  recommending  the  granting  of  conditional  Marketing 
authorisation. 
In addition the CHMP considered that pazopanib fulfils the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) 
No 507/2006 based on the following grounds: 
a) Efficacy in terms of PFS prolongation has been demonstrated in a pivotal Phase III, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre study conducted in advanced renal cell carcinoma 
patients. Overall, a delay of the median time to progression of about 5 months was observed. A 
favourable effect of pazopanib was also observed in terms of secondary endpoints including overall 
response rate and duration of response. Treatment with pazopanib was associated with manageable 
toxicity including diarrhoea, hair colour change, hypertension, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, 
dysgeusia, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and abdominal 
pain. These concerns do not constitute blocking issues for an anti-cancer compound in this indication. 
Therefore, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
b)  There  is  a  need  to  gain  more  understanding  about  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  pazopanib  in  the 
context of other available medicinal products for the same indication. In this regard the applicant has 
already  initiated  a  non-inferiority  Phase  III  randomised,  controlled  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  pazopanib  versus  the  tyrosine  kinase  inhibibor  sunitinib.  The  applicant  has 
agreed to perform a pooled analysis of data from study VEG108844 and study VEG113078 (a study to 
evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  of  pazopanib  versus  sunitinib  for  the  treatment  of  Asian  subjects  with 
locally  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma  -  a  sub  study  of  VEG108844)  in  order  to 
provide  robust  clinical  data  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pazopanib  versus  sunitinib.  The 
studies  will  be  appropriately  powered  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  with  a  margin  of  1.22  and  a 
discussion  on  the  applicability  of  the  efficacy  data  from  VEG113078  to  the  European  population  will 
provided. Thus, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical 
data. 
c)  Despite  other  agents  that  have  shown  relevant  clinical  efficacy  in  this  setting,  such  as  different 
regimens  of  cytokines,  combination  treatment  with  interferon  alfa-2a  and  the  anti-VEGF  antibody 
bevacizumab,  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  such  as  sorafenib  and  sunitinib,  and  mTOR  inhibitors  such  as 
temsirolimus  and  everolimus,  there  remains  a  large  unmet  medical  need  in  the  treatment  of  this 
condition  because  the  disease  eventually  progresses  in  most  patients  and  available  treatments  are 
associated  with  clinically  important  adverse  drug  reactions.  Thus,  different  agents  through  different 
safety  and  efficacy  profiles  may  offer  major  therapeutic  advantages  to  those  affected  in  terms  of 
clinical  efficacy,  safety  or  other  aspects  such  as  patient  preference.  Pazopanib  has  been  associated 
with  high  tumour  response  rate  and  important  improvement  in  terms  of  PFS  in  treatment  naïve 
patients with advanced RCC and in patients with advanced RCC who were refractory to prior cytokine 
therapy  based  on  a  randomized  controlled  trial.  The  safety  profile  has  been  well-characterized  and  is 
considered  manageable.  Based  on  indirect  comparisons,  there  are  some  events  that  appear  to  occur 
with  a  higher  frequency  for  the  approved  agents  (rash,  mucositis,  HFS)  while  others  occur  with  a 
higher  frequency  with  pazopanib  (high  grade  ALT  elevations,  all-grade  hypertension  and  hair 
discoloration).  Furthermore,  compared  to  other  agents  that  have  shown  activity  in  advanced  RCC, 
pazopanib has a distinct pharmacodynamic profile in terms of potency in inhibiting the main receptor 
tyrosine  kinases  involved  in  angiogenesis.  The  different  pharmacodynamic  profile  may  explain  the 
potential  differences  observed  in  the  indirect  comparisons  presented,  although  this  would  have  to  be 
confirmed in adequately powered randomized controlled trials. The addition of a safe treatment option 
that is associated with clear clinical benefits and with a distinct pharmacodynamic profile is considered 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358537/2010  
Page 75/76
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to offer major advantage in the context of the therapies for this disease. Therefore the CHMP considers 
that unmet medical needs will be fulfilled for the treatment of advanced RCC.   
d) In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the immediate availability on the market outweighs the 
risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Votrient  is  not  similar  to  Nexavar  (sorafenib),  Torisel  (temsirolimus) 
and Afinitor (everolimus) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. 
See appendix 1. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by a majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Votrient in the first line treatment of advanced Renal Cell 
Carcinoma (RCC) and for patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Votrient not 
to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Nexavar 
(sorafenib), Torisel (temsirolimus) and Afinitor (everolimus) for the same therapeutic indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The upadacitinib Crohn's disease (CD) clinical development program was designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in moderately to severely active CD in adult subjects who have 
primary or secondary inadequate response or intolerance to any of the currently available treatments 
for CD, including biologic treatments (Bio-IR) and conventional treatments except biologics (Non-Bio-
IR). 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Crohn's disease (CD) is chronic inflammatory bowel disease with focal asymmetric, transmural, and 
occasionally granulomatous inflammation which can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract. CD may present with symptoms of fatigue, prolonged diarrhea with or without gross bleeding, 
abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever but the most common clinical symptoms are abdominal pain 
and diarrhoea. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
“RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a biologic agent, or for whom such therapies are not advisable.” 
Epidemiology  
Crohn disease is most common in western Europe and North America, where it has a prevalence of 100 
to 300 per 100,000 people. (NIH)  
Crohn's disease may present at any age though it more commonly presents in young adults. Both 
sexes are affected equally. It is more common in the presence of a family history in first degree 
relatives. 
Biologic features 
The exact cause of CD is still unknown but is hypothesized to be the result of a dysregulated immune 
system in the context of a genetically susceptible individual. It is thought that a combination of a 
patient's genetics, microbiome, immune response, and the environment result in an excessive and 
abnormal immune response in the gut that results in pathology seen in CD. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Any part of the GI tract may be affected from the mouth to the anus, with the ileum, colon and 
perineum most frequently involved. Affected tissue is identified by well-demarcated areas of thickened 
bowel, stenosis, adhesions, local lympho-adenopathy and fistulae. Typical endoscopic features include 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 8/217 
 
 
 
 
isolated aphthous ulcers, deep ulceration, a cobblestone appearance of the gut lining and polyp 
formation.  Histologically, Crohn's disease is characterised by trans-mural inflammation of the 
intestine. Inflammation may be non-specific or may be present as focal or diffuse granulomata. Extra-
intestinal manifestations may affect the skin, joints, liver, biliary tree and eyes.  
Diagnosis is achieved by a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, endoscopic and histological 
findings.  
The natural history of CD is progressive for several patients, ultimately requiring hospitalisation and 
surgery, and lifelong treatment is required. 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition that relapses and remits. It has a global impact on patients’ 
education, work, social and family life. 
Management 
The aim of medical treatment in CD has been focused on controlling inflammation and reducing 
symptoms. In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to heal the gut mucosa. 
Resolution of intestinal ulcers and endoscopic remission have been associated with positive clinical 
benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and few abdominal 
surgeries. However, improvement of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to 
achieve than symptomatic improvement alone. 
Treatment of moderately to severely active CD consists of conventional pharmaceutical therapies such 
as corticosteroids (for short term use) and immunomodulators [e.g., thiopurines and methotrexate], as 
well as biologic therapies. Contrary to the case in Ulcerative colitis (UC), aminosalicylates has shown 
limited efficacy in CD and is not recommended. 
The approval of the first biologic infliximab over two decades ago and a few years later adalimumab 
greatly improved the treatment possibilities in CD. More recently, vedolizumab an anti-integrin and 
ustekinumab an inhibitor of IL-12 and IL-23 has been approved for use in CD. 
Still, a proportion of CD patients have limited efficacy of approved treatments due to failing to respond 
(primary non-response), losing response over time (secondary non-response) or having contra-
indications or intolerance to these medications. Regarding anti-TNF agents, data from clinical trials 
demonstrate that approximately 40% of patients experience primary non-response and secondary loss 
of response has occurred in 38% of patients at 6 months and 50% of patients at 1 year. 
Therefore, there are unmet clinical need for new effective treatments in CD. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes 
that transmit cytokine or growth factor signals involved in a broad range of cellular processes including 
inflammatory responses, hematopoiesis, and immune surveillance. The JAK family of enzymes contains 
four members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 which work in pairs to phosphorylate and activate signal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). This phosphorylation, in turn, modulates gene 
expression and cellular function. JAK1 is important in inflammatory cytokine signals while JAK2 is 
important for red blood cell maturation and JAK3 signals play a role in immune surveillance and 
lymphocyte function. 
In human cellular assays, upadacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with 
functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2. Atopic dermatitis is driven 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 9/217 
 
 
 
 
by pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, TSLP, IL-31 and IFN-γ) that transduce 
signals via the JAK1 pathway. Inhibiting JAK1 with upadacitinib reduces the signaling of many 
mediators which drive the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis such as eczematous skin lesions 
and pruritus. Pro inflammatory cytokines (primarily IL 6, IL 7, IL 15 and IFNγ) transduce signals via 
the JAK1 pathway and are involved in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease. JAK1 inhibition 
with upadacitinib modulates the signalling of the JAK-dependent cytokines underlying the inflammatory 
burden and signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases. 
Upadacitinib is indicated in Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Axial spondyloarthritis, Atopic 
dermatitis and Ulcerative colitis. 
In 2022, a review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory disorders was initiated at the 
request of the European Commission (EC) under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. On 23 
January 2023, EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) endorsed the measures recommended by 
the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to minimise the risk of serious side effects 
with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders. These side 
effects include cardiovascular conditions, blood clots, cancer and serious infections. 
These medicines should be used in the following patients only if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available: those aged 65 years or above, those at increased risk of major cardiovascular problems 
(such as heart attack or stroke), those who smoke or have done so for a long time in the past and 
those at increased risk of cancer. 
JAK inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and 
in deep veins (venous thromboembolism, VTE) other than those listed above. Further, the doses 
should be reduced in patient groups who are at risk of VTE, cancer or major cardiovascular problems, 
where possible. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Upadacitinib Crohn’s Disease application is supported by data from one phase 2 dose ranging study, 
two replicate phase 3 induction studies (M14-431 and M14-433) and one phase 3 maintenance study 
(M14-430) which were all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre studies. As stated 
in the EMA Guideline (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 2 Guideline on the development of new medicinal 
products for the treatment of Crohn’s disease) “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, it 
is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided”. This is considered as fulfilled. The MAH 
also received Scientific Advice at the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3190/5/2017/II and clarification letter 
EMA/660515/2018). Most of the advice from the CHMP were followed with some minor deviation that 
are discussed in relevant sections. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, all clinical studies have been/are being conducted in accordance with the ICH 
and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and relevant regulatory requirements. Subjects were/are being 
accorded all rights granted by the Declaration of Helsinki. All protocols received approval by the 
appropriate governing investigational review board, ethics committee, or similar authority.  Standard 
research methodology was/is utilized for the conduct and performance of each clinical study.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided an ERA to include the new indication of Crohn´s disease; however, no new data 
for the environmental risk assessment were included with this application. The submitted ERA was 
updated from the original ERA submitted for the MAA for RA approval, and the updates to support the 
indications psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), atopic dermatitis (AD), active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-Radiographic Axial Spondylarthritis (nr-axSpA) in adult patients. 
In the original ERA the results of the Phase I assessment triggered a Phase II Tier A assessment and 
the standard suite of fate and effect studies were completed. 
Upadacitinib is very persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study. A Phase II Tier B 
extended effects on water sediment was thus triggered. 
Regarding the original ERA, the MAH submitted a final report an OECD TG107 study post-approval. The 
overall log Kow of the test substance was determined to be 1.81 (pH4), 2.50 (pH7), and 2.48 (pH9) at 
25°C. The conclusion of the assessment was that the study report provided had an acceptable 
experimental design and fulfilled the quality/validation criteria and that the data was also included in 
the updated ERA in a satisfactory manner. 
Phase I 
The maximum daily dose for the indication CD is 45 mg/day, resulting in PECSURFACEWATER value of 0.225 
µg/L, for each of the indications RA, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA with the maximum daily dose of 15 
mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.075 µg/L, for the indication AD with the maximum daily dose 
of 15 mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.15 µg/L and for the indication UC with the maximum 
daily dose of 45 mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.225 µg/L, when using the default Fpen value 
of 0.01. 
A PECSW-TOTAL was calculated (0.9 µg/L) and was used to re-calculate the Phase II Tier A and Tier B 
PEC/PNEC ratios.  
The Log Pow and Log D were 2.50 (pH 7) using the shake flask method (OECD 107). Since the values 
were below the criteria of 3 no PBT assessment was needed. 
Phase II 
For this application, the same PNEC values were presented as for the original ERA submitted for the 
MAA. In the table below the updated PEC/PNEC ratios are presented, based on the PEC value obtained 
for all seven indications. These ratios remain far below 0.1, and the conclusion remains: the clinical 
use of upadacitinib is not expected to be a risk for the environment. 
The PEC values in relevant environmental compartments are compared to the PNEC values for these 
compartments by calculation of PEC/PNEC ratios.

Conclusion 
Considering the above data, upadacitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No additional toxicology studies were conducted to support this application; however, the MAH has 
proposed changes in Section 5.3 of the SmPC to correct some of the figures. These proposals are 
acceptable to the CHMP. There are no objections from a non-clinical point of view concerning the 
application for Rinvoq (upadacitinib) to include a new indication; treatment of Crohn´s disease in 
adults. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of updacitinib.  
Considering the above data, upadacitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

moderately to severely active CD during the induction study, was comparable to dose-normalized 
exposures in subjects on extended-release formulation with UC, RA/AD in Phase 3 studies (Figure 1). 
The dose-normalized exposures in the maintenance study were comparable to the dose-normalized 
exposure in the induction studies.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The MAH conducted two separate analyses of the data supporting this application with the objective to 
describe the PK of upadacitinib in subjects with Chron’s disease. The data from studies M14-431 and 
M14-433 (induction period studies) were analysed separately (R&D/21/1457) from the results from 
study M14-430 (evaluation of efficacy and safety during the maintenance phase in subjects who were 
responders after 12 weeks of treatment in studies M14-431 and M14-433, R&D/21/1458).  
The model developed using data from the induction studies was used for the description of data from 
the maintenance studies using a post hoc approach. Model parameters were not re-estimated. 
Exposures generated using the population PK model were used in exposure-response modelling.  
All pharmacokinetic data from subjects enrolled in Studies M14-431, M14-433 and M14-430, who 
received at least one dose of upadacitinib and had at least one measurable upadacitinib concentration, 
were included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Samples were removed if 
dose/concentration was missing, if concentration was measured before first dose, if time since last 
dose (TSLD) was >140 hours (10 half-lives), timepoint was erroneous, if samples were BLQ or 
according to the outlier rule. In total 10.3% of the concentration data records from the induction study 
dataset and 19.6% of the concentration data records from the maintenance dose dataset were 
excluded. A total of 4.6% and 14.7% were removed due to the outlier rule from each study, 
respectively.  
Evaluation and qualification of models 
The upadacitinib population pharmacokinetic model was developed using non-linear mixed-effects 
modelling based on NONMEM (Version 7.4.4). A previously developed population pharmacokinetic 
model that described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and subjects with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), atopic dermatitis (AD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and CD (Phase 2 Study M13-740) served 
as the starting model for the analyses.  The pharmacokinetic dataset from this previous model was

extended to include data from the CD Phase 3 induction studies (Studies M14-431 and M14-433) and 
used for the current analyses. The CD population constituted 53% of the total number of patients in 
the dataset. The dataset included data from the following covariates were already included in the 
starting model (R&D/18/10791) and therefore not investigated:  CrCL, subject population (RA and 
healthy subjects), sex on CL/F and as well as sex and body weight on Vc/F. 
Additional covariates (including CD-specific covariates (baseline disease severity, disease duration, 
baseline fecal calprotectin, and CRP) were tested to improve the model fit via stepwise forward 
inclusion and backward elimination (as implemented in Perl Speaks NONMEM stepwise covariate 
modelling (SCM) routine (PsN Version 4.8.1)). None of the additional covariates tested showed any 
clinically meaningful impact on the PK of upadacitinib. Model evaluation was performed using 
goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks. The final parameter estimates are shown in Table 1, 
and the visual predictive check Figure 2.

plasma concentrations from Phase 3 Study M14-430 using a post hoc approach. Population parameter 
estimates of the fixed effects and estimates for the random effects (inter-individual variability) of the 
previously established population pharmacokinetic model were used to generate individual post hoc

Absorption 
Bioequivalence 
Study M21-561 was a Phase 1 single-dose, open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence, 
crossover study in 60 healthy subjects, aimed to assess the bioavailability of three upadacitinib 15 mg 
commercial formulation tablets (ER17) versus a single upadacitinib 45 mg commercial formulation 
tablet (ER19) under fasting conditions as well as after a high-fat/high-calorie meal.  
Study drug was administered in the morning on Day 1 of each period as follows: 
Blood samples for upadacitinib PK assay were collected up to 72 hours after dosing in each study 
period. A washout period of at least 4 days between doses were applied to ensure no drug carry-over. 
All available data were used in the statistical analyses; hence data of all subjects (N = 60) were 
included in the pharmacokinetic analyses, with the following exemptions: one subject did not receive 
regimen D in period 2 (due to adverse event), one subject did not receive regimen B in period 4 
(discontinuation upon subject´s own request) and one subject had upadacitinib plasma concentrations 
below LLOQ at all time points during Period 4 (Regimen D). Fifty-seven subjects completed all four 
periods of the study. 
The point estimates and corresponding 90% confidence intervals, obtained from the analyses of the 
natural logarithms of Cmax, AUC0-t, AUCinf, AUC0-12, and AUC12-72, are presented below. The results are 
all within the conventional acceptable range of 0.80-1.25.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes 
that transmit cytokine or growth factor signals involved in a broad range of cellular processes including 
inflammatory responses, hematopoiesis and immune surveillance. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The exposure-response analyses were exploratory. The objectives were to characterize the 
relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposures and efficacy and safety in subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD during the 12-week induction period and the 52-week maintenance 
period. This analysis is supportive to the available clinical data. Model-estimated steady-state 
upadacitinib average concentration (Cavg) was derived using empirical Bayesian estimates and used as 
the primary exposure metric for exposure-response analyses.  
Model-estimated steady-state Cmax was used to conduct supportive exposure-response analyses for 
safety. The exposure-safety analysis of the data from the induction studies was conducted using 
combined data from the Phase 3 induction studies in CD and UC (Study M14-324 and Study M14-675).  
For this analysis, the safety parameters were evaluated at the end of or during the induction period 
(Week 12 for CD and Week 8 for UC). 
Exploratory graphical analysis (quartile plots) of exposure-response was first conducted, followed by 
logistic regression of response endpoints with > 10 events. 
The study stratification variables were included as pre-specified variables in the efficacy exposure-
response models: Population (biologic therapy-intolerant or inadequate responder [Bio-IR] versus non-
Bio-IR), Baseline corticosteroid use (yes versus no), Endoscopic disease severity (SES-CD < 15, ≥ 15). 
Number of prior biologics (0, 1, > 1) was not included in the analyses as it was highly correlated with 
the population (Bio-IR versus non-Bio-IR) stratification factor. The following pre-specified relevant 
variables were included in the safety exposure-response models as recommended by the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 guidance: Hemoglobin (> 2 g/dL decrease from baseline, 
hemoglobin < 8 g/dL): baseline hemoglobin, Lymphopenia (Grade 3 or higher):  baseline lymphocyte 
count, Neutropenia (Grade 3 or higher): baseline neutrophil count, Serious infections, pneumonia, 
herpes zoster: age. 
The effect of significant covariates on exposure-response relationships was assessed and simulations 
using exposure-response models to generate the model-predicted efficacy of upadacitinib 45 mg QD 
compared to placebo were performed. Standard methods for model evaluation were used.  
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
The exposure-response analyses for efficacy from the induction studies did not show a trend for the 
percentage of subjects achieving clinical remission per CDAI with increasing upadacitinib Cavg within 
the range of plasma exposures associated with 45 mg QD.  Bio-IR status, clinical remission per PROs 
at Week 0, and endoscopic response at Week 0 had a statistically significant effect when tested on the 
intercept. None of the pre-specified covariates had a statistically significant interaction with the effect 
of upadacitinib exposure (slope of the effect).  
For clinical remission per patient reported outcomes (PROs), endoscopic response, and endoscopic 
remission, increasing upadacitinib Cavg was associated with increased percentage of subjects 
Assessment report

achieving these endpoints. SES-CD, age, and baseline fecal calprotectin had a statistically significant 
effect on upadacitinib exposure-response relationship for clinical remission per PROs.

CDAI, Clinical Remission per PROs, Endoscopic Response, and Endoscopic Remission During Induction

Exposure-safety analysis 
The relationships between upadacitinib Cavg and different safety endpoints or changes in laboratory 
parameters at or anytime through Week 12 were explored using data from the Phase 3 UC and CD 
patient induction studies. No trends were observed between upadacitinib Cavg and percentage of 
subjects experiencing pneumonia (anytime through Week 12), lymphopenia (Grade 3 or higher) at 
Week 12 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]), neutropenia (Grade 3 or higher) at Week 12 
(LOCF), herpes zoster (anytime through Week 12), serious infections (anytime through Week 12) or 
hemoglobin < 8 g/dL at Week 12 (LOCF). A statistically significant exposure-response relationship was 
observed for a > 2 g/dL in hemoglobin from baseline at Week 12 (Figure 4).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Absorption 
The design of study M21-561 is appropriate. Upadacitinib does not accumulate significantly, and it has 
been concluded in previous applications (see initial marketing authorisation application 
EMEA/H/C/004760/0000 for discussion) that no multiple dose BE-study is necessary. The shapes of the 
plasma concentration-time curves were further investigated by partial AUCs (AUC0-12 and AUC12-72), as 
recommended in the Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release 
dosage forms (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96 Corr1) when a multiple-dose study is waived. All primary PK 
parameters were within conventional acceptance criteria for establishing bioequivalence. The washout 
period is sufficient, given a terminal elimination half-life of 9-14 hours following administration of the 
ER formulation. In addition, no pre-dose plasma concentrations above 5% of the Cmax value for the 
subject in that period were detected. 
Upadacitinib plasma concentrations in one subject were below the LLOQ at all the time points for 
Regimen D (Period 4), and this subject was therefore excluded from the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analysis for Regimen D. The MAH has thoroughly investigated the root cause of the aberrant 
results, but neither the investigation of study source data (e.g. dispensing protocol, sample collection 
and storage records), nor the investigation of possible formulation deviations (e.g. via comparison 
across manufacturing process and release testing records from eleven batches of the 45 mg tablet, 
including the particular batch used in study M21-561) could explain the outlier observations of zero 
plasma concentrations observed in this subject.  
According to the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence exclusion of data could, in exceptional 
cases, be allowed for a subject with lack of any measurable concentrations or only very low plasma 
concentrations for reference medicinal product. In this study, regimen D represents the reference 
treatment with the already authorised, commercial formulation ER19 (upatacinib 45 mg). 
Consequently, the validity of the study should not be jeopardised by the exclusion of regimen D data 
for subject 308, and no concern is raised.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 21/217 
 
 
 
 
 
In a cross-over trial, subjects who do not provide evaluable data for both test and reference products 
should be excluded from the statistical evaluation, i.e. even if there is evaluable subject data for one of 
the regimens (test or reference), any data from the subject should be excluded from the statistical 
comparison of the regimens. Consequently, the MAH has adequately provided statistical analysis of the 
pharmacokinetic data, following the exclusion of subject 219 data in the comparison of regimen A vs. 
B, and following exclusion of data from subjects 118 and 308 in the comparison of regimen C vs. D.  
Plasma concentrations of upadacitinib were determined using an adequately validated liquid 
chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Satisfactory method performance 
during study sample analysis has been shown. 
The statistical analysis results from clinical study M21-561, satisfactorily demonstrate that the 
administration of three 15 mg upadacitinib tablets (ER17) is bioequivalent to administration of a single 
45 mg upadacitinib tablet (ER19) under fasting conditions as well as after a high-fat/high-calorie meal. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
For the population PK analysis, a total 20% of all concentration data were removed from the M14-430 
(maintenance study) dataset, of which 15% of data points were removed due to an outlier rule. This is 
not considered a good data handling practice and limits the use of the remaining data and undermines 
any conclusions made from analysis of this study. For this reason, only analyses based on the 
observations from the induction studies are described. In addition to the population PK analysis, the 
MAH conducted a graphical analysis where the dose-normalised concentration, without data point 
exclusion, from CD subjects were overlaid concentrations from UC, RA and AD subjects. This analysis 
indicates that the dose-normalised exposure is similar between the indications. As clinical data are 
robust with regards to efficacy, and safety is well established with 15 and 30 mg upadacitinib, the 
issues with the population PK analysis were not pursued by the CHMP. 
The MAH used population PK analysis to describe the PK of upadacitinib in CD patients. The model is 
also used to derive individual Cavg concentrations to be used in the exposure-response analysis. A 
previously developed model (using phase 2 data) was used. Parameters were re-estimated, including 
covariates found to be previously significant, and new covariates were tested (no consideration to 
correlation between covariates was given). The final parameter estimates were estimated with low 
RSE%. The shrinkage is high on all parameters except CL/F (15%). The condition number of the final 
model was 43.04. The model could adequately describe the exposure in the induction studies M14-431 
and M14-433 and is considered adequate to be used to derive Cavg for exposure-response analysis 
over the 12-week treatment.  
Subjects in the CD studies weighed 36-152 kg. Body weight on CL/F was the only new covariate 
included in the model; however, as both CrCL (for which body weight is part of the equation) and sex 
are correlated with body weight, and included in the model, it is not possible to draw a conclusion 
regarding the actual impact of body weight on CL/F. Correlated covariates should not have been tested 
and estimated simultaneously, a known relationship could be fixed in the model. Covariates should 
have been re-evaluated as more information became available. However, this issue was not further 
pursued by the CHMP. 
As 20% of observations respectively were excluded from the maintenance study, many due to an 
outlier rule, it cannot be assumed that there is not a bias in the model derived Cavg. Therefore, only 
the results from the 12-week induction study are described. As clinical data are robust with regards to 
efficacy, and safety is well established with 15 and 30 mg upadacitinib, the issue of exclusion of 
maintenance data will not be pursued.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 22/217 
 
 
 
 
As data from studies in UC and CD were combined and safety assessed at different time points (8 and 
12 weeks respectively) a conclusion of the relationship between exposure in CD patients given 45 mg 
over 12 weeks cannot be made for all safety endpoints.  
The exposure-response analysis of efficacy is limited as only 45 mg upadacitinib was given to CD 
patients in the induction studies. There is a small trend towards increased percentage of subjects 
achieving the efficacy endpoints (PROs, endoscopic response and remission) with increasing 
upadacitinib Cavg. The MAH pooled data from the Phase 2b/3 UC induction studies and phase 3 CD 
induction studies in the safety analysis. The only trend in safety data identified was relationship 
between Cavg and decrease in haemoglobin at week 12 (UC data not included as induction study 
ended at week 8). However, anaemia is a known AE for upadacitinib, and recommendations on 
management are already included in the SmPC. For further discussion, please refer to section 2.5.1. . 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Due to the study design and handling of data, the population PK and exposure-response analyses are 
limited. As clinical data are robust with regards to efficacy, and safety is well established with 15 and 
30 mg upadacitinib, the issues with the population PK analysis were not pursued by the CHMP. 
The analysis of data indicates that the exposure in Chron’s disease is similar to exposures observed in 
previously approved indications. The information in the SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
The clinical pharmacology data was considered acceptable to support the new indication in CD. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Upadacitinib Crohn’s Disease Clinical Development Program comprises a Phase 2 dose ranging study, a 
Phase 2 long-term extension (LTE) study, and three Phase 3 studies: two induction and one 
maintenance/LTE study. The Phase 2 dose-ranging Study M13-740 included a double-blind (DB) 
placebo-controlled 16-week induction treatment that assessed the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics versus placebo followed by a 36-week DB maintenance (extension) period 
(R&D/16/0677). Subjects who completed Study M13-740 were eligible to enrol in the ongoing LTE 
Study M14-327.

Study M13-740 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo- controlled study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib as induction therapy in 
subjects with moderately to severely active CD and evidence of mucosal inflammation and a history of

inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressants or anti-TNF therapy.  The study was 
designed to enroll approximately 210 subjects. 
The study duration was to be up to 60 weeks, including a Screening Period of up to 35 days, a 16-
week DB Induction Period, a 36-week Extension Phase that had both DB and open-label (OL) 
components, and a 30-day follow-up period. Subjects who met eligibility criteria were to be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the Induction Period dose groups: 
•  Upadacitinib 3 mg twice daily (BID) 
•  Upadacitinib 6 mg BID 
•  Upadacitinib 12 mg BID 
•  Upadacitinib 24 mg BID 
•  Upadacitinib 24 mg once daily (QD) 
• 
Placebo 
Subjects enrolled in this study were between 18 and 75 years old (inclusive) with a diagnosis of ileal, 
colonic, or ileocolonic CD for ≥ 3 months prior to baseline confirmed by endoscopy during the Screening 
Period. Eligible study subjects were to have had average daily liquid/very soft stool frequency (SF) ≥ 
2.5 or average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2.0, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and 
≤ 450 and Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with 
disease limited to the ileum) confirmed by a central reader. Subjects were to have inadequately 
responded to or experienced intolerance to previous treatment with immunosuppressants or an anti-
TNF agent (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab). The clinical measures that defined 
inadequate response were based on physician/investigator clinical assessment. 
A total of 220 subjects were randomized at 93 study sites located in 19 countries/regions (US, Canada, 
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). All 220 subjects received study drug, with a majority (180 
subjects, 81.8%) completing the 16-week DB Induction Period. 
Demographic characteristics were generally balanced across the upadacitinib dose groups and placebo 
group in the Induction Period. Greater than half (56.8%) of all subjects were female, and the majority 
of subjects were white, not Hispanic or Latino, and less than 65 years of age. The mean age of all 
subjects was 40.7 years. These demographic characteristics represent the population at large with CD. 
Greater than 90% of subjects across the upadacitinib groups and in the placebo group had previously 
failed or were intolerant to one or more prior anti-TNF therapies. Greater than 50% of subjects had 
received 2 or more prior anti-TNF treatments, with a higher number of subjects in the 12 mg BID and 
24 mg BID groups receiving more than 2 anti-TNF treatments. Overall, 43.2% of subjects across the 
upadacitinib groups also received prior non-anti-TNF biologic therapy. 
Co-Primary endpoints and definition: 
•  Clinical remission: Average daily very soft or liquid SF ≤ 1.5 and not worse than baseline AND 
average daily AP score≤1.0 and not worse than baseline. 
•  Endoscopic remission: SES-CD ≤4 and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline and no 
subscore > 1 in any individual variable. 
Results Study M13-740 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints, the proportion of mITT subjects who achieved clinical remission at 
Week 16 and endoscopic remission at Week 12/16, were compared between each of the upadacitinib

groups and placebo using NRI. At Week 12/16, a statistically significantly greater (P ≤ 0.1) proportion 
of subjects achieved the co-primary endpoint of endoscopic remission in all upadacitinib dose groups 
compared with the placebo group, with the exception of the 6 mg BID group. 
At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater (P ≤ 0.1) proportion of subjects achieved the co-primary 
endpoint of clinical remission in the 6 mg BID group compared with placebo.

Induction Dose Selection   
Dose selection was informed by the analysis of the 16-week safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and 
exposure-response data from Phase 2 CD Study M13-740, which evaluated 5 induction doses of 
upadacitinib using the immediate-release (IR) formulation (3, 6, 12, or 24 mg twice daily [BID] or 24 
mg QD) versus placebo. The results from Study M13-740 demonstrated the clinical and endoscopic 
efficacy of upadacitinib compared to placebo across several endpoints with doses of 6 mg BID and 
higher. Pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that the 12 mg BID and 24 mg BID doses of the IR 
Assessment report

formulation provided similar daily exposures to the 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD dose of the extended-
release (ER) formulation, respectively. Simulations based on the exposure-response analyses showed 
that doses higher than 45 mg QD (e.g., 60 mg QD) were predicted to provide minimal additional 
efficacy (2% to 5% increase), while a dose lower than 45 mg QD (e.g., 30 mg QD) predicted 5% to 
7% lower efficacy for the endoscopic endpoints compared to the 45 mg QD dose. Exposure-safety 
analyses demonstrated that there was no observed trend for a relationship between upadacitinib 
plasma exposures and decreases in hemoglobin (≥ 2g/dL), lymphopenia (Grade 2 or 3), herpes zoster, 
serious infections, and pneumonia during the 16 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the 45 mg QD dose 
was predicted to have maximized efficacy without increasing lab abnormalities or infections and 
therefore offer the optimal benefit-risk profile for an induction dose for Phase 3 in CD 
Maintenance Dose Selection 
Based on pathophysiology and data from other targeted immunomodulatory therapies, a lower dose 
for maintenance was expected to be effective once the initial high disease burden is reduced. 
Therefore, after induction treatment with 45 mg QD, 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses were chosen for 
maintenance treatment. 
Upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, using the ER formulation, provide equivalent daily area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and comparable maximum plasma concentration and 
trough (plasma) concentration measured at the end of a dosing interval (Ctrough) to the IR 
formulation of upadacitinib 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID, respectively. The upadacitinib 6 mg BID and 12 
mg BID doses used in the CD Phase 2 Study M13-740 showed statistically significantly higher 
endoscopic response at Week 12/16 compared to placebo. Following induction with upadacitinib 45 mg 
QD, lower doses of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD were therefore expected to maintain efficacy 
while minimizing dose dependent risks that may be observed with long-term use of higher doses.

Substudy 1 Cohort 1 (Study M14-430 Substudy 1 CSR Section 10.2). Out of the 1150 subjects 
randomized in the two global Phase 3 induction studies, 249 subjects did not achieve clinical response 
at the end of the induction period (Week 12) and were enrolled in the Extended Treatment Period. 
The two Phase 3 induction studies (Study M14-431 and Study M14-433) were multicenter studies 
conducted in adult subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 
months and moderately to severely active CD, with average daily very soft stool frequency (SF) score 
≥ 4 or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) ≥ 2.0, and a centrally-read SES-CD ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for 
subjects with isolated ileal disease), excluding the narrowing component.

Study participants 
Study M14-431 
Subjects with moderately to severely active CD (SF ≥ 4 and/or AP score ≥ 2) were enrolled, 
determined by evidence of active intestinal mucosal inflammation assessed by the Simplified 
Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD), confirmed by a central endoscopy reader; and the presence of very 
soft/liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain. Evidence of intestinal mucosa inflammation with an 
SES-CD of at least 6 in subjects with ileo-colonic or colonic disease or at least 4 in subjects with 
isolated ileal disease, excluding the narrowing component was also required to enroll in this study. 
Subjects should have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more biologic agents (Bio-
IR) for CD (adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and/or natalizumab). 
The study allowed for enrollment of up to 35% of subjects who were Bio-IR to 3 or more biologic 
agents. To be considered Bio-IR, subjects were required to meet criteria for types, doses, and 
durations of prior CD treatment as defined in the protocol.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion: 
Main Inclusion: 
1.  Confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 months prior to Baseline. Appropriate documentation of 
biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of CD, as determined by the investigator, must be 
available.

Treatments 
Induction 
Induction periods from Part 1 of both studies were DB, 12-week, placebo-controlled periods in which 
subjects were randomized 2:1 to upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo QD. To ensure enough 
clinical responders would be eligible for re-randomization into the Study M14-430 Substudy 1 
(maintenance period) while minimizing unnecessary exposure to placebo, a second 12-week open-
label, single-arm, induction treatment group was included in Study M14-431 (Part 2). Subjects who did 
not achieve clinical response at Week 12 in both induction studies continued into an Extended 
Treatment Period (Part 3 in Study M14-431 and Part 2 in Study M14-433) with upadacitinib 45 mg for 
subjects who were placebo non-responders and with upadacitinib 30 mg for subjects who were 
upadacitinib 45 mg non-responders. 
Subjects who were enrolled on oral steroids initiated a protocol-required taper at Week 4 to assess 
corticosteroid-free endpoints at Week 12.

Maintenance 
Substudy 1 (52-Week, re-randomized, DB, maintenance) included 3 cohorts (Figure 9). 
Cohort 1: Included subjects who received upadacitinib 45 mg induction treatment for 12 weeks in 
Study M14-431 (from Part 1 or Part 2) or Study M14-433 (Part 1), and subjects who received 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD induction treatment for 12 weeks during the Extended Treatment Period of 
Study M14-431 (Cohort 1 of Part 3) or Study M14-433 (Cohort 1 of Part 2) and achieved clinical 
response. Subjects were re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 3 treatment groups: 
•  Group 1: upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
•  Group 2: upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
•  Group 3: placebo 
Cohort 2: Included subjects who received DB placebo for 12 weeks during Part 1 of Study M14-431 or 
Study M14-433 and achieved clinical response and continued to receive blinded placebo. 
Cohort 3: Included subjects who entered the Extended Treatment Period of Study M14-431 or Study 
M14-433 and received DB upadacitinib 30 mg QD for 12 weeks and achieved clinical response at Week 
24 and continued to receive blinded upadacitinib 30 mg QD. 
During Substudy 1, at or after Week 4, subjects who met the criteria for inadequate response and 
required medical treatment were eligible to receive rescue treatment with OL upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
and protocol allowed CD-related medications (Figure 9). 
Note: Baseline was defined as the Baseline Visit of Study M14-431 or Study M14-433 (induction) and 
Week 0 is defined as the first study visit in Study M14-430 (maintenance).

Cohort 4: Included subjects who achieved clinical response in the OL Extended Treatment Period (Part 
3/Cohort 3 of Study M14-431) at Week 24 and continued to receive OL upadacitinib 30 mg QD for 240 
weeks. 
Cohort 5: All subjects who completed Substudy 1 were eligible to enroll in this cohort. At Week 0, all 
subjects continued to receive their originally assigned DB treatment (placebo, 15 or 30 mg QD 
upadacitinib). During Substudy 2, subjects who met the criteria for inadequate response may receive 
rescue treatment with upadacitinib 30 mg. 
*The three treatment arms in Cohort 5 remain blinded until the last subject completes Substudy 1. After all sites 
and subjects are unblinded, subjects receiving placebo only receive the concomitant CD-related medications, if any.

Efficacy Measurements 
The treatment targets for CD are to rapidly obtain a clinical response with induction treatment and 
then to maintain clinical response or remission, along with normalization of inflammatory markers (C-
reactive protein [CRP] and FCP) and endoscopic mucosal healing. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy Endpoint Definitions: (identical for induction studies M14-431 and M14-433 and maintenance 
study M14-430) 
•  Clinical remission per patient reported outcomes (PROs): average daily very soft or liquid SF ≤ 
2.8 AND average daily AP score ≤ 1.0 and both not greater than baseline 
•  Clinical remission per CDAI: CDAI < 150 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 38/217 
 
 
 
 
•  Enhanced Clinical Response: ≥ 60% decrease in average daily very soft of liquid SF and/or≥ 
35% decrease in average daily AP score and both not greater than baseline, or clinical 
remission 
•  Clinical response 100 (CR-100): Decrease of at least 100 points in CDAI from Baseline 
•  Clinical response: ≥ 30% decrease in average daily very soft or liquid SF and/or ≥ 30% 
decrease in average daily AP score and both not greater than baseline 
•  Endoscopic remission: SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least 2-point reduction from Baseline and no 
subscore > 1 in any individual variable, as scored by central reviewer 
•  Endoscopic response: decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline of the induction study (or for 
subjects with an SES-CD of 4 at Baseline, at least a 2-point reduction from Baseline), as 
scored by central reviewer 
CDAI Clinical Remission and Clinical Response 
The CDAI is a composite instrument that includes patient symptoms evaluated over 7 days (abdominal 
pain [AP], very soft or liquid SF, and general wellbeing), as well as physical and laboratory findings. 
Historically, CDAI has been the primary scoring system to measure clinical remission and clinical 
response, and CDAI clinical remission has been used as the primary endpoint for all previously 
approved biologics for moderately to severely active CD. Higher CDAI scores indicate more severe 
disease; CDAI clinical remission is defined as a total score < 150 and CDAI clinical response is defined 
as a drop in total score from Baseline of either in 70 (CR-70) or 100 points (CR-100).  
The upadacitinib Phase 3 trials measured clinical remission and clinical response using CDAI < 150 and 
CR-100, respectively. 
SF/APS Clinical Remission and Enhanced SF/APS Clinical Response 
Although the CDAI has been used historically, it has limitations. For these reasons, consideration has 
been given to replacing CDAI with a different PRO instrument. At the time of initiation of the 
upadacitinib Phase 2 program, there was not another prospectively evaluated and validated PRO 
instrument available for use in clinical trials of subjects with CD. Therefore, for the upadacitinib Phase 
3 program, the PRO instruments selected (SF and APS components of the CDAI) were based on clinical 
relevance to subjects with CD, a high concordance with the historic CDAI definitions of remission and 
response, responsiveness to change (Khanna 2015), and their initial prospective evaluation in the 
upadacitinib Phase 2 Study M13-740. 
The cut-offs for clinical response per SF/APS (≥ 30% decrease in average daily very soft or liquid SF 
and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily APS and both not worse than baseline), clinical remission per 
SF/APS (average daily very soft or liquid SF ≤ 2.8 and not worse than baseline and average daily APS 
≤ 1 and not worse than baseline) and enhanced SF/APS clinical response (≥ 60% decrease in average 
daily very soft or liquid SF and/or ≥ 35% decrease in average daily APS and both not worse than 
baseline, and/or clinical remission) were established based on analyses of historical adalimumab 
studies in CD and further validated in the upadacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 program. 
Based on internal calculations by the MAH, the SF/APS clinical response, clinical remission and 
enhanced SF/APS clinical response had a correlation with CR-70, over 90% with CDAI clinical remission 
and CR-100, respectively.

Corticosteroid-Free (or Steroid-Free) Clinical Remission 
During the upadacitinib Phase 3 induction studies, beginning at Week 4, all subjects taking 
corticosteroids for CD at Baseline were required to undergo a mandatory taper schedule as outlined in 
the protocols. Subjects who were on corticosteroids at Baseline, discontinued their use and achieved 
clinical remission (per CDAI and per SF/APS) at Week 12 were considered to be in steroid-free clinical 
remission.  
For the upadacitinib Phase 3 maintenance study, steroid-free clinical remission was defined in two 
ways: 
•  Subjects without corticosteroid use for CD at least 90 days prior to Week 52 and who achieved 
clinical remission (per CDAI and per SF/APS) at Week 52, among all subjects 
•  Subjects who discontinued corticosteroid use for CD at least 90 days prior to Week 52 and 
achievement of clinical remission (per CDAI and per SF/APS) at Week 52 among subjects 
taking corticosteroids for CD at Induction Baseline. 
Endoscopic Assessments 
The upadacitinib CD Phase 3 studies utilized the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) to measure 
improvements in mucosal inflammation, including endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, SES-CD 
0-2, and absence of ulcers by endoscopy/mucosal healing. SES-CD is calculated based on the sum of 
individual segment values for four endoscopic variables (presence and size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, 
affected surface and presence of narrowing). The five segments of the bowel evaluated on endoscopy 
for SES-CD were: ileum, right colon, transverse colon, sigmoid and left colon and rectum. Each 
variable in each segment is scored 0 to 3 resulting in SES-CD values ranging from 0 to 56 with higher 
scores indicating more severe disease. Endoscopic assessments were centrally read by blinded external 
expert physicians who were not study investigators. While the SES-CD is a validated scoring system, 
the thresholds to define endoscopic remission or endoscopic response have not been validated 
(Daperno 2004). Therefore, upadacitinib CD Phase 3 studies included the recommended endoscopic 
efficacy definitions (Abreu 2020) that both align with recent consensus and are associated with 
clinically meaningful endpoints (e.g., corticosteroid-free clinical remission), based on analyses of ROC 
curves and positive and negative likelihood ratios.  
Markers of Inflammation 
Hs-CRP and Fecal Calprotectin are markers of systemic and intestinal inflammation, respectively, used 
in routine clinical practice 
Quality of Life 
Fatigue 
One common and validated instrument to measure patient experience of fatigue is the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale, which assesses concepts 
related to the severity and impacts of fatigue over the past seven days, using 13 items rated on a five-
point scale ranging from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much"). The FACIT-Fatigue total score ranges from 
0 to 52, where a higher score represents less fatigue. AbbVie completed the validation of FACIT-
Fatigue in CD subjects and results demonstrate that the instrument has adequate psychometric 
properties to be an outcome measure and assesses the burden for subjects over time.  
IBDQ – Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire  
The 32-item questionnaire is divided into 4 domains: bowel symptoms (e.g., loose stools, AP), 
systemic symptoms (e.g., weight loss, altered sleep pattern), social function (e.g., work attendance, 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 40/217 
 
 
 
 
need to cancel social events), and emotional function (e.g., anger, depression, irritability). Each 
individual item has graded responses from 1 (poorest) to 7 (best). The total score ranges from 32 to 
224 with a higher score indicating better outcome. 
SF-36 
The SF-36 questionnaire assesses the general health-related QoL over 8 domains of a patient's 
functional health and well-being including physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general 
health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These domains are summarized 
into a physical component summary score and a mental component summary score with higher scores 
representing better outcomes. 
CD-Related Hospitalizations 
Quality of life is negatively impacted by CD-related hospitalizations, due to complications such as 
disease exacerbation, bowel obstruction, fistulizing disease, infections, need of surgical procedures, 
etc. In the upadacitinib Phase 3 clinical program, hospitalizations were categorized as CD-related, 
based on the investigator assessment of the hospitalization and documented in the case report form. 
These hospitalizations were defined as overnight hospital admissions or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization due to adverse event (AE) or complications that are related to CD including 
hospitalizations for surgical procedures related to CD or nonsurgical CD-related events, such as CD-
related flares or related to the complications of CD. 
Sample size 
Induction Studies M14-431 and M14-433 
For EU/EMA regulatory purposes M14-431: Assuming a rate of 12% for clinical remission per PROs in 
the placebo group and 29% in the upadacitinib group at Week 12, a total sample size of 495 subjects 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio (330 subjects in the upadacitinib group and 165 subjects in the placebo 
group) will be adequate to detect at least a 17% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at 
Week 12 between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at least 95% power at a 0.05 
two-sided significant level. 
Assuming an endoscopic response rate of 10% in the placebo group and 25% in the upadacitinib group 
at Week 12, this sample size will be adequate to detect at least a 15% treatment difference in 
endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at 
least 95% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level. 
The objective of Part 2 is to have a sufficient number of subjects with clinical response to be re-
randomized in the double-blind maintenance portion of Study M14-430. A total of 130 subjects 
enrolled in Part 2 would provide adequate number of subjects achieving clinical response to be re-
randomized to the maintenance portion of Study M14-430. 
For EU/EMA regulatory purposes M14-433: Assuming a clinical remission rate of 15% in the placebo 
group and 33% in the upadacitinib group at Week 12, a total sample size of 501 subjects randomized 
in a 2:1 ratio (334 subjects in the upadacitinib group and 167 subjects in the placebo group) will be 
adequate to detect at least a 18% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 12 between 
the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at least 95% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant 
level. 
Assuming an endoscopic response rate of 11.5% in the placebo group and 28.5% in the upadacitinib 
group at Week 12, this sample size will be adequate to detect at least a 17% treatment difference in 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023

endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at 
least 95% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level. 
A total of 495 and 526 subjects were randomized in Study M14-431 (Bio-IR population) and Study 
M14-433 (Non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR populations), respectively. These studies evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo as induction therapy for 12 weeks in subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD ( 
Figure 7). In Study M14-433, 45.4% of enrolled subjects were Bio-IR and 54.6% were Non-Bio-IR. 
Study M14-431, by design, only enrolled subjects with prior inadequate response and intolerance to 
biologics, with 60.8% of subjects having failed at least 2 biologics representing a patient population 
that is usually more refractory to existing treatments. 
Maintenance (Study M14-430 Substudy 1) 
For EU/EMA regulatory purposes: Assuming a Week 52 clinical remission (per PROs) rate of 42% for 
one of the upadacitinib dose groups and 17% for the placebo group, a total sample size of 501 
subjects randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (167 subjects each in upadacitinib 30 mg QD, upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD, placebo groups) will have approximately 99% power to detect at least a 25% treatment difference 
in clinical remission rates at Week 52 between the treatment groups and placebo using Fisher's exact 
test at a 0.025 two-sided significant level. 
Assuming an endoscopic response rate of 35% for one of the upadacitinib dose groups and 17% for 
the placebo group, this sample size will have approximately 94% power to detect at least a 18% 
treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 52 between the treatment groups and 
placebo using Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 two-sided significant level. 
To ensure at least 90% power for simultaneous achievement of these endpoints, this sample size of 
501 subjects (167 subjects each in upadacitinib 30 mg QD, upadacitinib 15 mg QD, placebo groups) is 
planned for the Primary Analysis in Cohort 1. 
The first 502 subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug in Study 
M14-430 Substudy 1 Cohort 1 were included in the ITT1 Population for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Among these subjects, 75.9% completed study treatment Overall, a similar proportion of subjects from 
the ITT1 Population completed study drug across the treatment arms.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
M14-431: A total of 495 subjects were randomized in Part 1 of the study in a 2:1 ratio to upadacitinib 
45 mg QD or matching placebo (330 subjects for upadacitinib 45 mg dose group and 165 for placebo 
group). Randomization was stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), endoscopic disease 
severity (SES-CD < 15 and ≥ 15), and number of prior biologic treatments (> 1 and ≤ 1). 
Subjects enroll into Part 3 from Part 2 of the study in an open-label manner. Subjects enrolling in Part 
3 from Part 1 are assigned either upadacitinib 45 mg QD or upadacitinib 30 mg QD depending on the 
randomized treatment received in Part 1 (placebo or upadacitinib 45 mg) in a blinded fashion. 
M14-433: Approximately 501 subjects were randomized in Part 1 in a 2:1 ratio into upadacitinib 45 mg 
group or matching placebo (334 subjects for upadacitinib 45 mg QD dose group and 167 subjects for 
placebo group). Randomization was stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), endoscopic 
disease severity (SES-CD < 15 and ≥ 15) and number of prior biologics with prior inadequate response 
or intolerance (0, 1, > 1). Subjects enrolling in Part 2 from Part 1 are assigned either upadacitinib 45

mg QD or upadacitinib 30 mg QD depending on the randomized treatment received in Part 1 (placebo 
or upadacitinib 45 mg) in a blinded fashion. 
M14-430: Approximately 427 subjects who received upadacitinib 45 mg QD induction treatment for 12 
weeks in Study M14-431 (from Part 1 or Part 2) or Study M14-433 (Part 1), and approximately 110 
subjects who received upadacitinib 45 mg QD induction treatment for 12 weeks during the Extended 
Treatment Period of Study M14-431 (Cohort 1 of Part 3) or Study M14-433 (Cohort 1 of Part 2) and 
achieve clinical response will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following three treatment 
groups: 
1.  Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg 
2.  Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg 
3.  Group 3: Placebo 
The randomization was stratified by prior induction study population (1) 
Study M14-433 non-bio-IR, 2) Study M14-433 bio-IR or Study M14-431 Part 1/Part 3, 3) Study M14-
431 Part 2), clinical remission per PROs status (yes or no), and endoscopic response status (yes or no; 
based on the local read) at Week 12 or 24 of Study M14-431 or Study M14-433. 
Subjects enrolling in Cohorts 2 and 3 of this study are assigned placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg QD, 
respectively, in a blinded fashion. Subjects enrolled into Cohort 4 in an open-label manner. Subjects 
enrolling into Cohort 5 are assigned placebo or upadacitinib 30 mg QD or upadacitinib 15 mg QD in a 
blinded fashion, according to the randomized treatment received in Substudy 1. 
Statistical methods 
Within each study, different sets of primary and key secondary endpoints were defined for US/FDA and 
EU/EMA regulatory purposes. 
Analysis populations 
Induction studies; M14-431 and M14-433 
The ITT populations (one for each study part) includes all subjects who received at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug during that study Part. For ITT1 population, subjects were included in the 
analysis according to the treatment groups that they were randomized to. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population represents a subset of the ITT1 population, consisting of subjects that 
did not have a major protocol deviation. Major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP 
population were identified prior to database lock. For PP population, subjects were included in the 
analysis according to the treatment groups that they were randomized to.

Missing Data 
Induction studies; M14-431 and M14-433 and Maintenance study; M14-430 
The primary approach for handling missing data in the analysis of binary endpoints were Non-
Responder Imputation (NRI) while incorporating Multiple Imputation (MI) to handle missing data due 
to COVID-19 (NRI-C). A sensitivity analysis for binary endpoints were NRI with No special data 
handling for missing due to COVID-19 (NRI-NC).  
For continuous efficacy endpoints where Mixed-Effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) analysis or 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) were performed, missing data were not explicitly imputed. 
In addition, As Observed (AO) and tipping point analysis were performed as supplementary and 
sensitivity analyses. 
Efficacy Analyses 
Induction studies; M14-431 and M14-433 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed based on ITT1 for Part 1. No statistical 
comparisons were performed for Part 2 and Part 3. The Primary Analysis were performed after all 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 45/217 
 
 
 
 
enrolled subjects had completed Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3, and the database had been locked. This 
were the only and final efficacy analysis. 
The co-primary endpoints were analyzed between upadacitinib group and placebo group at Week 12 
using the CMH test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors (baseline steroid use [Yes, 
No], endoscopic disease severity [SES-CD < 15, ≥ 15] and number of prior biologics [0, 1, > 1] based 
on Intent-to-Treat population in Part 1 [ITT1]). The non-responder imputation while incorporating 
Multiple Imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-C) was the primary approach 
for missing data handling in the analyses of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The NRI-C categorized 
any subjects who did not have an evaluation during a pre-specified visit window (either due to missing 
assessment or due to early withdrawal from the study) as a non-responder for the visit. The only 
exception was that subjects with missing data due to COVID-19 infection or logistical restriction were 
handled by MI and the subjects were characterized as responders or non-responders based on MI 
imputed values. In addition, at and after the CD-related corticosteroids intercurrent event and on/after 
the date of initiation of CD-related confounding medications after premature discontinuation of study 
drug, subjects were considered as non-responders. 
Continuous variables collected longitudinally were analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated 
Measurement (MMRM) model. Continuous efficacy variables which were collected at only one post-
baseline visit (such as SES-CD) were analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Point 
estimates and 95% CIs of mean change from baseline within each treatment group, and the difference 
between upadacitinib group and placebo group were provided. 
Maintenance study; M14-430 
The primary and final analysis for the 52-week efficacy analyses included subjects who have either 
completed Substudy 1 or have been enrolled at least 52 weeks prior but have prematurely withdrawn 
from Substudy 1, and safety analyses of all subjects enrolled in Substudy 1 with the data cut-off as of 
30 March 2022. 
The co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed based on ITT1 for Cohort 1. No 
statistical comparisons were performed for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3. For all efficacy endpoints, the 
descriptive statistics were provided for each cohort, and by treatment group for Cohort 1.  Unless 
otherwise specified, any subject who was randomized based on a wrong stratum was analyzed 
according to the actual stratum the subject belonged to.  For categorical variables, frequencies, and 
percentages were reported for each cohort and by treatment group for Cohort 1.  Within the ITT1 
population, pairwise comparison between each upadacitinib group and placebo group was performed 
using the CMH test adjusting for stratification factors.  For continuous variables, the model based 
mean and standard error was provided; pairwise comparison between each upadacitinib group and 
placebo group was performed using MMRM. 
Type-I Error Control 
The overall type I error rate of the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints were strongly 
controlled at two-sided 0.05 level of significance using a fixed sequence multiple-testing procedure as 
well as Holm procedure as described below. Analyses of other efficacy endpoints were performed at 
significance level alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) without multiplicity adjustment.

A total of 502 subjects were randomized in Cohort 1 on or prior to 29 Mar 2021 and were included in 
the ITT1 analysis set. 
Among subjects in the ITT1 population, a similar percentage of subjects in the placebo group (10.9%), 
upadacitinib 15 mg (13.6%), and upadacitinib 30 mg (11.9%) discontinued the blinded study drug 
prematurely; the primary reason for study drug discontinuation in upadacitinib groups was adverse 
event (AE), and lack of efficacy in the placebo group (Table 11). 
In addition, a higher proportion of subjects from the placebo group received rescue treatment of open-
label upadacitinib 30 mg, compared to the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 1,021 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of blinded study drug in the 
induction studies. Approximately 90% of subjects completed the induction period; the most common 
reason for discontinuation of treatment was AE for subjects on upadacitinib and withdrew consent or 
lack of efficacy for subjects on placebo. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Induction study M14-431 
The study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for upadacitinib 
45 mg compared to placebo for both the US/FDA and EU/EMA regulatory purposes. At Week 12, a 
statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.0001) proportion of subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group achieved the co-primary endpoint of clinical remission (defined by CDAI for the US/FDA and by 
PROs in the EU/EMA) compared to placebo group. At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (p-
value < 0.0001) proportion of subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group achieved endoscopic response, 
for both US/FDA and EU/EMA regulatory purposes, compared to the placebo group. 
Consistency of results across key sub-groups were demonstrated for the co-primary endpoints of 
clinical remission per CDAI and PROs respectively, and endoscopic response. The majority of the 95% 
confidence intervals for the treatment difference between upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in 
each subgroup excluded zero in favour of the upadacitinib 45 mg dose group.

Study M14-431 (NRI-C, ITT1) 
The key secondary endpoints (i.e., endpoints under the overall type I error control) for the US/FDA 
and EU/EMA regulatory purposes are summarized in Table 23 and Table 24, respectively. Overall, 
upadacitinib 45 mg has clear treatment effect over placebo for resolution of clinical symptoms, 
improvements in quality of life (QoL), and reduction in mucosal inflammation as measured by 
endoscopy. A majority of endpoints were statistically significant for upadacitinib 45 mg versus placebo 
for both US/FDA and EU/EMA regulatory purposes. 
Clinical response 100 (CR-100) (defined as decrease of at least 100 points in CDAI from Baseline) was 
achieved as early as Week 2, with statistically significant differences observed for upadacitinib 45 mg 
QD versus placebo. Additionally, clinical remission per CDAI was achieved as early as Week 4, with 
statistically significant differences observed for upadacitinib 45 mg QD versus placebo. The treatment 
effect increased over time, with greater treatment differences between upadacitinib 45 mg QD and 
placebo observed at Week 12. Moreover, endoscopic remission and steroid-free clinical remission were 
also achieved at Week 12, with statistically significant differences observed for upadacitinib 45 mg QD 
versus placebo. Patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL (by Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ]) and fatigue (by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue) also showed overall statistically significantly higher improvement in 
upadacitinib 45 mg versus placebo. CD-related hospitalizations were numerically lower in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group versus placebo. Additionally, while the total number of subjects analyzed 
was small, there was a trend for reduction in extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) for subjects who 
received upadacitinib 45 mg versus placebo.

subjects receiving DB upadacitinib in Part 1. Improvements in endoscopic, QoL, FCP and hs-CRP 
measures with OL upadacitinib were similar to the group of subjects receiving DB upadacitinib in

Maintenance study M14-430 
Study Design and Subject Population 
Study M14-430 is a Phase 3, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of maintenance and 
long-term treatment with upadacitinib in adult subjects with moderately to severely active CD who 
have achieved clinical response and completed the induction Studies M14-431 or M14-433. The study 
population includes subjects who have had an inadequate response or have been intolerant to at least 
one biologic (Bio-IR) and subjects who have had an inadequate response or have been intolerant to 
conventional therapies but no biologics (Non-Bio-IR). 
At Week 0, all eligible subjects were to enroll in Substudy 1 to receive study drug in a blinded fashion 
in one of 3 cohorts.  
Cohort 1: Subjects who received the 12-week induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg (including 
those who did not achieve clinical response with placebo and then received upadacitinib 45 mg for 12 
weeks) and achieved clinical response in Studies M14-431 or M14-433 were re-randomized to either 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD, upadacitinib 15 mg QD, or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The 
randomization was stratified by Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR status in the induction studies, as well as the 
clinical remission (per PROs) and endoscopic response status at the entry of Study M14-430 Substudy 
1. According to the protocol, all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were to be analyzed among 
the ITT1 population, planned to include the first approximately 501 subjects who were randomized and 
received at least one dose of study drug. The actual number of subjects included in the ITT1 
population is 502, since the last 2 subjects were randomized on the same date of 29 March 2021. 
Cohort 2: Subjects who received the 12-week induction treatment with placebo and achieved clinical 
response in Studies M14-431 or M14-433 continued to receive placebo. Cohort 3: Subjects who did not 
achieve clinical response after the 12-week induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg, received the 
12-week extended treatment with upadacitinib 30 mg and achieved clinical response in Studies M14-
431 or M14-433, continued to receive upadacitinib 30 mg QD. Baseline is defined as the Baseline Visit 
of Study M14-431 or Study M14-433 (induction study) and Week 0 is defined as the first study visit in 
Study M14-430 (maintenance study).

Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups in the ITT1 population. In 
the ITT1 population approximately 75% of subjects failed 1 or more biologics with 35.0% of subjects 
failed ≥ 3 biologics among the Bio-IR study population. A total of 95.0% of Bio-IR subjects had prior 
failure to at least 1 anti-TNF agent. The most common CD location per SES-CD was ileal-colonic at 
47.2%. Overall, 37.3% and 5.0% of subjects were on concomitant corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressants at baseline, respectively. Mean Crohn's disease duration was approximately 10 
years with a median value of 7.4606 years. The most commonly (>10%) reported medical conditions 
in subjects' medical history in the ITT1 population were anemia (26.7%), anal fistula (23.1%); 
arthralgia (20.5%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (15.5%), hypertension (12.2%), haemorrhoids 
(12.2%), depression (11.4%), abdominal pain (11.2%), anxiety (11.2%), drug hypersensitivity 
(11.0%), seasonal allergy (10.8%), and headache (10.4%) (Table 31). The Baseline characteristics 
of subjects in Cohort 2 (ITT2) and Cohort 3 (ITT3) were generally consistent with moderate to severe 
active CD. More subjects in the ITT2 population were Non-Bio-IR or had failed 1 biologic compared to 
the other cohorts. Subjects in the ITT3 population had longer disease duration, had a high proportion 
of subjects with prior failure to 3 or more biologics and more frequently had failed ustekinumab, had 
isolated ileal disease or extra-intestinal manifestations. At Week 0, more than half of subjects in the 
ITT1 population were in clinical remission, 75.1% achieved CR-100 response and 46.4% achieved 
endoscopic response

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints Study M14-430  
The co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for both upadacitinib 15 mg 
and upadacitinib 30 mg compared to placebo were met for both the US/FDA and EU/EMA regulatory 
purposes. At Week 52, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.0001) proportion of subjects in 
both the upadacitinib 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg groups achieved the co-primary endpoint of 
clinical remission (by CDAI for the US/FDA and by PROs in the EU/EMA) compared to placebo group. At 
Week 52, a statistically significantly greater (p-value < 0.0001) proportion of subjects in both the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg groups achieved endoscopic response, (for both US/FDA 
and EU/EMA), compared to the placebo group.

Secondary Efficacy Variables Study M14-430 
The key secondary endpoints (i.e., endpoints under the overall type I error control) shows that, 
upadacitinib 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg have are more effective compared to placebo for resolution 
of clinical symptoms, reduction in mucosal inflammation as measured by endoscopy and improvements 
in quality of life (QoL). A majority of endpoints were statistically significant for both upadacitinib 15 mg 
versus placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg versus placebo for both US/FDA and EU/EMA regulatory 
purposes.  
Clinical response 100 (CR-100) (defined as decrease of at least 100 points in CDAI from Baseline) was 
achieved at Week 52, with statistically significant differences observed for upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
versus placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg QD versus placebo. Among subjects who had achieved clinical 
remission at Week 0, a significantly higher proportions of subjects maintained clinical remission at 
Week 52 in the upadacitinib 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg groups, compared to placebo. Statistically 
significantly higher improvement in fatigue (defined as change from Baseline in Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue score) at Week 52 was achieved with upadacitinib 30 mg 
versus placebo while numerically higher improvement was noted for upadacitinib 15 mg versus 
placebo. Moreover, steroid-free clinical remission, irrespective of steroid use at Baseline, endoscopic 
remission and deep remission (defined as clinical remission and endoscopic remission) were also 
achieved at Week 52, with statistically significant differences observed for upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
versus placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg QD versus placebo.  
Patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL (by Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Questionnaire [IBDQ]) also showed overall statistically significantly higher improvement in upadacitinib 
15 mg versus placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg versus placebo at Week 52 (Table 34 and Table 35). 
CD-related hospitalizations were numerically lower in the upadacitinib 15 mg group versus placebo and

upadacitinib 30 mg versus placebo. Additionally, while the total number of subjects analyzed was 
small, a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects had resolution of their extra-intestinal 
manifestations (EIMs) in the upadacitinib 30 mg group versus placebo at Week 52, and a numerically 
higher proportion of subjects resolved their EIMs in the upadacitinib 15 mg group versus placebo.

Other Efficacy Variables Study M14-430 
Overall, these endpoints offer supportive data to the co-primary and key secondary endpoints under 
the overall Type I error control. Symptom improvement was shown by achievement of clinical 
remission [per CDAI or PROs], mean change from Baseline in CDAI, abdominal pain score (APS), or 
stool frequency (SF), achievement of CR-100, enhanced clinical response, and mean change from 
Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue.

Further, absence of ulcers (SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore of 0 among subjects with ulcers at 
Baseline), endoscopic remission and steroid-free were also observed at Week 52 with upadacitinib 15 
mg and 30 mg groups compared with placebo.  
Additionally, decreases in the biomarkers of fecal calprotectin (FCP) and high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hs-CRP) were sustained through Week 52 for upadacitinib versus placebo. Finally, QoL 
improvement, shown by improvements in IBDQ, WPAI-CD, EQ-5D-5L, SF-36, and Crohn's Symptom 
Severity (CSS) scores were observed over time for upadacitinib versus placebo. 
Cohort 2 (placebo) and Cohort 3 (Upadacitinib 30 mg) Efficacy 
At Week 52, 22.7% and 41.2% of subjects in Cohort 2 (placebo) and Cohort 3 (upadacitinib 30 mg), 
respectively, were in clinical response per PROs. 
Study M14-430 Substudy 1 (Maintenance) 
The following paragraphs have been submitted by the MAH. In Study M14-430 Substudy 1 Cohort 1, 
results demonstrated that in subjects who achieved SF/APS clinical response after 12-week induction 
treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg, both upadacitinib maintenance doses of 15 mg and 30 mg were 
effective in reaching long-term treatment targets. Higher proportions of subjects treated with 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (per CDAI and 
per SF/APS) and endoscopic response at Week 52 compared with placebo. A significantly greater 
proportion of subjects treated with upadacitinib maintained clinical remission at Week 52 compared 
with placebo. Steroid-free clinical remission was achieved irrespective of steroid use at Baseline of 
induction. Improvement in fatigue and resolution of EIMs were achieved with upadacitinib 30 mg 
compared to placebo. The results of objective assessments, including endoscopic endpoints and 
inflammatory markers (FCP, hs-CRP), underscore the importance of continuing upadacitinib as 
maintenance therapy. The improvements in QoL were maintained through 52 weeks of maintenance 
treatment. Stringent treatment goals were also achieved, including deep remission, absence of ulcers 
by endoscopy (US)/mucosal healing (EU), and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) 
0-2. Overall, there was a clear dose-response, with higher efficacy observed in the upadacitinib 30 mg 
dose group than in the 15 mg dose group. 
Among subgroups, the clinical remission and endoscopic response results were consistent with the 
overall results. A greater treatment effect for the upadacitinib 30 mg dose relative to the 15 mg dose 
was observed in subgroups of subjects with more severe and high disease burden (i.e., CDAI > 300 at 
Baseline, those who presented with elevated FCP and hs-CRP, and with prior biologic failure). 
Summary of main study(ies) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Summary of Efficacy for Study M14-431 
Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease Who Have Inadequately 
Responded to or are Intolerant to Biologic Therapy 
Study identifier 
M14-431 
The study consists of a Screening Period (approximately 5 weeks), a 12-Week Induction Period, a 
12-Week Extended Treatment Period, and a 30-day follow-up for subjects who do not enroll into 
Study M14-430. 
Induction Period is a 12-week period consisting of 2 parts: 
•  Part 1:  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Induction Period, eligible 
subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) or 
matching placebo for 12 weeks. 
•  Part 2:  an open-label, single-arm active Induction Period.  After enrollment in Part 1 was 
complete, additional subjects were enrolled in Part 2 to receive upadacitinib 45 mg QD 
for 12 weeks. 
Design 
Extended Treatment Period is a 12-week period for subjects who do not achieve clinical 
response at Week 12 of the Induction Period which consists of 3 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1:  Subjects who received placebo in Part 1 were eligible to receive double-blind 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 12 weeks (until Week 24). 
•  Cohort 2:  Subjects who received upadacitinib in Part 1 were eligible to receive double-
blind upadacitinib 30 mg QD for 12 weeks (until Week 24). 
•  Cohort 3:  Subjects who received upadacitinib in Part 2 were eligible to receive open-
label upadacitinib 30 mg QD for 12 weeks (until Week 24).

Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease Who Have Inadequately 
Responded to or are Intolerant to Conventional and/or Biologic Therapies 
Study identifier 
M14-433 
The study consists of a Screening Period (approximately 5 weeks), a 12-Week Induction Period, a 
12-Week Extended Treatment Period, and a 30-day follow-up for subjects who do not enroll into 
Study M14-430. 
Induction Period (Part1) is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period.  
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) or 
matching placebo for 12 weeks. 
Extended Treatment Period (Part2) is a 12-week period for subjects who do not achieve clinical 
response at Week 12 of the Induction Period which consists of 2 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1: Subjects who received placebo during Part 1 and did not achieve clinical 
response at Week 12 were eligible to receive double-blind induction treatment with 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 12 weeks (until Week 24). 
•  Cohort 2: Subjects who received upadacitinib during Part 1 and did not achieve clinical 
response at Week 12 were eligible to receive double-blind upadacitinib 30 mg QD for 12 
weeks (until Week 24).

The study consists of two sub-studies: Substudy 1 is the 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled maintenance study.  Substudy 2 is the 240-week long-term extension study. 
Substudy 1 (Maintenance Study) consists of 3 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1:  Subjects who received the 12-week induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg 
(including those who did not achieve clinical response with placebo and then received upadacitinib 
45 mg for 12 weeks) and achieved clinical response in Studies M14-431 or M14-433 were re-
randomized to either upadacitinib 30 mg QD, upadacitinib 15 mg QD, or matching placebo in a 
1:1:1 ratio. 
Design 
•  Cohort 2:  Subjects who received the 12-week induction treatment with placebo and achieved 
clinical response in Studies M14-431 or M14-433 continued to receive placebo. 
•  Cohort 3:  Subjects who did not achieve clinical response after the 12-week induction treatment 
with upadacitinib 45 mg, received the 12-week extended treatment with upadacitinib 30 mg and 
achieved clinical response in Studies M14-431 or M14-433, continued to receive upadacitinib 30 
mg QD.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The results of the integrated analysis for induction are consistent with the results of the individual 
studies at Week 12. Please see tables below. Improvements with upadacitinib 45 mg treatment were 
shown in multiple measures of disease activity and symptoms when compared with placebo. Please see 
below for the integrated analyses sets.  Chosen data are presented in this section.

A total of 495 and 526 subjects were randomized in Study M14-431 (Bio-IR population) and Study 
M14-433 (Non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR populations), respectively, the two confirmatory Phase 3 induction 
studies. These studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo as 
induction therapy for 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active CD ( 
Figure 7).  
In Study M14-433, 45.4% of enrolled subjects were Bio-IR and 54.6% were Non-Bio-IR. Study M14-
431, by design, only enrolled subjects with prior inadequate response and intolerance to biologics, with 
60.8% of subjects having failed at least 2 biologics.

The primary efficacy analysis for these studies was the ITT1 population as presented under each study 
above. Twelve weeks of treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg QD was superior to placebo as an induction 
therapy across the co-primary efficacy endpoints for both induction studies (p-values < 0.0001); 
statistically significantly higher proportions of subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg groups achieved the 
co-primary endpoints of clinical remission (defined by CDAI for the US/FDA and by SF/APS in the 
EU/EMA). 
A majority of key secondary endpoints were also achieved, reduction in mucosal inflammation, and 
improvements in QoL with IBDQ, under the overall Type I error control.

Results of Subjects Enrolled in the Extended Treatment Period 
Overall, 122 subjects who did not achieve clinical response to upadacitinib 45 mg QD at Week 12 
received upadacitinib 30 mg for an additional 12 weeks. Integrated data from the 2 induction studies 
showed that 52.7% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 45/30 mg achieved SF/APS clinical response at 
Week 24. In addition, 29.8% and 24.7% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 45/30 mg achieved clinical 
remission per CDAI and per SF/APS, respectively, at Week 24, and 13.2% of subjects achieved 
endoscopic response at Week 24 (Table 45). 
Among subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 24, enrolled in Cohort 3 of Study M14-430, 
and were included in this analysis as of the 30 March 2022 data cut-off, the efficacy results were 
generally maintained after 52 weeks of maintenance treatment

A total of 450 subjects who achieved clinical response after 12-week treatment with upadacitinib 45 
mg and were re-randomized to and received 15 mg or 30 mg were included in the analyses (ISE3 
population) with a follow up to 196 weeks as of the data cut-off. The number of subjects tends to 
decrease over time and is low beyond Week 100 as Study M14-430 is ongoing and most subjects have 
not yet reached the later visits as of the data cut-off. 
The results of the integrated analysis support consistent, sustained improvements in disease activity 
and symptoms during treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg as maintenance/long-term therapy, 
with results maintained from Week 52 through Week 100.

The results support consistent, sustained improvement in disease activity and symptoms (clinical

and improvements in QoL during treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg as maintenance/long-
term therapy, with results maintained from Week 52 through Week 100. Greater efficacy was noted 
with upadacitinib 30 mg compared with 15 mg, overall, across all endpoints. 
Among subjects who experienced inadequate response and received open-label (OL) upadacitinib 30 
mg as rescue therapy, percentages of subjects achieving CR-100 and clinical remission increased from 
12 to 24 weeks after receiving the rescue therapy for those initially on placebo and upadacitinib 15 
mg. Additionally, subjects who received rescue treatment had improvement in the markers of 
inflammation hs-CRP and FCP. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Rinvoq (Upadacitinib) for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic 
agent. This application is supported by data from two phase 3 induction studies (M14-431 and M14-
433) and one phase 3 maintenance study (M14-430 Substudy 1) which were all double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre studies (Figure 6 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 113/217 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3). 
Additional information is provided from the dose finding study (M13-740) and the ongoing long term 
extension study (M14-430 Substudy 2).  
These studies have been performed in both the US and EU as there are different expectances on the 
clinical outcomes where CDAI is used for the FDA analyses and PRO 2 is used for EU analyses. 
As stated in the EMA Guideline (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 2 Guideline on the development of new 
medicinal products for the treatment of Crohn’s disease) “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of Crohn’s 
disease, it is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided”. This is considered as fulfilled. 
The MAH also received Scientific Advice at the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3190/5/2017/II and clarification 
letter EMA/660515/2018), where the study design with two replicate phase 3 induction studies (M14-
431 and M14-433) and one phase 3 maintenance study (M14-430 Substudy 1) was discussed and 
approved. Most of the CHMP advice were followed with some minor deviations discussed below.  
The dose finding study (M13-740) included a double-blind (DB) placebo-controlled 16-week induction 
treatment that assessed the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics versus placebo followed by a 36-
week DB maintenance (extension) period. Subjects who completed Study M13-740 were eligible to 
enrol in the ongoing LTE Study M14-327. 
Dose selection was informed by the analysis of the 16-week safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and 
exposure-response data from Phase 2 CD Study M13-740, which evaluated 5 induction doses of 
upadacitinib using the immediate-release (IR) formulation (3, 6, 12, or 24 mg twice daily [BID] or 24 
mg QD) versus placebo. The results from Study M13-740 demonstrated the clinical and endoscopic 
efficacy of upadacitinib compared to placebo across several endpoints with doses of 6 mg BID and 
higher. Pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that the 12 mg BID and 24 mg BID doses of the IR 
formulation provided similar daily exposures to the 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD dose of the extended-
release (ER) formulation, respectively. Simulations based on the exposure-response analyses showed 
that doses higher than 45 mg QD (e.g., 60 mg QD) were predicted to provide minimal additional 
efficacy (2% to 5% increase), while a dose lower than 45 mg QD (e.g., 30 mg QD) predicted 5% to 
7% lower efficacy for the endoscopic endpoints compared to the 45 mg QD dose. 
Based on pathophysiology and data from other targeted immunomodulatory therapies, a lower dose 
for maintenance was expected to be effective once the initial high disease burden is reduced. 
Therefore, after induction treatment with 45 mg QD, 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses were chosen for 
maintenance treatment. 
The upadacitinib 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID doses used in the maintenance dose selection CD Phase 2 
Study M13-740 showed statistically significantly higher endoscopic response at Week 12/16 compared 
to placebo. Following induction with upadacitinib 45 mg QD, lower doses of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 
30 mg QD were therefore expected to maintain efficacy while minimizing dose dependent risks that 
may be observed with long-term use of higher doses.  
The chosen dosing regimen for the phase 3 study programme was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
The induction dosing regimen was discussed and endorsed in the CHMP advice. 
The Phase 3 program includes two induction studies (Study M14-431 and Study M14-433) which 
consist of an initial DB 12-week induction period with upadacitinib 45 mg with an unequal 
randomisation 2:1 for active treatment: placebo (ISE1 combined analyses induction studies). There 
was a possibility for additional 12-week extended treatment period with (1) upadacitinib 30 mg for 
subjects who did not achieve clinical response to upadacitinib 45 mg, or (2) upadacitinib 45 mg for 
subjects who did not achieve clinical response to placebo, at Week 12 of the induction Period. Study 
M14-431 also included an OL induction cohort to ensure a sufficient number of responders for Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 114/217 
 
 
 
 
M14-430. This is accepted but it was recommended in the CHMP scientific advice that OL cohort should 
be stratified in the maintenance study by the previous study source which has been performed. This 
has been performed by the MAH.  
Further, the separation of the conventional failure and biologic failure subgroups is endorsed. However, 
it would have been preferred from a clinical perspective to add an arm with active treatment, in study 
M14-433 to provide relevant evidence on the added clinical value after a 12-week induction treatment 
period with respect to the current standard of treatment in patients that have not previously failed 
biologics. However, this was not considered necessary with regard to an overall conclusion on benefit 
risk. Therefore, the lack of an active control arm in study M14-433 is acceptable. 
The two Phase 3 induction studies included adult subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age with a 
confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 months and moderately to severely active CD, with average 
daily very soft stool frequency (SF) score ≥ 4 or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) ≥ 2.0, and 
a centrally-read SES-CD ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ileal disease), excluding the narrowing 
component. 
The use of the PRO-2 criteria for AP and (soft) SF, and the use of the endoscopic appearance of the 
mucosa (the SES-CD) for inclusion of patients into a CD trial was discussed and accepted in the CHMP 
advice, and takes sufficiently account of the changing paradigms of CD treatment with the importance 
of symptoms and mucosal appearance, both for the definition of the severity of the disease, as well as 
the evaluation of efficacy (e.g. as reflected in the CHMP CD guideline).  
The chosen inclusion criteria, equal or higher than 4 for the stool frequency of stools with a baseline 
Bristol stool scale score of 6-7, or an average daily abdominal pain score of equal to or higher than 2 is 
accepted and in line with the CHMP advice. As CDAI was used historically the MAH has calculated that 
these inclusion criteria were met by 85% to 92% of subjects with baseline CDAI 220 to 450 based on 
pooled data from adalimumab studies. 
The inclusion and exclusion were similar but not identical in the two induction studies:  
- Study M14-431: Subjects should have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more 
biologic agents (Bio-IR) for CD (adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, 
and/or natalizumab). To be considered Bio-IR, subjects were required to meet criteria for types, doses, 
and durations of prior CD treatment as defined in the protocol. 
- Study M14-433: Subjects should have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional 
therapies but had not failed biologic therapy (Non-Bio-IR population) and/or one or more biologic 
agents for CD (Bio-IR population). 
The definitions of the inadequate response or intolerance to prior treatments is acceptable and in line 
with the CHMP advice and the EU SmPCs for induction regimens. Of note, certolizumab pegol has not a 
Crohn indication in the EU. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has clarified the use of 
immunosuppressants at baseline which was low and the timing when immunosuppressants were 
stopped (except MTX).  
Steroids were allowed but should be tapered beginning after 4 weeks of induction treatment. At the 
CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided the information concerning steroid usage during the induction 
and maintenance studies. In the induction studies patients in the active treatment groups that were 
treated with steroids at baseline had numerically higher doses compared to placebo but during the 12-
week induction treatment duration the standardized dose and proportion of patients were lower in the 
active treatment groups. This also holds true for the maintenance study at least for the median 
standardized steroid dose. However, the mean, but not the median, standardized steroid dose was 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 115/217 
 
 
 
 
practically equal in the active treatment groups compared to placebo. The reason for this is unclear but 
may be explained by some outliers. 
Concerning rescue treatment during the maintenance study, the lowest proportion of patients receiving 
rescue treatment with steroids was in the group treated with 30 mg UPA. In the placebo group a high 
proportion of patients received rescue treatment where 45.5% received OL UPA 30mg and 18.2% 
received steroids. The corresponding figures for the 15mg UPA treatment was 26.6% and 13.6% and 
in the 30 mg maintenance treatment group 21.4% received open-label UPA as rescue treatment and 
6.5% received steroids.  
In summary, it is agreed with the MAH that subject treated with active UPA for induction received 
lower steroid doses. This holds true for the median values in the maintenance study as well, although 
in the maintenance study the subjects had practically the same standardized mean steroid dose 
(approx. 13.5 mg prednisolone equivalent) during the study. This may be explained by outliers. 
Further, there were fewer subjects on steroids in the active treatment group both in induction and 
maintenance active treatment compared to placebo.  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that “In patients who have responded to treatment with upadacitinib, 
corticosteroids may be reduced and/or discontinued in accordance with standard of care.” 
The co primary endpoints used in the induction studies were: 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with clinical remission per SF/APS at Week 12, and 
Proportion of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 12. 
Clinical response was defined per SF/APS (≥ 30% decrease in average daily very soft or liquid SF 
and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily APS and both not worse than baseline), clinical remission per 
SF/APS (average daily very soft or liquid SF ≤ 2.8 and not worse than baseline and average daily APS 
≤ 1 and not worse than baseline) and enhanced SF/APS clinical response (≥ 60% decrease in average 
daily very soft or liquid SF and/or ≥ 35% decrease in average daily APS) and both not worse than 
baseline.  The clinical response criteria are acceptable to the CHMP. 
Endoscopic response is defined as decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline of the induction study (or 
for subjects with an SES-CD of 4 at Baseline of the induction study, at least a 2 point reduction from 
Baseline), as scored by central reviewer. 
Endoscopic remission is defined as SES-CD <= 4 and at least 2-point reduction from Baseline and no 
subscore > 1 in any individual variable, as scored by central reviewer. The endoscopic remission 
criteria are not so stringent as would have been expected. Please see below. 
The co primary endpoints are accepted although endoscopic remission would be the recommended 
endoscopic endpoint as discussed in the EMA CD guideline. But, for an induction study at a relatively 
early time point this may be acceptable. Further, endoscopic remission is a highly ranked secondary 
endpoint in the induction studies. In addition, there are more key secondary endpoints including 
proportion of subjects with clinical remission per CDAI (CDAI < 150) at week 12, proportion of 
subjects with clinical remission per PROs at Week 4 and proportion of subjects who discontinue 
corticosteroid use for CD and achieve clinical remission at Week 12, in subjects taking corticosteroids 
for CD at Baseline. 
However, the same co-primary endpoints are applied for the maintenance study evaluated at week 52. 
Here the endoscopic remission would be a more appropriate endpoint. Further, as discussed in the 
CHMP advice it is considered that even the definition of endoscopic remission is not so strong as 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 116/217 
 
 
 
 
expected.  The international organisation of IBD (IOIBD) has proposed a definition of SES-CD≤2. This 
endpoint is presented but not as a high ranked secondary endpoint.  
In addition, there are several highly ranked secondary endpoints such as proportion of subjects with 
clinical remission per CDAI (CDAI < 150), corticosteroid free remission, change in IBDQ and change in 
FACIT. The remaining secondary endpoints is considered adequate and especially the endpoint steroid 
free clinical remission is highly important. It would have been preferred to at least have the stringent 
endpoint for endoscopic remission SES-CD 0-2 as a higher ranked endpoint as the data is available. 
The definition of the disease severity for SES-CD score is 0-2 points healed, 3-6 points mild disease, 7-
16 points, moderate disease and severe disease>16. However, these are not defined for response of 
therapy. 
To conclude, the MAH has chosen the co-primary endpoint endoscopic response although endoscopic 
remission is the preferred endpoint in the updated EMA GL and also suggested in the CHMP advice. 
However, as several stringent endoscopic assessments including endoscopic remission (SES-CD ≤ 4 
and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline and no subscore > 1 in any individual variable) and 
mucosal heling (SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore of 0 in patients with SES-CD ulcerated surface 
subscore ≥ 1 at baseline) showed statistically significant and clinically relevant results this has been 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
This is one of the first MAAs for CD where PROs are used as a co-primary endpoint together with effect 
on intestinal mucosal inflammation as described in the updated EMA guidelines. This brings some 
uncertainty concerning the relevance of the endpoints. However, the PROs stool frequency and 
abdominal pain are often the most bothersome symptoms for the patients suffering from CD. The 
earlier CDAI score used in clinical trials for CD treatment includes these symptoms as well but also 
general wellbeing, the presence of extraintestinal symptoms, the presence of a palpable abdominal 
mass and has several limitations including a complex calculation and high score has been shown even 
for patient with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, with any of these symptoms score it is 
crucial to combine the clinical score with an endoscopic assessment as a co-primary endpoint which is 
the case in these studies. Further, the CDAI score was included as a ranked secondary endpoint in the 
EU and the co primary endpoint it the separate SAP for US/FDA. This makes it possible to a certain 
limit to compare the results for SF/APS and CDAI considering that CDAI has been used as an endpoint 
in previous applications for treatments of Crohn’s disease in EU as well. 
In general, the baseline demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in the treatment group 
in all main studies. However, there were slightly more men in the studies which is not in line with the 
general epidemiology of Crohn’s disease. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has indicated that one 
important factor for that less than half the subjects included in the study were female could be related 
to the strict contraception requirements for women of childbearing potential. As older studies usually 
have had a slightly higher proportion of women compared to men these requirements may have been 
strengthened by time. Further, the MAH has provided the results of the primary endpoint comparing 
the results between females and males. According to the MAH results are consistent among female vs 
male subjects but numerically, it seems that a higher proportion of men responded to treatment with 
UPA. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP and the issue was not further pursued. 
Baseline characteristics for patients that proceeded to the maintenance studies were similar to the 
patients in the induction studies.  
The sample size calculations and assumptions seem adequate. The number of subjects included is in 
line with earlier procedures and approvals concerning treatment in Crohn´s disease. 
The randomisation and blinding procedures are acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 117/217 
 
 
 
 
Within each study, different sets of primary and key secondary endpoints were defined for US/FDA and 
EU/EMA regulatory purposes. This is acceptable to CHMP. 
Each of the SAPs for the phase 3 studies was finalized prior to the respective database unblinding. 
All three phase 3 studies include several study parts and/or cohorts of patients. Several analysis 
populations have been defined accordingly. The ITT1 population is the population addressing the 
primary objective in each of the studies. 
The primary estimand for the primary endpoints for each of the phase 3 studies handles the 
intercurrent Event (ICE) premature discontinuation of study drug with a treatment policy approach and 
initiation or dose escalation of CD-related corticosteroids with a composite approach. This is acceptable 
to the CHMP. 
The handling of missing data due to COVID-19 is acceptable since it seems reasonable to assume such 
data to be missing at random (MAR). The missing data handling for binary endpoints is in line with the 
composite estimand. The MMRM method used for continuous endpoints is dependent on the MAR 
assumption. 
The overall type I error rate of the primary and the ranked secondary endpoints are controlled using 
the fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure. In the Maintenance study, alpha is split between the 
doses and a graphical procedure is applied. For each study those methods are standard and 
uncontroversial. In this context, the Maintenance study is regarded as a separate study although 
incorporating the same subjects as in the induction studies. This is acceptable since the maintenance 
study is considered to address a different scientific question. 
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH addressed the question of whether "inadequate response or lost 
response" relates to historical flares of the disease only, or to the current episode of high disease 
activity. The MAH was asked to discuss whether such a distinction of the patients can be made, and in 
case this is possible, analyse the subgroups for the main efficacy parameters. The MAH describes that 
the start date of the current episode of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) was not 
captured, and sites were not required to distinguish between current or historical treatment failures. As 
most subjects had failed two or more treatments, the number of subjects who had failed only 
conventional therapies or only a biologic, either in the past or recently, likely be inconclusive. This is 
accepted as in clinical practice, medications that has failed historically would seldom be prescribed 
again.  
In addition, a clarification of the definition of resolution of EIM, hereunder to clarify what kind of extra 
intestinal manifestations that improved/resolved and how the resolution was measured was requested 
by the CHMP. The MAH described how EIMs were analysed and further provided analyses of classic and 
arthopathy EIMs separately. Clinically relevant benefits of the resolution of EIMs were seen both in 
induction and maintenance study. This is an important finding and data on resolution of extra-
intestinal manifestation has been included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Induction studies M14-431 and M 14-433 
In the summary of efficacy, the MAH has presented the combined data from these studied stratified on 
bio experience. The results from these studies were similar and are discussed in conjunction in this 
section.

A total of 495 and 526 subjects were randomized in Study M14-431 (Bio-IR population) and Study 
M14-433 (Non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR populations), respectively.   
In Study M14-433, 45.4% of enrolled subjects were Bio-IR and 54.6% were Non-Bio-IR. Study M14-
431, by design, only enrolled subjects with prior inadequate response and intolerance to biologics, with 
60.8% of subjects having failed at least 2 biologics 
Study M14-431 included patients with incomplete response to biologic therapies. At week 12 the 
results for the clinical remission co-primary endpoint showed that 39.8% of subjects treated with 
45mg upa QD achieved clinical remission per PROs compared to 14% of the placebo. In the endoscopic 
co primary endpoint endoscopic response, 34.6% of patients in active treatment responded compared 
to 3.5% in the placebo group. For the US/FDA clinical co primary endpoint CDAI remission the 
corresponding figures were 38.9 % for active treatment and 21,1% for placebo. All these analyses had 
high statistical significance with p<0.0001. 
Induction study M14-433 included patients with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional 
therapies but had not failed biologic therapy (Non-Bio-IR population) and/or one or more biologic 
agents for CD (Bio-IR population). At week 12 the results for the co primary clinical endpoints showed 
that 50.7% of patients in active treatment responded with clinical remission per PROs compared to 
placebo 22.2%. For the co primary endpoint endoscopic response 45.5% responded in active 
treatment arm compared to 13.1% in placebo group. The corresponding figures for CDAI was 49.5% in 
active treatment with 29.1% in the placebo group. 
In both induction studies all the key secondary clinical endpoints such as corticosteroid free clinical 
remission and QoL showed highly statistically significance and clinically relevant results. 
Concerning the important endpoint key secondary endoscopic remission 19.1% reached this endpoint 
in study M14-431 compared to 2.3% in the placebo group. In study M14-433 the corresponding results 
were 28.9% and 7.4% respectively. In addition, the more stringent endoscopic remission endpoint 
(SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore-mucosal healing) showed beneficial results for active treatment 
where 17% reached this endpoint in study M13-431 compared to 0 patients in placebo group. In study 
M14-433 the corresponding figures were 25%& and 55 respectively p<0.0001.  
The induction dosing 45 mg QD in 12 weeks is acceptable. However, the proposal for extended 
induction treatment “For patients who have not achieved adequate therapeutic benefit after the initial 
12-week induction, prolonged induction for an additional 12 weeks with a dose of 30 mg once daily 
may be considered. For these patients, upadacitinib should be discontinued if there is no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after 24 weeks of treatment” was further discussed at the CHMP’s request: 
The patients in the extended treatment had longer treatment duration, were generally older but had 
approximately the same CDAI and SES-CD score. Interestingly the mean baseline laboratory values for 
(hs)CRP and FCP were lower in the extended treatment group. This might imply that, apart from being 
a treatment effect, some of these patients rather may suffer from a more permanent bowel 
impairment such as fibrosis. Therefore, the MAH was requested to further analyze if the patients 
responding to extended treatment had any signs of higher inflammatory burden such as objective 
laboratory markers (hs-CRP, FCP) to evaluate if that would be a possible option to guide the profession 
when deciding if a patient is a candidate for extended treatment. However, these analyses showed no 
support for using hs-CRP and FCP to guide which patients that may be appropriate for extended 
treatment. 
Further the MAH describes that over half of the patients receiving extended treatment achieved clinical 
SF/APS response and about a quarter of the patients reached clinical remission in SF/APS score at 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 119/217 
 
 
 
 
week 24. In addition, in the 35 subjects who had no improvement in SF nor in APS from Baseline to 
Week 12 one third achieved SF/APS clinical response at Week 24. 
The MAH states that there were no major differences in safety profiles between the 12-week induction 
with upadacitinib 45 mg and the 24-week treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg, with the 
exception of overall SAEs (primarily driven by worsening of CD). Further, there were no GI perforations 
during the extended treatment for the 122 subjects receiving extended treatment 30mg QD after 45 
mg QD induction treatment. See also 2.5.2.  
In conclusion, there seems to be a certain number of patients who benefit from extended treatment. 
Therefore, it could be beneficial for some patients to have the opportunity of extended treatment in 
this difficult to treat population. This is adequately reflected in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The results of the combined analyses of the induction studies for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints are in line with the results from the separate induction studies. 
Study M14-430 (Maintenance)  
The first 502 subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug in Study 
M14-430 Substudy 1 Cohort 1 were included in the ITT1 Population for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Among these subjects, 75.9% completed study treatment.  
Maintenance treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg was superior to placebo in achieving clinical 
remission (per CDAI and per SF/APS) and endoscopic response at Week 52. Most key secondary 
endpoints under the pre-defined strategy for overall Type-I error control were achieved with 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg treatment compared with placebo. Superiority was observed for 
endoscopic remission and the more stringent endpoint of deep remission (combined clinical and 
endoscopic remission), as well as for steroid-free clinical remission irrespective of steroid use at 
baseline. The result for the higher dose was overall more robust but clinically relevant results were 
found also for the lower maintenance dose.  
However, the definition of endoscopic co-primary endpoint at week 52 is not the most relevant as it is 
preferred to aim at endoscopic remission instead of response because it is assumed that it is important 
to achieve healing of the mucosa to prevent long-term structural complications in the bowel. However, 
as the totality of data especially including the more strictly defined endoscopic endpoints clinical 
remission SES-SD <4 and also SES-CD 0-2 met statistically significance that was deemed as clinically 
relevant and therefore it is considered that the efficacy on intestinal mucosa is shown. 
Most key secondary endpoints under the pre-defined strategy for overall Type-I error control were 
achieved with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg treatment compared with placebo. Superiority was 
observed for endoscopic remission and the more stringent endpoint of deep remission (combined 
clinical and endoscopic remission), as well as for steroid-free clinical remission irrespective of steroid 
use at Baseline. Maintenance of clinical remission was achieved among subjects in clinical remission at 
Week 0. Improvements from Baseline for FACIT-Fatigue and resolution of EIMs continued with 
upadacitinib 30 mg maintenance therapy. Results of stringent endoscopic assessments (absence of 
ulcers by endoscopy [US]/mucosal healing [EU], SES-CD 0-2) and mean changes in markers FCP and 
hs-CRP support continued improvement of inflammation up to Week 52 on upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 
mg QD. 
The suggested maintenance dosing gives an opportunity to choose between 15 or 30 mg QD according 
to the patient’s severity of disease and response to earlier treatment. This is accepted. However, as 
concluded in the JAK referral there are concerns regarding the 30 mg dose for long term treatment in 
patients with risk for MACE, malignancy and VTE. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, a statement was 
included in the SmPC. See also 2.5.1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 120/217 
 
 
 
 
The dosing recommendations for maintenance were therefore agreed as follows in Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC: 
The recommended maintenance dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual 
patient presentation: 
• 
A dose of 15 mg is recommended for patients at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy (see 
section 4.4). 
• 
A dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for patients with high disease burden who are 
not at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy (see section 4.4) or who do not show adequate 
therapeutic benefit to 15 mg once daily.  
• 
The lowest effective dose to maintain response should be used. 
The OLE is ongoing and relatively few individuals have reached the later visits. Data from week 100 
indicates a sustained efficacy of treatment. 
Altogether the clinical study programme in Crohn´s disease shows a robust clinical efficacy in nearly all 
chosen aspects of the disease. 
The following indication was submitted by the MAH: “Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate 
response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent, or for 
whom such therapies are not advisable.” 
This was in general acceptable based on the included patient population and vastly in line with other 
products with IBD indication including the UC indication for upadacitinib. However, the last section of 
the proposed indication “or for whom such therapies are not advisable” was not accepted by the CHMP 
as it is not in line with the population included. In response to the 1st Request for Supplementary 
Information (RSI), the MAH submitted a revised wording for the claimed indication in which this claim 
has been removed as requested by the CHMP: “RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response, lost 
response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.” The revised indication 
was acceptable to CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The two pivotal induction studies demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
superiority of Upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in inducing the co-primary endpoint, clinical 
remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. A superior efficacy was seen in 
symptomatic relieve already at week 2 (CR-100) and week 4 (SF/APS), and after 12 weeks of 
induction treatment with 45 mg upadacitinib QD, 45.5% of patients achieved clinical SF/APS remission 
with active treatment compared to 18.2% in the placebo group in the integrated analyses. Further, 
important clinical key secondary endpoints such as steroid free clinical remission and QoL showed 
highly statistically significant and clinically relevant result at week 12.  
The co-primary endpoint endoscopic response has well demonstrated a significant difference between 
active treatment and placebo in the integrated induction analyses with 40.3% responders in active 
treatment compared to 8.4% in placebo group. For endoscopic remission the corresponding figures 
were 24.4% and 4.9% for active treatment and placebo. In addition, Upadacitinib provided a beneficial 
effect compared to placebo regarding the strictest endpoint, mucosal healing (SES-CD) at week 12 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 121/217 
 
 
 
 
with a treatment difference of 17% and 20% respectively for study M14-431 and M14-433 compared 
to placebo This is an important finding. 
In the maintenance study statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically relevant treatment 
differences between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the 
co-primary and all key secondary endpoints with the exception of CD hospitalisation and effect on 
extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) for the 15 mg. There was a clear dose response showing more 
robust effect with the higher maintenance dosing. For example, clinical remission per SF/APS score 
was reached by 46.4% of patients treated with 30 mg maintenance dosing compared to 35.5% treated 
with 15 mg. The corresponding figure for placebo was 15.1%. Especially in patients with a high disease 
burden and in patients in need of a prolonged induction regimen, the 30 mg dose seemed to provide a 
more pronounced beneficial effect over the 15 mg dose. This is adequately reflected in the Section 4.2 
of the SmPC. 
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH accepted to revise the indication as follows: “RINVOQ is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic 
agent.” 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy shown in the clinical program investigating upadacitinib in the 
treatment of Crohn’s disease is robust and clinically relevant. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The upadacitinib CD global clinical development program consists of a Phase 2 induction and 
maintenance study (Study M13-740), a Phase 2 OLE study (Study M14-327), two Phase 3 induction 
studies (Study M14-431 and Study M14-433), a Phase 3 maintenance study (Study M14-430 Substudy 
1), and a LTE study (Study M14-430 Substudy 2).  
The Phase 2 clinical development program evaluated 5 induction doses (3, 6, 12, and 24 mg BID and 
24 mg QD) and 4 maintenance doses (3, 6 and 12 mg BID and 24 mg QD) of upadacitinib in Study 
M13-740 and 2 OLE doses (15 mg and 30 mg QD) in Study M14-327.  
The Phase 3 clinical development program evaluated 1 induction dose of upadacitinib (45 mg once 
QD), and 2 maintenance/LTE doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg QD).  In the Phase 2 Study 
M13-740, upadacitinib was administered as an immediate-release formulation, while in the Phase 2 
M14-327 and Phase 3 studies, upadacitinib was administered as the once-daily extended-release 
formulation.   
To assess the safety of upadacitinib across clinical studies, subject data were integrated into 6 analysis 
sets. In addition, an additional analysis set was created for Study M14-430 Substudy 2 (M14-430_2), 
given that the CSR presented in the submission comprises Substudy 1 only.  The M14-430_2 Analysis 
set includes only data collected within Study M14-430 Substudy 2:

Patient exposure 
In the upadacitinib CD global Phase 3 studies, the short and long-term safety profile of upadacitinib in 
subjects with moderately to severely active CD is supported by data from 833 subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of upadacitinib and at least 1 dose of study drug during maintenance/LTE.  This group of 
subjects had a mean duration of 75.4 weeks.  Of these subjects, 536 (64.3%) and 244 (29.3%) had 
exposure to upadacitinib for at least 1 year and 2 years, respectively. 
Table 48 Number and Percentage of Subjects Exposed to Study Drug by Duration 
Intervals (PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Sets) 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, there were 142 subjects who received at least 1 dose of UPA 45 mg QD 
during the 12-week induction period, did not achieve clinical response, and received at least 1 dose of 
UPA 30 mg QD in the 12-week extended treatment period. The mean (SD) exposure to upadacitinib 45 
mg/30 mg was 22.8 (2.85) weeks.

Table 55 Overview of TEAEs per 100 PY (ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set) 
Common Adverse Events 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the most frequent TEAEs by SOC were infections and infestations (UPA 
30.1%, placebo 18.2%), gastrointestinal disorders (UPA 25.4%, Placebo 31.7%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (UPA 15.6%, Placebo 11.6%) and  musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (UPA 8.3%, Placebo 14.4%). The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5.0% of 
subjects) were acne, nasopharyngitis, anaemia, and headache in the upadacitinib 45 mg group and 
worsening of CD, arthralgia, and anaemia in the placebo group.  Except for reports of worsening CD in 
the placebo group, no other TEAE PT occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects in any treatment group.  Among 
the frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 2% of subjects), the frequency of acne, influenza, herpes zoster, and 
blood creatine phosphokinase increased were higher in the upadacitinib group compared with the 
placebo group, while worsening CD and arthralgia were more frequent in the placebo group compared 
with the upadacitinib group. 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, the EAERs for the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg group through Week 24 were generally similar to rates reported during the 
initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment; except higher rates of worsening of CD (53.2 E/100 
PY vs 39.6 E/100 PY), influenza (16.1 E/100 PY vs 12.2 E/ 100 PY), and herpes zoster(11.3 E/100 PY 
vs 9.1 E/100 PY). 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) was Crohn's 
disease in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, COVID-19 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, and anemia, 
Crohn's disease, nausea, and arthralgia in the placebo group. The EAERs of TEAEs reported at ≥ 5 
E/100 PY in the placebo group were generally higher than or similar to those in the upadacitinib 
groups; exceptions included COVID-19 in both upadacitinib groups and upper respiratory tract 
infection in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, which occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo group. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) were 
worsening of CD and nasopharyngitis in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort and worsening of CD in 
the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort.

Adverse Drug Reactions proposed for inclusion in the SmPC 
The MAH states that assessment of the induction and maintenance data from the CD clinical program 
did not identify any new ADRs beyond those currently listed in the upadacitinib label.  The rate of 
pneumonia was >1% in both upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups of the CD study resulting in a 
proposed labeling change to update the frequency from uncommon to common.  The ADRs identified in 
the CD clinical program are presented for induction and maintenance treatment respectively below.

Serious adverse events 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was similar in the upadacitinib 45 
mg group (8.0%) compared with the placebo group (8.4%).  Most SAEs were reported in no more than 
1 subject in each group, except for worsening of CD (14 [2.1%] subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group and 15 [4.3%] subjects in the placebo group); GI haemorrhage and intestinal obstruction (3 
[0.4%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 mg group); anal abscess (3 [0.4%] subjects in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group and 3 [0.9%] subjects in the placebo group); and abdominal pain, ileus, and 
nephrolithiasis (2 [0.3%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 mg group). 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, the EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs increased with longer duration of 
exposure to upadacitinib, primarily driven by worsening of CD (64.5 E/100 PY through Week 24 
compared with 51.8 E/100 PY during the initial 12 weeks of treatment).  Fourteen SAEs of worsening 
Assessment report

CD were reported through Week 24 (4 events with onset during the induction period with upadacitinib 
45 mg and 10 events with onset during the extended treatment period with upadacitinib 30 mg).  
Through Week 24, the SAEs of intestinal obstruction and abdominal wall abscess were each reported 
twice.  All other SAEs were reported only once. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs was higher in the placebo 
group (31.8 E/100 PY) compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg (16.9 E/100 PY) and 30 mg (18.0 E/100 
PY) groups.  The rates of SAEs of Crohn's disease were 8.0, 3.6, and 1.5 E/100 PY in subjects receiving 
placebo, 15 mg, and 30 mg, respectively.  Most SAEs were reported no more than once in each group, 
except for worsening of CD (11 subjects in the placebo group, 8 subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
group, and 4 subjects in the upadacitinib 30 mg group); anal abscess (4 events in the upadacitinib 15 
mg group); anal fistula (3 events in the upadacitinib 30 mg group); constipation and nephrolithiasis (2 
events each in the placebo group); ileus, appendicitis, and hydronephrosis (2 events each in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group); and and anaemia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, COVID-19 pneumonia, 
and cellulitis (2 events each in the upadacitinib 30 mg group).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Serious Infections:   
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with serious infections was similar in subjects 
receiving upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo (1.9% and 1.7%, respectively). The most commonly 
reported serious infections were of gastrointestinal infections, including PTs of abdominal wall abscess, 
anal abscess, colonic abscess, rectal abscess, and retroperitoneal abscess. The only serious infections 
by PT reported in ≥ 1 subject in any group was anal abscess reported in both treatment groups (3 in 
the upadacitinib 45 mg group and 3 in the placebo group). One subject in each treatment group had a 
serious infection that led to discontinuation of study drug. Results in the upadacitinib 45 mg group 
from the 45_IND Analysis Set were similar to those from the PC_IND Analysis Set (2.2% serious 
infections). 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, the EAER of serious infections with up to 24 weeks of induction and 
extended treatment (19.4 E/100 PY) was similar to the rate reported during the initial 12 weeks of 
induction treatment (21.3 E/100 PY) 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAERs of TEAEs of serious infections were lower in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups compared with the placebo group, with lower rates observed in 
the upadacitinib 15 mg group compared with upadacitinib 30 mg group (table below). Similar to the 
induction treatment  gastrointestinal infections were the most commonly reported serious infections.

Herpes Zoster 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs of herpes zoster was 
15 (2.2%) in the upadacitinib 45 mg group; no subject reported a TEAE of herpes zoster in the placebo 
group.  Among the reported cases of herpes zoster, one was severe, none were serious.  Three herpes 
zoster events led to discontinuation of study drug and 10 events led to study drug interruption. Of the 
15 cases of herpes zoster, 8 (53.3%) involved 1 dermatome, 5 (33.3%) involved 2 dermatomes, and 3 
(20.0%) involved ≥ 3 dermatomes. Twenty total cases of herpes zoster were reported in the 45_IND 
Analysis Set and of the 5 additional cases, one resulted in study drug discontinuation, but none were 
severe or serious. None of the herpes zoster cases had non-cutaneous or ophthalmic involvement. 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, the EAER of TEAEs of herpes zoster increased with longer duration of 
exposure to study drug (11.3 E/100 PY [7 events cumulative] during 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 
mg/30 mg treatment compared with 9.1 E/100 PY [3 events] during the initial 12 weeks of 
upadacitinib 45 mg treatment).  None of the events were considered severe or serious or led to 
discontinuation of study drug, but five events resulted in interruption of study drug. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAER of herpes zoster was higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group 
compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups. No events of herpes zoster were serious or 
led to discontinuation of study drug.  One event each in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups was 
severe.  Herpes zoster cutaneous involvement included 1 dermatome for subjects in the placebo group 
and 1 or 2 dermatomes for subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups. One event in the 
placebo group had ophthalmic involvement.  None of the herpes zoster cases reported in the 
upadacitinib groups had non-cutaneous or ophthalmic involvement. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, the EAER of herpes zoster was similar among the 
upadacitinib cohorts.  The EAERs for these cohorts were higher compared with subjects on placebo. 
Only 1 herpes zoster event, which occurred in the rescue upadacitinib 30 mg group, was serious.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 138/217 
 
 
 
 
 
During the study, the subject received upadacitinib 45 mg as induction treatment and placebo as 
maintenance treatment, followed by rescue therapy with OL upadacitinib 30 mg.  On Day 144 of 
upadacitinib exposure, the subject began experiencing the TEAE of herpes zoster that was considered 
ongoing at data cutoff. The event was moderate and required hospitalization and study drug was 
interrupted.  The investigator considered the TEAE of herpes zoster as having no reasonable possibility 
of being related to study drug. No herpes zoster TEAEs led to discontinuation of study drug, and most 
events were mild or moderate in severity. Most experienced events involving 1 or 2 dermatomes. Two 
subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg and upadacitinib 45 mg/placebo cohorts and 4 subjects 
in the rescue upadacitinib 30 mg cohort experienced events involving 3 or more dermatomes.  Four 
subjects experienced events with ophthalmic involvement (2 in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort 
and 1 each in the rescue upadacitinib 30 mg and upadacitinib 45 mg/placebo cohorts).  No events 
involved CNS or other internal organs. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, subgroup analysis by geographic region revealed a higher 
rate of herpes zoster in Asia (8.2 E/100 PY) compared to other regions (rates ranged from 3.6 to 5.3 
E/100 PY). Analysis by age group for the any upadacitinib responders cohort revealed that subjects ≥ 
50 to < 65 years of age had the highest rate of herpes zoster, followed by subjects < 50 years of age. 
The risk of herpes zoster was also higher in subjects with prior history of herpes zoster compared to 
those without. In the upadacitinib CD global clinical development program, approximately 7.0% of 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib indicated a prior history of zoster vaccination.  
The rate of herpes zoster events was observed to be lower in subjects who had history of zoster 
vaccination (2.1 E/100 PY) than in subjects who were unvaccinated (5.7 E/100 PY) The risk of subjects 
having herpes zoster events increased with time for subjects who received upadacitinib 45 mg during 
induction or extended treatment (up to Week 24). The cumulative incidence proportion over time was 
higher for those subjects who received 15 mg or 30 mg as maintenance or rescue treatment compared 
to the other treatment cohorts.  
The EAERs of TEAEs of herpes zoster were highest in the rescue upadacitinib 30 mg group (13 events; 
5.1 E/100 PY), followed in descending order by the upadacitinib 15 mg (3 events; 3.9 E/100 PY), 
upadacitinib 30 mg (4 events; 3.4 E/100 PY), and placebo (0 events) groups.  No TEAEs of herpes 
zoster were serious or led to study drug discontinuation.

In the PC_IND Analysis Set, mean (SD) increases in ALT and AST at Week 12 from Baseline were 
observed for the upadacitinib 45 mg group, while values of ALT and AST generally remained 
unchanged from Baseline for the placebo group. Laboratory values of ALT or bilirubin increases were

mostly CTCAE Grade 2 elevations. Three (0.4%) subjects had a Grade 4 AST increase (≥ 20 × ULN) 
and no subject had a Grade 4 ALT increase.  No placebo subjects experienced above a Grade 2 ALT, 
AST, or bilirubin value up through Week 12 of induction treatment.  There was one case that met the 
criteria of biochemical Hy's Law. The details of the Hy's Law case who also had grade 4 AST elevation 
and the 2 additional subjects with Grade 4 AST increase are provided below:  
•  One subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg group of Study M14-431 met the criteria for biochemical 
Hy's Law case (ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN and concurrent TBL > 2 × ULN).  On Day 57 ALT 
levels rose to ≥ 5 × ULN (196 U/L), returned to just above the normal range at Day 64 (39 
U/L), and then increased to ≥ 10 × ULN (630 U/L) the following day.  The subject's AST levels 
were high (98 U/L) on Day 57, returned to normal range on Day 64 (32 U/L), and then 
increased to ≥ 20 × ULN (815 U/L) on Day 65, also an increase in bilirubin from within the 
normal range (13 μmol/L) on Day 64 to ≥ 2 × ULN (47 U/L) on Day 65 was observed.  The 
subject had a concurrent AE of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.  By Day 77 ALT, AST, and 
bilirubin values were approaching or were within normal range:  42 U/L, 26 U/L, and 11 
μmol/L, respectively.  Study drug was interrupted for 9 days and then restarted, and event did 
not recur. 
•  One subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg group of Study M14-430 with a slightly above normal 
AST value (38 U/L) and a normal ALT value (40 U/L) at Baseline experienced an AST ≥ 20 × 
ULN(1334 U/L) and an ALT ≥ 10 × ULN  (953 U/L) on Day 40, after experiencing septic shock 
on Day 39.  At the next assessment on Day 44, AST and ALT values had decreased to ≥ 3 × 
ULN (159 U/L) and ≥ 5 × ULN (405 U/L), respectively.  By Day 58 AST and ALT further 
decreased to 33 U/L (within the normal range) and 50 U/L (above ULN). Study drug was 
ongoing, and the subject had a relevant medical history of elevated liver function tests. 
Concomitant medications included paracetamol, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and lisinopril. 
•  One subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg group of Study M14-431 experienced elevations of AST 
and ALT on Days 29 and 32, respectively:  AST of 464 U/L (≥ 10 × ULN) and 775 U/L (≥ 20 × 
ULN) and ALT of 79 U/L (above ULN) and 206 U/L (≥ 3 × ULN).  This subject also experienced 
Grade 4 CPK elevations on Day 29 (47520 U/L) and Day 32 (40640 U/L).  Values of AST and 
ALT at all other study visits, including Baseline, were within normal range. 
The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of hepatic disorders was similar in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group and the placebo group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs of hepatic disorder (> 1 subject 
within a treatment group) were hepatic function abnormal, AST increased, ALT increased, and blood 
bilirubin increased in the upadacitinib 45 mg group and ALT increased and AST increased in the 
placebo group.   
No serious TEAEs of hepatic disorder were reported.  Treatment-emergent adverse events of hepatic 
disorders were primarily mild or moderate in severity. Two subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group 
and 1 subject in the placebo group discontinued study drug due to a TEAE of hepatic disorder.  
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, there was no mean (SD) increase from Baseline in ALT observed with 
extended treatment of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg at Week 24. Slight mean (SD) increases from 
Baseline in AST were observed at Week 24 with the extended treatment of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg 
treatment compared to upadacitinib 45 mg at Week 12 (3.8 [15.93] and 3.1 [9.64] U/L, respectively).  
The number and percentages of subjects with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN and AST ≥ 5 × ULN were 4 (2.8%) and 5 
(3.5%), respectively. The EAER of TEAEs of hepatic disorder in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg group 
through Week 24 (11.3 E/100 PY [7 events]) was slightly lower than the rate observed during the 
initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment (15.2 E/100 PY [5 events]). No TEAE of hepatic 
disorder during the 24 weeks of treatment was severe, serious  or led to discontinuation of study drug.

RESP_MAIN Analysis Set Mean increases in ALT and AST at Week 52 from Baseline were observed in 
all treatment groups, with larger mean (SD) increases occurring in the upadacitinib 15 mg (5.6 [17.45] 
U/L and 8.6 [12.02] U/L, respectively) and 30 mg (7.9 [22.60] U/L and 8.5 [15.63] U/L, respectively) 
groups compared with the placebo group (3.1 [10.51] U/L and 1.9 [6.84] U/L, respectively). The 
percentage of subjects with ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN was low and slightly higher in the upadacitinib 15 
mg group compared with the upadacitinib 30 mg and placebo groups.  ALT ≥ 10 × ULN was reported 
in 1 subject each in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups.  One subject in the upadacitinib 15 
mg group had transient elevations of AST ≥ 20 × ULN, however this subject experienced concurrent 
and one subject in the upadacitinib 30 mg group met the biochemical criteria for Hy's Law 
The subject in M14-430 experienced transient Grade 3 ALT and AST elevations on Day 451:   ALT (594 
U/L [> 10.0 × ULN]), AST (1579 U/L [> 20.0 × ULN]), ALP (46 U/L), and Bilirubin (5 μmol/L) that 
improved on Day 466:  ALT (81 U/L) and AST (53 U/L).  The subject experienced concurrent AEs of 
ALT increased, AST increased, and rhabdomyolysis (induced by exercise) on Day 538.  The subject had 
a relevant medical history of abnormal liver function.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.   
Study drug was ongoing. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, mean increases in ALT and AST from Baseline were observed 
in the upadacitinib 45 mg/placebo, upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg, and upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohorts. 
The percentages of subjects with ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and AST ≥ 3 × ULN were higher in the upadacitinib 45 
mg/30 mg cohort compared with the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort. The percentages of subjects 
with ALT ≥ 5 × ULN were low (≤ 1.3%) and comparable between the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg and 
upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohorts. The percentages of subjects with AST ≥ 5 × ULN were numerically 
higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort compared with the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort 
(2.3% vs. 1.8%). ALT ≥ 10 × ULN were reported in no more than 1 subject in any mutually exclusive 
cohort (i.e., all cohorts except for the any upadacitinib responder’s cohort). AST ≥ 10 x ULN was noted 
in 2 subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort. According to the MAH, most elevations in ALT 
and/or AST were confounded by use of concomitant medications and relevant past medical history.  
One subject, in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort, met the biochemical criteria for Hy's Law: ALT 
and/or AST > 3 × ULN and concurrent TBL > 2 × ULN (within 30 days). A second subject, in the 
rescue upadacitinib 30 mg cohort, was a borderline Hy's law case with ALT and AST > 3 × ULN and 
concurrent TBL > 1.5 × ULN. The details of these 2 cases are provided below. 
• 
The subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort had ALT above the ULN (59 U/L), AST 
within the normal range (33 U/L), and TBL > 1.5 × ULN (37 μmol/L) at Baseline. On Day 312 
ALT was > 3 × ULN (175 U/L), AST was above the ULN (101 U/L), and TBL was > 2 × ULN (45 
U/L). All values had slightly decreased by Day 381 but were still above the ULN. By Day 451 
ALT and AST values had decreased to 122 U/L and 65 U/L, respectively, and remained steady 
through the data cutoff. The subject has relevant past medical history of hepatic steatosis and 
Gilbert's syndrome. No concurrent AE was reported at the time of liver enzyme elevations, 
study drug was ongoing, and liver enzymes improved with no recurrence of event. 
• 
The subject in the rescue upadacitinib 30 mg cohort had Baseline values of ALT, AST, and TBL 
of 71 U/L (above the ULN), 34 U/L (within normal range), and 15 μmol/L (within normal 
range), respectively. Throughout study treatment, the subject experienced ALT and AST values 
ranging from 82 to 155 U/L and from 65 to 164 U/L, respectively. At the last recorded visit, the 
subject had ALT and AST values > 3 × ULN (155 U/L and 116 U/L, respectively) and a TBL 
value > 1.5 × ULN (41 μmol/L), which was just under 2 × ULN (ULN = 21 μmol/L). Subject 
had relevant medical history of gallstones, obesity, and elevated liver function tests.

Anemia 
In the upadacitinib CD global Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, all subjects at study entry were required to 
have a haemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL (induction Studies M13-740, M14-431, and M14-433) or ≥ 8 g/dL 
(maintenance and LTE Studies M14-327 and M14-430). The protocols mandated interruption of study 
drug if a subject's haemoglobin value (confirmed by repeat testing) was < 8.0 g/dL or decreased  
≥ 3.0 g/dL (or > 2.0 g/dL in study M13-740) from baseline without an alternative aetiology, until the 
haemoglobin values returned to the normal reference range or its baseline value. 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, mean (SD) decreases in hemoglobin at Week 12 from Baseline were 
observed and were numerically greater in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (-3.4 [13.87] g/L) compared 
with the placebo group (–1.0 [12.16] g/L).  A greater number and percentage of subjects had Grade 3 
hemoglobin decreases in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (18 [2.7%]) compared with the placebo group 
(5 [1.4%]). The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of anemia was numerically higher in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group (7.4%) compared with the placebo group (5.5%).  Most TEAEs of anemia 
were mild or moderate. Five subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg and 1 subject in the placebo group had 
severe anemia. Two subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group and 1 subject in the placebo group had a 
serious TEAE of anemia. 
Extended induction: In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, a mean (SD) decrease in hemoglobin from Baseline,  
observed at Week 12 of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment (–6.4 [14.55] g/L), did not further decrease 
through Week 24 of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment (–3.4 [15.31] g/L). Potentially clinically 
significant decreases in hemoglobin of ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 9 subjects in the EXT_TRT Analysis Set. 
The EAER of TEAEs of anemia decreased with longer duration of exposure to study drug (35.5 E/100 
PY [22 events cumulative] during 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment compared with 
48.7 E/100 PY [16 events] during the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment).  One SAE of 
iron deficiency anemia was reported during the 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment. One 
TEAE of anemia was severe and no TEAE of anemia led to discontinuation of study drug during the 24 
weeks of treatment. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean hemoglobin values increased from Baseline in the upadacitinib 
groups and fluctuated slightly in the placebo group over time, where at Week 52, mean (SD) changes 
in hemoglobin from Baseline were 7.2 (17.51) g/L, 2.9 (15.93) g/L, and –2.8 (10.56) g/L for the 
upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, and placebo groups, respectively  A numerically higher 
percentage of subjects with Grade 3 hemoglobin decreases was noted in the upadacitinib 30 mg group 
compared to the placebo and upadacitinib 15 mg groups; however, the rate was numerically lower in 
the upadacitinib 15 mg group compared to the placebo group. 
Neutropenia 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, a mean (SD) decrease in neutrophil count at Week 12 from Baseline were 
observed for the upadacitinib 45 mg group (–0.939 [2.7008] × 109/L).  A small mean (SD) decrease 
was observed in the placebo group (–0.090 [2.3154] × 109/L). Grade 3 neutrophil count decreases 
were reported only in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (6/670 (0.9%). No Grade 4 decreases were 
observed. The percentage of subjects with TEAEs of neutropenia was higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg 
group (2.1%) compared with the placebo group (0.3%). All TEAEs of neutropenia were mild or 
moderate in severity and no subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE of neutropenia. 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, a mean (SD) decrease in neutrophil count from Baseline was generally 
maintained through Week 20 of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment.  One subject had a Grade 4 (< 
0.5 × 109/L) neutrophil count (0.390 × 109/L) on Day 114 that returned to within normal range on 
Day 120 (3.891 × 109/L) and continued to rise and remained within normal range on Day 163  which 
was the last recorded value. The subject was reported as having an SAE of severe febrile neutropenia

that began on Day 117 of upadacitinib 30 mg treatment and ended on Day 122. The subject was 
hospitalized and treated with G-CSF, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and neutropenic diet.  No 
other etiology for the fever was identified, the neutropenic fever resolved, and the subject was 
discharged from the hospital.  The subject was discontinued from the study.  The investigator 
considered the SAE as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. No other TEAE of 
neutropenia was severe, serious  or led to discontinuation of study drug. The EAER of TEAEs of 
neutropenia did not increase with longer duration of exposure to upadacitinib (6.5 E/100 PY [4 events 
cumulative] during 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment compared with 9.1 E/100 PY [3 
events] during the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment)  
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean decreases in neutrophil count were observed in both 
upadacitinib and placebo groups at most timepoints during the treatment period. Grade 3 neutrophil 
count decreases were reported in the upadacitinib groups only.  The percentage of subjects with Grade 
3 neutrophil count decreases was higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group compared with the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group (2.6% and 1.4%, respectively).  No subject experienced a Grade 4 
neutrophil count decrease. The EAER of TEAEs of neutropenia was higher in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
(3.1 E/100 PY) and 30 mg (2.3 E/100 PY) groups compared with the placebo (0.7 E/100 PY) group. No 
TEAE of neutropenia was serious or severe. One event of moderate neutropenia in the upadacitinib 30 
mg group led to discontinuation of study drug and was considered by the investigator to have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
Lymphopenia 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, no notable mean (SD) change from Baseline in lymphocyte  
count over the 12-week induction treatment was observed in the upadacitinib 45 mg group. Individual 
Grade 2 lymphocyte count decreases were reported more frequently with upadacitinib 45 mg 
compared with placebo treatment. The percentage of subjects with Grade 3 lymphocyte count 
decreases was 1.7% in the placebo group and 2.2% in the upadacitinib 45 mg group. One subject in 
the placebo group and no subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group experienced a Grade 4 lymphocyte 
count decrease. One subject from Study M14-431 who received DB placebo during Part 1 induction and 
DB upadacitinib 45 mg during Part 3 extended  
treatment experienced a Grade 4 lymphocyte count  on Day 145 that improved to Grade 2 by Day 168, 
the last reported lymphocyte value for this subject.  No TEAE of lymphopenia or infectious AE was 
reported for this subject. The percentage of subjects with the TEAEs of lymphopenia was 2.3% and 
1.6% for the placebo and upadacitinib 45 mg.  Most TEAEs of lymphopenia were mild or moderate.  No 
serious TEAE of lymphopenia and no discontinuations of study drug due to lymphopenia were reported 
in the upadacitinib 45 mg group.  In the 45_IND Analysis Set, one subject experienced a severe TEAE 
of lymphopenia (reported as worsening lymphopenia) that resulted in discontinuation of study drug.  
The event was not serious and considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of 
being related to study drug. 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, mean decreases in lymphocyte count from Baseline was generally 
maintained through Week 24 of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment. Six Grade 3 lymphocyte count 
decreases were observed up to 24 weeks in subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg. According to 
the MAH these decreases appeared to be transient.  No Grade 4 lymphocyte count decreases were 
noted. The EAER of TEAEs of lymphopenia were similar between longer duration of exposure to 
upadacitinib (6.5 E/100 PY [4 events cumulative] during 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg 
treatment compared with 6.1 E/100 PY [2 events] during the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg 
treatment).  No TEAE of lymphopenia was serious or led to discontinuation of study drug during the 24 
weeks of treatment.  During the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment, 1 severe event (3.0

E/100 PY) of lymphopenia was reported versus 2 severe events cumulative (3.2 E/100 PY) during 24 
weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean changes in lymphocyte counts for the upadacitinib 15 mg and 
30 mg groups fluctuated slightly above or below the Baseline value through Week 22 after which mean 
decreases from Baseline were observed through Week 52.  At Week 52, the mean (SD) changes in 
lymphocyte count from Baseline were –0.450 (0.8348) and – 0.288 (0.5936) × 109/L for the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups, respectively, which were greater than the –0.151 (0.5138) × 
109/L seen in the placebo group.The percentage of subjects with Grade 3 lymphocyte count decreases 
were reported in a higher percentage in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups compared with the 
placebo group.  No subject experienced a Grade 4 lymphocyte count decrease. 
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, a mean (SD) increase at Week 12 from Baseline was observed for CPK in 
the upadacitinib 45 mg group (122.6 [540.87] U/L), while a mean (SD) decrease at Week 12 from 
Baseline was observed in the placebo group (–174.8 [2713.09] U/L). Grade 3 CPK increases were 
more frequent in the upadacitinib 45 mg compared with the placebo group. Grade 4 CPK increases 
were reported in < 2.0% of subjects in both the upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo groups. The 
percentage of subjects with TEAEs of CPK elevation (PT blood creatine phosphokinase increased) was 
higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (3.0%) compared with the placebo group (1.1%). Most TEAEs 
of CPK elevation were mild or moderate and no event was serious  or led to discontinuation of study 
drug. No event of rhabdomyolysis was reported. 
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, mean CPK values were elevated at Week 12 after upadacitinib 45 mg 
treatment and remained elevated through Week 24 of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment. Five 
(3.5%) subjects experienced ≥ Grade 3 CPK elevation, 4 of whom experienced a Grade 4 elevation (. 
One subject from Study M14-431 had 2 consecutive elevated CPK values: 47520.00 U/L on Day 29 and 
40640.00 U/L on Day 32, associated with exercise/other vigorous physical activity. By Day 40 the 
subject's CPK decreased to 161.00 U/L. Among the 4 subjects with Grade 4 elevation, associated 
conditions included 1 subject with septic shock, 1 subject who had a snowboarding accident with 
muscle strain reported, and 2 subjects with AST/ALT increases without other reported symptoms. The 
EAER of TEAEs of CPK elevation during 24 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg treatment through 
Week 24 (17.7 E/100 PY, 11 events cumulative) was lower than the rate observed during the initial 12 
weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment (21.3 E/100 PY,7 events) 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean increases in CPK from Baseline for each treatment group were 
observed at most visits through Week 52. There was a dose-dependent increased percentage of 
subjects who experienced ≥ Grade 3 CPK elevation for upadacitinib; the rates of these elevated CPK 
were higher compared to the placebo group. Most Grade 3 and Grade 4 elevations of CPK were 
transient and returned to within normal range by the following assessment date.  
•  One subject receiving upadacitinib 30 mg presented with rhabdomyolysis at Day 868 that 
lasted 12 days. The rhabdomyolysis was considered to be a complication of COVID-19 
infection. This subject also experienced concurrent acute kidney injury. 
•  One subject receiving upadacitinib 15 mg presented with a CPK elevation (70060 U/L) at Day 
533, which was reported as exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis with no sign and symptoms by 
the investigator. The event resolved without treatment discontinuation. The investigator 
assessed the rhabdomyolysis as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug, 
with an alternative etiology of exercise or other vigorous physical activity.

Renal Dysfunction 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, a small mean increase (SD) at Week 12 from Baseline was observed for 
creatinine in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (4.9 [10.71] μmol/L), which was higher than the placebo 
group (1.3 [9.73] μmol/L). Grade 2 creatinine increases were reported at similar frequencies in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg (1.5%) and placebo (0.9%) groups. No Grade 3 or 4 increase in creatinine was 
reported in either treatment group in the PC_IND Analysis Set. Results in the upadacitinib 45 mg group 
from the 45_IND Analysis Set were similar to those from the PC_IND Analysis Set. One subject who 
received OL upadacitinib 45 mg as induction treatment in Study M14-431 (Part 2) experienced a Grade 
4 (> 6.0 × ULN) increase in creatinine (6807 μmol/L). The Grade 4 increase coincided with an SAE of 
severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Study drug was interrupted due to the SAE.  
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, mean (SD) increases in creatinine were reported at Week 12 of 
upadacitinib 45 mg induction treatment (4.9 [9.72] μmol/L) and at Week 24 of upadacitinib 45 mg/30 
mg treatment (6.9 [9.30] μmol/L)  One subject from Study M14-433 with a history of chronic kidney 
disease, experienced an SAE of severe renal dysfunction (PT of acute kidney injury) that began on Day 
121 during upadacitinib 30 mg treatment after an SAE of upper respiratory tract infection. Study drug 
was discontinued due to this SAE and the investigator considered the acute kidney injury to have no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. This same subject experienced a Grade 3 
creatinine value of 385 μmol/L on Day 123 that was > 3.0 × Baseline value of 97 μmol/L. Creatinine 
for this subject decreased to 278 μmol/L (Grade 2) by Day 133. No other Grade 3 or Grade 4 increases 
in creatinine were reported  
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, mean increases from Baseline in serum creatinine were observed 
throughout the 52 weeks of maintenance treatment for the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups, with 
smaller mean increases observed in the placebo group.  At Week 52 the mean (SD) changes from 
Baseline in serum creatinine for the upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, and placebo groups were 
7.5 (10.87), 6.7 (10.50), and 0.4 (11.79) μmol/L, respectively. No subjects experienced Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 serum creatinine values during maintenance treatment. Grade 2 increases in creatinine were 
reported in 4.6%, 1.3%, and 1.4% of subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, and 
placebo, respectively. In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, 1 event (0.4 E/100 PY) and 3 events (2.2 E/100 
PY) for the TEAEs of renal dysfunction occurred in the upadacitinib 30 mg and placebo groups, 
respectively. No TEAEs of renal dysfunction were reported in the upadacitinib 15 mg group. Two TEAEs 
of renal dysfunction (PT acute kidney injury) were serious: 1 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group and 1 in 
the placebo group. The serious TEAE of acute kidney injury in the upadacitinib 30 mg group was 
severe and considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug The event began on Day 868 of Study M14-430 Substudy 1, lasted 4 days, and was considered a 
complicationof COVID-19 infection. This subject also experienced concurrent rhabdomyolysis. 
Adjudicated GI perforation   
In the upadacitinib CD global Phase 3 studies, subjects with a history of spontaneous GI perforation 
(other than appendicitis or mechanical injury), diverticulitis, or significantly increased risk for GI 
perforation per investigator judgment were excluded.  In the upadacitinib CD Phase 2 studies (Studies 
M14-327 and M13-740) and Phase 3 studies, if a diagnosis of spontaneous GI perforation was 
confirmed (other than appendicitis or mechanical injury), the subject was permanently discontinued 
from study drug. 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, 1 event of GI perforation was reported in a subject on upadacitinib 45 mg. 
Additionally, 3 subjects who received placebo during the placebo-controlled period and did not respond  
to induction treatment experienced the events of GI perforation during the extended treatment period

with upadacitinib 45 mg.  The 4 subjects had active or severe CD at the time of the GI perforation.  All 
events of GI perforation were serious, severe, considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug, and led to discontinuation of study drug. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, 3 adjudicated GI perforations were reported in 1 subject each in the 
placebo (0.7 E/100PYs), upadacitinib 15 mg (0.4 E/100PYs) and upadacitinib 30 mg (0.4 E/100PYs) 
groups. In addition, 4 subjects experienced events of GI perforation while receiving open-label 
upadacitinib 30 mg as rescue therapy during the maintenance period (2 had inadequate response to 
blinded 15 mg, 1 to blinded 30 mg, and one to placebo). 
Overall, in the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, 1 subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg/placebo, 1 
subject in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg, 2 subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg (including 1 
receiving blinded and OL rescue upadacitinib 30 mg), and 5 subjects rescued with OL upadacitinib 30 
mg experienced events of adjudicated GI perforation.  These events occurred when the subjects 
experienced active or severe CD or CD complications (stricture, obstruction) and reflect the higher risk 
of GI perforation in the CD patient population.  
Additionally, 3 subjects experienced adjudicated GI perforations during the Phase 2 studies. 
Patient characteristics of the cases with GI perforation are provided below:  
1.  UPA 45 mg 97 Days Since First Dose of Study Drug, 13 days since first dose of UPA. Intestinal

related to pre-existing CD 
Malignancy 
In the PC_IND/45 IND and EXT_TRT Analysis Set, no TEAE of malignancy, malignancy excluding 
NMSC, NMSC, or lymphoma was reported. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAIR of TEAEs of malignancy excluding NMSC was 0.4 n/100 PY (1 
subject with metastatic ovarian cancer) in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, 1.1 n/100 PY (3 subjects: 1 
subject with adenocarcinoma of colon, 1 subject with invasive lobular breast carcinoma, 1 subject with 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023

pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma) in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, and 0.7 n/100 PY (1 
subject with intraductal proliferative breast lesion reported as breast ductal carcinoma in situ) in the 
placebo group. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, the EAIR of TEAEs of malignancy excluding  NMSC was 0.4 
n/100 PY (1 subject) and 1.2 n/100 PY (6 subjects; after correction of the one NMSC, 1.0 n/100 PY) in 
the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg and upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohorts, respectively. Additionally, 1 
subject (0.5 n/100 PY) in the upadacitinib 45 mg/placebo cohort and 3 subjects (0.8 n/100 PY) in the 
rescue upadacitinib 30 mg cohort experienced malignancy excluding NMSC.  The overall incidence rate 
of malignancy excluding NMSC in the any upadacitinib group was 0.7 n/100 PY. 
In the Phase 2 studies, 2 subjects experienced malignancy excluding NMSC during the maintenance 
treatment with upadacitinib 12 mg BID Overall, the malignancy excluding NMSC was reported slightly 
more frequently in subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg compared to upadacitinib 15 mg.  However, 
the MAH states that based on the limited number and lack of pattern of the malignancy types, an 
increased risk of malignancy excluding NMSC with upadacitinib 30 mg compared to upadacitinib 15 mg 
cannot be concluded. 
Adjudicated MACE 
Table 64 Treatment-Emergent Adjudicated MACE EAER per 100 PY (ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set 
In the PC_IND, 45 IND and EXT_TRT Analysis Sets, no upadacitinib-treated subjects had a TEAE of 
adjudicated MACE. One placebo-treated subject experienced an adjudicated other CV event (transient 
ischemic attack). 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, no adjudicated MACE was reported in the upadacitinib 15 mg, 
upadacitinib 30 mg and placebo groups. In the Phase 3 maintenance/LTE treatment period, 2 events of 
adjudicated MACE (non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI) were reported in 2 subjects receiving 
upadacitinib 30 mg as rescue therapy. The incidence rate of adjudicated MACE was 0.2 n/100 PY in all 
subjects who responded to induction treatment and received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 149/217 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, there were 2 events (acute MI and pneumonia aspiration with abnormal cardiac enzymes) 
adjudicated as MACE reported in the Phase 2 studies. According to the MAH, all subjects with 
adjudicated MACE had at least one CV risk factor, such as hypertension, obesity, smoking history, and 
diabetes. 
Adjudicated VTE:  
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, no subjects receiving upadacitinib had a TEAE of adjudicated VTE.  
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, adjudicated thrombotic events were reported in 2 subjects (1 DVT in 1 
subject and 1 other thrombosis event [PT hepatic vein thrombosis] in 1 subject) receiving upadacitinib 
30 mg compared with no events in those receiving upadacitinib 15 mg or placebo. 
In the Phase 3 clinical studies, a total of 3 subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg during induction and 
upadacitinib 30 mg during maintenance/LTE (0.6 n/100 PY) and 1 subject receiving placebo during 
induction and maintenance/LTE (0.7 n/100 PY) experienced adjudicated VTE.  Additionally, adjudicated 
VTE (both DVT) were reported in 2 subjects (1 with upadacitinib 15 mg and 1 with rescue upadacitinib 
30 mg) during the LTE Phase 2 study Two adjudicated other venous thrombotic events (hepatic vein 
thrombosis with upadacitinib 30 mg and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis with rescue upadacitinib 
30 mg) and 1 adjudicated arterial thrombosis (upadacitinib 30 mg) were reported during the 
maintenance/LTE studies.  
Fractures 
Table 65 TEAEs of Fracture Reported in Subjects in Any Group (PC_IND/45_IND 
Analysis Sets) 
In the 45_IND Analysis Set, 1 subject each (0.1%) in the upadacitinib 45 mg group had a TEAE of 
ankle fracture, femoral neck fracture, fibula fracture, radius fracture, spinal compression fracture and 
wrist fracture; no subjects in the placebo group had a TEAE of fracture. Two of the 6 events (femoral 
neck fracture and spinal compression fracture) were serious.  All 6 events were considered by the 
investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug and did not lead to study 
drug discontinuation. The SAEs of femoral neck fracture and spinal compression fracture occurred in 2 
subjects following accidental falls.  According to the MAH, the 2 subjects also had risk factors including 
medical history of osteoporosis, Cushing's syndrome, or concomitant use of glucocorticoids and of the 
4 subjects with nonserious events of fracture, 1 had an alternative etiology (bike accident), and 3 had 
underlying risk factors, including history of menopause and concomitant medications of methotrexate, 
glucocorticoids, or SSRI or obesity.

In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, 1 subject each (≤ 0.5%) had a TEAE of lower limb fracture and stress 
fracture in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; foot fracture and upper limb fracture in the upadacitinib 30 
mg group; and rib fracture in the placebo group All but one event (stress fracture of the femoral neck) 
were considered non-serious; all 5 events were considered by the investigator to have no reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug and did not lead to study drug discontinuation 
The SAE of stress fracture occurred on Day 393 of treatment in a subject with a history of osteoporosis 
and smoking in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; alternative etiology was reported as accidental fall.The 
remaining 4 non-serious events were reported in 3 male and 1 female subject.  Ages ranged from 30 
to 64 years old.  Event time-to-onset (TTO) ranged from 127 to 872 days  
of upadacitinib treatment. According to the MAH, risk factor of concomitant medications (i.e., PPI) was 
identified in 2 subjects.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of abnormal hematology laboratory values:  hemoglobin, 
neutrophils, and lymphocytes were evaluated and reported in the section for the respective associated 
AESI. According to the MAH, there were no clinically meaningful differences seen for treatment with 
upadacitinib compared with placebo in the placebo-controlled safety analyses for changes in platelet 
counts, for subjects meeting criteria for PCS values for platelet counts, for shift analysis from Baseline 
to post-Baseline in platelet counts, or for TEAEs representing changes in platelet counts.  In long-term 
analyses, similar results were seen with upadacitinib across treatment groups.

Safety in special populations 
The following intrinsic factors were examined:  gender, age, race, geographic region,  
BMI category, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment. 
Gender 
In the PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Set, the rates of TEAEs overall, AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug, and AEs with a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug as assessed by the 
investigator were higher in females compared with males in the upadacitinib 45 mg group, while the 
rates for COVID-19 related AEs, SAE and severe TEAEs were generally similar between the gender 
subgroups. The rates of most AESI were generally similar between males and females, with the 
exception of CPK increases that were slightly higher in males compared to females. In the RESP_MAIN 
Analysis Set, the rates of TEAEs overall were higher in females compared to males across all treatment 
groups. However, according to the MAH no consistent trends were noticed for the rates of other AE 
categories between the gender subgroup 
Age 
PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Sets: Due to the small number of subjects ≥ 65 years age in the placebo 
group (9 subjects), no comparison between upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo was performed. Results 
are being presented for only the 45_IND Analysis Set. A total of 900 subjects were included in the < 
65 years age subgroups, while 38 subjects were included in the ≥ 65 years age group for the 45_IND 
Analysis Set. According to the MAH, there was no consistent trend between age subgroups, except for 
a higher rate of TEAEs overall and TEAEs with a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug as 
assessed by the investigator in the < 65 years age group. Most AESI rates were similar between age 
groups, except for anemia, with a higher rate in the < 65 years age group (7.0%) compared to the ≥ 
65 years age (2.6%), which should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size in the 
elderly subgroup. 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, a small number of subjects was included in the ≥ 65 years age group: 
placebo (N = 8), upadacitinib 15 mg (N = 7), and upadacitinib 30 mg (N = 8). For the placebo and 
upadacitinib 30 mg treatment groups, the rates of SAEs and severe TEAEs were higher in subjects ≥ 65 
years (49.4 E/100PY and 37.0 E/100PY, respectively) compared to subjects < 65 years age (17.0 
E/100PY and 15.4 E/100PY, respectively). For the upadacitinib 15 mg group, most AE categories were 
higher in the < 65 years age, except for the COVID 19-related events.  In the <65 years age 
subgroup, the rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs with a reasonable possibility of 
being related to study drug were lower among upadacitinib-treated subjects compared with placebo-
treated subjects. In the ≥ 65 years age group, the rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, severe TEAEs, and any 
AE with reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were lower among upadacitinib 15 mg-
treated subjects compared to upadacitinib 30 mg-treated and placebo-treated subjects. 
Race 
In the PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Set, the rates of AEs in all categories were generally similar between 
White and non-White subgroups and the percentages of AESI between race subgroups were 
comparable, except for TEAE of anemia and neutropenia, which were higher in the non-White 
Assessment report

subgroup. The rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe 
TEAEs, and TEAEs with a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were similar or 
numerically lower among upadacitinib treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects for 
both White and non-White subjects. 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, there was no consistent pattern or trend observed for the 
rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
between Whites and non-Whites subgroups Similar to what was observed in the RESP_MAIN Analysis 
Set, the EAERs of TEAEs of neutropenia, lymphopenia and hepatic disorder were higher in non-White 
subjects compared to Whites subjects for most treatment groups. 
Geographic Region 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the rates for AE categories were generally similar between geographic 
region subgroups. Within both the NA and ROW subgroups, the rates of most AESI were similar 
between the geographic region subgroups, except for anemia, which was higher in the ROW (8.1%) 
compared to the NA subgroup (4.5%) in the upadacitinib 45 mg group. In the RESP_MAIN Analysis 
Set, and across treatment groups, there was no consistent pattern or trend observed for rates of SAEs, 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs with a reasonable possibility 
of being related to study drug between NA and ROW. The rates of TEAEs overall were numerically 
higher in NA compared with ROW subjects across treatment groups In the NA subgroup, the rates of 
TEAEs overall and SAEs were lower in upadacitinib 15 mg-treated subjects compared to placebo-
treated subjects, and the rate of severe TEAEs was lower among upadacitinib-treated subjects (15 mg 
and 30 mg) compared with placebo-treated subjects. Among the ROW subgroup, the rates of SAEs and 
TEAEs with reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were lower in upadacitinib 30 mg 
treated subjects than in the other groups, and the rates of TEAEs overall were lower among 
upadacitinib-treated (15 mg and 30 mg), compared to placebo-treated subjects the rates of most AESI 
were generally similar among geographic region subgroups. The EAERs of TEAEs of herpes zoster and 
lymphopenia were higher in ROW subjects across all treatment groups, while the rates for anemia 
were higher than in NA subjects in the placebo and upadacitinib 15 mg treatment groups. 
BMI Category 
Most subjects were non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2) at Baseline; thus, the sample size for obese subjects 
was smaller compared with non-obese subjects and therefore results should be interpreted with 
caution. 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the rates for AE categories were generally similar between BMI subgroups. 
The rates of most AESI were similar between obese and non-obese subjects.  For the upadacitinib 45 
mg treatment group, a higher percentage of anemia was noticed in non-obese compared to obese 
subjects (8.3% vs. 2.7%, respectively); while the percentage for CPK elevation was higher in obese  
compared to non-obese subgroup (7.2% vs 2.1%, respectively) In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis 
Set, the rates of SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs with a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were generally similar between BMI subgroups.  
The rates of TEAEs overall and COVID-19 related events were numerically higher in the obese subjects 
compared to non-obese ones. 
Renal Impairment 
In the upadacitinib clinical studies, subjects with estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate < 30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded. Most subjects had normal renal function or mild impairment at 
Baseline; thus, the sample size for the moderate renal impairment subgroup was smaller compared 
with the other 2 subgroups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 153/217 
 
 
 
 
In the PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Sets, the rates for AEs categories were generally similar among renal 
function subgroups. The rates of most AESI were similar among the subgroups. In the RESP_MAIN 
Analysis Set, the rates of TEAEs overall were numerically higher in the normal renal function subjects, 
across all treatment groups. The rates of COVID-19-related events and severe TEAEs were higher than 
normal renal subjects in the mild renal impairment subjects for the upadacitinib 15 mg treatment 
group. Among the mild renal impairment subjects, rates of TEAEs overall were lower among 
upadacitinib 30 mg-treated subjects compared with placebo treated subjects. Among the impairment 
subjects, rates of TEAEs overall, SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe TEAEs, 
and TEAEs with reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were similar in upadacitinib-
treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects In the mild renal impairment subgroup, the EAERs of 
COVID 19-related infections were similar between the placebo and upadacitinib 30 mg groups, and 
higher in upadacitinib 15 mg-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects. Across the no 
renal impairment subjects, the EAERs of COVID 19-related infections were similar between 
upadacitinib-treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects. No AEs led to death and no deaths 
occurred among subjects with no renal impairment, mild renal impairment, or moderate renal 
impairment. In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, most of the rates of AESI were comparable among renal 
function subgroups. In the upadacitinib 15 mg treatment group, the rates of TEAEs of neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, CPK elevation and hepatic disorder were higher in subjects with no renal impairment, 
while the rates of serious infections and herpes zoster were higher in the mild renal impairment 
subgroup. In the upadacitinib 30 mg group, the rates of lymphopenia were higher in subjects with no 
renal impairment, while the rates of serious infection and hepatic disorder were higher in the mild 
renal impairment subgroup. In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, most rates of TEAEs overall, 
SAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and TEAEs with a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug were numerically higher in subjects with normal renal 
function, but still comparable to the other renal function subgroups 
Hepatic Impairment 
Most subjects had normal hepatic function at Baseline; few subjects had mild ormoderate hepatic 
impairment and no subjects had severe hepatic impairment. Only results from subjects with normal or 
mild hepatic function are presented.In the PC_IND/45_IND Analysis Sets, the rates for AE categories 
were generally similar among hepatic function subgroups, except for the rates of SAEs, which were 
higher in subjects with normal hepatic function, and TEAEs overall and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug, which were higher in the mild hepatic impairment subgroup The rates of 
most AESI were similar between the subgroups, except for the percentages of herpes zoster, 
neutropenia, CPK elevation, and hepatic disorder, which were higher in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment. In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, there was no consistent pattern or trend for the rates of 
AEs categories between the hepatic function subgroups. For the upadacitinib 15 mg treatment group, 
the rates of TEAEs overall and SAEs were higher in subjects with normal hepatic function, while the 
rates of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs with a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug were higher in the mild hepatic impairment subgroup. For the 
upadacitinib 30 mg treatment group, the rates of COVID 19-related events, SAEs, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug, and severe TEAEs were higher in subjects with normal hepatic function, 
while the rates of TEAEs overall and TEAEs with a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug 
were higher in the mild hepatic impairment subgroup 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, there was no pattern or trend in the rates of TEAEs overall in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to the normal and moderate impairment subgroups. 
For the other AE categories, there was no pattern or trend of the rates between the subgroups

The following extrinsic factors were examined:  prior biologic response status, number of  
prior biologics used, Baseline steroid use, and Baseline immunomodulator use (integrated  
long-term analysis sets only). 
Prior Biologic Response Status 
In the PC_IND and 45_IND Analysis Sets, the percentages of subjects with TEAEs  
overall and by individual AE category were higher in Bio-IR subjects compared with non- 
Bio-IR subjects. The percentages of subjects with AESI were generally comparable between Bio-IR and 
non-Bio-IR subjects.  The percentage of subjects with serious infections was higher in Bio-IR subjects 
than non-Bio-IR subjects, whereas the opposite was observed for subjects with anemia and  
neutropenia. Across the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set and across treatment groups, there was no  
consistent pattern or trend observed for the rates of SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs  
leading to discontinuation of study drug between Bio-IR and non-Bio-IR subjects.  The rates of TEAEs 
overall were higher in Bio-IR compared with non-Bio-IR subjects across upadacitinib treatment groups 
in theIn conclusion, the safety profile was generally similar between non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR  
subjects. 
Number of Prior Biologics 
In the PC_IND and 45_IND Analysis Sets, the percentages of subjects with TEAEs  
overall and by individual AE category were higher in subjects who received > 1 prior  
biologic compared to those who received ≤ 1 prior biologic, except for TEAE leading to  
discontinuation of study drug, which was comparable between groups 
In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the rates of TEAEs overall were numerically higher in  
the subjects who received > 1 prior biologic compared to those who received ≤ 1 prior  
biologic across the upadacitinib treatment groups.  However, the rates for the other  
individual AE categories were comparable between the subgroups 
Baseline Steroid Use 
In the PC_IND and 45_IND Analysis Sets, the percentages of subjects with TEAEs  
overall, SAEs and severe AEs were higher between subjects who used steroids at Baseline  
than those who did not. Across the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set and ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set and  
across upadacitinib-treated subjects TEAEs were higher overall in steroid users compared  
to non-users.  Additionally, SAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and  
severe TEAEs were generally higher in steroid users 
Baseline Immunomodulator Use 
The number of subjects who used immunomodulators at Baseline was substantially smaller (16 
subjects on placebo, 37 subjects on upadacitinib 45 mg [PC_IND], and 50 subjects on upadacitinib 45 
mg [45_IND]) compared with the number of subjects who did not use immunomodulators at Baseline 
(331 subjects on placebo, 637 subjects on upadacitinib 45 mg [PC_IND], and 888 subjects on 
upadacitinib 45 mg. In the PC_IND and 45_IND Analysis Sets, the percentages of subjects with TEAEs  
overall and by individual AE category were higher in subjects who used immunomodulators at Baseline 
than those who did not, except for TEAEs with a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug 
as assessed by the investigator

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
According to the MAH the potential for drug-drug interactions between upadacitinib and commonly 
used concomitant medications as well as probe substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was 
characterized in several Phase 1 studies. Based on the results of these studies, strong inducers of 
CYP3A (e.g., rifampin) reduce upadacitinib plasma exposures by approximately half while strong 
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increase upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve by 
75% and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) by 70%.  Concomitant administration of strong 
CYP2D6 inhibitors, OATP1B inhibitors, MTX, pH modifying medications, or statins have no effect on 
upadacitinib plasma exposures.  Upadacitinib has no clinically relevant effects on plasma exposures of 
MTX, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, statins, or drugs that are substrates for metabolism by CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP3A. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the PC_IND Analysis Set, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to  
discontinuation of study drug was 4.9% in the upadacitinib 45 mg and 5.5% in the placebo group.  
Individual TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in no more than 1 subject in 
any group, except for worsening CD (11 [3.2%] subjects in the placebo group and 8 [1.2%] subjects 
in the upadacitinib 45 mg group) and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, herpes zoster, and paraesthesia 
(2 [0.3%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 mg group).   
In the EXT_TRT Analysis Set, 11 (7.7%) subjects discontinued upadacitinib during the 24-week 
treatment period due to a TEAE; most discontinuations resulted from the TEAE of worsening of CD.  
The remaining discontinuations were due to the following TEAEs (1 subject each):  leukopenia, 
abdominal abscess, and acute kidney injury.   
Assessment report

In the RESP_MAIN Analysis Set, the EAER of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 
highest in the upadacitinib 15 mg group (9.3 E/100 PY), followed by the placebo group (8.0 E/100 PY) 
and the upadacitinib 30 mg group (6.5 E/100 PY).  The TEAEs by PT leading to discontinuation of study 
drug were reported no more than once in any group, except for worsening of CD (5 events in the 
placebo group, 5 events in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, 2 events in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) 
and acne (2 events in the upadacitinib 30 mg group). 
In the ALL_TRT_RESP[subj] Analysis Set, the EAERs of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
were slightly higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort (8.9 E/100 PY) compared to the 
upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort (7.6 E/100 PY). The TEAEs by PT leading to discontinuation of study 
drug were reported no more than once in either of these 2 cohorts, except for worsening of CD (5 
events in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg and 9 events in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohorts) and 
anaemia, anal fistula, lung opacity, and acne (2 events each in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort). 
In subjects who received upadacitinib 30 mg as rescue medication and in subjects who were exposed 
to any dose of upadacitinib, the EAERs of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 11.5 
E/100 PY and 9.0 E/100 PY, respectively. 
Post marketing experience 
Upadacitinib 15 mg daily dose was first approved for the treatment of RA on 16 August 2019 
(international birth date) in the US.  Upadacitinib has been approved in RA in over 60 countries and 
was approved for treatment of PsA and AS in the EU on 25 January 2021 and in additional countries.  
Upadacitinib was also approved for the treatment of UC in the US on 16 March 2022.  Upadacitinib (30 
mg or 15 mg QD) was approved in the EU on 23 August 2021 and other countries for the treatment of 
adults and adolescents with AD. Through 30 June 2021, the estimated cumulative postmarketing 
exposure is 88,004 patient treatment years.  AbbVie has been continuing to monitor potential new 
safety signals through its ongoing routine pharmacovigilance that includes weekly review of all 
postmarketing reports, serious and nonserious, received from all sources (including literature) and 
SAEs from clinical trials; quarterly review of data mining scores generated from the FDA's Adverse 
Event Reporting System database; and periodic reports (Periodic Safety Update Report, Development 
Safety Update Report, periodic adverse drug experience reports, etc.) with assessment of topics of 
interest, per mandated timelines, and postmarketing studies The overall safety of upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD therapy was evaluated through review of postmarketing reports (spontaneous, solicited, literature) 
received from 16 August 2019 through 22 April 2022.  Search of the AbbVie global safety database 
retrieved 79,424 reports, which include 9,030 serious reports and 70,394 nonserious reports.  Of the 
70,394 nonserious reports, 95% (66,794 reports) were from solicited sources. 
Review of the postmarketing safety data reported for upadacitinib to date demonstrated a similar 
safety profile as observed in the clinical studies for RA.  The 79,424 cumulative postmarketing reports 
describe 182,601 events (13,759 serious and 168,842 nonserious). Of the 168,842 nonserious events, 
the most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC of general disorders and administration site 
conditions and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.  The most common reported AEs 
include pain (5%), arthralgia (4.46%), RA (4.33%), drug ineffective (3.23%) and pain in extremity 
(2.90%).  Most of the postmarketing events are either expected for upadacitinib or commonly seen in 
the general population or patients with RA.  Although drug ineffective is listed as one of the most 
frequently reported events, it is also not unexpected for a product once reaching market. Of the 
13,759 serious events, the most frequently reported SAEs were in the SOCs of infections and 
infestations, surgical and medical procedures, general disorders and administration site conditions, and 
eye disorders. The most common reported SAEs by PT include COVID-19, surgery, hospitalization 
(2.53%), and pneumonia (2.50%); and death, knee arthroplasty, and cataract (1.58% each).  The 
Assessment report

reports of COVID-19 infection were reflective of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the review 
period.  Surgery, hospitalization, and knee arthroplasty are not unexpected in patients with RA.  
Pneumonia is a labeled event for upadacitinib.  Reports with the generic PT Death described older 
patients (median age 58 years) with RA as the top indication (83%) and contained limited events 
details.  Of the cataract reports, review of the available information provided that most of the patients 
were elderly (average age 66 years), which is a patient population with high prevalence and incidence 
of cataract.  Additionally, many of these patients with cataracts were also on concomitant medications, 
such as steroids, which are known to cause cataract.  Thus, excluding COVID-19, the type and pattern 
of SAEs reported were similar to what has been observed in the RA clinical trials for upadacitinib or 
expected for the patient populations indicated for upadacitinib or the general population. Although 
many of the postmarketing reports did not provide sufficient information to allow for an adequate 
assessment, review of the available data did not suggest any unusual findings on mortality, 
malignancy, and CV events including MACE and VTE.  Besides the underlying medical condition, 
generally, the patients had at least 1 other risk factor observed for the development of these events 
while receiving upadacitinib. 
According to the MAH, analysis of the safety data available from the postmarketing experience has not 
confirmed any new clinically important safety risks for upadacitinib. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Rinvoq was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in December 2019, and 
subsequently for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) atopic dermatitis 
(AD) and recently (May 2022) for Ulcerative Colitis (UC). In UC, the induction dose is 45 mg for 8 
weeks (with the option to prolong induction for additional 8 weeks for inadequate responders) followed 
by 15 or 30 mg as maintenance treatment. The proposed dose for the current indication Crohn disease 
(CD) is 45 mg as induction treatment for 12 weeks, followed by 15 mg or 30 mg as maintenance 
treatment. Thus, the proposed dosing regimen is similar, but not identical as the dose given for UC. 
The main difference is the proposed extended treatment, where patients with an insufficient response 
at week 12 are suggested to receive a lower dose (30 mg) for additional 12 weeks. After 24 weeks, it 
is suggested to stop treatment if no effect is seen. See discussion in 2.4.3.  
The upadacitinib CD global clinical development program consists of a Phase 2 induction and 
maintenance study (Study M13-740), a Phase 2 OLE study (Study M14-327), two Phase 3 induction 
studies (Study M14-431 and Study M14-433), a Phase 3 maintenance study (Study M14-430 Substudy 
1), and a LTE study (Study M14-430 Substudy 2).  
In the upadacitinib CD global Phase 3 studies, the short and long-term safety profile of upadacitinib is 
supported by data from 833 subjects who received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib and at least 1 dose 
of study drug during maintenance/LTE.  This group of subjects had a mean duration of 75.4 weeks.  Of 
these subjects, 536 (64.3%) and 244 (29.3%) had exposure to upadacitinib for at least 1 year and 2 
years, respectively. 
The main safety analysis sets are the following: 
• 
Placebo-Controlled Induction (PC_IND):  Includes all Phase 3 treated subjects randomized to 
Placebo or UPA 45 mg QD during the 12-week placebo-controlled induction period.  
•  Extended Treatment Period (EXT_TRT): Includes all Phase 3 treated subjects who received 
randomized or open-label UPA 45 mg QD during induction and received UPA 30 mg QD during  
extended treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 158/217 
 
 
 
 
•  Randomized Responders Maintenance (RESP_MAIN): Includes all Phase 3 treated UPA 45 mg 
induction responders who were re-randomized to receive placebo, UPA 15 mg QD, or UPA 30 
mg QD during maintenance.  Data from the first dose of maintenance through the last dose of 
maintenance or long-term-extension prior to rescue administration of OL UPA 30 mg QD are 
included in this analysis set  
•  All Treated Responders by Subject (ALL_TRT_RESP[subj]): Includes all Phase 3 treated 
subjects who received study drug during induction and in maintenance or LTE.  Data from the 
first dose of induction through the end of maintenance or long-term-extension are included.  
Treatment cohorts for subject are defined as: 
o  PBO / PBO – received placebo during induction and maintenance/LTE; data after rescue 
are excluded from this cohort and reported in the RESC UPA 30 mg cohort; 
o  UPA 45 mg / PBO – received 45 mg during induction or extended treatment and 
randomized to placebo in maintenance; data after rescue are excluded from this cohort 
and reported in the RESC UPA 30 mg cohort; 
o  UPA 45 mg / 15 mg – received 45 mg during induction or extended treatment and 
randomized to 15 mg in maintenance; data after rescue are excluded from this cohort 
and reported in the RESC UPA 30 mg cohort; 
o  UPA 45 mg / 30 mg – received 45 mg during induction or extended treatment and 
randomized or assigned 30 mg in maintenance/LTE; data after rescue are not excluded 
(as the dose did not change); 
o  RESC UPA 30 mg – received OL rescue UPA 30 mg after previously receiving placebo or 
UPA 15 mg; only includes data from the first dose of rescue medication through the 
end of LTE. 
o  Any UPA[Resp] – Any subjects who responded to the induction treatment (placebo or 
upadacitinib) and received at least one maintenance dose of upadacitinib 
Overview of adverse events 
During the placebo-controlled 12-week induction period, the frequency of adverse events (AEs) was 
62.2% in the placebo group and 65.1% in the UPA group. SAEs occurred in 8.4% in the placebo group 
and 8.0 % in the UPA group. The frequency of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was higher 
in the placebo group (5.5% vs 4.9%). There were no deaths in either group during the induction 
period. In the extended treatment group, the EAERs of SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug were higher than the rates observed during the initial 12 weeks of 
induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg. One death, due to Covid infection occurred during the 
extended treatment phase. In the maintenance period, the EAERs of TEAEs overall, SAEs, and severe 
TEAEs were higher in the placebo group compared with both upadacitinib treatment groups. 
Common adverse events 
Common adverse events in the CD studies were in line with previous known AEs. In the induction 
phase the most frequently reported TEAEs were acne, nasopharyngitis, anaemia, and headache in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group. In the maintenance phase, the EAERs of TEAEs reported at ≥ 5 E/100 PY in 
the placebo group were generally higher than or similar to those in the upadacitinib groups; exceptions 
included COVID-19 in both upadacitinib groups and upper respiratory tract infection in the upadacitinib 
30 mg group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 159/217 
 
 
 
 
No new ADRs were suggested for inclusion in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC by the MAH. However, 
pneumonia were more common (>1%) in both maintenance doses of upadacitinib in the CD studies 
than previous reported and thus, the MAH proposed to update pneumonia from uncommon to common 
in the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. The reason for the higher prevalence of 
pneumonia in the CD studies are not fully clarified but may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In addition, the following statement regarding the frequencies of most commonly AEs was proposed in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC (added text in bold): 
“In the placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease induction and maintenance clinical 
trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥3% of patients) with upadacitinib 45 mg, 30 mg or 
15 mg were upper respiratory tract infection (19.9%), pyrexia (8.7%), blood CPK increased (7.6%), 
anemia (7.4%), headache (6.6%), acne (6.3%), neutropaenia (6.0%), rash (5.2%), herpes zoster (6.1%), 
blood CPK increased (4.1%), pneumonia (4.1%), hypercholesterolemia (4.0%), bronchitis (3.9%), 
aspartate transaminase increased (3.9%), fatigue (3.9%), alanine transaminase increased (3.5%), 
folliculitis (3.6%), herpes simplex (3.2%), and influenza (3.2%).”  
The frequencies are the highest frequencies observed in the induction or maintenance phases for the 
UPA 15 mg, UPA 30 mg or UPA 45 mg dose in the CD studies. Hence, this proposal was acceptable to 
CHMP. 
Upon CHMP request, the MAH included a brief description of selected events, including GI perforation, 
in the CD population also under the heading “Description of selected adverse reactions” in the Section 
4.8 of the SmPC (see further discussion below). 
Deaths and serious adverse events 
Three deaths were reported in the Phase 3 CD clinical program and on additional death was reported in 
the phase 2 program. Two deaths, one due to septic shock and one due to postoperative complication, 
also with sepsis, occurred >150 days after discontinuing UPA and it is agreed with the MAH that these 
events are unlikely to be related to UPA because of the long time to onset from last dose. The other 
two deaths were related to Covid infection; One treatment-emergent death due to COVID-19 was 
reported for a subject receiving upadacitinib 30 mg during extended treatment and one treatment-
emergent death due to COVID-19 pneumonia was reported for a subject who received rescue with 
upadacitinib 30 mg during long-term treatment. All 4 fatal events were considered by the investigator 
as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. However, for the two COVID-19 
cases it could not be ruled out that UPA contributed to these events. There is already a statement in 
the Section 4.4 of the SmPC that serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients 
receiving upadacitinib and no additional update is deemed necessary. 
SAEs reported in more than 1 subject were worsening of CD (UPA 2.1%, Placebo 4.3%), GI 
haemorrhage and intestinal obstruction (3 [0.4%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 mg group), anal 
abscess (3 [0.4%] subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group and 3 [0.9%] subjects in the placebo 
group); and abdominal pain, ileus, and nephrolithiasis (2 [0.3%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 45 
mg group). In the extended treatment group (patients that did not respond on 45 mg UPA after 12 
week treatment and continued to receive 30 mg UPA OL for additional 12 weeks) the EAERs for the 
most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg group through Week 
24 were generally similar to rates reported during the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg 
treatment; except higher rates of worsening of CD, influenza and herpes zoster. The EAERs of SAEs, 
severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were however higher than the rates 
observed during the initial 12 weeks of induction treatment.  The EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs 
increased with longer duration of exposure to upadacitinib, primarily driven by worsening of CD (64.5 
E/100 PY through Week 24 compared with 51.8 E/100 PY during the initial 12 weeks of treatment). 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 160/217 
 
 
 
 
Upon CHMP request, the MAH provided additional information regarding 122 patients (excluding the 
patient that initially received placebo for 12 weeks) There were no major differences in safety profiles 
between the 12-week induction with upadacitinib 45 mg and the 24-week treatment with upadacitinib 
45 mg/30 mg, with the exception of overall SAEs (primarily driven by worsening of CD in 7 patients). 
Further, there were no GI perforations during the extended treatment for the 122 subjects receiving 
extended treatment 30mg QD after 45 mg QD induction treatment. This is reassuring and the proposal 
for extended induction treatment was considered acceptable. See further discussion in Section 2.4.3.  
Adverse events of special interest 
During the induction phase, the percentage of subjects with serious infections was similar in subjects 
receiving upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo (1.9% and 1.7%, respectively). The most commonly 
reported serious infections were of gastrointestinal infections. The only serious infections by PT 
reported in ≥ 1 subject in any group was anal abscess reported in 3 patients in both treatment groups. 
Also in patients who were non responders at week 12 and received extended treatment, the EAER of 
serious infections (19.4 E/100 PY) was similar to the rate reported during the initial 12 weeks of 
induction treatment (21.3 E/100 PY). During the maintenance phase, the EAERs of TEAEs of serious 
infections were higher in the placebo group (7.2 E/100PY) compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg 
group (4.0 E/100PY) and upadacitinib 30 mg group (5.7 E/100PY). The event rates of serious 
infections were slightly higher with progression of time for the upadacitinib 30 mg cohorts, but the 
types of serious infections observed were consistent with those anticipated in patients with moderately 
to severely active CD (e.g., intra-abdominal abscess), reflective of the COVID-19 pandemic, or 
expected for upadacitinib. No new safety signals were observed, and serious infection is adequately 
addressed in Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. A paragraph on serious infections occurring 
during the treatment of CD was included in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No events of active TB were reported in the studies. There is a recommendation in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC to screen for TB before start of Rinvoq treatment. This is acceptable. 
Opportunistic infections (excluding TB and herpes zoster) occurred in three subjects during the 
induction or extended treatment period and three additional infections occurred  during 
maintenance/LT. Opportunistic infections are an identified risk of upadacitinib treatment and are 
described in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Herpes zoster was reported in 20 subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg as induction treatment, while 
no event of herpes zoster was reported in subjects receiving placebo. During maintenance treatment, 
higher rates of herpes zoster were observed with upadacitinib 30 mg compared with upadacitinib 15 
mg and placebo. The majority of herpes zoster events were cutaneous (generally 1 dermatome or 2 
dermatomes on the same side), with cases involving 3 or more dermatomes reported in 12.9% of 
subjects in the any upadacitinib treatment cohort. Four subjects experienced events with ophthalmic 
involvement. Herpes zoster is a well-known common AE regarding UPA treatment and a class effect for 
JAK inhibitors and adequately described in the SmPC. No updates are deemed necessary.  
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor therapy has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal 
perforations and given upadacitinib's effects on the IL-6 signalling pathway, GI perforation is 
considered an AESI and was included in the RMP as an important potential risk. In previous studies of 
upadacitinib, events of diverticulitis have been reported and included as uncommon in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. In addition, a warning regarding diverticulitis as risk factor for GI perforation is included in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC. According to the MAH, based on the long-term data as of 15 August 2021, 
the incidence rates of GI perforation were ≤ 0.1 E/100 PY in both RA and PsA studies with upadacitinib 
15 mg, and 0.2 E/100 PY in RA and 0 E/100 PY in PsA with upadacitinib 30 mg. No events of GI

perforation were reported in the AS and AD clinical programs. In the UC studies of upadacitinib, no 
events of GI perforation were reported during the induction treatment, but one single event of GI 
perforation was reported in a subject while on upadacitinib 15 mg during the long-term extension 
period. In the CD studies, 14 patients experienced GI perforation, which is the highest amount across 
indications. In almost all cases, the event led to discontinuation of UPA. According to the MAH, the 
patients had severe active CD, strictures or other signs of severe disease. The event occurred in 4 
patients receiving UPA during induction treatment but in none of the placebo patients at induction and 
in several patients receiving rescue treatment in the maintenance phase. It could be agreed that CD 
patients have a higher risk of GI perforations than for example UC patients, and the findings may 
reflect this. Although it could not be ruled out that the GI-perforation events occurred because of lack 
of efficacy of UPA, there could be an association with UPA treatment. Indeed, all but one event 
occurred in patients on UPA-treatment, some patients with a higher risk of perforation were excluded 
from the study and there is a biological plausible reason why this event could be associated with the 
treatment. Hence, at CHMP’s request, the MAH has included GI perforation as an uncommon ADR in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC and also included a description of the findings in the clinical studies under the 
heading “Description of selected adverse reactions” in the same section. In addition, Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC has been updated to includes a reference to Section 4.8 and information that patients with 
active Crohn´s disease are at increased risk for developing GI-perforation. Finally, section 5.1 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include information that patients with symptomatic bowel strictures were 
excluded from the studies. The Annex II.D Guide for healthcare professionals and patient card have 
been updated accordingly. GI perforation was changed to an Important identified risks in the RMP (see 
2.6. ) 
Additional information regarding patients with severe disease was requested to further explore this 
topic and the results showed that there is a clear benefit with UPA treatment also for patients with a 
high disease activity (CDAI >300) and stricturing/stenosing disease and no new safety problems were 
seen in these subgroups. 
Malignancy 
No TEAE of malignancy, malignancy excluding NMSC, NMSC, or lymphoma was reported in the 
induction phase. During maintenance and long term follow up the EAIR of TEAEs of malignancy 
excluding NMSC was 0.4 n/100 PY (1 subject with metastatic ovarian cancer) in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
group, 1.1 n/100 PY (3 subjects: 1 subject with adenocarcinoma of colon, 1 subject with invasive 
lobular breast carcinoma, 1 subject with pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma) in the 
upadacitinib 30 mg group, and 0.7 n/100 PY (1 subject with intraductal proliferative breast lesion 
reported as breast ductal carcinoma in situ) in the placebo group. As noticed previously for other 
indications, there is a concern regarding dose-dependent increase in EAIR; however, the numbers of 
malignancies were few and no specific pattern in type of malignancies are reported in this development 
program. 
MACE 
There were no cases of MACE reported in the induction Phase or in the  UPA 15 mg group. Two (2) 
events occurred in the rescue group ((non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI). Additionally, there were 2 
events (acute MI and pneumonia aspiration with abnormal cardiac enzymes) adjudicated as MACE 
reported in the Phase 2 studies. According to the MAH, all subjects with adjudicated MACE had at least 
one CV risk factor, such as hypertension, obesity, smoking history, and diabetes. A dose-dependency 
is observed; however, the total number of cases are few which hampers firm conclusions. The risk of 
MACE is already adequately addressed in the SmPC; no update was deemed necessary based on the 
information submitted as part of this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 162/217 
 
 
 
 
VTE 
During the induction phase, there were no VTE case reported in the CD studies. However, during the 
maintenance, adjudicated VTE was reported in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort with an incidence 
rate of VTE of 0.6 n/100 PY, and none was reported in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort.  Two 
subjects treated with upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg experienced adjudicated DVT and 1 subject treated 
with upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg experienced DVT and PE. Additionally, one adjudicated VTE (DVT, 0.7 
n/100 PY) was reported in a subject who received placebo during both the induction and maintenance 
treatment periods. Based on this information, no update of the SmPC was deemed required.  
Laboratory findings 
In the CD studies, ALT and AST elevation was one of the most commonly reported AEs, occurring in 
≥3% of patients. Hence, it was included in the description of commonly reported events for CD in the 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request. During induction treatment, ≤ 1.0% of subjects 
receiving upadacitinib 45 mg experienced an ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN.  During maintenance treatment, 
ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN were uncommon in subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg and were 
slightly higher in the upadacitinib 15 mg group.  Treatment-emergent adverse events of hepatic 
disorder were primarily mild or moderate elevations in transaminases; no events were serious and 
discontinuation of study drug due to hepatic disorder was uncommon. All biochemical Hy's law cases 
were identified to have alternate etiologies that accounted for the increased ALT/AST and TBL.  Both 
ALT and AST elevation are included in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC as common AEs.  In addition, a 
monitoring guidance, although not very specific, regarding hepatic transaminases is included in Section 
4.2 of the SmPC. No updates are needed necessary in those sections based on the finding in the 
current studies. 
Anaemia is a known AE for upadacitinib, listed as a common adverse reaction in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Monitoring recommendation and dose interruption recommendations are already included in the 
Section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. In the induction phase of the CD studies, the percentage of subjects 
with TEAEs of anaemia was numerically higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (7.4%) compared with 
the placebo group (5.5%). According to the MAH decreases in haemoglobin from baseline occurred 
over the first 12 to 24 weeks of upadacitinib treatment but mean changes from baseline were generally 
stabilized around the baseline level with continued treatment. However, as pointed out by the MAH, 
anaemia is also a common complication of CD, which occurs more frequently in patients with CD than 
in patients with UC. Anemia is included in the summary of safety profile in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
A decrease in neutrophil levels was observed during the first 4 weeks of the study, and  
subsequently stabilized with fluctuations over the long-term treatment. The percentage of subjects 
with TEAEs of neutropenia was higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg group (2.1%) compared with the 
placebo group (0.3%). All TEAEs of neutropenia were mild or moderate in severity and no subjects 
discontinued study drug due to a TEAE of neutropenia. Neutropenia is a known risk with Rinvoq 
treatment, and no updates of the SmPC are considered needed.  
Fractures 
Fractures is included as a potential risk in the RMP of UPA. In the clinical CD studies, numerically more 
fractures were seen in patients treated with UPA than placebo, but since the information provided only 
lists the different fractured bone separately, and no information regarding the total amount of fractures 
are displayed, the analysed data is difficult to interpret. Thus, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH 
performed a comprehensive analysis of fractures reported in the Crohn's disease (CD) program and 
other indication programs for upadacitinib. The EAER of fractures was 2.9 E/100 PY during the 
induction phase in the CD program. All cases (6) occurred in the UPA treated group; however, all 6 
cases were assessed as having no relation to study drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 163/217 
 
 
 
 
In the maintenance phase, with treatment duration up to 52 weeks, the EAERs of TEAEs of fractures 
were similar in the upadacitinib 15 mg (0.9 E/100 PY) and 30 mg (0.8 E/100 PY) groups compared 
with the placebo group (0.7 E/PY.)  In the overall population ever treated with UPA, 18 events were 
seen (1.5 E/100 PY). The overall exposure-adjusted long-term event rates of fracture by indication was 
highest in patients with RA and lowest in patients with CD. The fracture data from the CD clinical 
program do not alter the overall assessment of the risk of fracture with upadacitinib. No label update 
for fracture is warranted but fracture will remain as an important potential risk for upadacitinib. The 
MAH will continue to gather additional data to characterize fractures in on-going clinical trials, long-
term post-authorization safety studies, and post marketing data. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
The MAH has updated the RMP with the long-Term Safety Study of Upadacitinib Use in UC and CD 
Patients in Europe. The main objectives of the study are to: 
- To describe and compare the incidence of the safety outcome GI perforation, and to describe and 
compare, where possible, the incidence of fractures and DILI, in adult individuals with UC or CD 
treated with upadacitinib, relative to those treated with biological drug therapies at a similar line of 
therapy (primary objectives). 
- To describe and, where possible, to compare the incidence of the following safety outcomes in adult 
individuals with UC or CD treated with upadacitinib, relative to those treated with biological drug 
therapies at a similar line of therapy for UC and CD in the course of routine clinical care:  malignancy 
(excluding NMSC), NMSC, MACE, VTE, serious infections (defined as all infections that require 
hospitalization, including opportunistic infections), herpes zoster, active TB, and all-cause mortality 
(secondary objectives). 
- To describe the incidence of the above clinical events by dosing pattern (45 mg induction followed by 
15 mg and/or 30 mg maintenance dosing), in very elderly patients (aged ≥ 75 years), in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, in patients with severe renal impairment, and in patients with chronic 
HBV or HCV infection. 
See RMP (2.6. ) for complete description.  
Special populations 
No new safety information occurred in this study. Dose adjustments for older patients and patients 
with severe kidney disease in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC are in line with the recommended 
adjustments for UC. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety findings from the CD studies are in general line with the known safety profile of upadacitinib 
in other indications, including UC.  
At CHMP’s request, the MAH has included GI perforation as an uncommon ADR in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. In addition, Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include information that patients with 
active Crohn´s disease are at increased risk for developing GI-perforation. Finally, section 5.1 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include information that patients with symptomatic bowel strictures were 
excluded from the studies. The Annex II.D Guide for healthcare professionals and patient card have 
been updated accordingly. 
The product information and the RMP (see Section 2.6. ) have been updated in line with the safety 
findings from the studies in Crohn’s disease. Overall, the new indication is acceptable from a safety 
perspective.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to gastrointestinal perforation has been added 
to the product information. The Annex II.D Guide for healthcare professionals and patient card have 
been updated accordingly. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 202/217 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH also took this opportunity to correct some figures in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH will make corrections to some of the translations as part of the linguistic review: 
the updates are generally either grammatical corrections, QRD alignments or correction to align with 
the EN text. The Romanian (RO), French(FR), Danish(DA), Italian(IT), Czech(CS), Polish(PL), 
Norwegian (NO), Portuguese (PT), Latvian(LV) and Bulgarian (BG) translations are affected. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The parent Rinvoq and daughter Rinvoq leaflet are very similar. The additional indication wording in 
the daughter leaflet impacts sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 in parts, although much of the original text is the 
same. All of the new text has been written in the same style as the existing indications/strengths in 
the parent text using simple/plain English. The use of bullets to clearly show there are 6 indications 
also helps to keep the text clear for the reader and sub-headings to guide the reader to the correct 
information for them also work to ensure that patient understanding will not be impacted by the new 
indication. Although in some instances the wording in all sections was changed during the MAA review 
after the initial user testing was completed, we do not believe that this in any way impacted patient 
readability. In addition, the layout and design are almost identical between the parent blister / bottle 
leaflets and the daughter blister / bottle leaflets, with the only changes being intentional to help locate 
information which is indication specific The additional indication wording is not considered to impact 
the readability of the leaflet and would not impact the key safety messages being found in the leaflet 
and therefore no further readability testing is warranted. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease manifested by focal asymmetric, transmural, 
inflammation affecting any segment of the gastrointestinal tract that leads to symptoms, often 
debilitating, of prolonged diarrhoea with or without gross blood, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, 
fever, anaemia and also extra-intestinal manifestations. Due to transmural inflammation, fistula 
formation can occur and may cause considerable distress in the form of pain, secretion and 
incontinence, as well as psychological suffering. Consequently, patients with CD have severely 
impacted quality of life (QoL), and the disease can affect the patient's ability to sleep and function at 
work or school. The natural history of moderate to severe CD is often progressive, with development of 
penetrating disease and stricture formation, ultimately requiring hospitalization and surgery, and 
lifelong treatment is required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 203/217 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The aim of medical treatment in CD has been focused on controlling inflammation and reducing 
symptoms. In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to heal the gut mucosa. 
Resolution of intestinal ulcers and endoscopic remission have been associated with positive clinical 
benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and few abdominal 
surgeries. However, improvement of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to 
achieve than symptomatic improvement alone. 
Treatment of moderately to severely active CD consists of conventional pharmaceutical therapies such 
as corticosteroids (for short term use) and immunomodulators [e.g., thiopurines and methotrexate], as 
well as biologic therapies. Contrary to the case in Ulcerative colitis (UC), aminosalicylates has shown 
limited efficacy in CD and is not recommended. 
The approval of the first biologic infliximab over two decades ago and a few years later adalimumab 
greatly improved the treatment possibilities in CD. More recently, vedolizumab an anti-integrin and 
ustekinumab an inhibitor of IL-12 and IL-23 has been approved for use in CD. 
Still, a proportion of CD patients have limited efficacy of approved treatments due to failing to respond 
(primary non-response), losing response over time (secondary non-response) or having contra-
indications or intolerance to these medications. Regarding anti-TNF agents, data from clinical trials 
demonstrate that approximately 40% of patients experience primary non-response and secondary loss 
of response has occurred in 38% of patients at 6 months and 50% of patients at 1 year. 
Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new effective treatments in CD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application concerns the use of upadacitinib in CD. Upadacitinib is an oral selective and reversible 
inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK). The JAKs comprise 4 family members: JAK1, 2, 3, and tyrosine kinase 
2 (Tyk2). Upadacitinib more potently inhibits JAK1 compared to JAK2 and JAK3. This is the first 
application for a JAK inhibitor for the use in treatment of CD in EU and it is supported by data from two 
replicate phase 3 induction studies (M14-431 and M14-433) and one phase 3 maintenance study (M14-
430) which were all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multi-centre studies. 
These studies have been performed in both the US and EU as there are different expectances on the 
clinical outcomes where CDAI is used for the FDA analyses and PRO 2 is used for EU analyses. 
The two Phase 3 induction studies (Study M14-431 and Study M14-433) were multicenter studies 
conducted in adult subjects ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 
months and moderately to severely active CD, with average daily very soft stool frequency (SF) score ≥ 
4 or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) ≥ 2.0, and a centrally-read SES-CD ≥ 6 (or ≥ 4 for 
subjects with isolated ileal disease), excluding the narrowing component. 
In Study M14-431, subjects should have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more 
biologic agents (Bio-IR) for CD (adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, 
and/or natalizumab). To be considered Bio-IR, subjects were required to meet criteria for types, doses, 
and durations of prior CD treatment as defined in the protocol. 
In Study M14-433, subjects should have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional 
therapies but had not failed biologic therapy (Non-Bio-IR population) and/or one or more biologic 
agents for CD (Bio-IR population). 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 204/217 
 
 
 
 
In Study M14-433, 45.4% of enrolled subjects were Bio-IR and 54.6% were Non-Bio-IR. Study M14-
431, by design, only enrolled subjects with prior inadequate response and intolerance to biologics, with 
60.8% of subjects having failed at least 2 biologics. 
A total of 1150 subjects were enrolled (1021 subjects randomized into the DB portion and 129 subjects 
enrolled in the OL portion) in the two global Phase 3 induction studies. At the end of the induction 
studies, 674 subjects achieved clinical response to 12-week induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 
mg QD and were re-randomized into the Study M14-430 substudy 1 maintenance period (Cohort 1; of 
whom 673 received at least one dose of study drug). The maintenance primary efficacy analysis was 
performed among the first 502 subjects who were re-randomized and dosed in Study M14-430 
substudy 1 Cohort 1 (Study M14-430 substudy 1. Out of the 1150 subjects randomized in the two 
global phase 3 induction studies, 249 subjects did not achieve clinical response at the end of the 
induction period (Week 12) and were enrolled in the Extended Treatment Period. 
For the maintenance study M14-430 (Cohort 1),502 subjects who received the 12-week induction 
treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg (including those who did not achieve clinical response with placebo 
and then received upadacitinib 45 mg for 12 weeks) and achieved clinical response in Studies M14-431 
or M14-433 were re-randomized to either upadacitinib 30 mg QD, upadacitinib 15 mg QD, or matching 
placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Clinical response was defined as SF/APS ≥ 30% decrease in average daily very 
soft or liquid SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in average daily APS and both not worse than baseline. The 
randomization was stratified by Bio-IR and Non-Bio-IR status in the induction studies, as well as the 
clinical remission (per PROs) and endoscopic response status at the entry of Study M14-430 substudy 
1. 
Dose selection was informed by the analysis of the 16-week safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and 
exposure-response data from Phase 2 CD Study M13-740, which evaluated 5 induction doses of 
upadacitinib using the immediate-release (IR) formulation (3, 6, 12, or 24 mg twice daily [BID] or 24 
mg QD) versus placebo. The results from Study M13-740 demonstrated the clinical and endoscopic 
efficacy of upadacitinib compared to placebo across several endpoints with doses of 6 mg BID and 
higher. Pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that the 12 mg BID and 24 mg BID doses of the IR 
formulation provided similar daily exposures to the 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD dose of the extended-
release (ER) formulation, respectively. Simulations based on the exposure-response analyses showed 
that doses higher than 45 mg QD (e.g., 60 mg QD) were predicted to provide minimal additional 
efficacy (2% to 5% increase), while a dose lower than 45 mg QD (e.g., 30 mg QD) predicted 5% to 
7% lower efficacy for the endoscopic endpoints compared to the 45 mg QD dose. Based on 
pathophysiology and data from other targeted immunomodulatory therapies, a lower dose for 
maintenance was expected to be effective once the initial high disease burden is reduced. Therefore, 
after induction treatment with 45 mg QD, 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses were chosen for maintenance 
treatment. 
In the EMA Guideline (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 2 Guideline on the development of new medicinal 
products for the treatment of Crohn’s disease) “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, it 
is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided”. This is considered as fulfilled. The MAH 
has received Scientific Advice from the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3190/5/2017/II and clarification letter 
EMA/660515/2018) The clinical development plan was discussed and mainly endorsed and being in line 
with the EMA CD GL. Most of the CHMP advice were followed with some minor deviation as discussed 
below. This is one of the first applications using the recommended PROs for efficacy assessment 
recommended in the updated CD guideline. However, for FDA analyses the CDAI score was the clinical 
co-primary endpoint and was analysed in a separate SAP. CDAI was used as a highly ranked secondary 
endpoint in the EU SAP. As the CDAI score has been used for all approved biologics in the treatment in 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 205/217 
 
 
 
 
CD this could bring further validity to the PRO results in this study as CDAI is measured as primary 
endpoint in the same patients. 
The co primary endpoints was the proportion of subjects with clinical remission per SF/APS (average 
daily very soft or liquid SF ≤ 2.8 and not worse than baseline and average daily APS ≤ 1 and not worse 
than baseline)) AND proportion of subjects with endoscopic response (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from 
baseline) assessed at week 12 for the induction studies and at week 52 for the maintenance study. 
Key secondary endpoints included clinical remission per CDAI (CDAI< 150), Endoscopic remission 
(SES-CD < 4), steroid-free clinical remission, change in FACIT-Fatigue score and change in IBDQ. 
The chosen patient populations and endpoints are accepted although a more stringent endoscopic-
primary endpoint would have been preferred (see further discussion in 2.4.3. ). The sample size, 
randomisations procedures and conduct of the studies are acceptable. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Induction 
Study M14-431 included patients with incomplete response to biologic therapies. At week 12 the 
results for the clinical remission co-primary endpoint showed that 39.8% of subjects treated with 
45mg upa QD achieved clinical remission per PROs compared to 14% of the placebo. In the endoscopic 
co primary endpoint endoscopic response, 34.6% of patients in active treatment responded compared 
to 3.5% in the placebo group. For the US/FDA clinical co primary endpoint CDAI remission the 
corresponding figures were 38.9 % for active treatment and 21,1% for placebo. All these analyses had 
high statistical significance with p<0.0001. 
Induction study M14-433 included patients with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional 
therapies but had not failed biologic therapy (Non-Bio-IR population) and/or one or more biologic 
agents for CD (Bio-IR population). At week 12 the results for the co primary clinical endpoints showed 
that 50.7% of patients in active treatment responded with clinical remission per PROs compared to 
placebo 22.2%. For the co primary endpoint endoscopic response 45.5% responded in active 
treatment arm compared to 13.1% in placebo group. The corresponding figures for CDAI was 49.5% in 
active treatment with 29.1% in the placebo group. 
In both induction studies all the key secondary clinical endpoints such as corticosteroid free clinical 
remission and QoL showed highly statistically significance and clinically relevant results. 
Concerning the important endpoint key secondary endoscopic remission 19,1% reached this endpoint 
in study M14-431 compared to 2.3% in the placebo group. In study M14-433 the corresponding results 
were 28.9% and 7.4% respectively. In addition, the more stringent endoscopic remission endpoint 
(SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore-mucosal healing) showed beneficial results for active treatment 
where 17% reached this endpoint in study M13-431 compared to 0 patients in placebo group. In study 
M14-433 the corresponding figures were 25%& and 55 respectively p<0.0001.  
Maintenance 
Maintenance treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg was superior to placebo in achieving clinical 
remission per SF/APS (35.5%, 46.4% and 14.4% respectively) and endoscopic response (40.1%, 
27.6% and 7.3% respectively) at Week 52. 
Most key secondary endpoints under the pre-defined strategy for overall Type-I error control were 
achieved with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg treatment compared with placebo. Superiority was 
observed for endoscopic remission and the more stringent endpoint of deep remission (combined 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 206/217 
 
 
 
 
clinical and endoscopic remission), as well as for steroid-free clinical remission irrespective of steroid 
use at baseline. The result for the higher dose was overall more robust but clinically relevant results 
were found also for the lower maintenance dose.  
However, the definition of endoscopic co-primary endpoint at week 52 is not the most relevant as it is 
preferred to aim at endoscopic remission because it is assumed that is important to achieve healing of 
the mucosa to prevent structural complications in the bowel. However, as the totality of data especially 
including the more strictly defined endoscopic endpoints clinical remission SES-SD <4 and also SES-CD 
0-2 met statistically significance that was deemed as clinically relevant and therefore it is considered 
that the efficacy on intestinal mucosa is shown. 
Most key secondary endpoints under the pre-defined strategy for overall Type-I error control were 
achieved with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg treatment compared with placebo. Superiority was 
observed for endoscopic remission and the more stringent endpoint of deep remission (combined 
clinical and endoscopic remission), as well as for steroid-free clinical remission irrespective of steroid 
use at Baseline. Maintenance of clinical remission was achieved among subjects in clinical remission at 
Week 0. Improvements from Baseline for FACIT-Fatigue and resolution of EIMs continued with 
upadacitinib 30 mg maintenance therapy. Results of stringent endoscopic assessments (absence of 
ulcers by endoscopy [US]/mucosal healing [EU], SES-CD 0-2) and mean changes in markers FCP and 
hs-CRP support continued improvement of inflammation up to Week 52 on upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 
mg QD. This is adequately reflected in the dosing recommendations in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Altogether the clinical study programme in Crohn´s disease shows a robust clinical efficacy in nearly all 
chosen endpoint an aspect of Crohn’s disease. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The PROs stool frequency and abdominal pain are often the most bothersome symptoms for the 
patients suffering from CD. The earlier CDAI score used in clinical trials for CD treatment includes 
these symptoms as well but also general wellbeing, the presence of extraintestinal symptoms, the 
presence of a palpable abdominal mass and has several limitations including a complex calculation and 
high score has been shown even for patient with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, with any 
of these symptoms score it is crucial to combine the clinical score with an endoscopic assessment as a 
co-primary endpoint which is the case in these studies. The CDAI score was included as a ranked 
secondary endpoint in the EU and the co primary endpoint it the separate SAP for US/FDA. This makes 
it possible to a certain limit to compare the results for SF/APS and CDAI considering that CDAI has 
been used as an endpoint in previous applications for treatments of Crohn’s disease in EU as well. 
In the study programme for CD the MAH has chosen the co-primary endpoint endoscopic response 
although endoscopic remission is the preferred endpoint in the updated EMA GL and also suggested in 
the CHMP advice. However, as several stringent endoscopic assessments including endoscopic 
remission (SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 2-point reduction versus baseline and no subscore > 1 in any 
individual variable) and mucosal healing (SES-CD ulcerated surface subscore of 0 in patients with SES-
CD ulcerated surface subscore ≥ 1 at baseline) showed statistically significant and clinically relevant 
results this has been considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Further, CD is a disease that is difficult to treat and even if about 45% of patients achieve clinical 
remission after induction treatment and approximately the same proportion of patients (46%) achieves 
clinical remission with maintenance dosing of 30 mg QD and 35% of patients with 15mg QD 
maintenance dosing. Therefore, it is evident that there is still unmet need for treatments in Crohn 
Assessment report

disease. Moreover, no data is available for any potential effect on fistulas which is a very bothersome 
complication to CD. 
The primary suggestion for the wording of the indication was “Upadacitinib is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic 
agent, or for whom such therapies are not advisable”. However, the last section of the proposed 
indication “or for whom such therapies are not advisable” was not accepted by the CHMP as it is not in 
line with the population included. In response to the 1st Request for Supplementary Information (RSI), 
the MAH submitted a revised wording for the claimed indication in which this claim has been removed 
as requested by the CHMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the placebo-controlled 12-week induction period, the frequency of AEs was 62.2% in the 
placebo group and 65.1% in the UPA group. SAEs occurred in 8.4% in the placebo group and 8.0 % in 
the UPA group. The frequency of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was higher in the placebo 
group (5.5% vs 4.9%). In the maintenance period, the EAERs of TEAEs overall, SAEs, and severe 
TEAEs were higher in the placebo group compared with both upadacitinib treatment groups.   
Common adverse events in the CD studies were in line with previously known AEs. In the induction 
phase, the most frequently reported TEAEs in the UPA 45 mg group were acne, nasopharyngitis, 
anaemia, and headache. These are all listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and do not constitute any new 
safety signals. In the maintenance phase, the EAERs of TEAEs reported at ≥ 5 E/100 PY in the placebo 
group were generally higher than or similar to those in the upadacitinib groups; exceptions included 
COVID-19 in both upadacitinib groups and upper respiratory tract infection in the upadacitinib 30 mg 
group.  
Three deaths were reported in the Phase 3 CD clinical program and one additional death was reported 
in the phase 2 program. Two deaths, one due to septic shock and one due to postoperative 
complication, also with sepsis, occurred >150 days after discontinuing UPA and are unlikely to be 
caused by UPA. The other two deaths were related to COVID-19 infection; one treatment-emergent 
death due to COVID-19 was reported for a subject receiving upadacitinib 30 mg during extended 
treatment and one treatment-emergent death due to COVID-19 pneumonia was reported for a subject 
who received rescue with upadacitinib 30 mg during long-term treatment. It could not be ruled out 
that UPA contributed to these events. There is already a statement in the Section 4.4 of the SmPC that 
serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib and no 
additional update is necessary. 
SAEs reported in more than 1 subject during induction treatment were worsening of CD (UPA 2.1%, 
Placebo 4.3%), GI haemorrhage and intestinal obstruction (3 [0.4%] subjects each in the upadacitinib 
45 mg group), anal abscess (3 [0.4%] subjects in the upadacitinib 45 mg group and 3 [0.9%] subjects 
in the placebo group); and abdominal pain, ileus, and nephrolithiasis (2 [0.3%] subjects each in the 
upadacitinib 45 mg group). In the maintenance phase, the EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs was 
higher in the placebo group (31.8 E/100 PY) compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg (16.9 E/100 PY) 
and 30 mg (18.0 E/100 PY) groups.  Most SAEs were reported no more than once in each group, 
except for worsening of CD (11 subjects in the placebo group, 8 subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
group). 
During the induction phase, the percentage of subjects with serious infections was similar in subjects 
receiving upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo (1.9% and 1.7%, respectively). The most commonly 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 208/217 
 
 
 
 
reported serious infections were of gastrointestinal infections. Also, in patients who were non 
responders at week 12 and received extended treatment, the EAER of serious infections (19.4 E/100 
PY) was similar to the rate reported during the initial 12 weeks of induction treatment (21.3 E/100 PY). 
During the maintenance phase, the EAERs of TEAEs of serious infections were higher in the placebo 
group (7.2 E/100PY) compared with the upadacitinib 15 mg group (4.0 E/100PY) and upadacitinib 30 
mg group (5.7 E/100PY). The event rates of serious infections were however slightly higher with 
progression of time for the upadacitinib 30 mg cohorts, but the types of serious infections observed 
were consistent with those anticipated. No new safety signals were observed, and serious infection is 
adequately addressed in the Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No events of active TB were reported in the studies. Opportunistic infections (excluding TB and herpes 
zoster) were uncommon. Herpes zoster was reported in 20 subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg as 
induction treatment, while no event of herpes zoster was reported in subjects receiving placebo. 
During maintenance treatment, higher rates of herpes zoster were observed with upadacitinib 30 mg 
compared with upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo. The majority of herpes zoster events were cutaneous, 
with cases involving 3 or more dermatomes reported in 12.9% of subjects in the any upadacitinib 
treatment cohort.  Four subjects experienced events with ophthalmic involvement.  Herpes zoster is a 
well-known common AE regarding UPA treatment, a class effect for JAK inhibitors, and is adequately 
described in the SmPC. No updates are deemed required.  
No TEAE of malignancy, malignancy excluding NMSC, NMSC, or lymphoma was reported in the 
induction phase. During maintenance and long term follow up the EAIR of TEAEs of malignancy 
excluding NMSC was 0.4 n/100 PY in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, 1.1 n/100 PY and 0.7 n/100 PY in 
the placebo group. As noted previously, for other indications, a dose-dependent increase in EAIR for 
malignancy was seen; however, the numbers of malignancies were few and no specific pattern in type 
of malignancies are reported.  
There were no cases of MACE reported in the induction Phase or in the UPA 15 mg group. Two (2) 
events occurred in the rescue group (non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI). Additionally, there were 2 
events (acute MI and pneumonia aspiration with abnormal cardiac enzymes) adjudicated as MACE 
reported in the Phase 2 studies. A dose-dependency is observed; however, the total number of cases 
are few hampering firm conclusions. The risk of MACE is already adequately addressed in the SmPC; 
no update was deemed necessary based on the information submitted as part of this application. 
During the induction phase, there were no VTE case reported in the CD studies. However, during the 
maintenance, adjudicated VTE was reported in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg cohort with an incidence 
rate of VTE of 0.6 n/100 PY, and none was reported in the upadacitinib 45 mg/15 mg cohort. 
ALT and AST elevation was one of the most commonly reported AEs, occurring in ≥3% of patients and 
thus included in the description of commonly reported events for CD in the SmPC 4.8. During induction 
treatment, ≤ 1.0% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 45 mg experienced an ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of hepatic disorder were primarily mild or moderate elevations in 
transaminases; no events were serious and discontinuation of study drug due to hepatic disorder was 
uncommon. Two biochemical Hy's law cases were identified but had alternate aetiologies that 
accounted for the increased ALT/AST and TBL. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the extended treatment group (patients that did not respond on 45 mg UPA after 12 week 
treatment and continued to receive 30 mg UPA OL for additional 12 weeks) the EAERs for the most 
frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) in the upadacitinib 45 mg/30 mg group through Week 24 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 209/217 
 
 
 
 
were generally similar to rates reported during the initial 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg treatment; 
except higher rates of worsening of CD, influenza and herpes zoster. The EAERs of SAEs, severe 
TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were however higher than the rates 
observed during the initial 12 weeks of induction treatment.  The EAER of treatment-emergent SAEs 
increased with longer duration of exposure to upadacitinib, primarily driven by worsening of CD (64.5 
E/100 PY through Week 24 compared with 51.8 E/100 PY during the initial 12 weeks of treatment). 
Upon request, the MAH provided additional information regarding 122 patients (excluding the patient 
that initially received placebo for 12 weeks) There were no major differences in safety profiles between 
the 12-week induction with upadacitinib 45 mg and the 24-week treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg/30 
mg, with the exception of overall SAEs (primarily driven by worsening of CD in 7 patients). Further, 
there were no GI perforations during the extended treatment for the 122 subjects receiving extended 
treatment 30mg QD after 45 mg QD induction treatment. This is reassuring and the extended 
treatment dosing recommendations in Section 4.2 of the SmPC  are considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  
In line with the existing warning and dose reduction recommendations in patients at higher risk of VTE, 
MACE and malignancy implemented as part of the Art 20 JAKi referral (see 2.1.2. ), the dosing 
recommendations in Section 4.2 of the SmPC have been adjusted for CD patients to state that a 
maintenance dose of 15 mg is recommended for patients at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy.  
In addition, 10 patients experienced GI perforation in the pivotal studies, and 3 additional patients in 
the phase 2 studies, which is the highest amount across indications. In almost all cases, the event led 
to discontinuation of UPA. The event occurred in one patient receiving UPA during induction treatment 
and 3 patients during the extended treatment period and in several patients receiving rescue 
treatment with UPA 30 mg in the maintenance phase. Although it is acknowledged that several 
patients had severe active CD, strictures or other signs of severe disease, reflecting a patient group 
with a higher risk of GI perforations, there is a concern regarding the safety of treatment with UPA in 
these patients. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor therapy has been associated with an increased risk of 
gastrointestinal perforations and given UPAs effects on the IL-6 signalling pathway, GI- perforation is 
considered an AESI and was included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Upon CHMP’s request, 
the MAH provided additional information regarding the patients that experienced a GI-perforation 
event. In the majority of the GI-perforation cases, there were signs of active, progressing CD at the 
time of the event and thus, worsening of the underlying disease could be a possibly explanation for the 
events as suggested by the MAH. However, all but one event occurred in patients on UPA-treatment. 
In addition, some patients with a higher risk of perforation were excluded from the study and there is 
a biological plausible reason why this event could be associated with the treatment. Hence, at CHMP’s 
request, the MAH included GI perforation as an uncommon ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. In 
addition, the Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include information that patients with 
active Crohn´s disease are at increased risk for developing GI-perforation and that patients should be 
evaluated promptly if presenting with new onset of related abdominal signs and symptoms. GI 
perforation was changed to an Important identified risks in the RMP (see 2.6. ) and the MAH has 
updated the RMP with a long-Term Safety Study of Upadacitinib Use in UC and CD Patients in Europe. 
As part of the main objectives of the study, the monitoring of GI perforation is included. This is 
acceptable. 
In the clinical CD studies, numerically more fractures were seen in patients treated with UPA than 
placebo, but since the information provided only lists the different fractured bone separately, and no 
information regarding the total amount of fractures are displayed, the analysed data is difficult to 
interpret. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH performed a comprehensive analysis of fractures reported in 
the Crohn's disease (CD) program and other indication programs for upadacitinib. The EAER of 
Assessment report  
EMA/113995/2023 
Page 210/217 
 
 
 
 
fractures was 2.9 E/100 PY during the induction phase in the CD program. All cases (6) occurred in the 
UPA treated group; however, all 6 cases were assessed as having no relation to study drug.  
In the maintenance phase, with treatment duration up to 52 weeks, the EAERs of TEAEs of fractures 
were similar in the upadacitinib 15 mg (0.9 E/100 PY) and 30 mg (0.8 E/100 PY) groups compared 
with the placebo group (0.7 E/PY.)  In the overall population ever treated with UPA, 18 events were 
seen (1.5 E/100 PY). The overall exposure-adjusted long-term event rates of fracture by indication was 
highest in patients with RA and lowest in patients with CD.  
In conclusion, the update of the product information with new information on fracture is not warranted 
at this stage. However, fracture will remain as an important potential risk in the RMP for upadacitinib. 
The MAH will continue to gather additional data to characterize fractures in ongoing clinical trials, in 
long-term post-authorization safety studies, and from post marketing data. The MAH has updated the 
RMP with a long-Term Safety Study of Upadacitinib Use in UC and CD Patients in Europe. As part of the 
main objectives of the study, the monitoring of fractures is included. This is acceptable. 
Overall, long-term data for upadacitinib are still limited, since upadacitinib was first approved in 2019. 
Regarding unusual events such as malignancies and MACE, no updates are deemed required based on 
the findings from the current study.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The two pivotal induction studies demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
superiority of Upadacitinib 45 mg compared to placebo in inducing the co-primary endpoint, clinical 
remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn´s disease. A superior efficacy was seen in 
symptomatic relieve already at week 2 (CR-100) and week 4 (SF/APS), and after 12 weeks of 
induction treatment with 45 mg upadacitinib QD, 45.5% of patients achieved clinical SF/APS remission 
with active treatment compared to 18.2% in the placebo group in the integrated analyses. Further, 
important clinical key secondary endpoints such as steroid free clinical remission and QoL showed 
highly statistically significant and clinically relevant result at week 12.

The co-primary endpoint endoscopic response has well demonstrated a significant difference between 
active treatment and placebo in the integrated induction analyses with 40.3% responders in active 
treatment compared to 8.4% in placebo group. For endoscopic remission the corresponding figures 
were 24.4% and 4.9% for active treatment and placebo. In addition, Upadacitinib provided a beneficial 
effect compared to placebo regarding the strictest endpoint, mucosal healing (SES-CD) at week 12 
with a treatment difference of 17% and 20% respectively for study M14-431 and M14-433 compared 
to placebo.  
In the maintenance study statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically relevant treatment 
differences between both Upadacitinib doses (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo were observed for the 
co-primary and all key secondary endpoints with the exception of CD hospitalisation and effect on 
extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) for the 15 mg. There was a clear dose response showing more 
robust effect with the higher maintenance dosing. For example, clinical remission per SF/APS score 
was reached by 46.4% of patients treated with 30 mg maintenance dosing compared to 35.5% treated 
with 15 mg. The corresponding figure for placebo was 15.1%. Especially in patients with a high disease 
burden and in patients in need of a prolonged induction regimen, the 30 mg dose seemed to provide a 
more pronounced beneficial effect over the 15 mg dose. The proposal to be able to choose 
maintenance (15 mg or 30 mg) dose after the individual patient’s characteristics is therefore endorsed 
and reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. However, in line with the conclusion of the JAKi referral (see 
2.1.2. ), it is stated in Section 4.2 of the SmPC that a dose of 30 mg once daily may be appropriate for 
CD patients with high disease burden who are not at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy. 
The safety profile of Rinvoq has been well characterised through studies in the currently approved 
indications. The induction (45 mg) and maintain doses (15 mg and 30 mg) are similar as the doses in 
the recently approved UC indication. The safety profile is similar to the already known safety profile 
with respect to common AEs. There are concerns regarding a higher amount of gastrointestinal 
perforation in the CD studies. As a consequence, new warning with regard to gastrointestinal 
perforation has been added to the Section 4.4 and Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of SmPC have been updated 
accordingly. The Annex II.D Guide for healthcare professionals and patient card have been updated 
accordingly. This risk will be monitored as part of a post authorisation safety study (See RMP 2.6. ). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Upadacitinib is an oral treatment which can be a valuable additional treatment option for Crohn´s 
Disease as it has shown efficacy especially in patients that have not responded or lost response to 
biologic therapy. In the phase 3 study programme, the treatment with updacitinib has shown a robust 
beneficial effect both on primary and important secondary clinical and endoscopic endpoints  in 
patients who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional 
therapy or a biologic agent. The overall safety profile observed in patients with CD is generally 
consistent with that observed in patients with other approved indications. A new warning with regard 
to gastrointestinal perforation has been added to the product information. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rinvoq is positive in the indication “RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response, 
lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent”.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adult 
patients for RINVOQ, based on final results from three Phase III studies, two confirmatory placebo-
controlled induction studies (Study M14 431/U-EXCEED/CD-1) and Study M14 433/U-EXCEL/CD-2) and 
a placebo-controlled maintenance/long-term extension study (Study M14-430/U-ENDURE/CD-3). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC and the Annex II.D are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 13.3 of the RMP has been adopted. 
The MAH also took this opportunity to correct some figures in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH will make corrections to some of the translations as part of the linguistic review: 
the updates are generally either grammatical corrections, QRD alignments or correction to align with 
the EN text. The Romanian (RO), French(FR), Danish(DA), Italian(IT), Czech(CS), Polish(PL), 
Norwegian (NO), Portuguese (PT), Latvian(LV) and Bulgarian (BG) translations are affected. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above.

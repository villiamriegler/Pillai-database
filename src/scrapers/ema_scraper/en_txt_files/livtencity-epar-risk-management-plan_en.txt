Estimates of CMV infection and disease in European countries 
indicate that  in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, CMV 
infection occurs in  up to 46.5%  (France) and CMV disease can 
occur in  up to 16.0% (Spain). Following  Hematopoietic 
stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in  Spain the incidence of CMV 
infection and disease has been observed in up to 53.8%  and 
4.8% transplant  recipients, respectively. A summary of 
European estimates of CMV incidence and disease based on 
recent publications is presented below:

Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous  beta herpesvirus that 
commonly infects humans. Primary infection with  CMV is 
typically asymptomatic [24].  Serologic evidence of prior 
infection can be found in  40-100%  of various adult 
populations [25].  Assays of donor blood samples drawn from 
313 healthy volunteers with no medical history of CMV infection 
for presence of CMV antibodies and CMV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
detected CMV antibodies in 117 (37%)  of the samples, and 
CMV-specific RNA was detected in 136  (43%) of samples. Of 
the 196  samples negative for CMV antibodies, 44% tested 
positive for CMV RNA [26]. 
Annually, approximately 45,000 SOTs [27]  and 
19,000  allogeneic stem-cell transplants [28] are performed 
across Europe. Following a transplantation,  CMV infection can 
result from the  transmission of CMV virions from donor tissue, 
or from reactivation of a latent CMV infection  in the transplant 
recipient. The risk of CMV infection is influenced by a number of 
factors such as the CMV serostatus of the  donor and recipient, 
the type of organ transplanted, the  net state of the host 
immunosuppression, and viral factors. Both directly and 
indirectly, CMV infection is the leading viral cause of morbidity 
and mortality amongst SOT recipients [29]. Graft loss is a 
known significant and indirect effect of CMV disease in SOT

Cytomegalovirus infection or disease in adult transplant patients who 
are resistant or refractory to prior therapy 
Risk factors for the  disease: 
The main existing treatment 
options: 
recipients and can occur in 7.9% SOT recipients with  CMV 
disease [15].  In allogeneic HSCT recipients, patients with  CMV 
infection have approximately 2-fold higher risk of overall 
mortality [30]. 
Immunocompromised individuals, including  those treated with 
immunosuppressive drugs following  HSCT or SOT, have the 
greatest risk for serious CMV disease. Seropositivity status of 
the donor and recipient is the main risk factor for invasive CMV 
disease in both HSCT and SOT. For HSCT, recipients who are 
seropositive (R+) at the time of transplant  are at greatest risk 
for symptomatic CMV infection.  Without  prophylaxis, 
approximately 80% of CMV-seropositive patients experience 
CMV infection after allogeneic HSCT. Current preventive 
strategies have decreased the incidence of CMV disease, which 
had historically occurred in  20% to 35%  of these patients  [31]. 
In SOT, seronegative patients who receive seropositive grafts 
are also at increased risk for primary CMV transmission and 
clinical disease. In kidney transplant recipients, the highest 
incidence of symptomatic CMV infection (syndrome) or disease 
occurs in CMV seronegative recipients who receive a kidney 
from a CMV-seropositive donor (D+/R-) [32-35].  CMV disease 
is associated with  increased morbidity, mortality, and poor 
long-term outcomes [36,37]. Allograft rejection is a major risk 
factor for CMV, especially when patients are treated with 
lymphocyte-depleting antibodies, and the  risk of CMV varies by 
transplant type with  vascularized composite allograft tissue and 
small intestinal transplant  recipients at highest  risk among SOT 
populations [38]. 
With  regards to demographic characteristics including  age, sex, 
and race there are little  to no risk factors associated with CMV 
incidence following SOT and HSCT. Research has indicated that 
these demographic factors do not play a role in CMV incidence 
following SOT [39,40].  However, older age may play a role in 
CMV reactivation following  allogenic-HSCT [41,42].  This may be 
due to the increased prevalence of CMV seropositivity in  the 
general population with  increasing age [42,43].  It should be 
noted that  the prevalence of CMV seropositivity in the  general 
population is greater in females and non-whites  [43]. 
There are limited  therapeutic options available to treat CMV 
infection in the  transplant population. Ganciclovir was approved 
by the European Medicine Agency for the treatment of CMV 
disease in immunocompromised patients. However, there are 
no approved therapies to treat CMV infections that  are 
resistant/refractory to prior antiviral therapy. These patients 
are at highest  risk of developing or already have developed 
serious CMV complications and are left with  limited or no viable 
options. While physicians use a variety of strategies with 
existing anti-CMV agents to overcome treatment 
resistance/refractoriness (e.g., increasing dose, decreasing 
immunosuppression, administering growth  factors to combat 
hematotoxicity, dose reductions to minimise renal toxicity,

Cytomegalovirus infection or disease in adult transplant patients who 
are resistant or refractory to prior therapy 
Natural history of the indicated 
condition in the  untreated 
population, including  mortality 
and morbidity: 
Important co-morbidities: 
etc.), there are still  patients that  exhaust treatment  options 
and ultimately lose their graft or die as a result of CMV 
infection or disease [44-47]. 
Serious HCMV disease occurs almost exclusively in individuals 
with  compromised or immature immune systems, including 
transplant recipients, patients with  acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS), immunosuppressed cancer patients, and 
neonates. Disease manifestations include retinitis,  colitis, 
esophagitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and meningoencephalitis. 
CMV disease may present as CMV syndrome manifesting as 
fever, malaise, atypical lymphocytosis, leukopenia or 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic 
transaminases, or as end‐organ CMV disease such as 
gastrointestinal (GI) disease, pneumonitis, hepatitis,  nephritis, 
myocarditis, pancreatitis, encephalitis, retinitis,  or other 
end-organ disease [38].  CMV is more likely to infect  the 
transplanted allograft. Without  prophylaxis, CMV disease 
typically occurs within  3 months following SOT and HSCT. 
Estimated incidences of early CMV disease (before day 
100 post-transplant)  and late CMV disease (after day 100) in 
CMV-seropositive allogeneic recipients are currently around 5% 
and 15% [48].  Both directly and indirectly, CMV infection is the 
leading viral cause of morbidity and mortality amongst SOT 
recipients [29]. Graft loss is a known significant and indirect 
effect of CMV disease in SOT recipients and can occur in 
7.9% SOT recipients with CMV disease [15].  In allogeneic 
HSCT recipients, patients with  CMV infection have 
approximately 2-fold higher risk of overall mortality [30]. 
CMV disease is associated with  an increased incidence of 
opportunistic infections,  an association between C MV and 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) predominately in HSCT 
patients, and associations between CMV and graft rejection or 
other allograft pathology in SOT patients, and reduced patient 
survival [49-51].  Such organ-specific associations with  CMV 
include bronchiolitis obliterans in lung recipients, vanishing bile 
duct syndrome in liver recipients, accelerated transplant 
vasculopathy in heart recipients and transplant  glomerulopathy, 
transplant renal artery stenosis or increased risk of transplant 
rejection [52-57].  These effects are believed to be mediated by 
the virus’s ability to modulate the immune system, either 
directly or secondary to the host antiviral response through 
regulation of cytokine, chemokine, and/or growth factor 
production.

Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety 
specification 
A comprehensive non-clinical testing  program including pharmacodynamics, secondary 
pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology has been completed to 
support oral dosing of maribavir in the treatment  of transplant  patients with  CMV infection or 
disease resistant or refractory to current CMV agents. For the non-clinical development program rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the primary rodent and nonrodent species, respectively.  
The toxicological assessment of maribavir included single -dose oral and intravenous studies in mice 
and rats, and oral repeat-dose toxicity studies with  dosing durations of up to  13 weeks in mice, 
26 weeks in  Sprague-Dawley rats, and 52  weeks in cynomolgus monkeys. 
The genotoxic potential  of maribavir was evaluated in-vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation and 
mouse lymphoma assays, and in  vivo in a micronucleus assay in rats, and the carcinogenic potential 
of maribavir was assessed in lifetime bioassays in mice and rats. To establish the potential for 
reproductive and/or developmental toxicity, fertility, combined embryo/foetal development, and 
pre-and postnatal  development studies were conducted in rats and/or rabbits, and juvenile toxicity 
was investigated in rats. Local irritation  (eye and dermal) studies in rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs, 
immunotoxicity assessment in rats and an in-vitro phototoxicity study were also conducted. 
Important safety findings  from completed non-clinical studies with maribavir are summarised below. 
Key Safety  Findings 
Relevance  to human usage 
There is a potential for mild to moderate 
anaemia and/or GI-related events such as 
diarrhoea. 
Toxicity: 
Single and Repeat-dose  toxicity studies 
Mortality  was observed following single doses 
in mice and rats at  doses ≥500 mg/kg and 
≥ 1000  mg/kg, respectively. In repeat-dose 
studies, mortality was observed in mice at 
doses ≥ 300  mg/kg/day (19 males and 
18 females), and in rats at 400  mg/kg/day in 
the chronic 26-week study  (1 male and 
4 females). In the 52-week monkey study, 
2 males at  400/300  mg/kg/day and 1 male at 
200 mg/kg/day were euthanised in extremis. 
In pivotal repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in 
rats (6 months) and monkeys (12 months), 
the major findings  were reversible 
regenerative anaemia and histologic change of 
mucosal cell hyperplasia in the intestinal  tract 
associated with  clinical observations of soft to 
liquid stool, electrolyte changes and 
dehydration, which were reversible or showed 
progression to recovery after cessation of 
dosing. The GI effects were representative of 
human GI-related adverse events. A no 
observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not 
established in monkeys and was therefore 
considered to be <100 mg/kg/day, the lowest 
dose tested.  In rats, the NOAEL  was 
considered to be 25 mg/kg/day. Whilst  the 
NOAELs / lowest-observed-adverse-effect 
levels were at  sub-therapeutic exposures, the

Key Safety  Findings 
Relevance  to human usage 
key toxicities were reversible upon 
discontinuation  of treatment  and are clinically 
monitorable. 
Reproductive and Developmental  Toxicity: 
Maribavir did not  affect fertility  or reproductive 
performance in rats, nor was it teratogenic in 
rats (up to 400  mg/kg/day) or rabbits (up  to 
100 mg/kg/day). However, at doses 
≥ 100  mg/kg/day in male rats a decrease in 
the sperm straight  line velocity was observed, 
while in female pregnant rats a decrease in 
number of viable foetuses and increase in 
early resorptions and post-implantation  losses 
were observed, likely due to maternal toxicity. 
In a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity 
study in rats, decreased pup survival due to 
poor maternal care and reduced body weight 
gain associated with  a delay in developmental 
milestones were observed at doses 
≥ 150  mg/kg/day. However, the subsequent 
fertility and mating performance of these 
offspring, and their ability to maintain 
pregnancy and to deliver live offspring, were 
unaffected by maribavir. 
Genotoxicity: 
Maribavir was not  mutagenic in  the bacterial 
mutation  assay but demonstrated mutagenic 
potential in  the absence of metabolic 
activation in the mouse lymphoma assay. 
However, in  rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay, maribavir was not clastogenic up  to a 
very high oral dose of 1200 mg/kg that 
elicited toxicity. Based on the totality  of 
evidence from the studies  conducted, 
maribavir is not considered to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity: 
Maribavir did not  have an effect on fertility and 
is not considered to be teratogenic. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether maribavir or its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
The weight of evidence from in-vitro and in-vivo 
genotoxicity studies indicate that maribavir does 
not exhibit genotoxic potential. 
Maribavir was not  carcinogenic in the 2-year 
study in rats up to 100  mg/kg/day. No 
neoplastic lesions were observed up to doses 
of 300 mg/kg/day in  the 13-week oral toxicity 
study in CD-1 mice. However, in a 2-year 
study in CD-1 mice, an equivocal increase in 
the incidence of hemangioma, 
hemangiosarcoma, and combined 
hemangioma/hemangiosarcoma across 
multiple tissues was noted in males given 
150 mg/kg/day (high dose). These findings 
For the treatment  of CMV infection, maribavir 
will be administered to transplant patients twice 
a day for 8 weeks. Hence the increased 
incidence of hemangioma/hemangiosarcoma in 
male mice following daily administration for 
104 weeks is of uncertain relevance in terms of 
its translation  to human risk given the difference 
in frequency of administration and the lack of an 
effect in female mice or in rats after 104 weeks 
of administration, lack of any proliferative effects 
in male and female mice after 13 weeks of 
administration, and the negative genotoxicity

package. 
No evidence of potential human risk to central 
nervous system (CNS),  cardiovascular (CV), 
respiratory or autonomic functions. 
Safety  pharmacology: 
In a series of safety pharmacology studies 
maribavir had no major effects on the central 
nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
or autonomic functions. 
There was no effect on human ether-a-go-go 
related gene (hERG) currents up to the 
highest maribavir concentration of 
1254  µg/mL. 
The cardiovascular, respiratory and autonomic 
function were evaluated in the anesthetized 
dogs. At a bolus dose of maribavir 43  mg/kg 
there were increases in heart rate, with  no 
significant effect on mean arterial pressure. A 
transient increase in respiratory rate and 
volume was observed that returned to 
pre-drug levels. There was no effect on 
autonomic function. ECGs were not  evaluated 
in this  study. 
A CV-telemetry study in animal models to 
assess the effects of maribavir on QTc 
intervals was not  conducted. However, in a 
definitive TQT study  in healthy human 
subjects, maribavir did not have clinically 
significant effects on repolarization (QTc 
interval) or other electrocardiographic 
parameters at 100 mg and 1200  mg doses. 
The positive control moxifloxacin 
demonstrated the expected effects and assay 
sensitivity. 
Other  toxicity-related  information or data: 
Immunogenicity 
Maribavir did not  demonstrate any 
immunological liability in rats at doses up to 
100 mg/kg/day. 
Maribavir is considered not  to have an any 
immunotoxic potential. 
Phototoxicity 
In-vitro maribavir was not  phototoxic at 
concentrations up to 100 μg/mL  in BALB/c 3T3 
mouse fibroblasts. 
The potential for phototoxicity is considered 
unlikely. 
Drug-Drug Interaction 
In-vitro maribavir is a weak time-dependent 
inhibitor  for cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and 
Maribavir can be dosed with  CYP3A inhibitors

Key Safety  Findings 
Relevance  to human usage 
antiviral efficacy dose increase is necessary 
when concomitant administration  with CYP3A 
inducers is needed. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions is 
considered to be low and dose adjustment of 
maribavir is only needed when maribavir is 
concomitant administered with a strong or 
moderate CYP3A4 inducer. With  the exception of 
selected immunosuppressants, digoxin and 
rosuvastatin, concomitant administration with 
maribavir does not  impact the use or outcomes 
of a wide range of other drugs commonly used in 
the target patient  population (refer to 
Section SVII). 
weak inducer of CYP3A4. PBPK modeling 
predicted a less than 2-fold increase in 
systemic exposure to maribavir following 
concomitant administration of CYP3A4 
inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, 
erythromycin, and diltiazem. However, CYP3A 
inducers significantly reduce maribavir 
exposure; therefore, to ensure antiviral 
efficacy (using the BID trough  concentration 
at 12 hours as the marker), maribavir dose 
increase is necessary when concomitant 
administration with  CYP3A inducers is needed. 
Mechanism  for Drug Interactions 
Maribavir is an in-vitro substrate of CYP3A4 
and to a minor extent by CYP1A2 and uridine 
5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) 1A3, UGT2B7, possibly UGT1A9, 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1,  and breast cancer 
resistant protein (BCRP). 
In-vitro maribavir is a weak time-dependent 
inhibitor  of CYP3A4 (nifedipine but not 
midazolam or testosterone), and weak 
inhibitor  of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, 
P-gp, BCRP, organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 3,  multidrug 
and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE)1,  and 
bile salt export pump. Maribavir is also a 
moderate inhibitor  of BCRP.  
In vitro, Maribavir is a weak inducer of 
CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, but not  CYP2B6.

in pregnant or nursing 
women. Therefore, the 
possibility of foetal harm 
during pregnancy is not 
known. It is unknown 
whether maribavir is 
excreted in human milk

Maribavir is not 
recommended during 
pregnancy and in women

not using contraception. 
Moreover, breast feeding 
should be discontinued 
during treatment with 
maribavir. Thus, there is 
no anticipated utilisaton  in 
these populations 
In study 1263-103, 
patients with  moderate 
hepatic impairment 
showed substantially 
slower elimination  and 
higher plasma 
concentrations of 
maribavir than healthy 
patients given the same 
dose. However, this 
increased exposure to 
maribavir is not 
considered clinically 
significant. It  is expected 
that  severe hepatic

Part II: Module SVII - Identified and potential risks 
SVII.1. Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission 
SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients  (in relation to the  severity of t he indication 
treated): 
• 
Taste disturbance (ageusia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia and taste disorder),  
•  Headache,  
•  Abdominal pain upper,  
•  Decreased appetite. 
Taste disturbance (ageusia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia and taste disorder) is very commonly reported 
as a non-serious adverse reaction. These adverse events rarely led to  drug discontinuation  (0.9%). 
For most patients,  taste disturbance resolved while patients remained on therapy (37%) or resolved 
at a median of 7 days (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 95% CI: 4, 8) off treatment. 
Headache, abdominal pain upper and decreased appetite are ‘commonly’ reported as non -serious 
adverse reaction. All these events are listed in  Section 4.8  of the  Summary of Product 
Characteristic (SmPC) but are not associated with  a relevant risk. 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even  serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable  in relation to the  severity of the indication 
treated: 
None. 
Known risks that  require no further characterisation and  are  followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely  through signal detection and adverse  reaction  reporting, and 
for which the  risk minimisation messages in the  product information are adhered to by 
prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each  EU Member  state 
where the  product is authorised): 
• 
Taste disturbance 
•  Headache 
•  Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting 
•  Abdominal pain upper 
• 
Fatigue 
•  Decreased appetite 
•  Weight decreased 
The most ‘common’ and ‘very common’ reported adverse reactio ns were taste disturbance; 
headache; diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting;  abdominal pain upper, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight 
decreased, and immunosuppressant drug concentration increased.  
All these events are listed in  Section 4.8  of the  SmPC but are not  a ssociated with  a relevant risk 
except for immunosuppressant drug concentration increased which is described below in SVII.1.2.  
Known risks that  do not impact the risk-benefit  profile 
If co-administration of LIVTENCITY with  other strong or moderate CYP3A in ducers (e.g., 
carbamazepine, efavirenz, phenobarbital and phenytoin) cannot be avoided, the LIVTENCITY dose 
should be increased to 1200 mg twice daily with  the exception of selected immunosuppressants,

rosuvastatin, and digoxin, concomitant  administration with  maribavir does not impact the  use or 
outcomes of a wide range of other drugs commonly administered in the  target patient population.  
Other  reasons for considering the risks not important: 
Drug-Drug Interaction with  statins:  In-vitro data showed that  maribavir is an inhibitor  of 
BCRP (IC50 = 7.05µM).  Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling results, 
concomitant administration of 400  mg BID maribavir with rosuvastatin, a sensitive BCRP substrate, 
is expected to increase rosuvastatin AUC by 2.15-  to 2.94-fold, and Cmax by 3.40-  to 4.97-fold. 
However, in  Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, there was no increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders 
when maribavir was concomitantly administered with  rosuvastatin or other commonly used statins in 
transplant patients  with CMV infections (Module.2.7.2).  Therefore, there is a possibility that PBPK 
may overpredict the in  vivo effect of maribavir on rosuvastatin PK. This is discussed in SmPC 
Section 4.4; Section 4.5; and Package leaflet. 
Drug-Drug Interaction with  digoxin: Maribavir is an in vitro inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P-gp) 
transporter. In a clinical study, co-administration of LIVTENCITY increased plasma concentrations of 
digoxin: increased AUC by 21% and Cmax by 25%.  Given the narrow therapeuti c window  of digoxin, 
caution should be exercised when LIVTENCITY and digoxin are co administered. Serum digoxin 
concentrations should be monitored, and dose of digoxin may need to be reduced, as needed.  (see 
Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC)  
SVII.1.2.  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety  concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified Risk 
Risk-benefit  impact 
Not  applicable.  
Important Potential  Risk 
Risk-benefit  impact 
Increased risk of serious adverse reactions due 
to an increase in immunosuppressant drug level 
During the clinical development program, it  was 
observed that concomitant administration  of 
maribavir with  tacrolimus resulted in increased 
tacrolimus Cmax and AUC by 33% and 54% 
respectively. Approximately 10% of subjects in 
the pivotal 303 Study showed this adverse 
event of special interest (AESI) and most AESI 
were mild to  moderate in severity. Thus, there 
is a potential to increase the drug 
concentrations of other immunosuppressants 
with  a narrow therapeutic window (including 
cyclosporine, sirolimus and everolimus). This 
DDI could result in toxicities from elevated 
immunosuppressant levels (for example, 
infections, worsening of renal function which 
may lead to acute renal failure in severe 
cases). The risk of DDI can be mitigated  by 
frequently monitoring of immunosuppressant 
drug levels throughout  treatment with 
maribavir, especially following initiation  and 
after discontinuation of maribavir and adjusting 
the dose as required. The post-authorisation 
safety profile will be evaluated through the 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.

Characterisation of the risk: 
Concomitant administration of maribavir with 
tacrolimus increases exposure to tacrolimus, 
and this is most likely due to inhibition  of 
CYP3A4 activity, P-glycoprotein or both. 
LIVTENCITY has the potential  to increase the 
drug concentrations of immunosuppressant 
drugs that are CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates 
with  narrow therapeutic ranges (including 
tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus and 
everolimus). In clinical trials, 
immunosuppressant drug level increase has 
been commonly reported while very few led to 
a serious adverse drug reaction. 
Maribavir is metabolized primarily in the liver 
and is a substrate of CYP 3A4 and the 
transport protein P- gp. In-vitro, maribavir is 
an inhibitor of P- gp (IC50 = 33.7  µM). 
A Phase 1 clinical study (Study 1263-105) 
conducted to evaluate the potential  of 
drug-drug interactions demonstrated the 
following: 
Concomitant administration of maribavir 
(400  mg BID) with tacrolimus, a substrate of 
CYP 3A4 and P- gp, resulted in increased 
tacrolimus Cmax and AUC by 33% and 54%, 
respectively. 
Administration of maribavir to healthy subjects 
indicated that  maribavir is not  a significant 
inhibitor  of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and is a weak 
inhibitor  of CYP2C19 and P-gp.

in immunosuppressant drug level 
SHP620-202 
In clinical study SHP620-202,  12/120  (10%) 
of all subjects who received maribavir 
experienced the adverse event of 
immunosuppressant drug level increased 
(ISDLI). The number (%) of subjects reporting 
this adverse event (AE) were 4 (10%), 
2 (5%),  and 6  (15%) in the  maribavir 400 mg 
BID, 800  mg BID, and 1200mg  BID groups, 
respectively. Eleven of these 12  subjects had 
events that  were considered by the 
investigator to be related to maribavir 
therapy. The majority of events were mild to 
moderate in intensity;  however, 3 subjects 
(1 subject in 800mg  BID group and 2 subjects 
in 1200  mg BID group) had events severe in 
intensity.  One treatment-emergent serious 
adverse event (SAE) of acute kidney injury 
secondary to increased tacrolimus levels was 
reported in the  subject who  was in 1200  mg 
BID group and the subject discontinued 
maribavir. 
SHP620-203 
In clinical study SHP620-203,  10/119  (8.4%) 
of all subjects treated with  maribavir 
experienced ISDLI. The incidence of this  event 
was 2/40 (5%),  2/40 (5%)  and 6/39 (15.4 %) 
in the 400  mg BID, 800 mg BID, and 1200  mg 
BID groups, respectively. This was not 
reported in the  valganciclovir cohort. This was 
reported as related with  2 dose cohorts 
(800  mg and 1200  mg) of maribavir in 
4/119  (3.4%). Four  subjects had events that 
were considered by the investigator to be 
related to  maribavir and this  included the 
2 subjects in the 1200  mg BID who had 
severe symptoms. One event led to drug 
interruption in  800 mg BID dose. Two subjects 
in the 1200  mg BID group experienced severe 
symptoms (cachexia and toxic encephalopathy 
in one subject and ISDLI in  the other subject). 
One treatment-emergent SAE of increasing 
tacrolimus levels was reported in the subject 
who was in 1200  mg BID group and the 
subject discontinued maribavir. 
SHP620-303 
The TEAE of ISDLI was reported in a higher 
proportion of subjects in the maribavir group 
(21/234, 9.0%)  compared to the 
investigator-assigned anti-CMV  treatment 
(IAT) group (1/116,  0.9%).  In

Important Potential  Risk: Increased risk of serious adverse reactions due to an increase 
in immunosuppressant drug level 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Preventability: 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the 
product: 
6% (14  subjects), this  TEAE was assessed as 
related to  treatment in maribavir group and 
none in IAT group. It was reported as a 
treatment-emergent serious adverse event 
(SAE) for 1 (0.4%)  maribavir-treated subject. 
Amongst the 21 maribavir-treated subjects 
who had increased ISDLI reported as a TEAE, 
19 subjects had tacrolimus concentration 
increased and 2 had sirolimus concentration 
increased. This TEAE was reported as severe 
for 2 subjects (tacrolimus), moderate for 
6 subjects (tacrolimus), and mild for 
13 subjects (11 for tacrolimus and 2  for 
sirolimus). Mean values of immunosuppressant 
drug levels varied across the study time points 
and did not show any consistent trends for 
increased immunosuppressant drug levels with 
maribavir treatment. 
It is likely that  AE of ISDLI is dose-dependent, 
and patient on the highest  doses of maribavir 
are at highest  risk for drug interaction 
between maribavir and ISD. As this  is a known 
interaction and has been formally studied, 
adjustment of the doses of ISD can be made. 
However, there is a need for more extensive 
monitoring of ISD concentration levels and 
potential for more frequent dose adjustments. 
Frequently monitor immunosuppressant drug 
(including  tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus 
and everolimus) levels throughout  treatment 
with  maribavir, especially following initiation 
and after discontinuation  of maribavir and 
adjust the dose, as needed. 
During the clinical development program, it 
was observed that concomitant administration 
of maribavir with CYP3A and/or P-gp substrate 
tacrolimus resulted in  increased tacrolimus 
Cmax and AUC by 33%  and 54%  respectively, 
thus there is a potential to increase the drug 
concentrations of other immunosuppressants 
with  a narrow therapeutic window (including 
tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus and 
everolimus). This DDI could result in toxicities 
(for example, infections, worsening of renal 
function which  may lead to acute renal failure 
in severe cases). The risk of DDI could be 
mitigated with  the provision of specific 
guidance concerning this  risk in label.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for LIVTENCITY (Maribavir) 
This is a summary of the  risk management plan (RMP)  for LIVTENCITY. The RMP details important 
risks of LIVTENCITY, how these risks can be minimised, and how more  information will be obtained 
about LIVTENCITY's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
LIVTENCITY's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how LIVTENCITY should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for LIVTENCITY should be read in the context of all this information 
including the  assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of LIVTENCITY's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
LIVTENCITY is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease that is 
refractory (with or without  resistance) to  one or more prior therapies, including  ganciclovir, 
valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet in adult patients  who have undergone a haematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). 
Further information about the  evaluation of LIVTENCITY’s benefits can be found in  LIVTENCITY’s 
EPAR, including  in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: LINK  TO THE  EPAR SUMMARY LANDING  PAGE. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of LIVTENCITY, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about  LIVTENCITY's risks, are outlined  below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients  and healthcare professionals ; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the  amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that  the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient  (e.g. with  or 
without  prescription) can help to  minimise its  risks. 
Together, these measures constitute  routine risk minimisation  measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken  as necessary. 
These measures constitute  routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that  may affect the safe use of LIVTENCITY is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of LIVTENCITY are risks that  need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that  the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with  the use of LIVTENCITY. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this  association has not bee n

II.B  Summary of important risks 
Important potential risk: Increased risk of serious adverse  reactions due to an  increase 
in immunosuppressant drug level 
Evidence for linking the risk to  the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
LIVTENCITY has the potential  to increase the drug 
concentrations of immunosuppressant drugs that are 
CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic 
ranges (including  tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus and 
everolimus). In clinical trials, immunosuppressant drug 
level increase has been commonly reported while very few 
led to a serious adverse drug reaction. 
It is likely that  this phenomenon is dose dependent, and 
patients on the highest  doses of maribavir are at highest 
risk for drug interactions when maribavir is administered 
concomitantly with  the immunosuppressant drug. 
Risk minimisation  measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4, Section 4.5, Section 4.8 and PL 
Section 2. 
The prescribers are informed of the potential for increased 
immunosuppressant drug levels (tacrolimus, sirolimus, 
everolimus, cyclosporine) while on maribavir therapy. The 
prescribers are advised to frequently monitor these 
immunosuppressant drug levels throughout  LIVTENCIT Y 
treatment, especially following initiation  and after 
discontinuation  of LIVTENCITY and adjust the 
immunosuppressant dose, as required. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None.

SHP620-302:  A Phase 3, Multicenter,  Randomized, Double-blind , Double-dummy, Active controlled 
Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Maribavir Compared to Valganciclovir for the Treatment of 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients. 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of maribavir to 
valganciclovir in CMV viremia clearance at the  end of Study Week 8 in asymptomatic CMV infection in 
HSCT recipients. A list of secondary objectives can be found in  Annex  2.    
Study number TBD (planned): Retrospective chart review study on safety outcomes associated with 
use of maribavir in patients  with  post-transplant refractory or resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infection and having end-stage renal disease (ESRD) including  patients on peritoneal dialysis or 
haemodialysis.    
Purpose of the study: Safety of maribavir in the treatment of patients  with CMV disease post -
transplant has been previously demonstrated, but the  effect of ESRD on maribavir safety remains 
unknown. Primary objective: Evaluate the known and potential safety risks for patients  treated with 
maribavir who also have end-stage renal disease including patients on peritoneal dialysis or 
haemodialysis.

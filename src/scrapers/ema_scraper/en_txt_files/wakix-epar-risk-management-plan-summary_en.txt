PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR WAKIX 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Wakix. The RMP details important 
risks of Wakix, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Wakix's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Wakix's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Wakix should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Wakix  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Wakix's 
RMP. 
Wakix has been approved in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and 
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
I The medicine and what it is used for 
Wakix is authorised in adult, adolescents and children from the age of 6 years for the treatment 
of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains pitolisant 
as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Wakix’s benefits can be found in Wakix’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage EPAR summary of Wakix  
II  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of  Wakix,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Wakix's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information  about adverse reactions  is collected continuously 
and regularly, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Wakix is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Wakix  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Wakix.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Identified risks 
Insomnia 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Insomnia has been reported commonly in clinical studies (in 
up  to  10  patients  in  100  treated  with  Wakix  mostly  at  dose 
from 18 to 36 mg per day). Most cases were mild to moderate. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No  specific  risk  group  was  identified  during  the  clinical 
development. The frequency of insomnia is higher in elderly.

of sleep disorders. 
Gastric disorders caused by hyperacidity 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Wakix  may  increase  the  stomach  acidity.  Gastric  disorders 
have  been  reported  commonly  (in  up  to  10  patients  in  100 
treated  with  Wakix)  during  clinical  studies.  However,  no 
stomach ulcers were reported. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No  specific  risk  group  was  identified  during  the  clinical 
development.  The  frequency  of  gastric  disorders  is  similar 
between gender and age.

Anxiety 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Anxiety and depression have been reported commonly (in up to 
10 patients in 100 treated with Wakix). Uncertainty remains on 
the  causal  association  between  the  risk  of  depression/anxiety 
and Wakix as psychiatric side effects are frequent comorbidities 
in narcolepsy. 
No specific risk group (age or gender) was identified during the 
clinical development. 
The  prevalence  of  moderate  to  severe  depression  /  anxiety 
ranged  from  15%  to  37%  in  the  narcoleptic  population 
(Vandeputte et al Sleep Med 2003). 
In  Harmony  III  study  (P09-10,  n  =  102  pitolisant-treated 
patients), 18 patients (17.6%) had medical history of depression 
or depressive syndrome at inclusion. Among them 9 (8.8%) had 
ongoing depression at study entry. These data are in accordance 
with the prevalence reported in the narcoleptic population.

Depression and suicidal ideation 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Anxiety and depression have been reported commonly (in up to 
10 patients in 100 treated with Wakix). Uncertainty remains on 
the  causal  association  between  the  risk  of  depression/anxiety 
and Wakix as psychiatric side effects are frequent comorbidities 
in narcolepsy. 
Suicidal  events  have  been  reported  in  non-interventional 
studies  (PASS  and  EAP  in  US)  with  an  incidence  between 
0.54% in the PASS and 0.30% in the EAP in US. 
No specific risk group (age or gender) was identified. 
The  prevalence  of  moderate  to  severe  depression  /  anxiety 
ranged  from  15%  to  37%  in  the  adolescent-adult  narcoleptic 
population (Vandeputte et al Sleep Med 2003) and about 25% 
of the narcoleptic children have been described with high levels 
of  depressive  symptoms  [Innocente  2014].  Incidence  of 
suicidal ideation is about 9 % in narcoleptic patient (Alasim et 
al, 2019). 
In  Harmony  III  study  (P09-10,  n  =  102  pitolisant-treated 
patients), 18 patients (17.6%) had medical history of depression 
or  depressive  syndrome  at  inclusion.  These  data  are  in 
accordance  with  the  prevalence  reported  in  the  narcoleptic 
population. 
In PASS (n=364) and in the EAP in US (n=622), 2 patients and 
3 patients, respectively reported suicidal events.

Potential risks 
Proconvulsive potentials 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Convulsions were reported at high doses in animal studies. In 
clinical trials, one case of worsening of epilepsy was reported 
in an epileptic patient. Caution is recommended in patients with 
severe epilepsy.

Misuse 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Because Wakix affects the central nervous system, there is a 
potential risk for drug abuse and misuse, drug dependence and 
rebound effect (when the symptoms come back after stopping 
treatment). 
Risk factors and risk groups

Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
No data on fertility are available in humans. Studies in animals 
have shown effect on semen parameters, without a significant 
impact on reproductive performance in males and reduction on 
the percentage of live foetuses in treated females.

Pregnancy 
There  are  no  data  on  the  use  of  Wakix  in  pregnant  women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including 
teratogenicity 
is  not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential  not  using  contraception.  Wakix  may  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  hormonal  contraceptives; 
therefore,  an 
alternative method of contraception should be used.  
Breastfeeding 
Animal studies have shown that pitolisant can pass into breast 
milk.  Therefore,  breastfeeding  is  contraindicated  during 
treatment with Wakix. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Childbearing potential women without effective contraceptive 
method.

Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Pitolisant  stimulates  wakefulness  via  the  brain  histamine 
system. All substances which block the brain histamine system 
could impair the effectiveness of Wakix. These include: 
antidepressants

QT-interval prolongation 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Pitolisant  produces  QT  prolongation  at  doses  higher  than  the 
therapeutic dose. In clinical trials, no effects on the heart were 
identified  at  therapeutic  doses.  Patients  with  heart  disease, 
treated with other QT-prolonging medicines or known to be at 
risk of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), treated with medicines 
that increase the amount of pitolisant in the blood or with severe 
kidney  or  moderate  liver  impairment  should  be  carefully 
monitored.

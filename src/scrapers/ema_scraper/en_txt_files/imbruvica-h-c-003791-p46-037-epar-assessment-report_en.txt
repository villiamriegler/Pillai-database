1.  Introduction 
On 21 Feb 2022, the MAH submitted data from an ongoing study for Imbruvica, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
These data are NOT submitted as part of a post-authorisation measure or specific obligation. 
Article 46 requires marketing-authorisation holders to submit information on studies conducted in 
children of authorised medicines that have been completed since the Paediatric Regulation came into 
force on 26 January 2007 and are sponsored by the marketing-authorisation holder. Information must 
be submitted within six months of completion of each study¨. 
The study of ibrutinib monotherapy in 19 Japanese patients with steroid dependent/refractory chronic 
GvHD s currently ongoing and included 1 (one) pediatric patient, who died during participation in 
study. No other pediatric patients will be enrolled, which prompted the MAH to submit the procedure 
ahead of time (i.e. no CSR). 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study GVH3001, a Phase 3 Study of the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor 
Ibrutinib in Subjects with Steroid Dependent/Refractory Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) is 
a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Ibrutinib monotherapy 420 mg qd. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a summary of findings from ongoing study GVH3001, a Phase 3 Study of the 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor Ibrutinib in Subjects with Steroid Dependent/Refractory 
Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study GVH3001 is an open-label, single arm study that was conducted in Japan only, to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and PK of single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg in Japanese subjects, ≥12 years of age with 
steroid dependent/refractory cGVHD.  
A total of 19 subjects including 18 adult subjects aged ≥18 years and 1 adolescent subject aged 13 
years with steroid dependent/refractory cGVHD were enrolled in this study.  
Subjects received a maximum of 420 mg of ibrutinib once daily unless they had intervening 
unacceptable toxicity or met other criteria for subject discontinuation.  
The primary endpoint of this study is overall response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response 
[PR]).

Although Study GVH3001 is ongoing, no new pediatric data will become available during the remainder 
of the study, as the 1 adolescent subject (13 yo) enrolled in the study died of multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome possibly ibrutinib-related before the reported data cut-off in 2020.  
2.3.3.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Venous blood samples were collected to determine plasma concentration of ibrutinib and the 
metabolite PCI-45227. The plasma concentration data of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 were used to 
determine PK parameters by noncompartmental method based on actual sampling times. Only one 
adolescent subject was included in the study. Due to the limited data in children, no conclusions on the 
paediatric population can be drawn.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. No changes in labelling.

1.  Introduction 
On 2 June 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tobramycin inhalation powder, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
The MAH states that the efficacy and safety data from study CTBM100CUS03 do not warrant an update 
of the product information of TOBI Podhaler. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  CTBM100CUS03,  A  24-week,  open-label,  parallel-group,  interventional 
Phase  IV  study  comparing  Tobramycin  Inhalation  Powder  (TIP)  administered  once  daily  continuously 
versus  TIP  administered  BID  in  28  day  on  /  28  day  off  cycles  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis, is a stand alone study. 
The study was not listed in the TOBI Podhaler PIP (EMEA-000184-PIP01-08-M02).  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The dose was 112 mg tobramycin (4x 28mg capsules), administered once daily continuously or twice 
daily for 28 days followed by 28 days off treatment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study  CTBM100CUS03,  A  24-week,  open-label,  parallel-group,  interventional  Phase  IV  study 
comparing  Tobramycin  Inhalation  Powder  (TIP)  administered  once  daily  continuously  versus 
TIP  administered  BID  in  28  day  on  /  28  day  off  cycles  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in patients with cystic fibrosis. 
A total of 32 patients were randomized of which there were 3 paediatric patients.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CTBM100CUS03, A 24-week, open-label, parallel-group, interventional Phase IV study 
comparing  Tobramycin  Inhalation  Powder  (TIP)  administered  once  daily  continuously 
versus TIP administered BID in 28 day on / 28 day off cycles for the treatment of pulmonary 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in patients with cystic fibrosis. 
Description 
This  open-label,  parallel-group,  interventional  phase  IV  study  was  a  24  weeks  study  comparing  TIP 
administered once daily on a continuous (i.e., non-cycled) basis, versus TIP administered twice daily in 
28 day on / 28 day off cycles for the treatment of pulmonary P. aeruginosa  in patients 6 years or older

day off cycles. 
To  estimate  the  difference  in  time  to  first  use,  incidence  of  use,  and  duration  of  use  of  an 
antipseudomonal  antibiotic  (overall,  oral,  intravenous)  other  than  prophylactic  treatment 
planned  before  enrolment,  through  Day  168  (Visit  9)  in  patients  receiving  TIP  112  mg  once 
daily (continuous) vs TIP 112 mg BID in 28 day on / 28 day off cycles. 
Study design 
This study consisted of a screening visit (Visit 1) and 8 follow-up visits (Visits 2-9). The screening visit 
(Visit  1)  could  take  place  any  time  within  28  days  prior  to  study  drug  administration  (Visit  2).  If  the 
patient had previously received inhaled aminoglycoside for P. aeruginosa , initiation of study drug could 
only occur if at least 28 days had elapsed since the patient’s last dose of inhaled aminoglycoside.

Upon  randomization,  patients  were  assigned  to  receive  either  TIP  four  28-mg  capsules  (112  mg) 
administered once daily on a continuous (i.e., non-cycled) basis or TIP four 28-mg capsules (112 mg) 
administered  twice  daily  in  28  day  on  /  28  day  off  cycles;  each  cycle  consisted  of  a  28-day  on-
treatment  period  followed  by  a  28-day  off-treatment  period.  The  duration  of  study  duration  was  168 
days (24 weeks). 
Study population 
The study population consisted of males and females >6 years of age who had a confirmed diagnosis 
of  cystic  fibrosis.  At  screening,  patients  were  required  to  have  FEV1  ≥25%  and  ≤  80%  of  normal 
predicted  values  for  age,  sex,  and  height.  In  addition,  patients  were  required  to  have  chronic  P. 
aeruginosa  infection in their respiratory tracts. As such, P. aeruginosa  was required to be present in a 
sputum/deep  cough  throat  swab  culture  or  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)  within  6  months  prior  to 
screening and in the sputum/deep-throat cough swab culture at screening. 
Sample size 
Enrolment of 200 patients was planned. A total of 32 patients were randomized, 16 to each treatment 
group. A total of 5 patients completed the study, and 6 patients were discontinued before the sponsor 
ended  the  study.  The  remaining  21  patients  were  discontinued  due  to  the  sponsor’s  decision  to 
terminate the study prematurely. The 31 patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
were  included  in  the  Safety  and  Full  Analysis  Sets,  16  in  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous)  treatment 
group and 15 in the TIP BID (cycled) treatment group. 
CHMP comment 
The study was terminated prematurely due to recruitment problems. As a result, the planned sample 
size  was  far  from  reached  and  only  5  subjects  completed  the  study.  No  conclusions  can  be  drawn 
based on these few subjects.   
Treatments 
For both treatment arms, each dose was four 28-mg capsules (112 mg) of tobramycin dry powder for 
inhalation  administered  by  the  T-326  Inhaler  for  168  days  (24  weeks).  Patients  were  randomized  to 
one of the following two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio: 
• 
• 
TIP once daily (continuous) treatment group: A total daily dose of 112 mg administered once 
daily in the morning on a continuous (ie, non-cycled) basis. 
TIP BID (cycled) treatment group: A total daily dose of 224 mg administered BID in 28-day on 
/ 28-day off cycles (a total of three 56-day cycles). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted. The primary analysis 
time point was at Day 168 (Visit 9). The following secondary efficacy variables were planned: 
1. Percent change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted 
2. Percent change from baseline in FVC % predicted 
3. Percent change from baseline in FEF25-75 % predicted 
4. Change from baseline in P. aeruginosa  sputum density 
5. Time to first hospitalization due to respiratory-related events

6. Hospitalization due to respiratory-related events 
7. Length of hospital stay due to respiratory-related events 
8. Time to first usage of anti-pseudomonal antibiotic 
9. Usage of anti-pseudomonal antibiotic 
10.Duration of use of anti-pseudomonal antibiotic 
Safety assessments consisted of physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, audiology 
testing (at selected sites), adverse event assessments, acute change in airway reactivity (FEV1 percent 
predicted) from pre-dose to 30 minutes after completion of first dose of study drug (where a relative 
change  of  20%  or  more  is  considered  a  clinically  significant  change  indicating  bronchospasm), 
inhalation-associated cough rate, and use of concomitant medications/significant nondrug therapies. 
Statistical Methods 
Due  to  the  premature  termination  of  the  study  and  the  reduction  in  patient  data,  many  of  the 
summaries and analyses planned in the protocol were eliminated in the statistical analysis plan prior to 
database lock. Data were summarized descriptively and no inferential analysis was provided. For safety 
analysis, only adverse events were summarized. Descriptive statistics for the primary efficacy variable 
and  secondary  efficacy  variable  1  were  provided.  All  the  data  collected  in  the  CRF  were  provided  as 
listings. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  32  patients  were  randomized,  16  to  each  treatment  group.  A  total  of  5  patients  completed 
the  study,  and  6  patients  were  discontinued  before  the  sponsor  ended  the  study.  The  remaining  21 
patients  were  discontinued  due  to  the  sponsor’s  decision  to  terminate  the  study  prematurely  due  to 
poor recruitment (listed under “Administrative problems” in the table below).

Patient  0503-00006  was  randomized  to  the  TIP  BID  (cycled)  treatment  group,  but  never  received 
study medication, and was excluded from the Safety and Full Analysis Sets. The 31 remaining patients 
received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the Safety and Full Analysis Sets. 
There  were  3  paediatric  patients  enrolled.  One  patient  (13  years  old,  female,  Caucasian)  was 
randomized  to  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous)  group,  and  two  patients  (14  years  old,  female, 
Caucasian; 10 years old, male, Caucasian) were randomized to the TIP twice daily (cycled) group. All 3 
paediatric  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  the  sponsor’s  decision  to  terminate  the  study 
prematurely. 
Baseline data 
Patients  ranged  from  10  to  74  years  of  age.  The  mean  age  was  slightly  higher  in  the  TIP  once  daily 
(continuous) treatment group (34.9 years) than in the TIP BID (cycled) treatment group (26.5 years) 
and the proportion of males was also  higher (62.5% vs. 50%,  respectively). All but 2 of  the patients 
were  Caucasian.  The  two  treatment  groups  were  similar  at  baseline;  mean  FEV1  %  predicted  was 
54.5%  in  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous)  treatment  group  and  57.3%  in  the  TIP  BID  (cycled) 
treatment group. 
Efficacy results 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted. The primary analysis 
time point was at Day 168 (Visit 9). The two treatment groups were similar at baseline; mean FEV1 % 
predicted  was  54.5%  in  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous)  treatment  group  and  57.3%  in  the  TIP  twice 
daily (cycled) treatment group. Only 5 patients had spirometry at Visit 9 and there are no meaningful 
results. Changes over time and differences between the two treatment groups could not be adequately 
assessed, as these observations were limited by the small and decreasing sample size over the study 
period. 
As  with  the  absolute  changes  in  FEV1  %  predicted,  assessment  of  between-group  differences  for  the 
secondary efficacy variables could not be adequately assessed, as these observations were limited by 
the small and decreasing sample size over the study period. 
CHMP comment 
It is agreed with the MAH that no meaningful results or conclusions can be generated based on only 5 
subjects.

Safety results 
The overall duration of exposure ranged from 6 to 167 days, with an overall mean of 74.3 days and a 
median of 84 days. 
No deaths were reported in this study. 
The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the TIP once daily (continuous) treatment group 
(81.3%) and TIP twice daily (cycled) treatment group (80.0%). The most commonly affected primary 
system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  were  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (primarily  cough, 
dyspnoea,  and  oropharyngeal  pain),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (primarily  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea, 
and  nausea),  and  infections  and  infestations  (primarily  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  cystic 
fibrosis).  
A total of 4 patients experienced hospitalizations that were considered serious adverse events. All were 
worsening  pre-existing  conditions;  3  patients  with  worsening  cystic  fibrosis  and  1  patient  with 
worsening endometriosis. None of the SAEs was suspected to be related to study treatment. 
Three  patients  experienced  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  all  in  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous) 
treatment  group.  One  patient  experienced  mildly  decreased  hearing  at  0.25  kHz  on  Day  15  and 
permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  this  AE,  although  the  investigator  did  not  suspect 
that  the  AE  was  related  to  study  drug.  A  second  patient  experienced  mild  dose-related  coughing  on 
Day  2  and  permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  this  AE.  The  third  patient  experienced 
mild non-cardiac chest tightness on Day 7 and permanently discontinued study treatment due to this 
AE. Both of these AEs were suspected to be related to study drug. 
No  audiologic  impairment  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  was  observed.  No  worsening  in 
renal function was reported.  
A  total  of  14  patients,  7  in  each  treatment  group,  experienced  a  cough  during  inhalation  at  one  or 
more  visits.  A  total  of  11  patients,  6  in  the  TIP  once  daily  (continuous)  group  and  5  in  the  TIP  twice 
daily (cycled) group, experienced a cough within 5 minutes after inhalation at one or more visits. Most 
of the coughing occurred within 15 seconds after inhalation. One patient was treated with albuterol to 
reduce coughing. 
Paediatric patients 
There were 3 paediatric patients enrolled in the study, each of whom discontinued the study due to the 
sponsor’s decision to terminate the study prematurely. There is no safety or efficacy data presented or 
summarized specifically for these patients in the clinical study report. Therefore, the individual patient 
listings were reviewed and are discussed below: 
13-year-old female in the TIP once daily (continuous) group: 
The patient discontinued on Day 84 of the study. 
Cough  was  reported  as  an  AE  three  times  for  this  patient.  The  cough  was  experienced  either  during 
inhalation or post inhalation of TIP. The cough was mild in all cases, no action was taken, and it was 
suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  Increased  coughing  was  also  reported  once.  The  increased 
coughing was mild, no action was taken and it was suspected to be related to study drug. 
Aphonia and oropharyngeal pain were each reported once for this patient. These AEs were mild, non-
drug  therapy  was  given,  and  they  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  Constipation  and 
abdominal  pain  were  each  reported  once  for  this  patient.  These  AEs  were  mild.  A  concomitant 
medication was given for the constipation and no action was taken for the abdominal pain. They were 
not suspected to be related to study drug.

There were no clinically significant changes in haematology, chemistry, or urinary laboratory values in 
this patient. 
In terms of efficacy, pre-dose relative change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted ranged from +5.0% 
to  +15.0%  during  visits  prior  to  discontinuation.  At the  discontinuation  visit,  the  relative  change  was 
0.0%. 
14-year-old female in the TIP twice daily (cycled) group: 
The patient discontinued on Day 85 of the study. 
Cough  was  reported  as  an  AE  four  times  for  this  patient.  The  cough  was  mild  in  all  cases,  no  action 
was taken, and it was suspected to be related to study drug. 
Increased  coughing,  increased  sputum  production,  dyspnoea,  and  wheezing  were  each  reported  once 
during  the  same  37-day  time  frame.  These  AEs  were  moderate,  and  concomitant  medication  was 
given. They were not suspected to be related to study drug. 
Post-tussive vomiting was reported twice for this patient. This AE was mild in both cases, and no action 
was taken. It was suspected to be related to study drug in one of the two cases. 
Constipation was reported once for this patient. This AE was moderate, and a concomitant medication 
was  given.  It  was  not  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  Diarrhoea  was  reported  once  for  this 
patient. This AE was moderate, and no action was taken. It was not suspected to be related to study 
drug. 
There were no clinically significant changes in haematology, chemistry, or urinary laboratory values in 
this patient. 
In cycle 1 (Visit 4), at the end of the on-treatment period, the mean FEV1 % predicted showed a pre-
dose relative change from baseline of +19.0%. In cycle 2 (Visit 6 and the discontinuation visit for this 
patient),  at  the  end  of  the  on-treatment  period,  the  mean  FEV1  %  predicted  showed  a  pre-dose 
relative change from baseline of +16.0%. 
10-year-old male in the TIP twice daily (cycled) group: 
The patient discontinued on Day 35 of the study. 
Increased  coughing  was  reported  as  an  AE  twice  for  this  patient.  In  one  case,  this  AE  was  mild,  no 
action  was  taken,  and  it  was  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  In  the  second  case,  this  AE  was 
moderate, no action was taken, and it was not suspected to be related to study drug. 
Rhonchi were reported twice for this patient. In both cases, this AE was mild, no action was taken, and 
it was not suspected to be related to study drug. 
There were no clinically significant changes in haematology, chemistry, or urinary laboratory values in 
this patient. 
In  cycle  1  (Visit  3),  during  the  on-treatment  period,  the  mean  FEV1  %  predicted  showed  a  predose 
relative  change  from  baseline  of  +25.0%.  At  the  discontinuation  visit  (Day  35),  the  mean  FEV1  % 
predicted showed a pre-dose relative change from baseline of -2.0%. 
CHMP comment  
No  new  safety  signals  are  identified  from  this  small  study,  neither  in  adults  nor  in  the  3  paediatric 
patients enrolled in the study.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The main objectives of the study, changes over time in lung function and differences in lung function 
between the two treatment groups could not be adequately assessed, due to the small and decreasing 
sample size over the study period.  
There were no new or unexpected safety findings overall or from the 3 paediatric patients enrolled in 
this  study.  The  safety  results  observed  in  this  study  were  generally  consistent  with  the  known 
established safety profile of TIP. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
It is agreed  with the MAH that the product information of TOBI Podhaler does not warrant an update 
based on the results from study CTBM100CUS03. 
Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

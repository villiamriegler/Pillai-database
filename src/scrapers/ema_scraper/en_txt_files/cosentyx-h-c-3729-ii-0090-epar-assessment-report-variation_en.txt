2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also called ‘acne inversa’ or ‘maladie de Verneuil,’ is a painful, chronic, 
recurrent and debilitating inflammatory skin condition of the pilosebaceous follicle with an underlying 
immune system imbalance that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals.  
The therapeutic indication initially claimed by the MAH was: 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) in 
adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. 
The initially proposed dose regimen was: 
The recommended dose is 300 mg of secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg every 2 weeks. Each 300 mg dose is 
given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Although epidemiological prevalence estimates vary widely (0.03% to 4.0%) and geographical differences 
exist, a prevalence of approximately 0.1% to 1% is accepted by the scientific community. The disease 
starts after puberty, and women are more frequently affected than men in a ratio of 3:1. Risk factors 
include obesity and smoking. 
Clinical presentation 
HS typically presents with painful, deep, inflammatory lesions, mostly inflammatory nodules and 
abscesses, which progressively scar and suppurate and lead to malodorous discharge in the apocrine 
gland-bearing parts of the body. Inflammatory lesions are complicated during disease progression by 
sinus tract formation and fistulisation and may lead to hypertrophic scarring with a possible impact on 
function. The most common areas affected are the axillae, the groin and the anogenital region. HS has a 
highly negative impact on QoL and devastating psychological effects, with an impact greater than for 
many other dermatologic diseases. Patients with HS also often suffer from depression, social isolation, 
impaired sexual health and difficulty performing work duties.  
Management 
European treatment guidelines for HS were developed in 2015, followed by North American clinical 
management guidelines in 2019. These guidelines recommend a variety of medical treatments that can 
be used to manage the disease, including topical and systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapies, retinoids, 
systemic immunomodulators and biologics. Recurrent combination therapy using multiple antimicrobials 
represents the first step to control the symptoms in patients with HS. However, it is recognised that HS is 
not an infectious disease, but rather a chronic inflammatory condition, with elevated systemic levels of 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 9/158 
 
 
 
 
inflammatory markers. Therefore, systemic anti-inflammatory agents could be considered a more 
appropriate therapeutic strategy than antibiotics. Once irreversible fibrosis occurs, medical treatment can 
only control some symptoms, while the only option to manage fibrotic lesions is surgery. Currently, 
adalimumab (Humira), an anti-TNF-α antibody, is the only biological therapy approved for the treatment 
of adults with moderate to severe HS (approval granted in 2015 in the US and EU). Two similarly 
designed Phase 3 studies demonstrated the superiority of weekly adalimumab over placebo with respect 
to Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at Week 12: 41.8% adalimumab vs. 26.0% 
placebo in PIONEER I, and 58.9% adalimumab vs. 27.6% placebo in PIONEER II. However, considering 
the very limited treatment armamentarium, an unmet need exists for additional systemic therapies. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Secukinumab (AIN457, Cosentyx) is a recombinant, fully human monoclonal anti-human interleukin 
(IL)-17A antibody of the IgG1/κ-class. Secukinumab binds to human IL-17A and neutralises the 
bioactivity of this proinflammatory cytokine. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) was initially authorised in the EU 
on 15 Jan 2015 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis (PsO) in adult patients. New indications for psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-
axSpA;), PsO in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years, and the juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(JIA) categories of enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) in children and 
adolescents from the age of 6 years) were authorised. According to the MAH, secukinumab is currently 
authorised in over 100 countries worldwide. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice related to the following aspects of the proposed clinical programme was provided by the 
CHMP in October 2017 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1281/4/2017/II): 
• 
• 
Proposed patient population 
Primary and secondary endpoints 
•  Study design 
•  Size of safety database 
•  Overall sufficiency of proposed programme. 
The MAH has generally followed recommendations provided in the Scientific Advice. Compliance and 
deviations from the scientific advice are discussed in relevant sections of the report.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has also 
provided a statement confirming that all clinical trials conducted outside of the European Union meet the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the current CHMP guideline on environmental risk assessment (CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), 
for products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids 
as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA 
studies, e.g., due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. As a 
monoclonal antibody, secukinumab falls within the scope of this provision. The MAH’s ERA, providing a 
justification for not performing a detailed environmental risk assessment for secukinumab, is thereby 
considered acceptable. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From the non-clinical point of view, the extension of indication application is considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients was investigated after 
treatment of secukinumab 300 mg s.c. every two weeks (Q2W) or every four weeks (Q4W). Blood 
samples were collected pre-dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis at the scheduled visits (pre-dose at 
baseline, week 16, week 24, week 52, week 60). Secukinumab concentrations were listed by treatment 
and subject and Cmin were determined. Descriptive summary statistics were reported. An ELISA method 
was used for the bioanalytical analysis of secukinumab in serum, with a lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) of 160 ng/ml. 
Steady state levels were observed for both the Q2W and Q4W groups at Weeks 24 and 52 for subjects

who started secukinumab treatment at the beginning of the study (Table 1). The Q2W groups were 
already at steady state or close to steady state at Week 16 in studies M2301 and M2302. Steady state is 
reached at Week 24 in the Q4W groups. (Figure 1) 
Subjects who switched from placebo to Q2W at Week 16 showed concentrations already close to steady 
state at Week 24, i.e., eight weeks after start of treatment. Subjects who switched from placebo to Q4W 
at Week 16 showed higher concentrations at Week 24 than later at steady state. (Table 1)

Population PK analysis 
Population PK analysis was conducted on a pooled dataset comprising several PsO studies (A2102, A2103, 
A2211, A2212, A2220, A2302, A2303, A2308, A2310, A2311 and A2324) and the two pivotal HS Phase 3 
studies M2301 and M2302. 
A previously developed linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption for the 
subcutaneous (SC) administration and constant rate infusion for the intravenous (IV) administration was 
re–run on the present dataset and parameters were re-estimated. Covariates such as baseline body 
weight, population (paediatric versus adult), indication (HS versus PsO) and, in HS patients only – 
concomitant use of antibiotics, baseline disease severity (Hurley stage [I, II and III]) and baseline C-
reactive protein (CRP) levels were evaluated to select a final population PK model. The full model with 
backward deletion approach was utilized for covariate modelling, and the backward deletion was 
performed at the p=0.001 significance level. A total of 20265 secukinumab concentrations (on average, 5 
per subject) from 3787 PsO and HS patients were included in the population PK analysis. The parameter 
estimates of the final population PK model are presented in Table 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 14/158 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Parameter Estimates of Final Population PK Model 
In the population PK analysis, it was found that 
•  Observed concentrations in HS subjects were lower when compared to PsO subjects (Figure 2). 
The population PK analysis estimated a 23% decrease in the average concentration at steady 
state (Cavg,ss) between HS and PsO subjects with the same bodyweight. This decreased drug 
exposure was attributed to an increase in clearance of 30% (0.257 L/d in HS compared to 0.198 
L/d in PsO). 
•  No effect of concomitant use of antibiotics on drug exposure in HS subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 15/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The  observed  secukinumab  concentrations  for  HS  subjects  with  high  hsCRP  baseline  value  were 
lower compared to subjects with low hsCRP baseline value (Figure 3). The population PK analysis 
estimated the difference as 10% lower Cavg,ss for subjects with same bodyweight, same disease 
severity and twice higher hsCRP value at baseline. 
The observed concentrations were lower in severe HS subjects (Hurley stage III) when compared 
to moderate and less severe subjects (Hurley stages I and II) (Figure 4). The population PK 
analysis estimated a 15% lower Cavg,ss in Hurley stage III subjects when compared to Hurley 
stages I and II subjects with the same bodyweight and same hsCRP value at baseline. The 
exposure decrease was attributed to the increase in clearance of 18% (0.284 L/day in HS 
subjects with Hurley stage III compared to 0.241 L/day in HS subjects with Hurley stages I and 
II). 
• 
The  terminal  half-life  (T1/2)  for  the  overall  HS  population  was  estimated  to  be  23  days  with 
an inter-patient variability of 41%. 
When combining baseline hsCRP and disease severity effects, the population PK analysis estimated the 
extent of difference to: 
•  25% lower Cavg,ss for Hurley stage III subjects with hsCRP baseline value of 11 mg/L (subgroup 
median) compared to Hurley stages I and II subjects with hsCRP baseline value of 5 mg/L 
(subgroup median). 
•  50% lower Cavg,ss for Hurley stage III subjects with hsCRP baseline value of 37 mg/ (subgroup 
75% quantile) compared to Hurley stage I and II subjects with hsCRP baseline value of 2 mg/L 
(subgroup 25% quantile).

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-responses analyses were performed on the two pivotal HS Phase 3 studies M2301 and M2302. 
Exposure-response analyses were cross sectional in nature, and performed at relevant time points 
(Weeks 16, 24, 40 and 52). 
The Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis included PK and efficacy data from the two HS studies (M2301 and 
M2302). The following efficacy endpoints were considered: Primary endpoint HiSCR50 (HS Clinical

50% response (AN50), Absolute and percentage change from baseline in AN count, Hidradenitis 
Suppurativa-Physician’s Global Assessment (HS-PGA) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI-PRO). 
A total of 1042 HS patients contributed to the E-R analysis. Of note, the analyses did not take into 
account for difference in response rate at Week 4 despite the same loading regimen over the first four 
weeks between the two regimens. The models are considered to be for descriptive purposes only (as a 
smoother) and interpretation restricted to the visual appearance of the exposure response curves. Model-
estimated parameters such as EC50 are not reported and are not used to draw conclusions. 
The analyses were performed on all subjects as well as in subgroups defined based on concomitant use of 
antibiotics, previous exposure to biologics, baseline disease status (Hurley stages I and II versus stage 
III), body weight (<90 kg versus >90 kg), study and dose regimen. 
The analyses were performed on: 
•  Binary endpoints: HiSCR50 response, NRS30 response, AN50 response and flares. 
•  Continuous  endpoints:  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  AN  count,  percentage  change  from 
baseline in AN count, HS-PGA and DLQI total score. 
Exposure metrics presented here were predicted using the population PK model at different time points: 
•  Average cumulative exposure (Cavg,cum) from time 0 to time of efficacy assessment at Week 16 
•  Average  exposure  at  steady  state  over  a  dosing  interval  (Cavg,ss)  for  the  exposure  response 
assessment at Week 52. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint HiSCR50, the exposure-response analysis at Week 16 showed a small 
benefit of Q2W over Q4W mainly due to the large overlap of exposure. At the individual level, the analysis 
showed an incremental benefit for subjects achieving high exposure compared to low exposure (Figure 
5). The benefit of being exposed to secukinumab levels achieved by the Q2W regimen became more 
prominent over time beyond Week 16 (response rate increase of approximately 5.4% at Week 52 for 
Q2W compared to Q4W based on median exposure) compared to the Q4W regimen (Figure 6). The 
plateau achieved at high exposure (Figure 6) indicates no additional clinical benefit in increasing the 
dose strength or the frequency of administration beyond 300 mg Q2W. 
Similar conclusions hold when stratifying by the different subgroups mentioned above. In particular, 
exposure-response analysis for HiSCR50 demonstrated similar relationships between light subjects 
(<90 kg) and heavy subjects (≥90 kg) at Week 16 (Figure 7) and Week 52 (Figure 8) indicating the 
consistent benefit of Q2W over Q4W for light and heavy subjects. Figure 9 shows the HiSCR50 response 
rates as a function of exposure, stratified by baseline disease severity (Hurley stage).

For the secondary efficacy endpoint NRS30 (pain), the exposure-response analysis at Week 16 showed 
a small benefit of Q2W over Q4W mainly due to the large overlap of exposure. At the individual level, it 
showed an incremental benefit for subjects achieving high exposure compared to low exposure (Figure 
10). The benefit of being exposed to secukinumab levels achieved by the Q2W dose regimen became 
more prominent over time beyond Week 16 (approximately 6.0% higher at Week 52 for Q2W based on 
median exposure) compared to the Q4W dose regimen (Figure 11). 
Similar conclusions hold when stratifying by the different subgroups mentioned above for the sensitivity 
analyses indicating that the benefit of Q2W over Q4W was consistent across subgroups. In particular, the 
exposure-response relationship between light subjects (<90 kg) and heavy subjects (≥90 kg) at Week 16 
(Figure 12) and Week 52 (Figure 13) showed consistent benefit of Q2W over Q4W for light-weight 
subjects and heavy-weight subjects.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has collected sparse trough PK samples from all patients at baseline and weeks 16, 24, 52 and 
60. The trough secukinumab concentrations observed in HS patients are lower than the trough 
concentrations observed in earlier clinical studies in psoriatic patients. Moreover, the MAH has conducted 
population PK modelling on the basis of 11 PsO studies and the two pivotal HS phase 3 studies. The 
population PK modelling suggested that the clearance of secukinumab is higher in HS patients, and that 
patients with severe baseline disease have yet higher clearance than patients with less severe baseline 
disease. 
The bioanalytical method was identical to methods used in other indications except for LLOQ, which was 
updated from 80 ng/ml to 160 ng/ml due to observed plate effect at 80 ng/ml. The plate effect was not 
observed at 160 ng/ml and the measured samples with results between 80 ng/ml and 160 ng/ml were 
remeasured. The change in the LLOQ had no effect on the PK results. 
Secukinumab concentrations after 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen were twice as high as after 300 mg QW4 
in HS patients, indicating linear PK. 
The population PK model was based on previous modelling performed with data from PsO patients. This is 
considered appropriate. The model diagnostics (goodness of fit plots; prediction-corrected visual 
predictive check; plots of clearance random effects versus covariates) did not show signs of model 
misspecification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 27/158 
 
 
 
 
 
The population PK model only considered the possibility that HS patients might have lower trough 
concentrations because of increased clearance and did not consider the possibility that the lower trough 
concentrations might be a result of lower bioavailability. However, given the sparsity of PK data in HS 
patients, it is unlikely that population PK modelling could statistically identify whether the low trough 
concentrations in HS patients result from alterations in clearance or bioavailability. Moreover, alterations 
in clearance seem more likely since inflammatory status has been identified in the scientific literature to 
correlate with monoclonal antibody clearance (ref: https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fpsp4.12224). Finally, even 
if the low trough concentrations in HS patients were caused by a bioavailability difference and not 
a clearance difference, it would not change the overall conclusions on suitability of the proposed dosing 
regimen. Therefore, the issue of potential secukinumab bioavailability differences in HS patients was not 
pursued by the CHMP. 
Population PK modelling suggested that antibiotics have no interactions with secukinumab, however the 
conclusions are limited by the sparsity of PK sampling. Antibiotics contain a large group of different drugs, 
and antibiotic use was only tested as a dichotomous yes/no variable; this ignores differences between 
antibiotics, and also ignores the duration and dose level of antibiotics. As such, the conclusions reached 
by the current analysis are limited. No SmPC changes with regard to antibiotics DDI potential are 
proposed by the MAH, and this is supported by the CHMP. 
The exposure-response analyses were cross-sectional in nature, which means that the analyses were 
conducted independently at several timepoints, without considering that the responses might be 
correlated over time. This is a limitation. It would be relevant to consider the correlation between 
responses over time because the response rates at week 4 were higher for the Q4W group than for the 
Q2W group. This suggests that for one reason or another, the Q4W group subjects may have been more 
sensitive to respond to secukinumab. If this is the case, then between-group imbalances may obfuscate 
the exposure-response relationships, because the currently conducted analyses do not consider 
correlations between responses over time. The MAH attempted to fit longitudinal PK/PD model of subject 
specific HiSCR50 response profiles over time (which would take into account that the responses may 
correlate over time), however such a model could not be robustly estimated. While it is acknowledged 
that fitting a longitudinal PK/PD model to a single dichotomous response variable may not be feasible, it 
seems possible that a longitudinal PK/PD latent variable model of all primary and secondary endpoints 
could have been successful in describing the data. There are examples of longitudinal item response 
theory models which could have been adapted to the current dataset (see e.g., 
https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12601). However, such a model is not strictly necessary in order to 
evaluate the benefit-risk of secukinumab in HS patients, therefore, this issue was not pursued, and the 
MAH was not requested for additional exposure-response modelling efforts. 
Given that there is between-subject variability in secukinumab PK and given that previous PK-PD analyses 
in psoriatic patients have indicated high between-subject variability in the concentrations required to elicit 
a therapeutic response, the MAH was requested to further justify the benefit of starting with Q2W dosing, 
instead of starting with Q4W dosing with the option to titrate to Q2W dosing on the basis of treatment 
response. In response, the MAH has modified the posology in patients with moderate and severe 
hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and proposed a dose-escalation strategy. The recommended dose in HS 
patients is 300 mg of secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 
4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the maintenance dose can be 
increased to 300 mg every 2 weeks. 
The proposed SmPC section 5.2 changes (addition of information on absorption and elimination) are 
acceptable.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package supports the extension of indication to HS patients and the proposed 
dosing frequency Q4W after the initial four weekly injections and the possibility to increase the dosing 
Q2W based on clinical response is acceptable from the pharmacokinetic point of view.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No separate dose response studies were conducted. The MAH justified dose selection for the main studies 
on the following grounds: 
Rationale for 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks regimen 
Secukinumab 300 mg Q4W is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe 
plaque PsO, an inflammatory dermatological disease affecting the superficial layers of the skin and with 
moderate inflammatory burden. Considering the involvement of the Th17-related pathways in HS, and 
the positive clinical efficacy demonstrated by this secukinumab dose regimen in case reports in subjects 
with HS, the inhibition of IL-17A via secukinumab 300 mg Q4W was expected to provide a positive 
benefit-risk in moderate to severe HS patients, justifying further evaluation. 
This dose regimen is in line with the authorised posology in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and 
initial information from case reports showed a positive clinical response with this regimen in HS. 
Rationale for 300 mg s.c. every 2 weeks regimen 
Secukinumab 300 mg Q2W was evaluated to achieve a higher exposure for the following reasons: 
•  Secukinumab systemic exposure varies with body weight in an allometric relationship. For 
clearance, the allometric exponent was estimated to be close to 1; in other words, a doubling of 
body weight could lead to a nearly 2-fold increase in clearance and, therefore, reduced serum 
exposure. Since higher body weights were expected in HS than in PsO (approximately 10 kg 
heavier weight in clinical trials), HS may require a dose regimen with higher exposure than that 
resulting from the marketed regimen. 
•  Higher exposure than in PsO might be needed due to nature of HS lesions which are deeper in the 
dermis and more inflamed. 
• 
Feedback from the medical community and the experts included in the HS program Steering 
Committee advised the evaluation of a higher dose regimen due to the severe and progressive 
nature of the disease and the well-described diagnostic delay leading to patients presenting to 
medical care in advanced states. Moreover, the clinical experience with adalimumab in HS 
confirmed the need of a dose regimen with higher exposure to treat this patient population. 
At the time of the study initiation, the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W dose regimen had been tested in over 
300 subjects for at least 24 weeks in completed clinical studies in uveitis and PsO. Moreover, after the 
initiation of studies M2301 and M2302, a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study [Study A2324] was 
conducted in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque PsO weighing ≥90 kg to evaluate efficacy and 
safety of the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W dose regimen in comparison with the secukinumab 300 mg 
Q4W dose regimen. The study demonstrated clinical benefit of the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W dose 
regimen over the Q4W dose regimen in this PsO patient population without increased safety risks, leading 
to its recent approval in the EU (procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0076), where the authorised posology 
Assessment report

now includes the following provision for dose escalation from the standard Q4W maintenance regimen: 
“Based on clinical response, a maintenance dose of 300 mg every 2 weeks may provide additional benefit 
for patients with a body weight of 90 kg or higher.” 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
CAIN457M2301 (“SUNSHINE”) and CAIN457M2302 (“SUNRISE”) A 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter study assessing short (16 weeks) and 
long-term efficacy (up to 1 year), safety, and tolerability of 2 subcutaneous 
secukinumab dose regimens in adult patients with moderate to severe 
hidradenitis suppurativa 
As part of the initial submission, the MAH submitted Week 16 interim clinical study reports for both 
studies, with Week 52 data being included for some 65% of subjects. Additional data based on the full 52 
week datasets were provided as part of the MAH response to the RSI. 
As the studies were identical in design and the MAH has conducted analyses pooling results from the 
two studies, the Methods and Results sections present the studies together, with differences between the 
studies highlighted as relevant. 
Methods 
Studies M2301 and 2302 were multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
studies with two secukinumab dose regimens in subjects with moderate to severe HS. Each study 
consisted of: Screening (up to 4 weeks), placebo-controlled Treatment Period 1 (16 weeks) and 
Treatment Period 2 (36 weeks, all subjects on secukinumab). Both dose regimens started with an 
induction period (300 mg loading injections at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4), followed by the 
maintenance treatment at the specified dosing frequency (Q2W or Q4W). Subjects who completed 
Treatment Period 1 then entered Treatment Period 2. Subjects who were randomised to either of the two 
secukinumab dose regimens continued on the same dose regimen. Subjects who were randomised to 
either of the two ‘Placebo to secukinumab’ regimens received secukinumab 300 mg at Weeks 16, 17, 18, 
19, and 20 as loading injections, then at the randomised schedule of either Q2W or Q4W thereafter. Both 
studies were conducted in double-blind fashion for their entire duration (52 weeks). Subjects who 
prematurely discontinued the study, or who completed the study and could not or did not wish to 
continue in the optional extension study, were required to complete a post-treatment follow-up period (8 
weeks). Key elements of the studies are outlined in Table 3, and the study design is graphically depicted 
in Figure 14.

The effects of treatment discontinuation are being studied in a currently ongoing HS extension 
study M2301E1. Study M2301E1 is a four-year long-term extension study, and its purpose is to evaluate 
the effect of treatment interruption (randomised withdrawal) and re-treatment with secukinumab on 
efficacy, tolerability and safety in subjects with moderate to severe HS who completed either of the 
two Phase III studies, M2301 or M2302. Analyses will include evaluation of time to loss of response, 
number of flares and the effect of restarting secukinumab therapy on regaining HiSCR. Furthermore, the 
study will address the question of whether an increase in dose following loss of response is effective in 
regaining and sustaining clinical response and a favourable risk-benefit ratio as well as the time required 
to regain HiSCR response after re-treatment following loss of response. The primary endpoint analysis of 
the extension study will be conducted on data collected at Week 104 (currently estimated for H2 2023).

Treatment arms: 
At Baseline/Randomisation visit, all eligible subjects were randomised via Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT) in a 1:1:0.5:0.5 ratio to one of the following 4 treatment groups: 
•  Secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) group: subjects were to receive a loading dose of 
secukinumab 300 mg once weekly for four weeks (at Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), 
followed by secukinumab 300 mg every two weeks, starting at Week 6 and up to Week 50. These 
subjects were to receive two additional placebo injections at Weeks 17 and 19 to maintain the 
treatment blind during the re-induction. 
•  Secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) group: subjects were to receive secukinumab 
300 mg once weekly for four weeks (at Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by 
secukinumab 300 mg every four weeks, starting at Week 8 and up to Week 48. In order to 
maintain the treatment blind, subjects in this group were to also receive a placebo injection every 
4 weeks starting at Week 6, until Week 50. These subjects were to receive three additional 
placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19 to maintain the treatment blind during the re-
induction. 
• 
Placebo group to secukinumab 300 mg Q2W: subjects were to receive placebo once weekly for 
four weeks (at Randomisation, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by placebo every two weeks, 
starting at Week 6 and up to Week 14. At Week 16, subjects were to be switched from Placebo to 
Secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks. The subjects were to receive secukinumab 300 mg once 
weekly for four weeks (Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20), followed by secukinumab 300 mg every 
two weeks, starting at Week 22 and until Week 50. 
• 
Placebo group to secukinumab 300 mg Q4W: subjects were to receive placebo once weekly for 
four weeks (at Randomization, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by placebo every two weeks, 
starting at Week 6 and up to Week 14. At Week 16, subjects were to be switched from Placebo to 
Secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks. The subjects were to receive secukinumab 300 mg once 
weekly for four weeks (Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20), followed by secukinumab 300 mg every 
four weeks, starting at Week 24 and up to Week 48. To maintain the treatment blind, subjects 
were to receive placebo alternating with secukinumab starting at Week 22 and up to Week 50. 
Concomitant treatments: 
Subjects were requested to use daily topical over-the-counter antiseptics or wound care dressings on the 
skin areas affected by HS lesions following local standard practice. 
Systemic antibiotics for the treatment of acute systemic infectious disease both related or unrelated to HS 
(e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis) were allowed as medically warranted during the study. Prior to Week 16, 
systemic antibiotics for the treatment of HS (minocycline or doxycycline up to 100 mg b.i.d.) were only 
allowed as rescue medication. For subjects entering the study in the antibiotic strata, treatment with 
tetracycline up to 500 mg b.i.d., minocycline up to 100 mg b.i.d., and doxycycline up to 100 mg b.i.d. on 
stable dose was allowed. 
At Week 4, 8 and 12, if a subject experienced an increase in their AN count (for example, the total count 
was ≥ 150% of the weighted average of screening and baseline AN count with a minimum increase of 
3 lesions), oral antibiotics could be used as rescue medication. This applied only to Treatment Period 1. 
Subjects were required to wash-out any ongoing opioid analgesics (including tramadol) for 14 days prior 
to Baseline. In case a subject presented with uncontrolled pain related to HS during the study, ibuprofen 
and acetaminophen (paracetamol) was used. If the HS pain was still not controlled with ibuprofen or 
paracetamol at the maximal dose as per local label, tramadol (at a dose of up to 100 mg orally every 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

4 hours) could be prescribed. The use of other opioid analgesics was prohibited during participation in the 
study. 
The study protocols included a table of other prohibited medications, such as immunomodulatory drugs, 
systemic corticosteroids, and live vaccines, outlining required wash-out periods prior to randomisation. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The purpose of the development plan with twin studies M2301 and M2302 was to demonstrate the 
efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of secukinumab at Week 16 based on HiSCR50 rates versus 
placebo, along with the maintenance of efficacy and safety of secukinumab up to Week 52, in subjects 
with moderate to severe HS. The stated objectives of studies along with their associated endpoints are 
listed in Table 4.

The following endpoint definitions were applied: 
Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) 
The HiSCR is defined by the status of three types of lesions: abscesses (fluctuant, with or without 
drainage, tender or painful), inflammatory nodules (tender, erythematous, pyogenic granuloma lesion), 
and draining fistulae (sinus tracts, with communications to skin surface, draining purulent discharge). The 
definition of responders to treatment (HiSCR achievers) was: 
• 
• 
• 
at least a 50% reduction in abscesses and inflammatory nodules (ANs), 
no increase in the number of abscesses, and 
no increase in the number of draining fistulas from baseline. 
HiSCR75, HiSCR90, and HiSCR100 were defined by increasing the threshold on percentage reduction in 
AN count to 75%, 90% and 100%, respectively. 
The HiSCR was derived from the individual lesion counts of abscesses, nodules and fistulae at scheduled 
visits. Individual lesion counts were performed for all lesions, including any existing and newly observed 
lesions. The HS lesions were defined as: 
• 
Inflammatory nodules (N) that are typically raised, deep-seated, three-dimensional, round, 
tender, erythematous, infiltrated and possibly pyogenic granuloma lesions with a diameter of >10 
mm 
•  Abscesses (A) that are often inflammatory, painful, tender but fluctuating mass with a diameter 
of >10 mm, surrounded by an erythematous area; the middle of an abscess contains pus 
•  Draining fistulae (DF); sinus tracts, raised, tender but fluctuating longitudinal mass of variable 
length and depth, with communications to skin surface, draining purulent fluid 
• 
Fistulae (F): total fistulae defined as sinus tracts, raised, tender but fluctuating longitudinal mass 
of variable length and depth, with communications to skin surface, both draining and non-
draining purulent fluid. 
Lesion counts were completed at two Screening visits, Baseline Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16, 18, 20 
and every four weeks until week 60. 
AN count 
AN count is the sum of individual lesions of abscesses and inflammatory nodules in the HS affected areas 
as assessed by the physician. 
Flare 
A flare was defined as at least a 25% increase in AN count with a minimum increase of 2 in absolute 
AN count relative to baseline. 
Skin Pain - NRS 
The Patient's global assessment of skin pain - NRS in the past 24 hours was used to assess pain “at its 
worst” and the average skin pain due to HS in the last 24 hours. The NRS is a segmented numeric version 
of the visual analogue scale in which a respondent selects a whole number (0–10 integers) that best 
reflects the intensity of their pain ranging from 0 (no skin pain) to 10 (skin pain as bad as you can 
imagine). 
NRS30 (skin pain) was defined as at least a 30% reduction and at least 2 units reduction from baseline in 
Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain - at worst. The Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain - NRS

was completed by the subject using an eDiary device. NRS30 response was primarily evaluated in 
subjects with baseline NRS ≥3; in response to a presubmission request, the MAH also provided analyses 
for the FAS without regard to baseline NRS. 
Sample size 
Sample size of the studies was primarily driven by HiSCR at Week 16 endpoint. A total of 471 subjects 
was originally planned to be randomised to study drug in a 1:1:0.5:0.5 ratio.  
Both studies were independently powered to address the primary endpoint (HiSCR) and secondary 
endpoints of AN count and flare. In terms of HiSCR, based on adalimumab phase III placebo-controlled 
studies (PIONEER I and II, respectively, Kimball et al 2016), a placebo response rate of 30% is assumed. 
The total sample size of 471 subjects for this trial was considered sufficient to achieve 93% power for the 
demonstration of 20% difference of secukinumab 300 mg Q2W over placebo when assuming the 
secukinumab response rate to be 50%. In regard to the comparison of secukinumab 300 mg Q4W to 
placebo, the power was to show superiority was expected to be 83%. 
The secondary endpoint of pain was analysed in the combined populations of both trials, provided the 
primary null-hypothesis could be rejected in both studies. 
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the number of randomised subjects was increased to approximately 541 
(15% increase from the original population of 471 subjects) by protocol Amendment 01. 
Randomisation 
Each subject was identified in the study by a subject number that was assigned when the subject was 
enrolled for screening. After confirming the subject inclusion/exclusion criteria, IRT was contacted to 
assign a randomisation number to the subject, which was used to link the subject to a treatment arm. 
The randomisation number was not communicated to the Investigator or his/her delegate. Randomisation 
was stratified by region, concomitant antibiotic use and body weight.  
Blinding (masking) 
This is a double-blind study. Subjects, site staff, persons performing the assessments, and Novartis 
clinical trial team remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until 
database lock with exception of drug supply management, vendors whose roles required unblinding. At 
the time of the interim database lock, the study team members involved in primary endpoint analysis 
separated from the blinded study team had access to the unblinded results as described in the unblinding 
charter. These members were no longer directly involved in the conduct of the trial after primary analysis 
interim database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were used for the data analysis. 
•  Randomised analysis set: consisted of all randomised subjects. Subjects were analysed according 
to the treatment they were assigned to at randomisation. Unless otherwise specified, 
mis-randomised subjects (mis-randomised in IRT) were excluded from the randomised analysis 
set. Mis-randomised subjects are subjects who were screen-failures but had been randomised by 
the Investigator before eligibility was finally assessed, however had not been treated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 37/158 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, all subjects with serious GCP violation at their site were excluded from the 
randomised analysis set. 
• 
Full analysis set: consisted of all subjects to whom study treatment had been assigned. Subjects 
were analysed according to the treatment assigned to at randomisation. Mis-randomised subjects 
(mis-randomised in IRT) and subjects with serious GCP violation at their site were excluded from 
FAS. If the actual stratum was different to the assigned stratum in IRT, the actual stratum was 
used in analyses. 
In practice, in both studies M2301 and M2302, Randomised analysis set, and Full analyses set were the 
same. 
Primary efficacy endpoint HISCR50 response 
The primary clinical question of interest was: what is the effect of secukinumab vs. placebo on HiSCR50 
response at Week 16 in subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa who were on the 
randomized study treatment. 
The primary estimand was described by the following attributes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Population: Subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa who had a total of at least 
5 inflammatory lesions, i.e., abscesses and/or inflammatory nodules, affecting at least 2 distinct 
anatomic areas, and who had HS diagnosed ≥1 years defined through appropriate 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Endpoint: HiSCR50 response at Week 16, which was defined as at least a 50% decrease in 
abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count with no increase in the number of abscesses and/or 
in the number of draining fistulae from baseline to Week 16. 
Treatment of interest: The randomized study treatment (secukinumab 300 mg in two different 
dosing regimens Q2W and Q4W or placebo). 
The summary measure: odds ratio of secukinumab dose regimens vs. placebo. 
The primary endpoint of the study was HiSCR50 response after 16 weeks of treatment. The statistical 
hypothesis for the primary endpoint being tested was that there was no difference in the proportion of 
HiSCR50 (HiSCR) responders at Week 16 in any of the secukinumab regimens versus placebo. 
Let pj denote the proportion of HiSCR50 response at Week 16 for treatment regimens j, j = 0, 1, 2 where 
•  0 corresponds to placebo regimen 
•  1 corresponds to secukinumab 300 mg Q2W s.c. 
•  2 corresponds to secukinumab 300 mg Q4W s.c. 
Hj: pj = p0 for j=1,2, was tested against the alternative HAj : pj ≠ p0 for at least one secukinumab 
regimen, i.e.: 
•  H1: secukinumab 300 mg Q2W s.c. is not different to placebo regimen with respect to HiSCR after 
16 weeks of treatment 
•  H2: secukinumab 300 mg Q4W s.c. is not different to placebo regimen with respect to HiSCR after 
16 weeks of treatment. 
The primary analysis method was logistic regression with treatment group, Hurley stage, and baseline AN 
count as explanatory variables. Geographical region, use of antibiotics and baseline body weight were 
also used as explanatory variables. Odds ratios were computed for comparisons of secukinumab dose 
regimens versus placebo utilizing the logistic regression model fit. Efficacy of two secukinumab regimens 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 38/158 
 
 
 
 
compared to placebo with respect to HiSCR after 16 weeks of treatment was to be demonstrated if H1 
and/or H2 is/are rejected in favour of secukinumab. In protocol amendment 2, the alpha level was 
reallocated as α=0.02 for secukinumab Q2W vs. placebo and α=0.005 for Q4W vs. placebo).  
The pooled analysis of the two studies was similar to the primary analysis of individual studies except that 
study effect was added as an explanatory variable. 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Missing data were multiple imputed based on the estimand strategy related to intercurrent events (ICE) 
or missing at random assumption for all missing values not related to intercurrent events. The following 
intercurrent events were considered: 
1.  Intake of prohibited medication/treatment (medication/treatment with possible confounding effect 
defined as biologics if taken more than once, antibiotics in the nonantibiotic stratum if taken over 
a period of more than 14 days, or any major HS-related surgery for HS other than allowed as 
a rescue therapy). A treatment policy strategy was applied in any case of prohibited medication. 
Such events were ignored, and all observed values were considered. Missing data was multiple 
imputed using a reference-based approach for the secukinumab groups and based on missing at 
random assumption for the placebo arm. 
2.  Intake of rescue medication: a composite strategy was applied. If such an event (intake of rescue 
antibiotics) occurred, the subject was considered as a non-responder. 
3.  Permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to adverse events or lack of efficacy: a 
composite strategy was applied in the same way as described under intercurrent event #2. 
4.  Permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to reasons other than adverse events or lack of 
efficacy: a hypothetical strategy was applied. Any observation after such an event was discarded 
and imputed via multiple imputation under the MAR assumption. 
5.  COVID-19 related intercurrent events: 
•  missed at least one dose prior to Week 16 due to COVID-19; 
• 
discontinued treatment prior to Week 16 due to COVID-19. 
A treatment policy strategy was applied in the same way as described under intercurrent event #1. 
Further justification of the ICE strategy is provided in the SAP (Amendment 4) but included for brevity. 
As the primary endpoint in this study was a binary outcome derived from underlying quantitative 
variables, the imputations were performed on those continuous variables. In this analysis, the number of 
abscesses, inflammatory nodules, and draining fistulae were imputed separately and the response 
variable were derived based on the imputed values. 
Sensitivity and supplementary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
A tipping point analysis in regard to the multiple imputation procedure was implemented. 
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis considering a weighted baseline lesion count (weighted average of the 
screening and the baseline visits) was done. 
Supplementary analysis 
A supplementary estimand was implemented in which all attributes of this estimand remained the same 
as defined for the primary estimand apart from the handing of the intercurrent events: essentially all 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

intercurrent events were handled as per treatment policy strategy. Missing data were multiple imputed 
using a reference-based approach for the secukinumab arms and based on missing at random (MAR) 
assumption for the placebo arm. 
Analysis supporting secondary objectives 
The analysis method for percentage change from baseline in AN count at Week 16 was an ANCOVA model 
with treatment group, Hurley stage, baseline AN counts, geographical region, use of antibiotic, and 
baseline body weight as explanatory variables.  
The analysis method for the other two secondary endpoints will be logistic regression: 
• 
Flare over 16 weeks: with treatment group, Hurley stage, and baseline AN counts as explanatory 
variables; geographical region, use of antibiotic, and baseline body weight (categorized as 
stratified) will be also included as explanatory variables. 
•  Skin Pain/NRS30 at Week 16: with treatment group, Hurley stage, and baseline NRS as 
explanatory variables; geographical region, use of antibiotic, baseline body weight (categorized as 
stratified), and study will be also included as explanatory variables. The data of both studies will 
be pooled for this analysis. 
The MAH had prespecified a testing strategy for efficacy hypothesis across the primary and secondary 
endpoints, dose regimen and the two studies (Figure 15). Once HiSCR, percentage change in AN count 
and flare hypotheses for a secukinumab regimen were rejected, the respective 4α/5 for the Q2W regimen 
and α/5 for the Q4W regimen could be passed on to the other regimen’s hypotheses, if they were not 
already rejected at the initial significance level. If both studies independently rejected the primary 
null-hypothesis on the same secukinumab regimen (H1 and H'1, or H2 and H'2), then the corresponding 
secukinumab regimen’s pain hypothesis (H7 or H8) could be tested. Additionally, the significance level for 
a rejected pain hypothesis could be passed from one dose regimen to the other dose regimen and the 
primary null hypothesis on the two secukinumab regimen were all rejected. The initial significance level 
for pain hypothesis (H7 and/or H8) was set to α-α2. The subtraction of α2 was to account for the 
maximum possible type I error to claim a success for HiSCR, percentage change in AN count and flare in 
both studies. Therefore, the type I error rate was controlled at level α for the submission on all 
hypothesis endpoints. Under the global null hypothesis (i.e., no difference between secukinumab and 
placebo), the testing procedure outlined above controls the type I error rate (one-sided) at the study-
level to <0.025, and at the submission level to <0.000625 (=0.0252). Considering all possible 
configurations of true and false null hypotheses, the type I error control at the level of the submission is 
<0.000625 for the primary objectives, and <0.025 for all hypotheses.

The long-term data, provided in response to the RSI, were mainly summarised in terms of observed case. 
In addition, HiSCR50 response was analysed with a mixed effects logistic regression model (MELRM) with 
treatment group, baseline AN count, visit, and treatment group*visit as fixed effects and with 
unstructured covariance matrix. Cumulative flares was analyses with a similar model but with AR(1) 
covariance matrix. Percentage change in AN count was analyses with a MMRM with the same set of fixed 
effects and applying unstructured covariance matrix. Time to flare distribution was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method; subjects who did not experience a disease flare, were censored at the date of their 
last non-missing visit. 
Interim analysis for futility or early efficacy 
An interim analysis was planned when approximately 40% of the subjects in studies M2301 and M2302 
combined have completed Week 16. The results were to be used to allow stopping the studies for 
demonstrated efficacy, or for futility. 
Efficacy would be demonstrated, and the studies may validly be stopped as a result, if the following are 
satisfied for at least one of the secukinumab regimens: the difference between observed response rates 
for pooled data from both studies versus placebo exceeds 40%; and the difference between observed 
response rates on the corresponding secukinumab regimen vs. placebo exceeds 35% in both studies and 
is significant at a one-sided alpha level of 0.00001 (Haybittle-Peto type boundary). As a result, final 
analysis for each secukinumab regimen would be tested at one-sided adjusted alpha level of 0.01249.

Results 
Participant flow 
Treatment Period 1 
A total of 1084 subjects, 541 subjects in M2301 and 543 subjects in M2302, were randomised to 
secukinumab Q2W, secukinumab Q4W, placebo to secukinumab Q2W or placebo to secukinumab 
Q4W arms. Most subjects (94.1% in M2301 and 93.2% in M2302) completed the first 16 weeks of the 
study treatment (Treatment Period 1) in both studies. The subjects who discontinued the study treatment 
(5.9% in M2301 and 6.8% in M2302) also discontinued the study. Overall, the most frequently reported 
reason for discontinuing study treatment was subject decision in both studies (3.3% in M2301 and 3.7% 
in M2302). Discontinuation of study treatment due to adverse events was 0.9% in M2301 and 1.7% in 
M2302. Two subjects (one each in the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen and placebo) in M2302 
discontinued study treatment due to lack of efficacy; it should however be noted that also for many 
discontinuations formally recorded as being due to subject decision, the reason is further specified as lack 
of efficacy. Subject disposition for Treatment Period 1 is summarised in Table 5.

Table 5 Subject disposition – Treatment Period 1 (M2301, M2302 and pooled data) (Randomised analysis 
set) 
Entire study period 
In studies M2301 and M2302, 76.0% and 77.2% of subjects, respectively, completed 52 weeks of study 
treatment. Among subjects who discontinued study treatment, the most frequently reported primary 
reason for discontinuing study treatment was subject decision in both studies (14.8% in M2301 and 
12.5% in M2302). The proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment due to adverse events 
was 3.5% in M2301 and 3.9% in M2302; for lack of efficacy, the proportions were 1.1% in M2301 and 
2.0% in M2302. However, as already noted above, the predominant reason for the subject decision was 
unsatisfactory treatment effect in both studies (7.0% in M2301 and 4.1% in M2302). 
Approximately 85% of subjects who completed the studies M2301 (340 out of 399) and M2302 (358 out 
of 418) entered the extension study. Subject disposition for the entire study period as of the data cut-off

Recruitment 
Study M2301 was conducted across 111 Investigator sites in 29 countries: Argentina (n=9), 
Australia (n=18), Austria (n=8), Belgium (n=10), Bulgaria (n=8), Canada (n=16), Czech Republic 
(n=18), France (n=56), Germany (n=64), Greece (n=19), Hungary (n=8), India (n=11), Israel (n=6),

South Africa (n=21), Spain (n=27), Switzerland (n=7), Turkey (n=14), United Kingdom (n=20), United 
States (n=81) and Vietnam (n=5). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocols for both studies had an effective date of 07 August 2018. First subject first visits 
took place on 31 January 2019 for M2301, and on 25 February 2019 for M2302. Data cut-offs for the 
Week 16 analyses took place on 01 October 2021 for M2301, and on 23 September 2021 for M2302. 
The protocols were simultaneously amended on two occasions: 
• 
• 
In Amendment 01, dated 17 June 2020, corrective measures to address the emerging COVID-19 
pandemic were implemented, including the potential for shipping study drug for home 
administration, remote visits and up to 3 unscheduled visits, and permitting the enrolment of up 
to 15% additional subjects if missing data due to COVID-19 jeopardises the pre-planned 
statistical power. 
In Amendment 02, dated 08 January 2021, the statistical testing strategy was amended to 
address emerging external data from a psoriasis study, which showed that a Q2W regimen could 
be preferable to Q4W in patients with a body weight of 90 kg or above. The split of the overall 
alpha level was thereby adjusted, allocating 80% to testing the Q2W regimen versus placebo. A 
secondary endpoint evaluating only the abscesses and inflammatory nodules (AN) count (AN 
count) was added. Furthermore, evaluation of inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) and of the 
achievement of HiSCR in bio-naïve patients, and in patients with body weight lower and higher 
than 90 kg (<90 kg and ≥90 kg) were added as exploratory subgroup analyses. To address the 
ongoing pandemic, the respective sample sizes were also formally increased as already 
envisioned in Amendment 01.

In study M2301, 173 (32%) subjects had at least one protocol deviation during Treatment Period 1 
(Table 8). The most common categories of protocol deviations were “treatment deviation” (18.1%), 
mainly related to home vs. site drug administration, “other” (10.5%), and “prohibited concomitant 
medication” (7.0%). Table 9 shows protocol deviations in M2301 over the entire study period.

In study M2302, 158 (29.1%) subjects had at least one protocol deviation during Treatment Period 1 
(Table 10). The most common categories of protocol deviations were “treatment deviation”, mainly 
related to home vs. site drug administration (15.3%) and similar across groups, “other” (7.9%), and 
“prohibited concomitant medication” (7.6%). Table 11 shows protocol deviations in M2302 over the

Baseline data 
Overall, the mean age of subjects was 36.1 years in M2301 and 36.3 years in M2302 with the majority of 
the subjects aged between 30 and <65 years in both studies. In M2301, the proportion of 
subjects <30 years was slightly higher in the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen compared to the other 
treatment groups (32.0% in Q2W, 38.3% in Q4W, 28.3% in placebo) while in M2302, the proportion of 
subjects aged 40 to <65 was higher in the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen compared to the other 
treatment groups (42.8% in Q2W, 31.7% in Q4W, 32.2% in placebo). The proportion of female subjects 
was 56.2% in M2301 and 56.4% in M2302 and the proportion of White subjects was 79.5% in M2301 and 
76.4% in M2302. The mean BMI was 32.46 kg/m2 in M2301 and 31.76 kg/m2 in M2302. The proportion of 
subjects weighing ≥ 90 kg was 54.7% in M2301 and 50.8% in M2302. More than half of the subjects were 
current smokers in both studies (54.0% each). The proportion of never smokers in M2301 was slightly 
higher in the secukinumab Q2W (33.1%) and Q4W (31.1%) dose regimens compared to placebo (27.2%) 
and that proportion in M2302 was higher in secukinumab Q4W dose regimen (36.1%) compared to 
secukinumab Q2W dose regimen (28.3%) and placebo (29.0%). A summary of demographic 
characteristics is displayed in Table 12.

Table 12 Demographic characteristics (M2301, M2302 and pooled data) (Randomized analysis set) 
Mean time since HS diagnosis was 7.1 years in M2301 and 7.4 years in M2302, while the mean time since 
symptom-onset was 13.0 years in M2301 and 13.3 years in M2302. Most subjects presented with Hurley 
stage II or III at baseline (61.4% and 34.0% in M2301 and 56.7% and 40.5% in M2302, respectively). 
When the treatment groups were compared in each study, the proportion of subjects with Hurley stage 
III, which describes a more severe population with a greater component of scarring, fibrosis and tunnels, 
was higher in the secukinumab Q2W (38.7%) and Q4W (35.0%) dose regimens than in placebo (28.3%) 
in M2301, and was higher in the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen (45.6%) than in the secukinumab 
Q4W dose regimen (37.8%) and placebo (38.3%) in M2302.

Overall, the proportion of subjects with previous exposure to systemic biologic therapy was 23.8% in 
M2301 and 23.2% in M2302, and most of these subjects received adalimumab (22.6% in M2301, 21.4% 
in M2302). Most subjects received previous systemic antibiotics (82.3% in M2301, 83.6% in M2302), 
which had been mostly discontinued by the time of study entry for the predominant reason of lack of 
efficacy (approximately 60%). The proportion of subjects who had undergone surgical intervention for HS 
was 39.9% in M2301 and 41.6% in M2302. The proportion of subjects who entered the studies on a 
stable dose of systemic antibiotics was similar between the treatment groups in the individual studies: 
14.4% in the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen, 13.9% in the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen, 10.0% in 
placebo in M2301; 10.0% in the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen, 11.7% in the secukinumab Q4W dose 
regimen, 10.4% in placebo in M2302. 
Disease history and baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 13. According to the MAH, 
the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen in both studies comprised a more severe population (i.e., more 
subjects with Hurley stage III, having higher abscess and fistulae count) compared to the other treatment 
groups. This imbalance was prominent in M2302, and the overall population was more severe in M2302 
than in M2301. Similar to the trends observed in the individual studies, the pooled secukinumab Q2W 
dose regimen also comprised a more severe population than the other pooled groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Within the MAH’s testing strategy, M2301 met the primary and all secondary objectives and M2302 met 
the primary and all but one secondary objectives for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen. The primary 
and all but one secondary objectives were met for the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen in M2302, 
whereas in M2301, hypothesis testing stopped at the primary endpoint with a nominal p-value of 0.0418.

In both studies, both secukinumab dose regimens showed higher HiSCR50 response rates than placebo at 
Week 16 (45.0% in secukinumab Q2W, 41.8% in secukinumab Q4W, 33.7% in placebo in M2301; 42.3% 
in secukinumab Q2W, 46.1% in secukinumab Q4W, 31.2% in placebo in M2302). The estimated odds 
ratio of secukinumab to placebo for HiSCR50 response rate at Week 16 was statistically significant for the 
secukinumab Q2W dose regimen in both studies. For the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen, statistical 
significance was shown only in study M2302, in which the treatment difference to placebo was even larger 
for the Q4W regimen than for the Q2W regimen (14.9 and 11.1 percentage points, respectively). Pooled 
data supported the treatment effect of both secukinumab doses. Table 17 displays the results of the 
logistic regression analysis, and Figure 16 displays the corresponding forest plot.

The results of the pre-defined sensitivity analyses (using the weighted average across screening and 
baseline visit assessments as baseline value) and a supplementary analysis (using a treatment policy 
strategy on all intercurrent events) on HiSCR50 response rate at Week 16 in each study are shown in 
Table 18 Summary of HiSCR50 response analyses at Week 16 for study M2301- Full analysis set and 
Table 19. As a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis on HiSCR50 response rate at Week 16 
was also repeated to include age, hsCRP and smoking status as additional covariates in the model, as the 
MAH considered these baseline factors associated with disease severity to be disproportionately 
distributed across the treatment groups. The results were consistent with the primary analysis results in 
both studies and in pooled data; notably, for study M2302, the odds ratio vs. placebo remained larger for 
the Q4W group compared to the Q2W group.

In both studies, a HiSCR50 response was observed as early as Week 2 for both secukinumab dose 
regimens, and the HiSCR50 response rate was higher in both secukinumab dose regimens than in placebo 
at all time points from Week 2 up to Week 16. The evolution of HiSCR50 response over time is displayed 
in Figure 17.

Given the identical initial loading up to Week 4 in both secukinumab dose regimens, any differences 
observed up to Week 4 are likely due to chance or random imbalances as opposed to differences between 
the regimens. Thus, to better understand the effect of the maintenance regimens on response, the 
difference between Week 4 and Week 16 in the HiSCR50 response rates was calculated for each of the 
secukinumab dose regimens. The increase from Week 4 to Week 16 was greater for the secukinumab 
Q2W dose regimen compared to the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen in both studies and in pooled data 
(Figure 18). Odds ratios for Q2W vs. Q4W were also calculated using Week 4 HiSCR response status as a 
covariate; these are shown in Table 20.

Secondary endpoints – placebo-controlled period 
AN count 
In both studies, the mean percentage change from baseline in AN count at Week 16 was larger (greater 
decrease in AN count) in both secukinumab dose regimens than in placebo (−46.8% in secukinumab 
Q2W, −42.4% in secukinumab Q4W, −24.3% in placebo in M2301; −39.3% in secukinumab Q2W, 
−45.5% in secukinumab Q4W, −22.4% in placebo in M2302). The estimated LS mean difference between 
treatment groups (secukinumab vs. placebo) for percentage change from baseline in AN count at Week 
16 was statistically significant for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen in both studies and for the 
secukinumab Q4W dose regimen in M2302. The secukinumab Q4W dose regimen in M2301 did not 
achieve statistical significance based on the testing hierarchy. The results are summarised in Table 22.

Flares 
In both studies, the proportion of subjects experiencing flares over the 16 weeks of the placebo-
controlled period was lower in both secukinumab dose regimens compared to placebo (15.4% in 
secukinumab Q2W, 23.2% in secukinumab Q4W, 29.0% in placebo in M2301; 20.1% in secukinumab 
Q2W, 15.6% in secukinumab Q4W, 27.0% in placebo in M2302). As seen in Table 23, the estimated 
odds ratio of secukinumab to placebo for the proportion of subjects experiencing flares over 16 weeks 
was statistically significant for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen in M2301 and for the secukinumab 
Q4W dose regimen in M2302. Flare rate by visit is shown in Figure 21 and change in flare rate from 
Week 4 to Week 16 is shown in Figure 22.

Pain – NRS30 
As indicated above, pain response was primarily analysed among subjects with baseline NRS ≥3 (N=769, 
i.e., about 71% of the total number of subjects) and was only pre-planned to be analysed with pooled 
data. In the pooled analysis for skin pain, the NRS30 response rate at Week 16 was higher in both 
secukinumab dose regimens than in placebo (36.6% in secukinumab Q2W, 33.5% in secukinumab Q4W, 
23.0% in placebo). The estimated odds ratio of secukinumab to placebo for NRS30 response rate at Week 
16 was statistically significant for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen; the odds ratio of the Q4W dose 
regimen to placebo was not statistically significant despite a numerically quite similar treatment 
difference. The results for the pooled data are summarised in Table 24, and the forest plot in Figure 23 
also displays NRS30 results from both individual studies.

MMRM model and pooled as-observed data (Table 25). The adjusted mean change from baseline in NRS 
score was larger in both secukinumab dose regimens than in placebo across all time points, with Week 16 
values of −1.27 in the secukinumab Q2W, −1.10 in the secukinumab Q4W, and −0.54 in placebo. The 
estimated treatment difference (secukinumab – placebo) in change from baseline in NRS score at 
Week 16 (95% CI) was −0.74 (−1.06, −0.42) for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen and −0.56 
(−0.88, −0.23) for the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen.

Patient-reported outcomes – DLQI 
In both studies, the mean DLQI total score decreased at Weeks 2 and 4 and then remained relatively 
stable up to Week 16 in both secukinumab dose regimens (Figure 25). The mean absolute change from 
baseline to Week 16 in the DLQI total score was −4.3 for Q2W, −3.5 for Q4W, and −1.2 for placebo in 
M2301; −4.3 for Q2W, −3.7 for Q4W, and −1.5 for placebo in M2302. DLQI response rates (defined as 
a decrease of ≥5.0 points from baseline and analysed among the subgroup with a baseline DLQI of ≥5.0) 
at Week 16 in the Q2W, Q4W and placebo groups, respectively, were 47.8%, 48.4% and 28.9% in

HiSCR response 
Based on observed data, HiSCR50 response rate at Week 52 for the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W dose 
regimens was 56.4% and 56.3% in M2301, and 65.0% and 62.2% in M2302, respectively. Results based 
on a mixed effects logistic regression model (MELRM) for HiSCR50 up to Week 52 were in line with the 
results using observed data (M2301: 54.8% with Q2W and 55.3% with Q4W at Week 52; M2302: 63.4% 
with Q2W and 58.6% with Q4W at Week 52). In the groups switching from placebo to secukinumab at 
Week 16, HiSCR50 response rates increased from 30 – 37% at Week 16 to 48 – 55% at Week 52.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The variation application is supported by two identical Phase 3 studies, M2301 and M2302. 
As part of the initial submission, the MAH submitted Week 16 interim clinical study reports for both 
studies, with Week 52 data being included for some 65% of subjects. Additional data based on the full 
52-week datasets were provided at the CHMP request.  
No separate dose response or PK studies were conducted in HS patients to confirm the assumptions made 
in dose selection for the main studies, although this was recommended in SA by the CHMP. The 
assumptions concerning a higher mean exposure being achieved with the Q2W regimen have however 
been confirmed through PK assessments within the main studies.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design 
The design of the studies is quite straightforward and is considered adequate to meet the primary aims of 
the development programme. In light of the expected substantial placebo response rate, the use of a 
placebo control arm is considered essential. Furthermore, the lack of an active control arm was 
considered acceptable in the SA procedure. A total treatment period of 52 weeks is considered sufficient 
for safety assessment purposes and also enables assessment of maintenance of effect. 
According to the MAH, the use of placebo as a comparative agent was limited to 16 weeks due to the 
severity of the disease requiring medical therapy and, hence, ethical concerns of keeping subjects with 
HS on placebo. On the other hand, the CHMP in the SA procedure highlighted the considerable placebo 
response rate observed in previous adalimumab studies in HS. The CHMP therefore considered that a 
placebo control beyond 16 weeks could be feasible with appropriate escape/rescue criteria and also 
recommended incorporating a randomised withdrawal design since the question on cessation and/or dose 
reduction would be an issue of interest. The MAH was requested to further justify its choice of study 
design beyond Week 16 and discuss how the open questions regarding most appropriate long-term 
treatment strategies will be addressed. In the response, the MAH indicated that these issues are being 
addressed in the currently ongoing extension study M2301E1, evaluating the effect of treatment 
interruption (randomised withdrawal) and re-treatment with secukinumab on efficacy, tolerability and 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 96/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety in subjects with moderate to severe HS who completed either of the two Phase 3 studies, M2301 or 
M2302. The CHMP recommends the MAH to submit these results for assessment once they become 
available. According to the MAH, primary endpoint analysis of the extension study will be conducted on 
data collected at Week 104 and is currently estimated for H2 2023. 
In principle, the eligibility criteria were consistent with the proposed indication. Hurley staging was not 
directly used in subject selection; the disease severity of moderate to severe was defined as having a 
total of at least 5 inflammatory lesions, i.e., abscesses and/or inflammatory nodules, affecting at least 2 
distinct anatomic areas. This definition focuses on the degree and extent of inflammatory activity at 
baseline instead of using the level of scarring in the worst affected area (as in the previously used Hurley 
stages). Consistent with this definition, the majority of the study population was still expected to be in 
Hurley stages II and III, with only a small proportion of subjects in Hurley stage I. The justification is 
acknowledged, and the statement “moderate to severe” in the proposed indication wording is considered 
appropriately covered by the CHMP. 
Contrary to the CHMP SA recommendation, previous treatment failure to antibiotics was not a 
requirement to enter the study. The MAH justified the deviation on the assumption that the majority of 
patients entering the study would be expected to have previously received systemic antibiotics at least 
during the period since diagnosis (≥ 1 year). Reflecting the clinical practice in many countries and the 
concern of exposing some patients to placebo for up to 16 weeks without anti-inflammatory therapy, the 
MAH also decided to allow a proportion of the patients to remain on a stable dose of systemic antibiotics 
during Treatment Period 1. Information on the previous use of systemic therapies at baseline was 
collected, confirming that over 80% of subjects had previously received systemic antibiotics for HS, with 
lack of efficacy reported as the most frequent reason for discontinuation. Subgroup analyses based on 
previous antibiotic use were also provided as part of the documentation. It is furthermore noted that the 
proposed indication foresees use in patients who have not responded adequately to conventional systemic 
HS therapy, thereby placing secukinumab into second-line use. The proposed positioning is considered 
appropriate in light of the population enrolled into the studies, and the deviation from SA is considered 
sufficiently addressed by the MAH. 
All subjects are dosed with PFS every other week. From the perspective of experimental setting, the 
placebo group does not represent a realistic real-life treatment strategy but, instead, it reflects the 
outcomes of a secukinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment in the hypothetical scenario where secukinumab 300 
mg has no pharmacological effect on HS outcomes. The injection schedule of secukinumab 300 mg Q4W 
arm was matched with that of secukinumab 300 mg Q2W and the former represents hypothetical 
outcomes of secukinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment where the pharmacological activity of every other dose 
(following loading doses) is eliminated. The setting is ideal for evaluating whether outcomes are improved 
by biweekly dosing of secukinumab as compared with dosing every 4 weeks although comparison of Q2W 
and Q4W regimens is not among pre-planned study objectives. The re-randomisation, at Week 16, of 
subjects that initially received placebo only is considered to provide additional data to allow comparison of 
the Q2W and Q4W dose regimens to induce and maintain improvements in HS outcomes.

b.i.d., and doxycycline up to 100 mg b.i.d.) was allowed for the subjects entered in the antibiotics strata 
provided that the dose was kept stable until Week 16. Topical antibiotics were prohibited from all subjects 
through to Week 16. This is considered appropriate to ensure comparability of the randomised 
treatments.  
The primary signs and symptoms of HS are abscesses, inflammatory nodules or draining fistulas and 
these are assessed by the HiSCR. HiSCR has been used as the primary endpoint for demonstrating clinical 
efficacy of adalimumab and was also endorsed (in fact recommended in favour of a modified definition 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 97/158 
 
 
 
 
proposed by MAH) by the CHMP in the SA. As such, the HiSCR is considered an acceptable primary 
endpoint. 
As evidenced by sometimes large variability in the number and types of HS lesions reported between 
screening and baseline visits, and variability during the placebo treatment, disease activity may fluctuate 
rapidly. Also, the assessment (counting) of each type of manifestation can be assumed to be a source of 
variability. For these reasons, achievement of HiSCR at any point in time cannot be interpreted as 
individual patients having benefited from the treatment. Instead, HiSCR response should be considered as 
one of many potential ways of way of summarising data concerning the time course of joint distribution of 
various lesion types into a comprehensible measure. 
The MAH justified the selection of other endpoints as reflecting the most important domains of HS and 
providing complementary clinically relevant information not fully evaluated in the primary endpoint. While 
the AN count is in fact a part of the HiSCR score, treating the count as a quantitative variable can be 
agreed to provide additional insight. It is also agreed that flares and pain are clinically relevant aspects of 
HS that are not captured with the primary endpoint. As such, and in the absence of any disease-specific 
regulatory guidance, the MAH’s selection of endpoints is overall endorsed. 
Methodological aspects 
Patients that discontinued treatment due to LoE or AE (as based on the treatment withdrawal CRF) were 
considered as non-responders, while other treatment discontinuations led to censoring of affected data 
and were multiple imputed following a hypothetical scenario where treatment was not discontinued. The 
handling of intercurrent events suggests a somewhat hypothetical interpretation to the primary 
analysis: outcome if randomised treatment is continued up to week 16 and no rescue medication were 
used (assuming that those requiring rescue medication would have failed HiSCR50 at Week 16) allowing 
the use of non-rescue medications. A supplementary estimand focuses on Week 16 outcomes regardless 
of whether randomised treatment was discontinued and, as such, corresponds to an ITT analysis. 
However, all subjects who discontinued the study treatment also discontinued the study implying that no 
substantial difference could exist in the results and their interpretation of the primary and supplementary 
estimand and, therefore, no statements should be made about result robustness based on the similarity 
of the two analyses. 
For the primary estimand, the majority of missing data were imputed under MAR, i.e., according to the 
scenario that the subject remained on the randomized treatment. The principle of reference-based 
imputation, adopted for certain intercurrent events, where missing data related to the ICEs were modeled 
as adopting a trajectory of the placebo arm following ICE, is appropriate especially for handling treatment 
discontinuations for the supplementary estimand. Reference-based imputation can be considered 
somewhat conservative for the primary estimand and, as such, acceptable. 
Multiple imputation of HiSCR response and AN count were implemented at the level of the underlying 
quantitative components, for each component separately. The technique used appears to presume that 
the components of HiSCR are inter-independent, e.g., that reduction in inflammatory nodules is not 
informative about concurrent or future reduction of abscesses. The MAH was therefore requested to 
comment on the assumptions and evaluate its appropriateness among the observed data. In response to 
the RSI, the MAH clarified that the manifestations are ‘not necessarily correlated’ and provided some data 
to support this assumption. The principled concerns about the multiple imputation procedure were not 
fully resolved by the MAH’s response. However, considering the relatively small proportion of imputed 
data (especially those with multiple visits missed prior to Week 16) and the stated level of correlation 
between the components, the potential bias to the overall result from this methodological detail alone is 
likely to be small.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 98/158 
 
 
 
 
A tipping analysis was included that explored how many subjects with missing HiSCR evaluation but who 
were multiple imputed as responders need to be switched to non-responders to lose statistical 
significance in the comparison with placebo arm. The p-values appear very insensitive to the number of 
switches. This is probably so because what is shown as the number of switchers appears to indicate the 
maximum number of switches across the 100 multiple imputed datasets rather than actual difference in 
the number of imputed responders. In this respect, the available tipping point analysis is considered 
uninformative and even misleading. 
Randomisation was stratified by geographic region, concomitant antibiotic use and body weight. Each of 
these stratification factors are considered to have their own independent rationale, and it is considered 
reasonable to use statistical models that address the stratification factor’s effects by inclusion of 
a regression parameter corresponding to the level of each stratification factor. Indeed, the MAH used 
logistic regression with the stratification effects as explanatory variables.  
An elegant, graphically illustrated algorithm was prespecified to ensure that familywise type-I-error rate 
does not exceed 2.5%. The hypothesis testing strategy is considered to be clinically meaningful and 
statistically adequate to control the rate of false positive findings. However, an unequal initial allocation of 
alpha was specified as part of protocol amendment 2: 0.02 for the Q2W regimen and 0.005 for the 
Q4W regimen, reflecting MAH’s expectation of better efficacy of Q2W. Unequal allocation of alpha is 
considered acceptable if the decision to do so was not affected by the results. However, an interim 
analysis for futility and efficacy was planned when approximately 40% of the subjects in M2301 and 
M2302 had completed Week 16. In response to the RSI, the MAH explained that neither the futility 
criterion nor the iDMC conveyed any information regarding relative benefit of the different treatment 
arms and detailed “emerging external data” that increased the expectation for the Q2W dosing relative to 
Q4W.  
The appropriateness of the statistical methods for the long-term data appears questionable and partly 
unclear. In particular, the difficulty in interpreting observed case analyses of long-term follow-up studies 
are well recognized. Although the methodological details of the longitudinal logistic regression model are 
partly unclear it is agreed that such a method is helpful in assessing maintenance of effect in terms of 
HiSCR50 response (but not so for cumulative flare rate) especially when evaluated together with the 
MMRM for the more quantitative AN count. 
Study conduct 
The original protocols for both studies had an effective date of 07 August 2018. First subject first visits 
took place on 31 January 2019 for M2301, and on 25 February 2019 for M2302. Data cut-offs for the 
Week 16 analyses took place on 01 October 2021 for M2301, and on 23 September 2021 for M2302. The 
studies were conducted across a geographically diverse selection of countries. EU Member States were 
well represented, with substantial numbers of subjects enrolled e.g. in France and Germany. 
The study protocol was amended on two occasions. The first amendment was implemented primarily to 
address emerging COVID 19 -related challenges in study conduct. Amendment 2 adjusted the statistical 
testing strategy due to emerging external data. Overall, the amendments can be considered adequately 
justified and do not jeopardise the reliability or integrity of the study. A serious GCP violation was 
reported for 2 subjects in study M2301, but these have been adequately described and managed and do 
not raise further concern. 
Disposition and baseline characteristics 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 99/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A high proportion of subjects completed Treatment Period 1 in both studies, and there was no particular 
clustering with respect to reasons for discontinuation. Over the entire study period, attrition remained 
moderate, with most of the discontinuations being attributed to an unsatisfactory treatment effect. Across 
both studies, the number of subjects discontinuing due to an adverse event was quite low, which is 
consistent with experience from secukinumab studies in other indications. Overall, no relevant differences 
are noted between the studies as regards subject disposition. 
As acknowledged by the MAH, many of the study and treatment discontinuations whose primary reason 
was reported as being subject decision were further specified as being related to lack of satisfactory 
treatment response. The MAH was therefore requested to provide a summary of discontinuation reasons 
that more realistically reflects the proportion of patients that discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 
recategorizes other cases, as appropriate, to meaningful groups based on further specification of 
discontinuation reason. In its response, the MAH provided further clarification regarding the 
categorisation, and while the categorisation principles cannot be completely agreed, the limited number 
of subjects discontinuing due to an unsatisfactory treatment response does not warrant further concerns 
about the robustness of the overall conclusions in the current studies, particularly as they relate to the 
primary efficacy analyses at Week 16. As such, the issue is not pursued further. 
Mean age at baseline was about 36 years, and very few subjects aged 65 years or above were enrolled. 
About 56% of subjects were female, and almost 80% were White. Almost 70% were either current or 
former smokers. Mean BMI was about 32 kg/m2. 
Consistent with the MAH’s expectations, the vast majority of subjects were Hurley stage II or III, and the 
sample sizes for both are sufficient to justify the statement “moderate to severe HS” in the proposed 
indication. Previous exposure to adalimumab was reported for 22% of subjects (total N=238), permitting 
a reasonable assessment of efficacy in this subpopulation. Furthermore, previous exposure to systemic 
antibiotics was reported for over 80% of subjects; as such, the enrolled population can in practice be 
considered similar to that targeted by the CHMP’s recommendation of only including subjects with a 
history of failure to antibiotic therapy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At Week 16, both secukinumab dosing regimens showed numerically greater HiSCR50 response rates 
compared to placebo; in study M2302, the result was statistically significant for both regimens (Q2W vs 
placebo: 42.3% vs. 31.2%, p=.0149; Q4W vs placebo: 46.1% vs. 31.2%, p=.0022), whereas in M2301, 
the result for Q4W vs. placebo was not statistically significant (Q2W vs placebo: 45.0% vs. 33.7%, 
p=.0070; Q4W vs placebo: 41.8% vs. 33.7%, p=.0418). It should however be noted that in M2301, the 
difference in response rates between the Q2W and Q4W regimens was only 3 percentage points, and in 
M2302, the treatment difference vs. placebo was numerically larger for the Q4W regimen than the Q2W 
regimen. Results on sensitivity analyses and supplementary analyses, as presented, are consistent with 
the primary analysis. As such, the short-term efficacy has in principle been adequately demonstrated. 
The magnitude of the treatment effect (about 11 percentage points for both regimens vs. placebo in the 
pooled data) can be considered quite modest. Recognising the inherent difficulties in indirect comparison 
of studies, the treatment effect of secukinumab may be somewhat smaller than observed in the 
previously conducted adalimumab studies. However, when contextualised with the dearth of currently 
available therapies, the observed effect is still considered clinically meaningful by the CHMP. 
This notwithstanding, it is not clear that the Q2W can be considered to unequivocally outperform the 
Q4W regimen. As noted above, the supposedly identical trials provide conflicting results for the two 
regimens as regards the treatment difference vs. placebo. The MAH has argued that a more severe 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 100/158 
 
 
 
 
population was enrolled by chance into the Q2W group, but the post-hoc analysis, in which additional 
covariates reflecting disease severity were included, remains largely consistent with the primary analysis. 
Given the identical loading scheme from Week 0 to Week 4 in the Q2W and Q4W regimens and in light of 
differences in observed treatment response at Week 4, additional analyses were also provided to 
elucidate the development of treatment response from Week 4 until Week 16. While the additional 
analyses show some support for a greater increase in response in the Q2W regimen compared to the 
Q4W regimen, it is still noted that in M2302, the calculated OR remains close to 1 and an added benefit 
can therefore not be concluded. 
In light of the small and inconclusively demonstrated incremental gain in average response, the CHMP did 
not agree to the MAH’s initial proposal of recommending the higher Q2W maintenance dose for every 
patient. Instead, an escalation strategy in patients with an insufficient response, similar to that already 
authorised for several other indications, was recommended, even when recognising that it had not been 
directly studied in HS patients. The MAH agreed to amend the posology accordingly (see section 2.3.4 
Discussions on clinical pharmacology). 
Results on AN count were consistent with HiSCR data, with a larger decrease from baseline observed with 
both secukinumab regimens compared to placebo. In M2301, the decrease was larger with Q2W 
compared to Q4W (Q2W vs placebo: -46.8 vs. -24.3, p <.0001; Q4W vs placebo: -42.4 vs. -24.3, 
p=.0004), whereas the opposite was true in M2302 (Q2W vs placebo: -39.3 vs. -22.4, p=.0051; Q4W vs 
placebo: -45.5 vs. -22.4, p=.0001). With respect to flare rate, the increase from Week 4 to Week 16 was 
smaller for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen compared to the secukinumab Q4W dose regimen in both 
studies (M2301: 5.9% for Q2W vs 11.7% for Q4W; M2302: 8.7% for Q2W vs 9.2 for Q4W). 
Pre-planned statistical analyses for NRS30 response were limited to subjects with a baseline NRS ≥3 and 
using pooled data only (Q2W vs placebo: 36.6% vs. 23.0%, p=.0003; Q4W vs placebo: 33.5% vs. 
23.0%, p=.0044). Although the difference to placebo was statistically significant only for the 
Q2W regimen, the numerical differences to placebo were quite similar for both secukinumab regimens, 
with a difference of 3 percentage points in favour of the Q2W regimen. However, within the study-level 
data, it is interesting to note that for M2031, in which e.g., HiSCR50 response rates were quite similar 
between the secukinumab groups, the Q2W regimen performed unexpectedly poorly, whereas in M2302, 
in which the Q4W clearly outperformed Q2W e.g., on HiSCR50 response, the Q2W regimen was 
numerically slightly better than the Q4W regimen. This does not seem consistent with the MAH’s claim 
that the estimate of treatment effect for the Q2W regimen is reduced by a more severe population having 
been enrolled into that treatment group particularly in study M2302. 
A requested post-hoc analysis of NRS data in the FAS showed larger decreases in mean NRS for both 
secukinumab regimens compared to placebo. 
Both secukinumab regimens decreased inflammatory markers (hsCRP and ESR) compared to placebo, 
with slightly greater effect with Q2W. Decreases on DLQI total score were also larger with both 
secukinumab regimens compared to placebo; in M2302, the DLQI response rate seen with Q4W was 
greater than with Q2W. Presentation of results for exploratory endpoints that are analysed outside of the 
multiplicity-controlled testing framework is generally not acceptable in the SmPC, and the MAH was 
initially requested to delete all data related to exploratory endpoints from section 5.1 of the SmPC unless 
a particular justification can be provided. In its response, the MAH further argued that data on health-
related quality of life outcomes would be of high relevance to prescribers and requested retention of the 
data in the SmPC. A very limited presentation was finally agreed by the CHMP. 
Based on analyses of observed data, HiSCR50 response rates achieved by week 16 were maintained and 
even improved further until Week 52, although potential biases related to analyses based on observed 
data should be recognised. Consistent with the interim results, there was overall very little difference in 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 101/158 
 
 
 
 
long-term response rates between the two secukinumab regimens; thus, the long-term results are also 
supportive of a posology that starts with a Q4W maintenance regimen. 
The HiSCR shift table provided by the MAH, based on the subpopulation of subjects for whom both 
Week 16 and Week 52 values were available, also indicates that the majority of subjects in either group 
receiving secukinumab from Week 0 and developing a HiSCR50 response by Week 16 maintained their 
response until Week 52; furthermore, a large proportion of Week 16 non-responders became responders 
by Week 52. Among the subjects switching from placebo to secukinumab at Week 16, some 45% of 
placebo non-responders developed a response by Week 52; this response rate is in fact well aligned with 
the 44% response rate observed with secukinumab from Week 0 to Week 16. Interestingly, among the 
Week 16 placebo responders, the majority maintained their response until Week 52. Nevertheless, the 
inherent biases in the subpopulation available for this analysis have to be recognised. 
At the CHMP request, results based on the full 52-week dataset were provided. Overall, the newly 
provided results do not raise further concern related to maintenance of effect until Week 52.  
Subgroup analyses based on a number of demographic and baseline characteristics quite consistently 
demonstrated effects favouring secukinumab over placebo. However, none of the subgroup analyses 
demonstrate convincing effects favouring Q2W over Q4W. 
With respect to the proposed indication, it is noted that consistent effects were seen between Hurley 
stages II and III; it is thereby agreed that the indication can cover patients with moderate to severe HS. 
It is understood that the proposed indication “moderate to severe” is likely to be interpreted as referring 
to Hurley stages II and III and can thereby be justified. While neither of the secukinumab regimens 
showed efficacy vs placebo among subjects with Hurley stage I, the very small sample size is recognised; 
in any case, Hurley stage I would in clinical practice likely be considered as mild disease and thereby not 
be covered by the proposed indication. Even though the sample size for subjects with previous exposure 
to biologics is somewhat limited, no concerning trend that should limit use among biologic-experienced 
patients can be seen. Additionally, the MAH was requested to include the world “active” in the indication 
as a qualifier for disease state. The MAH agreed and updated the indication wording to include the word 
“active” in it. 
Following an FDA inspection, the MAH identified data discrepancies for the NRS30 / Skin pain endpoint 
(secondary endpoint), impacting both studies CAIN457M2301 and CAIN457M2302; specifically, due to a 
human error, the variables “average pain” and “worst pain” were inadvertently transposed at the time of 
the creation of the Study Data Model Tabulation (SDTM) datasets, resulting in the incorrect NRS pain 
variable used for the analysis of the NRS30 / Skin pain endpoint. The MAH was requested to fully 
complete all of the planned data quality checks for the dossier supporting the registration of the HS 
indication and provide adequate confirmation that all data are correct and that no further updates are 
required, before a final opinion could be adopted. The MAH provided the requested confirmation and 
updated documentation. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In two studies conducted in subjects with moderate to severe HS, secukinumab demonstrated efficacy vs. 
placebo on the primary endpoint of HiSCR50 response rate at Week 16; consistently greater effects vs. 
placebo were also seen on secondary endpoints. Descriptive Week 52 data are supportive of adequate 
maintenance of effect. The long term effect will be further studied in the ongoing extension study 
M2301E1. The CHMP recommends the MAH to submit these results for assessment once they become 
available 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

The size of the treatment effect, while quite modest, can be considered clinically relevant. However, 
numerical differences between the studied Q2W and Q4W maintenance regimens were generally very 
small, and the MAH therefore agreed to a posology whereby the Q4W maintenance regimen would be 
considered standard and an increase to Q2W could be considered based on evaluation of clinical response 
on the standard regimen. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data available supports the following indication : 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The main safety data in support of the extension of indication of secukinumab to moderate to severe HS 
come from the two randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 studies of identical design, study 
M2301 and study M2302, assessing two subcutaneous secukinumab dose regimens (300 mg Q2W or 
Q4W). Pooled data are presented to assess 16 week short-term (Treatment Period 1) and 52-week long-
term safety data (Entire Study Period) up to the data cut-off dates (01 October 2021 for Study M2301 
and 23 September 2021 for Study M2302). Safety data for at least 16 weeks of treatment are available 
for all subjects. Interim long-term data up to 52-weeks was initially available for 59,1 % of the 
randomised patients. Subsequently, full 52-week long-term safety data was made available.  
The population enrolled in Studies M2301 and M2302 consisted of subjects with moderate to severe HS, 
aged ≥18 years who had a diagnosis of HS ≥1 year prior to baseline (see efficacy section for details). 
In addition, as the Q2W administration of secukinumab 300 mg has recently been approved for adult 
patients ≥90 kg with moderate to severe psoriasis in the EU, based on study A2324, a comparison of 
available safety data was performed to present findings from psoriasis and HS. 
Furthermore, the, to date, existing secukinumab safety database across all indications, with a cumulative 
exposure of 34,907.50 subject-years from 20,961 subjects and healthy volunteers in clinical studies, and 
680,470 subject-years of post-marketing exposure to secukinumab (AIN457 PSUR 26-Dec-2019 to 
25-Dec-2020) is also referred to.  
Safety evaluations consisted of frequency of AEs and SAEs, laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, 
important identified and potential risks including Infections, Hypersensitivity, Malignant or unspecified 
tumours, Suicidal ideation and behaviour, MACE and Hepatitis B reactivation, and other safety topics of 
interest, including Neutropenia, IBD and Candida infections. Given the substantial impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the recruitment and timelines of Studies M2301 and M2302, COVID-19 was also 
considered a safety topic of interest. 
All safety analyses were based on the Safety Set. The Safety Set included all subjects who received at 
least one dose of study treatment. Three subjects in Study M2301 (1 mis-randomized in IRT, 1 subject 
with severe GCP violation, and 1 subject with serious breach) and 1 subject in Study M2302 (mis-
randomized in IRT) were excluded from the Safety set as per definition.

Patient exposure 
In Treatment Period 1, the duration of exposure was similar across all treatment groups, with >97% of 
subjects exposed to treatment for at least 12 weeks and a median exposure of 112 days. 
Entire Study Period  
Initial interim (approx. 60% of patients) 52-week safety subset 
Exposure to study treatment was summarized for the pooled data (Safety set) from both of the 
phase 3 studies. The overall subject exposure during the 52-week Entire Study Period (up to the data 
cut-off dates for Studies M2301 and M2302) to secukinumab comprised 824.8 subject-years of exposure 
from studies M2301 and M2302 in the target population of adult subjects with moderate to severe HS.  
In total, 721 subjects received secukinumab in Treatment Period 1 (361 subjects in secukinumab Q2W and 
360 subjects  in  secukinumab  Q4W),  and  1060  subjects  received  secukinumab  during  the  Entire  Study 
Period (527 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 533 subjects in Any secukinumab Q4W). 
The pooled population up to Week 16 comprised 1084 subjects (secukinumab Q2W (N=361), 
secukinumab Q4W (N=360) and placebo (N=363)). From Week 16 onwards, all subjects received 
secukinumab (Any secukinumab Q2W (N=527) or Any secukinumab Q4W (N=533)). 
Overall, 93.6% of the randomized subjects completed Week 16 of the studies. Safety data for at least 
16 weeks are available for all subjects (who had completed the Week 16 visit) and long term for up to 
52 weeks, initially for 59.1% of randomized subjects. The results on the full 52-week dataset were 
subsequently provided (see below). During the Entire Study Period, duration of exposure was similar 
across all treatment groups with >56% of subjects in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups exposed to 
treatment for at least 52 weeks and a median exposure of 365 days. Median exposure for the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups was also comparable (309 vs. 302 days). 
Subsequently, the MAH provided within the response to the 1st RSI the full 52-week dataset separately 
for the two pivotal studies and eventually within the response to the 2nd RSI the requested full pooled 52-
week safety data. Exposure to study treatment is summarized for the pooled Entire Study Period in the 
updated Table 30.

Duration of exposure to study treatment is defined as min (date of the last study visit, last dose date + 84 days) minus start date of 
study treatment + 1. Subject-time in subject-years is calculated as a sum of individual subject duration in days divided by 365.25. For 
placebo-AIN457 switchers, exposure after the first intake of AIN457 is considered into any AIN457 groups. Source: [AIN457M SCS-
Table 1-6].  
The treatment groups were 1) secukinumab Q2W, 2) secukinumab Q4W, 3) Any secukinumab Q2W (combination of secukinumab 
Q2W and placebo-switchers to secukinumab Q2W), 4) Any secukinumab Q4W (combination of secukinumab Q4W and placebo-
switchers to secukinumab Q4W) and 5) Any secukinumab (all subjects who received at least one dose of secukinumab). 
Full 52-week safety data  
During the Entire Study Period, the median duration of exposure was 364 days in the Any secukinumab 
treatment group in both studies. At the time of final database lock, 72.9% of subjects in secukinumab 
Q2W group and 77.2% of subjects in secukinumab Q4W group in study M2301, and 78.3% of subjects in 
secukinumab Q2W group and 68.9% of subjects in secukinumab Q4W group in study M2302, had 
received treatment with secukinumab for ≥ 52 weeks with a cumulative secukinumab exposure of 456.2 
and 450.8 subject-years in study M2301 and M2302, respectively. The cumulative exposure was also 
comparable between the Any secukinumab Q2W and the Any secukinumab Q4W groups. 
Pooled data  
Exposure to study treatment was summarized for the pooled 52-week data from both pivotal studies. In 
total, 1060 adult subjects with moderate to severe HS received secukinumab during the Entire Study 
Period (527 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 533 subjects in Any secukinumab Q4W), with the 
overall exposure being 907.0 subject-years in studies M2301 and M2302. 
The duration of exposure for both secukinumab treatment groups was comparable in the Entire Study 
Period. 
At Week 16, subjects who were initially randomized to either of the two secukinumab regimens continued 
on  the  same  dose  regimen,  and  subjects  initially  randomized  to  Placebo  were randomized to 
either secukinumab Q2W or Q4W, following a blinded loading dose regimen. Therefore, both the 'Any 
secukinumab Q2W' and 'Any secukinumab Q4W' groups also included placebo-switchers  assigned  to 
these  regimens,  and  the  treatment  group  'Any  secukinumab' included all subjects who took at least 
one dose of secukinumab.

In  the  Entire  Study  Period,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  was  364.0  days  for  the  Any 
secukinumab treatment group, with a cumulative exposure of 907.0 subject-years. For subjects who 
switched from placebo to secukinumab at Week 16, exposure only after the first dose of secukinumab 
is counted. 
Cumulative exposure (subject-years) was similar between the secukinumab Q2W (340.2) and Q4W 
(336.5) groups and similar between the Any secukinumab Q2W group (454.0) and Any secukinumab 
Q4W group (453.0). 
Although disease history and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the treatment 
groups (see efficacy section for details), the secukinumab Q2W group comprised a more severe 
population (more subjects with Hurley stage III, higher lesion count, older age, more smokers, and more 
subjects rated ‘Very severe’ on the HS-PGA) compared to the secukinumab Q4W and placebo groups. In 
addition, consistent with the higher prevalence of subjects in Hurley III, a higher proportion of subjects in 
the secukinumab Q2W group underwent non-drug therapies and procedures (e.g., abscess excision or 
drainage) compared to the other treatment groups. Despite these differences between treatment groups, 
the demographics of the overall population were, according to the MAH, consistent with the population of 
subjects who completed the Week 52 visit up to the data cut-off date for each study. 
Study A2324 (moderate to severe psoriasis): As the Q2W administration of secukinumab 300 mg has 
recently been approved for use in PsO patients in the EU, a comparison of available safety data from 
study A2324 was performed to present findings from PsO alongside HS and provide additional long-term 
safety information for the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen. 
Based on the large secukinumab safety database across all indications studied, consisting of data from 
20,961 subjects and healthy volunteers in clinical studies, and 680,470 subject-years with post-marketing 
exposure, the cumulative exposure to secukinumab consists of 34,907.50 subject-years 
[AIN457 PSUR 26-Dec-2019 to 25-Dec-2020]. 
Based on experience with the approved dose in PsO (300 mg Q4W) and expected serum concentrations, 
two secukinumab dosing regimens were evaluated in Studies M2301 and M2302. For both dosing 
regimens, secukinumab 300 mg was administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 as loading 
injections, followed by maintenance injections on a Q2W or Q4W basis, up to Week 52 as per protocol 
schedule. No specific dose selection studies for secukinumab were conducted in patients with HS. 
Adverse events  
Safety results are presented for two separate time periods: the initial placebo-controlled period up to 
Week 16 (Treatment Period 1) and the Entire Study Period (up to the data cut-off dates for Studies 
M2301 and M2302) up to Week 52. A direct safety comparison (crude incidences) between secukinumab 
and placebo can be evaluated up to Week 16. Comparisons of safety reported during the Entire Study 
Period focus on EAIRs (expressed as incidence rates per 100 subject-years of exposure) due to the 
relative higher exposure to secukinumab compared to placebo (placebo subjects switched to secukinumab 
Q2W or Q4W after Week 16). However, treatment comparison of secukinumab to placebo for the Entire 
Study Period must be interpreted with caution due to the different durations of exposure and given that 
the AE rate may not be constant over time. 
Most frequently occurring adverse events 
Treatment Period 1  
During Treatment Period 1, the overall incidence of AEs was similar between the secukinumab treatment 
groups (65.1% and 64.4% in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, respectively) and the placebo 
group (65.0%). No meaningful differences in AE frequency or clinical relevance were reported between 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (Table 31), with the vast majority of the reported AEs being 
non-serious (approximately 98%), mild to moderate in severity (approximately 97%), and not requiring 
drug discontinuation (approximately 99%). 
As expected, based on the known safety profile of secukinumab across various indications and from risks 
related to the indication of HS, the AEs with the highest frequency were reported in the SOC of Infections 
and  infestations,  with  similar  incidences  across  the  secukinumab  groups  (30.7%  vs.  30.6%  in  the 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, respectively) and placebo group (31.7%), with the most commonly 
reported AEs being headache (10.4%), nasopharyngitis (8.0%) and (worsening of) hidradenitis (5.1%).  
Other commonly affected SOCs (≥10% of subjects in any treatment group) were Gastrointestinal 
disorders, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Nervous system disorders, General disorders and 
administration site conditions, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, with similar 
incidences across treatment groups.

Entire Study Period 
Initial interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
During the Entire Study Period, in long term AEs were consistent with those observed during Treatment 
Period 1. After adjusting for exposure, the overall incidence of AEs was lower in the Any secukinumab 
group than the placebo group (285.2 vs. 412.2 per 100 subject-years). The EAIR rate was lower for the 
secukinumab Q2W group compared to the secukinumab Q4W group (274.3 vs. 296.7 per 100 subject-
years) and for the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (266.4 
vs. 306.0 per 100 subject-years) (Table 32). 
The SOC with the highest EAIR in the Any secukinumab group was Infections and infestations, as 
reported for Treatment Period 1. A higher incidence was reported in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (92.5 vs. 84.1 per 100 subject-years), with the most 
reported PT being nasopharyngitis. No differences were observed in the EAIRs of other SOCs between the 
secukinumab dose regimens. 
The most commonly reported (≥10 per 100 subject-years) AEs by PT in the Any secukinumab group were 
headache (20.9 per 100 subject-years), (worsening of) hidradenitis and nasopharyngitis (both 
14.8 per 100 subject-years). No meaningful differences in AE frequency or clinical relevance were 
reported between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, with the majority (approximately 98%) of the 
reported AEs being non-serious, mild to moderate in severity (approximately 97%) not requiring drug 
discontinuation (approximately 99%). 
Full 52-week safety dataset  
There were no new treatment-emergent safety signals identified during the long-term exposure of 
secukinumab, with the safety profile over the entire study period being similar to Treatment Period 1. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

overall incidence of AEs for both treatment groups was 83.9% in study M2301 and 80.8% in study 
M2302. 
Consistent with the reported Week 16 data, for the Entire Study Period, the overall EAIR for AEs was 
lower in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (274.6 per 100 subject-years) compared to the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group (301.6 per 100 subject-years), with no specific SOCs or PTs driving the 
difference. ‘Infections and infestations’ was the most commonly reported SOC with a higher incidence in 
the Any secukinumab Q2W group (94.0 per 100 subject-years) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W 
group (87.9 per 100 subject-years). Most of the individual events in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ 
(>96%) were non-serious, mild (approximately 70%) or moderate (approximately 28%) in severity and 
did not lead to treatment discontinuation (only approximately 1% of AEs resulted in permanent treatment 
withdrawal). As was reported in the Week 16 SCS, the most frequent AEs over the Entire Study Period 
(>5%) included headache, (worsening of) hidradenitis, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea and upper respiratory 
tract infection, with similar frequencies between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. 
Adverse events by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
Study M2301 
The Exposure Adjusted Incidence Rate (EAIR) of overall AEs in the Entire Study Period was slightly lower 
in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (291.8 per 100 subject years (SY)) than in the Any secukinumab 
Q4W group (325.2 per 100 SY). 
‘Infections and infestations’ was the most commonly reported SOC, with higher incidence in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group (97.1 per 100 SY) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (82.0 per 
100 SY). Other commonly reported AEs by SOCs in the Any secukinumab group were ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (53.9 per 100 SY), ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ (33.5 per 100 SY), ‘Nervous 
system disorders’ (28.0 per 100 SY), ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ (23.7 per 
100 SY), ‘Investigations’ (20.9 per 100 SY), and ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ 
(20.1 per 100 SY), with all SOCs showing generally comparable incidence rates in the Any secukinumab 
Q2W and Q4W dose groups.  
The most commonly reported AEs by PT were headache (19.5 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q2W; 
23.5 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q4W), nasopharyngitis (20 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q2W; 
13.9% per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q4W), and (worsening of) hidradenitis (14.7 per 100 SY in Any 
secukinumab Q2W; 13.9 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q4W). The incidence of the AEs of 
nasopharyngitis and pruritus were numerically higher in the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to 
the Any secukinumab Q4W group; the incidence of the AEs of diarrhea, headache, nausea, influenza, and 
fatigue were numerically higher in the Any secukinumab Q4W group than in the secukinumab Q2W group. 
Study M2302  
The EAIR of overall AEs in the entire study period was comparable between the Any secukinumab 
Q2W group (258.6 per 100 SY) and the Any secukinumab Q4W group (280.2 per 100 SY). 
‘Infections and infestations’ was the most commonly reported SOC, with similar incidence between the 
secukinumab treatment groups [Any secukinumab Q2W group (91.0 per 100 SY) compared to the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group (94.2 per 100 SY)]. Other commonly reported AEs by SOCs in the Any 
secukinumab group were ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (38.1 per 100 SY), ‘Gastrointestinal 
disorders’ (32.4 per 100 SY), ‘Nervous system disorders’ (26.6 per 100 SY), and ‘Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders’ (20.0 per 100 SY), with all SOCs showing generally comparable incidences 
between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. 
The most commonly reported AEs in the Any secukinumab group were headache (19.3 per 100 SY in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W and 18.1 per 100 SY in the Any secukinumab Q4W group), (worsening of) 
Assessment report

hidradenitis (13.1 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q2W and 14.9 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab 
Q4W group), and nasopharyngitis (13.3 per 100 SY in Any secukinumab Q2W and 11.9 per 100 SY in Any 
secukinumab Q4W group). The incidences of other AEs were low and comparable between the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. The incidences of AEs of hypertension, pruritus, 
influenza and sweat gland infection were numerically higher in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group; the incidences of back pain and upper abdominal pain 
were numerically higher in the Any secukinumab Q4W group than the secukinumab Q2W group.

- A subject with multiple adverse events within a primary system organ class is counted only once in the 
system organ class. 
- EX = Exposure per 100 subject-years. IR = Incidence rate per 100 subject-years. For subjects with multiple 
events within the preferred term, exposure time is censored at time of first event. 
- Primary system organ classes are sorted in descending order of frequency in Any AIN457 group. 
Severity of adverse events 
Adverse events for both the first 16 weeks (Treatment Period 1) and over the Entire Study Period were 
mostly mild or moderate in severity, with severe events occurring at low frequency (<7%). No imbalance 
was seen in the severity of AEs between the secukinumab and the placebo groups in Treatment Period 1. 
The incidence of severe AEs was similar between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab 
Q4W groups in the Entire Study Period. There was no clustering or pattern of events which would suggest 
any increased risk of severe events in the secukinumab dose groups over the Entire Study Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 112/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment Period 1 
The majority of AEs reported during Treatment Period 1 were mild (occurring in 40.7% of subjects in 
secukinumab Q2W, 42.8% in secukinumab Q4W and 36.4% of subjects in placebo) or moderate (21.6% 
in secukinumab Q2W, 19.2% in secukinumab Q4W and 23.4% in placebo group) in severity. During 
Treatment Period 1, severe AEs were reported with a similar incidence in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W 
groups (2.8% vs. 2.5%) and a slightly higher incidence in the placebo group (5.2%). 
By PT, no severe events were reported in more than one subject in any treatment group, with the 
exception of fatigue (3 subjects in the placebo group) and (worsening of) hidradenitis (2 subjects in the 
secukinumab Q4W group and 5 subjects in the placebo group). 
Entire Study Period 
Initial interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
Most treatment-emergent AEs during the Entire Study Period in the secukinumab groups were mild 
(37.0% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 40.5% in Any secukinumab Q4W, 38.8% in Any secukinumab) or 
moderate (33.6% of subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W, 31.9% in Any secukinumab Q4W, 32.7% in Any 
secukinumab) in severity. Severe events were of low frequency in all groups (<7%). The incidence of 
severe AEs was similar between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups (6.3% 
and 6.8%, respectively). The most frequent severe AEs reported for both the secukinumab groups were 
in the SOC for Infections and infestations (2.5% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1.9% in Any Q4W). 
Additional severe events were reported at low frequencies from the Treatment Period 1. There was no 
clustering or pattern of events which would suggest any increased risk of severe events in the 
secukinumab groups over the Entire Study Period. All severe AEs (PTs) were in ≤3 subjects except for 
(worsening of) hidradenitis reported in 4 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and in 6 subjects in Any 
secukinumab Q4W. No specific trends were observed for any of the severe AEs. 
Full 52-week safety dataset 
Adverse events during both Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study Period were mostly mild or 
moderate in severity, with no imbalance seen in the severity of AEs between the secukinumab and the 
placebo groups. The proportion of subjects with mild AEs during the Entire Study Period in the 
secukinumab groups were 38.5% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 41.7% in Any secukinumab Q4W, and 
those with moderate AEs were 35.9% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 34.7% in Any secukinumab Q4W 
groups. Severe events were reported with similar incidence in the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any 
secukinumab Q4W groups (7% and 6.9%, respectively). The most frequent severe AEs reported for both 
the secukinumab groups were in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ (2.7% in Any secukinumab Q2W 
and 2.1% in Any secukinumab Q4W). All severe AEs (PTs) were in ≤3 subjects, with the exceptions of the 
following: 
• 
(Worsening of) Hidradenitis (4 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 7 subjects in Any 
secukinumab Q4W): considered not related to study treatment (except in one subject), transient 
and resolved with or without treatment (except 3 subjects), not leading to study treatment 
discontinuation. Three cases occurred before starting study treatment. 
•  Headache (3 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1 subject in Any secukinumab Q4W): 
considered related in one case, transient and resolved with or without treatment. All subjects 
completed the study with no treatment interruption. 
•  Sweat gland infection (4 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1 subject in Any secukinumab 
Q4W): associated with worsening of HS lesions, considered related in one case, all resolved. All 
subjects completed the study, with 1 subject interrupting and 1 subject discontinuing the study 
treatment

Potential relationship of adverse events to study treatment 
Treatment Period 1  
Adverse events that were suspected to be related to study drug were reported at similar frequencies in 
the secukinumab groups compared to placebo up in Treatment Period 1 (19.8% in Any secukinumab, 
22.0% in placebo). There was no meaningful difference in AEs related to study drug between the 
secukinumab dose regimens (18.6% in secukinumab Q2W and 21.1% in secukinumab Q4W). 
Most of the AEs related to study treatment (≥ 1% in secukinumab groups) were events such as fatigue 
(1.7% in secukinumab Q2W, 3.1% in secukinumab Q4W and 1.4% in placebo), diarrhea (1.7% in 
secukinumab Q2W, 1.1% in secukinumab Q4W and 3.6% in placebo), headache (1.4% in 
secukinumab Q2W, 1.4% in secukinumab Q4W and 0.6% in placebo), upper respiratory tract infections 
(1.1% in secukinumab Q2W, 0.8% in secukinumab Q4W and 0.6% in placebo), (worsening of) 
hidradenitis (1.1% in secukinumab Q2W, 0.3% in secukinumab Q4W and 1.4% in placebo) and asthenia 
(1.1% in secukinumab Q2W, 0.3% in secukinumab Q4W and 0.6% in placebo). All of these AEs suspected 
to be related to study drug were non-serious, mild to moderate, and did not lead to study discontinuation 
except for one case of headache in secukinumab Q2W which was considered severe but did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation, and one case of (worsening of) hidradenitis in placebo suspected to be related 
to study treatment was considered serious and did not led to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Entire Study Period 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the incidence of treatment-related AEs between the 
Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. Adverse events that were suspected to be 
related to study drug were reported at similar frequencies in the secukinumab groups compared to 
placebo in Treatment Period 1 and between the two secukinumab dose groups in the Entire Study Period. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the incidence of treatment-related AEs between the 
Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. In addition, the types of treatment-related 
AEs reported during the Entire Study Period were consistent with those reported in Treatment Period 1. 
Adverse drug reactions update  
In order to update the current list of ADRs for secukinumab, data pooling was performed from 
secukinumab studies in multiple indications including HS, PsO, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA. The following 
sources and cut-off dates obtained from previous submission packages (placebo-controlled period) were 
utilized for the creation of the updated ADR table: 
•  HS [Study M2301] and [Study M2302] – up to Week 16 
• 
• 
PsO [Study CAIN457A2302], [Study CAIN457A2303], [Study CAIN457A2308] and 
[Study CAIN457A2309] – up to Week 12 
PsA [Study CAIN457F2306] and [Study CAIN457F2312] – up to Week 16 
•  AS [Study CAIN457F2305] and [Study CAIN457F2310] – up to Week 16 
•  nr-axSpA [Study CAIN457H2315] – up to Week 16 
The following ADRs were identified and classified based on their frequency category: 
•  Very common: Upper respiratory tract infection (HLT) 
•  Common: Fatigue, diarrhea, headache, oral herpes, nausea, rhinorrhea 
•  Uncommon: Oral candidiasis, IBD, otitis externa, conjunctivitis, lower respiratory tract infection, 
neutropenia, tenia pedis, dyshidrotic eczema and urticaria. Note: For ADR ‘tinea pedis’ the frequency 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 114/158 
 
 
 
 
category changed from previously identified category ‘common’ to ‘uncommon’ because of MedDRA 
version update. 
•  Rare: Anaphylactic reactions 
Of note, there were no cases of anaphylactic reaction during the conduct of the studies. 
Since there is no case of hypersensitivity vasculitis or exfoliative dermatitis within the pool of data used 
to update the ADR table, the currently approved frequency category of both terms (as per procedure 
IAIN-0081 for hypersensitivity vasculitis and procedure IAIN-0054 for exfoliative dermatitis) is kept. 
Comparison of adverse events between HS studies and Study A2324 
The overall safety profile of the secukinumab Q2W dose regimen in HS (pooled data from Studies M2301 
and M2302) was comparable to that of moderate to severe PsO (Study A2324). While the overall EAIR of 
treatment-emergent AEs was higher in HS than in PsO subjects (HS studies: 266.4 in Any secukinumab 
Q2W and 306.0 in Any secukinumab Q4W; Study A2324: 176.1 in Any secukinumab Q2W and 180.2 in 
Any secukinumab Q4W), it is important to note that there was no difference in the incidence of AEs 
between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W regimens within each indication.  
The higher EAIRs (per 100 subject-years) of AEs in HS was primarily driven by differences in the 
Infections and infestations SOC (HS studies: 92.5 in Any secukinumab Q2W, 84.1 in Any secukinumab 
Q4W; Study A2324: 62.2 in Any secukinumab Q2W, 71.5 in Any secukinumab Q4W), with the difference 
largely driven by nasopharyngitis. Notably, the HS development program was conducted in the midst of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, which was announced when approximately 80% of the population was enrolled. 
The differences between HS and PsO are also likely linked to disease-specific aspects (i.e., HS population 
presenting with a higher inflammatory burden and broad spectrum of associated comorbidities, as well as 
open wounds) and highlighted by the higher EAIRs of PTs often reported as associated with HS (i.e., 
headache, (worsening of) hidradenitis and diarrhoea) (Reddy et al 2019, Ring et al 2017).

Table 35 for study M2301 and Table 36 for study M2302). 
Study M2301 
No deaths were reported during the entire treatment duration. 
After the Week 16 primary analysis cut-off date (01-Oct-2021), non-fatal SAEs were reported in 3 new 
subjects (5 new SAEs), while there were no additional patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment (more details are presented in the serious adverse events section below). 
Overall, the incidence of non-fatal SAEs was similar between the Any secukinumab Q2W (18 subjects, 
6.8%) and Q4W (19 subjects, 7.1%) groups. The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment was also similar in the Any secukinumab Q2W (11 subjects, 4.1%) and Q4W (7 subjects, 
2.6%) groups ( 
Table 35).

Study M2302 
No new deaths or new subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported 
since the primary analysis cut-off date (23-Sep-2021). Five additional subjects reported non-fatal SAEs 
since the primary analysis cut-off date (more details are presented in the serious adverse events section 
below). 
Overall, the incidence of non-fatal SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation was similar between the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. Non-fatal SAEs were reported in 22 (8.4%) 
subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and 21 (7.9%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W 
group. Nine (3.4%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued the study treatment due to 
any AEs, compared to 10 (3.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (Table 36).

Serious adverse events 
Treatment Period 1  
In Treatment Period 1, the incidence of SAEs was low and comparable for both secukinumab regimens 
and placebo (2.5% for both secukinumab Q2W and secukinumab Q4W versus 3.0% for placebo) with no 
pattern in the type of event reported. The most commonly reported SAEs for secukinumab in Treatment 
Period 1 were in the SOC Infections and infestations (Table 38). 
SAEs in the SOC of Infections and infestations occurred at a similar frequency in the placebo group and 
the Any secukinumab group (5 subjects (0.7%, 1 in secukinumab Q2W and 4 in secukinumab Q4W) in 
Any secukinumab versus 3 subjects (0.8%) in placebo). SAEs in the SOCs of Cardiac disorders, 
Hepatobiliary disorders, Immune system disorders, Musculoskeletal and connective disorders and 
Psychiatric disorders were reported only in the secukinumab groups, with low rates of ≤0.3%, involving 
1-2 subjects, in both secukinumab groups.  
All reported SAEs were in single subjects with the exception of (worsening of) hidradenitis SAEs, which 
were reported in 2 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W and in 2 subjects in placebo group. There were no 
serious cases of (worsening of) hidradenitis in the secukinumab Q4W group. All cases of (worsening of) 
hidradenitis which were serious were of moderate severity and did not lead to study treatment 
discontinuation. During Treatment Period 1, 5 SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment. 
These included PTs of suicide attempt, urinary tract infection, colitis ulcerative (one subject each in 
secukinumab Q2W), inflammatory bowel disease (one subject in secukinumab Q4W) and hidradenitis 
(one subject in placebo).

SAEs in Treatment Period 1 for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection  
SAEs that occurred in Treatment Period 1 in subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection 
were reported only within the placebo group (n=2), with SAEs of COVID-19 pneumonia and glomerular 
vascular disorder.  
Entire Study Period 
The incidence rates of SAEs in the Entire Study Period were low and comparable among the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W treatment groups. 
Study M2301 
Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs during the entire study period was 6.8% in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and 7.1% in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. Most SAEs were reported by one 
subject each, except for (worsening of) hidradenitis which was reported in 4 (1.5%) subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and 4 (1.5%) subjects in Any secukinumab Q4W group, sweat gland infection which 
was reported in 3 (1.1%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group compared to 1 (0.4%) subject in 
the Any secukinumab Q2W group and pneumonia which was reported in 2 (0.7%) subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group compared to none in the Any secukinumab Q2W group. 
After the Week 16 PEA, 5 SAEs were reported in 3 new subjects (2 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W 
group, PTs: suicidal ideation, goitre; 1 subject in the placebo Q4W group, PT: peritonsillar abscess). In 
addition, 2 new SAEs (PTs: hidradenitis, sweat gland infection) were reported in a subject in the 
secukinumab Q4Wgroup who already experienced a SAEs prior to the PEA cut-off. All these SAEs

resolved, and they were not considered to be causally related to secukinumab. 
Study M2302 
The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs during the entire study period was 8.4% in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and 8.6% in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. Most SAEs were reported by one 
subject each, except for (worsening of) hidradenitis which was reported in 5 (1.9%) subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group compared to none in the Any secukinumab Q4W group, and acute kidney injury 
and pyrexia which were each reported by 2 (0.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to none in the Any secukinumab Q4W group; conversely, intravertebral disc protrusion was 
reported in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the Any secukinumab Q4W group compared to none in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group. 
After the Week 16 PEA, 9 SAEs were reported in 5 new subjects (4 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W 
group, PTs: depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, nephrolithiasis, acute kidney injury, 
abdominoplasty; 1 subject in the placebo Q4W group, PT: joint dislocation). In addition, 3 new SAEs 
(PTs: pyrexia, acute kidney injury, hypotension) were reported in a subject in the secukinumab Q2W 
group who already experienced an SAE prior to the PEA cut-off. All these SAEs were not suspected by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment. 
Pooled data (studies M2301 and M2302) 
At Week 16, the incidence rates of SAEs in the Entire Study Period were low and comparable among the 
Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W treatment groups. In addition, the general profile of 
SAEs during the Entire Study Period was comparable to Treatment Period 1. 
In the Entire Study Period, the crude incidence of SAEs were 7.6% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 7.9% in 
Any secukinumab Q4W. The most commonly reported SAEs for secukinumab during the Entire Study 
Period were in the SOCs Infections and infestations (3.3% in Any secukinumab) and Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (1.2% in Any secukinumab). The rest of the SAEs in the other SOCs 
showed low rates (≤0.5% in Any secukinumab), involving 1-2 subjects (by PT), in either of the Any 
secukinumab treatment groups. 
All SAEs (PTs) occurred in ≤3 subjects, with the exception of SAEs of (worsening of) hidradenitis and 
sweat gland infections (PTs), which was reported in 13 and 6 subjects in the Any secukinumab group, 
respectively. This is expected considering the recurring nature of HS, and the disease severity in these 
subjects with most having Hurley Stage III disease. During the Entire Study Period, 16 SAEs were 
suspected to be related to study treatment. These included 9 SAEs in subjects in the Any secukinumab 
Q2W group (hidradenitis, abscess, large intestine infection, skin candida, sweat gland infection, suicide 
attempt, urinary tract infection, colitis ulcerative and systemic inflammatory response syndrome), 6 
SAEs in subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonia, 
hidradenitis, influenza, scrotal inflammation, and cellulitis) and one in a subject on placebo 
(hidradenitis). 
No clinically meaningful differences in the EAIRs of total SAEs were observed across the treatment 
groups (9.4 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab and 10.1 per 100 subject-years in placebo) nor 
between the secukinumab dose regimen groups (9.1 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q2W 
and 9.6 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q4W). Narratives for subjects with SAEs were 
provided.

In the Entire Study Period, the incidence of SAEs was low and comparable for both secukinumab groups 
(6.6% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 7.5% in Any secukinumab Q4W) with no pattern in the type of events 
reported. The general profile of SAEs over the Entire Study Period was comparable to Treatment Period 1. 
The most commonly reported SAEs for secukinumab during the Entire Study Period were from the SOC 
Infections and infestations (3.1% in Any secukinumab), primarily due to Sweat gland infection (0.4%) 
and Cellulitis (0.3%), and the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (1.1% in Any secukinumab), 
due to (worsening of) hidradenitis (1.1%). The rest of the SAEs in the other SOCs showed low rates 
of ≤0.5% (in Any secukinumab), involving 1-2 subjects (by PT), in both Any secukinumab treatment 
groups. No clinically meaningful differences in the incidence rates of SAEs by SOCs were observed across 
the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups. 
No clinically meaningful differences in the EAIRs of total SAEs were observed across the treatment groups 
(9.4 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab and 10.1 per 100 subject-years in placebo) or between 
the secukinumab dose regimen groups (8.7 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q2W and 
10.1 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q4W). The EAIRs of SAEs in the SOC Infections and 
infestations were comparable in the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W groups 
2.7 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q2W versus 5.5 per 100 subject-years in Any 
secukinumab Q4W).  
All SAEs (PTs) were in ≤3 subjects except for the SAEs of (worsening of) hidradenitis, which was reported 
in 9 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and in 3 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. 
No specific trend was observed for any of the SAEs. During the Entire Study Period, 15 SAEs were 
suspected to be related to study treatment. In addition to PTs noted in Treatment Period 1, these 
included 5 SAEs in subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (hidradenitis, abscess, large intestine 
infection, skin candida and systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and 5 SAEs in subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group (pneumonia, hidradenitis, influenza, scrotal inflammation, and cellulitis). 
Full 52-week safety dataset 
In the Entire Study Period, the incidence of AEs causing discontinuation was comparable between the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. 
Study M2301 
No additional subjects who discontinued study treatment due to AEs were reported since the Week 16 
PEA cut-off date (01-Oct-2021). 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and similar in both Any secukinumab 
Q2W and Q4W groups. In total, 11 subjects (4.1%) in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued 
study treatment due to AEs compared to 7 subjects (2.6%) in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. All these 
events were isolated incidences, and each of them were reported in no more than 1 subject. At the final 
DBL, in 3 subjects (1 each in the secukinumab Q2W (PT: hidradenitis), secukinumab Q4W (PT: 
hidradenitis), and placebo-Q2W (PT: hematemesis) groups) the action taken with study treatment due to 
AE was updated compared to the Week 16 PEA from “drug withdrawn” to “dose not changed”. 
At time of the final DBL, the action taken with the study treatment due to AE (ear infection) was updated 
from “drug interrupted” to “drug withdrawn” in 1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group, and one 
additional AE (PT: impetigo) leading to discontinuation was reported for a subject in the placebo-Q4W 
group who had already reported treatment discontinuation due to an AE of fungal external otitis (i.e., 
subject discontinued treatment due to these two AEs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 121/158 
 
 
 
 
Study M2302 
At the time of the final DBL, no additional subjects who discontinued study treatment due to AEs were 
reported since the Week 16 PEA cut-off date (23-Sep-2021). 
As reported in the Week 16 CSR, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and similar in 
both the Any secukinumab Q2W and the Any secukinumab Q4W groups. At Week 52 final analysis, nine 
(3.4%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued study treatment due to AEs compared 
to 10 (3.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. All these events were isolated incidences, 
each reported in only one subject, and the majority of them were not suspected to be related to study 
treatment. 
Pooled data 
In total, 20 (3.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued study treatment due to AEs 
compared to 17 (3.2%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. Two AEs caused discontinuation in 
more than one subject: (worsening of) hidradenitis and abdominal pain, both in 1 subject each in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. The events of (worsening of) hidradenitis and abdominal pain were 
non-serious. Adverse events of (worsening of) hidradenitis were mostly events of recurrence or flares of 
HS . All other PTs were isolated events with each reported in no more than 1 subject. Narratives for 
subjects with AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were provided. 
Comparison of serious adverse events between HS studies and study A2324 
The EAIRs of SAEs in subjects treated with secukinumab in the Entire Study Period was comparable 
between the HS population (Studies M2301 and M2302) and the psoriasis population (Study A2324) for 
Any secukinumab Q2W (8.7 and 8.8 per 100 subject-years, respectively) and was comparable in the 
psoriasis population for Any secukinumab Q4W (10.1 and 14.0 per 100 subject-years, respectively). All 
SAEs (PTs) were in ≤ 3 subjects except (worsening of) hidradenitis SAE, which was reported in 9 subjects 
in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and in 3 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group in the two HS 
studies only. 
Safety topics of interest 
Safety topics of interest for secukinumab were evaluated up to Week 16 (Treatment Period 1) and for the 
Entire Study Period, based upon reported treatment-emergent AEs for all treatment groups: compound 
and class-related risks, important identified risks, important potential risks, and other safety topics of 
interest. Along with the Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ), risks were also identified using customized 
Company MedDRA Queries (NMQ). 
Treatment Period 1 
Compound and class-related risks  
Compound and class-related risks reported during Treatment Period 1 included various infections 
(Infectious pneumonia, Fungal infections, Viral herpes, Skin structure infections and Staphylococcal 
infections) as well as malignancies [Malignant or unspecified tumours (except non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC), Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] and Skin tumours 
(malignant or unspecified). 
The most frequently reported compound and class-related risk was Infections of skin structures (NMQ), 
with a comparable incidence in the two secukinumab groups (13.0% in the secukinumab Q2W group, 
14.2% in the secukinumab Q4W group) and a slightly higher incidence in the placebo group (17.6%). The 
Assessment report

incidence of Infectious pneumonia (SMQ broad), Herpes viral infections (HLT) and Staphylococcal 
infections (HLT) was also comparable between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups and placebo. 
The incidence of Fungal infectious disorder (HLGT) was slightly higher in the secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to the secukinumab Q4W and placebo groups (5.3% in secukinumab Q2W, 3.9% in 
secukinumab Q4W, 2.8% in placebo). The PTs were all muco-cutaneous events. Although there is a small 
numerical difference between the secukinumab dose regimens and placebo for the incidence of fungal 
infections, this difference was not clinically important as all cases were non-serious, manageable with 
standard therapy and of limited duration. There was no pattern observed in terms of latency, the PTs 
included predominantly vulvovaginal mycotic infections and skin candida. Approximately 21% of subjects 
affected by Fungal infectious disorder (HLGT) were in Hurley stage III and 81% had previous exposure to 
systemic antibiotics. All events were mild to moderate and at the time of data cut-off approximately 90% 
of the events that occurred in Treatment Period 1 were considered resolved and none led to study 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
One subject in the secukinumab Q2W group discontinued study treatment due to sinusitis and 1 subject 
in the placebo group discontinued study treatment due to upper respiratory tract infection. 
The incidence of malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ excl BCC and SCC) (NMQ), non-melanoma skin 
cancer (BCC and SCC) (NMQ) (broad) and skin tumours malignant and unspecified (NMQ) (broad) was 
low (5 subjects in the secukinumab Q4W group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). No AEs related to 
these risks were reported in the secukinumab Q2W group. 
Important identified and potential risks 
Important identified risks for secukinumab include Infections and Hypersensitivity, the incidence of which 
were comparable between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups and placebo. The risk of Infections and 
infestations (SOC) had the highest incidence of all safety topics of interest during Treatment Period 1.  
Important potential risks for secukinumab include Malignant or unspecified tumours, MACE, Suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and Hepatitis B reactivation. Of these important potential risks, only Malignant or 
unspecified tumors (SMQ) and Suicide/self-injury (SMQ) were reported during Treatment Period 1 (Table 
39); the incidence of these events was similar between secukinumab and placebo.  
Within the Malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ) category, events included anal cancer stage 0, 
squamous cell carcinoma in-situ lesions of the vulva and vulval cancer (1 subject in the 
secukinumab Q4W group), basal cell carcinoma (right clavicle) (1 subject in the secukinumab Q4W 
group), small papillary urothelial benign tumor (urinary tract neoplasm) (1 subject in the placebo group) 
and metastatic lung cancer (1 subject in the placebo group).

Other safety topics of interest 
Based on the known safety profile of secukinumab, other safety topics of interest included IBD (AEs by 
PTs of IBD, ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease), Neutropenia (by CTCAE grade) and Candida infections 
(HLT) within the identified risk of ‘Infections’. Given that Studies M2301 and M2302 were undertaken 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 infection (suspected and confirmed cases) was also considered 
a safety topic of interest. The overall incidence of these safety topics of interest was rare and generally 
balanced across the treatment groups with no treatment-emergent signals identified. 
An increased risk of IBD is known to occur in patients with HS. New onset IBD was rare and reported in 
only 2 subjects during Treatment Period 1. One subject in the secukinumab Q2W treatment group 
discontinued study treatment due to an SAE of ulcerative colitis and 1 subject in the 
secukinumab Q4W group discontinued study treatment due to an SAE of IBD. Both cases were considered 
by the Investigator to be related to study treatment.  
Neutropenia was also rare, and mostly grade 1 or 2 events. Grade 3 neutropenia (<1.0 - 0.5 x 10E9/L) 
was reported in 2 subjects (1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group and 1 subject in the placebo group). 
Both subjects had normal baseline values. The subject on placebo experienced grade 3 neutropenia at 
Week 16; this was a single event and the subject's neutrophil count returned to normal at a subsequent 
visit. The subject on secukinumab Q2W with grade 3 neutropenia (single event) improved to grade 2 
and 1 at the subsequent visits. Both subjects completed treatment and the study. There were no grade 4 
neutropenia events. 
The incidence of Candida infections (HLT: including PTs of oral candidiasis, skin candida, vulvovaginal 
candidiasis, candida infection and balanitis candida) was low, with a similar incidence reported across all 
treatment groups (1.9% in the secukinumab Q2W group and 1.7% in both the secukinumab Q4W and 
placebo groups). The majority of these cases were non-serious and manageable. 
In addition, there were 13 suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported during Treatment 
Period 1 (6 cases in the secukinumab Q2W group, 3 in the secukinumab Q4W group and 4 in the placebo 
group). The majority of these cases of COVID-19 infection were mild, all cases resolved, and none led to 
study discontinuation. 
Entire Study Period 
Interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
Compound and class-related risks 
With respect to EAIRs, the most frequently reported compound and class-related risk was Infections of 
skin structures (NMQ), as observed during Treatment Period 1, known to be a complication of HS. The 
EAIR of this risk was comparable in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (40.0 and 40.9 per 100 
subject-years) and in Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (41.6 and 41.8 subject-years). The EAIR of 
the other risks related to infections was generally comparable between the treatment groups, with the 
exception of Fungal infectious disorder (HLGT), which was higher in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (Any secukinumab Q2W: 14.4 per 100 subject-years; Any 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

secukinumab Q4W: 9.7 per 100 subject-years; placebo: 9.1 per 100 subject-years). Consistent with the 
AEs reported during Treatment Period 1, the AEs of fungal infection by PT were all muco-cutaneous 
events, except for 1 case of onychomycosis. The PTs predominantly included skin candida, vulvovaginal 
mycotic infections, and oral candidiasis. Oesophageal candidiasis (NMQ, narrow) was reported in 1 
subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group; no cases of oesophageal candidiasis were reported in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W group. Approximately 35% of subjects affected by Fungal infectious disorder 
(HLGT) were in Hurley stage III and approximately 83% had previous exposure to systemic antibiotics. 
All events were of mild to moderate severity, except for 3 events that were severe, and, at the time of 
data cut-off, approximately 82% were considered resolved; only two cases led to study treatment 
interruption and two cases led to study treatment discontinuation. 
The majority of these cases were non-serious and managed with topical anti-fungal agents. In the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group, there was one serious event of skin candida (worsening of inguinal intertrigo, 
an event ongoing in Treatment Period 1) in a subject who switched from placebo to Any secukinumab 
Q2W in Treatment Period 2, the event was considered serious, suspected to be related to study treatment 
and led to discontinuation of the study treatment.  
Three additional subjects discontinued study treatment due to an infection: a serious event of worsening 
of scrotal infection was reported in 1 subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (severe and not 
suspected to be related to study treatment), vulvovaginal candidiasis in 1 subject in the secukinumab 
Q4W group (non-serious, severe and suspected to be related to study treatment and large intestinal 
infection in 1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group (serious event of infectious colitis, severe and 
suspected to be related to study treatment).  
The EAIRs incidence of Malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ excl BCC and SCC) (NMQ), Non-melanoma 
skin cancer (BCC and SCC) (NMQ, broad) and skin tumours malignant and unspecified (NMQ, broad) was 
low (2 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W group, 5 subjects in the secukinumab Q4W group and 2 subjects 
in the placebo group). 
Important identified and potential risks 
As observed during Treatment Period 1, in the Entire Study Period, ‘Infections’ was also the most 
frequently reported risk. EAIRs for the Infections and infestations (SOC) were higher in the secukinumab 
Q2W vs. Q4W groups (92.9 and 85.6 subject-years) and in the Any secukinumab Q2W vs. Q4W groups 
(94.0 and 84.7 subject-years). EAIRs for Hypersensitivity (SMQ, narrow) were reported at a similar 
incidence in all treatment groups. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in either study. 
Important potential risks of malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ), suicide/self-injury (SMQ), and 
MACE (NMQ) events were each reported in ≤2 subjects in any treatment group during the Entire Study 
Period, with no imbalance or treatment-emergent signals identified. No events related to the risk of 
Hepatitis B reactivation were reported.  
Events of MACE (NMQ) were reported in 2 subjects (1 in the secukinumab Q4W group and 1 in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group). Both cases were considered not related to study treatment and occurred in 
subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. 
Within the Malignant or unspecified tumours (SMQ) category, events included anal cancer stage 0, 
squamous cell carcinoma in-situ lesions of the vulva and vulval cancer (1 subject in the 
secukinumab Q4W group) and basal cell carcinoma (right clavicle) (1 subject in the secukinumab Q4W 
group), as reported during Treatment Period 1. In addition, breast carcinoma (1 subject in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group) and lung neoplasm and metastatic NSCLC (1 subject in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group) were reported.

Other safety topics of interest 
Consistent with data from Treatment Period 1, AEs in the category of safety topics of interest were rare 
during the Entire Study Period and generally balanced between the treatment groups. 
New-onset IBD was rare and reported in only 1 subject in the Entire Study Period compared to Treatment 
Period 1. This subject, in the Any secukinumab Q2W group, presented with Crohn’s disease, which was 
non-serious, of moderate severity and led to study treatment discontinuation.  
Neutropenia was also rare with mostly grade 1 or 2 events reported during the Entire Study Period. 
Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 1 additional subject (Any secukinumab Q2W) compared to 
Treatment Period 1 and grade 4 neutropenia was reported in 2 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W 
group. The subject with grade 3 neutropenia had a normal absolute neutrophil count at baseline, and the 
result of grade 3 neutropenia was an isolated event; the subject's neutrophil count values returned to 
normal at the subsequent visit. For the 2 subjects with grade 4 neutropenia, these had been single 
events, the subjects had a normal absolute neutrophil count at baseline and normal values at subsequent 
visits. All subjects completed treatment and the study. 
The incidence of Candida infections (HLT: which mainly consisted of the PTs of oral candidiasis, skin 
candida and vulvovaginal candidiasis) was low, with an incidence of 4.7% in the Any secukinumab Q2W 
group and 3.6% in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. 
In addition, there were 48 suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported during the Entire Study 
Period, with no imbalance across treatment groups. Despite ongoing immunosuppressive secukinumab 
treatment, the majority of these cases of COVID-19 infection were mild, all cases resolved with 
conventional therapies, treatment was interrupted in a few cases (n=34) for an average of 4 weeks, with 
the majority of subjects missing only 1 dose (range: 1 to 8 weeks) and none discontinuing study 
treatment. 
Full 52-week safety dataset 
Study M2301  
The incidence of AEs within the Infections and infestations SOC during the Entire Study Period was higher 
in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (52.6%) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (47.6%). 
Overall, most Infections and infestations (SOC) were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and 
recovered without the need for treatment discontinuation. 
The most commonly reported infection-related AEs were related to upper respiratory tract infections 
(HLT), with slightly higher incidence in the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group (25.2% and 21.7%, respectively), and mainly (incidence ≥ 5%) consisted of the 
PTs nasopharyngitis (15.0% in Any secukinumab Q2W; 10.9% in Any secukinumab Q4W) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (4.5% in Any secukinumab Q2W; 6.4% in Any secukinumab Q4W). 
Hypersensitivity (SMQ, narrow) was reported in 13.2% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
and 12.0% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. 
Eczema was the most frequently reported AE (3.4% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 3.4% in Any 
secukinumab Q4W), followed by rash (2.3% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1.9% in Any secukinumab 
Q4W), dermatitis (1.5% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1.9% in Any secukinumab Q4W), and contact 
dermatitis (1.1% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 2.2% in Any secukinumab Q4W). Most hypersensitivity 
cases were either mild or moderate, non-serious, generally resolved with treatment and without study 
treatment discontinuation, and were considered not related to study treatment. No AEs of anaphylaxis 
were reported.

One new case of suicidal ideation and behavior with the PT of suicidal ideation was reported since the PEA 
cut-off date (01-Oct-2021) in a subject in the secukinumab Q2W group on Day 278. The event was 
considered serious, and the drug was interrupted due to the event. The subject had active medical 
conditions of depression and anxiety ongoing since 2011. The subject was treated with diazepam ethyl 
loflazepate, venlafaxine, and trazodone. The event was reported as resolving upon treatment and was not 
suspected by the Investigator and the sponsor to be related to the study treatment. Oncologic disease 
affecting the subject's spouse, palliative treatment, and spouse’s death were listed as contributory 
factors.  
Overall, suicidal ideation and behavior (SMQ) was reported in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and none in the Any secukinumab Q4W group in the entire study period.  
No new malignant or unspecified tumor (SMQ) related event was reported since the PEA data cut-off date 
(01-Oct-2021). Overall, malignant, or unspecified tumors (SMQ) was reported in 1 (0.4%) subject in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W group and none in the Any secukinumab Q4W group in the entire study period. 
No events related to the risks of neutropenia, major cardiovascular events, Crohn’s disease, hepatitis B 
reactivation, immunogenicity, or interaction with live vaccines were reported during the entire study 
period. 
The Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) of AESIs were comparable between the secukinumab dose 
groups (Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W), except for Infections and infestations (SOC) 
for which the EAIR was higher in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (98.1 per 100 SY) compared to the 
Any secukinumab Q4W group (83.2 per 100 SY). 
Study M2302  
The incidence of AEs within the Infections and infestations (SOC) during the entire study period was 
similar between the secukinumab treatment groups (52.1% in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 51.5% in 
the Any secukinumab Q4W). Overall, most Infections and infestations (SOC) that occurred during the 
entire study period were non-serious and mild to moderate severity and recovered without the need for 
treatment discontinuation. 
The most commonly reported infection-related AEs grouped under the Infections and infestations SOCs 
was upper respiratory tract infections (HLT) with similar incidence between the secukinumab treatment 
groups (23.0% in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 20.7% in the Any secukinumab Q4W) and mainly 
(incidence ≥ 5%) consisted of the PTs nasopharyngitis (10.7% in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 9.4% in 
the Any secukinumab Q4W group), upper respiratory tract infection (6.1% in the Any secukinumab Q2W 
and 4.1% in the Any secukinumab Q4W group). 
Hypersensitivity (SMQ, narrow) was reported in 10.7% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
and 8.6% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. Eczema was the most frequently reported PT: 
4.2% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 2.6% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W, 
followed by dermatitis: 1.5% of subjects in both Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W and 
dermatitis contact: 1.9% of subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 1.1% of subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group. Most hypersensitivity cases were either of mild to moderate severity, resolved 
with treatment, did not lead to study treatment discontinuation, and were considered not related to study 
treatment. No AEs of anaphylaxis were reported. 
No new events were reported since the Week 16 CSR cut-off date. As reported in Study M2302 Week 16 
PEA], 1 (0.4%) subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group reported suicidal ideation and intentional 
overdose (PTs) on Day 108 compared to none in the Any secukinumab Q2W group. Overall, suicidal 
ideation and behavior (SMQ) was reported in 1 subject (0.4%) in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and 
Assessment report

none in the Any secukinumab Q4W group in the Entire Study Period. 
No new malignant or unspecified tumors (SMQ) related event was reported since the cut-off date for the 
primary efficacy analysis. Overall, malignant, or unspecified tumors (SMQ) were reported in 1 (0.4%) 
subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and 2 (0.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group in 
the entire study period. No new events were reported since the Week 16 CSR cut-off date. 
As reported in the Week 16 CSR, major adverse cardiovascular events (Novartis MedDRA Query) were 
reported in 2 (0.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group compared to none in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group. Both events (myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage) were fatal, in 
subjects with pre-existing related conditions, and were not suspected to be related to study drug.  
No events related to the risks of hepatitis B reactivation or immunogenicity were reported during the 
entire study period. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AESIs 
The Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs were generally comparable between the secukinumab dose 
regimens (Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W) for any Level 1 term. 
Pooled data - Safety risks and topics of interest 
Infections 
AEs in the Infections and infestations (SOC) during the Entire Treatment Period occurred at similar rates 
in the Any secukinumab groups (52.4% in Q2W and 49.5% in Q4W). Overall, most infections were non-
serious and mild to moderate in severity.  
Overall, nine subjects reported AEs of infection leading to discontinuation (AEDs), two of which occurred 
in Treatment Period 1, and seven during the Entire study period. The two subjects (one on secukinumab 
Q2W and one on placebo) who discontinued during Treatment period 1 are described below: 
- 
- 
the subject in the secukinumab Q2W group discontinued study treatment due to sinusitis 
(moderate, non-serious, not suspected to be related to study treatment), 
the subject in the placebo group discontinued the study treatment due to upper 
respiratory tract infection (moderate non-serious, suspected to be related to study 
treatment). 
Seven subjects (4 in the Any secukinumab Q2W and 3 in the Any secukinumab Q4W groups) discontinued 
due to AEs during the entire study period, details of which are provided below: 
1. 
AEDs in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (4 AEDs in 4 subjects): 
• 
Ear infection (non-serious, moderate, not suspected to be related to study treatment), 
•  Sweat gland infection (serious event of (worsening) of hidradenitis, severe, suspected to 
be related to study treatment), 
• 
Large intestine infection (serious, severe, suspected to be related to study treatment), 
•  Skin candida infection (serious, severe, suspected to be related to study treatment). 
2. 
AEDs in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (4 AEDs in 3 subjects): 
•  Scrotal infection (serious, severe, not suspected to be related to study treatment), 
•  Vulvovaginal candidiasis (non-serious, severe, suspected to be related to study 
treatment), 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 128/158 
 
 
 
 
•  Otitis externa fungal (non-serious, severe, suspected to be related to study treatment), 
and 
• 
Impetigo (non-serious, severe, suspected to be related to the study treatment). 
Overall, during the Entire Study Period, there were 17 events by PTs, which were considered serious and 
occurred in more than one subject in the Any secukinumab group, of which 6 occurred in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and 11 in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. The events by PT reported in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W group were sweat gland infection (2 subjects, 0.4%), cellulitis, appendicitis, 
COVID-19 and urinary tract infection (1 subject each, 0.2%). The events reported in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group were sweat gland infection (4 subjects, 0.9%), cellulitis and pneumonia (2 
subjects each, 0.4%), appendicitis, urinary tract infection, and COVID-19 infection (1 subject each, 
0.2%).  
Similar to what was described for Treatment Period 1, the more frequently reported infections during the 
Entire Treatment Period included (described by descending frequency).  
• 
Infections of skin structures (NMQ), with comparable rates within the two secukinumab groups 
(29.8% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 28.0% in Any secukinumab Q4W) and mainly driven by the 
events of (worsening of) hidradenitis (11.2% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 11.4% in Any 
secukinumab Q4W). Of these, 13 cases were considered serious (1.7% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 
0.8% in Any secukinumab Q4W). 
•  Upper respiratory tract infections (by HLT), with higher incidence in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
(24.1%) compared to Any secukinumab Q4W (21.2%), and mainly driven by nasopharyngitis (PT). 
•  Fungal infectious disorders (by HLGT), higher in the Any secukinumab Q2W (12.0%) compared to 
the Any secukinumab Q4W group (8.3%), which in part may be due to the more severe disease 
population enrolled in the secukinumab Q2W group and consistent with the inhibition of the IL-17 
pathway by secukinumab. Most events in the HS studies corresponded  to  diverse  forms  of  non-
invasive  mucocutaneous  candidiasis  or dermatophytosis. Analysis of ‘Candida infections’ (by HLT) 
showed comparable rates across groups (5.5% in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and 4.1% in Any 
secukinumab Q4W) and mainly consisted of vulvovaginal, oral, and skin candidiasis. Of note, an AE 
of oesophageal candidiasis was reported in one subject (0.2%) in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. 
The event was transient (8 days), mild in severity, resolved with treatment with fluconazole and did 
not lead to treatment discontinuation. The majority of fungal infectious events were managed with 
topical anti-fungal agents. Except for two AEs that were considered serious or severe, all other AEs 
were non- serious, non-severe, non-systemic, non-invasive, and did not lead to study treatment 
discontinuation. The two serious or severe AEs (one each in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups) 
that led to discontinuation of study drug are: 
•  one serious case of skin candida (worsening of inguinal candidial intertrigo) in a subject in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W in the Treatment Period 2. The event was considered severe, suspected 
to be related to study treatment and led to discontinuation of the study treatment; 
•  one non-serious case of vulvovaginal candidiasis in a subject randomized to secukinumab 
Q4W in Treatment Period 2. The event was considered severe, suspected to be related to 
study treatment and led to discontinuation of the study treatment. 
One urinary tract candidiasis (candiduria, PT) was reported in a patient in the Any secukinumab Q2W 
group, 33 days after the 28th IMP administration, during an acute kidney injury SAE and was mild, 
transient, not related to study treatment, and resolved. Study treatment was not ongoing at the time of 
the event. 
• 
Infective pneumonia (SMQ, broad) was similar between the secukinumab groups (9.7% in Any 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 129/158 
 
 
 
 
secukinumab Q2W and 10.1% in Any secukinumab Q4W). The broad array of PT events included in 
this SMQ (i.e., COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 test positive, suspected COVID-19 or influenza) likely 
contributed towards the high incidence of Infective pneumonia (SMQ, broad) occurrence. However, 
these do not reflect the number of confirmed pneumonia cases. In both studies, for the Entire Study 
Period, 7 pneumonia (PT) cases were reported (3 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group, of 
which 2 were moderate and 1 was mild; all three were non-serious, and 2 led to study treatment 
interruption; 3 subjects were in the Any secukinumab Q4W group, of which 2 were severe, 2 were 
serious, 2 were suspected to be related to the study treatment, and 1 led to study treatment 
interruption; and 1 subject was in placebo, which was severe, serious, suspected to be related to 
study treatment, and led to study treatment interruption). Of these 7 pneumonia AEs, 2 were 
COVID-19-related pneumonia (1 subject in Any secukinumab Q2W, which was mild, non-serious, not 
suspected to be related to study treatment, and led to study drug interruption; and 1 subject in 
placebo, which was severe, serious, not suspected to be related to study treatment, resulted in 
treatment interruption, and recovered/resolved, with the patient having completed the study and 
moved to the extension study).  
Other events of interest within the Infections and infestations SOC included: 
•  COVID-19: There were 73 suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in the Entire Study 
Period (36 in Any Secukinumab Q2W and 37 in Any Secukinumab Q4W). 
•  Mycobacterial infectious disorders (HLGT) were reported in two subjects (0.4%) in Any secukinumab 
Q2W, one in each study. Both cases were mild and not considered related to treatment. One case of 
confirmed latent TB occurred 17 days after treatment discontinuation; one case of suspected TB did 
not require specific treatment nor change in study treatment. 
All the remaining AEs by HLTs within the ‘Infections and infestations’ SOC had incidence rates <6%, with 
no trends in treatment-emergent adverse events or patterns suggesting predominance of either Any 
secukinumab Q2W or Any secukinumab Q4W. 
Hypersensitivity 
Analysis of Hypersensitivity (by SMQ, narrow) showed comparable incidence rates for both treatment 
groups (12.0% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 10.3% in Any secukinumab Q4W). No cases of anaphylaxis 
were reported in either of the studies. Eczema was the most frequently reported PT, followed by 
dermatitis, contact dermatitis and rash, of which the majority were mild, not related to study treatment, 
not leading to study discontinuation, and were managed with standard therapy. One case of dermatitis 
infected PT which occurred in a subject in Any secukinumab Q4W was considered serious and not related 
to study treatment.  
Malignancies 
Analysis of Malignant or unspecified tumours (by SMQ) reported low and comparable crude incidence 
rates in both secukinumab groups (0.4% in both the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any secukinumab Q4W 
groups).  
A case of breast carcinoma (female, 50-year-old, active smoker: 34 pack-years, smoking duration of 34 
years) was diagnosed during the Entire Study Period in a subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W group on 
Day 316. The study treatment was discontinued due to the event. The event was considered serious and 
not suspected to be related to study treatment. The event was ongoing at the time of the study 
discontinuation.

A case of Lung neoplasm and metastatic NSCLC (male, 55 year-old, active smoker: 35 pack- years, 
smoking duration of 35 years) was diagnosed during the Entire Study Period in a subject from the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group on Day 263; study treatment was discontinued due to the event, which was 
considered serious and not suspected to be related to the study treatment. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (by NMQ) were reported in 2 (0.4%) subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group. Both events (myocardial infarction, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage) were 
fatal, in subjects with pre-existing related conditions and were not suspected to be related to study drug. 
The case of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was included in the MACE category because of the broad 
scope of the NMQ; however, no major cardiovascular event (MI, stroke, cardiovascular death) was 
reported in this case. Full narratives were provided. 
Suicidal ideation and behavior 
Apart from the two cases of Suicide/self-injury (SMQ) reported during Treatment Period 1, one additional 
case was reported in Study M2301 during the Entire Study Period (PT of ‘Suicidal ideation’) in the 
secukinumab Q2W group on study Day 278. The subject had ongoing medical conditions of depression 
and anxiety at the time of study entry. The event was considered serious and led to drug interruption. 
The event was reported as not suspected to be related to the study drug, study treatment was 
reinstituted, the event resolved upon treatment with diazepam, ethyl loflazepate, venlafaxine, and 
trazodone. The patient moved to the optional extension study. 
Other safety topics of interest 
•  Overall, during the Entire Study Period, new onset IBD occurred in three subjects across both studies 
(0.3% of randomized subjects in both studies). These AEs included: ulcerative colitis (in the 
secukinumab Q2W group in Treatment Period 1), IBD (in the secukinumab Q4W group during 
Treatment Period 1), and Crohn’s disease (in the Any secukinumab Q2W group in the Entire Study 
Period). No new cases of IBD were reported after the Week 16 PEA. All three subjects were in Study 
M2302. The subjects were on active treatment at the time of the AEs. 
•  Neutropenia: During the Entire Study Period, cases of neutropenia were rare (42 cases, 4.1%, in the 
Any secukinumab group), mostly grade 1 or 2, and not associated with infections. There were 11 AEs 
of neutropenia (neutropenia (PT) or neutrophil count decreased (PT)) reported (6 in Any 
secukinumab Q2W and 5 in Any secukinumab Q4W), of which 1 was reported since the Week 16 SCS 
was submitted. None were considered serious, and 2 led to study drug interruption. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of safety topics of interest for the Entire Study Period 
To account for the fact that not all groups were observed for an equally long time, exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates (EAIR per 100 subject-years) were also computed for the safety topics of interest derived 
from the RMP. However, treatment comparisons of secukinumab to placebo for the Entire Study Period 
must still be interpreted with caution, given that AE rates may not be constant over time. 
EAIRs of Infections and infestations (by SOC) were 95.4 per 100 subject-years in the Any secukinumab 
Q2W group and 88.6 per 100 subject-years in the t the Any secukinumab Q4W group, and both were 
lower than placebo (127.6 per 100 subject-years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 131/158 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with the observations during Treatment Period 1, Infections of skin structures (NMQ) showed 
lower EAIRs in Any secukinumab compared to placebo (40.9 per 100 subject-years versus 64.6 per 100 
subject-years, respectively), and similar EAIRs were seen between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any 
secukinumab Q4W groups (42.0 per 100 subject-years versus 39.8 per 100 subject-years, respectively). 
Fungal infectious disorders (by HLGT) showed higher EAIR in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (14.8 per 
100 subject-years) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (10.2 per 100 subject-years). As 
mentioned earlier in the document, this may be related to the more severe disease population enrolled in 
the secukinumab Q2W group, as well as the known role of IL-17A in anti-fungal immunity. 
EAIRs for the remaining identified and potential risks and other safety topics of interest did not show 
relevant predominance for either of the secukinumab groups and were comparable to placebo. 
EAIRs per 100 subject-years for SAEs reported for the safety risks were comparable between the 
treatment groups, and no clinically meaningful differences were noted. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Treatment Period 1 
The majority of newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were of 
CTCAE grade 1 or 2. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening 
hematology abnormalities across treatment groups during Treatment Period 1.  
In Treatment Period 1, neutropaenias were rare, mostly single events and transient. The majority were of 
grade 1 and 2. Two grade 3 neutropaenias (one in each study) were observed. One subject in the 
secukinumab Q2W group and one subject in the placebo group, had grade 3 neutropenia 
(<1.0 - 0.5 x 10E9/L). Both subjects had normal baseline values. The subject on placebo experienced 
grade 3 neutropenia at Week 16, this was a single event and the subject's neutrophil count returned to 
normal at a subsequent visit. The subject on secukinumab Q2W with grade 3 neutropenia (single event) 
improved to grade 2 and 1 (and single normal neutrophils count) at the subsequent visits. Both subjects 
completed treatment and study. No grade 4 abnormalities were observed in Treatment Period 1.  
One subject in the secukinumab Q4W group and 1 subject in the placebo group had grade 3 abnormalities 
in hemoglobin (<80 g/L). Subject in secukinumab Q4W group had normal baseline value and subject in 
placebo group had grade 2 hemoglobin values at baseline. The subject in the secukinumab Q4W group 
with grade 3 hemoglobin discontinued study treatment due to an AE of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. No 
grade 4 abnormalities were observed. 
No meaningful differences in change from baseline in hematological parameters between the 
secukinumab treatment groups and the placebo group were observed during Treatment Period 1 except 
for hemoglobin (1.8 g/L for secukinumab Q2W and 1.3 g/L for secukinumab Q4W versus -0.6 g/L for 
placebo) and platelet (-13.889×109/L for secukinumab Q2W and -13.006×109/L for secukinumab Q4W 
versus 7.003×109/L for placebo) at the Week 16 visit. 
Hematology in Treatment Period 1 for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection 
All newly occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 
for COVID-19 subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or 
worsening hematology abnormalities across treatment groups during Treatment Period 1 for COVID-19 
subjects.

Entire Study Period  
Interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
Similar to the data results in Treatment Period 1, most of the hematological abnormalities reported for 
the Entire Study Period were grade 1 or 2. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening hematology abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period. 
Apart from the grade 3 abnormalities reported in Treatment Period 1, one additional subject in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group had grade 3 anemia at two visits in the Entire Study Period. The subject in the 
Any secukinumab Q2W group had a grade 1 value at baseline and low hemoglobin values throughout the 
study and discontinued treatment and the study due to lack of efficacy. 
In the Entire Study Period, neutropaenias were rare, mostly grade 1 and 2. Apart from the grade 3 
abnormalities reported in Treatment Period 1, one additional subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W group 
had grade 3 neutropenia and two subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group had grade 4 
neutropaenias. The subject with grade 3 neutropenia had a normal absolute neutrophil count at baseline 
and the result of grade 3 neutropenia was an isolated event, the subject's neutrophil count values 
returned to normal at the subsequent visit. For subjects with grade 4 neutropenia, these had been single 
events, the subjects had a normal absolute neutrophil count at baseline and normal values at subsequent 
visits. All subjects completed treatment and study. 
There was no difference between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups in change from baseline for 
any of the hematology parameters except for platelets (-9.407 versus -3.774×109/L) during the Week 52 
visit. 
Hematology in Entire Study Period for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection  
All newly occurring or worsening hematology abnormalities in the Entire Study Period were CTCAE grade 
1 or 2 for COVID-19 subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or 
worsening hematology abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period for COVID-
19 subjects.  
Full 52-week safety dataset 
Study M2301 
One new grade 3 abnormality was observed for hematology since the primary endpoint analysis cut-off 
date (01-Oct-2021). This concerned one subject in the secukinumab Q4W group who had a grade 3 
decrease in hemoglobin. This subject entered the study with low hemoglobin value at baseline which 
remained low (grade 1). At the Week 44 visit, an AE of hemoglobin decreased was noted (grade 3). The 
AE was not resolved at the time of discontinuation and was not suspected to be related to study 
treatment. 
One new grade 3 abnormality was observed for clinical chemistry since the primary endpoint analysis cut-
off date (01-Oct-2021). This concerned one subject in the secukinumab Q2W group who experienced 
a grade 3 increase in ALT. This subject entered the study with an increased ALT value at baseline 
(grade 1). The patient’s medical history included severe obesity (BMI: 41) and hyperuricemia. At the 
Week 52 visit, an AE of liver function test increased was noted (ALT: grade 3; AST: grade 2; bilirubin: 
grade 1). All other liver function parameters were normal. The subject completed the study treatment 
and entered the extension study. At the time of study completion, the AE was resolving and was not 
suspected to be related to study treatment. No subject had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law 
laboratory criteria in the entire study period. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening hematology or clinical 
chemistry including liver function abnormalities across treatment groups during the entire study period. 
Assessment report

Most of these abnormalities were of grade 1 or grade 2. 
Study M2302 
No new grade ≥3 hematological or clinical chemistry or liver function abnormalities were reported since 
last cut-off date (23-Sep-2021) for the primary endpoint analysis. No subject had abnormalities that met 
the Hy’s law laboratory criteria in the entire study period. There were no clinically meaningful differences 
in the newly occurring or worsening hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory measurements, including 
liver function abnormalities across treatment groups, during the entire study period. Most of these 
abnormalities were of grade 1 or grade 2. 
Pooled data  
During Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study Period, the majority of newly occurring or worsening 
laboratory abnormalities were of CTCAE grade 1 or 2; grade 3 and grade 4 abnormalities occurred in ≤ 2 
subjects in any of the secukinumab groups. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening hematology abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period. 
There was a total of 4 grade 3 laboratory abnormalities of decreased hemoglobin count reported in both 
M2301 and M2302 studies (3 in the Any secukinumab group and 1 in the placebo treatment group). Of 
these, 2 were reported in Treatment period 1 (1 in secukinumab Q4W and 1 in placebo) and 2 in the 
Entire Study period (1 in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1 in Any secukinumab Q4W). The new grade 3 
abnormality reported since the Week 16 SCS cut-off is described below: 
    -  One subject with grade 3 hemoglobin decrease in the secukinumab Q4W group in study M2301 (at 
three visits in the Entire Study Period) had a grade 1 value at baseline and low hemoglobin values 
throughout the study. Due to the progressive lowering of hemoglobin values, the subject underwent 
gastroscopy and colonoscopy procedures, which revealed abnormal findings (details not available) the 
subject was administered one dose of intravenous iron preparation. The last available value (72 g/L) was 
measured at Week 60 (safety follow up visit), and the subject completed the study treatment. 
In the Entire Study Period in both Studies M2301 and M2302, laboratory abnormalities of low neutrophil 
count were rare (n = 42, 4.0%), mostly grade 1 or 2. There were 3 subjects with grade 3 decrease in 
neutrophil count (2 in secukinumab Q2W and 1 in placebo), of which two were noted in Treatment Period 
1 (1 on Secukinumab Q2W and 1 on placebo). Two subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group had 
grade 4 neutropenia. No new grade 3 or grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities were reported since the SCS 
cut-off. In both Studies M2301 and M2302, there was no clinically relevant change from baseline in 
hematological parameters up to Week 52 in either secukinumab treatment group. 
Clinical chemistry 
Treatment Period 1 
Most of the newly occurring or worsening chemistry laboratory abnormalities during Treatment Period 1 
were CTCAE grade 1 or 2. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or 
worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities across treatment groups during Treatment Period 1. One 
subject in the secukinumab Q2W group had grade 3 ALT and one subject each in the secukinumab Q2W 
and secukinumab Q4W groups had grade 3 AST. Two subjects in secukinumab Q4W and 1 subject in 
placebo had grade 3 GGT abnormalities. The subject in the secukinumab Q2W group (in Study M2301) 
had grade 3 ALT and AST at a single visit and the results returned to normal at the subsequent visit. The 
subject was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-off. The subject in the secukinumab Q4W 
group (in Study M2302) with grade 3 AST had normal baseline results and the AST result returned to 
normal at the subsequent visit. The subject discontinued treatment in Treatment Period 2 due to lack of

efficacy. For both subjects with grade 3 GGT abnormalities in the secukinumab Q4W (one in each study), 
these were isolated events and the GGT values returned to normal or improved at the subsequent visits. 
One subject completed the study and moved to the extension study while the second subject 
discontinued treatment due to an AE of suicidal ideation. The subject in the placebo group with grade 3 
GGT abnormalities had high GGT values at all visits (including baseline). The subject completed the study 
and moved to the extension study. There were no grade 4 abnormalities.  
There was no meaningful difference between the secukinumab groups and placebo in change from 
baseline up to Week 16 for any of the chemistry parameters except for ALP (-3.0 for secukinumab Q2W 
and -3.1 for secukinumab Q4W versus 0.2 U/L for placebo) and GGT (-2.4 for secukinumab Q2W and -2.2 
for secukinumab Q4W versus 1.2 U/L for placebo). 
Clinical  chemistry  in  Treatment  Period  1  for  subjects  with  confirmed  or  suspected  COVID-19 
infection  
All newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were CTCAE 
grade 1 or 2 for COVID-19 subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities across treatment groups during Treatment Period 
1 for COVID-19 subjects. 
Entire Study Period 
Interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
Similar to the results in Treatment Period 1, the majority of chemistry abnormalities were grade 1 or 2, 
with a few grade-3 events. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or 
worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period. 
Apart from the grade 3 ALT increase during Treatment Period 1, one additional subject in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and two subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group had a grade 3 increase in 
ALT in the Entire Study Period. The subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (in Study M2302) with 
grade 3 ALT abnormality at Week 20 and Week 28 visits, had high ALT values at all visits (including 
grade 1 values at baseline), the subject was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-off and no 
data for a subsequent visit after Week 28 (from when the last grade 3 ALT abnormality was noted) was 
available. The subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (in Study M2301) had an ongoing hepatobiliary 
disorder, the ALT results were high for the majority of visits however, the grade 3 ALT abnormality was 
observed at a single visit only. The patient completed the treatment and the study. The subject in the 
Any secukinumab Q4W group (in Study M2302) was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-off 
and no data for a subsequent visit (from when grade 3 ALT abnormality was noted) was available. Apart 
from the two subjects with grade 3 AST increases (one in each of the secukinumab groups) during 
Treatment Period 1, two subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and one subject in Any secukinumab Q4W (all 
in Study M2302) had a grade 3 AST abnormality during the Entire Study Period. Both subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group switched treatment from placebo in Treatment Period 2, grade 3 AST 
abnormality was an isolated event and the AST results either returned to normal or improved at the 
subsequent visit. Both subjects were ongoing in the study at the time of data cut-off. The subject in the 
Any secukinumab Q4W group was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-off and no data for a 
subsequent visit (from when grade 3 AST abnormality was noted) was available. In the Entire Study 
Period, apart from the grade 3 GGT increases during Treatment Period 1, one subject each in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and in the Any secukinumab Q4W group had a grade 3 GGT increase. For both 
subjects the grade 3 abnormality was an isolated event, one subject completed the treatment and the 
study, and one subject completed the treatment but discontinued the study due to Physician decision 
(due to COVID-19). One subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group (in Study M2301) with an active 
condition of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis at baseline had grade 4 GGT abnormality. The subject's GGT

values were high throughout the study (with a reported AE of worsening of NASH) with a baseline grade 2 
GGT. The grade 4 abnormality was an isolated event that occurred at the Week 52 visit after which the 
subject completed the study treatment and moved to the extension study. 
There was no meaningful difference between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups in change from 
baseline up to Week 52 for any of the chemistry parameters except for GGT (0.3 versus 1.8 U/L). 
Full 52-week safety dataset 
Study M2301 
One new grade 3 abnormality was observed for clinical chemistry since the primary endpoint analysis cut-
off date (01-Oct-2021). This concerned one subject in the secukinumab Q2W group who experienced 
a grade 3 increase in ALT. This subject entered the study with an increased ALT value at baseline 
(grade 1). The patient’s medical history included severe obesity (BMI: 41) and hyperuricemia. At the 
Week 52 visit, an AE of liver function test increased was noted (ALT: grade 3; AST: grade 2; bilirubin: 
grade 1). All other liver function parameters were normal. The subject completed the study treatment 
and entered the extension study. At the time of study completion, the AE was resolving and was not 
suspected to be related to study treatment. No subject had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law 
laboratory criteria in the Entire Study Period. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry 
including liver function abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period. Most of 
these abnormalities were of grade 1 or grade 2. 
Study M2302 
No new grade ≥3 clinical chemistry or liver function abnormalities were reported since last cut-off date 
(23-Sep-2021) for the primary endpoint analysis. No subject had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law 
laboratory criteria in the Entire Study Period. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory measurements, including liver function 
abnormalities across treatment groups, during the Entire Study Period. Most of these abnormalities were 
of grade 1 or grade 2. 
Clinical chemistry in the Entire Study Period for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 
infection  
All newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were CTCAE 
grade 1 or 2 for COVID-19 subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study 
Period for COVID-19 subjects. 
Pooled data 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry 
abnormalities across treatment groups during Treatment Period 1 or in the Entire Study period. Most of 
the newly occurring or worsening chemistry laboratory abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 and in the 
Entire Study Period were CTCAE grades 1 or 2. Grade 3 elevations were few and occurred in ≤3 subjects 
in any of the secukinumab treatment groups (Q2W or Q4W). There was one grade 4 elevation in GGT in a 
subject in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. 
A total of 5 grade 3 laboratory ALT elevations were reported in both M2301 and M2302 studies in the 
Entire Study Period (3 in Any secukinumab Q2W and 2 in Any secukinumab Q4W). Of these, 1 was 
reported in Treatment period 1 (in secukinumab Q2W). The new grade 3 abnormality reported since the 
Week 16 SCS cut-off is described below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 136/158 
 
 
 
 
-  One subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W group in M2301 with grade 3 ALT abnormality at Week 52 
had increased ALT values at all visits (including grade 1 values at baseline). An AE of Liver function test 
(PT) increased was reported on the same day (moderate, non-serious, not suspected to be related to 
study treatment). The subject completed the study and moved to the extension study. 
No ALT grade 4 abnormalities were reported.  
A total of 5 grade 3 laboratory AST elevations were reported in both M2301 and M2302 studies in the 
Entire Study period (3 in Any secukinumab Q2W and 2 in Any secukinumab Q4W). Of these, 2 were 
reported in Treatment period 1 (one in each of the secukinumab groups). No new grade 3 abnormalities 
were reported since the Week 16 SCS cut-off. No AST grade 4 abnormalities were reported. 
A total of 5 grade 3 laboratory GGT elevations were reported in both M2301 and M2302 studies in the 
Entire Study Period (1 in Any secukinumab Q2W, 4 in Any secukinumab Q4W). Of these, 3 were reported 
in Treatment period 1 (2 in secukinumab Q4W and 1 in placebo). As reported in the SCS, one subject had 
a grade 4 GGT abnormality at the Week 52 visit, after which the subject completed the study treatment 
and moved to the extension study, the subject had a grade 2 value at baseline and high GGT values 
throughout the study. No new grade 3 or grade 4 GGT abnormalities were reported since the SCS cut-off. 
The incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities during Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study Period was 
low and generally comparable between the treatment groups. No clinically meaningful changes in liver 
enzymes were observed. No subjects had abnormalities that met the Hy’s law laboratory criteria. Isolated 
cases of ALT or AST or other liver enzymes with meaningful increases (e.g., ≥3x ULN) occurred. 
Clinical chemistry in the Entire Study Period for subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 
infection  
All newly occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were CTCAE 
grade 1 or 2 for COVID-19 subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the newly 
occurring or worsening clinical chemistry abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study 
Period for COVID-19 subjects. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
No pooled analyses for vital signs were performed, but the individual study results were provided. The 
incidence of vital sign abnormalities was low, and no clinically meaningful difference was observed 
between the treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
According to the MAH, safety analyses were not conducted for any particular special patient population. 
Subgroups of study population 
AEs and SAEs (including key risk AEs) were evaluated for Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study Period 
according to the following subgroups based on demography (age, gender, race), baseline characteristics 
(disease duration, body weight), current antibiotic use, geographical region, previous exposure to 
biologics and smoking status.  
Of note, individual events in some of these subgroups were reported in small numbers. Therefore, caution 
should be applied when attempting to draw meaningful conclusions on differences in event incidence by 
treatment regimen among these subgroups.

Analysis of adverse effect exposure-response information 
Overall, the safety profiles for the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W group and the secukinumab 300 mg 
Q4W group were comparable. The overall incidence rate of AEs was higher in Any secukinumab Q4W 
compared to Any secukinumab Q2W (266.4 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q2W, 306.0 per 
100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q4W), which does not suggest a dose relationship overall. AEs in 
the Infections and infestations SOC occurred at a slightly higher incidence in the Any secukinumab 
Q2W group (92.5 per 100 subject-years) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (84.1 per 
100-subject-years). 
Data from previous studies and past submissions also support the assertion that differences in loading or 
dosing regimens do not impact the safety profile of secukinumab. At the time of study initiation, the 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W regimen had been tested in approximately 120 subjects for at least 24 weeks 
in completed clinical studies in uveitis and PsO. Recently available results from additional 196 subjects on 
the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W regimen in Study A2324, conducted in adults with moderate to severe 
plaque PsO with a body weight ≥90 kg who were treated with secukinumab Q4W vs. secukinumab 
Q2W dosing regimens showed that the safety profile of secukinumab 300 mg Q2W was similar to that of 
secukinumab 300 mg Q4W. The safety profile of secukinumab 300 mg Q2W was observed to be in-line 
with that of secukinumab 300 mg Q4W.  
The pooled HS data reveal no new safety concerns specific to the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W and 
Q4W regimens. 
To further evaluate the safety of the secukinumab dose regimens in subjects with HS, exposure-response 
safety analyses were conducted for the pooled database of Studies M2301 and M2302 on subjects 
randomized to secukinumab Q2W or Q4W (n=721). These analyses focused on two types of AEs: 
Infections and infestations (SOC) and Candida infections (HLT).  
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 138/158 
 
 
 
 
The incidence rate of AEs at 1 year was summarized by the range of average secukinumab concentrations 
at steady state and showed that there were no differences in the incidence rates of Infections and 
infestations (SOC) or Candida infections (HLT) across the secukinumab concentration groups. Logistic 
regression analysis indicated that the predicted incidence rates of these events were generally stable with 
increasing secukinumab concentration. 
Immunogenicity and immunological events 
An electrochemiluminescence-based method was used for the detection of potential anti secukinumab 
antibody formation. Blood samples for determination of anti-drug-antibodies (ADA) were taken pre-dose 
at the scheduled time points as indicated in protocols of individual Studies M2301 and M2302. Treatment-
emergent anti-drug-antibodies (TE-ADA) are defined as ADA that developed post-treatment in subjects 
with negative ADA screens at baseline (i.e., seroconversion to ADA positivity from a seronegative state). 
There was a TE-ADA incidence of <1% in the HS patient population who started treatment at the 
beginning of the study. In Study M2301, treatment-emergent ADAs were reported in 1 subject in the 
secukinumab Q4W group during the follow-up period (Week 60). In Study M2302, treatment-emergent 
ADAs were reported in 2 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W group (1 subject at Week 16 and 1 subject 
during the follow-up period). Treatment-emergent ADAs in these subjects were not associated with loss 
of efficacy or AEs related to immunogenicity. In Study M2302, PK behavior was normal in the 2 subjects 
with treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Non-treatment-emergent ADA were also observed in both studies. In Study M2301, 4.6% and 2.9% of 
secukinumab naïve subjects were ADA positive at baseline only in the Q2W and Q4W arms, respectively. 
In Study M2302, 2.9% and 2.3% of secukinumab naïve subjects were ADA positive at baseline only in the 
Q2W and Q4W arms, respectively. Non-treatment related, naturally occurring ADA may lead to a 
confirmed positive response in this assay in either pre-dose samples or samples derived from patients not 
treated with secukinumab. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information regarding drug interactions was generated in Study M2301 and Study M2302. 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab.  
Subjects receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In the 
vaccine Study CAIN457A2224, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations were 
administered to healthy volunteers, a similar proportion of subjects treated with secukinumab, and 
subjects treated with placebo were able to mount an adequate immune response of at least a 4-fold 
increase in antibody titers to meningococcal and influenza antigens. The data suggest that secukinumab 
does not suppress the humoral immune response to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment Period 1  
The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low and comparable in both 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (1.7% and 1.4%), and the placebo group (1.4%). None of the AEs 
that led to study treatment discontinuation were reported in >1 subject (by PT) in any treatment group. 
In total, 11 subjects in the Any secukinumab group (6 subjects in the secukinumab Q2W group and 5 
subjects in the secukinumab Q4W group) discontinued study treatment due to the following AEs: 
arthralgia, ulcerative colitis, IBD, dermatitis, amyloidosis, PsO, rheumatoid arthritis, sinusitis, vulval 
cancer, suicidal attempt, and suicidal ideation (each reported in 1 subject). Of these, the AEs of ulcerative 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

colitis, IBD, suicide attempt and amyloidosis were considered serious. In the placebo group, 5 subjects 
reported AEs of upper respiratory tract infection, hematuria, hidradenitis, human chorionic gonadotropin 
increased and pruritus (each reported in 1 subject) that led to study treatment discontinuation. None of 
these AEs were considered serious. 
Entire Study Period  
Interim (approx. 60%) safety dataset 
The incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation (Table 40) was low and comparable in the 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (4.7% vs. 4.2%), the Any secukinumab Q2W vs. Q4W groups (4.0% 
vs. 3.4%) and the placebo group (3.7%). Two AEs caused discontinuation in >1 subject in total: 
(worsening of) hidradenitis in 3 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group and 2 subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group, and abdominal pain in 1 subject each in the Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W 
groups. The events of (worsening of) hidradenitis and abdominal pain were serious. AEs of (worsening of) 
hidradenitis were mostly events of worsening of study indication or flares of HS. All other PTs were 
isolated events with each reported in no more than 1 subject. In total, 21 subjects in the Any 
secukinumab Q2W group and 18 subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group discontinued study 
treatment due to AEs.

In the entire study period, the incidence of AEs causing discontinuation was comparable between the Any 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. 
Study M2301 
No additional subjects who discontinued study treatment due to AEs were reported since the Week 16 
PEA cut-off date (01-Oct-2021). 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and similar in both Any secukinumab 
Q2W and Q4W groups. In total, 11 subjects (4.1%) in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued 
study treatment due to AEs compared to 7 subjects (2.6%) in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. All these 
events were isolated incidences, and each of them were reported in no more than 1 subject. At the final 
DBL, in 3 subjects (1 each in the secukinumab Q2W (PT: hidradenitis), secukinumab Q4W 
(PT: hidradenitis), and placebo-Q2W (PT: hematemesis) groups) the action taken with study treatment 
due to AE was updated compared to the Week 16 PEA from “drug withdrawn” to “dose not changed”. 
At time of the final DBL, the action taken with the study treatment due to AE (ear infection) was updated 
from “drug interrupted” to “drug withdrawn” in 1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group, and one 
additional AE (PT: impetigo) leading to discontinuation was reported for a subject in the placebo-Q4W

group who had already reported treatment discontinuation due to an AE of fungal external otitis (i.e., 
subject discontinued treatment due to these two AEs). 
Study M2302 
At the time of the final DBL, no additional subjects who discontinued study treatment due to AEs were 
reported since the Week 16 PEA cut-off date (23-Sep-2021). 
As reported in the Week 16 CSR, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and similar in 
both the Any secukinumab Q2W and the Any secukinumab Q4W groups. At Week 52 final analysis, 
nine (3.4%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q2W group discontinued study treatment due to AEs 
compared to 10 (3.8%) subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group. All these events were isolated 
incidences, each reported in only one subject, and the majority of them were not suspected to be related 
to study treatment. 
Post marketing experience 
Secukinumab is currently not approved for moderate to severe HS.  
Post-marketing data for the other approved indications are provided in AIN457 PSUR 26-Dec-2019 to 
25-Dec-2020. The cumulative post-marketing subject exposure since the International Birth Date (IBD, 
26-Dec-2014) of secukinumab is estimated to be approximately 680,470 subject-treatment years. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data in support of the extension of indication of secukinumab to moderate to severe HS 
derive from the two randomized, double-blind, multicenter pivotal phase 3 studies of identical design, 
study M2301 and study M2302, assessing two subcutaneous secukinumab dose regimens (300 mg Q2W 
or Q4W). Pooled data are presented to assess short-term (16 weeks - Treatment Period 1) and long-term 
safety (52 weeks - Entire Study Period) up to the data cut-off dates (01-Oct-2021 for Study M2301 and 
23-Sep-2021 for Study M2302). In the initial submission, pooled safety data were available for at least 16 
weeks of treatment for all subjects and the long-term data up to 52 weeks for approximately 60 %. 
Subsequently, the full 52-week safety dataset was submitted for assessment. However, these data were 
made available only separately for each pivotal study. Therefore, pooled data were subsequently, on 
request, provided. 
For both dosing regimens, secukinumab 300 mg was administered at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 as loading 
injections, followed by maintenance injections on a Q2W or Q4W basis, up to Week 52 as per protocol 
schedule.  
As the Q2W administration of secukinumab 300 mg has recently been approved for use in PsO patients in 
the EU, a comparison to available safety data from Study A2324 was performed. 
In addition, the MAH refers also to the existing secukinumab safety database across all other indications, 
with a cumulative exposure of 34,907.50 subject-years from 20,961 subjects and healthy volunteers in 
clinical studies, and 680,470 subject-years of post-marketing exposure to secukinumab (AIN457 PSUR 
26-Dec-2019 to 25-Dec-2020).  
Furthermore, an extension study M2301E1 is currently ongoing; the CHMP recommends the MAH to 
submit these results for assessment once they become available. 
Patient exposure  
Treatment period 1 (16 weeks) 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023

Exposure to study treatment was summarized for the pooled data from both of the phase 3 studies 
PEP analysis. In total, 721 subjects received secukinumab in the placebo-controlled Treatment Period 1 
(361 subjects in secukinumab Q2W and 360 subjects in secukinumab Q4W) and 363 subjects received 
placebo. 
Overall, 93.6% of the randomized subjects completed Week 16 of the studies.  
Pooled long-term data from the two pivotal studies  
In total, 1060 adult subjects with moderate to severe HS received secukinumab during the Entire Study 
Period (527 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 533 subjects in Any secukinumab Q4W). 
At Week 16, subjects who were initially randomized to either of the two secukinumab regimens continued 
on  the  same  dose  regimen,  and  subjects  initially  randomized  to  Placebo  were randomized to 
either secukinumab Q2W or Q4W, following a blinded loading dose regimen. Therefore, both the 'Any 
secukinumab Q2W' and 'Any secukinumab Q4W' groups also included placebo-switchers  assigned  to 
these  regimens,  and  the  treatment  group  'Any  secukinumab' included all subjects who took at least 
one dose of secukinumab. 
In  the  Entire  Study  Period,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  was  364.0  days  for  the  Any 
secukinumab treatment group, with a cumulative exposure of 907.0 subject-years. For subjects who 
switched from placebo to secukinumab at Week 16, exposure only after the first dose of secukinumab is 
counted. 
Cumulative exposure (subject-years) was similar between the secukinumab Q2W (340.2) and Q4W 
(336.5) groups and similar between the Any secukinumab Q2W group (454.0) and Any secukinumab 
Q4W group (453.0). 
Although disease history and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the treatment 
groups, the secukinumab Q2W group comprised a more severe population (more subjects with Hurley 
stage III, higher lesion count, older age, more smokers, and more subjects rated ‘very severe’ on the HS-
PGA) compared to the secukinumab Q4W and placebo groups. Despite these differences between 
treatment groups, the demographics of the overall population were, according to the MAH, consistent 
with the population of subjects who completed the Week 52 visit up to the data cut-off date for each 
study.  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
A direct safety comparison between secukinumab and placebo can be evaluated up to 16 weeks of the 
Treatment Period 1. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the secukinumab treatment groups 
(65.1% and 64.4% in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, respectively) and the placebo group 
(65.0%). No meaningful differences in AE frequency or clinical relevance were reported between the 
secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. AEs were mostly non-serious (approximately 98%), mild to 
moderate in severity (approximately 97%), and did not require drug discontinuation (approximately 
99%).  
The AEs with the highest frequency were reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations, with similar 
incidences across the secukinumab groups (30.7% vs. 30.6% in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, 
respectively) and placebo group (31.7%), with the most commonly reported AEs being headache 
(10.4%), nasopharyngitis (8.0%) and (worsening of) hidradenitis (5.1%).  
Initial interim (60%) 52-week Entire Study Period (from week 16 onward all patients receiving 
secukinumab), showed, after adjusting for exposure, that overall incidence of AEs was lower in the Any 
secukinumab group than the placebo group (285.2 vs. 412.2 per 100 subject-years). The EAIR rate was 
lower for the secukinumab Q2W group compared to the secukinumab Q4W group (274.3 vs. 
296.7 per 100 subject-years) and for the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the Any 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 142/158 
 
 
 
 
secukinumab Q4W group (266.4 vs. 306.0 per 100 subject-years). Any possible reasons for the apparent 
differences seen, were not readily apparent. However, placebo comparison in the Entire Treatment Period 
is hampered by the different duration of treatment.  
The SOC with the highest EAIR in the Any secukinumab group was Infections and infestations. A higher 
incidence was reported in the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W 
group (92.5 vs. 84.1 per 100 subject-years), with the most reported PT being nasopharyngitis. No 
differences were observed in the EAIRs of other SOCs between the secukinumab dose regimens. 
The most commonly reported (≥10 per 100 subject-years) AEs by PT in the Any secukinumab group were 
headache (20.9 per 100 subject-years), (worsening of) hidradenitis and nasopharyngitis (both 14.8 per 
100 subject-years). On PT level, no meaningful differences in AE frequency or clinical relevance were 
reported between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, with the majority (approximately 98%) of the 
reported AEs being non-serious, mild to moderate in severity (approximately 97%) not requiring drug 
discontinuation (approximately 99%).  
On analysis of the full 52-week safety Entire Study Period dataset, there were no new treatment-
emergent safety signals identified during the long-term exposure of secukinumab, with the safety profile 
over the entire study period being similar to Treatment Period 1. The overall incidence of AEs for both 
treatment groups was 83.9% in study M2301 and 80.8% in study M2302. Subsequently, pooled data 
were provided, on request.  
Consistent with data reported at Week 16, for the Entire Study Period, the overall EAIR for AEs was lower 
in the Any secukinumab Q2W group (274.6 per 100 subject-years) compared to the Any secukinumab 
Q4W group (301.6 per 100 subject-years), with no specific SOCs or PTs driving the difference. ‘Infections 
and infestations’ was the most commonly reported SOC with a higher incidence in the Any secukinumab 
Q2W group (94.0 per 100 subject-years) compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W group (87.9 per 100 
subject-years). Most of the individual events in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ (>96%) were non-
serious, mild (approximately 70%) or moderate (approximately 28%) in severity and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation (only approximately 1% of AEs resulted in permanent treatment withdrawal). 
As was reported at Week 16, the most frequent AEs over the Entire Study Period (>5%) included 
headache, (worsening of) hidradenitis, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infection, 
with similar frequencies between the Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. 
Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions (TEADRs)  
Pooled Phase 3 data of studies conducted in HS and other relevant indications (i.e., psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) to update the current list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for secukinumab did not reveal any new ADRs and support the previously 
established safety profile of secukinumab across the approved indications. A concise tabular presentation 
of the TEADRs (including severity) of the pooled safety data (full 52 week data set) of the two pivotal 
phase 3 studies was, on request, provided by the MAH. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with 
the pooled numbers. In addition the frequency for the adverse reaction tinea pedis has been updated in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC from common to uncommon and details on infections for patients with HS are 
provided. 
Deaths, SAE 
No deaths were reported during Treatment Period 1. The incidence rates of SAEs up to 16 weeks were 
low and comparable for both secukinumab regimens and placebo (2.5% for both secukinumab Q2W and 
secukinumab Q4W versus 3.0% for placebo). No pattern in the type of event was evident. As expected, 
the most common SAEs for secukinumab, observed in both study periods, were in the Infections and 
infestations SOC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 143/158 
 
 
 
 
In the Entire Study Period (full pooled dataset), the two deaths reported were considered unrelated to the 
study drug. The incidence of SAEs was low and comparable for both secukinumab groups (7.6% in Any 
secukinumab Q2W, 7.5% in Any secukinumab Q4W), with no clustering or pattern in the type of events 
reported.  
In the analysis of the full safety dataset several new SAEs were reported. Differences in the numbers of 
SAEs between treatment groups was minimal and all these SAEs were not suspected by the investigator 
to be related to study treatment. No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  EAIRs  of  total  SAEs  were 
observed  across  the treatment groups (9.4 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab and 10.1 per 100 
subject-years in  placebo)  nor  between  the  secukinumab  dose  regimen  groups  (9.1  per  100  subject-
years  in Any secukinumab Q2W and 9.6 per 100 subject-years in Any secukinumab Q4W).  
Discontinuations  
During Treatment Period 1, the incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low, 
single occurrences and comparable in both secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups (1.7% and 1.4%), and 
the placebo group (1.4%). In total, 11 subjects in the Any secukinumab group (6 subjects in the 
secukinumab Q2W group and 5 subjects in the secukinumab Q4W group) discontinued study treatment 
due to the following AEs: arthralgia, ulcerative colitis, IBD, dermatitis, amyloidosis, PsO, rheumatoid 
arthritis, sinusitis, vulval cancer, suicidal attempt, and suicidal ideation (each reported in 1 subject). Of 
these, the AEs of ulcerative colitis, IBD, suicide attempt and amyloidosis were considered serious. In the 
placebo group, 5 subjects reported AEs of upper respiratory tract infection, hematuria, hidradenitis, 
human chorionic gonadotropin increased and pruritus that led to study treatment discontinuation. None of 
these AEs were considered serious. 
In the full 52-week dataset, no additional subjects who discontinued study treatment due to AEs were 
reported since the Week 16. Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low and similar 
in both Any secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. All these events were isolated incidences, and each of 
them were reported in no more than one subject. At the final DBL, the reason for discontinuation was 
reclassification for 3 subjects, but this is considered not to have an impact on the interpretation of these 
data. 
Severity of AEs  
Adverse events during both Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study Period were mostly mild or 
moderate in severity, with no imbalance seen in the severity of AEs between the secukinumab and the 
placebo groups. The proportion of subjects with mild AEs during the Entire Study Period in the 
secukinumab groups were 38.5% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 41.7% in Any secukinumab Q4W, and 
those with moderate AEs were 35.9% in Any secukinumab Q2W and 34.7% in Any secukinumab Q4W 
groups. Severe events were reported with similar incidence in the Any secukinumab Q2W and Any 
secukinumab Q4W groups (7% and 6.9%, respectively). The most frequent severe AEs reported for both 
the secukinumab groups were in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’ (2.7% in Any secukinumab Q2W 
and 2.1% in Any secukinumab Q4W). All severe AEs (PTs) were in ≤3 subjects, with the exceptions of the 
following: worsening of Hidradenitis (4 subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 7 subjects in Any 
secukinumab Q4W) considered not related to study treatment (except in one subject), and not leading to 
study treatment discontinuation. Three cases occurred before starting study treatment; headache (3 
subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1 subject in Any secukinumab Q4W): considered related in one 
case, with all subjects completing the study with no treatment interruption; and sweat gland infection (4 
subjects in Any secukinumab Q2W and 1 subject in Any secukinumab Q4W), considered related in one 
case. All subjects completed the study, with 1 subject interrupting and 1 subject discontinuing the study 
treatment.

Laboratory values  
Overall, no clear safety signals were observed on analysis of the laboratory data. The majority of newly 
occurring or worsening laboratory abnormalities in Treatment Period 1 were of CTCAE grade 1 or 2. There 
were no clinically meaningful differences across treatment groups. One subject in the secukinumab 
Q4W group and one subject in the placebo group had grade 3 abnormalities in haemoglobin (<80 g/L); 
grade 3 decreases in neutrophil count occurred in 2 subjects (one in secukinumab Q2W and one in 
placebo).  
Apart from the grade 3 haemoglobin abnormalities reported in Treatment Period 1, no additional subject 
had grade 3 anaemia in the Entire Study Period. One additional subject in the Any secukinumab Q2W 
group had grade 3 neutropenia and two subjects in the Any secukinumab Q4W group had grade 4 
neutropenia in the Entire Study Period. 
Safety data from the full 52-week dataset revealed one new grade 3 abnormality for hematology and 
one for clinical chemistry since the primary endpoint analysis. Overall, it is agreed that there were no 
clinically meaningful differences in the newly occurring or worsening hematology or clinical chemistry 
including liver function abnormalities across treatment groups during the Entire Study Period assessed on 
the full safety set. Most of these abnormalities were of grade 1 or grade 2. 
Safety topics of interest 
It is agreed with the MAH that, overall, the frequency of AEs categorized as compound and class-related 
risks, and important potential and identified risks was generally similar across treatment groups in both 
Treatment Period 1 and the Entire Study period, except for the SOC Infections and infestations, which 
had a higher EAIR in the Q2W group compared to the Q4W group, however, the EAIR in both treatment 
regimens was lower than in the placebo group. The cases reported for Infections and infestations (SOC) 
were mainly non-serious and manageable. Three subjects discontinued study treatment due to an 
infection: a serious event of worsening of scrotal infection was reported in 1 subject in the Any 
secukinumab Q4W group (severe and not suspected to be related to study treatment), vulvovaginal 
candidiasis in 1 subject in the secukinumab Q4W group (non-serious, severe and suspected to be related 
to study treatment) and large intestinal infection in 1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group (serious 
event of infectious colitis, severe and suspected to be related to study treatment. 
Based on the known safety profile of secukinumab, an increased risk of IBD is known to occur in patients 
with HS. New onset IBD was rare and reported in only 2 subjects during Treatment Period 1. One subject 
in the secukinumab Q2W treatment group discontinued study treatment due to an SAE of ulcerative colitis 
and 1 subject in the secukinumab Q4W group discontinued study treatment due to an SAE of IBD. Both 
cases were considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment.  
Neutropenia was also rare, and mostly grade 1 or 2 events. Grade 3 neutropenia (<1.0 - 0.5 x 10E9/L) 
was reported in 2 subjects (1 subject in the secukinumab Q2W group and 1 subject in the placebo group). 
Both subjects had baseline values within the reference range. The subject on placebo experienced grade 
3 neutropenia at Week 16; this was a single event and the subject's neutrophil count returned to normal 
at a subsequent visit. The subject on secukinumab Q2W with grade 3 neutropenia (single event) 
improved to grade 2 and 1 at the subsequent visits. Both subjects completed treatment and the study. 
There were no grade 4 neutropenia events. 
The incidence of Candida infections (HLT: including PTs of oral candidiasis, skin candida, vulvovaginal 
candidiasis, candida infection and balanitis candida) was low, with a similar incidence reported across all 
treatment groups (1.9% in the secukinumab Q2W group and 1.7% in both the secukinumab Q4W and 
placebo groups). The majority of these cases were non-serious and manageable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 145/158 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of Fungal infectious disorder (HLGT) was slightly higher in the secukinumab Q2W group 
compared to the secukinumab Q4W and placebo groups (5.3% in secukinumab Q2W, 3.9% in 
secukinumab Q4W, 2.8% in placebo). The PTs were all muco-cutaneous events and all cases were non-
serious, manageable with standard therapy and of limited duration, thus the difference did not appear 
clinically significant. Furthermore, all events were mild to moderate and at the time of data cut-off 
approximately 90% of the events that occurred in Treatment Period 1 were considered resolved and none 
led to study treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
The safety data on the AESI from the full 52-week dataset was consistent with the results from the initial 
interim analysis. If differences were seen, they are considered not to have a significant impact on the 
already established safety profile of secukinumab. Pooled pivotal safety data from the Entire Study Period 
were in-line with these data. 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the trials across the approved indications for secukinumab, treatment emergent ADAs 
were rare (<1%) in secukinumab-treated subjects with HS, and were not associated with loss of efficacy, 
PK changes or AEs related to immunogenicity.  
COVID-19 pandemic 
According to the MAH, the COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on the recruitment and the 
timelines of the two HS phase 3 studies. Precautions were taken (Protocol Amendment 01) to mitigate 
potential risk of the COVID-19 pandemic on the study, allowing for flexibility with regards to home 
treatment administration and increasing the study population by 15% to account for missed doses and 
efficacy assessments. There were 13 suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported during 
Treatment Period 1 (6 cases in the secukinumab Q2W group, 3 in the secukinumab Q4W group and 4 in 
the placebo group). The majority of these cases of COVID-19 infection were mild, all cases resolved, and 
none led to study discontinuation. Thus, overall, the impact of the pandemic on the safety results appears 
to have been minimal.  
Long-term data  
The long-term safety profile appeared similar to that previously reported for secukinumab (for both 
treatment regimens), with no new and unexpected findings. The generally favourable risk profile of 
secukinumab in treatment of HS is also supported by substantial experience in the post-marketing setting 
across the already authorised therapeutic indications.  
The long-term extension study of studies M2301 and M2302 (study M2301E1) is noted, and the CHMP 
has recommended the MAH to submit these results for assessment once they become available. These 
data are not considered essential in the context of the current variation application. 
Comparison of safety in psoriasis and HS  
As the Q2W administration of secukinumab 300 mg has recently been approved for use in PsO patients in 
the EU, a comparison to available safety data from study A2324 was performed. Acknowledging the 
limitations of this type of comparisons, the overall safety profile of the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W 
regimen in HS (studies M2301 and M2302) was comparable to that of moderate to severe psoriasis 
(study A2324). However, an overall higher incidence of AEs and overall EAIRs of AEs was observed in HS 
patients. As stated by the MAH this could be related to disease specific aspects (i.e., HS population 
presenting higher inflammatory burden and broad spectrum of associated co-morbidities, open wounds) 
and supported by the higher incidence rates of PTs often reported as associated with HS (i.e., headache, 
worsening of hidradenitis and diarrhoea). The EAIRs of SAEs in subjects treated with secukinumab in the 
Entire Study Period was comparable between the HS and the psoriasis populations.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe HS with secukinumab, evaluated in 
two identical pivotal phase 3 studies (M2301 and M2302) at two different dose regimens (secukinumab 
300 mg Q2W and secukinumab 300 mg Q4W) showed overall a safety profile similar to that previously 
established for secukinumab across various other indications, both short-term (Treatment Period 1, up to 
Week 16) and the longer term (Entire Study Period, up to 52 weeks). The safety results on the full safety 
data set were overall consistent with the results of the placebo controlled Treatment period 1 and the 
initial interim analysis on the subset (approx. 60%). No new or unexpected safety findings were evident.  
The CHMP concluded that the safety profile of secukinumab in treatment of adult patients with moderate 
to severe HS is considered acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Assessment report

Page 149/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  A full user test was carried for the original application of Cosentyx (secukinumab) in the indication 
of plaque psoriasis, and two additional full user tests of the Cosentyx PL were performed during 
the registration of the psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) indications. 
• 
The previously approved Cosentyx PL has now been updated with information related to the new 
proposed indication of moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The changes proposed 
to be included in the Cosentyx PL are minor and limited to the following: 
o 
o 
the indication wording, which is in line with the wording for the compound already 
approved for the HS indication in Europe (Humira/adalimumab), 
the posology wording, which is already approved for the psoriasis indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HS is a painful, chronic, recurrent, and debilitating inflammatory skin condition of the pilosebaceous 
follicle with an underlying immune system imbalance that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. 
HS typically presents with painful, deep, inflammatory lesions, mostly inflammatory nodules, and 
abscesses, which progressively scar and suppurate and lead to malodorous discharge in the apocrine 
gland-bearing parts of the body. Inflammatory lesions are complicated during disease progression by 
sinus tract formation and fistulisation and may lead to hypertrophic scarring with a possible impact on 
function. The most common areas affected are the axillae, the groin and the anogenital region. HS has a 
highly negative impact on QoL and devastating psychological effects, with an impact greater than for 
many other dermatologic diseases. Patients with HS also often suffer from depression, social isolation, 
impaired sexual health, and difficulty performing work duties. The disease starts after puberty, and 
women are more frequently affected than men in a ratio of 3:1. Risk factors include obesity and smoking. 
Although epidemiological prevalence estimates vary widely (0.03% to 4.0%) and geographical differences 
exist, a prevalence of approximately 0.1% to 1% is accepted by the scientific community. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment guidelines recommend a variety of medical treatments that can be used to manage the 
disease, including topical and systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapies, retinoids, systemic 
immunomodulators and biologics. Recurrent combination therapy using multiple antimicrobials represents 
the first step to control the symptoms in patients with HS. However, it is recognised that HS is not an 
infectious disease, but rather a chronic inflammatory condition, with elevated systemic levels of 
inflammatory markers. Therefore, systemic anti-inflammatory agents are a more appropriate therapeutic 
strategy than antibiotics. Once irreversible fibrosis occurs, medical treatment can only control some 
symptoms, while the only option to manage fibrotic lesions is surgery. Currently, adalimumab (Humira), 
an anti-TNF-α antibody, is the only biologic therapy approved for the treatment of adults with moderate 
to severe HS (approval granted in 2015 in the US and EU). Two similarly designed Phase 3 studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 150/158 
 
 
 
 
demonstrated the superiority of weekly adalimumab over placebo with respect to Hidradenitis 
Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at Week 12: 41.8% adalimumab vs. 26.0% placebo in 
PIONEER I, and 58.9% adalimumab vs. 27.6% placebo in PIONEER II. However, considering the very 
limited treatment armamentarium, an unmet need exists for additional systemic therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The variation application is supported by two identical double-blind placebo-controlled studies with 
two secukinumab regimens (identical loading with 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by 
a maintenance regimen of either 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W). The duration of the placebo-controlled 
period was 16 weeks, and it was followed by a 36-week double-blind period for which all subjects on 
placebo until Week 16 were switched to one of the secukinumab regimens. The primary endpoint was 
HiSCR50 response at Week 16; secondary multiplicity-controlled endpoints at Week 16 were abscess and 
nodule (AN) count, occurrence of flares, and NRS30 response for pain. 
Within the initial submission, long-term Week 52 efficacy and safety data were provided for 
approximately 60% of subjects who had completed 52 weeks of treatment at the time of the primary 
endpoint analysis data cut-off dates for the submission. With the responses to the 1st RSI, the MAH 
provided additional analyses based on the full 52-week data and within the response to the 2nd RSI the 
overall pooled safety data for the two pivotal studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both studies, the proportion of subjects with a HiSCR50 response at Week 16 was higher in both 
secukinumab groups compared to placebo, and favourable effects were also consistently seen on the 
secondary endpoints. Some variability was seen between the two studies; notably, in study M2302, 
the Q4W regimen outperformed the Q2W regimen e.g., on HiSCR50. In pooled data, the magnitudes of 
the treatment effects with Q2W and Q4W were overall very similar. 
For HiSCR50 response at Week 16, the results were as follows: 
•  M2301: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 45.0% vs. 33.7%, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.12, 2.73), p=.0070 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 41.8% vs. 33.7%, OR 1.48 (0.95, 2.32), p=.0418 
•  M2302: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 42.3% vs. 31.2%, OR 1.64 (1.05, 2.55), p=.0149 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 46.1% vs. 31.2%, OR 1.90 (1.22, 2.96), p=.0022 
• 
Pooled data: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 43.7% vs. 32.4%, OR 1.69 (1.24, 2.31), p=.0005 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 43.9% vs. 32.4%, OR 1.67 (1.22, 2.29), p=.0007 
For percentage reduction in AN count from baseline to Week 16, the results were as follows: 
•  M2301: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: -46.8 vs. -24.3, LS mean diff (SE) -23.05 (-33.90, -12.21), p <.0001 
o  Q4W vs placebo: -42.4 vs. -24.3, LS mean diff -18.46 (-29.32, -7.60), p=.0004

•  M2302: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: -39.3 vs. -22.4, LS mean diff -16.33 (-28.79, -3.88), p=.0051 
o  Q4W vs placebo: -45.5 vs. -22.4, LS mean diff -22.94 (-35.24, -10.63), p=.0001

o  Q4W vs placebo: -44.0 vs. -23.3, LS mean diff -20.82 (-29.02, -12.62), p<.0001 
For cumulative flare rate at Week 16, the results were as follows: 
•  M2301: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 15.4% vs. 29.0%, OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.25, 0.73), p=.0010 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 23.2% vs. 29.0%, OR 0.71 (0.43, 1.17), p=.0926 
•  M2302: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 20.1% vs. 27.0%, OR 0.68 (0.41, 1.14), p=.0732 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 15.6% vs. 27.0%, OR 0.49 (0.29, 0.84), p=.0049 
• 
Pooled data: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 17.7% vs. 28.0%, OR 0.54 (0.37, 0.77), p=.0005 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 19.4% vs. 28.0%, OR 0.60 (0.42, 0.87), p=.0032 
For  pain  (NRS30  response  among  subjects  with  a  NRS  score  of  3  or  higher,  formally  analysed  only  for 
pooled data), the results were as follows: 
• 
Pooled data: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 36.6% vs. 23.0%, OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.37, 3.16), p=.0003 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 33.5% vs. 23.0%, OR 1.77 (1.15, 2.70), p=.0044 
•  M2301: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 34.1% vs. 23.8%, OR 1.84 (1.00, 3.40) 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 32.2% vs. 23.8%, OR 1.67 (0.89, 3.15) 
•  M2302: 
o  Q2W vs placebo: 38.6% vs. 22.4%, OR 2.29 (1.28, 4.09) 
o  Q4W vs placebo: 34.7% vs. 22.4%, OR 1.86 (1.03, 3.37) 
Based on observed data: 
•  HiSCR50 response rate at Week 52 for the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W dose regimens was 52.3% 
and 47.1% in M2301, and 65.0% and 62.2% in M2302, respectively. 
•  Mean percentage change in AN count from baseline to Week 52 with the secukinumab Q2W and 
Q4W dose  regimens  was  −59.9%  and  −54.9%  in  M2301,  and  −56.3%  and  −61.1%  in  M2302, 
respectively. 
In the pooled data for M2301 and M2302, NRS30 response rates at Week 52 were 55.2% and 53.0% for 
Q2W and Q4W, respectively (NRS30 response was reported for subjects with a baseline NRS score ≥3).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The principal initial concern was related to the MAH’s choice regarding the recommended posology. 
Although the results do not show any consistent benefit of the Q2W regimen over the Q4W regimen, the 
MAH initially proposed that all HS patients be maintained on a Q2W regimen, as opposed to the Q4W 
regimen that is used across all other authorised indications. While the theoretical grounds for HS patients 
potentially requiring slightly higher doses are acknowledged, the benefit of the Q2W maintenance 
regimen over Q4W was considered minimal and unconvincingly demonstrated. Posologies permitting 
escalation based on clinical response are already authorised for the plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, 
and ankylosing spondylitis indications, and although escalation strategies were not directly pursued within 
the current programme, the MAH was requested to justify the benefit of starting with Q2W dosing instead 
of starting with Q4W dosing with the option to titrate to Q2W dosing on the basis of treatment response. 
The MAH agreed to amend the posology accordingly, and the issue is thereby considered resolved. 
Results for Week 52 data are mostly based on observed data, and some inherent biases are thus 
unavoidable. Nevertheless, considering the descriptive nature of the long-term data, it is considered that 
maintenance of effect has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
More long term data will be provided with the ongoing extension study M2301E1. The study evaluates the 
effect of treatment interruption (randomised withdrawal) and re-treatment with secukinumab on efficacy, 
tolerability and safety in subjects with moderate to severe HS who completed either of the two Phase 3 
studies, M2301 or M2302. The CHMP recommends the MAH to submit these results for assessment once 
they become available. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During Treatment Period 1 (up to 16 weeks; placebo control), the overall incidence of AEs was similar 
between the secukinumab treatment groups (65.1% and 64.4% in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W 
groups, respectively) and the placebo group (65.0%). No meaningful differences in AE frequency or 
clinical relevance were reported between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups. AEs were mostly non-
serious (approximately 98%), mild to moderate in severity (approximately 97%), and did not require 
drug discontinuation (approximately 99%).  
The AEs with the highest frequency were reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations, with similar 
incidences across the secukinumab groups (30.7% vs. 30.6% in the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, 
respectively) and placebo group (31.7%), with the most commonly reported AEs being headache 
(10.4%), nasopharyngitis (8.0%) and (worsening of) hidradenitis (5.1%). No deaths were reported. The 
incidence of SAEs was low and comparable for both secukinumab regimens and placebo (2.5% for both 
secukinumab Q2W and secukinumab Q4W versus 3.0% for placebo), with the most commonly reported 
SAEs in the SOC Infections and infestations. No pattern in the type of event was evident. 
During the 52-week Entire Study Period, in analysis of the initial subset (approx. 60%) of patients, (from 
week 16 onward all patient receiving secukinumab), after adjusting for exposure, the overall incidence of 
AEs was lower in the Any secukinumab group than the placebo group (285.2 vs. 412.2 per 100 subject-
years). The EAIR rate was lower for the secukinumab Q2W group compared to the secukinumab Q4W 
group (274.3 vs. 296.7 per 100 subject-years) and for the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the 
Any secukinumab Q4W group (266.4 vs. 306.0 per 100 subject-years). 
The SOC with the highest EAIR in the Any secukinumab group was Infections and infestations. A higher 
incidence was reported in the Any secukinumab Q2W group compared to the Any secukinumab Q4W 
group (92.5 vs. 84.1 per 100 subject-years), with the most reported PT being nasopharyngitis. No 
differences were observed in the EAIRs of other SOCs between the secukinumab dose regimens.  
Assessment report  
EMA/214413/2023 
Page 153/158 
 
 
 
 
Long term data  
The most commonly reported (≥10 per 100 subject-years) AEs by PT in the Any secukinumab group were 
headache (20.9 per 100 subject-years), (worsening of) hidradenitis and nasopharyngitis (both 14.8 per 
100 subject-years). No meaningful differences in AE frequency or clinical relevance were reported 
between the secukinumab Q2W and Q4W groups, with the majority (approximately 98%) of the reported 
AEs being non-serious, mild to moderate in severity (approximately 97%) not requiring drug 
discontinuation (approximately 99%). In the Entire Study Period, the incidence of SAEs was low and 
comparable for both secukinumab groups (7.6% in Any secukinumab Q2W, 7.5% in Any secukinumab 
Q4W) with no pattern in the type of events reported. The two deaths reported were considered unrelated 
to the study drug. 
The initially pending long-term safety data (approximately 40 %) from the two pivotal phase 3 HS studies 
was subsequently provided, as requested. The results from the assessment of these submitted full 52-
week long-term safety data of secukinumab in the treatment of HS are, overall, in line with the results of 
the initial interim (approx. 60%) results. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
On request, the MAH provided updates on the full pooled 52-week data (Safety set). No further safety 
concerns remain. Treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe HS with secukinumab, evaluated in 
two identical pivotal phase 3 studies (M2301 and M2302) at two different dose regimens (secukinumab 
300 mg Q2W and secukinumab 300 mg Q4W) showed overall a safety profile similar to that previously 
established for secukinumab across various other indications, both short-term (Treatment Period 1, up to 
Week 16) and the longer term (Entire Study Period, up to 52 weeks). In addition, the CHMP has 
recommended the MAH to submit the results of the long-term extension study M2301E1 that will provide 
additional long-term data.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Primary assessment of efficacy was based on the HiSCR50 response rate, which has been previously used 
as the basis of authorisation for adalimumab in HS; the use of HiSCR50 was also endorsed by the CHMP 
in a Scientific Advice procedure. Based on pooled data from the two studies, the HiSCR50 response rate 
at Week 16 was about 11 percentage points higher than for placebo with either of the secukinumab 
maintenance regimens. Despite the identical designs, some differences were observed between the two 
studies: in M2301, the difference in response rates between the Q2W and Q4W regimens was 3 
percentage points, and in M2302, the treatment difference vs. placebo was numerically larger for the 
Q4W regimen than the Q2W regimen. 
The magnitude of the treatment effect observed with secukinumab is considered of clinical relevance by 
the CHMP. Due to differences between secukinumab studies and the registrational studies with 
adalimumab it is not possible to directly compare their results, however secukinumab offers an 
alternative treatment for patients with HS.  
Results on secondary endpoints (reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule count, flares, and pain) 
were consistent with the HiSCR response and can be viewed as further supporting a clinically relevant 
effect of secukinumab on the symptoms and manifestations of HS. Long-term data from the 52-week 
dataset supports adequate maintenance of effect. 
No added benefit could be demonstrated for a Q2W regimen compared to a Q4W regimen, therefore at 
the CHMP request the MAH proposed an escalation strategy in patients with an insufficient response, 
similar to that already authorised for several other indications for Cosentyx. 
With respect to the proposed indication, it is noted that consistent effects were seen between Hurley 
stages II and III; it is thereby agreed that the indication can cover patients with moderate to severe HS. 
It is understood that the proposed indication “moderate to severe” is likely to be interpreted as referring 
to Hurley stages II and III and can thereby be justified. In addition the MAH agreed to update the 
indication to mention “active” in it, as a qualifier for disease state. The indication is therefore acceptable 
for the CHMP. 
Currently, after assessment of the short term and long-term safety data, the safety profile of 
secukinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe HS appears favourable.  
No new or unexpected safety signals were evident. The generally favourable risk profile is also supported 
by substantial experience in the post-marketing setting across the already authorised therapeutic 
indications.  
The long-term extension study of studies M2301 and M2302 (M2301E1) is noted, the CHMP recommends 
the MAH to submit these results for assessment once they become available. Data from the extension 
study are not considered essential in the context of the current variation application.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The treatment effect for secukinumab in HS, as regards data at Week 16, can be considered adequately 
demonstrated, and while it is of quite modest magnitude, it can be considered clinically relevant, 
particularly when contextualised with the dearth of currently available therapies for this difficult disease. 
The clinical relevance is supported by safety data that is in line with the favourable profile observed in 
previous studies in other conditions as well as post-marketing experience. Long-term data from the HS 
studies support maintenance of effect as well as an acceptable safety profile until Week 52. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cosentyx is positive in the following indication: 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy (see section 5.1). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) for cosentyx, based on 
results from two Phase 3 studies CAIN457M2301 (SUNSHINE) and CAIN457M2302 (SUNRISE). These 
studies are multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 3 studies 
conducted to assess the short (16 weeks) and long-term (up to 52 weeks) efficacy and safety of two 
secukinumab dose regimens (Q2W or Q4W) compared to placebo in adult subjects with moderate to 
severe HS. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 11.1 of the RMP has also been approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

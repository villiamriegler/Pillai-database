1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Fulvestrant is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen 
therapy or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. The Marketing Authorisation was 
granted on 10 March 2004. 
Fulvestrant is an anti-estrogen without agonist properties. It blocks the trophic actions of estrogens 
without itself having any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity on the endometrium of post-
menopausal women. Fulvestrant binds to estrogen receptor (ER) in a competitive manner with a high 
affinity comparable with that of oestradiol. 
The recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given 
two weeks after the initial dose. It is a long acting (LA) injection, designed to deliver the required dose 
of 500 mg of fulvestrant over a 1 month period from two consecutive 5 ml injections (pre-filled 
syringes contains 250 mg fulvestrant in 5 ml solution) by slow intramuscular injection (1-2 
minutes/injection), one in each  buttock. 
In  this  application,  the  MAH  re-evaluated  data  from  a  previously  submitted  pivotal  study  CONFIRM 
(assessed by CHMP as part of FUM 005), as well as supportive studies NEWEST and FINDER1/FINDER2 
(assessed  as  part  of  FUM  006  and  Type  II-17  respectively),  to  support  an  extension  of  indication  to 
include  patients  who  have  failed  on  aromatase  inhibitor  therapy.  Considering  that  the  extension  of 
indication was not approvable by the CHMP, the MAH agreed on an update of the section 5.1 in regards 
to the data submitted. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to remove information on potential risk of osteoporosis in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC, and to include data from the NEWEST study relating to mechanism of action, effects on 
bone and postmenopausal endometrium in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the MAH proposed 
to remove information on ‘venous thromboembolism’ from sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision (P/146/2009) on the granting of a class waiver. 
1.2.  Non-Clinical aspects 
No new pre-clinical toxicity studies have been submitted in this application, however the highest dose 
levels used in the preclinical toxicological studies conducted for the original application (250 mg/month) 
corresponded to exposure ratios of 2-5 times the ones expected upon the proposed human maximal 
dose (500 mg/month). The safety margins achieved at the No Observed Adverse Effect Levels 
(NOAEL’s) in these studies against the 500 mg dose used in the current variation are summarised in 
Table 1.

Major findings in the toxicological studies, especially findings such as vasculitis and arteritis in dogs, 
were re-assessed in relation to this exposure. The MAH discussed the reasons why these toxicological 
findings were not considered related to treatment, in part because these changes may be related to 
the specific strain of Beagle dogs used, however the CHMP was of the opinion that a treatment related 
effect could not be totally excluded and information regarding these findings has been added to Section 
5.3 of the SPC. In addition 'vasculitis' is currently included as a potential risk within the fulvestrant EU 
RMP. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
The CONFIRM study (D66997C00002 [9238IL/0064]), a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, 
multicentre study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ER antagonist fulvestrant in post-
menopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor positive disease, who have relapsed or 
progressed on prior endocrine therapy. The study was assessed by CHMP as part of FUM 005 and was 
the basis to support an extension of the indication to include patients who have failed on prior 
aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
In addition data from three phase II studies were assessed during the review. Two of these, FINDER1 
and FINDER2, included patient populations relevant to the sought indication, whereas NEWEST studied 
fulvestrant in another setting. Unlike the CONFIRM study which included patients with non-measurable 
as well as measurable disease, the FINDER studies only included patients with measurable disease. 
The FINDER studies also included a treatment arm denoted as the 250 mg loading dose regimen 
(250mg + LD).

Clinical Pharmacology 
This variation included clinical pharmacology data from the three clinical phase II studies NEWEST, 
FINDER 1 and FINDER 2. Data from the neoadjuvant study NEWEST were the basis for proposed 
changes relating to the mechanism of action, effects on bone and postmenopausal endometrium in 
section 5.1. This data had been previously assessed by CHMP as part of FUM 006. 
The NEWEST study was a randomised, open-label, Phase II multicentre study in postmenopausal 
women with newly diagnosed ER+ breast cancer. The study incorporated a screening phase, a 
treatment phase, a study completion visit at Week 16 (unless treatment discontinuation criteria were 
met earlier), surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving) for tumour removal, and a follow-up safety 
visit 8 weeks after surgery or on their 6th visit (as applicable). 
The targeted population included women with histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive ER+ 
breast cancer who were postmenopausal as defined by one of the following criterion: (1) ≥60 years old, 
(2) ≥45 years old with amenorrhea for at least 12 months and an intact uterus, (3) history of bilateral 
oophorectomy, or (4) estradiol and follicle-stimulating-hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal 
range (as determined by the testing laboratory). Tumors had to be newly diagnosed and either 
operable or potentially operable depending on the degree of advancement; the largest tumour 
diameter had to measure at least 2 cm. (Acceptable TNM classifications were T2, 3, 4b, N0-3, M0). 
Patients also had to have a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and be 
willing to undergo biopsies and surgery as outlined in the protocol. Patients with more than 2 major

tumour nodules or metastatic disease and patients previously treated for breast cancer were not 
eligible for study participation. Additional criteria excluded patients with conditions that could 
potentially interfere with efficacy evaluations or pose unacceptable health risks. 
Patients who met study entry criteria were assigned to 1 of 2 randomised treatments: either 
fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly (im) every 28 days, with a supplemental loading dose given on Day 
14 (total of 5 doses) or fulvestrant 250 mg im every 28 days (total of 4 doses). Treatment at each 
dosage extended across a 16-week period. Patients assigned to the 500-mg dosage received 2 
injections on Days 0, 14, 28, 56, and 84. Patients assigned to the 250-mg dosage received single 
injections on Days 0, 28, 56, and 84.  
The primary objective was to compare the effects of fulvestrant 500 mg and fulvestrant 250 mg on the 
proliferation marker Ki67 after 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary objectives were to compare the 
tolerability of fulvestrant 500 mg with that of fulvestrant 250 mg; to compare the effects of fulvestrant 
500 mg and fulvestrant 250 mg on serum bone markers, endometrial thickness, and uterine 
dimensions; to assess the correlation between changes in Ki67 labeling index (LI) and changes in 
estrogen-receptor (ER) expression and progesterone-receptor (PgR) expression; to compare the 
effects of fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg on tumour response assessed by ultrasound; to compare actual 
surgery performed at 16 weeks with the baseline-predicted feasible surgery for each treatment group; 
and to correlate response after 16 weeks of treatment with biological endpoints detected after 4 and 
16 weeks of treatment. 
Criteria for evaluation (main endpoints): 
- Primary endpoint: Ki67 LI at Week 4 (change from baseline) 
- Secondary endpoints: changes from baseline in ER index, PgR index, and Ki67 LI (at Weeks 4 and 
16); tumour response rate as assessed by changes in tumour volume (per ultrasound); extent of 
breast surgery; change from baseline in Ki67 LI, ER index, PgR index, and HER-2, by responder status 
at Week 16; responder status at Week 16 by HER-1 and HER-2 expression at baseline. 
Sample size was calculated relative to change in Ki67 LI from baseline to Week 4. Using a standard 
deviation of 0.616% (taken from an earlier study, which looked at pre- and post dose Ki67 LI after a 
single 250-mg dose of fulvestrant), 80 patients per treatment group were required to provide 80% 
power to detect a 24% decrease in Ki67 LI at Week 4 for fulvestrant 500 mg relative to fulvestrant 250 
mg at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
The population assigned to randomised treatment (ITT) comprised 211 women enrolled from 36 
investigational sites. Patients were assigned to treatment as follows: 109 to treatment with fulvestrant 
500 mg and 102 to treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg. 
Mechanism of action (Ki67 and ER) 
Results from the neoadjuvant NEWEST study were the basis for the MAH proposal to include data in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding mechanism of action, i.e. effect on proliferation marker Ki67 and 
the estrogen receptor (ER). 
Ki67 
The fulvestrant 500-mg regimen reduced Ki67 LI to a significantly greater extent, compared with 
fulvestrant 250 mg (mean % change: –78.8% vs. –47.4%, respectively, p<0.0001) after 4 weeks of 
treatment. At Week 16, reduction in Ki67 LI was still greater at the higher dosage (–77.4% and –
62.8% for the 500- and 250-mg dosages, respectively) but, in an exploratory analysis, the difference 
was not statistically significant (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Change (mean % reduction) in Ki67 LI at Weeks 4 and 16 in the NEWEST study 
In conclusion it has been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates the proliferation marker Ki67, 
to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal neoadjuvant setting. 
Estrogen receptor 
Both dosages of fulvestrant reduced ER expression at Weeks 4 and 16, with greater effects seen at the 
500 mg dosage. In an exploratory analysis, mean % reduction in ER expression (downregulation) at 
Week 4 was significantly greater for the 500 mg treatment group, compared with that for the 250 mg 
treatment group (–25.0% vs –13.5%, p=0.0002) (Figure 2). Correlations between change from 
baseline in Ki67 LI and ER index were not apparent.

In conclusion it has been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates ER and the proliferation 
marker Ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal 
neoadjuvant setting. 
Bone biomarkers 
Data from the NEWEST study were the basis for the conclusions on the effect of fulvestrant on bone.  A 
secondary objective of the NEWEST study was to compare the effects of the fulvestrant 500 mg and 
250 mg regimens on three serum bone-turnover markers, i.e. bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (b-
ALP), c-telopeptide type 1 collagen crosslinks (CTX-1), and procollagen type 1 amino terminal 
propeptide (PINP). See tables 3, 4 and 5 for results.

In conclusion, neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either 
Fulvestrant 500 mg or Fulvestrant 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in serum bone-
turnover markers. 
Effects on endometrium 
Based on the NEWEST study the MAH proposed to add information on the effects of fulvestrant on the 
postmenopausal endometrium. The results are shown in table 6 below.

In conclusion neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either 
Fulvestrant 500 mg or Fulvestrant 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial 
thickness, indicating a lack of agonist effect. There is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the 
breast cancer patients studied. 
 
Clinical efficacy 
MAIN STUDY 
The CONFIRM study (D66997C00002 [9238IL/0064]) is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, 
multicentre study comparing two doses of the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist fulvestrant in post-
menopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor positive disease, who have relapsed or 
progressed on prior endocrine therapy.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The CONFIRM study included postmenopausal women with histologically/cytologically confirmed 
estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer, who had either relapsed while on adjuvant 
endocrine therapy (or within 12 months of its completion), or progressed on first endocrine therapy for 
advanced disease (including de novo advanced disease). Measurable disease according to RECIST 
criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) or bone lesions was required, as well as 
baseline WHO performance status of 0-2, adequate liver function and platelet levels, and written 
informed consent.  
Important exclusion criteria were presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, more than 
one chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, more than one regimen of endocrine therapy for 
advanced disease (not counting oophorectomy, ovarian ablation or LHRH analogue therapy), bleeding 
tendency/disorder or anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin allowed), and severe 
concomitant medical condition.  
Restrictions regarding a number of concomitant treatments were also applied, including anticancer 
substances, radiotherapy (need for it counted as progression), bisphosphonate treatment for the 
prevention (but not management) of bone metastases, systemic sex hormone containing drugs, other 
drugs possibly affecting sex hormone status or disease response (such as systemic ketokonazole, 
corticosteroids and adrenocortical suppressants), and anti-platelet therapy. 
Treatments 
Patients received either fulvestrant 500 mg or 250 mg every 28 days. The 500 mg arm also included 
one extra dose on Day 14 of the first treatment cycle:  
 
Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered as two 5 ml intramuscular injections, one in each buttock, 
on Days 0, 14, 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter. 
 
Fulvestrant 250 mg was administered as two 5 ml intramuscular injections (1 fulvestrant 
injection plus 1 placebo injection), one in each buttock, on Days 0, 14 (2 placebo injections 
only), 28 and every 28 (±3) days thereafter.  
Treatment continued until disease progression, unless any of the other criteria for discontinuation were 
met first. Upon progression, the patients were withdrawn from their randomised treatment. 
Discontinuation criteria were: voluntary discontinuation by the patient, safety reasons, severe non-
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000540/II/0018  
EMA/688361/2010  
Page 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compliance to protocol, disease progression, patient lost to follow-up, other reason according to 
investigator’s judgement.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of fulvestrant 500 mg treatment with fulvestrant 
250 mg treatment in terms of time to progression. Primary and secondary objectives are summarised 
in Table7. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Time to Progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. TTP was defined as the time from randomisation 
to the time of the earliest evidence of objective disease progression or death from any cause prior to 
documented progression. The definition of TTP used in this study is also commonly referred to as 
Progression Free Survival (PFS). TTP was assessed by objective tumour assessments every 12 weeks 
using RECIST criteria, except for those patients with bone only disease. For secondary objectives and 
the variables used to assess them see Table 7.

were collected from a subgroup of patients. 
For the response to last endocrine therapy before fulvestrant, patients were categorised as 
“responsive” if they had recurrence after 2 or more years on their last previous adjuvant endocrine 
therapy, or if they experienced complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) 
for at least 24 weeks on first line endocrine therapy for advanced cancer.  
Patients were categorised as “not responsive” if they had recurrence after less than 2 years on their 
last previous adjuvant endocrine therapy, or if they experienced SD for less than 24 weeks or 
progressive disease (PD) on first line endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer. 
Safety data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), 
including physicians and statisticians. 
Sample size 
A total number of 736 patients were randomised from 128 participating centres in 17 countries 
(Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Poland, Russia, 
Slovakia, Spain, USA, Ukraine and Venezuela) between 8 February 2005 and 31 August 2007.  
Data cut-off date was 28 February 2009.  
Randomisation method  
Patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomised into the study 1:1 to receive either 
fulvestrant 500 mg (including one extra dose on the first Day 14) or 250 mg every 4 weeks, according 
to a computer generated randomisation schedule. Patients were allocated treatment in balanced blocks.  
Blinding 
All study personnel were unaware of the randomised treatment until all decisions on the quality of data 
from all patients had been made and documented. The single-dose pre-filled syringes supplied for the 
injections of active study drug and placebo, respectively, looked identical. Both contained 5 ml of 
castor oil based solution with /without 250 mg of fulvestrant. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint TTP, was an unadjusted log-rank test. Two-sided tests 
were performed. 
The secondary analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for treatment 
and six other predefined baseline covariates:  
  Age (≤ 65 years vs. >65) 
  Response to last therapy received prior to fulvestrant (recurrence vs. progression) 
  Receptor status at diagnosis (both ER+ and PgR+ vs. ER+ and PgR other) 
  Visceral involvement (Yes vs. No) 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000540/II/0018  
EMA/688361/2010

 
Last therapy received prior to fulvestrant (Aromatase Inhibitor vs. Anti-Estrogen 
Therapy) 
  Measurable disease (Yes vs. No) 
The secondary endpoints were analysed as follows: 
- OS was analysed by an unadjusted log-rank two-sided test.  
- ORR and CBR were analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment factor only. 
- DoR and DoCB were analysed in those patients who received an OR or CB, respectively.  
- Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was studied using a longitudinal model including treatment and 
other covariates. 
An additional analysis of Expected duration of response (EDoR) and Expected duration of clinical 
benefit (EDoCB) was performed by fitting a log-normal distribution to the durations. The EDoR/EDoCB 
is calculated based on all patients and not only those who responded. The EDoR/EDoCB gives the 
average probability of being in response/clinical benefit for all patients, thereby allowing formal and 
unbiased comparison of treatments for DoR/DoCB. 
Efficacy and HRQoL endpoints were analysed according to the randomised treatment, using the Full 
Analysis Set (FAS), and the subset of FAS who took part in HRQoL registration. Objective response was 
analysed in the Evaluable for Response Set (ERS), another subset of FAS. Safety endpoints were 
analysed according to the treatment actually received, using the Safety Analysis Set. The primary 
endpoint was also analysed in the Per Protocol Set (PPS), including only those patients who received 
treatment and did not have any important protocol deviations or violations. 
No interim analyses were performed in this study.

28 Feb 2009
Recruitment 
Patients were “enrolled” after signing the Informed Consent form and subsequently screened for the 
study. Eligible patients were then randomised into the study. Recruitment dates and numbers of 
patients are shown in the participant flow chart above. 
Before start of each new treatment cycle physical examination was performed and patients were 
assessed with regard to adverse events, concomitant therapy, and quality of life (the latter only in a 
subgroup of patients). Adverse events and concomitant therapy were followed until 8 weeks after last 
injection. 
Laboratory assessments (haematology and biochemistry) were performed before treatment cycles 1, 2 
and 4 (week 0, 4 and 12) and at 12 week intervals thereafter. 
Tumour assessments, using the same methodology each time and according to RECIST criteria, were 
performed every 12 weeks. When an objective response of CR or PR was found, a repeated imaging 
was performed 4 weeks thereafter.

After progression, patients were followed with regard to survival every 12 weeks, and details of type of 
first subsequent systemic breast cancer treatment and response thereon. 
Conduct of the study 
Important protocol deviations occurred in 48 patients in the fulvestrant 500 mg treatment arm and 59 
in the fulvestrant 250 mg arm, leaving 314 and 315 patients, respectively, evaluable for Per Protocol 
analysis.  
These deviations included eligibility criteria not fulfilled (n = 26+29 in the 500 mg and 250 mg mg 
treatment groups, respectively), fulvestrant never administered (n = 1+0), 2 or more consecutive 
fulvestrant injections missed (n = 1+1), use of prohibited concomitant pharmaceuticals (sex hormones, 
n = 2+0), non-compliance with unblinding procedures (n = 2+3), screening RECIST assessments not 
performed within specified time window or not at all (n = 18 + 38).  
Baseline data  
Baseline tumour and disease characteristics are shown in Tables 8-11. The median patient age was 
approximately 61 years, median weight 69 kg, and 96% were of Caucasian ethnicity in both treatment 
groups (not shown).

Numbers analysed 
Five analysis sets were used (Table 12 and participant flow chart):  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised patients and compared the treatment 
groups on the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of treatment actually received 
(Intention to treat). 
 
The Safety Analysis Set included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the 
study treatment and compared the treatment groups on the basis of treatment actually 
received. 
 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) included all treated patients who did not have any important 
protocol deviations or violations. Exclusion from the PPS was determined by a blinded medical 
review of protocol deviations. (See below regarding type of deviations.) 
 
The Evaluable for Response Set (ERS) included all randomised patients (regardless of whether 
any study treatment was received) for whom objective response could be assessed. The reason 
for exclusion from Evaluable for Response Set was no target lesion at baseline. 
  Additionally, HRQoL was analysed in a subset of the FAS consisting of women from English and 
Spanish speaking countries, Italy and Brazil since the FACT-B questionnaire used to assess this 
endpoint was readily available in relevant languages for these countries.

Overall survival 
At data cut-off (DCO) 175 patients (48 %) in the 500 mg treatment group and 203 (54 %) of the 
patients in the 250 mg arm had died. The overall survival analysis showed a median time to death of 
25.1 and 22.8 months in the two treatment groups, respectively (see Table 14). A Kaplan-Meier plot is 
shown in Figure 4.  
The hazard ratio for death in the unadjusted log-rank analysis was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 
0.69 – 1.03), p= 0.091. A retrospective analysis of OS, adjusted for the 6 predefined baseline 
covariates, showed similar results: HR 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.66 – 0.99), p= 0.037.

Quality of Life 
A total of 145 patients completed a baseline FACT-B questionnaire, which represented 82% of the 176 
patients randomised in the countries that participated in HRQoL collection.  
The on-treatment HRQoL in both treatment arms was good (mean TOI score of approximately 60 out 
of 92). Patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg had a similar on-treatment HRQoL to patients treated 
with fulvestrant 250 mg and there were no statistically significant differences between the two 
treatment groups in terms of change in on treatment HRQoL as measured by both the TOI and FACT-B 
score, although there was a numerical advantage in TOI in favour of fulvestrant 500 mg. 
Effect of fulvestrant after failure on anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor therapy 
In comparison, the corresponding hazard ratio for TTP in the subgroup of patients who 
progressed/relapsed during ongoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) or anti-estrogen (AO) therapy was 0.80 
with 2-sided 95% CI: 0.68; 0.94 (p= 0.006). The effect of fulvestrant after aromatase inhibitor versus 
after antiestrogen therapy was also analysed at the level of secondary endpoints (see Table 15).

Table 15. Comparison of exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints in CONFIRM by last endocrine 
therapy subgroup. 
The types of response differed between the AI and the AO groups, with 2.8 % complete responses (CR) 
in the 500 mg group and 0.7% in the 250 mg group following AO, compared with no CRs following AI. 
The rates of partial response (PR) were also higher following AO: 15.3% and 18.4% in the 500 mg and 
250 mg groups, respectively, compared with 7.3% and 8.3% following AI. The rates of stable disease 
in the Evaluable for Response Set were similar following AO and AI; AO, 41.0% and 39.5%, AI, 40.6% 
and 39.4%, in the 500 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively. 
The treatment effect of fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg was consistent in patients who had 
relapsed/progressed on prior aromatase inhibitor therapy vs. antiestrogen therapy (see figure 5).

Figure 5. Forest plot of analyses of CONFIRM data by last endocrine therapy subgroup 
The interaction between prior endocrine therapy and the fulvestrant treatment effect was tested for the 
efficacy endpoints of CONFIRM (TTP, OS, ORR, and CBR). For each endpoint, the interaction test was 
non-significant with p-values ≥0.3.  
In response to CHMP questions and in order to further increase the stringency regarding aromatase 
inhibitor resistance, exploratory analyses of TTP and ORR were performed which excluded the patients 
who relapsed 0-12 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy. Thus only patients who 
progressed during ongoing endocrine therapy were included. Analyses of patients subdivided with 
regard to failure in the adjuvant or metastatic settings were also performed (Tables 16 and 17).

of fulvestrant in the endocrine subgroups in CONFIRM (see Tables 19 and 20).

The MAH was also requested to provide further data on the efficacy of fulvestrant in the following 
subgroups of subjects with AI as last endocrine therapy in CONFIRM: a) different prior lines of 
endocrine therapies (e.g. AI vs. AO followed by AI) and b) different AI regimen as last therapy (non-
steroidal AI vs. exemestane). The analysis for TTP is summarised in Table 21.

The relevance of the evidence of efficacy demonstrated in patients failing antiestrogen to patients 
failing aromatase inhibitors was also discussed. The prognosis (in terms of TTP, ORR and CBR) 
observed in CONFIRM was worse for patients who have failed on an AI compared to patients who have 
failed on an AO (see Table 22).

SUPPORTIVE STUDIES 
Phase II FINDER studies 
The data from the FINDER studies described below refer to the two treatment arms relevant for the 
comparison with CONFIRM. 
The median age in FINDER1 was 61years in both the 500 mg and the 250 mg treatment arms, 
respectively; median weight was 52 and 55 kg, and ethnicity was 100% Japanese.  
In FINDER2 the median age was 67 and 63 years in the 500 mg and the 250 mg treatment groups, 
respectively. The weight differed considerably from the Japanese study, with median weights at 71 and 
68 kg in the two treatment groups, respectively. Ethnicity was 98% Caucasian.

EMA/688361/2010  
Page 28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In FINDER1 the patients in the 500 mg group were more heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy (70%) 
and radiotherapy (45%) than those in the 250 mg group (56% and 33%, respectively).  
Similar proportions of the patients who had received prior aromatase inhibitor therapy were seen in 
FINDER2 and FINDER1, but different drugs were used. Letrozole was not used in FINDER1. 
Last prior endocrine therapy was an aromatase inhibitor in approximately 80% of both treatment arms 
in FINDER1, and 76 vs. 66% in the 500 mg vs. 250 mg arms in FINDER2. 
The expected proportion of patients with moderately differentiated > poorly differentiated > well 
differentiated tumours which was present in CONFIRM was also present in both treatment arms of 
FINDER1, but not in FINDER2 where the 250 mg group had a higher proportion than expected of 
patients with poorly differentiated tumours (34% vs. 31% moderately differentiated).  
All patients were ER positive and 2/3 of the patients were PgR positive in both studies (as in CONFIRM).  
Metastatic disease was present in 99% of patients in FINDER1 and 97% in FINDER2 (98% in 
CONFIRM). The presence of visceral disease was lower in FINDER1 (58%) compared with FINDER2 
(76%) and CONFIRM (64%). 
Baseline data are similar to the main study CONFIRM, with a few exceptions including (among others) 
ethnicity and weight in FINDER1, and a higher frequency of aromatase inhibitor as last prior endocrine 
therapy in both FINDER studies compared with CONFIRM. 
The primary objective of the two FINDER studies was ORR, which was a secondary objective in the 
CONFIRM study.  
The overall level of objective response and clinical benefit was similar in all three studies. None of the 
studies showed statistically significant differences between treatment arms. No difference in ORR or 
CBR was seen between the two treatment arms in FINDER1. FINDER2 showed a numerical difference in 
favour of the 500 mg regimen for both ORR and CBR, whereas in CONFIRM a relevant numerical 
difference was seen only for CBR, however not statistically significant. 
Time to progression (TTP) was a secondary objective in the FINDER studies and primary objective in 
CONFIRM. Kaplan-Meier curves for TTP are shown in Figure 5. The TTP data is based on 84% of 
patients having progressed in the CONFIRM study, compared with 66% and 71% in FINDER1 and 2, 
respectively. The definition of TTP is equivalent to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all three studies. 
Additional supportive studies apart from the main study (CONFIRM) and FINDER1, FINDER2 and 
NEWEST described above were submitted in support of the application (see Table 23).

In response to CHMP questions the  MAH was asked to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg 
should be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy (overall response rate 
8%), as a trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose was not considered sufficient. The data 
provided is summarised in Tables 24 and 25.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
One of the major drawbacks of the pivotal study was the fact that lack of adequate control (placebo) 
made it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant in subjects with AI as last endocrine therapy in 
CONFIRM. A trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose was not considered sufficient and there 
was not enough evidence to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg should be regarded as 
efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
Some imbalances were also observed at baseline between the endocrine subgroups (prior AI vs. prior 
AO as last endocrine therapy) regarding the number of prior (endocrine) treatments, the disease 
setting (adjuvant vs advanced) and age. These imbalances may partly explain the differences in 
activity of fulvestrant in the endocrine subgroups. In addition it made extrapolation between the two 
subgroups difficult. On the other hand, no mechanistic or other reasons were put forward in order to 
support the notion that the efficacy shown in the AO group would provide support in the interpretation 
of the results in the AI group. 
Further to the assessment of the data submitted in the variation application and in the responses to 
the CHMP requests for supplementary information, the CHMP considered that efficacy data to support 
an extension of indication in this patient population was insufficient. However the CHMP considered 
acceptable to include relevant data on patients who have failed on prior anti estrogen and aromatase 
inhibitor therapy by subgroup in section 5.1 of the SmPC as the information can be helpful for the 
prescriber. In addition, the MAH has committed to provide more mature data on overall survival as a 
follow up measure. 
 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis set included all patients who received the study drug. Only one of the study 
patients was excluded from the safety analysis set due to not receiving fulvestrant. The duration of the 
exposure is shown in Table 26.

Discontinuation due to AEs 
Seventeen patients had AEs that led to discontinuation of study (DAEs), 8 in the 500 mg group and 9 
in the 250 mg group. Five of these patients had DAEs that were considered to be possibly causally 
related to study treatment. In the 500 mg group 2 patients together had a total of 3 causally related 
DAEs: dysphagia, hypersensitivity and interstitial lung disease. In the 250 mg group 3 patients had 1 
causally related DAE each: acute respiratory failure, injection site erythema, and hypertension. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
A total of 11 patients died following an AE during the treatment period, from 1st fulvestrant dose until 
56 days after last dose. The AEs that ended in death were the following in the 500 mg group: 
Dyspnoea (2 patients), cardiopulmonary failure (1 patient), abdominal pain + vomiting + unknown 
cause of death (1 patient), and intestinal adenocarcinoma (1 patient). In the 250 mg treatment arm 
the AEs ending in death were: respiratory aspiration (1 patient), acute myocardial infarction (1 patient), 
meningitis (1 patient), suicide (1 patient), acute renal failure (1 patient), and hypertension (1 patient). 
Of these 11 cases of AEs, only the last one, hypertension, was considered causally related to the study 
medication by the investigator.

Causally related SAEs 
Of all the SAEs only two, one in each treatment arm, were considered possibly causally related to the 
fulvestrant therapy by the investigator: 
In the 500 mg group a 57 year old woman experienced interstitial lung disease (CTCAE grade 2) and 
left bronchopneumonia (CTCAE grade 2), which started 232 days from start of treatment and 7 days 
after discontinuation of study. Transbronchial biopsies showed advanced interstitial fibrosis, with 
presence of moderate dense inflammation infiltration, and without evidence of breast cancer 
metastasis. Microbiology tests were positive for Haemophilius influenzae. The events were considered 
serious due to hospitalisation. The patient was treated with moxifloxacin and was discharged from 
hospital 9 days later; however, at the time of DCO she had not yet recovered. The interstitial lung 
disease was considered as causally related to study therapy by investigator. The patient had a medical 
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and had received prior chemotherapy, which could 
have put the patient at risk of developing interstitial fibrosis. 
In the 250 mg group a 63 year old woman experienced hypertension and generalised weakness, which 
occurred 48 days from start of treatment and 19 days after last dose (day 1 cycle 2). She died 23 days 
later due to “hypertension”. The patient had a history of diabetes and concurrent treatment with a 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ketorolac tromethamine, for which hypertension is a listed event, 
which could provide an alternative explanation for the event.

Joint disorders 
Fulvestrant is a competitive ER antagonist and is associated with down-regulation of ER protein levels. 
ERs have been identified in many structures that are found in rheumatoid arthritic or osteoarthritic 
joints, including synovial cells. AstraZeneca’s worldwide safety database was searched up to 31 July 
2009 for reports of joint disorders in patients receiving fulvestrant. This identified 113 events in 105 
patients. 42.55% were serious.  
In the FIRST study, the frequency of joint disorders was higher in the fulvestrant 500 mg arm (13.9%, 
[14/101]) compared with the anastrozole 1 mg arm (9.7%, [10/103]). A prospective, formal statistical 
analysis was performed, which showed that the difference in the frequency of joint disorders between 
the two arms was not statistically significant (p=0.391). Joint pain/stiffness is listed as a common 
adverse reaction for anastrozole.  
In the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (CONFIRM, 
FINDER1, FINDER2 and NEWEST), the frequency of joint disorders in each arm was: 
500 mg arm: 12.1% (68/560 patients) 
250 mg arm: 10.6% (60/567 patients) 
In the Clinical Study Reports for CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER, a broader group of MedDRA 
Preferred Terms was included in the predefined adverse event of ‘joint disorders’ including the 
Preferred Terms, back pain and neck pain. Using this broader group of Preferred Terms, the frequency 
of joint disorders in each arm of the pooled analysis was: 
500 mg arm: 17.1% (96/560 patients) 
250 mg arm: 17.5% (99/567 patients) 
Following a request for supplementary information the MAH provided additional information on the 
frequencies of joint disorders irrespective of causality (see Table 31).

Table 31. Summary of reports in joint disorders in Fulvestrant studies. 
In addition based on literature the MAH discussed aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia and 
summarised the different possible pathomechanisms of joint disorders in postmenopausal women with 
breast cancer, focusing on the possible role of estrogen in join symptoms. The lack of joint disorders 
associated with the treatment of fulvestrant was convincingly demonstrated.  
Osteoporosis 
Pooled analysis were performed on the CONFIRM, FINDER1, FINDER2, and NEWEST studies, which all 
compare fulvestrant at 500mg and 250 mg dose regimens. The frequency of events of osteoporosis 
and fractures are shown in Table 32. No events of reduced bone mineral density or osteopenia were 
reported. Based on these data the MAH initially requested to remove potential risk of osteoporosis from 
the SmPC section 4.4. and PL section 2.

There is no significant difference in the reporting of osteoporosis or fracture in the dose comparing 
studies, however it should be noted that the NEWEST study (including over 200 patients) was an open 
study with potential risk of bias in the reporting of adverse events. In NEWEST 2 cases of osteoporosis 
were seen in the 500 mg arm and none in the 250 mg arm. Even when taking this into account no 
clinically significant difference is seen in the osteoporosis related adverse events of the dose comparing 
studies. 
The potential mechanism for fulvestrant to cause osteoporosis is based on the down-regulation of the 
estrogen receptor (ER) by competitive binding to the ER. Both ER-alpha and ER-beta are present in 
bone and estrogens acting on these receptors are known to decrease osteoclast and increase 
osteoblast cell numbers thus increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption.  
The request to remove the potential risk of osteoporosis from the SmPC was not accepted due to the 
fact that although bone turn-over markers in the NEWEST study were unaffected by 16 weeks of 
treatment with fulvestrant (see section on bone biomarkers, Tables 2, 3 and 4), the ability of the bone 
turn-over marker study to detect long-term effects on bone was questioned and the potential risk of 
osteoporosis could not be discarded. Nevertheless section 5.1 has been updated to reflect the data 
provided for the NEWEST study. 
Venous thromboembolism 
Based primarily on data from the CONFIRM study and nine supportive clinical trials (see Table 22)  the 
MAH requested to remove venous thromboembolism from the precautions for use and the list of 
adverse drug reactions in the SmPC sections 4.4. and 4.8 and PL section 2.  
The experience of venous thromboembolism and fulvestrant and the frequency of such events are 
summarised in Tables 33 and 34.  
Table 33. Incidence of venous thromboembolic events in Fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg studies 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000540/II/0018  
EMA/688361/2010  
Page 38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 34. Incidence of venous thromboembolic events in other Fulvestrant studies 
The MAH also referred to published literature in which the frequency of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 
and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with and without cancer using sampled data from the 
National Hospital Discharge Survey 1979-1999 was evaluated. In patients with breast cancer the 
frequency of a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (defined as DVT or PE) was 1.7/100 
hospitalisations, compared with 1.0/100 hospitalisations in patients without a cancer diagnosis. 
A search has also been performed in AstraZeneca’s worldwide safety database for venous 
thromboembolism-related MedDRA preferred terms, which identified 103 reports describing 111 
venous thromboembolic events. In 91 of the reports risk factors for the development of venous 
thromboembolic events were present, and in three other reports concomitant medications that may 
also have resulted in the events were present, i.e. megestrol, capecitabine, and tamoxifen, 
respectively. These data from spontaneous reporting does however not rule out the possibility of 
fulvestrant harbouring a thrombogenic effect. 
Quantitative signal detection for VTE and fulvestrant has also been performed using the AstraZeneca’s 
worldwide safety database and the FDA AERS database by calculating the Empirical Bayesian 
Geometric Mean (EBGM) along with a 90% confidence interval (EB05 to EB95) and the AstraZeneca 
recommended signal threshold of EB05 ≥ 1.8. The relevant MedDRA preferred term which met the 
AstraZeneca’s criteria for a potential safety signal was pulmonary embolism, with EB05s of 1.9 in the 
AstraZeneca database and 2.7 in the FDA database. 
In addition, theoretical potential mechanisms by which fulvestrant might cause or contribute to the risk 
of venous thromboembolism have been identified:  
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-1(TFPI) is the physiological inhibitor of the tissue factor pathway of 
coagulation. One in vitro study showed that protein levels of TFPI in human endothelial cell cultures 
were reduced by the addition of the following compounds (at a concentration of 10nM): 17β-estradiol 
(34% reduction), 17α-ethinylestradiol (21%), raloxifene (28%), tamoxifen (16%), and fulvestrant (9% 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000540/II/0018  
EMA/688361/2010  
Page 39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction of TFPI). The cells used did not express the regular nuclear 66kDa ERα, but instead a 45 kDa 
ERα, which was not regulated by estrogens or ER modulators. 
Based on available data the MAH has not been able to prove or make plausible the absence of a causal 
relationship in a situation where potential mechanisms for the ADR exists. Therefore the request 
remove venous thromboembolism from the product information was not accepted. 
Increased risk of bleeding at the injection site 
AstraZeneca’s worldwide safety database was searched up to 31 July 2009 for reports of bleeding 
events at the injection site in patients receiving fulvestrant. This search identified 9 events (all non-
serious) in 9 patients. The outcomes of the events were: recovered without sequelae (2 events), not 
yet recovered (1 event) and unknown (6 events). 
In the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (CONFIRM, 
FINDER1, FINDER2 and NEWEST), there were 7 bleeding events at the injection site in the 500 mg 
arm; the outcomes of these events were recovered (6 events) and not yet recovered (1 event). In the 
250 mg arm, there were 2 events of bleeding at the injection site; the outcomes of these 2 events 
were recovered. All 9 events were considered to be non-serious by the investigators. 
In the pooled analysis of studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg (CONFIRM, 
FINDER1, FINDER2 and NEWEST), the frequency of bleeding events at the injection site in each arm 
was: 
500 mg arm: 1.3% (7/560 patients) 
250 mg arm: 0.4% (2/567 patients) 
Risk factors for a bleeding event following intramuscular administration include the presence of 
bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or concomitant treatment with anticoagulants. 
Due to the intramuscular route of administration, fulvestrant should be used with caution if treating 
patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment (see 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC). Specific exclusion criteria and restrictions are in place for the studies 
included in the fulvestrant clinical development programme. In addition, all events reported in at risk 
patients are monitored to ensure that the warnings are adequate to reduce or manage patient risk. 
The CHMP considered that bleeding at the injection site is an important identified risk. In addition to 
the existing warnings in the Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding patients with bleeding diatheses, 
thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment; the CHMP considered necessary to include 
bleeding at the injection site in the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes with time in median and mean haematology or clinical 
chemistry values in either of the treatment groups and no apparent differences between the treatment 
groups. 
The proportion of patients reporting an abnormal haematology parameter at their treatment 
discontinuation visit was 31.8% in the fulvestrant 500 mg group compared to 30.2% in the fulvestrant 
250 mg group. 
The proportion of patients reporting an abnormal clinical chemistry parameter at baseline was 57.6% 
in the fulvestrant 500 mg group and 58.8% in the fulvestrant 250 mg group, compared with 67.4% 
and 57.7%, respectively, at treatment discontinuation.

Safety in special populations 
Patients ≥ 75 years of age 
Pooled data from CONFIRM, FINDER1, FINDER2, and NEWEST together comprising 560 patients in the 
500 mg group and 567 in the 250 mg group. The subgroups of patients ≥ 75 years of age comprised 
81 and 96 patients, respectively. 
In an analysis of patients who had at least 1 AE by system organ class, higher frequencies of the 
following AEs were seen in the 500 mg vs. the 250 mg group in the patients aged ≥ 75 years: General 
disorders and injection site conditions (46% vs. 33%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (15% vs. 
4%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (17% vs. 11,5%), injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (17% vs. 9%), ear and labyrinth disorders (5% vs.2 %). There was no difference 
between treatment groups with regard to cardiac disorders (5% in both). 
In an analysis of AEs according to MedDRA preferred terms present in ≥ 5% of the patients, higher 
frequencies of the following AEs were seen in the 500 mg vs. the 250 mg group in the patients aged ≥ 
75 years: Fatigue (17% vs. 8%), injection site pain (12% vs. 4%), diarrhoea (9% vs. 3%). On the 
other hand, the following AEs were more common in the 250 mg group: vomiting, asthenia, back pain 
and arthralgia. Fatigue and injection site pain were also markedly higher in the 500 mg vs. 250 mg 
group in the 65-74 year age group.  
Safety by race  
A pooled safety analysis of the studies named above divided patients into one of three racial groups: 
Caucasian (n=974), Oriental (n=99), and Black (n=11).  Vascular disorders and cardiac disorders 
(SOC) appeared in a higher frequency in black patients compared with the other races, however the 
absolute numbers are low (n= 1-2). The frequencies of vascular disorders in the combined racial 
groups were 14% in the 500 mg group vs. 16% in the 250 mg group, and the corresponding figures 
for cardiac disorders were 3% in both groups. Oriental patients reported overall more AEs than the 
other race groups, including (SOC): general disorders and administration site conditions, 
gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders. Nasopharyngitis (MedDRA 
PT ≥ 5%) was reported in oriental patients in 33 and 34% in the 500 mg and 250 mg groups, 
respectively, and not at all (i.e. <5%) in the other race groups. 
There was a consistency between the Caucasian and Oriental groups in the most common AEs (SOC) 
being: general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and infections and infestations. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The distribution of AEs was well balanced between treatment groups. The average number of AEs was 
3 per patient in both groups, approximately 20 % were judged causally related (22 and 20 % in the 
500 mg and 250 mg arms, respectively), approximately 10 % of the patients experienced SAEs (11 
and 9%, respectively) and only one patient in each group had a causally related SAE. The number of 
patients with AEs of CTC (Common toxicity criteria) grade 3 or higher, and with outcome of death were 
very similar. One patient died in a causally related AE in the 250 mg group. In addition, no clinically 
meaningful differences in discontinuations were seen between treatment groups. 
In conclusion the data presented gave no evidence of dose-dependent AEs. Specifically, there were no 
increases in the two most common areas of AE, GI disturbances and joint disorders, or in 
thromboembolic events with the higher dose regimen.

Based primarily on data from the CONFIRM study the MAH requested to remove venous 
thromboembolism from the precautions for use and the list of adverse drug reactions in the SmPC 
sections 4.4. and 4.8 and PL section 2, however the request could not be accepted based on available 
data as the MAH has not been able to prove or make plausible the absence of a causal relationship in a 
situation where potential mechanisms for the ADR exists. 
The request to remove a potential risk of osteoporosis from the SmPC was not accepted due to the fact 
that although bone turn-over markers in the NEWEST study were unaffected by 16 weeks of treatment 
with fulvestrant, the ability of the bone turn-over marker study to detect long-term effects on bone 
was questioned and it was not considered sufficient evidence. 
The CHMP considered that bleeding at the injection site is an important identified risk. In addition to 
the existing warnings in the Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding patients with bleeding diatheses, 
thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment; the CHMP considered necessary to include 
‘injection site haemorrhage and haematoma’ (frequency “uncommon”) in the table of adverse reactions 
in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Changes to the Product Information 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC 
The CHMP considered that bleeding at the injection site is an important identified risk and the MAH was 
requested to include ‘injection site haemorrhage and haematoma’ (frequency category “uncommon”) in 
the table of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC 
The request to include information on patients who have failed on prior anti-estrogen and aromatase 
inhibitor therapy from the CONFIRM in section 5.1 of the SmPC was agreed as the information can be 
helpful for the prescriber.

Faslodex is indicated in patients whose disease had recurred or progressed on an anti-estrogen therapy. The 
results in the AI subgroup are inconclusive. 
ORR was assessed in patients who were evaluable for response at baseline (ie, those with measurable disease 
at baseline: 240 patients in the Faslodex 500 mg group and 261 patients in the Faslodex 250 mg group). 
Patients with a best objective response of complete response, partial response or stable disease ≥24 weeks.

In addition the term “time to progression (TTP)” has been replaced by “progression free survival (PFS)” 
as TTP defined in the protocol refers by definition to PFS. 
Furthermore, the addition of data relating to mechanism of action (i.e. effects on proliferation marker 
Ki67 and the estrogen receptor) and effects on bone and endometrium in Section 5.1 of the SmPC was 
considered acceptable. 
Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC 
Major findings in the toxicological studies, especially findings such as vasculitis and arteritis in dogs 
and effects on pituitary in rats, were re-assessed in relation to the exposure. As a result, arteritis has 
been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly in line with the SmPC. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  SmPC,  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet  to  bring  them  in  line  with  the 
current QRD template. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has been revised to amend contact 
details for the representative of Czech Republic. 
Annex II has been updated in order to reflect the latest version of the RMP agreed. 
2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit for fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to aromatase inhibitors has not been 
demonstrated. No statistically significant effect has been observed with fulvestrant 500 mg vs. 250 mg 
in TTP in the subgroup of subjects who had used an aromatase inhibitor as last endocrine therapy in 
the pivotal Phase III CONFIRM study (TTP 250 mg 4.1 mo vs. TTP 500 mg 5.4 mo; HR=0.85 (CI 95% 
0.67-1.08, p=0.195). In line with the TTP results, there is a trend for a better survival in patients 
treated with fulvestrant 500 mg compared with the 250 mg group, however it was not statistically 
significant. 
Although secondary endpoints have shown some activity for fulvestrant in terms of overall response 
rate (ORR) for the 500 mg (7.3%) and the 250 mg (8.3%) doses and clinical benefit (CBR) for the 500

mg (36.2%) and the 250 mg (32.3%) dose, they were not considered firm evidence of a clinically 
meaningful benefit in the subgroup of subjects who had used an aromatase inhibitor as last endocrine 
therapy in the CONFIRM study.  In addition supportive phase II studies comparing fulvestrant 500 mg 
vs 250 mg (FINDER1 and FINDER2) have not shown statistically signifficant difference in ORR or CBR 
between the two treatment arms. 
One of the major drawbacks of the pivotal study CONFIRM was the fact that lack of adequate control 
(placebo) made it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant in subjects with AI as last endocrine 
therapy. A trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose was not considered sufficient and there 
was not enough evidence to justify why fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg should be regarded as 
efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
Some imbalances were also observed at baseline between the endocrine subgroups (prior AI vs. prior 
AO as last endocrine therapy) regarding the number of prior (endocrine) treatments, the disease 
setting (adjuvant vs advanced) and age. These imbalances may partly explain the differences in 
activity of fulvestrant in the endocrine subgroups. In addition it made extrapolation between the two 
subgroups difficult. On the other hand, no mechanistic or other reasons were put forward in order to 
support the notion that the efficacy shown in the AO group would provide support in the interpretation 
of the results in the AI group. 
In terms of toxicity the distribution of AEs was well balanced between treatment groups. The average 
number of AEs was 3 per patient in both groups, approximately 20 % were judged causally related (22 
and 20 % in the 500 mg and 250 mg arms, respectively), approximately 10 % of the patients 
experienced SAEs (11 and 9%, respectively) and only one patient in each group had a causally related 
SAE. The number of patients with AEs of CTC grade 3 or higher, and with outcome of death were very 
similar. There were no increases in the two most common areas of AE, GI disturbances and joint 
disorders, nor in thromboembolic events with the higher dose regimen. In conclusion there is not 
additional toxicity associated with the 500 mg dose of fulvestrant compared to the lower 250 mg dose. 
As per CHMP request, an oncology Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting was convened on 16 June 
2010 to discuss the benefits of fulvestrant from a clinical perspective and whether fulvestrant at a dose 
of 250 mg should be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. The SAG 
provided advice on the following questions raised by the Committee: 
1. While some activity in terms of overall response rate (8%) has been shown for 
fulvestrant 250 mg, efficacy (=clinically meaningful activity) cannot be deduced. Therefore 
it is not sufficient only to demonstrate a trend towards higher efficacy for the 500 mg dose 
(HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67; 1.08). The sponsor is thus asked to justify why fulvestrant at a dose 
of 250 mg should be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor therapy. 
The SAG agreed by consensus that insufficient evidence of efficacy has been presented to establish 
that fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg can be regarded as efficacious in patients with disease 
progression after aromatase inhibitors. The CONFIRM trial was not designed to address this question 
and only indirect comparisons can be made. The efficacy results for fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg do 
not show any dramatic activity in terms of response rate, PFS or any of the clinical outcomes presented 
and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn from indirect comparisons. Thus, it is unknown if 
fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg can be regarded as efficacious in patients failing aromatase inhibitor 
therapy.  
The SAG agreed that formal evidence of efficacy should be provided according to rigorous scientific 
standards to establish the efficacy of fulvestrant in patients with disease progression after aromatase 
inhibitors. The best way to address this question is through randomised controlled trials.

Nevertheless, some SAG members argued that in view of the manageable toxicity profile, fulvestrant 
could be regarded as a possible option in this setting but this is not based on firm evidence, rather, on 
clinical expert judgement of exploratory analyses suggesting some antitumour activity. The level of 
evidence to support this currently does not fulfil conventional scientific standards, prompting the need 
for confirmatory studies. 
2. Please discuss the relevance of the evidence of efficacy demonstrated in patients failing 
anti-estrogens to patients failing aromatase inhibitors. 
Currently, there is no strong pharmacologic rationale to assume that tumour characteristics would be 
substantially different in patients with disease progression after aromatase inhibitors compared to 
patients who progressed upon anti-estrogen therapy. However, there is also no strong rationale to 
exclude that such differences exist. One would need to confirm this through adequate clinical trials.  
Concerning the CONFIRM trial, there are substantial differences between the two populations in terms 
of patient and disease characteristics (e.g., demographics, prior treatment) to make an extrapolation 
difficult.  
3. Considering the points discussed above, the MAH is requested to review existing data on 
the efficacy and safety of available alternative treatment options (including chemotherapy) 
after failure with AIs and to discuss those findings in relation to the observed effects with 
fulvestrant in subjects after failure with AI in CONFIRM study. 
The efficacy results for fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg do not show any dramatic activity in terms of 
response rate, PFS or any of the clinical outcomes presented and therefore no firm conclusions can be 
drawn from direct or indirect comparisons with other treatment options. Based on the exploratory 
analyses presented, some antitumour activity has been observed but it is unknown to what extent this 
would result in a meaningful clinical benefit or how this would compare to relevant treatment options 
including “gentle” chemotherapy. 
The CHMP considered the data submitted and the argumentation put forward by the applicant and the 
SAG experts. Based on the above findings, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance for 
fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to aromatase inhibitors was not favourable and that the 
therapeutic efficacy has not been properly and sufficiently demonstrated in order to support the 
extension of the current approved indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC . However the CHMP 
considered acceptable the inclusion of relevant data on patients who have failed on prior anti-estrogen 
and aromatase inhibitor therapy by subgroup in section 5.1 of the SmPC as the information can be 
helpful for the prescriber.

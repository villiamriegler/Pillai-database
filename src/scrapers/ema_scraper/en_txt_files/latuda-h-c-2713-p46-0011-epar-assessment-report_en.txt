Introduction 
On 14 May, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Latuda® (lurasidone), in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Latuda® was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults in EU in 21st March 2014. 
Currently  Latuda®  has  no  paediatric  indication.  The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study 
does not influence the benefit risk for Latuda® and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
This is the first of four agreed studies in the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMEA-001230-PIP01-
11-M01) for the treatment of schizophrenia with lurasidone.  
The studies in the pediatric clinical program are: 
PK  study  (D1050300):  An  open-label,  multicenter,  single  and  multiple  fixed-dose  study  to 
- 
evaluate  PK,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  lurasidone  in  adolescent  subjects  (6  to  <18  years  old)  with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders. This study 
is now complete. 
Short-term  efficacy  and  safety  study  (D1050301):  A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
- 
controlled,  multicenter,  6-week,  fixed-dose,  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
lurasidone in adolescent subjects (13 to <18 years old) with schizophrenia. This study is on-going. 
Long-term  extension  study  (D1050302):  A  2-year,  open-label  extension  to  D1050301, 
- 
multicenter,  flexible-dose  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  lurasidone  in 
adolescent subjects (13 to <18 years old) with schizophrenia. This study is on-going. 
- 
Maintenance  study  (5474):  A  26-week,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  multicenter,  flexible-
dose clinical study to evaluate the maintenance of the efficacy and safety of lurasidone compared with 
aripiprazole in adolescent subjects (13 to <18 years old) with schizophrenia. This study is planned to 
begin enrolling in 2015. 
According to the updated PIP (October 2013), it should be completed by April 2018.  
Additional  clarification  was  requested  14th  July,  2014  (see  Section  4)  and  the  MAH 
responses  are  assessed  in  the  present  report  (see  Section  5),  including  a  new  overall 
conclusion (see Section 6).

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
There is no paediatric indication for Latuda and no specific paediatric formulation is available. In the 
paediatric study the following formulations were administered: 
20  mg  film-coated  tablets  (Lot  Number  69731E0)  and  40  mg  film-coated  tablets  (Lot  Number 
69731F0)  of  lurasidone  hydrochloride  (18.5  mg  and  37  mg  lurasidone,  respectively)  supplied  by 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.  1. Introduction 
Lurasidone is a new chemical entity belonging to the chemical class of piperidinyl-benzisoxazole 
derivatives. It has high affinity for dopamine D2- and serotonergic 5HT2A- and 5-HT7-receptors. It 
also inhibits α2c-adrenergic receptor and α2a-adrenergic receptors and also exhibits some partial 
agonistic effect at the 5HT1A receptor. 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
-  D1050300 
1.4.  2. Clinical study 
D1050300: A PHASE 1 OPEN-LABEL, MULTICENTER, SINGLE AND MULTIPLE-ASCENDING DOSE STUDY 
TO EVALUATE PHARMACOKINETICS, SAFETY, AND TOLERABILITY OF LURASIDONE IN SUBJECTS 6 TO 
17 YEARS OLD WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM, BIPOLAR SPECTRUM, AUTISTIC SPECTRUM 
DISORDER, OR OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 
  Description 
This was a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of single and 
multiple-dose lurasidone tablet administration in children and adolescent subjects 6 to 17 years of age 
with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum, autistic spectrum disorder, or other psychiatric 
disorders. 
  Methods 
•  Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was to characterize the PK and assess safety and tolerability of single and 
multiple oral doses of 20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day lurasidone in subjects 6 to 17 years old with 
schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum, autistic spectrum disorder, or other psychiatric disorders. 
Secondary Objective 
The secondary objective was to characterize the PK for metabolites of lurasidone (ID-14283, ID-14326, 
ID-11614, ID-20219, and ID-20220) following single and multiple oral doses of 20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 
mg/day lurasidone in subjects 6 to 17 years old with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum, 
autistic spectrum disorder, or other psychiatric disorders. 
•  Study design 
Sequential escalating doses of lurasidone (20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day) were administered to 4 
age groups (6 to 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, and 16 to 17 years) of subjects. All subjects received a single 
dose of lurasidone followed by a 2-day washout period, then once-daily dosing of lurasidone for 7 days 
(20 mg through 120 mg cohorts) or 9 days (160 mg cohort). 
•  Study population /Sample size

Male or female subjects 6 to 17 years of age, inclusive. Approximately 100 subjects were planned to be 
enrolled to obtain 80 completed subjects in the 4 age groups. To reach 20 completed subjects per age 
group (i.e., 4 subjects/age group/dose level x 5 doses), clinical sites were to collectively enrol 
approximately 25 subjects per age group. 
Subjects with the following diagnoses were eligible for participation: primary schizophrenia spectrum 
diagnosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, schizophreniform, or psychotic disorder Not Otherwise 
Specified [NOS]), bipolar spectrum disorder (bipolar I, II, or bipolar NOS), PDD including autistic 
spectrum disorder (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, or PDD-NOS), ADHD with aggressive 
behavior (meeting co-morbid diagnostic criteria for Conduct Disorder/Disruptive Behavior Disorders 
[CD/DBD-NOS]), or Tourette’s syndrome, via clinical interview (using MINI-Kid and diagnostic 
interview and the DSM-IV-TR as a reference). Autistic disorder was also confirmed by the ADI-R. 
Subjects were tapered off their psychotropic medications as outpatients with the last dose of these 
medications taken no later than Day -3, if, in the investigator’s opinion, the subject was not at risk for 
worsening symptoms. Subjects resumed psychiatric medication treatment, per the investigator’s 
discretion after collection of the last PK sample and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
assessment on Day 11 or Day 13. 
Subjects who had used of any inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) taken within 28 
days prior to drug administration and until discharge on Day 11 (20 to 120 mg cohorts) or Day 13 (160 
mg cohort) were excluded. Exceptions (e.g., for grapefruit juice consumption) could be discussed on a 
case-by-case basis with the medical monitor. 
• 
Treatments 
All subjects received a single dose of lurasidone followed by a 2-day washout period, then once-daily 
dosing of lurasidone for 7 days (20 mg through 120 mg cohorts) or 9 days (160 mg cohort). 
For the 120 mg cohort, the following doses were used: Day 1, 80 mg; Days 4 to 5, 80 mg; and Days 6 
to 10, 120 mg. For the 160 mg cohort, the following doses were used: Day 1, 80 mg; Days 4 to 5, 80 
mg; Days 6 to 7, 120 mg; and Days 8 to 12, 160 mg 
Breakfast (minimum of 350 calories) was given 30 minutes prior to the planned dosing time. Study 
drug was administered to 6- to 12-year-old subjects with approximately 180 mL of room temperature 
water and to 13- to 17-year-old subjects with approximately 240 mL. No fluid intake was permitted for 
2 hours after dose administration; after which fluids were allowed ad libitum. No food was allowed for 
at least 4 hours after dosing. Total daily calorie intake was not to exceed 3000 calories. 
•  Analytical methods 
Serum samples were measured for the concentrations of lurasidone and its 3 metabolites (ID-14283, 
ID 14326, and ID-11614) using a validated LC-MS/MS method (Covance report number 8249-822). 
Serum samples were also analyzed for the concentrations of the other 2 metabolites (ID 20219 and 
ID-20220) using a separate validated LC-MS/MS method (Covance report number 7589-156). 
The linear range for lurasidone was 0.100 to 100 ng/mL with the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 
0.100 ng/mL. The linear range for each of metabolites ID-14283, ID-14326, and ID-11614 was 0.0500 
to 50.0 ng/mL with the LLOQ of 0.0500 ng/mL. The linear range for each of the metabolites ID-20219 
and ID-20220 was 0.500 to 500 ng/mL with the LLOQ of 0.500 ng/mL.  
In this sample analysis study, for the measurement of lurasidone and its metabolites ID-14283, ID 
14326, and ID-11614 concentrations, overall assay precision (relative standard deviation [RSD%] of 
quality control samples) was in the range of 4.9 to 9.4%, and accuracy (RE%) was in the range of -5.5 
to 1.5%; for the measurement of other 2 metabolites ID-20219 and ID-20220 concentrations, overall 
assay precision (RSD% of quality control samples) was 4.3 to 8.6%, and accuracy (RE%) was -1.1 to 
2.4%. 
Assessor´s comment: 
It is stated that the plasma concentration were determined with validated methods, however 
bioanalytical reports are missing. The pre-study validation and the within study validation (analysis of 
Page 4/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the study samples) reports should be provided and the Guideline on the bioanalytical method 
validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) should be fulfilled. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic assessments for serum lurasidone and its metabolite concentrations (ID-4283, ID-
14326, ID-11614, ID-20219, and ID-20220) included the following: 48 hour serial blood sampling 
following Day 1 dose administration and 24 hour serial blood sampling following Day 10 (or Day 12) 
dose administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using non-compartmental methods.  
Adverse event reporting began at the time of signed informed consent and continued until study 
completion (follow-up). All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Out of range clinical laboratory, 12-lead ECG, vital sign, or physical examination findings 
considered clinically significant by the investigator were reported as an AE as outlined below. 
Spontaneous AE reporting, including extrapyramidal side effects or symptoms (EPS) assessments was 
reported. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetics: Descriptive statistics were performed to summarize the data by dose level and by 
age group in tabular and graphical formats. Lurasidone Cmax, AUClast, and AUC(0–∞) (Day 1); and 
Cmax and AUC0–24 (Day 10 or Day 12) were considered the primary PK parameters. 
Safety: Safety data were listed and summarized descriptively by dose cohort/level and age group in 
tabular format. Change from baseline was calculated for selected endpoints (clinical laboratory data, 
vital signs, ECGs, BAS, SAS, AIMS, and CGI-S). 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 105 subjects (6 to 9 years, 20 subjects; 10 to 12 years, 29 subjects; 13 to 15 years, 31 
subjects; and 16 to 17 years, 25 subjects) were enrolled into the study and included in the safety 
population (i.e., received at least 1 dose of study drug), and 102 subjects were included in the PK 
population. 
•  Baseline data 
A total of 68 male (64.8%) and 37 female (35.2%) subjects were included in the safety population of 
the study. The ratio of male to female subjects was comparable between the dose cohorts. Mean age 
was comparable between dose cohorts and was 12.7 years.

Efficacy results 
This was an open-label PK study and thus no efficacy results were obtained. Pharmacokinetics and 
tolerability were evaluated.  There were 102 subjects in the PK analysis set. At day 1, seven subjects 
were excluded and at last day of dosing 19 were excluded from PK parameters. Most common reasons 
for exclusion were vomiting or early termination from the study.  
Assessor´s comment: 
The reasons for exclusion are acceptable in all cases except for subject 300013355. For this subject 
“An abnormal PK profile on day 10” was given as reason for exclusion. This is not acceptable and the 
MAH needs to discuss the PK of this subject. No profile is submitted for this subject and it is important 
to understand if it was unusually high or low exposure and if so the possible underlying reasons. 
It is noted that a majority of study population had a diagnosis of ADHD with conduct disorder. 
However, in the adult population there was no difference in exposure between healthy volunteers 
compared to schizophrenic patients.   
In this study PK parameters were determined for lurasidone and its metabolites, ID-14283 (minor 
active), ID-14326 (minor active), ID-11614 (inactive), ID-20219 (major inactive), and ID-20220 
(major inactive). Plasma profiles of lurasidone and one of its active metabolites (ID-14283) are 
presented in Figure 1 below. In Appendix 1 the exposure of lurasidone at last day of dosing in each 
dose and age group is given.

Table 2.  Summary of Lurasidone Key Pharmacokinetics Parameters for    All Age Groups 
on Day 10 (or Day 12 for 160 mg) 
Following the single lurasidone dose on Day 1, mean PK exposure (AUC0-∞, AUClast, and Cmax) for all 
age groups combined increased with dose from 20 to 80 mg. Median tmax was independent of dose 
and was observed at 2 hours post-dose. Mean t½ was similar and ranged from 16.2 to 21.3 hours 
across all 3 dose groups. Mean CL/F and Vz/F values of lurasidone were similar across all dose groups 
and ranged from 317 to 346 L/h and 6940 to 8700 L for CL/F and Vz/F, respectively.  
Following multiple lurasidone doses on last day of dosing, mean PK exposure (AUC0-24 and Cmax) for 
all age groups combined increased with dose from 20 to 160 mg. Median tmax appeared independent 
of dose and was observed between 1 and 2 hours across the 5 dose groups. Mean CL/F values of 
lurasidone were similar across all dose groups and ranged from 256 to 323 L/h. Some accumulation 
was observed following 10 days of dosing. Mean RAUC0-24 and RCmax appeared to be independent of 
dose over the dose range of 20 to 80 mg and ranged from 1.30 to 1.66 and from 1.16 to 1.40, 
respectively (Table 2).  
Page 8/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As indicated in Table 3 by the point estimates and 95% CIs of the slope estimates, AUC0-24 of 
lurasidone on Day 10 or 12 increased approximately dose proportionally over the dose range of 20 to 
160 mg while Cmax of lurasidone increased less than dose proportionally. 
Table 3.  Assessment of Dose Proportionality for Lurasidone Serum Pharmacokinetic 
Parameters Following Multiple Doses on Day 10 (or Day 12) 
The effects of age, weight, and BSA on lurasidone PK parameters were evaluated graphically. 
Individual lurasidone dose-normalized Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-∞ on Day 1, and dose-normalized 
Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 10 or 12 appeared to decrease with the increase of age (from 6 to 17 
years), weight (from 19.4 to 86 kg), or BSA (from 0.79 to 2.09 m2). Consistently, individual lurasidone 
CL/F on Day 1 and Day 10 or 12 appeared to increase with the increase of age (from 6 to 17 years), 
weight (from 19.4 to 86 kg), or BSA (from 0.79 to 2.09 m2).  Figures 2 and 3 shows AUC(0-24) and 
Cmax vs. age on last day of dosing, respectively. In Figures 4 and 5 the CL/F vs. age and body weight 
are given. No further statistical analysis was planned or performed for the relationship between age, 
weight, or BSA and lurasidone PK parameters due to the exploratory nature of this study.

Adult exposure 
The MAH states that the observed lurasidone paediatric PK exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24) following 
multiple dose administration, in subjects age 6 to 17 years, across the daily dose range studied (20 to 
160 mg) were generally similar to adult exposures previously observed at steady state (source: 
M1050005). However, the MAH did not supply the adult data referred to.  
Assessor´s comment: 
Several metabolites were determined and PK parameters were calculated. The active metabolite ID-
14283 contributed to ca. 30% of parent exposure at steady state. This is similar to the found 
metabolite ratio found in adult population. The importance of the other metabolites has been shown to 
Page 11/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be minor (Latuda EPAR – Public Assessment Report, Report date 08 April 2014) and is therefore not 
further assessed.   
For lurasidone, the AUC(0-24) at last day of dosing increased approximately in proportion to dose 
while Cmax increased less than dose proportionally. There was no unexpected accumulation of 
lurasidone after multiple dosing. 
It is agreed that CL/F appears to increase with increasing age and weight in the paediatric population. 
However, to better utilize the full data, PK modelling is encouraged for future submissions. This may 
facilitate assessment and also enable extrapolation of data.     
The MAH states that the exposure is in general similar between paediatrics and adults. However, no 
data was presented to support this statement. The MAH should compile relevant exposure data and 
justify the choice of adult data used for comparison with paediatric data. In addition, if a difference in 
exposure is established between adults and paediatrics the MAH should aim to explain the possible 
underlying differences.         
•  Safety results 
In Study D1050300, the most frequently observed AEs (≥10%) across the dose range in pediatric 
subjects were somnolence (42%), sedation (18%), nausea (17%), and vomiting (15%). The incidence 
of movement disorder AEs was 2.0% for akathisia and 1.0% for Parkinsonism. This pattern was 
consistent across all age groups. 
All subjects in the 120 mg dose cohort in the 6 to 9 years age group experienced mild to moderate 
sedation or somnolence. The Cohort Review Team (CRT) therefore recommended not to dose escalate 
to 160 mg, despite not formally meeting the stopping rule, due to the negative impact this AE may 
have had on daily function. 
The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were dose-related with the highest 
overall adverse event frequency observed in the 160 mg dose cohort. TEAEs were reported for 4 
subjects (4/20, 20.0%) in the 20 mg cohort, 17 subjects (17/25, 68.0%) in the 40 mg cohort, 17 
subjects (17/19, 89.5%) in the 80 mg cohort, 24 subjects (24/25, 96.0%) in the 120 mg cohort 
(includes 80 and 120 mg doses combined), and 16 subjects (16/16, 100%) in the 160 mg cohort 
(includes 80, 120, and 160 mg doses combined). In the 120 and 160 mg dosing schemes, in most 
cases, somnolence and sedation were initially observed at the 80 mg dose administered on Days 1, 4, 
and 5 of those schemes, but continued to be observed throughout administration of the 120 mg or 120 
mg/160 mg doses. Most TEAEs of nausea, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting reported at the 120 and 
160 mg dosing schemes began during the 80 mg dose administered on Days 1, 4, and 5. 
Across all age groups and dose cohorts/levels, 5 of 105 subjects (4.8%) experienced TEAEs assessed 
by the investigator as severe. All other TEAEs were assessed as mild (22/105, 21.0%) or moderate 
(51/105, 48.6%) in severity. 
Most TEAEs resolved for the majority of subjects, while 5 subjects (all TEAEs of somnolence) recovered 
with sequelae and 1 subject (TEAE of streptococcal pharyngitis) was recovering at the time of 
reporting. In the 5 subjects with TEAEs of somnolence, the duration of somnolence lasted between a 
few hours to 1 day after the event onset for 4 subjects. In the remaining subject, there was 1 TEAE of 
somnolence that lasted a maximum of 2 days. 
A total of 2 serious adverse events (SAEs), parkinsonism (subject withdrawn due to SAE) and 
dystonia (with hospitalization, subject withdrawn due to sponsor decision), were reported and were 
assessed by the investigators as related to study drug.  
Nine subjects were withdrawn from the study due to TEAEs: 1 subject with parkinsonism (SAE), 
somnolence (2 subjects), blurred vision (1 subject), dystonia (1 subject), vomiting (3 subjects), and 
akathisia (1 subject); all events were assessed by the investigators as possibly, probably, or related to 
study drug. There were no deaths during the study. 
Of the 9 subjects aged 6 to 17 years who discontinued due to an AE, the majority (n=6) were treated 
with lurasidone doses ≥80 mg/day. The remaining 3 subjects discontinued at a dose of 40 mg/day. Six 
subjects aged between 6 to 12 years discontinued due to AEs (2 subjects at 40 mg, 3 subjects at 80 
Page 12/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mg, and 1 subject at 120 mg [dose at onset]) and 3 subjects (1 at 40 mg and 2 at 80 mg [dose at 
onset]) aged between 13 and 17 years. 
At screening, three (2.9 %) subjects reported a history of suicidal behavior and 10 (9.5 %)reported a 
history of suicidal ideation at the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale lifetime assessment, but no 
suicidality or suicidal ideation was detected during the study in any subject. 
No clinically significant changes in laboratory tests (with the exception of prolactin elevation), vital sign 
measurements, or electrocardiogram findings were observed.  
Assessors comment:  
The types of the most frequently observed AEs in study D1050300 were similar to those reported in 
adults. However, across the dose range in pediatric subjects, the frequencies for some AEs were higher 
than has been reported in previous short-term placebo-controlled studies in adults (including 
somnolence, sedation, nausea, vomiting).  There were no new or unexpected AEs reported.  The 
lowest doses 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day were better tolerated than the 80 mg dose. Of the 9 subjects 
aged 6-17 years who discontinued due to an AE, the majority (n=6) were treated with lurasidone 
doses ≥ 80 mg/day. In the lowest age group 6-9 years, tolerability issues (moderate or severe 
vomiting, sedation and somnolence) were seen with the 120 mg/day dose and doses greater than 120 
mg were therefore not evaluated in this age group. Taking these results for the lowest age group into 
account, it might be necessary to consider a lower maximum dose for younger children in the pediatric 
population than in adults. 
2.  Rapporteur’s initial overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Overall conclusion 
The present study includes rich PK data in the paediatric population (6-17 years), but an adequate 
comparison to exposure in adults has not been presented. The MAH should compile and provide 
relevant adult exposure data and further compare with exposure in the paediatric population. The PIP 
is planned to be fulfilled in 2018, meanwhile it is considered relevant to update SmPC section 5.2 with 
paediatric exposure data. 
  Recommendation  
Before a final assessment of the study the MAH should respond to list of additional clarification in 
section IV. The MAH should propose a SmPC wording (Section 5.2) after a comparison to adult 
exposure data has been performed. An update of SmPC section 5.2 (and standard text in section 4.2 
according to SmPC guideline) to include the paediatric data is recommended as a variation after 
completion of this procedure.  
  Fulfilled –  
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications as part of this procedure 
(see section 4 “Additional clarifications requested”).

3.  ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED 
1.  It is stated that the plasma concentration were determined with validated methods, however 
bioanalytical reports are missing. The pre-study validation and the within study validation 
(analysis of the study samples) reports should be provided and the Guideline on the 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) should be fulfilled. 
2.  The reasons for exclusion in the PK data set are acceptable in all cases except for subject 
300013355. For this subject “An abnormal PK profile on day 10” was given as reason for 
exclusion. This is not acceptable and the MAH needs to discuss the PK of this subject or 
motivate whether the profile is implausible. It is important to understand if the exposure was 
unusually high or low and if so the possible underlying mechanistic reason. 
3.  The MAH states that the exposure is in general similar between paediatrics and adults. 
However, no data was presented to support this statement. The MAH should compile relevant 
adult exposure data and justify the choice of adult data used for comparison. In addition, if a 
difference in exposure is established between adult and paediatric population the MAH should 
aim to explain the possible underlying differences. 
4.  Based on the response on Question 3, a SmPC text in Section 5.2 regarding exposure in the 
paediatric population should be suggested by MAH.

4.  Assessment of the responses to the List of Questions 
Question 1  
It is stated that the plasma concentration were determined with validated methods, however 
bioanalytical reports are missing. The pre-study validation and the within study validation (analysis of 
the study samples) reports should be provided and the Guideline on the bioanalytical method 
validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) should be fulfilled. 
RESPONSE 
The prestudy validation and within study validation sample analysis reports used to support Study 
D1050300 are attached (refer to Validation Report 8249-822, Validation Report 8249-822 Addendum I 
and Addendum II, Validation Report 7589-156, Validation Report 7589-156 Addendum I and 
Addendum II, and Bioanalytical Sample Analysis Report 8249-944). 
The objective of Study 8249-822 was to validate a method for the determination of lurasidone (SM-
13496) and its metabolites (ID-14283, ID-14326, and ID-11614) in human serum by high-
performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. The sample extraction 
procedure and chromatographic conditions were very similar to those employed in the previously 
validated method Report 8200-092. The major modification from the 8200-092 method was the 
calibration curve range for each analyte. Reports 8249-822 Addendum I and II included extension of 
the stability period of the compounds in frozen matrix. 
The objective of Study 7589-156 was to validate a method for the determination of lurasidone 
metabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220) in human serum by high-performance liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Validation Report 7589-156 Addendum I and II included 
extension of the stability period of the compounds in frozen matrix. 
Analysis Report 8249-944 presented the analysis of samples from Study D1050300 for lurasidone and 
its metabolites ID-14283, ID-14326 and ID 11614 using the method validated in 8249-822 and for 
metabolites ID-20219 and ID-20220 using the method validated in 7589-156. A total of 1792 serum 
samples were successfully analyzed for lurasidone, ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-11614, ID-20219, and ID-
20220. Incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) was evaluated. The ISR results were acceptable (within 
20.0% of each other) for all analyzed with the respective pass rate for lurasidone (96%), ID-14283 
(94%), ID-14326 (89%), ID-11614 (96%), ID-20219 (99%), and ID-20220 (98%). 
All study samples were analyzed within the known stability period of 744 days for SM-13496, ID-
14283, ID-14326, and ID-11614 and 1373 days for ID-20219 and ID-20220 when stored at - 10°C to 
-30°C. 
The method validation and sample analysis reports are considered adequate to fulfill the criteria 
required by the guideline on bioanalytical method validation (1) and are presented for Agency review. 
Assessor’s comment:  
The bioanalytical pre-study validation and within-study validation reports were submitted and 
performance of the analytical method was satisfactory.   
Issue resolved 
Question 2  
The reasons for exclusion in the PK data set are acceptable in all cases except for subject 300013355. 
For this subject “An abnormal PK profile on day 10” was given as reason for exclusion. This is not 
acceptable and the MAH needs to discuss the PK of this subject or motivate whether the profile is 
implausible. It is important to understand if the exposure was unusually high or low and if so the 
possible underlying mechanistic reason. 
RESPONSE 
Subject 300013355 was excluded from the pharmacokinetic data set because lurasidone exposure on 
Day 10 was unusually low, and this was most likely due to noncompliance with lurasidone 
Page 15/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration. To respond to this question, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has reviewed 
the study design, demographic data, dosing records, and sample analyses records of Subject 
300013355, who was scheduled to receive lurasidone at a dose of 80mg. In addition to these other 
reviews, the plasma concentration-time profiles on Day 1 and Day 10 for Subject 300013355 were 
compared with the mean plasma concentration-time profiles for all subjects in the 80 mg lurasidone 
cohort. Following the review of this information, the MAH has concluded that the most probable reason 
for the difference in the pharmacokinetic profile on Day 1 and Day 10 in this subject is due to 
noncompliance with study medication during Days 4 to 10. 
In this study, it was planned that all subjects would receive a single dose of lurasidone on Day 1 
followed by a 2-day washout period (Days 2 and 3), then once-daily dosing of lurasidone for 7 days 
(Days 4 to 10). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 
4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours postdose on Day 1, as well as at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 
and 24 hours postdose on Day 10. 
The subject with an abnormal pharmacokinetic profile on Day 10 (Subject 300013355) was a 13-year-
old White male diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with conduct disorder 
(refer to Study D1050300, Listing 16.2.4.5), who weighed 63.6 kg with a height of 165 cm at 
Screening (Listing 16.2.4.2). 
Subject 300013355 reported taking study medication on Day 1 and Days 4 to 10 (Listing 16.2.5.1), 
generally within half an hour of eating breakfast (Listing 16.2.5.2), and returned only 1 of the 9 
tablets that were provided (Listing 16.2.5.1). With the exception of 2 administrations of lorazepam for 
the treatment of anxiety (0.5 mg on 2 occasions on Day 1 and 1 mg on Day 4), the subject did not 
receive any concomitant medications (Listing 16.2.4.12). The pharmacokinetic blood sample 
collections were also collected at the appropriately nominated time (Listing 16.2.6.1), and 
concentrations from Day 10 blood samples were verified in ISR (see Analysis Report 8249-944). 
On Day 1, the pharmacokinetic data for Subject 300013355 were similar to the mean data for the 80 
mg Cohort. However, an analysis of the plasma concentration levels found that Subject 300013355 
had low plasma concentrations of lurasidone on Day 10 (refer to Listing 16.2.6.2), and was 
subsequently excluded from the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analyses on Day 10. To address this 
question, the MAH has plotted the plasma concentration-time profile for Subject 300013355 (as shown 
in Figure 1), and calculated individual pharmacokinetic parameters for this subject (as shown in Table 
1).  
Figure 1: Lurasidone Plasma Concentration-time Profiles for Subject 300013355 Following 
Single (Day 1) and Multiple-Dose (Day 10) Administration of 80 mg Lurasidone in Study 
Table 1: Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Data for Subject 300013355 With the Mean Data 
for the 80 mg Cohort in D1050300 
Page 16/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in Figure 1, the subject had markedly lower lurasidone plasma concentration on Day 10 
versus Day 1. Table 1 indicates that although the Day 1 pharmacokinetic data for Subject 300013355 
were similar to the mean data for the 80 mg Cohort, the Day 10 data were markedly lower. 
Given that the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic profile of lurasidone on Day 1 were aligned 
with the group mean, the most likely reason for the low concentrations of lurasidone observed in this 
subject on Day 10 is noncompliance in taking study medication while the subject was an outpatient 
between Days 4 to 9, as well as on Day 10. Although the subject exhibited low concentrations of 
lurasidone on Day 10 (as shown in Figure 1), it could be expected that on Day 10 there would be 
residual systemic concentrations from dosing on Day 1 as lurasidone exhibits multi-compartmental 
pharmacokinetics with a long terminal elimination half-life (184 hours in adults). Therefore it would 
seem likely that the low concentrations of lurasidone observed on Day 10 for this subject are due to 
remaining concentrations from the Day 1 dose, and subsequent noncompliance with missed 
medication on Days 4 to 10. 
Based on the overall assessment, subject 300013355 was excluded from the pharmacokinetic 
analyses due to noncompliance. 
Assessor’s comment:  
The MAHs explanation for the abnormal PK profile in subject 300013355 was satisfactory and 
subsequent exclusion from PK analysis is acceptable.   
Issue resolved 
Question 3  
The MAH states that the exposure is in general similar between paediatrics and adults. However, no 
data was presented to support this statement. The MAH should compile relevant adult exposure data 
and justify the choice of adult data used for comparison. In addition, if a difference in exposure is 
established between adult and paediatric population the MAH should aim to explain the possible 
underlying differences. 
RESPONSE 
The pharmacokinetic exposure data to lurasidone in paediatric subjects generated from Study 
D1050300 was compared with pharmacokinetic exposure data generated from an adult population 
pharmacokinetic model (M1050011). This population model was developed using subjects with 
schizophrenia, subjects with bipolar depression, and healthy volunteers. This is an update to the 
previously submitted population pharmacokinetic model (Report M1050005) to include subjects with 
bipolar depression. This updated adult pharmacokinetic population model found that the 
pharmacokinetics of lurasidone was not affected by disease type as shown by a similar 
Page 17/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteers, as well as patients with schizophrenia or bipolar 
depression (M1050011). 
The results of this comparison of lurasidone in paediatric subjects generated from Study D1050300 
with the adult population pharmacokinetic model are shown in Figure 2 for area under the serum 
concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCss) and Figure 3 for Cmax. In these figures, pediatric 
data are represented by open circles, and the adult data (based on simulations from 5000 adult 
subjects using the adult population pharmacokinetic model), are represented using box plots. The 
solid line in the center of the box represents the median of the simulated adult values, while the 
bottom and top of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Simulated values 
outside the span of the lower and upper whiskers (outliers) are represented by open squares.

The observed steady-state paediatric lurasidone pharmacokinetic Cmax and area under the 
concentration-time curve following multiple-dose administration (for 7 days, from Day 4 to 10) across 
the dose range used (20 to 160 mg lurasidone), were generally within the simulated exposure ranges 
for the same dose range and durations in adults (see Table 2 and Table 3).

Study D1050300 was conducted in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan binding 
elements (ref: EMEA-001230-PIP01-M01) and the pediatric population (N=105) comprised of subjects 
with schizophrenia (n=4; 3.8%), schizoaffective disorder (n=1; 1.0%), ADHD with conduct 
disorder/disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified (n=78; 74.3% of patients), bipolar 
spectrum disorder (bipolar I) (n=16; 16.2%), bipolar spectrum disorder not otherwise specified (n=2; 
1.9%), pervasive developmental disorders/autistic spectrum disorder (n=1; 1.0%), or Tourette’s 
syndrome (n=2; 1.9%). The population used in the comparator adult population pharmacokinetic 
model (N=2077) was developed using data from healthy volunteers (n=131; 6.3%), as well as 
patients with schizophrenia (n=1492; 71.8%) or bipolar depression (n=454; 21.9%). There were no 
subjects with ADHD included in the adult model. 
As previously described in the adult population pharmacokinetic model, the pharmacokinetic profile 
was not affected by disease type (refer to Report M1050011). Therefore, the comparison with this 
adult model was deemed to be justified on the basis that it is not expected that disease diagnosis 
would alter the pharmacokinetic properties of lurasidone in pediatric subjects. 
On the basis of this comparison, the MAH have concluded that in general, the exposure is similar 
between pediatric and adult patients. 
Assessor’s comment:  
The population pharmacokinetic model in adults was submitted in the initial MAA and includes healthy 
volunteers, schizophrenia and patients with bipolar depression.  The pharmacokinetic profile was 
shown not to be affected by disease type in adults.  
It is therefore acceptable to compare the exposure to lurasidone in paediatric subjects with several 
different diagnoses with the simulated adult data from the popPK model.

It is agreed that the observed steady-state paediatric lurasidone pharmacokinetic Cmax and AUC 
across the dose range used (20 to 160 mg lurasidone), were generally within the simulated exposure 
ranges for the same dose range and durations in adults. Lurasidone is mainly eliminated via CYP3A4 
metabolism. The maturation of hepatic CYP3A4 is essentially complete at age 6, which support that 
exposure of lurasidone is similar in children and adolescents compared to adults. In addition, body 
weight has been found not to be a significant covariate in adults in the PopPK analysis.    
Although no formal statistical analysis was performed for the paediatic data no clear correlation of 
obtained exposure to age or weight could be detected in the dose-normalized exposure vs. age or 
weight plots.    
Issue resolved 
Question 4  
Based on the response on Question 3, a SmPC text in Section 5.2 regarding exposure in the paediatric 
population should be suggested by MAH. 
RESPONSE 
The MAH proposes the following text for inclusion into the Summary of Product Characteristics Section 
5.2, which is based on the response for Question 3. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients was investigated in 49 children aged 6-12 
years and 56 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone was administered as lurasidone hydrochloride 
at daily doses of either 20, 40, 80, 120 mg (6-17 years) or 160 mg (10-17 years only) for 7 days. The 
pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients aged 6–17 years was generally comparable to 
those observed in adults. 
Assessor’s comment:  
The proposed wording is acceptable with the following additions;   
In Section 4.2  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lurasidone in children aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. Current available data are described in section 5.2, but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
In Section 5.2 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients was investigated in 49 children aged 6-12 
years and 56 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone was administered as lurasidone hydrochloride 
at daily doses of either 20, 40, 80, 120 mg (6-17 years) or 160 mg (10-17 years only) for 7 days. 
There was no clear correlation between obtained plasma exposure and age or body weight. 
The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients aged 6–17 years was generally comparable 
to those observed in adults.  
5.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Overall conclusion 
The present study includes rich PK data in the paediatric population (6-17 years). The MAH has 
provided acceptable responses to the list of questions, except for the SmPC text where the Rapporteur 
has additional proposals.  
  Recommendation  
Page 26/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
Provided that the MAH agrees to implement the Rapporteur’s proposed wording in SmPC sections 4.2 
and 5.2 (see assessment of question 4 in section 5), this article 46 paediatric study is considered 
fulfilled. After completion of this procedure the MAH is requested to submit a type Ib variation to add 
the agreed wording to the SmPC.

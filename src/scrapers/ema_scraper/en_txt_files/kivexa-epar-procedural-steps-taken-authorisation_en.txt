204993 and 204994. Study 204993 was a phase I, 
relative oral bioavailability study of different fixed 
dose combinations of dolutegravir and lamivudine in 
healthy subjects. Study 204994 was an open-label,

worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC of 
the fixed-dose combination products Combivir, 
Dovato, Kivexa, Triumeq and Trizivir to include new 
information about use of the products in patients 
with renal impairment. Furthermore, minor editorial 
changes have been implemented throughout the 
Product Information and the lists of local 
representatives have been updated for all products. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
mL/min receiving Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ 
Trizivir may experience a 1.6-to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine 
exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, 
controlled trials comparing Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to 
neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
Page 3/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 
and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components 
administration for safety reasons.

Product Characteristics.

In vitro, abacavir inhibits CYP1A1. Concomitant

(CYP1A1 substrate) to HIV patients receiving the 
combination of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine 
(600mg/50mg/300mg once daily) led to an approximately 
three-fold higher riociguat AUC(0-∞) when compared to 
historical riociguat AUC(0-∞) reported in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, when riociguat is co-administered with abacavir, 
its dose may need to be reduced. Consult the riociguat

hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for

The drug-drug interaction between lamivudine and 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to reflect a potential drug-drug interaction between 
lamivudine and cladribine. This labelling update has 
been assessed via a separate Type II variation 
procedure (Zeffix; EMEA/H/C/242/II/53) with 
confirmation that the change should also be 
implemented for other lamivudine containing ViiV 
marketed HIV products as listed above. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly and an 
error in Trizivir SmPC in one of the sub-headings in 
the tabular summary of interaction information was 
also amended. 
C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
cladribine (CdA) was assessed in a type II variation of 
Zeffix (EMEA/H/C/242/II/53) based on a publication by 
Chtioui et al (Concomitant treatment with lamivudine 
renders cladribine inactive by inhibition of its 
phosphorylation. Br.J.Haematology. 2008; 144: 136-137). 
This article described a patient with chronic lymphoid 
leukaemia who was treated with CdA and Zeffix. No 
decrease of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count was 
observed after the first cycle of CdA. Zeffix was 
discontinued and the lymphocyte count decreased following 
the second and third cycles of CdA. The authors suspected 
a potential interaction based on intracellular 
phosphorylation when both medicines are administered 
concomitantly. In addition, an in vitro study was carried out 
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a 
healthy volunteer. This in vitro study showed that 
phosphorylated CdA levels were decreased with increasing 
3TC concentrations.

Holder identified 75 cases of different autoimmune 
and PL

These included Basedow’s/Graves’ disease, systemic lupus 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
erythematosus, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
to expand existing warning about immune 
reactivation syndrome with information on 
autoimmune disorders. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives was 
updated in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the product information is being

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Still’s syndrome and 
myasthenia gravis. Cases involving zidovudine, lamivudine, 
abacavir and fosamprenavir were identified. These 
disorders all developed when CD4 count was increased or 
increasing and viral load undetectable. The autoimmune 
disorders resolved (or improved) spontaneously or with 
specific therapy and while Anti-Retroviral Therapy was 
continued. Most of cases had a relatively late onset 
following Anti-Retroviral Therapy initiation except cases of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and adult onset Still’s disease. The 
time to onset ranged from 2 weeks to 37 months. 
While it was recognised that the number of cases is small, 
the long and variable time to onset probably causes 
underreporting of such adverse reactions and therefore 
little is known on the exact pathogenesis and the risk 
factors. The CHMP agreed that information about 
autoimmune disorders occurring in the context of immune 
reconstitution should be reflected in the product 
information.

the present type II variation to fulfil this request and 
update Annex IIB to reflect that an RMP is now in place for 
Kivexa, with all of the requirements that this implies. This 
RMP version “00” of 31 May 2012 formalises existing 
pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation activities 
for Kivexa and appropriately reflects its safety profile.  
Upon CHMP request the educational program and patient 
Alert Card concerning the abacavir hypersensitivity

co-administered. Conflicting clinical findings are reported in 
the literature with some data suggesting that HIV/HCV co-
infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be 
at risk of a lower response rate to pegylated 
interferon/ribavirin therapy. A possible intracellular 
mechanism has been postulated that ABC and RBV (two 
guanosine analogues) may be competing for the enzymes 
of a shared phosphorylation pathway. This could lead to a 
reduction in intracellular phosphorylated metabolites of 
ribavirin and, as a potential consequence, a reduced chance 
of sustained virological response (SVR) for Hepatitis C 
(HCV) in HCV co-infected patients treated with pegylated 
interferon plus RBV. SmPC section 4.5 has also been 
updated accordingly.

abacavir and lamivudine and/or in combination; data on 
the impact of selection for additional resistance mutations 
upon the susceptibility to abacavir or lamivudine in-vitro

patients. Furthermore the clinical experience data was 
organised under separate headings for treatment naïve 
patients and treatment-experienced patients. In addition 
the results of treatment-naïve studies CNA30021, 
EPZ104057 (HEAT), CNA109586 (ASSERT) are now

considers that the benefit-risk balance of Kivexa (3TC-ABC 
fixed dose combination) remains positive. However specific 
safety issues related to pharmacovigilance remain, which 
warrant a close monitoring. 
The main safety issue of Kivexa is hypersensitivity reaction 
(HSR) associated with ABC, which can be severe and life 
threatening and is a matter of concern. Studies showed an 
association between patients carrying HLA B5701 allele and 
occurrence of HSR. Based on this information the screening 
for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed 
before initiating treatment with Kivexa and Kivexa should 
not be used in patients known to carry HLA B5701 allele. 
Two further issues are of potential concern involving the 
use of Kivexa. 
First, results from a clinical trial show that Kivexa has been 
associated with a statistically significantly shorter time to 
virologic failure versus the group receiving emtricitabine-
tenofovir. Further clinical trial results have supported this 
signal and the MAH has submitted a variation to reflect this 
information on the product information. 
Secondly, a signal has been raised towards an association 
between ABC and risk of myocardial infarction. A causal 
relationship between myocardial infarction and ABC could 
neither be confirmed nor refuted, however as a 
precautionary measure, a warning was included in the SPC 
to reflect this information. 
Based on these issues, the CHMP is of the opinion that one 
additional five-year renewal on the basis of 
pharmacovigilance grounds is required. The MAH should

reaction (HSR) against the active substance abacavir at re-
initiation of treatment in a patient who previously had well 
tolerated this medicinal product. However afterwards, this 
patient was tested positive for the gene HLA-B*5701, which 
is associated with a higher HSR risk. There have also been 
case reports of HSR in patients who already had shown 
HSR symptoms before, but were tested HLA-B*5701 
negative. Based on these facts, it was regarded as 
necessary to amend the recommendation for HLA-B*5701 
testing before re-initiation of abacavir treatment and to 
highlight that HSR can also occur in HLA-B*5701 negative 
patients in the Product Information. Regarding the latter 
issue, also the information on HSR incidence was updated 
and is now reflecting the still significant HSR incidence 
obtained for HLA-B*5701 negative patients in recent 
studies which differentiated between HLA-B*5701 negative 
and positive patients.

Since then additional data derived from observational

Observational studies have shown an association between 
myocardial infarction and the use of abacavir. The patients 
studied have generally received antiretroviral treatment

were limited numbers of myocardial infarction in data from 
clinical trials and a small increase in risk could not be 
excluded. 
The data available so far present some inconsistencies and 
can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship 
between abacavir treatment and the risk of myocardial 
infarction. 
To date, there is no established biological mechanism to 
explain a potential increase in risk. 
The CHMP concluded that on the basis of the data available 
no recommendation could be made for changing the 
therapeutic management of patients. When prescribing 
Kivexa action should be taken to try to minimize all 
modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidaemia).

Retrospective studies reported a highly significant 
association between HLA-B*5701 allele carriage and ABC 
HSR. The MAH has conducted two new phase IV studies to 
assess the association of HLA-B*5701 and the occurrence 
of ABC HSR as well as the clinical utility of a 
pharmacogenetic pre-screening strategy prior to initiating 
therapy with ABC. 
Results from a prospective study demonstrate that patients 
with the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a significantly higher risk 
of developing an HSR than patients without the HLA-

B*5701 allele will develop and HSR versus 0 to 4% in 
patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele). Therefore, HLA-
B*5701 testing should be performed before any initiation of 
abacavir treatment. Moreover, CHMP recommended that 
patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele should not be 
considered for the treatment with abacavir. 
Furthermore, results show that skin patch testing fails to 
detect ABC HSR in a subset of patients and therefore 
should not be used in clinical practice for the purpose of 
HSR diagnosis.

information could be clinically helpful. The information is

experienced patients, a clinically significant reduction of 
susceptibility to abacavir has been demonstrated in clinical 
isolates of patients with uncontrolled viral replication, who 
have been pre-treated with and are resistant to other 
nucleoside inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance to abacavir

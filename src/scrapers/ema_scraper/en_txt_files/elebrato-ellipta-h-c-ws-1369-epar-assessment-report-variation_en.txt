FF/UMEC/VI (Trelegy Ellipta, Elebrato Ellipta) once-daily was approved in the European Union (EU) on 15 
November  2017  as  a  maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  ICS  and 
LABA.  FF is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity, UMEC is a long 
acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and VI is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). 
2.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The purpose of this variation application is to update the license for Trelegy Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta to 
provide information relating to the comparison of FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI and UMEC/VI, the comparison of 
FF/UMEC/VI  with  the  open  combination  of  FF/VI  +  UMEC,  and  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  FF,  UMEC, 
and  VI  following  inhalation  of  FF/UMEC/VI  in  patients  with  COPD.  Specific  revisions  to  the  SmPC  are 
proposed  for  Section  4.1  Therapeutic  indications,  Section  4.8  Undesirable  effects,  Section  5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties (Clinical Efficacy), and Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties. 
FF/UMEC/VI  (Trelegy  Ellipta,  Elebrato  Ellipta)  once-daily  is  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  as  a 
maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and LABA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/630775/2018 
Page 7/65 
 
  
  
The company is submitting a revised indication wording with changes strikethrough as follows:  
Trelegy Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled 
corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist (for effects on symptom control see section 5.1). 
The  revisions  are  primarily  based  on  data  from  Study  CTT116855  (IMPACT)  that  compared  FF/UMEC/VI 
with  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  over  52  weeks  in  subjects  with  COPD  using  a  primary  endpoint  of  the  annual 
rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations.  Additional revisions are based on data from Study 
200812  evaluating  the  non-inferiority  FF/UMEC/VI  compared  with  UMEC  +  FF/VI  over  24  weeks  in 
subjects  with  COPD  and  data  from  a  population  PK  analysis  (Study  208059)  of  FF,  UMEC,  and  VI  when 
administered from a single inhaler as FF/UMEC/VI or from separate inhalers as UMEC + FF/VI in subjects 
with COPD. 
Changes have been proposed in the SmPC for sections 4.1, 5.1 & 5.2 & 5.3, with an updated AE table in 
section 4.8. The PL is amended accordingly. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  new  clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application,  which  was  considered  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP. 
However, the current wording in sections of the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) associated 
with nonclinical study data contains exposure multiples calculated using data from population PK analyses 
for FF/UMEC/VI conducted for a subset of 74 COPD subjects from study CTT116853.  
Population  PK  analyses  have  been  updated  using  a  combined  dataset  from  821  COPD  subjects 
administered  FF/UMEC/VI  in  combination  from  studies  200812,  CTT116853  and  CTT116855  (see 
population  PK  report).  Using  exposure  values  from  this  larger  data  set  has  added  robustness  to  the 
exposure multiples calculated for each active component when comparing with animal systemic exposure 
data.  It  is  proposed  to  revise  the  nonclinical  related  exposure  multiples  in  the  SPC  accordingly,  thus 
aligning  with  other  references  to  the  3-study  combined  population  PK  analysis-derived  values  in  the 
current submission.  
This  was  reviewed  and  agreed  upon.  Therefore  the  section  5.3  is  updated  to  include  the  updated 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity figures.  
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated tailored Phase II Tier A environmental risk assessment was provided for the active ingredient 
fluticasone furoate (FF). For the active ingredients umeclidinium (UMEC) and vilanterol (VI) an update of 
the Phase I environmental risk assessments was not necessary.  
Environmental  Risk  Assessments  (ERAs)  for  all  three  ingredients  have  been  previously  undertaken  in 
monotherapy  and  different  combinations  undertaken  which  have  all  been  reviewed  and  approved  in  the 
EU via the Centralised Procedures. 
The risk characterization has been updated by new sales data (total sales of FF in all medical products in 
the EU (IMS 2016: 74 kg) and 5 years forecast in EU).  
PECsw–refined based on manufacturing forecast of all GSK registered products for the 5th year of sales in 
the EU is 0.0011 µg/L or 1.1 ng/L.

2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  outcome  of  the  updated  refined  risk  characterisation  shows  that  fluticasone  furoate  is  unlikely  to 
present  a  relevant  risk  to  organisms  in  the  aquatic  environment  and  in  groundwater  when  fluticasone 
furoate will reach surface waters via wastewater by the use of the maximum recommended dose.  
Therefore, further testing in the aquatic compartment will not be necessary and it can be concluded that 
the drug substance and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium (UMEC) and vilanterol. In addition, 
updated figures are also inserted in section 5.3 of the Product Information for each monocomponent 
based on the population PK analyses submitted in the present application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  is  submitting  this  application  to  update  the  marketing  authorisation  for  both  Trelegy  and 
Elebrato,  based  on  the  results  of  study  CTT116855  and  study  200812  and  the  population  PK  report 
208059. 
Study  CTT116855  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  study  that  compared  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  for  52  weeks  in  subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was 
designed to evaluate the benefit of FF/UMEC/VI over the FF/VI and UMEC/VI dual component medications 
in subjects with advanced, symptomatic COPD and at risk of exacerbation using a primary endpoint of the 
annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations. 
Study 200812 was a randomised, double blind, parallel group study comparing FF/UMEC/VI administered 
in  one  Ellipta  inhaler  with  FF/VI  +  UMEC  administered  in  separate  Ellipta  inhalers  over  24  weeks  in 
subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to 
FF/VI+UMEC using a primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Week 24 with a margin of non-inferiority of 50 
mL. 
The population PK analysis (Study 208059) evaluated combined data from a subset of COPD patients that 
participated  in  3  phase  IIIa/b  studies  (CTT116855,  CTT116853,  200812)  to  characterise  the  PK  of  FF, 
UMEC  and  VI  following  administration  of  FF/UMEC/VI  or  from  separate  inhalers  as  UMEC  +  FF/VI  or  as 
dual  FF/VI  or  UMEC/VI  from  an  Ellipta  inhaler  and  to  assess  the  effect  of  covariates  on  the  PK  of  FF, 
UMEC and VI. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The  report  of  a  population  PK  analysis  (Study  208059)  of  FF,  UMEC,  and  VI  when  administered  from  a 
single inhaler as FF/UMEC/VI or from separate inhalers as UMEC + FF/VI or as dual FF/VI or UMEC/VI in 
subjects with COPD is presented.  
The primary objectives of the analyses were: 
• 
• 
to characterize the population PK of FF, UMEC and VI in adults with COPD following administration 
of  FF/UMEC/VI  in  an  ELLIPTA  inhaler  and  following  administration  of  FF/VI+UMEC,  FF/VI, 
UMEC/VI. 
to  identify  influential  covariates,  among  age,  race,  gender,  weight,  body  mass  index,  smoking 
status,  concurrent  medications  (cytochrome  P450  inducers/inhibitors,  Pgp  inhibitors),  lung 
function  status  in  terms  of  reversibility  post  albuterol/salbutamol,  percent  predicted  FEV1  at 
screening (PPFEV1) and creatinine clearance on the PK of FF, UMEC and VI in patients with COPD. 
The primary endpoints of the analyses were: 
•  Non-linear  mixed  effects  model  (NONMEM)  generated  post-hoc  estimates  for  FF,  UMEC  and  VI 
population  PK  parameters  and  associated  inter-subject  variability  and  residual  error:  (Apparent 
clearance [CL/F], apparent volume of distribution (V/F), absorption rate constant [Ka]). 
•  Derived PK parameters: Area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) and Cmax. 
Methods 
FF, UMEC and VI plasma concentration – time data were used for population PK analyses using non-linear 
mixed  effects  modelling  with  NONMEM  v7.4.  A  model-based  estimation  approach  was  undertaken 
whereby  the  plasma  data  for  FF,  UMEC  and  VI  from  Studies  200812,  CTT116853  and  CTT116855  were 
combined.  The previously reported population PK models for FF, UMEC and VI served as starting points 
for the structural model development (adequacy was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations).  The data 
below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were treated as censored data and all data were analysed with the 
full likelihood approach (M3 method). Covariate analysis was undertaken once the base structural model 
had been developed. The adequacies of the population PK models were assessed through diagnostic plots 
and visual predictive checks.  The post-hoc individual parameter estimates from each model for FF, UMEC 
and  VI  were  utilized  to  estimate  individual  systemic  exposure  measures.    The  geometric  mean  and  the 
associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AUCss and Cmax at steady state were summarized for each

Analysis  Population:  A  total  of  821  subjects  from  3  studies  contributed  to  population  PK  analysis. 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  were  similar  across  each  of  the  3  population  PK 
datasets (FF, UMEC and VI).  
The  PK  of  FF  in  200812,  CTT116853  and  CTT116855  was  well-described  by  a  two-compartment  model 
with  first-order  absorption  and  first-order  elimination.  The  only  covariates  found  to  be  statistically

significant  were  Japanese  heritage  and  FF/VI  treatment  on  inhaled  clearance  (CL/F)  but  no  dose 
adjustment was warranted based on the predicted systemic exposure. 
The PK of UMEC in 200812, CTT116853 and CTT116855 was well-described by a two-compartment model 
with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Weight, age and smoking status were found to be 
significant  covariates  on  CL/F  and  weight  was  also  a  significant  covariate  on  the  apparent  volume  of 
distribution  of  the  central  compartment  (V2/F).  However,  no  dose  adjustment  was  warranted  for  these 
covariates based on the predicted systemic exposure. 
The  PK  of  VI  in  200812,  CTT116853  and  CTT116855  was  well-described  by  a  two-compartment  model 
with  first-order  absorption  and  first-order  elimination.  Weight  and  smoking  status  were  found  to  be 
significant  covariates  on  CL/F  and  V2/F,  respectively.  However,  no  dose  adjustment  was  warranted  for 
these covariates based on the predicted systemic exposures. 
The final parameter estimates for the three population PK models are presented in the Table below.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  report  of  a  population  PK  analysis  (Study  208059)  of  FF,  UMEC,  and  VI  when  administered  from  a 
single inhaler as FF/UMEC/VI or from separate inhalers as UMEC + FF/VI or as dual FF/VI or UMEC/VI in 
821 subjects with COPD is submitted. 
A  total  of  821  subjects  from  3  studies  provided  samples  for  the  population  PK  analysis.  Data  for  few 
subjects  (16/821=  2%),  at  one  or  both  visits  could  not  be  utilized  due  to  discrepancy  between  dosing 
time record and PK sample collection time record and were considered as protocol deviations. There were 
714, 622, and 817 COPD subjects with that contributed to final FF, UMEC and VI population PK datasets 
respectively from the combined data from CTT116855, 200812 and CTT116853 studies. FF, UMEC, and VI 
datasets  contained  2948,  2589  and  3331  plasma  concentration-time  observations  respectively. 
Approximately, 13% to 41% samples were BLQ. 
All FF, UMEC, VI plasma concentrations were well interspersed with historical data.

FF,  UMEC  and  VI  PK  were  all  adequately  described  by  a  two-compartment  model  with  first-order 
absorption.  
For FF, Japanese heritage and FF/VI treatment were significant covariates on apparent inhaled clearance.  
For UMEC, weight, age and smoking status on apparent inhaled clearance and weight on apparent volume 
of  distribution  were  significant  covariates.  For  VI,  weight  on  apparent  inhaled  clearance  and  smoking 
status on apparent volume of distribution were significant covariates. 
For  Japanese  heritage  COPD  subjects,  FF  CL/F  was  estimated  to  be  35%  lower,  but  the  increase  in  FF 
systemic  exposure  in  subjects  of  Japanese  heritage  versus  non-Japanese  heritage  as  these  systemic 
exposures remain well below the threshold for FF-induced reduction of serum cortisol.  
The typical value of FF CL/F was 513 L/h for subjects receiving FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg). For FF/VI 
(100/25 mcg) administration, FF CL/F was estimated to be 42% higher. However, such values in subjects 
receiving  FF/VI  versus  FF/UMEC/VI  is  not  likely  to  be  clinically  relevant  as  these  systemic  exposures 
remain well below the threshold for FF-induced reduction of serum cortisol.  
In a similar manner, no clinically relevant change in UMEC or VI systemic exposure was estimated after 
accounting for the effect of the influential covariates namely age, weight and smoking status. 
In  summary,  population  PK  analyses  (similar  to  historical)  demonstrated  that  the  effects  of  these 
covariates on PK were marginal and no dose adjustment was deemed necessary for FF, UMEC or VI based 
on these covariates.  
Steady state AUCss (geometric mean, pg*h/mL) and Cmax,ss (geometric mean, pg/mL) for FF/UMEC/VI 
were consistent with historical data for FF/VI and UMEC/VI and there was no clinically relevant difference 
in FF, UMEC or VI systemic exposure when administered as FF/UMEC/VI or UMEC+FF/VI. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Population  PK  analyses  for  FF/UMEC/VI  using  combined  data  from  Studies  CTT116855,  200812  and 
CTT116853 were consistent with those for the components when given in dual combination. The models 
described  adequately  the  PK  of  FF,  UMEC  and  VI  in  patients  with  COPD.  No  dose  adjustments  are 
warranted based on age, weight, smoking status or race. 
In conclusion, the results of the Population PK analysis are adequately reflected in the section 5.2 of the 
SmPC, including also an update to the elderly section.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Two efficacy studies have been submitted in this variation. The MAH request for changes to the indication 
is based on study CTT116855 and on Study 200812 as supporting efficacy data. 
The  methods/design/populations  will  be  presented  separately  for  each  study  hereafter.  However  for  the 
results analyses will be presented together.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  of  Study  CTT116855  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to  reduce  the 
annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  compared  with  dual  therapy  of  FF/VI  or  UMEC/VI  in 
subjects with COPD.  
The  primary  objective  of  Study  200812  was  to  compare  the  effect  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  FF/VI+UMEC  on 
lung function after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Study design 
CTT116855  study  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  study  that  compared  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  for  52  weeks  in  subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was 
designed to evaluate the benefit of FF/UMEC/VI over the FF/VI and UMEC/VI dual component medications 
in subjects with advanced, symptomatic COPD and at risk of exacerbation using a primary endpoint of the 
annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations.  
At total of 10,355 subjects were randomized in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population at study centres in 37 
countries. The total duration of subject participation was approximately 55 weeks, consisting of a 2-week 
Run-in Period, 52-week Treatment Period, and a 1-week Safety Follow-up Period.  Clinic visits occurred at 
pre-screening/screening, Randomization (Day 1), and after 4, 16, 28, 40, and 52 weeks of treatment. In 
addition, there was a safety follow-up telephone contact or clinic visit conducted one week after 
completing the last study visit. 
Eligible subjects were randomized (2:2:1) to the FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI, and UMEC/VI treatment groups. 
Figure 1: Study Schematic 
Discussion of Study Design 
Use of the FF/VI and UMEC/VI active comparator groups is consistent with the CHMP  Note for Guidance 
on Fixed Dose Combination Medicinal Products which suggest studies be conducted preferably against the 
component  medications  [EMA/CHMP/158268/2017].  Moreover,  use  of  these  active  comparators  extends 
the  previous  development  work  that  supported  the  approval  of  Trelegy  Ellipta/Elebrato  Ellipta  by  using 
partial factorial analysis to demonstrate the contribution of both the UMEC and FF components of Trelegy 
Ellipta/Elebrato  Ellipta  based  on  comparisons  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  the  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  dual 
components,  respectively.  This  approach  was  done  in  agreement  with  Scientific  Advice  from  CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/2498/1/2012/II and EMEA/H/SA/2498/1/FU/1/2013/II).

Study population 
The  enrolment  criteria  for  Study  CTT116855  were  consistent  with  those  from  Study  CTT116853  which 
supported  the  initial  MAA  application.  As  Study  CTT116855  was  designed  to  assess  benefit  on 
exacerbations, patients with advanced, symptomatic COPD and at risk of an exacerbation were enrolled.  
Additionally,  CTT116855  was  intentionally  designed  to  be  as  inclusive  as  possible  with  regards  to  the 
enrolment of subjects with significant CV disease.  For example, subjects with a past history of previous 
myocardial  infarction  (MI)  (>6  months  prior  to  Screening)  and  New  York  Heart  Association  Class  1–3 
heart  failure  were  eligible for  inclusion  in  the  study.    In  addition,  patients  with  first  degree  heart  block, 
second  degree  heart  block  Mobitz  Type  1,  and  corrected  QT  interval  using  Friedicia's  formula  (QTc[F]) 
measurements up to 530 msec in patients with a QRS >120 msec could be enrolled. 
Basic inclusion criteria were: male or female subjects, 40-years of age or older with a diagnosis of COPD, 
a history of cigarette smoking of ≥10 pack-years, a post-albuterol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) 
ratio of <0.70, with symptomatic COPD based on a score of ≥10 on the CAT.  Requirements for severity 
of airflow obstruction and exacerbation history requirements were either: 
• 
• 
a post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 50% predicted normal and a documented history of ≥ 1 moderate 
or severe COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months or, 
a  post-bronchodilator  50%  ≤  FEV1  <  80%  predicted  normal  and  a  documented  history  of  ≥  2 
moderate  COPD  exacerbations  or  a  documented  history  of  ≥  1  severe  COPD  exacerbation 
(hospitalized) in the previous 12 months. 
Additionally,  consistent  with  CHMP  follow-up  advice  on  the  study  design,  subjects  must  have  been 
receiving daily maintenance treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to screening.  
Subjects  who  had  a  current  diagnosis  of  asthma,  COPD  caused  by  α1-antitrypsin  deficiency,  other 
significant  respiratory  disorders  (e.g.,  active  tuberculosis,  lung  cancer,  pulmonary  hypertension),  lung 
resection  within  the  previous  12  months,  or  other  clinically  significant  diseases  in  the  opinion  of  the 
investigator, were excluded from the study.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations on patients treated 
with FF/UMEC/VI compared with both FF/VI and UMEC/VI.  
The rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations is an established clinically relevant endpoint based on 
known  associations  with  disease  morbidity  and  mortality.  Exacerbations  of  moderate  severity  were 
defined  as  those  requiring  treatment  with  oral/systemic  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics  while  severe 
exacerbations  were  defined  as  those  requiring  in-patient  hospitalisation  or  resulted  in  death.  Mild 
exacerbations were defined as those self-managed by the subjects and were not associated with the use 
of corticosteroids or antibiotics or hospitalisation. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Change from Baseline trough FEV1 at Week 52 comparing FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI 
•  Change from Baseline SGRQ Total Score at Week 52 comparing FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI  
• 
Time to first on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbation comparing FF/UMEC/VI  with FF/VI and 
with UMEC/VI 
•  Annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbations  comparing  FF/UMEC/VI  with 
UMEC/VI in the subset of subjects with a blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/µL 
• 
Time to first on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbation comparing FF/UMEC/VI with UMEC/VI in 
the subset of subjects with a blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/µL 
•  Annual  rate  of  on-treatment  severe  exacerbations  comparing  FF/UMEC/VI  with  FF/VI  and  with 
UMEC/VI

ICS  in  COPD,  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbations  and  the  time  to  first  on-

treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbation  in  the  subset  of  subjects  with  a  blood  eosinophil  count  ≥  150 
cells/µl  for  the  comparison  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  UMEC/VI  (evaluating  the  effect  of  FF)  were  defined  as 
secondary endpoints. 
Trough  FEV1  at  Week  52  was  chosen  as  a  secondary  endpoint  for  evaluation  of  lung  function  as  it  is  a 
robust,  well  established  and  objective  means  of  demonstrating  bronchodilator  efficacy  and  duration  of 
effect.  Additional  assessments  of  trough  FEV1  were  obtained  throughout  the  trial  to  evaluate  response 
over time. 
The  SGRQ  was  selected  as  a  widely-accepted  measure  to  evaluate  change  in  disease-specific  HRQoL. 
Subjects  completed  the  SGRQ  for  COPD  (SGRQ-C),  a  COPD-specific  version  of  the  SGRQ  designed  to 
measure  the  impact  of  the  disease  on  their  HRQoL.  The  primary  analysis  of  SGRQ  Total  score  was  at 
Week 52 (secondary endpoint). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for this instrument of 
a 4-unit reduction in SGRQ Total Score from baseline was used for the responder analysis. The CAT was 
used  to  measure  COPD-specific  health  status  with  the  MCID  of  a  >2-unit  improvement  (decrease  in 
score)  from  baseline  used  for  the  responder  analysis.  Symptom  assessments,  all  defined  as  ‘other’ 
endpoints included the TDI using the 1  unit TDI score as the accepted MCID for responder analysis and 
diary  assessments  of  rescue  medication  use  and  night-time  awakenings.  An  additional  efficacy  endpoint 
of  note  was  all-cause  mortality.  Inclusion  of  this  endpoint  was  considered  appropriate  for  evaluation 
based on the COPD severity of the patient population under study, the association of exacerbations with 
mortality, and the large sample size and duration of the study. While all-cause mortality was categorized 
as an efficacy endpoint to assess potential benefit, this endpoint may also be used as a safety endpoint. 
Safety Assessments for Study CTT116855 
In consideration of the classes of medications studied and the co-morbidities associated with COPD, this 
study  was  also  designed  to  provide  a  full  assessment  of  safety  by  evaluating  adverse  events  (AEs), 
serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESI),  in  particular  CV  events  and 
pneumonia,  CV  effects  (ECGs,  including  evaluation  of  QTc(F),  and  vital  signs),  and  clinical  laboratory 
tests.  All deaths and non-fatal serious adverse event reports were adjudicated by an independent Clinical 
Endpoint  Committee  (CEC)  and  a  pre-specified  Major  Adverse  Cardiac  Event  (MACE)  analysis  was 
conducted. 
Safety endpoints included: 
• 
Incidence of AEs   
•  Adjudicated Serious Adverse Reports 
•

• 
Incidence of pneumonia.

Statistical Methods/Sample size 
In study  CTT116855, sample size calculations were based on the primary endpoint, the annual rate of on 
treatment moderate/severe exacerbations for the co-primary treatment comparisons of FF/UMEC/VI with 
FF/VI and with UMEC/VI. A total of 10,000 subjects were needed to provide 90% power to detect a 
reduction in the annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the FF/UMEC/VI arm compared with 
the UMEC/VI arm (assuming a true 15% reduction) and a reduction compared with the FF/VI arm 
(assuming a true 12% reduction). Calculations were based on a negative binomial regression model and 
used a two-sided 1% significance level. 
For  the  analysis,  the  overall  type  I  error  was  controlled  at  α=0.05.  Multiplicity  across  the  co-primary 
treatment  comparisons  was  accounted  for  by  using  the  truncated  Hochberg  procedure  with  a  truncation 
parameter of γ=0.6. 
Additionally, multiplicity was controlled across the key secondary endpoints/treatment comparisons using 
a hierarchical, closed testing procedure. The secondary hypothesis tests were grouped sequentially in two 
blocks of two comparisons each (lung function and symptoms, and time to first exacerbation event). Each 
block of comparisons was also adjusted for multiplicity using the truncated Hochberg method as described 
for the primary endpoint analysis with a truncation parameter of γ=0.6 for the first block and a truncation 
parameter of γ=1 for the second block.  
The  primary  analysis  of  the  number  of  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  was  performed  using  a 
generalized linear model assuming the negative binomial distribution. The primary analysis used data for 
the  ITT  population  collected  while  subjects  were  on  study  treatment.  The  model  included  terms  for 
treatment  group,  gender,  exacerbation  history  (≤   1,  ≥   2  moderate/severe),  smoking  status  at 
Screening, baseline disease severity (as post-bronchodilator % predicted FEV1) and geographical region, 
with the logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable. A sensitivity analysis was performed where 
all available data collected until the time of study withdrawal was used. For this sensitivity analysis, the 
total  number  of  events  and  the  total  time  in  the  study  (both  on-treatment  and  off-treatment)  prior  to 
study  withdrawal  were  used  in  the  analysis  model.  Further,  several  additional  sensitivity  analyses  were 
performed to evaluate the impact of missing data on the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
The  secondary  endpoints  of  trough  (pre-dose  in  morning)  FEV1  and  SGRQ  Total  score  were  analysed 
using  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  with  covariates  of  treatment  group,  smoking  status  at 
Screening, baseline, geographical region, and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by baseline and visit by 
treatment  group.  The  proportion  of  responders  according  to  SGRQ  Total  Score  was  analysed  using  a 
generalized  linear  mixed  model  with  a  logit  link  function,  including  terms  for  treatment  group,  smoking 
status  (Screening),  geographical  region,  visit,  baseline  SGRQ  Total  Score  and  baseline  by  visit  and 
treatment group by visit interactions. 
The  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  time  to  first  moderate/severe  exacerbation  used  Cox’s 
proportional  hazards  model,  adjusting  for  treatment  group,  gender,  exacerbation  history  (≤   1,  ≥   2

moderate/severe),  smoking  status  at  Screening,  baseline  disease  severity  (as  %  post-bronchodilator 
predicted FEV1) and geographical region.  
The  secondary  endpoint  of  annual  rate  of  severe  exacerbations  was  analysed  in  the  same  way  as  the 
primary endpoint. 
Rescue use (mean number of occasions per day and percentage of rescue-free days) and mean number 
of night-time awakenings per night were analysed in a similar way to trough FEV1. 
Populations Analysed  
A  total  of  10,367  subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  blinded  study  treatment.    Of  these,  12  subjects 
were  randomised  in  error  and  recorded  as  screen  failures,  leaving  10,355  subjects  included  in  the  ITT 
Population.    Subjects  were  randomised  using  a  2:2:1  ratio  to  the  FF/UMEC/VI  (N=4151),  FF/VI 
(N=4134), and UMEC/VI (N=2070) groups, respectively.

A total of 13,906 subjects from 37 countries were enrolled (signed an ICF) in this study.  
Of  the  subjects  enrolled,  807  (6%)  failed  pre-screening  and  of  those  who  attended  the  Screening  Visit, 
2744 (21%) failed screening (Table 5).  Most of the screen failures were due to subjects not meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (2415  subjects  [18%]).    The  most  frequently  failed  inclusion  criteria  were 
history of exacerbations (753 subjects [27%]), severity of COPD disease (533 subjects [19%]), and CAT 
score at Screening (324 subjects [12%]).  The most frequently failed exclusion criteria were unresolved 
pneumonia  and/or  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbation  (358  subjects  [13%]),  abnormal  chest  X-ray 
(133  subjects  [5%]),  and non-compliance  (124  subjects  [5%]).    A  subject  could  have  only one  primary 
reason  as  determined  by  the  Investigator  for  screen  failure,  but  more  than  one  inclusion/exclusion 
criterion could have been selected. 
A  total  of  10,367  subjects  were  randomised,  but  12  were  randomised  in  error  (screen  failures);  thus, 
10,355 subjects were included in the ITT Population.  The largest subject participation was from the US 
(2406  subjects  [23%])  followed  by  Germany  (1187  subjects  [11%]),  Argentina  (972  subjects  [9%]), 
China (535 subjects [5%]), and Spain (499 subjects [5%]).  The number of subjects included in the ITT 
Population per study site ranged from 1 to 52. 
The majority of subjects completed study treatment (77%) and completed the study (88%).  Of the 23% 
of  subjects  who  were  prematurely  discontinued  from  study  treatment,  the  most  frequently  reported 
reasons  were  AE  (7%),  decision  by  subject  or  proxy  (7%),  and  lack  of  efficacy  (6%).    Of  the  12%  of 
subjects  who  were  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  study,  the  most  frequently  reported  reasons  were 
withdrawal of consent (6%) and AE (4%).   
Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment  was  lower  in  the 
FF/UMEC/VI  group  (18%)  than  in  the  FF/VI  (25%)  and  UMEC/VI  (27%)  groups.    The  percentage  of 
subjects  who  prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AE  or  lack  of  efficacy  was  lower  in  the 
FF/UMEC/VI group (AE: 6%; lack of efficacy: 4%) than in the FF/VI (AE: 8%; lack of efficacy: 8%) and 
UMEC/VI  (AE:  9%;  lack  of  efficacy:  8%)  groups.    The  time  to  premature  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment  is  shown  in  Figure  4.    The  percentage  of  subjects  who  prematurely  discontinued  study

treatment was lower in the FF/UMEC/VI group than in the FF/VI or UMEC/VI groups through the course of 
the study.   
Overall, the percentage of subjects who were prematurely withdrawn from the study was slightly lower in 
the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  (11%)  than  in  the  FF/VI  (13%)  and  UMEC/VI  (14%)  groups.  The  reasons  for 
premature  study  withdrawal  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  The  percentage  of  subjects  who 
prematurely  withdrew  from  the  study  was  slightly  lower  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  than  in  the  FF/VI  or 
UMEC/VI groups through the course of the study.

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Based  on  common  enrolment  criteria  and  overlap  in  participating  countries,  the  populations  in  Studies 
CTT116855  and  200812  were  similar  with  respect  to  demographics  and  key  baseline  characteristics  of 
smoking  status,  smoking  history,  severity  of  impairment  in  airflow  obstruction,  reversibility  status, 
exacerbation history and CAT score. Subjects enrolled in both studies were primarily White, the majority 
were male, and the average age was 65 to 66 years. Subjects were symptomatic based on a mean CAT 
score of 19 to 20, had severe airflow obstruction based on a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 41 to 45% 
and  virtually  all  subjects  experienced  ≥1  moderate  or  severe  exacerbation  in  the  12  months  prior  to 
screening.

Subjects  were  required  to  be  on  COPD  maintenance  therapy  for  at  least  3  months  prior  to  study  entry 
and  consistent  with  the  severity  of  the  study  populations  the  majority  of  subjects  were  using  various 
combinations  of  COPD  maintenance  therapies.  In  Study  CTT116855,  the  most  common  COPD 
maintenance medications reported at entry were ICS + LABA + LAMA (34%), ICS + LABA (26%), LABA + 
LAMA (8%), and LAMA (7%).  Similar results were obtained in Study 200812. 
Supportive study - Study 200812 
Study 200812 was a randomised, double blind, parallel group study comparing FF/UMEC/VI administered 
in  one  Ellipta  inhaler  with  FF/VI  +  UMEC  administered  in  separate  Ellipta  inhalers  over  24  weeks  in 
subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to

FF/VI+UMEC using a primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Week 24 with a margin of non-inferiority of 50 
mL. 
Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  FF/UMEC/VI  and  placebo  or  FF/VI  and  UMEC  for  24  weeks 
(N=1055). The randomization was stratified by the number of long-acting bronchodilators received during 
the  Run-in.  The  total  duration  of  subject  participation  was  approximately  27  weeks,  consisting  of  a  2-
week  Run-in  period,  24-week  Treatment  Period  and  a  1-week  Safety  Follow-up  Period.  Clinic  visits 
occurred at Pre-screening/Screening, Randomization (Day1), and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. 
In  addition,  there  was  a  safety  follow-up  telephone  contact  or  clinic  visit  conducted  1  week  after 
completing the last study visit. 
Study population 
To  maintain  consistency  across  patient  populations,  the  enrolment  criteria  were  the  same  as  those 
described for Study CTT116855. Additionally, consistent with Study CTT116855, subjects must have been 
receiving daily maintenance treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to screening.

Statistical Methods/Sample size 
The  treatment  comparison  of  primary  interest  was  to  evaluate  the  non-inferiority  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to 
FF/VI+UMEC  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  at  Week  24.    No  p  values  for  treatment 
comparisons  were  reported  as  the  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  test  the  non-inferiority  of 
FF/UMEC/VI  to  FF/VI+UMEC.  No  inference  on  non-inferiority or  superiority  was  drawn  for  the  secondary 
and other efficacy endpoints. 
The  planned  sample  size  of  816  evaluable  subjects  provided  90%  power  to  determine  non  inferiority  of 
FF/UMEC/VI  to  FF/VI+UMEC  based  on  change  from  baseline  in  of  trough  FEV1  at  Week  24,  when  the 
margin  of  non-inferiority  was  50  mL  and  the  true  mean  treatment  difference  was  assumed  to  be  0  mL. 
This  used  a  one  sided  2.5%  significance  level  and  an  estimated  residual  standard  deviation  (SD)  for 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 24 of 220 mL (based on MMRM analyses of previous Phase 
IIIa studies in COPD subjects). 
It  was  estimated  that  approximately  20%  of  subjects  who  were  randomized  would  either  discontinue 
study  treatment  or  be  excluded  from  the  Modified  Per  Protocol  (mPP)  Population  at  Week  24,  therefore 
approximately 1020 subjects were required to be randomized. The mPP Population comprised all subjects 
in  the  ITT  Population  who  did  not  have  a  full  protocol  deviation  considered  to  impact  efficacy.  Any  data 
following a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation or pneumonia were excluded from mPP analysis due 
to the potential impact of the exacerbation, pneumonia, or the medications used to treat these events, on 
the study findings.  Subjects with partial protocol deviations considered to impact efficacy were included 
in  the  mPP  Population  but  had  their  data  excluded  from  analyses  from  the  time  of  partial  protocol 
deviation onwards.   
The  primary  efficacy  analyses  used  the  mPP  Population.  The  secondary  and  other  efficacy,  and  safety 
summaries and analyses used the ITT Population.

The  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  at  Week  24  was  analysed  using  a  MMRM  analysis  including 
trough  FEV1  recorded  at  each  of  Week  4,  Week  12,  and  Week  24.    No  imputation  was  made  for  any 
missing  numerical  data.    Covariates  included  baseline  FEV1,  stratum  (number  of  long  acting 
bronchodilators  used  during  the  Run  in  period:  0/1  or  2),  visit  number,  geographical  region,  treatment, 
visit-by-baseline  interaction,  and  visit-by-treatment  interaction.    Least  squares  means  and  LS  mean 
change from baseline values for each treatment group with associated standard error (SE) and 95% CIs 
were calculated.  The estimated treatment difference along with corresponding SE and 95% CI was also 
calculated.  The  variance  covariance  matrix  was  assumed  to  be  unstructured.    Two  models  were  fitted: 
one with a response variable of trough FEV1, and one with a response variable of change from baseline in 
trough FEV1. 
The  change  in  SGRQ  total  score  from  baseline  and  the  TDI  focal  score  were  analysed  using  a  MMRM 
analysis.    No imputation was  made  for  any  missing  numerical  data.    Covariates  included  baseline  SGRQ 
score or Baseline Dyspnoea Index (BDI) (as applicable), stratum (number of long-acting bronchodilators 
used  during  the  Run  in  period:  0/1  or  2),  visit  number,  geographical  region,  treatment,  visit-by- 
baseline/BDI (as applicable) interaction, and visit-by-treatment interaction.  Least squares means and LS 
mean  change  from  baseline  values  for  each  treatment  group  with  associated  SE  and  95%  CI  were 
calculated.    The  estimated  treatment  difference  along  with  corresponding  SE  and  95%  CI  was  also 
calculated. 
The  proportion  of  responders  at  Week  24  for  SGRQ  and  TDI  total,  using  cut-off  as  defined  for  Study 
200812  was  analysed  using  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  including  data  at  Week  12  and  Week  24. 
Covariates  included  baseline  SGRQ  score  or  BDI  (as  applicable),  treatment  group,  stratum  (number  of 
long acting bronchodilators used during the Run in  period: 0/1 or 2), geographical region, visit number, 
visit by baseline/BDI (as applicable) interaction, and visit-by-treatment interaction. 
Time  to  first  moderate  or  severe  COPD  exacerbation  was  analysed  using  Cox’s  proportional  hazards 
model.    Covariates  included  treatment  group,  gender,  exacerbation  history  (0  to  1,  or  ≥2  moderate  or 
severe  exacerbations  within  12  months  prior  to  Screening),  stratum  (number  of  long  acting 
bronchodilators used during the Run in period: 0/1 or 2), geographical region, and baseline FEV1 (percent 
predicted normal).

•  Results for both studies CTT116855 and 200812 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy results will be presented for the pivotal trial in the first instance, but where endpoints were 
common across both clinical studies these results will be presented in tandem. 
a) Pivotal Study – CTT116855 
Primary endpoint: Annual Rate of On-Treatment Moderate/Severe Exacerbations 
Study CTT116855 used well established criteria to define COPD exacerbations, consistent with regulatory 
authority guidance on COPD drug development. The diagnosis of an exacerbation was made and recorded 
by  the  investigator  after  contact  with  the  subject.  Symptoms  of  COPD  were  recorded  daily  by  subjects 
using  an  eDiary  and  specific  criteria  for  worsening  symptoms  were  used  to  trigger  contact  with  the 
investigator.  The  symptoms  and  criteria  were  consistent  with  those  used  in  previous  exacerbations 
studies for the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination product and FF/VI. 
The  results  for  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment 
moderate/severe  exacerbations  of  COPD  in  Study  CTT116855  are  summarized  below.    FF/UMEC/VI 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe

The  supportive  analysis  of  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbations  using  the 
Poisson  regression  model  and  sensitivity  analyses  investigating  the  impact  of  missing  data,  which 
included  analyses  using  both  on-  and  off-treatment  data,  using  on-treatment  data  and  the  Jump  to 
Reference (J2R) assumption for missing data following treatment discontinuation, and using on- and off-
treatment  data  and  the  J2R  assumption  for  missing  data  following  study  withdrawal  were  supportive  of 
the findings for the primary analysis for the comparisons of FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI and UMEC/VI.

Rate Ratios and Associated Sensitivity Analyses (CTT116855) 
The  effect  of  FF/UMEC/VI  on  the  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  was  maintained 
when  both  on-  and  off-treatment  data  were  included  in  the  analysis.  For  this  analysis,  FF/UMEC/VI 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  COPD 
exacerbations compared with FF/VI (11% reduction, p<0.001) and UMEC/VI (20% reduction, p<0.001). 
Annual Rate of On-Treatment Severe Exacerbations 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  severe 
exacerbations  (i.e.,  resulting  in  hospitalisation/prolonged  hospitalisation  or  death)  compared  with 
UMEC/VI  (p<0.001).  The  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  severe  COPD  exacerbations  for 
FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI was not statistically significant.

FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  SGRQ  Total  Score  with  a  LS  mean 
change  from  baseline  of  -5.5  units  at  Week  52  (compared  with  the  MCID  of  4  units)  and  a  statistically 
significant difference compared with FF/VI (between group difference of -1.8 units; 95% CI: -2.4, -1.1; 
p<0.001)  and  compared  with  UMEC/VI  (between  group  difference  of  -1.8  units;  95%  CI:    2.6,  1.0; 
p<0.001). Additionally, the odds of being an SGRQ responder versus a non-responder at Week 52 were 
statistically significantly higher for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI (p<0.001), indicative 
of clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL with FF/UMEC/VI over the dual combinations.

All analyses presented for this study are based on the TDI Population which comprised of 5058 subjects 
at selected sites who completed a pre-dose BDI assessment at Day 1. 
At  Week  52,  FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  TDI  focal  score 
compared  with  FF/VI  (p=0.020).    The  treatment  difference  for  FF/UMEC/VI  compared  with  UMEC/VI  at 
Week 52 did not meet statistical significance. The odds of being a TDI responder versus non-responder at 
Week 52 were statistically significantly higher for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI.

Findings  for  the  TDI  focal  score  indicated  similar  benefit  of  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI  +  UMEC  to  improve 
dyspnoea  at  Week  24.  Both  treatments  resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  dyspnoea  as 
measured by TDI at Week 24 based on TDI focal scores of ≥1. TDI focal scores and the odds of being a 
TDI responder versus non-responder were similar between groups at Week 24.

Rescue Medication Use 
Rescue medication use was evaluated in Study CTT116855 only. 
Across  treatment  groups,  there  was  a  slight  trend  for  increased  use  of  rescue  medication  over  time, 
although this was less apparent in the FF/UMEC/VI treatment group.

last  day  of  treatment  and  was  based  on  the  actual  date  of  death.    Twenty  three  percent  of  subjects 
prematurely  discontinued  study  treatment  prior  to  Week  52.  The  incidence  of  on  treatment  deaths  was 
low  across  groups  with  1.20%  for  FF/UMEC/VI,  1.19%  for  FF/VI,  and  1.88%  for  UMEC/VI.  The  most 
common  primary  causes  of  death  across  treatment  groups  were  CV  (including  sudden  death)  and 
respiratory  (all  <1%  across  groups).  Death  was  adjudicated  as  associated  with  COPD  for  18  of  50 
subjects  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group,  14  of  49  subjects  in  the  FF/VI  group,  and  15  of  39  subjects  in  the 
UMEC/VI group.  
The  FF/UMEC/VI  group  demonstrated  a  statistically significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  on-treatment  all-
cause  mortality  compared  with  the  UMEC/VI  group  (HR:  0.58;  95%  CI:  0.38,  0.88;  p=0.011, 
corresponding to a risk reduction of 42.1%). For the comparison of FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI, the risk of on 
treatment  all-cause  mortality  was  similar  (HR:  0.95;  95%  CI:  0.64,  1.40,  p=0.780,  corresponding  to  a 
risk reduction of 5.5%).

Table 21: Kaplan-Meier Plot of On-treatment Time to All-cause Mortality (Study 
CTT116855, ITT Population) 
Off-treatment  data  for  all-cause  mortality  included  data  collected  from  subjects  after  discontinuation  of 
study  treatment  whether  or  not  they  remained  in  the  study.    When  on  and  off-treatment  data  were 
included  in  the  analysis,  vital  status  was  available  for  9781  subjects  (94%)  of  the  study  population  at 
Week 52. 
When  both  on-and  off  treatment  mortality  data  were  included  in  the  analysis,  the  significant  risk 
reduction  in  all-cause  mortality  was  maintained  for  FF/UMEC/VI  compared  with  UMEC/VI,  indicating  a 
robustness  of  treatment  effect.  Specifically,  FF/UMEC/VI  significantly  reduced  the  risk  of  on-  and  off-
treatment  all-cause  mortality  compared  with  UMEC/VI  (HR  0.71;  95%  CI:  0.51,  0.99;  p=0.043, 
corresponding  to  a  risk  reduction  of  28.6%).  The  risk  of  all-cause  mortality  was  similar  for  FF/UMEC/VI 
compared with FF/VI (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.20; p=0.458). 
Efficacy in Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses were performed for Study CTT116855 only.  
For  Study  CTT116855,  an  assessment  was  performed  for  the  ITT  Population  to  determine  whether  the 
effect  of  treatment  on  the  primary  endpoint  was  modified  by  the  different  levels  of  the  following 
subgroups:  gender, age group, race, geographical region, exacerbation history, and CV risk. 
No  significant  interactions  of  treatment  with  gender,  race,  geographical  region,  or  number  of  CV  risk 
factors  were  observed  on  the  primary  endpoint.  A  significant  subgroup-by-treatment  interaction  was 
observed for exacerbation history (p=0.010) and age group (p=0.052). 
Further  investigation  of the  significant interaction  of  treatment  with  age  showed  that the  point estimate 
for  the  HR  favoured  FF/UMEC/VI  over  both  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  for  each  age  category.    The  significant 
interaction is likely due to a difference in the magnitude of the rate ratio, which was greater in the 65 to 
74 year age category and lower in the ≤64 year category for both treatment comparisons. 
Relative to the comparison of FF/UMEC/VI with FF/VI in the overall ITT Population, there were no clinically 
relevant  differences  in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  in  any  subgroup  categories

(Figure  8).    All  point  estimates  of  the  rate  ratio  favoured  FF/UMEC/VI  with  some  variation  in  the 
magnitude of rate reduction. 
For  the  subgroups  of  gender  and  number  of  CV  risk  factors,  point  estimates  for  the  FF/UMEC/VI  versus 
FF/VI rate ratio were all contained within the 95% CI of the comparison within the overall ITT Population.  
At  least  one  of  the  point  estimates  for  a  category  within  the  race,  geographical  region,  exacerbation 
history,  and  age  subgroups  fell  outside  the  95%  CI  of  the  comparison  within  the  overall  ITT  Population 
(Figure  8).    These  results  tended  to  occur  in  smaller  subgroup  categories  and  were  not  considered 
clinically relevant due to overlapping 95% CI with other categories within the respective subgroup.

Relative  to  the  comparison  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  UMEC/VI  in  the  overall  ITT  Population,  there  were  no 
clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  annual  rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  in  any  subgroup 
category.    All  point  estimates  of  the  rate  ratio  for  these  subgroups  favoured  FF/UMEC/VI  with  some 
variation in the magnitude of rate reduction, apart from the comparison in the ‘Other’ race category. 
For the subgroups of gender, exacerbation history, and number of CV risk factors, point estimates for the 
FF/UMEC/VI versus UMEC/VI rate ratio were all contained within the 95% CI of the comparison within the 
overall  ITT  Population.    At  least  one  of  the  point  estimates  for  a  category  within  the  age,  race,  and 
geographical  region  subgroups  fell  outside  the  95%  CI  of  the  comparison  within  the  overall  ITT 
Population.    These  results  tended  to  occur  in  smaller  subgroup  categories  and  were  not  considered 
clinically relevant due to overlapping 95% CI with other categories within the respective subgroup.

COPD Exacerbations by Eosinophil Subgroup 
In  CTT116855,  the  two  secondary  endpoints  of  model-estimated  annual  rate  of  on-treatment 
moderate/severe exacerbations and time to first on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbation, evaluated 
efficacy in the subgroup of subjects in the ITT Population with a baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 
cells/µL.    For  these  two  endpoints,  the  key  comparison  was  between  the  FF/UMEC/VI  and  UMEC/VI 
groups,  although  the  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI  groups  were  also  compared,  and  treatment  comparisons 
were also made in the subgroup of subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count of <150 cells/µL. 
Annual Rate of On-treatment Moderate/Severe Exacerbations by Eosinophil Subgroup 
Regardless  of  baseline  blood  eosinophil  count  subgroup,  treatment  with  FF/UMEC/VI  resulted  in  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  model-estimated  annual  rate  of  on  treatment  moderate/severe 
exacerbations  at  Week  52  compared  with  FF/VI  (both  p≤0.003)  and  compared  with  UMEC/VI  (both 
p≤0.034).    For  the  comparison  between  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI,  the  magnitude  of  the  reduction  was 
greater  for  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  baseline  blood  eosinophil  count  of  <150  cells/µL  (rate 
reduction:  20%;  rate  ratio:  0.80;  95%  CI:  0.73,  0.88;  p<0.001)  than  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with 
baseline  blood eosinophil count  of  ≥ 150  cells/µL  (rate  reduction:  12%;  rate ratio: 0.88;  95%  CI:  0.81, 
0.96; p=0.003).  For the comparison between FF/UMEC/VI and UMEC/VI, the magnitude of the reduction 
was  greater  for  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  baseline  blood  eosinophil  count  of  ≥ 150  cells/µL  (rate 
reduction:  32%;  rate  ratio:  0.68;  95%  CI:  0.62,  0.75;  p<0.001)  than  in  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with 
baseline  blood  eosinophil  count  of  <150  cells/µL  (rate  reduction:  12%;  rate  ratio:  0.88;  95%  CI:  0.78, 
0.99; p=0.034).

Time to First Moderate/Severe Exacerbation by Eosinophil Subgroup 
Based  on  the  time  to  first  analysis,  treatment  with  FF/UMEC/VI  in  subjects  with  a  baseline  blood 
eosinophil  count  of  ≥ 150  cells/µL  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  a 
moderate/severe  exacerbation  by  15.0%  compared  with  FF/VI  (HR:  0.85;  95%  CI:  7.8%,  21.7%; 
p<0.001)  and  by  23.2%  compared  with  UMEC/VI  (HR:  0.77;  95%  CI:  15.4%,  30.4%;  p<0.001).  In 
subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count of <150 cells/µL, treatment with FF/UMEC/VI resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation by 14.6% compared with 
FF/VI  (HR:  0.85;  95%  CI:  6.1%,  22.3%;  p<0.001).  The  reduction  in  risk  compared  with  UMEC/VI  was 
not statistically significant (4.0%; HR: 0.96; 95% CI: -8.2%, 14.8%; p=0.503).

Primary endpoint: Change from Baseline in Trough FEV1 at Week 24 
In this study, the efficacy of Trelegy Ellipta has been compared to FF/VI (92/22 micrograms) + UMEC (55 
micrograms),  co-administered  once  daily  as  a  multi-inhaler  therapy,  in  a  multicentre,  randomised, 
double-blind  24-week  study  in  patients  with  COPD  with  a  history  of  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations 
within the prior 12 months.  
The  study  met  its  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  demonstrated  non-inferiority  of  Trelegy  Ellipta  to 
FF/VI+UMEC in the improvement from baseline in trough FEV1  at Week 24.   The lower bound of the CI 
was greater than the pre specified non-inferiority margin of -50 mL.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Common  efficacy  endpoints  in  Studies  CTT116855  and  200812  include  time  to  first  moderate/severe 
COPD  exacerbation,  trough  FEV1,  and  results  for  the  SGRQ  and  TDI  scores  with  responder  analyses.  
Additional efficacy endpoints that were included only in Study CTT116855 include the primary endpoint of 
moderate/severe  exacerbations  of  COPD,  the  annual  rate  of  severe  exacerbations,  all-cause  mortality, 
rescue medication use, and night-time awakenings.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Key findings from Study CTT116855 are: 
• 
• 
• 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in  the 
annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  compared  with  FF/VI  (15% 
reduction, p<0.001) and UMEC/VI (25% reduction, p<0.001). 
In  a  sensitivity  analysis,  FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the 
annual rate of on- and off-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with FF/VI 
(11% reduction, p<0.001) and UMEC/VI (20% reduction, p<0.001). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  decreased  risk  of  an  on-treatment 
moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbation  compared  with  FF/VI  (hazard  ratio  [HR]  of  0.85,  p<0.001) 
and  UMEC/VI  (HR  of  0.84,  p<0.001),  corresponding  to  risk  reductions  of  14.8%  and  16.0%, 
respectively (based on analysis of time to first event) with similar results including both on- and 
off-treatment data (risk reductions 12.8% and 14.5%, respectively, p<0.001).

• 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment 
severe  COPD  exacerbations  (i.e.,  resulting  in  hospitalisation  or  death)  compared  with  UMEC/VI 
(34% reduction, p<0.001). The reduction in the on-treatment annual rate of on-treatment severe 
COPD  exacerbations  for  FF/UMEC/VI  compared  with  FF/VI  was  not  statistically  significant  (13% 
reduction, p=0.064). 
•  Regardless  of  baseline  blood  eosinophil  count  subgroup  (i.e.,  <150  cells/µL  and  ≥150  cells/µL) 
treatment with FF/UMEC/VI resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of on 
treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbations  compared  with  FF/VI  (both  p≤0.003)  and  compared 
with UMEC/VI (both p≤0.034). 
• 
FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of on-treatment all-cause 
mortality compared with UMEC/VI (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.88; p=0.011, corresponding to a 
risk reduction of 42.1%).  For the comparison of FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI, the risk of on treatment 
all-cause mortality was similar (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.40, p=0.780, corresponding to a risk 
reduction of 5.5%). When both on-and off treatment mortality data were included in the analysis, 
the significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality was maintained for FF/UMEC/VI compared with 
UMEC/VI. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  Week  52 
compared  with  FF/VI  (mean  treatment  difference  of  97mL,  p<0.001)  and  UMEC/VI  (mean 
treatment difference of 54mL, p<0.001). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  improvement  of  -5.5  points  from  baseline  in 
SGRQ  Total  Score  at  Week  52  compared  with  FF/VI  (mean  treatment  difference  of  -1.8  units, 
p<0.001) and UMEC/VI (mean treatment difference of -1.8 units, p<0.001). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  statistically  significant  greater  odds  of  being  a  responder  vs.  non-
responder based on SGRQ Total Score (response defined as a decrease in score from baseline of 
4 or more) at Week 52 compared with FF/VI (odds ratio 1.41, p<0.001) and UMEC/VI (odds ratio 
1.41, p<0.001). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  subject-recorded  daily  use  of 
rescue albuterol compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI when evaluated as both the mean number of 
occasions  of  rescue  use  per  day  and  the  percentage  of  rescue-free  days  (p<0.001  for  both 
comparisons). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  mean  number  of  night-time 
awakenings per night compared with UMEC/VI (p<0.001 for all four weekly analysis periods over 
52  weeks)  and  FF/VI  (p≤0.021  for  all  analysis  periods,  except  for  Weeks  1-4  and  Weeks  33-36 
which were not statistically significant different). 
The  supporting  Study  200812  demonstrated  the  non-inferiority  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to  FF/VI+UMEC  multiple 
inhaler triple therapy for the improvement in lung function based on the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 
at  Week  24.  Additionally,  the  comparability  of  both  treatments  was  supported  by  results  for  the  SGRQ 
and  TDI  scores  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  reported  an  on  treatment  moderate/severe  COPD 
exacerbation. 
While  the  MAH  has  indeed  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  the  triple  combination  over  the  dual 
components,  and  the  non-inferiority  of  the  triple  combination  over  the  components  administered 
Assessment report

separately but coincidentally, this in itself does not support the broadening of the indication for use as a 
first-line therapy. The use of the triple combination is currently recommended only as a step-up from dual 
therapy. However it is agreed that the step up from the dual therapy LABA/LAMA is considered sufficiently 
demonstrated and this is introduced in the section 4.1.  
It is agreed that information on the effect of the product on exacerbations is clinically useful, and so this 
information is included in section 5.1, with a cross-reference to that section included in section 4.1. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the assessment of the clinical data, the SmPC is updated to reflect the changes above 
discussed. (Please refer also to the section update of PI later in the report). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This  section  focuses  on  the  safety  data  from  the  pivotal  study  CTT116855  due  to  the  volume  of  data 
(10355 subjects for 1 year). Safety data from the supportive study 200812 (1055 subjects for 6 months) 
are briefly summarized at the end of this Section. 
Knowledge on the safety profile 
There  are  known  pharmacological  effects  of  ICS,  LAMAs,  and  LABAs.    For  ICS,  these  include 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal-axis effects, local oropharyngeal effects, and ocular effects.  In addition, 
in patients with COPD, treatment with ICS has been associated with bone disorders (specifically, disorders 
associated with decreased bone mineral density and fractures) and pneumonia. For LAMAs, these include 
CV  effects,  ocular  disorders,  urinary  retention,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  along  with  anticholinergic 
effects  (e.g.,  dry  mouth,  cough)  and  for  LABAs,  these  include  CV  and  neuromuscular  effects.  The 
potential for treatment with FF/UMEC/VI to result in these effects was evaluated in the clinical trials. 
Patient exposure 
Subject exposure data were summarised for the ITT Population. 
a) CTT116855 
A total of 10,355 subjects were randomised and included in the CTT116855 ITT Population; 4151 subjects 
to the FF/UMEC/VI group, 4134 subjects to the FF/VI group, and 2070 subjects to the UMEC/VI group. 
Mean  duration  of  treatment  exposure  was  higher  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  (325.9  days)  compared  with 
the FF/VI (304.5 days) and UMEC/VI (298.7 days) groups.  A total of 76%, 69%, and 68% of subjects in 
the  FF/UMEC/VI,  FF/VI,  and  UMEC/VI  groups,  respectively,  were  exposed  to  treatment  for  51  to  53 
weeks.    The  proportion  of  subjects  exposed  to  treatment  in  each  duration  category  was  higher  in  the 
FF/UMEC/VI group than in the FF/VI or the UMEC/VI group throughout the 52 weeks of the study.   The 
reduction  in  the exposure rate  during  the last  week of  the  study,  Week  52,  ranging  from  53% to  59 % 
across groups, was a result of the study visit window.

Mean duration of treatment exposure was the same in both treatment groups (162.1 days in FF/UMEC/VI 
and 162.1 days in FF/VI+UMEC).  Greater than 90% of subjects in both treatments groups were exposed 
to  treatment  for  23  to  25  weeks,  and  94%  and  95%  of  subjects  were  exposed  to  treatment  for  ≥20 
weeks in the FF/UMEC/VI  and FF/VI+UMEC groups, respectively.  The proportion of subjects exposed to 
treatment in each duration category was similar between the treatment groups throughout the study. 
Adverse Events 
a) CTT116855 
The most frequently reported on-treatment AEs were viral URTI and COPD.  The incidence and exposure-
adjusted rate of viral URTI were similar across treatment groups. The incidence of COPD was 11% in the 
FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI groups and 13% in the UMEC/VI group, with a lower exposure adjusted rate in the 
FF/UMEC/VI  group  (152.9)  compared  with  the  FF/VI  (172.1)  and  UMEC/VI  (207.3)  groups.    Pneumonia 
and oral candidiasis had higher incidences and exposure-adjusted rates in the ICS-containing groups (i.e., 
FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI) compared with the UMEC/VI group.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
On-Treatment Fatal Adverse Events 
a) CTT116855 
On-treatment fatal SAEs were reported for 68 (2%), 76 (2%), and 49 (2%) subjects in the FF/UMEC/VI, 
FF/VI,  and  UMEC/VI  groups,  respectively,  with  respective  exposure-adjusted  rates  of  26.4,  27.8,  and 
38.3.    COPD  was  the  most  frequently  reported  fatal  SAE  in  each  treatment  group,  reported  with  an 
incidence of <1% in each treatment group.  
The  events  in  the  SOC  of  Cardiac  disorders  were  reported  with  an  incidence  of  <1%  in  each  treatment 
group. 
Pneumonia was also reported with an incidence of <1% in each treatment group. 
b) 200812 
A total of 10 on treatment fatal SAEs were reported for 8 subjects (4 subjects [<1%] in each treatment 
group). The most commonly reported on treatment fatal SAEs (PTs) were of ‘pneumonia’ (reported for 1 
subject  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  and  2  subjects  in  the  FF/VI+UMEC  group),  ‘COPD’  (reported  for  1 
subject in each treatment group), and ‘acute MI’ (reported for 1 subject in each treatment group). 
Non-Fatal Serious Adverse Events 
a) CTT116855 
The incidence of on-treatment non-fatal SAEs was  similar across treatment groups (19% to 21% across 
groups) with exposure-adjusted rates of 405.4, 395.9, and 405.1 in the FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI, and UMEC/VI 
groups,  respectively.    The  most  common  non-fatal  on  treatment  SAEs  were  COPD  (10%  to  13%  across 
groups) and pneumonia (2% to 4% across groups).  The exposure-adjusted rate of COPD was lower for 
the  FF/UMEC/VI  (145.6)  and  FF/VI  (158.2)  groups  compared  with  the  UMEC/VI  group  (192.0).    The 
exposure-adjusted rate of pneumonia was higher for ICS-containing groups (i.e., FF/UMEC/VI [50.6] and 
FF/VI [46.3]) compared with the UMEC/VI group (30.6).

The  incidence  of  on  treatment  AEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  were  similar  between  the 
treatment  groups.    Three  percent  of  subjects  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  and  2%  of  subject  in  the 
FF/VI+UMEC  group  experienced  of  on  treatment  AEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  from  the  study,  the  most 
common of which was ‘COPD’. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  for  Studies  CTT116855  and  200812  have  been  defined  as  AEs  which 
have  specified  areas  of  interest  for  FF,  UMEC,  or  VI  or  for  the  COPD  population,  given  their  known 
mechanisms of action. 
For  study  CTT116855,  the  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  rates  in  other  AESI  groups  were  generally 
similar  across  treatment  groups,  including  those  associated  with  ICS-containing  groups  (e.g.,  Ocular 
effects and Decreased bone mineral density and associated fractures).  
Of  the  AESI  groups,  CV  effects  was  most  frequently  reported,  with  similar  incidences  and  exposure-
adjusted rates of any event in that group reported across treatment groups (10% to 11% and 157.0 to 
167.2,  respectively).    Local  steroid  effects  and  Pneumonia  were  the  next  most  frequently  reported 
groups,  and  were  reported  at  a  similar  incidence  in  the  ICS-containing  FF/UMEC/VI  (337  subjects  [8%] 
and 317 subjects [8%], respectively) and FF/VI (301 subjects [7%] and 292 subjects [7%], respectively) 
groups  and  more  frequently  compared  with  the  UMEC/VI  group  (108  subjects  [5%]  and  97  subjects 
[5%], respectively).  
The  exposure  adjusted  rates  of  any  event  in  the Local  steroid  effects  and  Pneumonia  AESI  groups  were 
higher in the FF/UMEC/VI (114.4 and 95.8, respectively) and FF/VI (107.3 and 96.6, respectively) groups 
compared with the UMEC/VI group (80.1 and 61.2, respectively). 
a) 200812 
The  incidence  of  AESIs  was  low  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  CV  effects  being  the  most  frequently 
reported  (6%  in  FF/UMEC/VI  and  5%  in  FF/VI+UMEC).    The  next  most  common  AESIs  were  lower 
respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) excluding pneumonia (3% in FF/UMEC/VI and 2% in FF/VI+UMEC) and 
pneumonia (3% in FF/UMEC/VI and 4% in FF/VI+UMEC). 
Pneumonia 
a)CTT116855 
There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  any  event  in  the  Pneumonia  AESI  group  in  the  ICS-containing 
FF/UMEC/VI  (317  subjects  [8%])  and  FF/VI  (292  subjects  [7%])  groups  compared  with  the  UMEC/VI 
group (97 subjects [5%])).  The proportion of pneumonia events resulting in hospitalisation was generally 
similar across treatment groups (207 of 346 events [60%] in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 177 of 319 events 
[55%]  in  the  FF/VI  group,  and  58  of  101  events  [57%]  in  the  UMEC/VI  group).    The  proportion  of 
pneumonia  events  associated  with  infiltrates  on  X-ray/CT  scan  was  48%  (166  of  346  events)  in  the 
FF/UMEC/VI  group,  49%  (156  of  319  events)  in  the  FF/VI  group,  and  40%  (40  of  101  events)  in  the 
UMEC/VI group. 
Based on analysis of time to first event, the risk of any on-treatment event in the Pneumonia AESI group 
was similar for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.19; p=0.848). The risk of

any  on-treatment  event  in  the  Pneumonia  AESI  group  was  statistically  significantly  increased  for

Cardiovascular Events 
a) CTT116855 
CV  effects  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AESI  group  and  any  event  in  that  group  occurred  with  a 
similar  incidence  across  treatment  groups  (10%  to 11%  across  groups).  Overall,  the  exposure  adjusted 
rates of these CV AESIs were similar across treatment groups. 
The  incidence  of  ischaemic  heart  disease  (SMQ)  was  similar  across  treatment  groups  (1%  to  2%).  
However,  the  exposure-adjusted  rates  for  FF/UMEC/VI  and  UMEC/VI  (26.1  and  30.6,  respectively)  were 
higher compared to FF/VI (18.5).  
MACE analyses 
Two  analyses  of  MACE  were  performed,  using  broad  and  narrow  MACE  definitions.    The  broad-definition 
MACE  included  the  ischaemic  heart  disease  SMQ  (MI  SMQ  and  other  ischaemic  heart  disease  SMQ) 
excluding  fatalities,  the  central  nervous  system  haemorrhages  and  cerebrovascular  conditions  SMQ 
excluding  fatalities,  and  adjudicated  CV  deaths.    To  investigate  events  relating  specifically  to  MI  rather 
than other cardiac ischaemic events, the narrow MACE definition included only the PTs of non-fatal MI and 
non-fatal  acute  myocardial  in  addition  to  central  nervous  system  haemorrhages  and  cerebrovascular 
conditions SMQ excluding fatalities. 
The  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  rates  for  any  on-treatment  MACE  events  using  the  broad  and 
narrow definitions were similar across treatment groups.  A total of 80 subjects (2%) in the FF/UMEC/VI 
group,  60  subjects  (1%)  in  the  FF/VI  group,  and  37  subjects  (2%)  in  the  UMEC/VI  group  reported  any 
MACE  (narrow  definition)  with  exposure-adjusted  rates  of  22.3,  18.8,  and  22.4  for  FF/UMEC/VI,  FF/VI, 
and  UMEC/VI,  respectively.    There  were  20  (<1%)  adjudicated  CV  deaths  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group,  27 
(<1%)  in  the  FF/VI  group,  and  16  (<1%)  in  the  UMEC/VI  group.    The  exposure-adjusted  rate  of 
adjudicated  CV  death  was  lower  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  (5.4)  group  compared  with  the  FF/VI  (7.8)  and 
UMEC/VI  (9.4)  groups.    The  exposure-adjusted  rate  of  non-fatal  central  nervous  system  haemorrhages 
and cerebrovascular conditions was higher in the FF/UMEC/VI (10.8) group compared with the FF/VI (7.2) 
and UMEC/VI (5.9) groups.  A total of 133 subjects (3%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 100 subjects (2%) in 
the FF/VI group, and 66 subjects (3%) in the UMEC/VI group reported any MACE (broad definition) with 
exposure-adjusted rates of 44.7, 35.3, and 44.8 for FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI, and UMEC/VI, respectively.

ECG Findings 
For the ITT Population, 12-lead ECGs were obtained at baseline (Screening) and 15 to 45 minutes post-
dose after 4, 28, and 52 weeks of treatment. In addition, a subset of subjects performed a pre-dose ECG 
in addition to the post-dose ECG at the Week 4 Visit (Pre-dose ECG Population).  
ITT  Population:  At  baseline,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  abnormal  ECG  findings  was  similar  across 
treatment  groups  (31%  to  32%  across  groups).  At  any  visit  post-baseline,  abnormal  findings  were 
reported for 1783 subjects (44%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 1757 subjects (44%) in the FF/VI group, and 
860  subjects  (44%)  in  the  UMEC/VI  group.  For  subjects  with  normal  ECG  findings  at  baseline,  a  worst 
case post-baseline shift to abnormal was reported for 584 subjects (14%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 602 
subjects (15%) in the FF/VI group, and 297 subjects (15%) in the UMEC/VI group.

CV  AESIs  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AESI  group  and  occurred  with  a  similar  incidence  in  the 
FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI+UMEC groups (6% and 5%, respectively).  All of the CV AESI subgroups occurred 
at a similar incidence in both treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in Subgroups 
Study CTT116855 specified safety subgroup summaries and analyses by gender, age, race, geographical 
region  (including  a  US/Non-US  sites  subgroup  for  summaries  only),  exacerbation  history,  and  CV  risk.  
Additional  subgroups  were  evaluated  for  pneumonia  evaluation  and  fatalities,  and  included  smoking 
status, BMI, and pneumonia history. Subgroup analyses were not specified for Study 200812. 
The safety subgroup analyses for Study CTT116855 are summarized as follows: 
•  Overall,  no  notable,  clinically  relevant,  or  unexpected  differences  between  subgroups  were 
observed.  Where differences were observed, these were mainly due to a relatively low number of 
subjects and/or a low number of events. 
• 
Female  subjects  reported  a  higher  rate  of  any  on-treatment  AE  and  male  subjects  reported  a 
higher  rate  of  any  on-treatment  SAEs  and  fatal  SAEs  (including  adjudicated  serious  adverse 
reports) for all treatment groups and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment 
or withdrawal from the study for FF/UMEC/VI and sFF/VI. 
•  Subjects in the ≤64 years of age subgroup had lower rates of AEs, SAEs and fatal SAEs (including 
adjudicated  serious  adverse  reports)  and  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment or withdrawal from the study, while subjects within the 65 to 74 years of age subgroup 
had similar to higher rates of events, and subjects within the 75 to 84 years of age subgroup had 
higher rates of events, with the exception of the 75 to 84 years of age subgroup in the UMEC/VI 
group,  which  had  a  similar  or  lower  rate  of  events  compared  with  the  ITT  Population.    The 
UMEC/VI  group  had  the  smallest  number  of  subjects  in  the  75  to  84  years  of  age  subgroup 
compared with the other age subgroups; therefore, any differences  found in  the UMEC/VI group 
may  be  due  to  smaller  total  duration  at  risk.  Interpretation  of  findings  the  ≥85  years  of  age 
subgroup  were  limited  due  to  the  relatively  low  number  of  subjects  (<1%  of  the  population  in 
each treatment group). 
• 
The  rate  of  any  on-treatment  AEs,  fatal  SAEs  and  SAEs  (including  adjudicated  serious  adverse 
reports and adjudicated non-fatal serious adverse reports) was higher in Asian subjects compared 
with the overall ITT Population, with the exception of any on-treatment AEs and fatal SAEs within 
the FF/UMEC/VI group. Within each treatment group, the rate of adjudicated fatal serious adverse 
reports and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the 
study was similar or lower in Asian subjects compared with the overall ITT Population. 
• 
From  the  five  geographical  subgroups  (Western  Europe,  Asia,  North  America,  and  South 
America),  subjects  in  South  America  had  the  lowest  rate  of  AEs,  SAEs  (including  adjudicated 
serious  adverse  reports)  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment/study  discontinuation  compared  with  the 
ITT  Population.    The  highest  rates  of  AEs,  SAEs  (including  adjudicated  serious  adverse  reports) 
and  AEs  leading  to  treatment/study  discontinuation  compared  with  the  ITT  Population  were  in

subjects in North America (FF/UMEC/VI and UMEC/VI groups) or in Asia (FF/VI).  Overall, within 
each  treatment  group,  subjects  in  Western  Europe  had  a  lower  rate  of  any  on-treatment  fatal 
SAEs. 
• 
For  subjects  with  a  history  in  the  prior  year  of  <2  moderate/severe  exacerbations  and  subjects 
with  a  history  ≥2  moderate/severe  exacerbations,  no  notable  differences  were  seen  within  each 
treatment  group  in  the  rate  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  fatal  SAEs  (including  adjudicated  serious  adverse 
reports) and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the 
study compared with the ITT Population. 
•  Of    those  subjects  with  no,  1,  or  >=  to  2  CV  risk  factors,  subjects  with  >=  to  2CV  risk  factors 
reported a higher rate of AEs, SAEs and fatal SAEs (including adjudicated serious adverse reports) 
and  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or  withdrawal  from  the  study 
when compared with the ITT Population. 
•  No notable differences were observed in the incidence and rate of fatal SAEs and adjudicated fatal 
serious adverse reports for current and former smokers compared with the ITT Population. 
• 
The rate of on-treatment fatal SAEs was higher for subjects with a BMI <25 kg/m2 and subjects 
with  a  BMI  ≤21  kg/m2  compared  with  the  ITT  Population.    Similar  findings  were  seen  for  on 
treatment adjudicated fatal serious adverse reports; however, the differences between the rates 
were  generally  less  pronounced.    The  rate  of  on-treatment  fatal  SAEs  and  on  treatment 
adjudicated  fatal  serious  adverse  reports  was  lower  for  subjects  with  a  BMI  <25  kg/m2  and 
subjects with a BMI >21 kg/m2 compared with the ITT Population. 
•  No notable differences were observed in the rate of any on-treatment fatal SAEs and adjudicated 
fatal serious adverse reports for subjects with a past history of pneumonia and subjects with no 
past history of pneumonia compared with the ITT Population. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs  that  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or 
withdrawal from the study was 6% to 9% across treatment groups with lower exposure-adjusted rates in 
the FF/UMEC/VI (92.1) group compared with the FF/VI (128.7) and UMEC/VI (144.3) groups.

Group (Study CTT116855, ITT Population). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population supporting the extension of indication comprised a total of 10355 subjects treated 
with the closed triple combination FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 for 1 year in Study CTT116855. Different to 
prior  studies,  patients  with  significant  cardiovascular  (CV)  disease  were  included  in  order  to  allow  an 
assessment  of  safety  that  was  more  representative  of  the  'real  world'  population  (e.g.  subjects  with  a 
past history of previous myocardial infarction [>6 months prior to Screening], New York Heart Association 
Class  1–3  heart  failure,  and  unstable  or  life-threatening  cardiac  arrhythmia  requiring  intervention  [>3 
months prior to Screening] were eligible). 
The  incidence  of  CV  risk  factors  was  similar  across  treatment  groups.  Sixty-eight  percent  of  subjects 
reported  any  CV  risk  factor,  with  40%  of  subjects  reporting  ≥ 2  CV  risk  factors.  The  most  frequently 
reported  CV  risk  factors  were  hypertension  (53%),  hypercholesterolaemia  (33%),  diabetes  mellitus 
(15%),  and  coronary  artery  disease  (12%).  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  a  family  history  (first 
degree relatives only) of premature coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke was 11% to 
16% overall and was similar across treatment groups. 
The  most  frequently  reported  on-treatment  AEs  were  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (URTI)  and 
COPD.  The  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  rate  of  viral  URTI  were  similar  across  treatment  groups 
(11% to 13% and 186.7 to 191.9, respectively). The incidence of COPD was 11% in the FF/UMEC/VI and 
FF/VI  groups  and  13%  in  the  UMEC/VI  group,  with  a  lower  exposure-adjusted  rate  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI 
group  (152.9)  compared  with  the  FF/VI  (172.1)  and  UMEC/VI  (207.3)  groups.  Pneumonia  and  oral 
candidiasis  had  higher  incidences  and  exposure-adjusted  rates  in  the  ICS-containing  groups  (i.e., 
FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI) compared with the UMEC/VI group. 
ICS-containing treatments are known to increase the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. This signal was 
first  identified  in  the  TORCH  study  (Calverley  et  al  2007).  This  was  a  large  clinical  study  of  3  years 
treatment  duration  comparing  the  fluticasone  propionate/salmeterol  combination  with  its  component 
parts and placebo in COPD patients. This study was considered in a 2010 review of the risk of pneumonia 
in COPD patients by the CHMP Pharmacovigilance Working Party that concluded that the treatment with 
an ICS, either alone or in combination with a LABA, increases the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. On

27  April  2015  the  European  Commission  triggered  a  referral  under  Article  31  of  Directive  2001/83/EC 
resulting from pharmacovigilance data and requested the PRAC to assess the benefit-risk balance of ICS 
containing  medicinal  products  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  COPD.  The  review  confirmed  the  risk  of 
pneumonia with these products. The review, however, did not find any conclusive evidence of differences 
in this risk for different products.  
In  study  CTT116855,  as  expected  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of  pneumonia  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group 
(298 subjects [7%]) and in the FF/VI group (264 subjects [6%]) compared with the UMEC/VI group (93 
subjects  [4%]).  The  pneumonia  event  rate  per  1000  subjects  were  88.6  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  and 
86.8 in the FF/VI group compared to 57.7 in the UMEC/VI group. The higher risk of pneumonia of about 
35%  comparing  FF/UMEC/VI  with  UMEC/VI  has  to  be  taken  into  account  when  balancing  the  benefit 
against the risk. 
When  comparing  the  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI  groups,  the  AEs  with  higher  incidences  (viral  URTI,  COPD, 
URTI,  and  pneumonia)  had  a  similar  risk  for  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI  groups.  When  comparing  the 
FF/UMEC/VI  and  UMEC/VI  groups,  the  risk  of  COPD  was  lower  for  FF/UMEC/VI  group  while  the  risk  of 
pneumonia and oral candidiasis was lower for UMEC/VI, as expected based on ICS class effects. While it 
seems  evident  that  the  triple  combination  was  generally  well  tolerated  when  compared  with  the  dual 
therapies, the difference in the rates of pneumonia  between the ICS- and non ICS-containing arms was 
evident.  This  reflects  the  known  adverse  event  profile  of  ICS  medications,  and  has  an  impact  on  the 
substitution  potential  of  the  triple  therapy  versus  the  LAMA/LABA  combinations.  Therefore,  a  paragraph 
describing the above data on pneumonia is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
A  total  of  244  subjects  were  reported  to  have  had  a  fatal  SAE  (on-treatment  and  post-treatment).  One 
hundred ninety-three subjects were reported to have had an on-treatment fatal SAE.  
On-treatment  fatal  SAEs  were  reported  with  an  incidence  of  2%  in  each  treatment  group  and  with 
exposure-adjusted  rates  of  26.4,  27.8,  and  38.3  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI,  FF/VI,  and  UMEC/VI  groups, 
respectively. COPD was the most frequently reported fatal SAE in each treatment group, reported with an 
incidence of <1% in each treatment group and with exposure-adjusted rates of 3.5, 6.4, and 6.5 in the 
FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI, and UMEC/VI groups, respectively. The events in the SOC of Cardiac disorders were 
reported  with  an  incidence  of  <1%  in  each  treatment  group;  a  lower  exposure-adjusted  rate  was 
observed  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  (4.8)  and  FF/VI  (4.6)  groups  compared  with  the  UMEC/VI  (7.7)  group. 
Nevertheless, no consistent patterns or imbalances were noted across treatment groups when examining 
the  primary  causes  of  death.  Cardiac  disorders  and  COPD  exacerbation  are  categories  expected  in 
patients with severe and very severe COPD. 
The  incidence of  on-treatment  SAEs  (fatal  and  non-fatal)  was  similar  across treatment  groups  (21 %  to 
23%  across  groups).  The  most  common  on-treatment  SAEs  (fatal  and  non-fatal)  were  COPD  (11%  to 
13% across groups) and pneumonia (3% to 4% across groups). The exposure-adjusted rate of COPD was 
lower for the FF/UMEC/VI (149.1) and FF/VI (164.5) groups compared with the UMEC/VI group (198.4). 
The exposure-adjusted rate of pneumonia was higher for the FF/UMEC/VI (53.3) and FF/VI (47.7) groups 
compared with the UMEC/VI group (32.4) as expected.  
Two  MACE  analyses  were  performed,  using  broad  and  narrow  MACE  definitions.  The  broad-definition 
MACE  included  the  ischaemic  heart  disease  SMQ  (myocardial  infarction  SMQ  and  other  ischaemic  heart 
disease  SMQ)  excluding  fatalities,  the  central  nervous  system  haemorrhages  and  cerebrovascular 
conditions SMQ excluding fatalities, and adjudicated CV deaths. To investigate events relating specifically 
to myocardial infarction rather than other cardiac ischaemic events, the narrow MACE definition included 
only  the  PTs  of  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction  and  non-fatal  acute  myocardial  in  addition  to  central 
nervous system haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions SMQ excluding fatalities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/630775/2018 
Page 55/65 
 
  
  
Any  MACEs  (broad  definition)  were  reported  in  133  (3%)  subjects  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group,  in  100 
subjects (2%) in the FF/VI group and in 66 subjects (3%) in the UMEC/VI group. The event rate per 1000 
subject-year was 44.7 in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 35.3 in the FF/VI group and 44.8 in the UMEC/VI group. 
Any  MACEs  (narrow  definition)  were  reported  in  80  (2%)  subjects  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group,  in  60 
subjects (1%) in the FF/VI group and in 37 subjects (2%) in the UMEC/VI group. The event rate per 1000 
subject-year was 22.3 in the FF/UMEC/VI group, 18.8 in the FF/VI group and 22.4 in the UMEC/VI group. 
Overall, although the rate of cardiac adverse events in all groups were low, particularly in the FF/UMEC/VI 
group, the results suggest an additive effect when LABA and LAMA are administered together.  Reports of 
increased  risk  of  such  events  in  patients  with  COPD  who  are  receiving  long-acting  bronchodilators    are 
reported  also  in  the  literature  (e.g.  Wang  MT  et  al.  2018  reported  an  approximate  1.5  fold  increased 
severe CV risk within 30 days after LABA and LAMA  initiation). However at this stage, the CHMP agreed 
that  a  specific  warning  for  an  additive  effect  is  not  warranted  and  the  potential  risk  of  CV  effects  with 
LAMA and LABA use is adequately covered by current class labelling for all age groups.  Additionally, no 
RMP update is considered necessary, however, minor changes have been introduced to the RMP to bring 
it in line with the new template.  
Based on the evaluation of AE data from study CTT116855 six additional ADRs are proposed for inclusion 
in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  label:  bronchitis,  sinusitis,  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  constipation,  dysphonia,  and 
dry  mouth.  In  addition,  changes  in  frequency  are  proposed  for  two  existing  ADRs  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI 
label,  based  on  the  frequency  reported  in  Study  CTT116855:  Candidiasis  of  mouth  and  throat  from 
‘uncommon’  to  ‘common’  and  Oropharyngeal  pain  from  ‘uncommon’  to  ‘common’,  respectively. 
Accordingly, the update of the ADRs section is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
In study 200812, the safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI in the treatment of COPD subjects was similar to that 
of FF/VI+UMEC and consistent with previous data for FF/UMEC/VI in a COPD population. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As described above, the SmPC is updated in order to reflect either new ADRs or changes in frequency of 
ADRs in section 4.8, as well as an update on incidence of pneumonia in the clinical studies based on the 
clinical safety data provided in this application. The changes were considered approvable by the CHMP. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
Minor changes have been introduced to the RMP to bring it in line with the new template (rev. 2). 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

In a 52-week study, with a total of 10,355 patients with COPD and a history of moderate or 
severe exacerbations within the prior 12 months (mean post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 
46% of predicted, SD 15%) (study CTT116855), the incidence of pneumonia was 8% (317 
patients) for Elebrato Ellipta (n = 4,151), 7% (292 subjects) for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
(n = 4,134), and 5% (97 subjects) for umeclidinium/vilanterol (n = 2,070). Fatal pneumonia 
occurred in 12 of 4,151 patients (3.5 per 1,000 patient-years) receiving Elebrato Ellipta, 5 of 
4,134 patients (1.7 per 1,000 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and 5 of 
2,070 patients (2.9 per 1,000 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol. 
Finally the section 5.1 is completely updated with the results of the clinical studies described in this 
application and the results of the PK studies are also included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
As a consequence of this extension of indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient 
groups. These changes are acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant 
condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are 
male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries 
the male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open 
fires. The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence 
and social status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, 
easy, and non-invasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of 
screening for COPD.  Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and 
societal efforts have been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.  
COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and 
hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes 
strain and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of the condition relies on smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with 
bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, 
physical rehabilitation is aimed primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term 
domiciliary oxygen administration is helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are 
suitable for lung volume reduction surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed 
the condition is only partly reversible so more treatment options are always welcome.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main objective of this extension of indication application is to amend the indication of Trelegy Ellipta 
from the currently approved “step-up” indication to a more general maintenance in moderate to severe 
COPD patients thus remove the step up indication. The other changes to the product information are 
ancillary to this main objective, and are based on the results of the three studies summarised in this 
report. 
The  main  phase  3  clinical  studies  supporting  this  application  are  one  pivotal  study  CTT116855  and  one 
supportive study 200812. A population PK report is also provided (study 208059). 
Study  CTT116855  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  study  that  compared  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  FF/UMEC/VI  with  FF/VI  and  UMEC/VI  for  52  weeks  in  subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was 
designed to evaluate the benefit of FF/UMEC/VI over the FF/VI and UMEC/VI dual component medications 
in subjects with advanced, symptomatic COPD and at risk of exacerbation using a primary endpoint of the 
annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations. 
Study 200812 was a randomised, double blind, parallel group study comparing FF/UMEC/VI administered 
in  one  Ellipta  inhaler  with  FF/VI  +  UMEC  administered  in  separate  Ellipta  inhalers  over  24  weeks  in 
subjects  with  COPD.  This  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  FF/UMEC/VI  to 
FF/VI+UMEC using a primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Week 24 with a margin of non-inferiority of 50 
mL 
The population PK analysis (Study 208059) evaluated combined data from a subset of COPD patients that 
participated  in  3  phase  IIIa/b  studies  (CTT116855,  CTT116853,  200812)  to  characterise  the  PK  of  FF, 
UMEC and VI following administration of FF/UMEC/VI from a single Ellipta inhaler and to assess the effect 
of covariates on the PK of FF, UMEC and VI. 
In  Study  CTT116855,  for  the  primary  endpoint  FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant 
reduction  in  the  annual  rate  of  on-treatment  moderate/severe  exacerbations  compared  with  FF/VI  and 
UMEC/VI   [0.91 (0.87-0.95) in FF/UMEC/VI group, 1.07 (1.02-1.12) in FF/VI group and 1.21 (1.14-1.29)  
in  UMEC/VI  group  (p<0.001  for  both  comparisons)].  The  effect  of  FF/UMEC/VI  on  the  annual  rate  of 
moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  was  maintained  when  both  on-  and  off-treatment  data  were 
included in the analysis. For this analysis, FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in 
the annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with FF/VI (11% reduction, p<0.001) 
and UMEC/VI (20% reduction, p<0.001). 
FF/UMEC/VI  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  on-treatment  all-cause 
mortality  compared  with  UMEC/VI  (HR:  0.58;  95%  CI:  0.38,  0.88;  p=0.011,  corresponding  to  a  risk 
reduction  of  42.1%).    For  the  comparison  of  FF/UMEC/VI  and  FF/VI,  the  risk  of  on  treatment  all-cause 
mortality  was  similar  (HR:  0.95;  95%  CI:  0.64,  1.40,  p=0.780,  corresponding  to  a  risk  reduction  of 
5.5%). When both on-and off treatment mortality data were included in the analysis, the significant risk 
reduction in all-cause mortality was maintained for FF/UMEC/VI compared with UMEC/VI. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results of the pivotal trial show that treatment with FF/UMEC/VI results in a significant reduction in 
the number of moderate or severe exacerbations when compared to either FF/VI or UMEC/VI. There were 
also significant improvements in many of the other symptomatic and lung function indices studied in the 
trial as secondary endpoints.

Overall,  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  also  support  the  inclusion  of  symptomatic  and  exacerbation-
related text in the indication, and could be used to justify the use of triple therapy as a step-up from ICS-
containing dual therapy in patients not controlled on dual therapy.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the improvement in terms of exacerbations was statistically significantly higher for FF/UMEC/VI 
compared to the dual combinations (FF/VI and UMEC/VI) the effects were only slightly higher compared 
to  FF/VI.  The  change  compared  to  FF/VI  was  0.16  (model  estimated  exacerbation  rate)  and  for  severe 
COPD exacerbations showed only a difference of 0.02 compared to FF/VI. The clinical significance of the 
differences  seen  for  both  moderate  to  severe  and  severe  exacerbations  is  debatable.  Considering  the 
efficacy  and  safety,  the  MAH  proposed  amendment of  the indication  to  remove  the  step-up indication is 
not  supported  at  this  time  based  on  the  submitted  data.    An  alternative  text  has  been  proposed  and 
accepted, maintaining the step up indication from dual therapies.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects are those associated with the class of active substances. For the LABA tremor, 
tachycardia, agitation, increase of blood pressure, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, for the LAMA  dry 
mouth, blurring of vision, urinary retention, and for the ICS oropharyngeal candidiasis, vocal cord 
atrophy, hyperglycaemia, and most important pneumonia. They can be expected individually and in 
combination.   
Based on the evaluation of AE data from study CTT116855 six additional ADRs are proposed for inclusion 
in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  label:  bronchitis,  sinusitis,  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  constipation,  dysphonia,  and 
dry  mouth.  In  addition,  changes  in  frequency  are  proposed  for  two  existing  ADRs  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI 
label,  based  on  the  frequency  reported  in  Study  CTT116855:  Candidiasis  of  mouth  and  throat  from 
‘uncommon’ to ‘common’ and Oropharyngeal pain from ‘uncommon’ to ‘common’, respectively. 
In study 200812, the safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI in the treatment of COPD subjects was similar to that 
of FF/VI+UMEC and consistent with previous data for FF/UMEC/VI in a COPD population. 
Referring to MACE events, from the submitted clinical data there is no evidence of an additive effect when 
UMEC and VI are administered together. 
In  study  CTT116855,  as  expected  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of  pneumonia  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group 
(298 subjects [7%]) and in the FF/VI group (264 subjects [6%]) compared with the UMEC/VI group (93 
subjects  [4%]).  The  pneumonia  event  rate  per  1000  subjects  were  88.6  in  the  FF/UMEC/VI  group  and 
86.8 in the FF/VI group compared to 57.7 in the UMEC/VI group. The higher risk of pneumonia of about 
35%  comparing  FF/UMEC/VI  with  UMEC/VI  has  to  be  taken  into  account  when  balancing  the  benefit 
against the risk. 
When comparing the FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI groups, the AEs with higher incidences (viral URTI, COPD, 
URTI, and pneumonia) had a similar risk for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI groups. When comparing the 
FF/UMEC/VI and UMEC/VI groups, the risk of COPD was lower for FF/UMEC/VI group while the risk of 
pneumonia and oral candidiasis was lower for UMEC/VI, as expected based on ICS class effects. This 
reflects the known adverse event profile of ICS medications, and has an impact on the substitution 
potential of the triple therapy versus the LAMA/LABA combinations. The update on pneumonia is reflected 
in the SmPC and an updated paragraph is added in section 4.8.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For  patients  at  risk  of  COPD  exacerbations,  the  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease 
(GOLD)  strategy  document  for  the  management  of  patients  with  COPD  recommends  an  incremental 
approach  to  therapy,  beginning  with  either  a  LAMA,  LAMA/LABA,  or  ICS/LABA  therapy  [GOLD,  2017].  If 
patients  develop  further  exacerbations,  escalation  of  pharmacologic  therapy  is  recommended.  For 
example, patients on LAMA therapy can be switched to a LAMA/LABA or ICS/LABA with further escalation 
to triple ICS/LAMA/LABA therapy or those on a dual therapy can be switched to triple therapy if required. 
This  clearly  states  that  triple  therapy  is  currently  thought  to  be  best  used  as  an  escalation  therapy  for 
those incompletely controlled with dual therapy, either ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA. It does not suggest that 
patients  with  moderate  to  severe  COPD  should  be  commenced  on  triple  therapy.  That  being  said,  the 
current  GOLD  guidelines  are  open  regarding  the  evidence  base  on  which  these  recommendations  are 
based.  As  such,  the  MAH  intention  that  triple  therapy  could  be  used  as  a  first  line  is  not  supported, 
however  the  data  support  amendment  of  the  proposed  indication  to  reflect  that  it  should  be  used  as  a 
step up from LABA/LAMA dual therapy. 
Overall,  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  support  the  inclusion  of  references  to  symptomatic  and 
exacerbation-related  text  in  the  indication,  and  could  be  used  to  justify  the  use  of  triple  therapy  as  a 
step-up  from  both  non  ICS-  and  ICS-containing  dual  therapy  in  appropriate  patients.  Although  the 
improvement in terms of exacerbations was statistically significantly higher for FF/UMEC/VI compared to 
the dual combinations (FF/VI and UMEC/VI) the effects were only slightly higher compared to FF/VI. The 
change  compared  to  FF/VI  was  0.16  (model  estimated  exacerbation  rate)  and  for  severe  COPD 
exacerbations  showed  only  a  difference  of  0.02  compared  to  FF/VI.  The  clinical  significance  of  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/630775/2018 
Page 62/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
differences seen for both moderate to severe and severe exacerbations can be debated.  Considering the 
efficacy and safety the proposed amendment of the indication is not supported at this time. An alternative 
text has been agreed as follows: “Trelegy Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately treated 
by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist or a combination of a long-
acting β2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptom control and on 
exacerbations see section 5.1).” 
From a safety point of view, concerns regarding the long-term use of ICS medication are well established. 
These concerns have been reflected in the investigation of newer LABA/LAMA combinations over the 
recent past, and are further reflected in the GOLD guidelines. Amongst other things, pneumonia is 
associated with long-term ICS use, and this adverse event was also found in the clinical studies provided 
by the applicant to support this variation application. Of note, there were significant differences between 
the rates of pneumonia between the FF/UMEC/VI and UMEC/VI groups, whereas there was no difference 
between the FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI groups. This finding suggests that, while there may be a benefit of 
FF/UMEC/VI over UMEC/VI in terms of the effect on exacerbations, this is offset to some degree by the 
increased risk of pneumonia in the former. There was no significant difference in the risk of pneumonia 
between the ICS-containing groups. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trelegy Ellipta is positive as in patients not adequately treated by a combination of a 
long-acting β2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist treatment. The indication is amended as 
follows:    “Trelegy  Ellipta  is  indicated  as  a  maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination 
of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting  β2-agonist  or  a  combination  of  a  long-acting  β2-
agonist  and  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (for  effects  on  symptom  control  and  on 
exacerbations see section 5.1).”

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Remicade, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
The PI contains extensive wording regarding TB, including recommendations that If inactive (‘latent’) 
tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with antituberculosis 
therapy before the initiation of Remicade, and in accordance with local recommendations. There are 
also recommendations to consult with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis, as 
well as to consider anti-TB treatment before start of infliximab treatment also in other situations. 
However, the fact that there have been cases of reactivation of TB despite that the patient has been 
given prophylactic TB treatment is not included in the SPC. Since this is considered an important 
piece of information for the prescriber, section 4.4 should be updated. 
Regarding HSTCL, the cases reviewed during the reporting period did not identify any new safety 
concerns that indicate a change in the safety profile of infliximab. However, the current CCDS 
describes the condition as having been reported only in patients with CD or UC. Given that there are 
cases also in other patient groups that UC and CD, the current wording in section 4.4 and section 4.8 
of the SmPC should be updated.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Remicade, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance infliximab is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

Part VI:   Summary of the Risk management plan 
SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR PEYONA® (CAFFEINE CITRATE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Peyona®. The RMP details important risks 
of  Peyona®,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Peyona® 's risks, and uncertainties (missing information). 
The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information  to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how Peyona® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Peyona® should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Peyona®s RMP.  
I. 
The medicine and what is it used for 
Peyona®  is  authorised  for  treatment  of  primary  apnoea  of  premature  newborns.  It  contains  caffeine 
citrate as the active substance, and it is given by intravenous infusion (loading dose) or by intravenous 
infusion orally (20 mg/ml -maintenance dose). 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Peyona®’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Peyona®  ’s  EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/peyona. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Peyona®, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and product information addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Peyona®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse drug reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including  PSUR  assessment  so that immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Peyona is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A   List of important risks  
Important risks of Peyona® are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Peyona®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine); 
List of important risks  
Important Identified risks: 
•  Toxicity due to maternal caffeine ingestion; 
• 
• 
Increase  in  caffeine  plasma  levels  in  premature  infants  with  cholestatic 
hepatitis; 
Increase  in  caffeine  plasma  levels  in  premature  infants  with  clinically 
relevant renal insufficiency;

Summary of important risks 
II.B 
Important identified risk 
Toxicity due to maternal caffeine ingestion 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Caffeine,  derived  from  that  ingested  by  the  mother,  crosses  the  placenta  and 
caffeine concentrations that are close to therapeutic levels are often found in cord 
blood  at  birth.  Studies  conducted  to  determine  caffeine  present  in  cord  blood 
samples  from  preterm  infants  showed  that  caffeine  can  be  trans-placentally 
acquired  from  mothers  who  ingested  caffeine  McCulloch  KM,  1989;  Soyka  LF, 
1981).  
 
 
 
 
 
Caffeine is rapidly transferred to breast milk. Caffeine ingested by nursing mothers 
appears  in  breast  milk  within  about  15  minutes  in  concentrations  comparable  to 
those in plasma and may comprise up to 4% of the maternal dose Even though the 
ingestion of one cup of coffee (approximately 100 mg of caffeine) by a lactating 
woman  may  not  produce  toxic  effects  in  the  infant,  the  consumption  of  greater 
amounts of caffeine at different times during the day may constitute a risk to the 
infant. 
Infants metabolise caffeine very slowly and could accumulate a significant level of 
caffeine in relation to weight, reaching toxic concentrations (Stavchansky S, 1988; 
Pyu JE, 1985). The mean volume of distribution of caffeine in infants is about 0.8-
0.9 L/kg (Aranda JV, 1979; Gicoia GP, 1989), which is slightly higher than that in 
adults (0.6 L/kg) (Goodman, 1993).  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Neonates born or breastfed by mother heavy drinkers of caffeine.

Increase in Caffeine Plasma Levels in Premature Infants with Cholestatic Hepatitis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In  premature  infants  with  cholestatic  hepatitis  a  prolonged  caffeine  elimination 
half-life with an increase of plasma levels above the normal upper limit of variation 
has been observed. Neonatal hepatitis syndrome is defined as a state in the newborn 
period  where,  as  a  result  of  decreased  bile  flow,  there  is  an  accumulation  of 
substances  in  the  liver,  blood  and  extrahepatic  tissues  which  would  normally be 
excreted  in  bile.  Strictly  speaking  this  implies  elevated  serum  bile  acids,  but  in 
practice it is usually defined by the presence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The 
population incidence of the neonatal hepatitis syndrome is approximately 1:2500 – 
1:5000 live births. The largest diagnostic groups are idiopathic neonatal cholestasis, 
biliary atresia and the multifactorial cholestasis seen in premature infants and those 
requiring  neonatal  surgery  (McKiernan  PJ,  2002;  Fischler  B,  2001;  Roberts  EA, 
2003). 
The  group  of  preterm  babies  with  hepatis  impairments  in  comparison  with 
remaining newborns presented with higher number of ADRs  
What was 22.6 vs. 2.9%, respectively. The  most common ADR was tachycardia 
(Lista G, 2016).  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Premature neonates with cholestatic hepatitis.

Increase in Caffeine Plasma Levels in Premature Infants with clinically relevant renal insufficiency 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Peyona PASS confirmed (Lista G, 2016) the frequency of ADRs in very premature 
infants with renal/hepatic impairment resulted in higher occurrence of at least one 
ADR compared to premature infants without organ impairment. Cardiac disorders, 
specifically tachycardia, were the most common ADRs and SAEs.  
Since  in  the  clinical  practice  a  monitoring  of  the  drug  levels  was  not  routinely 
performed,  in  line  with  the  literature  evidence  (Walther  FJ,  1990),  it  appears 
anyway difficult to clarify a possible correlation between elevated plasma levels 
and the above-described increase in ADRs.   
Risk factors and risk groups 
Premature neonates with renal impairment. 
Risk minimisation measures

Cardiac Disorders in Infants with Pre-existing Cardiac Disease, Including Arrhythmias 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Theophylline  therapy  increases  left  ventricular  output  in  preterm  infants  by  a 
combination  of  positive  inotropic  and  chronotropic  effects.  The  cardiovascular 
effects of caffeine were evaluated in 20 clinically stable preterm infants (Roberts EA, 
2003). Ten infants received intravenous caffeine citrate  with a  loading dose of 20 
mg/kg  and  a  maintenance  dose  of  5  mg/kg  every  24  hours,  and  10  infants  were 
control subjects. Compared with controls, left ventricular output and stroke volume 
were significantly increased on days 1 to 7 of caffeine therapy. Caffeine led to an 
increase in the mean arterial blood pressure on the first 3 days of therapy, but the 
heart rate did not change. These data indicated that caffeine administration leads to a 
significant increase in left ventricular output in preterm infants and that this inotropic 
effect is accompanied by a pressor effect. Other studies have shown that the use of 
caffeine in neonates is associated with tachycardia (Brouard C, 1985; Scanlon JE, 
1985; Romagnoli C, 1992; Larsen PB, 1995; Davis JM, 1986; Lista g, 2016).  
In contrast, the study on 21 premature neonates did not shown any changes in heart 
rate, blood pressure or the autonomic nervous system tone following administration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  caffeine,  nor  were  the  nonlinear  dynamical  properties  of  the  system  altered  by 
caffeine (Shoen K, 2014).  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Premature neonates with existing cardiovascular disease.

Treatment-related Convulsions/Seizures 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
During repeat dose toxicity studies conducted mainly by the oral route effects on 
CNS were seen at high doses. Two publications (Davis JM, 1986; Van den Anker 
JN, 1992) have reported seizures in patients treated with caffeine. Davis reported 2 
cases where the patients developed generalised seizures after the administration of 
caffeine. Both patients had received caffeine for the treatment of SIDS. The first 
case  (a  2.5-month-old  boy)  had  received  a  20  mg/kg IV  loading  dose  and  had a 
caffeine  level  of  13.7  mg/L.  After  2  years  of  treatment  with  phenobarbital,  the 
patient’s  EEG  normalised  as  did  his  neurological  status.  The  second  case  (a  4-
month-old girl) had received an oral loading dose of 20 mg/kg. She was treated with 
anticonvulsants  and  experienced  developmental  delay  and  neurological  deficits 
over the next 2 years. The other report concerned a 33  week infant who received 
caffeine for treatment of apnoea of prematurity. On the second day of treatment, the 
patient presented with tachypnoea, tachycardia, compromised circulation, vomiting 
and convulsions. Serum caffeine level was 346 mg/L. Caffeine was discontinued 
and after 9 days the caffeine concentration was 32.9 mg/L. At 18 months of age the 
follow up psychomotor examination was normal. 
A  systematically  review  of  literature  (Shoen  K,  2014)  confirmed  that  caffeine 
compared with theophylline therapy has been associated with less ADRs in neonatal 
population, including the seizures and hypokalaemia. 
Risk factors and risk groups

Decrease in weight gain / failure to thrive 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In  the  Schmidt  study  (Schmidt  B,  2006),  the  percentage  of  children  admitted  to 
hospital  for  “failure  to  thrive”  was  2.4%.  Again,  the  frequency  was  greater  than 
placebo,  but  not  significantly  so.  No  significant  differences  in  weight  gain  were 
observed between four and six weeks after randomisation. Similarly, no significant 
differences  in  the  mean  weight,  height  and  head  circumference  measures  were 
detected in the five – years follow-up. 
In the Romagnoli study (Romagnoli C, 1992) vomiting and other feeding problems 
occurred in 20% (2/10) of infants treated with 2.5 mg/kg and at 84.6% (11/13) in 
infants  treated  with  5  mg/kg  caffeine.  However,  treatment  did  not  influence  the 
weight curve.  
In the Steer study (Steer P, 2004), there was no significant difference in the incidence 
of feed intolerance between the groups given 5 mg/kg versus those given 20 mg/kg 
(30.6% versus 35.4%) but the percentages were relatively high and increased with 
increased dose. Although the time to regain birth weight was significantly longer for 
infants in the higher dose group (mean ± SD) 14.8 ± 5.3 days versus 12.9 ± 5.0 days 
in  the  lower dose  group;  (p<0.01),  there  was  no difference  in overall  weight  gain 
between the groups for the duration of caffeine treatment as measured by weight on 
cessation. 
In the other Steer study (Steer P, 2003), there was also an increase in the number of 
infants with feeding intolerance in the  15 mg (35.0%)  and 30 mg groups (46.7%) 
compared  with  the  3  mg  group  (31.0%),  although  again  this  was  not  statistically 
significant, and there was no statistically significant difference in weight across the 
groups.

Caffeine withdrawal; 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In some of the studies in infants, subjects were noted to have irritability, excitability 
or other symptoms that are typical of methylxanthine treatment. To the extent that 
infants may become tolerant to such effects, it is conceivable that some of them might 
experience withdrawal effects when caffeine treatment is discontinued. 
The observation period in most trials, including the pivotal study, did not necessarily 
follow  infants  to  the  end  of  their  caffeine  treatment.  In  most  trials,  including  the 
pivotal study, it is not clear how rigorously non-serious adverse events that might be 
markers for a withdrawal syndrome, such as irritability or insomnia, were assessed.  
In one publication (Khanna NN, 2004), eight infants born to mothers who were 
heavy users of caffeine during pregnancy were described. The infants exhibited 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irritability, jitteriness, and vomiting with no cause being identified. Caffeine was 
present in the serum of six infants, and three of the six infants had caffeine in their 
urine. The symptoms resolved spontaneously. It was hypothesised that these infants 
were exposed to high maternal levels of caffeine for the majority of the pregnancy, 
resulting in a withdrawal syndrome after delivery. Another report (Sankaran K, 
2004) described a case of a premature infant with unusually high concentrations of 
transplacental acquired caffeine. The mother drank 24 cups of coffee per day during 
pregnancy. The infant developed apnoea and was started on caffeine therapy. 
Serum caffeine concentration was found to be 40.3 micrograms/ml prior to caffeine 
administration on the fifth day of age. It was suggested that manifestation of apnoea 
in this infant may have been related to caffeine withdrawal.

 Necrotising enterocolitis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Several papers have been published about the use of xanthine therapies in infants at 
risk of NEC. The authors postulated that in these cases, NEC was related to bacterial 
overgrowth due to decreased GI motility which followed the use of xanthines. In 
pre-clinical  studies,  it  was  of  particular  interest  that  mucosal  hypertrophy,  mild 
hyperaemia  and  moderate  inflammation  were  observed  as  dose-dependent 
phenomena in the stomach, small bowel and caecum. In the pivotal trial, two of the 
patients randomised to caffeine developed NEC. In addition, three patients who had 
been exposed to caffeine during the open label phase of the trial developed NEC.  
In the Schmidt trial  (Schmidt B, 2006), however, the rate of NEC did not differ 
significantly between caffeine citrate (63/1006, 6.3%) and placebo (67/1000, 6.7%) 
[AOR  0.94,  95%  CI  (0.65  –  1.34),  P=0.63].  This  data  has  been  more  recently 
confirmed  in  Canadian  study  (Sankaran  K,  2004),  while  the  results  of  a 
retrospective study published in 2014 (Dobson NR, 2014) still suggested that the 
early use of caffeine, besides being associated with improved survival without BPD 
in preterm infants, was indeed associated with an increase in the risk of NEC (OR 
1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.91, p=0.027).   
Finally  available  results  of  a  study  aimed  at  prospectively  comparing  and 
documenting  the  safety  profile  of  the  use  of  extemporaneous  caffeine  citrate  or 
Peyona  in  preterm  infants  with  AOP  have  shown  that  the  extemporaneous 
presentation was, associated with a higher risk of NEC (risk ratio (RR): 2.68, 95% 
CI: 1.01– 7.12, p = 0.047) that the registered product (Vatlach, 2014). 
The findings in the literature are not conclusive as to whether caffeine exposure is 
associated with an increased incidence of NEC, nor if there is a subset of patients 
at a higher risk of developing this disease if exposed to caffeine.

Caffeine  citrate  solution  for  infusion  or  oral  administration  is  authorised  for  the 
treatment  of  primary  apnoea  of  premature  newborns.  There  are  2  formulations 
available which contain 10 mg/mL caffeine citrate or 20 mg/mL of caffeine citrate. 
Care must be taken over which product is being used when dosing with caffeine 
citrate, as confusing the products may cause dosing errors (MRHA, 2013).

Drug interaction with the most commonly used drugs in the NICU 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the 
metabolism of caffeine. Therefore, caffeine has the potential to interact with drugs 
that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2, or induce CYP1A2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk minimisation measures 
Few data exist on PK with caffeine in preterm neonates. Based on adult data, lower 
doses  of  caffeine  may  be  needed  following  coadministration  of  drugs  which  are 
reported  to  decrease  caffeine  elimination  (e.g.,  cimetidine  and  ketoconazole)  and 
higher  caffeine  doses  may  be  needed  following  coadministration  of  drugs  that 
increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin) (Wilson C, 2018).

Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Safety Objective: 
•  To  assess  and  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ 
administered to follow-on subjects approximately 4 to 7.5 years after a 2 dose primary series, with 
that of 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month 
schedule. 
Primary Immunogenicity Objective: 
•  To  assess  serum  bactericidal  activity  at  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  following  a  2  dose  primary 
series (persistence) compared to serum bactericidal activity at baseline in vaccine naïve subjects. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
•  To  assess  the  immune  response  at  1  month  after  a  third  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ 
administered  to  follow-on  subjects  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  after  a  2  dose  primary  series, 
compared to the immune response at 1 month after the first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 
to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule. 
•    To  assess  and  compare  the  changes  over  time  in  the  immune  response  (kinetics)  at  3,  7  and  30 
days  after  a  third  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  administered  to  follow-on  subjects 
approximately 4 to 7.5 years after a 2 dose primary series, with that at 3, 7 and 30 days after the 
second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month 
schedule. 
•  To assess the immune response at 1 month after the second dose (primary series) of rMenB+OMV 
NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives: 
The exploratory immunogenicity objectives are not reported in this CSR and will be reported 
in an addendum when the results are available.  
The  immune  response  to  rMenB+OMV  NZ  may  also  be  evaluated  using  an  additional  panel  of  N 
meningitidis  serogroup  B  strains  (ie,  M14459  (fHbp),  96217  (NadA),  M07-0241084  (NHBA)  and 
NZ98/254, according to the following exploratory objectives. 
•  To  evaluate  serum  bactericidal  activity  at  approximately  4  years  following  a  2  dose  primary  series 
(persistence) in follow-on subjects from parent study V72_41. 
• To evaluate the immune response at 3, 7 and 30 days after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ 
administered to follow-on subjects from parent study V72_41.  
•  To  evaluate  the  immune  response  at  30  days  after  the  first  dose,  and  3,  7  and  30  days  after  the 
second  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  administered  to  Canadian  and  Australian  vaccine  naïve  subjects 
according to a 0, 1-month schedule. 
Study design 
The present study V72_75 was an extension trial from the parent studies V72_41 and V72P10. These 
are 2 key studies in the rMenB+OMV NZ program which enrolled adolescents aged 11 through 17 
years; V72_41 enrolled subjects in Australia and Canada between August and September 2011 while 
V72P10 enrolled subjects in Chile between June 2008 and October 2009. In study V72P10, subjects 
were vaccinated with 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered at a 0, 1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 0, 6 
month schedules. In study V72_41, subjects were vaccinated with 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses 
administered at a 0, 1 month schedule. The studies demonstrated robust response against the vaccine

antigens, absence of major safety concerns and supported the adoption of a 2-dose primary vaccine in 
adolescents with the 2 primary doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered with an interval of at least 1 
month. 
This present study V72_75 was a phase 3b, open label, multicenter, extension study in subjects from 
15 to 24 years of age who were vaccinated with 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at either a 0, 
1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 0, 6 month schedules in study V72P10 and at a 0, 1 month schedule in 
study V72_41. A proportional number of healthy vaccine naïve subjects aged 15 to 24 years were to be 
enrolled at each site to serve as a descriptive comparator for safety, persistence, immune response 
and antibody kinetics of primary immunization with Men B at registered 0, 1 month schedule. 
Data on kinetics of immune response against serogroup B strain would be of particular relevance in 
outbreak management, and vaccination of travelers.

Study population /Sample size 
A  preliminary  feasibility  assessment  suggested  that  400  follow-on  subjects  could  be  available  to 
participate  in  the  present  study  out  of  the  972  subjects  who  participated  in  studies  V72_41  and 
V72P10  and  929  subjects  who  completed  vaccinations  with  rMenB+OMV  NZ  according  to  a  2-dose 
schedule. 
Additionally, approximately 250 vaccine naïve subjects (Groups B1 and B2), of the same age range as 
follow-on  subjects  (approximately  15  to  24  years  of  age)  were  also  to  be  enrolled  into  the  study. 
Vaccine  naïve  subjects  were  to  be  recruited  in  proportion  to  the  expected  recruitment  in  each  of  the 
countries participating in the parent studies. The expected approximate proportion was 5:2:1 for Chile, 
Canada and Australia, respectively. 
In total up to 650 study participants were estimated to take part in this study: 400 follow-on subjects 
and  250  vaccine  naïve  subjects.  A  total of  531  subjects  were  actually  enrolled  into the  study:  276 in 
the follow-on subjects group and 255 in the vaccine naïve group of similar age. 
Overall,  the  sample  size  was  large  enough  to  reflect  important  variations  in  the  population  (see 
confidence intervals [CIs] for the primary endpoints in statistical analysis section), but small enough to 
accommodate  the  operational  constraints  common  to  extension  studies  (follow-on  subjects).  The 
sample  size  for  vaccine  naïve  subjects  allowed  for  an  acceptable  precision  in  the  estimation  of 
immunogenicity  responses,  with  particular  reference  to  kinetics  measurements  at  3  and  7  days 
postvaccination  (at  each  of  those  time  points  only  half  of  all  the  vaccine  naïve  subjects  were  to  be 
assessed)  and  30  days  postvaccination.  The  sample  size  was  also  estimated  to  allow  for  reliable  (> 
90% probability) observation of common (≥ 1%) AEs in the vaccine naïve subjects group. 
From  a  perspective  of  detecting  uncommon  local  or  systemic  AEs,  with  250  subjects  in  the  vaccine 
naïve group, the probability of observing at least one subject with an event for an  underlying rate of

1%  was  92%.  Assuming  400  follow-on  subjects  were  to  be  enrolled,  the  probability  of  observing  at 
least one subject with an event for underlying rate of 1% was 98%. 
Treatments 
•  Follow-on  subjects  (Group  A):  included  up  to  400  eligible  subjects  who  had  received  2  doses  of 
rMenB+OMV  NZ  vaccine  in  the  parent  studies  (V72_41  and  V72P10),  received  no  subsequent 
meningococcal  group  B  vaccines,  and  who  were  to  receive  a  booster  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ 
vaccine  in  the  current  study.  In  study  V72_41,  344  subjects  were  enrolled  to  receive  a  2-dose 
primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 1 month schedule. In study V72P10, 1631 subjects were 
enrolled  to  receive  1,  2  or  3  doses  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  with  different  vaccination  schedules.  Only 
those who received 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered at either a 0, 1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 
0,  6  month  schedules  in  study  V72P10  (ie,  Groups  1a,  2b,  3b  in  parent  study)  and  received  no 
further  meningococcal  vaccine  since  then  were  to  be  invited  to  participate  in  the  extension  study 
V72_75. 
•  Vaccine naïve subjects (Groups B1 and B2): included approximately 250 subjects similar in age to 
subjects  in  the  follow-on  group,  who  had  not  previously  received  any  meningococcal  group  B 
vaccine, and who were to receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, 1 month apart, in the current 
study. On day 1, subjects in this group were to be randomized into 2 different blood draw schedules 
according to a 1:1 ratio, as described in Table 2-2. 
Follow-on subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were to be enrolled in an open label way as shown in 
Table 2-2. 
For follow-on subjects (Group A) the study comprised 4 visits and 1 safety follow-up call for a total of 5 
visits over the course of approximately 1 month during which 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was to 
be administered and 4 blood samples were to be drawn. 
All follow-on subjects were to receive a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ at visit 1. Four blood 
samples were to be drawn from all follow-on subjects at visit 1 (ie, prior to rMenB+OMV NZ dose) and 
at visits 2, 3 and 5 (ie, approximately at 3, 7 and 30 days after the vaccination).

Vaccine naïve subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were to be enrolled in an open label way and 
randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 2 study groups (Group B1 or Group B2) as shown in Table 2-2. No age 
matching procedure between follow-on and vaccine naïve subjects was foreseen, but vaccine naïve 
subjects were to be enrolled in a similar age range as followon subjects, by country. Vaccine naïve 
subjects were to be enrolled at the same sites enrolling follow-on subjects so that vaccine naïve and 
follow-on subjects were drawn from populations of comparable geographical origin. Vaccine naïve 
subjects were to be enrolled in each participating country in proportion to the number of follow-on 
subjects who were expected to take part in this extension study. 
For vaccine naïve subjects (ie, Groups B1 and B2, depending on blood draw schedule) the study 
comprised 4 visits and 2 safety follow-up calls for a total of 6 visits over the course of approximately 2 
months, during which 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine were to be administered and 4 blood 
samples were to be drawn. A total of 3 diary reminder calls were to be performed over the course of 2 
months’ study subject participation. 
All vaccine naïve subjects were to receive a first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at visit 1 and a second dose 
at visit 3 (1 month after the first dose). Four blood samples were to be drawn from all vaccine naïve 
subjects at visit 1 (prior to the first dose) and at visits 3, 4 and 6 (approximately at 1 month after the 
first dose, at 3 days [vaccine naïve Group B1] or 7 days [vaccine naïve Group B2] and 30 days after 
the second dose). 
After receiving vaccination, subjects were to be observed for at least 30 minutes for any immediate 
adverse events (AEs). The subject parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were to be instructed to complete a 
subject diary daily to report solicited local and systemic AEs occurring from the day of each vaccination 
and for the following 6 days as well as to indicate if any analgesic/antipyretic to prevent or to treat 
pain/fever was taken after injection. 
From the day of each injection and for the following 30 days, any unsolicited AE and related medication 
were to be collected. In addition to these safety data, all serious AEs (SAEs), all medications given to 
treat SAEs, and all AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal were to be collected during the entire 
study period, from day 1 (from signature of informed consent) through day 31 (study termination visit) 
for follow-on subjects, or from day 1 through day 61 (study termination visit) for vaccine naïve 
subjects. These data were to be captured through interviewing the subject and/or parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) and by review of available medical records. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Safety Endpoints: 
•  The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  solicited  local  (ie,  injection  site  pain,  erythema, 
swelling, induration) and systemic (ie, fever [temperature ≥ 38.0°C],  high fever [temperature ≥ 
39.5°C],  nausea,  fatigue,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  headache)  AEs  were  to  be  assessed  for  7  days 
(including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination; 
•  The frequencies and percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs for the 30 days (including the 
day of vaccination) after each vaccination. 
•  The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  any  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal,  and 
medically attended AEs throughout the entire study.

•  The persistence of bactericidal activity was measured against N meningitides serogroup B indicator 
strains  H44/76,  5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the 
percentages  of  subjects  with  human  serum  bactericidal  assay  (hSBA)  ≥  1:4  (strains  5/99  and 
NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:16; hSBA geometric mean titers 
(GMTs); and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of GMTs prevaccination versus GMTs at 1 month after 
the  last  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  in  the  V72_41  and  V72P10  studies,  to  each  of  the  4  indicator 
strains. 
Prevaccination  data  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  served  as  a  comparator  to  evaluate  bactericidal 
activity 4 to 7.5 years post-second dose in follow-on subjects. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
•   The immune response was measured against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains H44/76, 
5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  percentage  of  subjects 
with hSBA ≥ 1:4 (strains 5/99 and NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 
1:16; hSBA GMTs, GMRs of GMTs at 1 month postvaccination of a booster dose versus prebooster 
dose  (follow-on  subjects)  or  first  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  versus  pre-first  dose  (vaccine  naïve 
subjects), to each of the 4 indicator strains. 
Post-first  dose  data  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  served  as  a  comparator  to  evaluate  response  to  a 
booster dose in follow-on subjects. 
Additionally,  data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  a  4-fold 
rise at 1 month postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) or first dose (vaccine naïve 
subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ over prevaccination, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator strains. 
•   The  changes  in  serum  bactericidal  activity  over  time  (kinetics)  were  to  be  measured  against  N 
meningitidis  serogroup  B  indicator  strains  H44/76,  5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were 
summarized  by  calculating  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥   1:4  (strains  5/99  and 
NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713; section 9.8), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:16; hSBA GMTs, and 
GMRs of GMTs, at 3, 7, and 30 days postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) versus 
pre-booster  dose  or  second  dose  (vaccine  naïve  subjects)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  versus  pre-second 
dose, to each of the 4 indicator strains. 
Post-second  dose  data  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  served  as  a  comparator  to  evaluate  changes  in 
bactericidal activity over time (kinetics) post-booster dose in follow-on subjects. 
Additionally,  data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  4-fold  rise 
prevaccination compared to 3, 7 and 30 days postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) 
or second dose (vaccine naïve subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator 
strains. 
•  The induction of serum bactericidal activity in vaccine naïve subjects was to be measured against N 
meningitidis  serogroup  B  indicator  strains  H44/76,  5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were  to  be 
summarized  by  calculating  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥   1:4  (strains  5/99  and 
NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713; section 9.8), ≥ 1:8, and ≥ 1:16; hSBA GMTs, and 
GMRs of GMTs at 1 month after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ versus GMTs prevaccination, to 
each of the 4 indicator strains. 
Additionally,  data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  4-fold  rise 
prevaccination  with  a  first  dose  compared  to  1  month  postvaccination  with  a  second  dose  (vaccine 
naïve subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator strains.

The  immune  response  to  rMenB+OMV  NZ  in  both  follow-on  subjects  from  parent  study  V72_41  and 
vaccine  naïve  subjects  from  Canada  and  Australia  might  be  also  assessed  by  measuring  bactericidal 
activity against N meningitidis serogroup B strains M14459, M07- 0241084, 96217, and NZ98/254 as 
follows:

Statistical Methods 
There  was  no  statistical  hypothesis  associated  with  the  immunogenicity  or  safety  objectives.  The 
primary population for each of the immunogenicity associated analysis was to be the following: 
•  Persistence  analyses  for  the  primary  immunogenicity  objective  were  done  using  FAS  (full  analysis 
set).

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/10786/2018  
Page 11/30 
 
 
 
 
 
•  After booster/first dose analyses for the first secondary immunogenicity objective were done using 
FAS. 
•  Assessment  of  the  immune  response  kinetics  was  done  using  PPS  (per-protocol  set).  The 
assessment after 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ in the vaccine naïve group was performed on PPS. 
•  The exploratory analyses in the naïve group were to be performed on the FAS. 
In  analyses  where  the  vaccine  naïve  group  (Group  B1  and  B2)  served  as  a  control  to  the  follow-on 
subjects, adjusted GMTs were computed from a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM 
with  factors  for  vaccine  group  and  country  and  the  ratios  of  GMTs  between  vaccinated  group  and 
vaccine  naïve  group  were  computed  by  exponentiating  (base  10)  the  corresponding  log-transformed 
difference  of  least  square  means  from  the  above  described  model.  In  calculating  the  difference  in 
percentages of subjects with response, the associated CI for the difference was constructed using the 
method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Analyses  were  to  be  performed  on  V72_41  and  V72P10  follow-on  subjects  both  separately  and 
combined. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  531  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study:  276  subjects  were  follow-on  subjects  (145 
subjects from study V72_41 [Australia and Canada] and 131 subjects from study V72P10 [Chile]) who 
approximately  4  or  7.5  years  ago  had  received  2  rMenB+OMV  NZ  primary  series  doses  in  studies 
V72_41 and V72P10. A total of 255 subjects (105 subjects of similar age to those in V72_41 and 150 
subjects  of  similar  age  to  those  in  V72P10)  were  vaccine  naïve  subjects.  All  except  for  1  follow-on 
subject were exposed to the booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ (Table 10.1-1).  
Baseline data 
All  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  follow-on  and  vaccine  naïve 
subjects groups (Table 11.2-1). The mean age of the subjects enrolled into the study V72_41 was 18

± 1.88 years for the follow-on subjects and 17.5 ± 1.85 years for the vaccine naïve group; for study 
V72P10,  the  mean  age  was  21.2  ±  1.73  years  and  21.7  ±  1.56  years,  in  the  respective  groups. 
Among the enrolled subjects, in study V72_41, males were 55% in the follow-on group and 49% in the 
vaccine  naïve  group  while  in  study  V72P10,  males  were  48%  in  the  follow-on  group  and  51%  in  the 
vaccine  naïve  group.  The  race  of  majority  of  subjects  in  study  V72_41  was  categorized  as ‘white’, 
(68%  in  the  follow-on  group  and  70%  in  the  vaccine  naïve  group).  The  race  of  all  of  the  subjects  in 
study  V72P10  was  categorized  as  ‘ other ’ .  Among  the  overall  enrolled  subjects,  99%  met  the 
protocol-defined study entry criteria. 
Immunogenicity results 
Immune Response Persistence - (Primary Immunogenicity Objective) 
Serum  bactericidal  activity  at  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  following  a  2-dose  primary  series 
(persistence) compared to serum bactericidal activity at baseline in vaccine naïve subjects. 
Although  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  antibody  titers  approximately  4  or  7.5  years  after  a  2-dose 
primary  series,  persistence  of  the  immune  response  was  observed  in  the  follow-on  subjects  as 
indicated by: 
•    In  the  follow-on  subjects,  at  approximately  4  or  7.5  years  after  the  2-dose  primary  series  hSBA 
GMTs, although declined (except for strain M10713 in V72_41 subjects) compared to 1 month after

the second primary series dose, were higher than for vaccine naïve subjects of similar age (Table 2-
4). 
•   At  approximately  4  or  7.5  years  after  a  2-dose  primary  series,  for  all  4  indicator  strains  the 
percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4  in  follow-on  subjects  was  higher  (except  for 
strain M10713 in V72P10 subjects) than for vaccine naïve subjects of similar age (Table 2-3).

In the follow-on subjects, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4 and the hSBA GMTs 
after the last vaccination in the parent study were similar at 4 years (V72_41) vs 7.5 years (V72P10) 
across  serogroup  B  indicator  strains,  except  for  the  strain  NZ98/254  for  which  the  titers  were  higher 
(Table 2-3; Table 2-4). 
Across  the  4  serogroup  B  indicator  strains,  the  highest  persistence  was  observed  for  strain  5/99, 
followed by strain M10713, strain H44/76, and strain NZ98/254, in that order (Table 2-3; Table 2-4). 
Assessor’s comment: 
Although  decreasing  for  all  strains  over  time,  immune  persistence  was  observed  4-7.5  years  after 
vaccination  with  2  doses  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  as  demonstrated  by  GMT  ratios  (hSBA)  >  1  for  all  strains 
when comparing vaccinated and vaccine naïve subjects. However, the lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
GMT ratio for M10713 was below 1. 
Of note and as demonstrated with hSBA titers measured in the vaccine naïve population, basal absolute 
GMT titers and rates for hSBA titer ≥ 4 in this population were highest for strain M10713, and there was 
little difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for this antigen. Based on the GMT ratios 
for  hSBA  (vaccinated  individuals/naïve  individuals)  highest  persistence  of  immunogenic  response  was 
reached for strain 5/99 followed by H44/76, and was lowest for NZ98/254 and M10713 (table 2.4).    
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
1) Immune response at 1 month after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ in follow-on 
subjects  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  after  a  2  dose  primary  series  compared  to  the 
immune  response  at  1  month  after  the  first  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  administered  to 
vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.

The immune response to a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in follow-on subjects at approximately 4 or 
7.5  years  after  a  2-dose  primary  series  as  adolescents  was  higher  than  the  response  to  1  dose  of 
vaccine in vaccine naïve subjects of similar age as indicated by: 
•  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4  at  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  in 
follow-on  subjects  were  higher  than  after  a  single  vaccine  dose  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  for  all  4 
indicator  strains,  ranging  across  the  4  strains  from  94%-100%  in  Group  3B  (V72_41)  and  93%-
100%  in  Group  3B  (V72P10).  Comparatively,  at  1  month  following  1  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  in 
vaccine  naïve  subjects,  responses  were  lower,  ranging  from  41%-87%  in  Group  B_0_1  (V72_41) 
and 62%-92% in Group B_0_1 (V72P10) (Table 11.4.1-3). 
•  The hSBA GMTs achieved after booster in follow-on subjects were higher than after a single vaccine 
dose in vaccine naïve subjects for all 4 indicator strains. In V72_41 subjects, the GMRs in follow-on 
subjects ranged from 4.69 (for strain  M10713) to 100 (for strain 5/99) while  the GMRs in vaccine 
naïve  subjects  of  similar  age  ranged  from  2.37  (for  strain  M10713)  to  25  (for  strain  5/99). 
Similarly, in V72P10 subjects, the GMRs in follow-on subjects ranged from 5.16 (for strain M10713) 
to  64  (for  strain  5/99)  while  the  GMRs  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  of  similar  age  ranged  from  2.58 
(for strain M10713) to 16 (for strain H44/76) (Table 11.4.1-4).

•  Similarly, the percentage of subjects achieving at least a 4-fold increase in hSBA titers after booster 
in  the  follow-on  subjects  were  higher  than  after  a  first  dose  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  for  all  4 
indicator strains (Table 11.4.1-5). 
•  Thus, administration of a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in previously primed subjects (follow-on 
group) showed a stronger immune response with higher increase of hSBA titers, as compared to the 
response to a first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in vaccine naïve subjects of similar age, inducing 
an anamnestic response (Table 11.4.1-3; Table 11.4.1-4). 
•  A  booster  dose  administered  4  years  (V72_41)  or  7.5  years  (V72P10)  after  the  last  vaccination 
induced a similar immune response (Table 11.4.1-3; Table 11.4.1-4). 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  rate  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  ≥  4  at  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  in  follow-on  subjects were 
higher than after  a  single vaccine  dose in vaccine naïve subjects for all 4 indicator  strains. The same is 
observed for hSBA GMTs. The GMT ratios following booster compared to first dose indicate the presence 
of immunological memory (Table 11.4.1-4). 
The strongest immune response  as evaluated by hSBA GMTs and an at least 4fold increase of hSBA titers 
reached one month after the booster dose were obtained for strain 5/99 followed by  H44/76 and were 
lowest for  NZ98/254 and  M10713.

days after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 
1 month schedule. 
•   For  all  4  strains,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4  in  follow-on  subjects  3 
days  after  receiving  the  booster  dose  were  similar  to  those  before  vaccination,  highly  increased  7 
days  after  vaccination  and  remained  unchanged  or  further  increased  at  1  month  after  the  booster 
dose (Table 11.4.1-6). In vaccine naïve subjects 3 days after receiving the second vaccine dose, the 
percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4 were similar compared with baseline, increased 
7  days  after  vaccination  except  for  the  strain  M10713  which  remained  similar  to  day  4,  and 
remained unchanged or further increased at 1 month after the second vaccine dose (Table 11.4.1-
6).

•   For all 4 strains, hSBA GMTs in follow-on subjects 3 days after receiving the booster dose remained 
similar  to  those  before  vaccination,  increased  7  days  after  vaccination  and  further  increased  or 
remained high at 1 month after the booster dose. In vaccine naïve subjects 3 days after receiving 
the  second  vaccine  dose  GMTs  also  remained  similar  to  those  at  baseline,  increased  7  days  after 
vaccination and remained high at 1 month after the second dose. For all 4 strains hSBA titers at 1 
month  after  booster  were  higher  than  at  1  month  after  the  second  dose  in  naïve  subjects  (Table 
11.4.1-7).

•   Across serogroup B strains and across vaccine groups, the percentages of subjects with at least 4-
fold increase were higher at 7 days and at 1 month after the booster dose in the follow on subjects 
compared than after the second dose in the vaccine naïve subjects (Table 14.2.1.2.2). 
Assessor’s comment: 
Booster  vaccination  4  to  7  years  after  a  two  dose  vaccination  schedule  with  rMenB+OMV  NZ  led  to 
strong increases of  both  hSBA titers  and hsBA GMTs of all 4 strains as measurable 7  days and 30  days 
later. Best results were obtained for the strains H44/76, 5/99 and M10713 showing proportions of 98-
100%  for  individuals  with  hSBA  titers  ≥  4  after  the  booster  vaccination  (compared  to  94%  for  strain 
NZ98/254). The kinetics of these immune responses is in agreement with persisting immune memory 4-
7.5 years following two priming doses. 
Similar  observations  were  made  when  comparing  the  time  dependent  outcome  before  and  after  the 
second dose of vaccination. Also here, a strong increase in both hSBA titers and hsBA GMTs against all 4

strains  were  measurable  7  days  and  30  days  later,  although  the  increases  were  of  a  lower  magnitude 
compared to the booster dose.   
3) Immune response at 1 month after the second dose (primary series) of rMenB+OMV NZ 
administered  to  vaccine  naïve  subjects  according  to  a  0,  1  month  schedule.  A  robust 
immune response to a 2-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ given 1 month apart was 
observed  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  at  1  month  following  the  first  and  the  second 
rMenB+OMV NZ dose as indicated by: 
•   At  1  month  after  the  first  dose,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4,  ranged 
from  80%  to  88%  across  strains  H44/76,  5/99  and  M10713,  and  was  53%  for  strain  NZ98/254 
(Table 11.4.1-8). The hSBA GMT titers increased 16- and 20–fold over baseline for strains H44/76 
and 5/99, and 5.07- and 2.56-fold over baseline for strains NZ98/254 and M10713, all respectively 
(Table 11.4.1-9).

•   At  1  month  after  the  second  dose,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4, 
ranged  from  93%  to  99%  across  strains  H44/76,  5/99  and  M10713,  and  was  80%  for  strain 
NZ98/254  (Table  11.4.1-8).  The  hSBA  GMT  titers  increased  46-  and  156–fold  over  baseline  for 
strains H44/76 and 5/99, and 11- and 3.23-fold over baseline for strains NZ98/254 and M10713, 
respectively  (Table  11.4.1-9).  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  at  least  a  4-fold  hSBA  titer 
increase  were  95%  and  97%  for  strains  H44/76  and  5/99,  and  were  67%  and  35%  for  strains 
NZ98/254 and M10713, all respectively (Table 11.4.1-10).

Thus,  2  doses  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  vaccine  administered  1  month  apart  to  vaccine  naïve  subjects  15 
through 21 years of age induced an overall robust antibody response against all strains with evidence 
of an early response observed already at one month after the first dose. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Overall, strong immune responses were observed for all 4 strains after the second dose and after booster 
vaccination  as  reflected  in  high  rates  of  individuals  showing  hSBA  titers  of  ≥  4  in  both  cases.  Of  note, 
rates of individuals showing hSBA titers ≥ 4 latest 30 days after the second vaccination remained clearly 
lower for the strains NZ98/254 (79-82%) and M10713 (90-96%) compared to the other two strains and 
the outcome observed after booster vaccination. The lower response of NZ98/254 and M10713 after the 
second vaccination is also reflected in a lower rate of individuals reaching an at least 4 fold increase in 
hSBA titers after the second vaccination compared to the other two strains. 
In general, higher GMTs were reached by booster vaccination compared to the second vaccination dose 
for all four strains. This observation is especially pronounced for strain 5/99 as reflected in both very high 
GMTs and GMRs after the booster vaccination and weakest for strain M10713.  
Safety results 
•   A total of 530 (>99%) subjects out of enrolled 531 subjects were exposed to the study vaccine and 
were included in the overall safety set (Table 12.1-1).

•   Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  in  258  (97%)  follow-on  subjects  and  247  (98%)  vaccine  naïve 
subjects after the first dose and 226 (91%) vaccine naïve subjects after the second dose (Table 2-

12.2.3-1).  Most  of  the  reported  solicited  local  AEs  after  either  dose  of  vaccine  were  mild  to 
moderate in intensity with onset 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination, that resolved within 7 days.

Assessor’s comment: 
The majority of individuals experienced solicited AEs in the included study arms, which were mainly of  
mild  to  moderate  intensity,  and  resolving  within  a  week.    AE  frequencies  were  comparable  between 
individuals obtaining 2 doses of vaccination and individuals obtaining the booster dose. The majority of 
AEs  observed  in  both  groups  of  individuals  were  typical  as  described  for  meningococcal  vaccines 
including local (pain, erythema, induration and swelling) and systemic reactions such as fever, headache, 
arthralgias and myalgias. 
Thus, no new safety concern is detected here. 
• 
Unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  87  (32%)  follow-on  subjects  after  the  booster  dose,  96  (38%) 
vaccine naïve subjects after the first dose and 73 (29%) vaccine naïve subjects after the second 
dose,  with  45  (16%),  58  (23%),  and  43  (17%)  subjects  in  respective  groups  having  at  least 
possibly related unsolicited AEs (Table 2-6).  
The  most  commonly  affected  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  were  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions’  and  ‘infections  and  infestations’  while  the  most  common  unsolicited 
AE  by  preferred  term  were  injection  site  pain  and  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (Table 
12.2.3-3; Table 12.2.3-4). Most of the unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and most 
of them resolved before study termination.

•   One vaccine-naïve subject, after the first dose had AEs (lymphadenopathy and herpangina) leading 
to  premature  withdrawal  from  the  study.  One  vaccine  naïve  subject  had  an  SAE  (severe 
appendicitis)  after  the  first  dose  that  was  considered  as  unrelated  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the 
investigator. 
No death was reported in the study (Table 2-6). 
Assessor’s comment: 
32%  and  38%  of  individuals  reported  unsolicited  AEs  after  the  booster  dose  and  after  the  second 
vaccination, respectively,  with  ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ and ‘infections and 
infestations’ as most commonly affected system organ classes (SOCs) and “injection site pain” and “viral 
upper respiratory tract infection” as most common preferred terms.  
Scrutinization  of  the  AE  related  original  data  submitted  for  the  SOCs  ‘Nervous  system  disorders’  and 
‘Immune  system  disorders’  revealed  diagnoses/PTs  of  more  general  character  including  dizziness, 
headache, paresthesia, involuntary muscle contraction and allergy. 
No deaths were reported. 
In summary no new safety concern arose from the reported unsolicited AEs. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Although clearly falling over time, immune persistence was observed for all 4 strains 4-7.5 years after 
vaccination  with  2  doses  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  as  demonstrated  by  GMT  ratios  (hSBA)  >  1  when 
comparing  vaccinated  and  vaccine  naïve  subjects.  Highest  persistence  of  immunogenic  response  was 
reached for strain 5/99 followed by H44/76, and NZ98/254. Immune persistence for strain M10713 is  
likely a result of high abundant basal GMTs as shown in the vaccine naïve population.  
Strong booster induced immune responses  were observed in individuals treated with the third vaccine 
dose  4-7.5  years  after  dose  1  and  2.  This  is  reflected  in  a  high  proportion  of  subjects  showing  hSBA 
titer ≥ 4 one month after the booster vaccination compared to vaccine naïve individuals treated for the 
first  time  with  the  vaccine.  Strongest  effects  were  reached  for  strain  5/99  and  H44/76,  lower 
immunogenicity was observed for  NZ98/254 and M10713.  
Strong immune responses were also observed after the second dose of vaccination as reflected in high 
rates  of  individuals  showing  hSBA  titers  of  ≥  4  latest  after  30  days.    Of  note,  rates  of  individuals 
showing  hSBA  titers  ≥  4  latest  30  days  after  the  second  vaccination  remained  clearly  lower  for  the 
strains  NZ98/254  (79-82%)  and  M10713  (90-95%)  compared  to  the  other  two  strains  and  to  the 
outcome  observed  after  booster  vaccination.  In  congruence  to  this  observation,  lower  rates  of 
individuals reaching an at least 4 fold increase in hSBA titers after the second vaccination as especially 
seen for NZ98/254 and M10713 after the second vaccination.  
In general, higher GMTs were reached by booster vaccination compared to the second vaccination dose 
for all four strains. This observation is especially pronounced for strain 5/99 as reflected in both very 
high GMTs and GMRs after the booster vaccination and weakest for strain M10713.

No  significant  differences  in  the  principle  antibody  kinetics  1  to  30  days  after  vaccination  were 
observed when comparing the behaviour of antibody titers after the second vaccine dose and after the 
booster  dose.  A  greater  increase  in  GMT  and  response  rates  were  seen  after  the  booster  dose 
compared to the priming doses.  
Reported AEs reflected the known side effect profile of the vaccine. Thus, no new safety concern was 
observed with regard to the solicited and unsolicited AEs reported in the frame of the study. 
In  summary  a  strong  booster  effect  is  observed  by  the  application  of  the  third  dose  on  all  4  strains. 
The  booster  effect  appears  to  be  especially  valuable  for  the  immunogenicity  against  the  strains 
NZ98/254 and M10713, which appear to show the lowest immunogenic response to the vaccine after 
the second dose and the strongest decrease of immune persistence.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
With  the  submission  of  the  current  report  the  commitment  is  considered  fulfilled.  The  MAH  should 
further discuss to what extent these data should be implemented in the SmPC. 
  Fulfilled: 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  further  discussion  to  what  extent  the 
observations  made  with  regard  to  long  persistence  and  effect  of  late  booster  vaccination  should  be 
reflected in the SmPC as part of this procedure. (see section “Additional clarification requested”) 
The  response  of  the  MAH  to  the  question  posed  as  documented  in  section  4  is  endorsed  and  the 
commitment, thus, completely fulfilled. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure: 
The MAH is requested to discuss to what extent the observations made with regard to long persistence 
and effect of late booster vaccination should be reflected in the SmPC.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
The  Company  acknowledges  the  Assessor’s  request  and  would  like  to  inform  the  Agency  that  an 
internal  evaluation  of  the  data  generated  with  the  paediatric  study  V72_75  is  still  on-going.  We  are 
defining  how  the  data  should  be  adequately  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and 
the current plan is to submit a type II variation for Bexsero later this year.

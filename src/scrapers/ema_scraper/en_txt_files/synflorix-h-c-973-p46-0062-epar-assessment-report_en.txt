1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
SPNG-003, A phase II, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to 
assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two formulations 
of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ Streptococcus pneumoniae protein 
containing vaccine given as a 3-dose primary vaccination course 
coadministered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine during the first 6 months 
of life and as a booster dose at 12-15 months of age. 
Methods 
Objectives 
First primary objective 
• 
To support that GSK Biologicals’ candidate pneumococcal protein-containing vaccine (dPly 10 
μg and PhtD 10 μg), when administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course, is non-inferior 
to GSK Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (10Pn-PD-DiT), when 
coadministered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in infants, in terms of post-primary 
immunization febrile reactions with fever > 40.0° C (rectal temperature) with causal 
relationship to vaccination. 
Second primary objective (sequential) 
• 
To support that GSK Biologicals’ candidate pneumococcal protein-containing vaccine (dPly 30 
μg and PhtD 30 μg), when administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course, is non-inferior 
to GSK Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (10Pn-PD-DiT), when 
coadministered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in infants, in terms of post-primary 
immunization febrile reactions with fever > 40.0° C (rectal temperature) with causal 
relationship to vaccination. 
Criteria for safety: 
Non-inferiority was supported if one could rule out an increase, in terms of percentage of subjects with 
fever > 40.0°C (rectal measurement) with causal relationship to vaccination (10Pn+Proteins group as 
compared to 10Pn group) above 5% + half the incidence in the control group (= null hypothesis) as 
shown by a one-sided p-value < 5%. 
Note: the second primary objective was assessed sequentially: it was not possible to conclude on the 
second primary objective if the first primary objective could not be demonstrated. 
Secondary 
• 
To compare the protein doses (10 μg-10 μg or 30 μg-30 μg) contained in GSK Biologicals' 
candidate pneumococcal protein-containing vaccine when given as a 3-dose primary 
vaccination course to infants and co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, in terms of 
post-dose 3 immune response. 
Criteria for superiority: 
Superiority of one formulation over the other was demonstrated if the upper limit (UL) of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio between the 10vPP30 group 
EMA/CHMP/621236/2016 EMA/713031/2016 
Page 3/17 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and the 10vPP10 group was below 1.0 for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations OR if the UL 
of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio between the 10vPP10 group and the 10vPP30 group was below 1.0 for 
anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations.

Statistical Methods 
Safety and reactogenicity 
The primary safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort (TVC). 
Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
•  Standardized asymptotic 95% CIs for the difference between groups (10Pn+Proteins groups 
minus 10Pn group) in terms of percentage of subjects reporting fever > 40.0°C (rectal 
temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination after the primary vaccination schedule. 
The one-sided p-value for the null hypothesis, i.e. that the increase in the percentage of subjects with 
fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination (10Pn+Proteins groups as 
compared to 10Pn group) would be above 5% + half the incidence in the control group, was also 
computed. 
EMA/CHMP/621236/2016 EMA/713031/2016 
Page 6/17 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The first primary objective would be reached if the p-value is below 5%, when considering 10vPP10 
group. The sequential second primary objective would be reached if the first primary objective is 
reached and if the p-value, when considering 10vPP30 group, is below 5%. 
Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
• 
The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE during the 
7- day (Days 0-6) solicited follow-up period was tabulated for each group, after each vaccine 
dose and overall primary doses, with exact 95% CI. The percentage of doses followed by each 
individual solicited local and general AE during the 7-day (Days 0-6) solicited follow-up period 
was tabulated for each group, over the full primary vaccination course, with exact 95% CI. The 
same tabulation was performed for grade 3 solicited AEs and for solicited AEs with causal 
relationship to vaccination. For redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also tabulated. 
Occurrence of fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments. All the above tabulations 
for each individual solicited AE were also performed for the first 4 days after each vaccination 
(Days 0-3). 
• 
The proportion of subjects/doses with at least one report of unsolicited AE classified by the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reported up to 30 days after primary 
or booster vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group. The same tabulation 
was performed for grade 3 unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs with a relationship to 
vaccination. 
•  SAEs and withdrawal(s) due to SAE(s) were described in detail. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) 
and on the TVC. 
Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
•  95% CIs for the antibody GMC ratios (10vPP30 group over 10vPP10 group and 10vPP10 group 
over 10vPP30 group), one month after the third dose of the primary immunization course, 
were computed for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations. 
First secondary objective would be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio between 
the 10vPP30 group and the 10vPP10 group was below 1.0 for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody 
concentrations OR if the UL of the 95% CI for GMC ratio between the 10vPP10 group and the 10vPP30 
group was below 1.0 for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations. 
Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
At each timepoint that a blood sample result was available and for each group: 
•  Geometric mean concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated for each 
serotype*/antigen 
•  Seropositivity/seroprotection rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for each appropriate 
serotype*/antigen 
•  Vaccine response rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for HBs antigen. 
Note: investigations on the quality of some serology assays revealed that the anti-HBs ELISA 
overestimated concentrations between 10-100 mIU/mL while values > 100 mIU/mL were confirmed 
valid. Therefore, all available samples at the one month post-dose 3 timepoint for which the anti-HBs 
EMA/CHMP/621236/2016 EMA/713031/2016 
Page 7/17 
 
 
  
 
 
 
antibody concentration was between 10-100 mIU/mL by in-house ELISA were retested by the 
commercial assay Centaur™, an FDA-approved and CE-marked CLIA with a cut-off defining 
seropositivity of 6.2 mIU/mL. Anti-HBs seroprotection was redefined as in-house ELISA concentration 
> 100 mIU/mL or CLIA concentration > 10 mIU/mL. 
•  Vaccine response/booster vaccine response rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for each 
pertussis antigen. 
• 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each appropriate serotype*/antigen was 
displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCCs). 
*Note that opsonophagocytic activity against the vaccine-related serotype 19A will be measured with a 
multiplex OPA and results will be presented in an Annex Report when available. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
This multicentre study was conducted in 24 centres in 4 countries: Czech Republic, Germany, Poland 
and Sweden. A maximum of 104 subjects (18.1%) were enrolled in a single study centre (in Czech 
Republic). 
Out of the 575 subjects vaccinated in this study, 564 completed this study and 11 were withdrawn. 
Among those: 
•  One subject from the 10Pn group was withdrawn due to an SAE (hypotonichyporesponsive 
episode) occurring during the primary epoch. 
•  One subject from the 10Pn group did not participate in the booster epoch due to an SAE 
(psychomotor retardation) occurring during the primary epoch. 
•  One subject from the 10vPP30 group was withdrawn due to an SAE (type I diabetes mellitus) 
occurring during the booster epoch. 
Thus, the TVC for the primary epoch included 575 subjects (146 in the 10vPP10 group, 142 in the 
10vPP30 group, 145 in the 10Pn group and 142 in the Prev13 group). Out of these, 558 subjects 
(97.0%) met the eligibility criteria for the inclusion in the ATP cohort for safety for the primary epoch. 
537 subjects (93.4%) were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity for the primary epoch. 
Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity results: 
Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
The first secondary objective to compare the protein doses contained in the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 
and 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccines was reached. The superiority of 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 
vaccine over the 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 vaccine in terms of post-dose 3 immune responses to Ply 
and PhtD pneumococcal proteins was demonstrated as the ULs of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio 
(10vPP10/10vPP30) for anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibodies were below 1 (UL of 95% CI were 0.98 for 
anti-Ply and 0.94 for anti-PhtD).

Assessor’s comment: The immune responses to the 10 vaccine serotypes following vaccination with 
Synflorix were in agreement with previously reported results, and do not cause concern regarding 
immunogenicity. 
Safety results 
Between group assessment (confirmatory analysis) 
No fever > 40.0°C (rectal temperature) considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
primary vaccination was reported in any of the 4 study groups. 
Within group assessment (descriptive analysis) 
Primary epoch 
During the 7-day post-primary vaccination period: 
Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom at the pneumococcal vaccine 
injection site (reported after 37.2%, 38.1%, 33.6% and 34.5% of doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 
10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively). No more than 2.7% of doses were followed by grade 3 solicited 
local symptoms of given category, in each group. 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (reported after 55.5%, 55.5%, 
55.0% and 56.6% of doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively). General 
symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were reported after a 
maximum of 43.6%, 43.1%, 41.8% and 41.5% of doses (irritability) in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn 
and Prev13 groups, respectively. No more than 4.8% of doses (irritability) were followed by grade 3 
general solicited symptoms in each group and most of them were considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to vaccination. 
EMA/CHMP/621236/2016 EMA/713031/2016 
Page 15/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
No increase in the incidence of solicited local and general symptoms was observed with consecutive 
doses of either 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 10 or 10Pn-PD-DiT-dPly-PhtD 30 vaccines, during the 3-dose 
primary vaccination course. 
During the 31-day post-primary vaccination period: 
At least one unsolicited symptom was reported after 16.9%, 21.4%, 20.1% and 20.0% of doses in the 
10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 group, respectively. 
Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported after 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.2% of doses in the 10vPP30, 
10Pn and Prev13 group, respectively. Of these, one grade 3 symptom (hypotonic-hyporesponsive 
episode in one subject in the 10Pn group) was considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination. 
Unsolicited symptoms considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were 
reported after 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.2% of doses in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 
groups, respectively. 
Booster epoch 
During the 7-day post-booster vaccination period: 
The most frequently reported solicited local symptoms at the pneumococcal vaccine injection site were 
redness in the 10vPP10 and 10Pn groups (reported for 47.9% and 41.0% of subjects, respectively) 
and pain in the 10vPP30 and Prev13 groups (reported for 45.7% and 44.3% of subjects). No more 
than 5.7% of subjects were reported with grade 3 solicited local symptoms of given category, in each 
group. 
Rates of pain for both 10vPP10 and 10vPP30 investigational groups seem to be higher after booster 
dose than after primary doses of the same vaccines; however similar observation can be made for the 
control 10Pn and Prev13 groups. 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (reported for 66.0%, 60.0%, 
59.0% and 64.3% of subjects in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively). 
General symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were reported for 
a maximum of 59.7%, 58.6%, 54.7% and 59.3% of subjects (irritability) in the 10vPP10, 10vPP30, 
10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively. No more than 8.3% of subjects (irritability) were reported with 
grade 3 general solicited symptoms in each group and most of them were considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
For some solicited general AEs (e.g. loss of appetite and fever), a trend for higher rate of symptoms 
reported after booster dose when compared to the last primary dose can be observed; however similar 
observation can be made for the control 10Pn and Prev13 groups. 
During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period: 
At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 27.8%, 18.6%, 19.3% and 24.3% of subjects in the 
10vPP10, 10vPP30, 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively. 
Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported for 1.4% and 2.1% of subjects in the 10vPP10 and 
Prev13 groups, respectively. None were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination.

Unsolicited symptoms assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were reported 
for 1.4% and 0.7% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev13 groups, respectively. 
No fatal SAEs were reported during the entire study period. At least one non-fatal SAE was reported 
for 56 out of 575 subjects during the primary epoch and for 4 out of 564 subjects during the booster 
epoch. 
One SAE (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in one subject in the 10Pn group on the day of 
vaccination dose 1) was assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All events 
recovered/resolved by the time of study end, except for 4 events (2 cases of psychomotor retardation, 
type I diabetes mellitus and thermal burn). 
During the primary epoch, one subject from the 10Pn group was withdrawn from the study due to a 
SAE (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode). During the booster epoch, 2 subjects were withdrawn from 
the study due to an SAE (psychomotor retardation in the 10Pn group and type I diabetes mellitus in 
the 10vPP30 group). 
Assessor’s comment: The safety results were in agreement with previous studies, and no new safety 
concern was raised.  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a clinical study of a new pneumococcal candidate vaccine, in which Synflorix 
was one of the comparators. The immunogenicity and safety results for the Synflorix group were in 
agreement with previous studies, and no new concerns are raised.

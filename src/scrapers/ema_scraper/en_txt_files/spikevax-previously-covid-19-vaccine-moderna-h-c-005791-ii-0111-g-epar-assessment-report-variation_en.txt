2.  Introduction 
Moderna developed the Spikevax vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 
virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigens encoded in RNA 
and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple 
mutations have led Moderna to develop variant vaccine constructs. 
There are several approved formulations of Spikevax vaccine targeting the Wuhan (original) strain, and 
Omicron BA.1 and BA.4-5. 
To assist in the continued management of COVID-19, and taking into account the ECDC-EMA statement 
on updating COVID-19 vaccines composition for new SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, a new Omicron 
(XBB.1.5) monovalent variant vaccine is the subject of this variation. 
3.  Quality aspects 
3.1.  Introduction 
The monovalent finished product is presented as a dispersion for injection containing 100 micrograms/mL 
of andusomeran as active substance, embedded in lipid nanoparticles. The finished product is a white to 
off-white sterile dispersion for injection in a preservative-free buffer at pH 7.5 for intramuscular 
administration.  
Andusomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro 
transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 
(Omicron XBB.1.5). 
Other ingredients are: SM-102 (heptadecan-9-yl 8-{(2-hydroxyethyl)[6-oxo-6-
(undecyloxy)hexyl]amino}octanoate), cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC, 
1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000- DMG), trometamol, 
trometamol hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose and water for injections 
The product is available in six presentations:  Spikevax XBB.1.5 0.1 mg/mL dispersion for injection (2.5 
mL multidose glass (EU/1/20/1507/011) or cyclic olefin polymer (EU/1/20/1507/012) vials, both in pack 
sizes of 10 vials), Spikevax XBB.1.5 50 micrograms dispersion for injection (0.5 mL single dose glass vials 
in pack sizes of 1 (EU/1/20/1507/013) and 10 vials (EU/1/20/1507/014)) and Spikevax XBB.1.5 50 
micrograms dispersion for injection in a pre-filled syringe (0.5 mL single dose in pack sizes of 1 
(EU/1/20/1507/015) and 10 syringes (EU/1/20/1507/016)). 
3.2.  Active substance – andusomeran 
General information  
To introduce the new monovalent vaccine, the MAH submitted data to support implementation of the 
omicron variant XBB.1.5 mRNA (CX-038839) manufacture. 
CX-038839 (INN; andusomeran) is the mRNA that encodes for the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein for 
2023-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) XBB.1.5 variant. The XBB.1.5 sub variant is a sub-lineage of the 
Omicron variants. XBB.1.5 is a recombinant of two BA.2 sub-lineages, with an additional spike receptor-

binding domain (RBD) change, S486P. The S protein is stabilized in the so-called pre-fusion conformation 
by two amino acid mutations, K982P and V983P. 
CX-038839 mRNA is chemically identical to naturally-occurring mammalian mRNA with the exception that 
the uridine nucleoside normally present in mammalian mRNA is fully replaced with N1-
methylpseudouridine, a naturally-occurring pyrimidine base present in mammalian tRNAs. This nucleoside 
is included in the CX-038839 mRNA in place of the normal uridine base to minimize the indiscriminate 
recognition of CX-38839 mRNA by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors (e.g., Toll-
like receptors). The molecular sequence of CX-038839, including the 5′cap, the 5′untranslated region 
(UTR), the Open Reading Frame (ORF), the 3′UTR, and the 3′polyA tail, is provided. 
The full sequence of CX-38839 is provided. The 3’UTR for CX-038839 mRNA has been modified with a 24 
nt substitution of an 11 nt sequence in the original 3’UTR used in CX-024414 mRNA. This sequence is 
referred to as the identity and ratio (IDR) sequence. The IDR sequence corresponds to position 3943-
3966 in the CX-038839 mRNA sequence. 
The information on the structure of mRNA CX-038839 is considered acceptable.  
Manufacture  
The active substance is manufactured by Lonza AG (Lonzastrasse, 3930 Visp, Switzerland), ModernaTX, 
Inc. (One Moderna Way, Norwood, MA 02062, USA) and Lonza Biologics, Inc. (101 International Drive 
Portsmouth, NH 03801, USA) 
No new manufacturing sites were introduced with this submission for drug substance and all hold 
appropriate GMP authorisations. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The nominal manufacturing batch size for CX-038839 mRNA at Lonza AG (Visp, Switzerland) and at 
ModernaTX (Norwood, United States) is 75 L (Scale B) in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction volume. The 
manufacturing process for CX-038839 is identical to the manufacturing process presented for CX-024414 
at the 75 L scale at Lonza Visp and at ModernaTX Norwood, respectively. 
Control of materials  
Raw materials: 
The raw materials used in the manufacture of CX-038839 are identical to the raw materials used for 
manufacture of CX-024414 (elasomeran, original strain). 
Starting material: 
The starting materials in the manufacture of CX-038839 mRNA are the linearized plasmid template and 
the nucleotides ATP, CTP, GTP, N1-Me-ΨTP. The nucleotides are the same nucleotides as used for 
manufacture of CX-024414 mRNA. 
Linearized Plasmid Template: 
A unique linearized DNA plasmid template specific for CX-038839 mRNA was manufactured at 
ModernaTX, Inc. (Norwood, MA, USA). The features of the plasmid template specific for CX-038839 mRNA 
are consistent with CX-024414 mRNA described in Section 3.2.S.2.3 {CX-024414 - Starting Materials - 
Lonza Visp} and Section 3.2.S.2.3 {CX-024414 – Starting Materials - US - ROW}, with the exception of 
the specific sequence of the coding region and the 3’UTR. In addition to the elements described for the 
3’UTR of CX-024414, the 3’UTR for CX-038839 mRNA has been modified with a 24 nt substitution in an 
11 nt region of the original 3’UTR used in CX-024414 mRNA. This sequence is referred to as the identity 
and ratio (IDR) sequence, to enable identification and relative ratio determination of individual RNA

components in a bivalent Drug Product. Introduction of the IDR in the 3’UTR enables analytical control 
using RNAse H guides specifically targeting to the IDR for each RNA and offers the flexibility and 
efficiency for analytical control of future variant vaccines. These proposed sequences are non-coding and 
would therefore not be translated into peptides. 
The full plasmid DNA sequence and the plasmid map are provided. The host cell line used for manufacture 
of PL-034023 for CX-038839 mRNA is the same as described for CX-024414 mRNA. 
The cell banking system is two-tiered, including a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB). 
The manufacturers involved in cell bank production are listed. Manufacture and testing of MCB and WCB 
was conducted as for the original CX-024414 containing plasmid. 
Release results for MCB and WCB are provided including for culture purity, lytic and lysogenic 
bacteriophages, viability, marker retention, strain identity (for MCB only), plasmid identity, plasmid 
integrity and plasmid copy number. The analytical procedures used to perform release are also stated. 
Qualification of MCB and WCB have also been described. 
The MCB stability protocol and all available data are provided. The test methods and acceptance criteria 
are the same as for release testing. All available data show compliance to specification.  
PL-034023 is manufactured for CX-038839 mRNA using the same procedure as described for CX-024414 
mRNA. The same approach to characterization testing and kanamycin risk assessment described for CX- 
024414 mRNA was taken for CX-038839 mRNA.  
The specification for the linearized plasmid includes: appearance, concentration, plasmid identity, %linear 
plasmid, residual genomic DNA, residual RNA, residual protein, bacterial endotoxin and bioburden. 
The final filtered bulk long-term storage condition for the linearized plasmid is -25°C to -15°C, with a 
formal shelf life of three years. 
A shelf life of 3 years at -25°C to -15°C is requested for the linearized plasmid based on the prototype 
vaccine and supported by limited data collected in an on-going stability study. Considering that no 
changes are included in the manufacturing process of the DNA template as compared to the original 
variant, the shelf-life is considered sufficiently supported by the original data.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The process control strategy and methods for critical in-process controls testing for the CX-038839 mRNA 
manufacturing process are identical to the ones in place for the CX-024414 mRNA (elasomeran). 
Process validation and/or evaluation  
For mRNA-1273 variant processes that use a manufacturing process and control strategy equivalent 
(equivalent except for mRNA sequence specific control elements) to the prototype mRNA-1273 process 
(i.e. the Original CX-024414), one confirmatory PPQ verification lot was performed to demonstrate 
process consistency per site per the requirements specified in the Process Validation Master Plan . The 
applicant has successfully completed PPQ verification of the CX-038839 mRNA manufacturing process as 
a means of demonstrating that the commercial-scale manufacturing process is capable of consistently 
delivering quality product. The PPQ verification has generated data at commercial scale to support and 
complement laboratory-scale studies. 
All process trains previously qualified for CX-024414 manufacture are also considered qualified for 
commercial production of CX-038839. 
All discrete process parameters defined were evaluated during PPQ verification for conformance to their 
target ranges and are summarized. The results of the CPP, PP, critical and non-critical IPC and release

testing of the CX-038839 mRNA PPQ verification batch were within the specifications and the prior 
defined acceptance criteria. The process performance verification at Moderna TX Norwood and Lonza Visp 
was completed successfully.   
Manufacturing process development  
The development of additional mRNA-1273 vaccines was initiated in response to the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2 variants of concern. Sequences for mRNA-1273 vaccines are designed upon the prefusion-
stabilized two-proline (S-2P) encoding sequence for CX-024414 mRNA. Changes relative to this sequence 
are made to incorporate the specific mutations of the variant S protein sequence encoded by the 
sequence of the specific mRNA-1273 RNA. The manufacturing process and process and analytical control 
strategies established for the CX-024414 mRNA are applied directly to CX-038839 mRNA. 
Subsequent process characterization beyond that described for CX-024414 was performed for CX-038839 
mRNA (XBB.1.5), with the intent of verifying the applicability of the process description and process 
control strategy defined. CPPs and the CIPC are consistent between CX-038839 mRNA (XBB.1.5) and CX-
024414 mRNA. 
A comparability study between CX-024414 to CX-038839 was conducted.  
The following three elements were included in the comparability study: 
• Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-
process controls (IPCs). 
• Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
• Statistical evaluation of selected extended characterization results.  
The mRNA sequence was the only change represented in this comparability exercise. All CIPC and IPC 
results met the acceptable ranges. Release results met both specification and comparability acceptance 
criteria and extended characterization results met the comparability expected ranges. Therefore, the 
results from the Scale B (75 L IVT scale) PPQ lot of CX-0338839 mRNA manufactured at ModernaTX 
(Norwood, MA) and from the Scale B (75 L IVT scale) PPQ verification lot of CX-038839 mRNA 
manufactured at Lonza (Visp, Switzerland) demonstrated that the pre-change and post-change 
manufacturing processes and quality attributes were comparable. The comparability data clearly indicates 
that the quality of the CX-038839 mRNA is comparable to the quality of the parental CX-024414 mRNA, 
as all testing is within the comparability acceptance criteria.  
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
The structure, physicochemical properties of CX-034476 mRNA, were studied using a variety of 
techniques applicable to mRNAs. The data generated from these analyses confirm the physico-chemical 
structure and characterize the functional attributes of CX-038839 mRNA. This was studied by techniques 
applicable to mRNAs, including: determination of UV extinction coefficient, circular dichroism spectrum, 
reverse transcription followed by Sanger di-deoxynucleotide sequencing, oligonucleotide mapping, N1-
methyl-pseudouridine (N1-MeΨU) ID and content, cap identity, Poly A tail length and dispersity, sequence 
homogeneity of the CX-038839 mRNA coding region, melting profile by Differential Scanning Calorimetry 
(DSC). Process impurities were evaluated. These included double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and residual 
protein. The characterization of the new mRNA CX-038839 is considered acceptable.

EMA/429527/2023 
Page 8/48 
 
 
 
 
 
Impurities 
There are no new impurities as compared to parental mRNA. 
Control of active substance 
The following attributes have been included in the specification for the active substance: appearance, 
mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger sequencing, total RNA content by UV, purity and product 
related impurities by RP-IP-HPLC, % 5’ capped and Poly A tailed RNA, pH, bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 
2.6.14) and bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12). 
No change in the specification is proposed. The specifications for CX-038839 and CX-024414 are 
identical, except for the specification for identity by reverse transcription / Sanger sequencing and a 
product-specific justification for this has been provided. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for release testing of CX-038839 and prototype CX-024414 are identical with 
the exception of the identity method, since this is the only method that is sequence-specific. Confirmation 
of mRNA Sequence by RT-PCR and Sanger Sequencing has been validated and shown to be suitable for 
the purpose of determining the mRNA identity of CX-038839.  
Batch analysis 
Batch results from one batch produced at Moderna Norwood and one batch produced at Lonza Visp are 
presented and the CoAs are provided. The results show compliance to specifications. 
Reference standards of materials  
The CX-024414 mRNA reference material is used as a reference standard for measurement of total RNA 
content of variant mRNA-1273 LNP and DP materials including mRNA-1273.815 LNP and DP. It is also 
used as a system suitability standard for several release tests. 
Assays such as %PolyA tailed variants, use a relative measurement of a specific peak of interest (such as 
a PolyA tail peak) relative to a total peak area within the same test sample to report results. The 
measurement of purity and product-related impurities by ion pairing reversed-phase chromatography 
uses a similar approach, where the purity and impurity peaks are measured in relation to the total peak 
area within a sample chromatogram. In both cases, a product-specific reference standard is not needed 
to measure the attributes of interest. To assess the system performance parameters such as peak area or 
retention time consistency within the run as system suitability, any standard that chromatographs 
similarly to the analyte of interest can be used, and a product-specific reference standard is not 
necessarily needed. In the case of the RP IP HPLC purity method, a single mRNA standard (CX-024414) is 
used to assess system suitability. 
The justification that no sequence specific reference material is needed as it is used as system suitability 
reference material only is acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for CX-038839 mRNA is the same as for the original prototype, CX-024414 
mRNA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 9/48 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability  
An initial shelf-life of 36 months is proposed as from the time of freezing for CX-038839 mRNA material 
stored in the commercial container closure system. The CX-038839 mRNA is stored at -60 to -90°C, after 
an optional interim storage at -15 to -25°C of maximum 3 months.  
The properties of CX-038839 mRNA with respect to the attributes that affect product potency have been 
assessed. These attributes include fidelity of the RNA sequence including cap, tail, and open reading 
frame, and integrity of the RNA. Direct measurements of those attributes have been established and are 
included in the routine release panel for CX-038839 mRNA. The product quality attribute expected to 
change most during the manufacturing and distribution of the product is mRNA purity, which represents 
the fraction of intact mRNA. The degradation of RNA in the product has been extensively studied by 
applying a sensitive chromatographic assay to assess the formation of RNA degradants. The principal 
route of degradation for RNA is hydrolytic chain scission to species that elute prior to the main peak (RNA 
fragments). mRNA purity correlates with protein levels measured in the in vitro relative protein 
expression assay. Direct measurement of RNA degradation utilizing the RNA purity assay by RP-HPLC is 
precise, accurate, and the most stability-indicating measure of product activity. 
Stability studies have been initiated for CX-038839 mRNA manufactured at ModernaTX, Inc. (Norwood, 
MA) and at Lonza (Visp, Switzerland). Upon request, the applicant has committed to submit a revised 
Section 3.2.S.7.2 {CX-038839} by the end of September 2023 to reflect the shelf-life claim, including the 
optional interim storage at -25°C to -15°C in the annual stability protocol (recommendation 1). 
3.3.  Finished product intermediate mRNA LNP 
CX-038839 mRNA loaded LNP intermediate (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B) 
The process description and in-process controls for the mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B remain identical to the 
ones previously approved for the mRNA-1273 LNP-B and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B materials. Error! 
Reference source not found. 
Since the same manufacturing process is used; one single Process Verification / Comparability batch was 
performed to introduce the mRNA-1273.815LNP-B manufacturing on the already approved Moderna 
Norwood, Lonza Visp and Rovi Granada manufacturing sites. 
Raw materials used in the manufacturing process of mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B are the same as those used 
in the manufacturing process of the other LNPs. 
The specifications have not been changed for the newly introduced mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B. 
Considering the mRNA LNP stability is sequence agnostic; the same degradation kinetics apply to all 
mRNA-LNP-B materials and the shelf-life of 12 months when stored at -90°C to -60°C, as previously 
assigned to the mRNA LNP-B material, is therefore assigned to the mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B material. 
Pharmaceutical development  
As for the existing formulation, the manufacturing process for the finished product intermediate 
comprises the manufacture of an mRNA loaded LNP intermediate, i.e. mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B (containing 
mRNA CX-038839).  
CX- 038839 mRNA loaded LNP intermediate (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B) 
The development of additional mRNA-1273 vaccines was initiated in response to the emergence of SARS-
CoV-2 variants of concern. Sequences for mRNA-1273 vaccines are designed based upon the S-2P

encoding sequence for CX-024414 mRNA. Changes relative to this sequence are made to incorporate the 
specific mutations of the variant S protein sequence encoded by the specific mRNA-1273 RNA sequence. 
The manufacturing process and process and analytical control strategies established for mRNA-1273 LNP-
B are applied directly to mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B. 
Subsequent process performance verification beyond that described in Section 3.2.S.2.6 {mRNA-1273 
LNP} was performed for mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B (Omicron XBB.1.5), with the intent of verifying the 
applicability of the process description and process control strategy. 
The following three elements were included in the comparability study: 
1.  Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-
process controls (IPCs). 
2.  Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
3.  Statistical evaluation of extended analytical characterization testing results. 
Three PPQ batches have been included in the comparability study.  
The comparability study was performed using the PPQ batch data from mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B and 
historical batch data. Historical data from development, clinical, Scale A, preliminary Scale B, and Scale B 
mRNA-1273 LNP batches were used to define comparability acceptance criteria. Comparability covered 
data on process performance parameters and in-process controls, results of release testing, and results of 
extended characterisation. Based on the presented data, mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B is considered 
comparable to historical batch data.

815 LNP-B) 
There are no changes to the currently registered manufacturing and testing sites.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B is produced in a 200 g nominal batch size, according to the same manufacturing 
process described for mRNA-1273 LNP-B. There are no change to the registered information for control of 
critical steps and intermediates 
Process validation and/or evaluation  
For mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B, the only process change is the change in mRNA sequence. For mRNA-
1273.815 LNP-B, manufacturing, including controls remains the same as for mRNA-1273 LNP-B. 
Therefore, one PPQ batch manufactured per site (Moderna, Lonza Visp, Rovi Granada) has been 
considered sufficient.  Moderna has successfully completed PPQ verification of the mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B 
manufacturing process as a means of demonstrating that the commercial-scale manufacturing process is

capable of consistently delivering quality product. The PPQ verification has generated data at commercial 
scale to support and complement laboratory-scale studies. 
The results of the CPP, PP, critical and non-critical IPC and Drug Substance testing of the mRNA-1273.815 
LNP - B PPQ batches were within the specifications and the prior defined acceptance criteria. Based on the 
outcome of the PPQ exercise, the mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B manufacturing process has been successfully 
validated at the 200 g scale at ModernaTX Norwood, Lonza Visp and Rovi Granada. 
The MAH’s conclusion that the mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B process at 200 g manufacturing scale was 
successfully performed and process consistency demonstrated is supported. 
Control of finished product  
mRNA loaded LNP intermediate containing mRNA CX-038839 (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273. 
815 LNP-B) 
There is no change in specifications.  
The following attributes have been included in the specification for mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B: appearance, 
mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger sequencing, total RNA content by anion exchange 
chromatography, purity and product-related impurities by RP-IP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by 
absorbance assay, mean particle size and polydispersity by DLS, lipid identity and content by UPLC-CAD 
(SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, 
PEG2000- DMG), lipid impurities by UPLC-CAD (% individual impurities and sum of impurities), in vitro 
translation by methionine labelling, pH, osmolality, bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, kinetic 
chromogenic method) and bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12). This specification differs from the specification for 
mRNA-1273 LNP-B only with respect to the identity test.  
Method description and validation data for the identity test with Reverse transcription/Sanger sequencing 
is included. This test method can unambiguously distinguish prototype and variant mRNAs used in the 
manufacture of monovalent and bivalent mRNA-1273 drug products. All other analytical methods remain 
unchanged. The presented information for control of mRNA-1273.815 LNP–B is considered sufficient. 
The applicant’s conclusion that product- and process impurities of mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B are the same 
as for the other variants, is endorsed. The study results indicate that product-related impurities like RNA 
fragments and RNA-lipid adducts occur similarly in all variants (mRNA-1273 DP, mRNA-1273.045 DP and 
mRNA-1273.815 DP). In addition, the applicant has shown that the most abundant lipid-adducted 
nucleoside species occur in all variants. 
Comparison of the current and the former purity method confirms the previous observation that the new 
method leads to higher purity values - most probably due to poly A variants that are now included in the 
main peak. This is acceptable since the purity specification has been increased accordingly. The suitability 
of the new assay as stability-indicating method is confirmed by showing that for heat-degraded samples, 
the RNA degradation rates obtained from the two methods are highly comparable. 
Analytical procedure  
The analytical methods used for release testing of mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B and the prototype mRNA-1273 
LNPs are identical with the exception of the identity method, since this is the only method that is 
sequence-specific.  
This method has been validated and shown to be suitable for the purpose of determining the identity of 
mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B.

Batch analyses  
Batch analysis data is provided for mRNA-1273.815 LNP–B for the PPQ batches manufactured at Moderna 
TX Norwood, Rovi Granada and Lonza Visp. All results are within the specifications.  
Stability  
A shelf life of 12 months is proposed for mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B material stored in the commercial 
container closure system when stored at the recommended long-term storage condition of -60°C to -
90°C. 
The properties of mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles with respect to the attributes that affect product 
potency include the quantity of mRNA delivered; the fidelity of the mRNA sequence, including cap, tail, 
and open reading frame; the integrity of the mRNA; and various biophysical attributes of the lipid 
nanoparticles, particularly including the state of mRNA encapsulation and the size distribution of the 
particles. Direct measurements of those attributes of greatest significance have been established and 
include those assays in the routine release panel for mRNA-1273 LNPs and mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B. 
The product quality attribute expected to change most during the manufacturing and distribution of the 
product is mRNA integrity as assessed by mRNA purity with RP-IP-HPLC. The principal routes of 
degradation are hydrolytic chain scission, which is measured by the species which elute prior to the main 
peak (RNA fragments); and the formation of covalent adducts between the RNA and degradants of the 
cationic lipid, which are relatively hydrophobic and elute after the main peak (RNA-lipid adduct). There is 
a quantitative correlation between RNA degradation as measured directly and protein expression. The 
degradation rates can be determined from the purity analysis over different stability timepoints. Based on 
the stochastic nature of the degradation mechanism, there is a dependence of the rate of degradation on 
RNA size (length). Since CX-024414 and CX-038839 mRNA have approximately the same overall length 
(~4,000 nt), a similar rate of degradation is expected for mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B. 
No stability data for mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B stored at -70°C±10°C are currently available. The first 
testing point is 3 months. Data for one month at the storage conditions 5°C for all four batches and at 
25°C ± 5°C for one batch included in the stability programme have been provided. As expected OOS 
results for purity have been observed at 25°C ± 5°C. For batch 5018623001 manufactured at ModernaTX 
Norwood, OOS results occurred for main peak and RNA lipid adduct; the results were in trend and 
expected based on OOT limits after 2 weeks at 5°C storage. 
A minimum of one mRNA-1273.815 LNP-B Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) batch per year will be placed on 
stability. The stability protocol is provided.  
In summary, the proposed initial shelf-life of 12 months is acceptable taking into account the supportive 
data from other mRNA-1273 LNP-B Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) variants.

Description and composition of the finished product  
The description of the finished product mRNA-1273.815 multidose vial (MDV) is shown in Table 1. The 
mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) is an mRNA-lipid complex [lipid nanoparticle (LNP)] dispersion that 
contains the mRNA (CX-038839) that encodes for the pre-fusion stabilized Spike glycoprotein of XBB 1.5 
(Omicron) sub-variant of the 2019-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and four lipids which act as 
protectants and carriers of the mRNA. The four lipids are: SM-102 (a custom-manufactured, ionizable 
lipid), cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and 1, 2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-
methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000-DMG). There is no change in the finished product excipients 
compared to existing presentations. The mRNA-1273.815 Finished Product is supplied as a preservative-

The quantity of Total RNA (CX-038839) in the finished product mRNA 1273.815 MDV is 0.32 mg/vial (3.2 
mL fill) and 0.050 mg/dose (0.5 mL dose). 
Pharmaceutical development  
Formulation development activities for mRNA-1273 Drug Product leveraged historical knowledge from 
similar products to develop a suitable formulation for intramuscular injection. The mRNA-1273.815 DP 
shares the same compositional platform as the prior mRNA-1273 Drug Products. Therefore, all aspects of 
mRNA-1273 DP development can be extrapolated to mRNA- 1273.815 DP. 
Developmental stability studies have been conducted with mRNA-1273 DP prototype as well as multiple 
monovalent and multivalent variant vaccine DPs. The mRNA-1273 DP sequences are highly similar. The 
CX-038839 mRNA sequence differs relative to the CX-024414 mRNA prototype sequence, only in the

parts required to incorporate the specific mutations of the variant S protein. A statistical assessment has 
been performed on the data from various mRNA-1273 and associated variant DP development studies 
and GMP stability studies. The conclusions from are applicable to the mRNA-1273.815 DP. 
Data regarding Rovi SSRR, Dara 1 and Marchesini filling lines has been provided. Data for Catalent (US) 
will be submitted post-approval. 
Comparability of mRNA-1273.815 versus mRNA-1273 LNPs. 
The following two elements were included in the comparability study: 
1. Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process 
controls (IPCs). 
2. Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
Extended analytical characterization and forced degradation testing was not performed for mRNA-
1273.815 DP as part of comparability studies since the mRNA-1273 DPs characteristics are the same as 
the mRNA-1273 LNPs, and the extended characterization results for mRNA-1273 LNPs are thus 
considered representative of mRNA-1273 DPs. Extended characterization testing results for mRNA-1273 
LNPs conform to the comparability expected ranges as applicable and are presented in the dossier. 
The comparability approach was considered acceptable, however only results for a dummy labelled drug 
product LDP manufactured according to process alternative 1 (continued processing) were included. 
Dummy LDP refers to a small amount of UDP which is labelled with a pseudo artwork to simulate the 
labelling process where the final labels are not yet available.   
Manufacture  
Sites responsible for manufacturing and testing of the finished product (from mRNA-loaded LNP 
intermediate to finished product) have been described and valid EU GMP certificates have been provided. 
Manufacturers responsible for batch release are:  
-Rovi Pharma Industrial Services, S.A., Paseo de Europa 50, 28703 San Sebastián de los Reyes 
Madrid, Spain 
-Moderna Biotech Spain S.L., Calle del Príncipe de Vergara 132 Plt 12, Madrid 28002, Spain 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls of mRNA-1273.815 
Representative batch size, composition, and compounding formula for the manufacture of mRNA-
1273.815 DP – 0.10 mg/mL MDV are provided. The mRNA-1273.815 specific CPPs and associated PARs, 
and CIPCs and their associated acceptance criteria are provided in the submission. There are no changes 
to the approved manufacturing processes at the Rovi SSRR and Catalent sites. The control strategy is 
also the same with the exception of the mRNA-1273.214 specific CIPC “Weight ratio of LNPs” that does 
not apply for a monovalent DP. Two alternative manufacturing process flows have been designed for the 
0.10 mg/mL drug product and each unit operation along with tables of the associated process parameters 
are described. In summary, alternative process 1 represents the process with continuous forward 
processing to finished product. In alternative process 2, filled drug product vials are stored at (-50°C to -
15°C) until required for label and pack operations for up to 6 months. The vials are then thawed and 
labelled. In both process alternatives, a conditioning freeze step then occurs before the vials are 
transferred to the long term storage condition of -50°C to -15°C. The DP processing duration parameters 
at 2-8 °C are defined as the completion of LNP thaw (start of DP manufacture) to the beginning of the 
conditioning freeze step. This duration is monitored as the cumulative process duration (CPD) and 
process parameters to control time out of refrigeration are also set. These two durations are cumulative

over the course of the process. 
The mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) – 0.10 mg/mL is produced at the Rovi SSRR and Catalent 
manufacturing sites at a defined scale, according to the same manufacturing process as described for 
mRNA-1273 DP - 0.10 mg/mL. 
Process validation 
Since the sites are already registered for mRNA-1273.222, it is acceptable that only one verification batch 
has been manufactured per site and batch data has been submitted for Rovi, SSRR, Marchesini line, and 
the Catalent (US) site. Results of CIPCs, CPPs, IPCs, PP and release testing confirm consistent production 
of the variant vaccine at Rovi, SSRR, Dara 1 and Marchesini lines and Catalent (US).   
However, the situation for unlabelled drug product (UDP)/ labelled drug product (LDP) was confusingly 
described in the dossier and this was corrected upon request. Furthermore, a worst-case scenario LDP 
was manufactured with processing times higher than the given times for the batch LDP. The applicant 
satisfactorily explained the worst-case samples and updated section 3.2.P.3.5 with the corrected 
information referring to the batch. 
For Rovi SSRR and Patheon Monza sites (site withdrawn), one palette of dummy LDP (small amount of 
UDP labelled with a pseudo artwork to simulate the labelling process) was manufactured from unfrozen 
UDP to obtain results for cumulative (manufacturing) process duration (CPD) and LDP purity. Therefore, 
process alternative 2 is not represented by these results, because the freeze/thaw step is not included. As 
a consequence, only process alternative 1 is considered validated.  
The applicant was asked to confirm that only vaccine manufactured according to process 1 is released to 
the EU market or verification and release results and stability programs for process alternative 2 should 
be submitted. The applicant subsequently responded that for the Rovi, SSRR site, the UDP was indeed 
frozen before the labelling was conducted therefore representing process alternative 2. Process 2 
represents worst case therefore both processes 1 and 2 can be considered validated.  
It is also confirmed in the validation report for Patheon Monza, that only option 1 is covered by the 
interim verification report. The registration of the Patheon Monza site has been withdrawn from the 
submission as investigations around the % encapsulation results for the mRNA-1273.815 DP verification 
batch are on-going and the dossier will be updated accordingly within the closing sequence.  
For the Catalent site, only batches produced with process 1 will be released to the European market until 
process validation data for process 2 has been submitted and assessed (recommendation 2).  
For all sites, PPQ and comparability data has been submitted with the initial submission or during the 
procedure.  
Control of finished product  
The release specifications for mRNA-1273.815 FP are provided. The proposed finished product release 
specification includes tests for appearance (visual), total RNA content by anion exchange 
chromatography, mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger, purity and product-related impurities by 
RP-IP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by absorbance assay, in vitro translation (methionine labelling), lipid 
identity and content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by UPLC-
CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000- DMG), lipid impurities by UPLC-CAD (% individual impurities 
and sum of impurities), mean particle size and polydispersity by DLS, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, 
container content (USP, Ph. Eur. 2.6.17), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, kinetic chromogenic 
method) and sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1) and container closure integrity. 
There is no change in the specification except for the introduction of identity specification (included in the 
Assessment report

Type II variation), as approved for prototype mRNA-1273 (0.10mg/mL), and the addition of LDP % 
encapsulation testing with an action limit for XBB.1.5 presentations (Type IB grouped application).  
Note that the application to introduce an action limit of ≥ 85% ‘% RNA Encapsulation’ on labelled drug 
product (LDP) as a requirement for release, when Process Alternative 2 is used is agreed. This had been 
requested as a commitment for all presentations and sites during finalisation of procedure II-100-G 
(finalised 31 August 2023). This action limit will be in place until more data are available and the need of 
setting a specification can be evaluated. 
Analytical methods 
There are no changes in analytical methods except for the update of identity test by SOP-1337 (new 
primers) which has been validated and (is being) transferred to QC sites. Method transfer protocols for 
Monza and Eurofins have been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been collected on mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product PPQ verification batches from 
Rovi, Dara 1 and Marchesini line, Catalent and Patheon Monza (this site was subsequently withdrawn). 
Batch release results are available for the dummy LDPs (small amount of UDP labelled with a pseudo 
artwork to simulate the labelling process) manufactured according to process alternative 1. The 
Certificates of Analyses are provided. The batch data also includes the %encapsulation data from LDP. For 
Catalent, as mentioned before, the verification batch was produced following process 1 (no process 2 data 
available) and therefore batches from process 2 should not be brought on the European market before 
the respective data are submitted. 
The impurity profile of mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product is the same as that of the mRNA-1273 LNP. No 
additional impurities are anticipated to form or be introduced during mRNA- 1273.815 DP manufacturing. 
The impurities present in the mRNA-1273.815 DP are consistent with the mRNA-1273 prototype. 
Reference standards 
There is no change to the currently registered information for other presentations. 
Container closure system 
There is no change to the currently registered information for other presentations. To note, the vials are 
composed of either glass or cyclic olefin polymer. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf life is 9 months at the intended storage condition of -50°C to -15°C which includes up 
to 30 days at 2°C to 8°C, or 12 months at -50°C to -15°C which includes up to 14 days at 2°C to 8°C, 
and 24 hours at 8°C to 25°C as for the previous Spikevax variants. 
mRNA-1273 associated variant vaccine sequences include only the changes relative to the CX-024414 
mRNA sequence required to incorporate the specific mutations of the variant S protein sequence. The 
RNA length is highly conserved between the mRNA-1273 vaccine and mRNA 1273 associated variant 
vaccines. These minor differences in sequence and sequence length have negligible impact on the 
stability profile of the product.  
The extensive data available in the stability program and shelf-life assessment for the prototype mRNA-
1273 vaccine is directly applicable to mRNA-1273 associated variant vaccines. Supportive studies are 
provided in section 3.2.P.2.3. 
The dummy LDP batches placed on stability have been manufactured according to manufacturing process 
2. Only release data are currently available. Stability data will be provided post-approval. When Process

Alternative 2 is used, Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and annual stability samples 
representative of the LDP will be selected. 
A minimum of one mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) – 0.10 mg/mL Multiple-dose vial batch per year 
will be placed on stability. Stability testing will be conducted to the specifications provided. Samples 
representative of the LDP will be placed on stability at -25
 to -15
. During assessment, it was raised 
that the post-approval annual stability program should cover the worst-case storage conditions:

℃
maximum interim storage time of 6 months (if process alternative 2 is used) plus 9 months -20°C 
including 30 days 2-8°C followed by 24 h 25°C. The applicant should commit to update the annual 
stability program to reflect the long-term storage conditions of 9 months at -20°C including 30 days at 2-
8°C followed by 24h at 25°C, in an end-to-end stability annual program, for all sites. The applicant does 
not wish to include the maximum interim storage of 6 month at UDP level. The applicant should, with the 
future response to the commitment, provide a detailed justification why the inclusion of the full interim 
storage is not considered needed, to supplement the high-level information already provided 
(recommendation 3). 
The proposed shelf-life is acceptable, since it has been shown that RNA degradation rate is comparable to 
previous variants.

Comparability of mRNA-1273.815 versus mRNA-1273 LNPs.: 
The following two elements were included in the comparability study of SDV produced at the Patheon, 
Ferentino site: 
1. Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process 
controls (IPCs). 
2. Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
Extended analytical characterization and forced degradation testing was not performed for mRNA-
1273.815 DP as part of comparability studies since the mRNA-1273 DPs characteristics are the same as 
the mRNA-1273 LNPs, and the extended characterization results for mRNA-1273 LNPs are thus 
considered representative of mRNA-1273 DPs. Extended characterization testing results for mRNA-1273 
LNPs conform to the comparability expected ranges as applicable. CIPC and IPC results were reviewed for 
consistency as part of the comparability demonstration and all results were within control limits. All 
release results of the mRNA-1273.815 DP verification lot conformed to both the specification and 
comparability acceptance criteria. The comparability approach of mRNA-1273.815 SDV produced at the 
Patheon, Ferentino site versus mRNA-1273 LNPs is in principle acceptable, however only results for LDP 
manufactured according to process alternative 1 (continued processing) are included (see questions 
raised regarding process verification). Therefore, only process alternative 1 is considered validated 
currently.  
Manufacture  
Sites responsible for manufacturing and testing of the finished product (from mRNA-loaded LNP 
intermediate to finished product) have been described and valid EU GMP certificates have been provided. 
Manufacturers responsible for batch release are:  
-Patheon Italia S.p.A., 2 Trav. SX Via Morolense 5, 03013 Ferentino (FR), Italy-Moderna Biotech Spain 
S.L., Calle del Príncipe de Vergara 132 Plt 12, Madrid 28002, Spain 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls of mRNA-1273.815 
Representative batch size, composition, and compounding formula for the manufacture of mRNA-
1273.815 DP (50 mcg) at Patheon (Ferentino) are provided.  
The mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) in single-dose vial (SDV) is produced at defined scale according 
to the same manufacturing process described for mRNA-1273.214 DP in SDV (this is the Original/Omicron 
BA.1 DP). The manufacturing process and process controls described for mRNA-1273.214 SDV are 
applicable to either monovalent or multivalent mRNA-1273 DP in SDV, with the exception of the weight 
ratio of pooled LNP in-process control that does not apply for a monovalent DP. The mRNA-1273.815 
specific CPPs and associated PARs, and CIPCs and their associated acceptance criteria are provided in the 
submission. The control strategy is unchanged.  
Process valida�on 
Verification was performed at Patheon Ferentino.  
Since the sites are already registered for other Spikevax SDV presentations, it is acceptable that only one 
verification batch has been manufactured. Results of CIPCs, CPPs, IPCs, PP and release testing confirm 
consistent production of the variant vaccine, although the applicant was asked to clarify the 
manufacturing process time, indicating that this was indeed representative of the full process. The 
Assessment report

relevant documentation was updated. 
The Patheon Ferentino verification lot was manufactured from one palette of unfrozen UDP. Therefore, 
process alternative 2 is not represented by these results because the freeze/thaw step is not included. 
Therefore, only process alternative 1 is considered validated. The applicant was asked to confirm that 
only vaccine manufactured according to process 1 is released on the EU market or verification and release 
results and stability program for process alternative 2 should be submitted. The applicant responded that 
verification was performed with a batch from process 1 and justified this with the fact that process two is 
already qualified for mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.222. Therefore, the applicant stated that because 
alternative process 2 was successfully validated for mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273.222 at Patheon 
Ferentino, verification of alternative process 2 process was not repeated for introduction of the new 
mRNA-1273.815 sequence at this site. This statement is acknowledged however in light of differences in 
certain parameters between UDP and LDP following alternative process 2 it was clearly stated in pre-
submission meetings that verification should be performed with alternative process 2 lots. 
Verification results from additional sampling for PA2 will be submitted by 08 September 2023. The 
Sponsor will not commercialize any PA2 material from Patheon Ferentino to the European market until 
this commitment is complete (recommendation 4). This means that until the commitment is fulfilled only 
alternative process one is licensed for the Patheon Ferentino site. 
Control of finished product  
The release specifications for mRNA-1273.815 FP are provided. The proposed finished product release 
specification includes tests for appearance (visual), total RNA content by anion exchange 
chromatography, mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger, purity and product-related impurities by 
RP-IP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by absorbance assay, in vitro translation (methionine labelling), lipid 
identity and content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by UPLC-
CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000- DMG), lipid impurities by UPLC-CAD (% individual impurities 
and sum of impurities), mean particle size and polydispersity by DLS, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, 
container content (USP, Ph. Eur. 2.6.17), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, kinetic chromogenic 
method) and sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1) and container closure integrity. 
There is no change in specification except for the introduction of identity specification, as approved for 
prototype mRNA-1273 (0.10mg/mL) (included in the Type II variation) and the addition of LDP % 
encapsulation testing with an action limit (Type IB).  
Note that the application to introduce an action limit of ≥ 85% ‘% RNA Encapsulation’ on labelled drug 
product as a requirement for release, when Process Alternative 2 is used is agreed. This had been 
requested as a commitment for all presentations and sites during finalisation of procedure II-100-G 
(finalised 31 August 2023). This will be in place until more data are available and the need for setting a 
specification can be evaluated. 
Analytical methods 
There are no changes in analytical methods except for the update of identity test by SOP-1337 (new 
primers) which has been validated and is being transferred to QC sites. A method transfer report from 
Patheon Ferentino has been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been collected on one mRNA-1273.815 50 mcg single-dose vial Drug Product 
GMP batch from Patheon Ferentino. Batch release results are available for the dummy LDPs manufactured 
according to process alternative 1. The impurity profile of mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) is the same 
as that of the mRNA-1273 LNP.

Stability 
The proposed shelf life is 9 months at the intended storage condition of -50°C to -15°C which includes up 
to 30 days at 2°C to 8°C, or 12 months at -50°C to -15°C which includes up to 14 days at 2°C to 8°C, 
and 24 hours at 8°C to 25°C as for the previous Spikevax variant vaccines. 
The dummy LDP batch placed on stability has been manufactured according to process alternative 1. Only 
release data are currently available. The proposed shelf-life is acceptable, since it has been shown that 
RNA degradation rate of mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product is comparable to previous variants. Stability data 
will be provided post-approval. When Process Alternative 2 is used, Process Performance Qualification 
(PPQ) and annual stability samples representative of the LDP will be selected. 
A minimum of one (1) mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) SDV per year will be placed on stability. The 
mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product annual post approval stability protocol is provided. Samples representative 
of the LDP will be placed on stability at -25
 to -15
. The applicant commits to update the annual 
stability program by end of September to reflect the long-term storage conditions of 9 months at -20°C 
℃
including 30 days at 2-8°C followed by 24h at 25°C, in an end-to-end stability annual program for all 
℃

Comparability of mRNA-1273.815 versus mRNA-1273 LNPs: 
The following two elements were included in the comparability study: 
1. Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process 
controls (IPCs). 
2. Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
Extended analytical characterization and forced degradation testing was not performed for mRNA-
1273.815 DP as part of comparability studies since the mRNA-1273 DPs characteristics are the same as 
the mRNA-1273 LNPs, and the extended characterization results for mRNA-1273 LNPs are thus 
considered representative of mRNA-1273 DPs. Extended characterization testing results for mRNA-1273 
LNPs conform to the comparability expected ranges. 
mRNA-1273.815 DP – 50 mcg - PFS at Rovi San Sebastian los Reyes (SSRR): 
CIPC and IPC results were reviewed for consistency as part of the comparability demonstration and all 
results were within control limits. 
All release results of mRNA-1273.815 DP PFS verification lot conformed to both the specification and 
comparability acceptance criteria.  
mRNA-1273.815 DP – 50 mcg - PFS at Rovi JC: 
CIPC and IPC results were reviewed for consistency as part of the comparability demonstration and all 
results were within control limits. 
All release results of mRNA-1273.815 DP PFS verification lot conformed to both the specification and 
comparability acceptance criteria.  
Manufacture  
Sites responsible for manufacturing and testing of the finished product (from mRNA-loaded LNP 
intermediate to finished product) have been described and valid EU GMP certificates have been provided. 
Manufacturers responsible for batch release are:  
-Rovi Pharma Industrial Services, S.A., Julián Camarillo (Rovi JC), Calle Julián Camarillo 35, 28037 
Madrid, Spain 
-Rovi Pharma Industrial Services, S.A., San Sebastián de los Reyes (Rovi SSRR), Paseo de Europa 50,

Description of manufacturing process and process controls of mRNA-1273.815 
Representative batch size and manufacturing formula for the manufacture of mRNA-1273.815 DP PFS at 
Rovi JC and Rovi SSRR are provided in the submission. The DP process produces up to 250,000 syringes.  
Two alternative manufacturing process flows have been designed for the 0.10 mg/mL drug product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 22/48 
 
 
 
 
 
Process Alternative 1 consists of the process with continuous forward processing. Process Alternative 2 
consists of the process where a bulk syringe interim frozen state storage step after visual inspection, has 
been added. There is no change in the control strategy except for the identity and weight ratio of pooled 
LNP critical IPC that does not apply for a monovalent vaccine. The mRNA-1273.815 specific CPPs and 
associated PARs, and CIPCs and their associated acceptance criteria are provided in the submission. Since 
the sites are already registered for other Spikevax PFS presentations, it is acceptable that only one 
verification batch has been manufactured.  
The mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) in the prefilled syringe (PFS) presentation – 0.10 mg/mL is 
produced at the Rovi SSRR and Rovi JC manufacturing sites at a defined scale, according to the same 
manufacturing process as described for mRNA-1273 DP - 0.10 mg/mL in PFS. 
Process validation 
Rovi SSRR: 
PPQ verification was performed on the Dara 3 fill line at Rovi, which is representative of all the 
manufacturing lines already used at the same manufacturing site (Dara 1 and Marchesini lines).  
All CQAs, CPPs, and CIPCs met the acceptance criteria defined in the PPQ verification protocol and the DP 
Commercial Control Strategy. All IPCs were confirmed to be within target ranges.  A dummy LDP batch 
has been manufactured to obtain results for final CPD and %RNA purity. The applicant clarified that the 
batch produced at Rovi SSRR was manufactured according to process 2 and updated the respective 
documents. 
Rovi JC: 
A process performance qualification (PPQ) verification of the PFS was performed at Rovi JC on the Optima 
filling line. 
All CQAs, CPPs, and CIPCs met the acceptance criteria defined in the PPQ verification protocol and the DP 
Commercial Control Strategy. All IPCs were confirmed to be within target ranges.  The applicant clarified 
that no dummy LDP was manufactured. Instead, the LDP activities were performed on the entire batch 
according to process alternative 2. So, both process 1 and process 2 are covered. An updated PPQ report 
will be provided post-approval (recommendation 5). 
Control of finished product  
An updated specification for mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) has been provided. The following 
attributes have been included in the specification for mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP): appearance, 
total RNA content by anion exchange chromatography, mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger 
sequencing, purity and product-related impurities by RP-IP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by absorbance 
assay, in vitro translation by methionine labelling, lipid identity and content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, 
cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000- 
DMG), lipid impurities by UPLC-CAD (% individual impurities and sum of impurities), mean particle size 
and polydispersity by DLS, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, deliverable volume, bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur. 2.6.14), sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1), break loose and gliding force. This specification differs from 
the specification for mRNA-1273 LNP-B only with respect to the identity test.  
Note that the application to introduce an action limit of ≥ 85% ‘% RNA Encapsulation’ on labelled drug 
product (LDP) as a requirement for release, when Process Alternative 2 is used is agreed. This had been 
requested as a commitment for all presentations and sites during finalisation of procedure II-100-G 
(finalised 31 August 2023). This will be in place until more data are available and the need of setting a 
specification can be evaluated.

Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data have been generated for one mRNA-1273.815 DP - 50 mcg - PFS batch according to 
the approved specifications at both manufacturing sites (Rovi JC and Rovi SSRR).  As clarified by the 
company, batch release results are available for the LDPs manufactured according to process alternative 
2. 
The impurity profile of mRNA-1273.815 Drug Product (DP) is the same as that of the mRNA-1273 LNP.

Stability 
The proposed shelf life is 9 months at the intended storage condition of -50°C to -15°C which includes up 
to 30 days at 2°C to 8°C, or 12 months at -50°C to -15°C which includes up to 14 days at 2°C to 8°C, 
and 24 hours at 8°C to 25°C, as for the previous Spikevax variant vaccines. 
 The applicant clarified upon request that the provided information was wrong for the stability program 
for the PPQ lots. The corrected data was provided clarifying that lot from process 2 were used in stability 
studies and the manufacturing date was for LDP not UDP batches. Stability data will be provided post-
approval. When Process Alternative 2 is used, Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and annual 
stability samples representative of the LDP will be selected. 
Samples representative of the LDP will be placed in stability in accordance with the annual post approval 
stability protocol for the mRNA-1273 - 0.10 mg/mL PFS. The post-approval annual stability program 
should cover the worst-case storage conditions: maximum interim storage time of 6 months (if process 
alternative 2 is used) plus 9 months -20°C including 30 days 2-8°C followed by 24 h 25°C. The applicant 
commits to update the annual stability program by end of September to reflect the long-term storage 
conditions of 9 months at -20°C including 30 days at 2-8°C followed by 24h at 25°C, in an end-to-end 
stability annual program (recommendation 3) 
The proposed shelf-life is acceptable, since it has been shown that RNA degradation rate of mRNA-
1273.815 Drug Product is comparable to previous variants.  
3.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During this application pertaining to:  
• 
• 
the addition of a new strain (Omicron XBB.1.5, andusomeran) resulting in six new monovalent 
presentations and  
to use Analytical testing site, Microsynth AG, Balgach Switzerland, as an alternative site 
responsible for Reverse Transcription Sanger Sequencing (RTSS) batch quality control testing for 
identity of the finished product,  
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 24/48 
 
 
 
 
• 
to add an action limit of ≥ 85% to the specification ‘% RNA Encapsulation’ on labelled drug 
product (LDP) as a requirement for release, when Process Alternative 2 is used  
no major objections were raised.  
Questions were raised during the procedure regarding editorial/ documentation errors and they have 
been or will be corrected in the closing sequence unless otherwise specified.  
The key OC raised on the active substance side was the need to implement an annual stability study that 
reflects the actual shelf life claim (3 month at -15 to -25°C before transfer to -60 to -90°C) 
(recommendation 1).  
On the FP side, Moderna has established two process alternatives for FP manufacturing: unlabelled drug 
product (UPD) is directly labelled to become labelled drug product (LDP) or UPD is frozen and can be 
stored at -20°C for up to 6 months before it is thawed and labelled to become LDP. So far only purity and 
% encapsulation is tested at LDP with recommendations on-going in different procedures (II-100-G) to 
re-assess the need to test other parameters at LDP. Confirmation has been sought that LDP from process 
2 (considered worst-case) not UDP is used for stability programs. For the purposes of this application, the 
clarification provided regarding the absence of verification of worst-case process 2 in process validation 
studies has resulted in several recommendations: 
1.  Moderna is asked to commit that from the Catalent site and for the Patheon Ferentino site, 
only FP batches produced with process 1 will be submitted to the European market until 
process validation data for process 2 has been submitted and assessed (recommendations 2 
and 4). 
2.  Verification results from additional sampling for alternative process 2 at Patheon Ferentino  
submitted on 08 September 2023 were not deemed sufficient to support the use of process 
alternative 2 at this site. 
The applicant has also committed to provide an updated PPQ report for Rovi JC by end of September 
2023 (recommendation 5). For all other sites, PPQ reports have been provided with the initial submission 
or during the procedure.  
Upon request, the applicant has committed to update the annual stability program for DP by end of 
September to reflect the long-term storage conditions of 9 months at -20°C including 30 days at 2-8°C 
followed by 24h at 25°C, in an end-to-end stability annual program for all manufacturing sites 
(recommendation 3) 
Finally, during the procedure the Patheon Monza FP site was withdrawn. No further data were provided 
for mRNA-1273.815 batches manufactured at this site as part of this procedure, as investigations around 
the % encapsulation results for the mRNA-1273.815 DP verification batch are on-going.  
After considering the answers to the questions raised, the quality data is deemed sufficient subject to the 
below recommendations. 
3.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The submitted quality data are acceptable subject to the below recommendations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 25/48 
 
 
 
 
3.7.  Recommendations for future quality development 
1.  The applicant commits to submit a revised Section 3.2.S.7.2 {CX-038839} by the end of 
September 2023 to reflect the AS shelf-life claim, including the optional interim storage at -25°C 
to -15°C in the annual stability protocol. 
2.  Moderna is asked to commit that from the Catalent site only, FP batches produced with process 1 
will be submitted to the European market until process validation data for process 2 has been 
submitted and assessed. 
3.  The applicant commits to update the annual stability program for DP by end of September to 
reflect the long-term storage conditions of 9 months at -20°C including 30 days at 2-8°C followed 
by 24h at 25°C, in an end-to-end stability annual program for all manufacturing sites. The 
applicant is asked to commit that with this submission a detailed justification will be provided why 
the inclusion of the full interim storage is not considered needed to supplement the high-level 
response already provided. 
4.  The applicant should commit to not commercialise any PA2 material from Patheon Ferentino to 
the European market until acceptable process verification data has been submitted and assessed 
5.  The applicant commits to provide an updated PPQ report for Rovi JC by end of September 2023. 
4.  Non-clinical aspects 
4.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted non-clinical data in support of the authorisation of the monovalent SARS-CoV-2 
vaccine mRNA-1273.815, based on previous authorised monovalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine mRNA-1273. 
mRNA-1273.815 includes a single mRNA, which encodes for the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. 
For this variation, the MAH presented non-clinical data from 3 studies. The non-clinical data comprises of 
non-GLP immunogenicity studies conducted in young mice. 
The new variant vaccines are produced with the same LNP composition than the parental mRNA-1273 
vaccine. All mRNAs are formulated into a mixture of the four LNP lipids SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC (1,2-
distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and PEG2000-DMG. A sufficient pharmacokinetics and toxicity 
data package was already provided for the MAA of mRNA-1273.Due to the same vaccine platform, no new 
pharmacokinetic or toxicity data were provided for the variant vaccines. 
4.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Study MOD-6037: Evaluation of Immunogenicity of a Primary Series of Monovalent and Bivalent SARS-
CoV-2 XBB.1.5-containing Vaccines in Mice  
In this study, the immunogenicity of a primary series of the SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5-containing vaccines 
was evaluated in mice. The test articles were:  
• 
• 
The monovalent mRNA-1273.815; it contains a single mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P 
antigen of the XBB.1.5/XBB.1.9.1 Omicron subvariant (note: the spike protein of XBB.1.9.1 is 
identical to that of XBB.1.5) 
The bivalent mRNA-1273.231 vaccine. It is a 1:1 bench side mix of mRNA-1273.045, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 26/48 
 
 
 
 
 
contains a single mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P antigen of the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants of 
• 
• 
Omicron, and mRNA-1273.815.  
The monovalent mRNA-1273.045 
The bivalent mRNA-1273.222 vaccine, which is a co-formulation of mRNA-1273 (single mRNA 
encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 S-2P antigen) and mRNA-1273.045 vaccines. 
The monovalent mRNA-1273.045 and the bivalent mRNA-1273.222 vaccines served as controls. PBS was 
used as negative control. 
Preclinical mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.045, mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.222 were prepared with the 
same method as the Good Manufacturing Practice clinical drug products.  
Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (n=8/group) received two intramuscular injections of PBS control 
article or 1 μg mRNA vaccines as a primary series 3 weeks apart (Day 1 and Day 22). Blood was collected 
from all animals on Day 21 (three weeks after Dose 1) and Day 36 (two weeks after Dose 2). Serum 
samples were analysed for Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein-specific (S-2P) binding IgG antibody responses via 
ELISA and subvariant-specific neutralising antibody responses via VSV-based PSVNA.  
Table 4: Study design for Study MOD-6037
All tested mRNA-1273 vaccine variants showed three weeks after the first vaccine dose a similar high 
spike protein-specific binding IgG antibody response in serum. Two weeks after the second dose, the 
binding antibody increased further in all mRNA-1273 variant vaccinated mice. The XBB.1.5-specific 
vaccines obtained high S-2P binding antibody titres comparable to the binding antibody titres observed in 
mice administered monovalent mRNA-1273.045 and bivalent mRNA-1273.222. 
Figure 1: Binding Antibody Responses in BALB/c mice after primary serios vaccination 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 27/48 
 
 
 
 
 
On Day 36, mice that received monovalent mRNA-1273.815 or bivalent mRNA-1273.231 had the highest 
neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16. Mice that received mRNA-1273.045 or mRNA-
1273.222 had lower serum neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16. Neutralising 
antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and against XBB.1.16 were comparable by treatment groups. Thus, the 
MAH suggested that these strains are antigenically similar. Among mice that received monovalent mRNA-
1273.815 or bivalent mRNA-1273.231, neutralising antibody titres against D614G were very low. mRNA-
1273.231 had higher titres against the BA.4/BA.5 strains compared to the mRNA-1273.815 vaccine, 
consistent with the inclusion of BA.4/BA.5 in the bivalent vaccine. In the mRNA-1273.045 group, the 
highest neutralising antibody titres were against BA.4/BA.5, followed by XBB.1.16, XBB.1.5, and D614G. 
In the mRNA-1273.222 group, the highest neutralising antibody titres were against BA.4/BA.5, followed 
by D614G, XBB.1.16 and XBB.1.5.

Evaluation of Immunogenicity of Monovalent and Bivalent SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5-containing Vaccine 
Boosters in Mice (MOD-5827) 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of a booster dose of monovalent (mRNA-
1273.815) and bivalent (mRNA-1273.231) SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5-containing vaccines in mice that have 
received primary series vaccination with mRNA-1273. The monovalent mRNA-1273.045 vaccine and the 
bivalent mRNA-1273.222 were used as controls. PBS was used as a negative control. 
The parental monovalent mRNA-1273 vaccine was administered as a primary series (Dose 1 and Dose 2). 
mRNA-1273.815, mRNA-1273.231, mRNA-1273.045, and mRNA-1273.222 were administered as a 
booster dose (Dose 3). The bivalent mRNA-1273.231 vaccine is a 1:1 bench side mix of mRNA-1273.045 
and mRNA-1273.815. Preclinical mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.045, mRNA-1273.815, and mRNA-1273.222 
were prepared with the same method as the Good Manufacturing Practice clinical drug products.  
Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (n=8/group) were administered 0.5 μg mRNA-1273 on Day 1 and 
Day 22. Approximately ten weeks after the second dose (Day 92), these mice were boosted with 1 μg 
mRNA-1273.045, mRNA-1273.815, mRNA-1273.222, or mRNA-1273.231.  
Blood samples were collected on Day 21 (three weeks after Dose 1), on Day 36 (two weeks after Dose 2), 
on Day 91 (one day before the booster dose), and at Day 106 (two weeks after the booster dose). 
Samples were analysed for serum Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein-specific binding IgG antibodies using ELISA 
and neutralising antibodies using VSV-based PSVNA.

Three weeks after mRNA-1273 Dose 1 (Day 21), the anti-Wuhan S-2P IgG binding antibody titres were 
low in all vaccinated mice. Two weeks after the second mRNA-1273 dose (Day 36), the binding antibody 
titres increased significantly in all vaccinated mice, increasing 34- to 46-fold from Day 21. By Day 106, 
robust binding antibody titres against Wuhan S-2P were observed in all vaccine groups, which only 
moderately increased compared to Day 36 antibody titre. mRNA-1273.045 induced slightly higher anti-
Wuhan S-2P binding antibody response compared to mRNA-1273.815, mRNA-1273.231 and mRNA-
1273.222, which elicited comparable anti-Wuhan S2P-binding antibody titres after boosting. 
Figure 3: Binding Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Boosting With Third Dose 
On Day 91 (pre-boost), robust neutralising antibody titres against D614G were observed in all vaccine 
groups. Neutralising antibody titres against BA.4/BA.5 at Day 91 were very low in all vaccinated mice. 
Negligible neutralising antibody titres were observed against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in all vaccinated 
mice.  
Two weeks after boosting (Day 106), mice that received monovalent mRNA-1273.815 or bivalent mRNA-

1273.231 showed slightly higher serum neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 
compared to mice that received mRNA-1273.045 or mRNA-1273.222. Overall, all vaccinated mice showed 
a significant increase of neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 after the booster dose, 
but only up to a moderate level. 
In addition, all vaccinated mice showed a significant increase of neutralising antibody titres against 
BA.4/BA.5 after the booster dose. However, the mRNA-1273.815 group showed the lowest neutralising 
antibody titre at a moderate level, compared to mRNA-1273.045, mRNA-1273.231 or mRNA-1273.222 
vaccinated mice, which induced a ~ 5- to 10-fold higher neutralisation titres. 
Furthermore, mice that received monovalent mRNA-1273.815 or bivalent mRNA-1273.231 showed a 
small increase of anti-D614G neutralising antibody titres. In comparison, mRNA-1273.045 and mRNA-
1273.222 vaccinated mice developed slightly higher anti-D614G neutralising antibody responses.

Study MOD-5972: Evaluation of Immunogenicity of Monovalent and Bivalent SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.16-
containing Vaccine Boosters in Mice 
In this study, the immunogenicity was evaluated of a booster dose of monovalent and bivalent SARS-
CoV-2 XBB.1.16-containing vaccines in mice that have received primary series vaccination with parental 
mRNA-1273. The study was conducted with the monovalent mRNA-1273.116 vaccine, which contains a 
single mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P antigen of the XBB.1.16 Omicron subvariant, and the 
bivalent mRNA-1273.234 vaccine, which is a 1:1 bench side mix of separately formulated mRNA-
1273.045 and mRNA-1273.116 vaccines.  
mRNA-1273 vaccine was administered as a primary series (Dose 1 and Dose 2). mRNA-1273.116 or 
mRNA-1273.234 were administered as a booster dose (Dose 3). PBS was used as a negative control.  
Preclinical mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.045 were prepared with the same method as the Good 
Manufacturing Practice mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.045 clinical drug products. Preclinical material for 
mRNA-1273.116 was prepared with the representative manufacturing process conditions for mRNA-
1273.116, with the exception of the IDR sequence present in the 3′UTR. However, the MAH included an 
IDR sequences of up to 25 nucleotides in the 3′UTR of the final clinical drug substance to facilitate

analytical detection. Because UTR regions are noncoding and therefore will not be translated into 
proteins, these modifications have no impact on the quality attributes, stability profile, functional activity, 
or safety of the mRNA product according to the sponsor.  
Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (n=8/group) were administered intramuscularly 0.5 μg mRNA-1273 
on Day 1 and Day 22 (primary series). On Day 71, mice were boosted with 1 μg of mRNA-1273.116 or 
mRNA-1273.234. Blood samples were collected on Day 21 (three weeks after Dose 1), on Day 36 (two 
weeks after Dose 2), on Day 70 (before the booster dose), and on Day 85 (two weeks after the booster 
dose). Samples were analysed for serum Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein-specific binding IgG antibodies via 
ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 variant specific neutralising antibodies using VSV-based PSVNA. 
Table 6: Study Design for Study MOD-5972 
Three weeks after the first mRNA-1273 dose, anti-S-2P IgG binding antibody titres were low in all 
vaccinated mice. Two weeks after the second mRNA-1273 dose, anti-S-2P IgG binding antibody titres 
increased significantly in vaccinated mice. By Day 70, anti-S-2P IgG binding antibody titres dropped 
slightly in the vaccinated mice. Two weeks after boosting with the variant vaccines, both vaccines elicited 
a comparable 4-fold increase in binding IgG antibody titres from Day 70 pre-boost.

On Day 70 (pre-boost), robust neutralising antibody titres against D614G were observed in all vaccinated 
mice. However, neutralising antibody titres against BA.4/BA.5 were lower compared with those against 
D614G. Negligible neutralising antibody responses were observed against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in many 
mice, indicating substantial immune escape from mRNA-1273 vaccination for these strains. 
Two weeks after boosting, mice that received mRNA-1273.116 or mRNA-1273.234 showed increased 
neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 up to a moderate level. The neutralising 
antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 were slightly higher in mRNA-1273.234 vaccinated mice. 
Neutralising antibody titres against BA.4/BA.5 were remarkably higher in the bivalent mRNA-1273.234 
mice compared to mRNA-1273.116 mice, consistent with the inclusion of BA.4/BA.5 in the vaccine. 
Bivalent mRNA-1273.234 also boosted titres against D614G to a greater extent compared to the 
monovalent mRNA-1273.116. 
Figure 6: Neutralising Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Boosting (Third Dose) 
4.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the approval of the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant vaccine, the MAH showed in two non-clinical 
pharmacodynamics studies that monovalent mRNA-1273.815 (and bivalent mRNA-1273.231) induced 
moderate neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 and spike protein-specific binding antibody titres 
after two dose primary vaccination series in naïve mice and after one booster dose in mRNA-1273-primed 
mice. XBB.1.5-specific neutralising antibody titres were not detected in mice vaccinated only with 
parental mRNA-1273, indicating substantial immune escape from mRNA-1273 vaccination for Omicron 
XBB subvariants. Furthermore, vaccination with monovalent mRNA-1273.815 (or bivalent mRNA-
1273.231) increased D614G-specific and BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising antibody titre in mice.  
A third non-clinical study submitted showed that the XBB.1.16-specific vaccines, monovalent mRNA-
1273.116 and bivalent mRNA-1273.234, elicited similar immunogenicity responses in mice. The measured 
neutralising antibody titres against XBB.1.5 were comparable to titres against XBB.1.16 in the conducted 
non-clinical immunogenicity studies. Thus, XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 seems to be antigenically similar. 
Additional toxicity or pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted and were not considered necessary due

to the high similarity to the parental mRNA-1273 vaccine, which is based on the same platform. This was 
acceptable. 
4.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that from a non-clinical perspective, mRNA-1273.815 is approvable. 
5.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Design and Objectives 
mRNA-1273-P205 is a phase 2/3 open-label study in adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
SARS-CoV-2 variant-containing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. P205 part J evaluates the safety, 
reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a 50 μg dose of the mRNA-1273.815 vaccine which contains 50 μg 
mRNA of the Omicron XBB.1.5 spike protein and of the mRNA-1273.231 vaccine which contains equal 
mRNA amounts of the Omicron XBB.1.5 and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike proteins (25 μg XBB.1.5 / 25 μg 
BA.4/BA.5). The vaccines were administered as a fifth dose to adults who previously received a two-dose 
primary series and a booster dose of an original COVID-19 vaccine and another booster dose of a bivalent 
(Original + Omicron BA.4/BA.5) vaccine.  
The two groups were randomised 1:1 in an open-label fashion. The P205 part J study endpoints and 
objectives as per P205 study protocol version 10, are included in the following table.

Participants who previously received a primary series of mRNA vaccine, a first booster dose of 
a monovalent mRNA vaccine, and a second booster dose of a bivalent mRNA vaccine against 
SARS-CoV-2 
Only immunogenicity results from Day 15 were provided. All analyses were descriptive; there was no 
hypothesis testing pre-specified with respect to the immune responses. Lastly, per the study protocol, 
surveillance for COVID-19 events as an exploratory objective begins 14 days after the booster dose, it is 
therefore not applicable to the Day 15 interim analysis.  
Study population, demographics, and baseline characteristics  
P205J participants were enrolled between 25 April 2023 and 27 April 2023. Their baseline characteristics 
(including age, gender, interval between prior doses and evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection) are 
shown in the below table.

Table 8: Select demographics and study participants characteristics (Safety Set) 
Overall, 101 adult participants were randomised between two arms; 50 participants received mRNA-
1273.815 and 51 participants received mRNA-1273.231. The mean age was 51.6 and 48.4 years in the 
mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Eleven of 50 (22%) mRNA-1273.815 and 7 of 
51 (13.7%) were above 65 years of age. The interval between the fourth dose (BA.4/BA.5 bivalent 
vaccine) and the investigational vaccine dose in P205J was a median of 8.2 months and 8.3 months for 
the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Intervals between prior doses (second 
and third, third and fourth) were also balanced between the two groups. Lastly, 34 of 50 (68%) and 40 of 
51 (78.4%) participants in the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively, had evidence 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibody test or positive baseline SARS-
CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test) prior to receiving the investigational vaccine. 
5.2.  Results 
Immunogenicity 
There was no pre-specified hypothesis on the immune responses elicited by the mRNA-1273.815 and 
mRNA-1273.231 vaccines and no statistical testing was performed for an immunogenicity comparison 
between the two randomised groups; all analyses were descriptive.  
The baseline, Day 15 neutralising antibody responses (Geometric Mean Titres, GMT) and the Geometric 
Mean Fold Rises (GMFRs) after the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 doses are shown below. 
In addition, seroresponse (at least 4-fold rise from baseline) rates (SRR) are provided for BA.4/BA.5 and 
D614G. SRR are calculated only when the pseudovirus assay has an established lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) in a validated assay (D614G, BA.4/BA.5). The XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1 are 
qualified assays. All assays were performed at the Duke University laboratories using consistent methods 
(Chalkias et al, NEJM, 2022).

Neutralising Ab values against SARS-CoV-2 variants are shown only for baseline titres and titres 15 days 
after vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5. Booster vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5 increases nAb titres 
against all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, BA.4/BA.5, BQ.1.1 and ancestral D614G). 
Baseline titres against different variants differ substantially. In the sub-group of previously not SARS-
CoV-2 infected participants, baseline titres against D614G (ancestral strain) and BA.4/BA.5 are 
substantially higher than nAb GMTs against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1. This is expected as the 
participants have received prior vaccination against D614G (ancestral strain) as a primary series and a 
first booster, followed by bivalent booster vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 original+BA.4/BA.5. 
Expectedly, in the sub-group of participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection bivalent Spikevax 
BA.4/BA.5+XBB.1.5 further increases nAB GMTs against BA.4/BA.5 as compared to booster vaccination 
with monovalent Spikevax XBB.1.5.  
Neutralising Ab GMTs against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1 after booster vaccination with Spikevax 
XBB.1.5 are overall expectedly higher in participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection but are comparable 
within each of the particular sub-groups (with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection). 
Interestingly, in the sub-group of participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection booster vaccination with 
bivalent Spikevax BA.4/BA.5+XBB.1.5 does not elicit higher nAB GMTs against SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 as

compared to booster vaccination with monovalent Spikevax XBB.1.5. There is no obvious reason for this 
finding which needs to remain an observation. 
Regarding seroconversion rates, for mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 the Day 15 D614G SRR (95% 
CI) was 32.7% (19.9%, 47.5%) and 22.4% (11.8%, 36.6%) respectively and the BA.4/BA.5 SRR was 
69.4% (54.6%, 81.7%) and 62.0% (47.2%, 75.3%), respectively. It should be noted that for BA.4/BA.5 
and D614G the pre-booster titres were numerically higher than the pre-booster titres of other variants 
(XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, BQ.1.1) given that all participants had been previously vaccinated with the original 
and the Original + BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccines. 
5.3.  Discussion 
The MAH presented immunogenicity results from study P205 part J on booster vaccination with 
monovalent Spikevax XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) and bivalent Spikevax BA.4/BA.5+XBB.1.5 (mRNA-
1273.231) day 15 after vaccination.  
Results were presented only descriptively, partially due to the limited sample size of about 50 participants 
per group. Participants in the two groups were overall sufficiently well balanced. Due to the small sample 
size analyses must be considered with caution, in particular, for sub-group analyses. 
It is understood that the participants were followed since the primary vaccination series. Before any of 
the tested vaccinations, a SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibody test or PCR test was performed. The 
resulting group of participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection therefore needs to be considered 
heterogeneous with regards to time since infection and infecting SARS-CoV-2 variant. 
Overall, booster vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5 increased nAb titres against all tested SARS-CoV-2 
variants (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, BA.4/BA.5, BQ.1.1 and ancestral D614G). Due to the relatively recent 
emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1, and given the experience with 
this assay against other SARS-CoV-2 variants, for which the assays were validated, use of qualified 
assays for this submission as opposed to fully validated assays was considered acceptable. 
Baseline titres against different variants differ substantially. In the subgroup of previously not SARS-CoV-
2 infected participants, baseline titres against D614G (ancestral strain) and BA.4/BA.5 were substantially 
higher than nAb GMTs against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1. This was expected as the participants have 
received prior vaccination against D614G (ancestral strain) as a primary series and a first booster, 
followed by bivalent booster vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 original+BA.4/BA.5. Expectedly, in the 
subgroup of participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, bivalent Spikevax BA.4/BA.5+XBB.1.5 
further increased nAB GMTs against BA.4/BA.5 as compared to booster vaccination with monovalent 
Spikevax XBB.1.5.  
Neutralising Ab GMTs against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and BQ.1.1 after booster vaccination with Spikevax 
XBB.1.5 were overall expectedly higher in participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection but were 
comparable within each of the particular subgroups (with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection). 
Interestingly, in the subgroup of participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection booster vaccination with 
bivalent Spikevax BA.4/BA.5+XBB.1.5 did not elicit higher nAB GMTs against SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 as 
compared to booster vaccination with monovalent Spikevax XBB.1.5. There is no obvious reason for this 
finding which remains as an observation. 
In summary, booster vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5 increased nAb GMTs against all tested SARS-
CoV-2 variants in both subgroups, with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results from both sub-
groups are important in the current epidemiological situation as an increase in nAb GMTs after booster 
vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5 in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides the impact 
of the vaccination as such, and an increase in nAb GMTs in participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

(or overall population with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection) can be considered a real-world 
scenario. 
According to the WHO, recently the EG.5 and BA.2.86 variants warrant close scrutiny. The MAH has 
informed on the availability of cross-neutralisation data against the EG.5 and BA.2.86 variants showing 
that the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine induces an immune response consistent with the previous Omicron 
sub-lineages. Therefore, cross-neutralisation data against these variants should be formally submitted in 
the variation dossier (REC). 
5.4.  Conclusion on the clinical efficacy aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the clinical immunogenicity data provided for Spikevax XBB.1.5 (mRNA-
1273.815) is deemed acceptable. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the clinical efficacy issues:

Clinical data have been provided from the clinical study P205 Part J to support this variation. 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an open label, phase 2/3 study in adults to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variant-containing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. P205 part J 
evaluates the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a 50 μg dose of the mRNA 1273.815 vaccine 
and of the mRNA-1273.231 vaccine. The vaccines were administered as a fifth dose to adults who 
previously received a two-dose primary series, a booster dose of an original COVID-19 vaccine and a 
booster dose of a bivalent (Original + Omicron BA.4/BA.5) vaccine. The two groups were randomised 1:1 
in an open-label fashion. 
The safety objectives included in the protocol of the Study P205 Part J refer to: Primary Objectives: To 
evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.815 (50 μg) and mRNA-1273.231 (50 μg); 
Exploratory Objectives: To assess for symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
The clinical data cut-off date is 16 May 2023. 
6.2.  Results 
Patient exposure 
In study P205 Part J were enrolled 101 participants between 25-27 April 2023. The participants were 
randomised between two arms. 50 participants received monovalent XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) vaccine 
and 51 participants received bivalent XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.231) vaccine. 
The median follow-up time for both vaccine groups was 20 days (range 20 to 22 days, data cut-off date 
16 May 2023).

Demography  
The demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in the Safety Set of study P205J are 
presented in  
Table 8. Participants median age was 54.5 and 48.0 years in the monovalent XBB.1.5 and in the bivalent 
XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine groups, respectively. Eleven of 50 (22.0%) participants in the MV XBB.1.5 and 7 
of 51 (13.7%) participants in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine groups were above 65 years of age. 
Approximately 68% (34/50) participants in the monovalent XBB.1.5 and 78.4% (40/51) participants in 
the bivalent XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine groups, had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of 
vaccination. 
The interval between the fourth dose (BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine) and the investigational vaccine dose in 
P205J was a median of 8.2 months and 8.3 months for the monovalent XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) and 
the bivalent XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.231) groups, respectively. Intervals between prior doses 
(second and third, third and fourth) were also balanced between the two groups. 
Adverse events 
Safety assessment in Study P205 included monitoring of: 
•  Solicited local and systemic ARs that occurred during the 7 days following each injection, recorded 
daily using an eDiary. 
•  Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following each injection. 
•  AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation from Day 1 through the last 
day of study participation. 
•  SAEs, Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs) and AESIs from the first dose on Day 1 
through the entire study period.

no MAAEs in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5. There were four non-SAE, non-AESI unsolicited AE reported; 3 
were considered non-related to the study investigational product (one event of supraventricular 
tachycardia; one event of upper respiratory tract infection and one event of hypoesthesia) and one event 
as vaccine related (Rhinovirus infection).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no unsolicited AEs leading to discontinuation from study vaccine or study participation during 
the study period.  
SAEs, AESIs and Deaths 
There were no fatal or serious adverse events and no adverse events of special interest reported until 
Day 29 (data cut-off date May 25, 2023). 
6.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Within this submission the MAH requested the approval for use of the new COVID-19 vaccine formulation 
mRNA-1273.815 (monovalent XBB.1.5). Clinical data have been provided from the clinical study P205 
Part J. The XBB.1.5-containing vaccines, MV XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) and BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (mRNA-
1273.231) were administered as a 3rd Booster dose (fifth dose).  
Overall it is observed lower frequency of solicited ARs (including local and systemic ARs) in the MV 
XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) compare to the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.231), respectively 76.0% 
and 88.2%.  
Up to the 16th May cut-off date, any solicited local ARs were reported by 68.0 % participants in the MV 
XBB.1.5 and from 84.3% participants in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine group. Pain was the most 
reported local ARs (respectively 68.0% and 82.4%).  Grade 3 events were reported by 0 and 3 (5.9%) 
participants respectively. No grade 4 events were reported.  
Any solicited systemic ARs were reported from 58.0% participants in the MV XBB.1.5 and 64.7% in the 
BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine group. The most reported systemic solicited ARs was fatigue (respectively 
44.0% and 49.0%). Grade 3 events were respectively reported by 1 (2.0%) and 4 (7.8%) participants. 
No grade 4 events were reported. 
Any fever >38 ⁰C was reported by 3 (6.0%) participants in the MV XBB.1.5 and by 1 (2.0%) participants 
in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 vaccine groups. Grade 3 event fever was reported in 1 participant (2.0%) in 
the MV XBB.1.5 vaccine group.   
Up to the 25th May data cut-off, unsolicited TEAEs regardless to the relationship to study vaccine were 
reported from 6/50 participants (12.0%) in the MV XBB.1.5 (1273.815) and from 9/51 participants 
(17.6%) in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (1273.231) vaccine group. Unsolicited TEAEs related to study 
vaccination were reported from 1 (2.0%) participants in the MV XBB.1.5 (1273.815) and from 3 (5.9 %) 
participants in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (1273.231) vaccine group. Of those, MAAEs were reported in 1 
(2.0%) participant in the MV XBB.1.5 and no MAAEs in the BV XBB.1.5+BA.4/5. There were no grade 3 or 
higher reported events. 
There were no events leading to discontinuation from participation in the study. There were no deaths, no 
SAEs and no AESIs reported.   
There were no clinical data on the use of the Spikevax MV XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) vaccine in 
adolescents and children and the MAH confirmed that are no ongoing studies administering mRNA-
1273.815 in adolescents and young children. The assumption of acceptable reactogenicity and safety data 
in these age groups can be based on the safety data extrapolation from the use of the Spikevax MV 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 45/48 
 
 
 
 
XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) vaccine in adults and the large amount of data from Spikevax Original and 
Spikevax bivalent adapted vaccines from the clinical studies and post marketing settings. 
The safety of Spikevax XBB.1.5 have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including 
those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. No data are available yet regarding the use of MV XBB.1.5 
during pregnancy and during breast feeding. This is acceptable for the purpose of this variation. 
XBB.1.5-containing vaccines (monovalent 1273.815, bivalent 1273.231) given as a fifth dose were well 
tolerated. Taken together, in this limited study population of 101 participants the frequency and severity 
of reported local reactions and systemic events appears to be similar to prior doses of the original mRNA-
1273 vaccine and the bivalent BA.4/BA.5 vaccine mRNA-1273.222.  
No new safety concern was detected in this small study population with a short follow up time. 
6.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the clinical safety data provided for Spikevax XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) 
is deemed acceptable. 
7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, relevant sections of the SmPC, labelling and package leaflet are being updated 
to adequately reflect the addition of a new strain (Omicron XBB.1.5, andusomeran). 
The MAH is taking the opportunity to include editorial changes into the SmPC, Annex II, labelling and 
package leaflet. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
With this type II variation, the MAH sought the introduction of a monovalent vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-
2 Omicron strain XBB.1.5 to assist in the continued management of COVID-19. This is in line with 
EMA/ECDC statement, where it was recommended that “the inclusion of a strain belonging to the XBB 
family of Omicron subvariants is adequate to ensure cross-reactivity against current dominant and 
emerging strains, and XBB.1.5 is considered as a reasonable choice to increase the breadth of immunity 
also against XBB descendent lineages”. 
The MAH has submitted a full quality data package for Omicron XBB.1.5 active substance and monovalent 
finished product formulations. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active 
substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. 
Concerning quality, the provided data are acceptable, however the manufacturing site Patheon Monza 
was withdrawn during the procedure. 
The MAH has provided mouse immunogenicity data comparing the response of the Omicron XBB.1.5 
vaccine with that of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and of the investigational bivalent Omicron 
BA.4-5/Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine for both primary series and booster. In both cases, the XBB.1.5 
containing vaccines provided a superior response to XBB.1.5 strain. The monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine 
showed a higher response than the bivalent. These data were acceptable. 
The MAH also provided clinical data related to the on-going clinical study P205 Part J, which evaluates 
safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the monovalent XBB.1.5 (mRNA 1273.815) vaccine and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/429527/2023 
Page 46/48 
 
 
 
 
bivalent XBB.1.5+BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.231) vaccine administered as a fifth dose. The use of this vaccine 
as booster vaccination increased nAb GMTs against all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, 
BA.4/BA.5, BQ.1.1 and ancestral D614G). This is suggestive of an adequate boosting response. The 
safety data provided for Spikevax MV XBB.1.5 (mRNA-1273.815) was deemed acceptable and no 
concerns were raised.   
The benefit-risk balance of Spikevax, remains positive. 
9.  Recommendations

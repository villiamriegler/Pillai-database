Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Fotivda (Tivozanib Hydrochloride) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Fotivda. The RMP details important 
risks of Fotivda, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Fotivda's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Fotivda's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Fotivda should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Fotivda should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  Fotivda's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Fotivda is authorised for the first line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC)  and  for  adult  patients  who  are  VEGFR  and  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR) 
pathway  inhibitor-naïve  following  disease  progression  after  one  prior  treatment  with  cytokine 
therapy for advanced RCC (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains Tivozanib Hydrochloride 
as the active substance and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Fotivda’s benefits can be found in Fotivda’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA) 
website,

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Fotivda, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Fotivda's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Fotivda is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Fotivda  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Fotivda. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-
term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hypertension 
 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Non-clinical: Transient increase in blood pressure after a single oral dose 
of 3 mg/kg/day was seen in monkeys. A maximum increase of 14 to 19 
mmHg was seen 90 minutes post-dose. 
Clinical trials (DLP of 20 January 2015): The overall frequency of 
hypertension TEAEs among tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients in the 
core RCC monotherapy studies was 49.4%. 
UPDATE as of DLP 23 Feb 2021: 
Clinical  trials:  The  overall  frequency  of  hypertension  TEAEs  among 
tivozanib hydrochloride-treated patients in the TIVO-3 study was 40.5%. 
Post-marketing experience (DLP of 23 Feb 2021): Cumulative data from 
the  post-marketing  experience  revealed  31  reports  of  Hypertension 
(hypertension, n=22, blood pressure increased, n=3, blood pressure diastolic 
increased n=1, hypertensive crisis n=3, hypertensive heart disease n=1, and 
accelerated hypertension=1). No new safety issues have been identified from 
these post-marketing cases.

Risk factors for venous embolic and thrombotic events include advanced 
age, race (higher prevalence in Caucasians and African Americans), and 
presence of risk factors, such as cancer, surgery, trauma, inherited 
thrombophilic states, prior VTE or ATE, obesity, cardiac or respiratory 
failure, and immobilisation (Connelly-Frost et al., 2013; Weber, 2014). 
A number of factors for VTE in malignancy have been implicated, including 
tumour-induced hypercoagulability, vascular injury from surgical treatment, 
chemotherapy, radiation, and venous stasis due to immobilisation. The risk 
did not appear to increase with added co-morbidity burden (A. B. Smith et 
al., 2014).

The potential risk groups for haemorrhage include subjects with prior

Risk of bleeding might be higher and more relevant in the older and frailer

The risk group might include patients receiving concomitant therapy with 
agents known to cause HFS, such as capecitabine, 5-FU, doxorubicin, and 
IL-2. However, according to a meta-analysis of 33 randomised studies of 
TKIs with VEGFR inhibitory activity, the risk of HFSR when such TKIs 
were used as a component of a combination regimen involving a 
conventional chemotherapeutic agent was not different from TKI use as 
monotherapy (Massey et al., 2015). 
The risk for developing HFSR or HFS depends on patient social, work and 
home life.  Patients  whose jobs  require a  significant  amount  of  walking  or 
hand friction are at greater risk of developing these skin toxicities and use of 
caustic cleaning solutions and hot water are also contributors (W. Smith & 
Abou-Alfa, 2010). Experience from clinical practice has shown that HFSR 
tends to be more severe in younger, 'more-active' patients (Edmonds et al., 
2012).

for  PRES/RPLS  include  uncontrolled  hypertension  and  non-compliance 
with anti-hypertensive treatment.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Although the risk groups and risk factors for hepatic effects are unknown, 
VEGF  inhibiting  agents,  both  TKIs  and  antibodies  have  been  found  to 
induce transaminase elevations and sometimes dose limiting hepatotoxicity 
(Eskens & Verweij, 2006).

Non-clinical: Slight to moderately severe gastric changes were seen in the 
1.0 mg/kg/day group in monkeys. These gastric changes were characterised 
microscopically by dilated gastric glands, acute inflammation, hyperplasia 
of fundic and pyloric columnar epithelium, and decreased numbers of 
parietal and chief cells. 
Clinical trials (DLP of 20 January 2015): Among tivozanib 
hydrochloride-treated patients in the core RCC monotherapy studies, the 
overall frequency of GI perforation and fistula TEAEs was less than 1% 
(1/674 [0.1%], PT = abdominal abscess); the frequency of Grade ≥ 3 GI 
perforation and fistula TEAEs was also less than 1% (1/674 [0.1%], PT = 
abdominal abscess). 
UPDATE as of DLP 23 Feb 2021: 
Clinical trials:  There was no new data pertaining to clinical trials since the

Post-marketing experience (DLP of 23 Feb 2021): Cumulative data from 
the post-marketing experience revealed 6 reports of GI perforation and 
fistula, including duodenal ulcer n=1, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastric 
ulcer, haematemesis n=1, gastric ulcer n=1, intestinal obstruction n=1, 
diverticular perforation, diverticulitis n=1, and abdominal abscess n=1. The

The risk for GI perforation and fistula may be dose-dependent, as reported 
for bevacizumab  (Hapani  et  al.,  2009).  Risk  factors postulated to  increase 
the  risk  of  spontaneous  bowel  fistula  include  the  history  of  peptic  ulcer 
disease, diverticulitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, tumour necrosis, recent 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, intact primary tumour, radiotherapy, higher 
cumulative dose, or emergency surgery while receiving bevacizumab (Abu-
Hejleh et al., 2012).

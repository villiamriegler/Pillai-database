2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is characterised by high levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 
23 (FGF23) that leads to excessive urinary phosphate excretion and subsequent hypophosphataemia, 
resulting in defective bone mineralisation and impacts to other tissues such as muscle. The major 
pathologic consequences of XLH in bone are rickets, osteomalacia, fractures and bone deformities 
requiring surgical intervention. XLH in children is associated with substantial skeletal deformities that 
cause pain and impair physical functioning, such that a young child may be severely limited in his/her 
daily activities and will suffer lifelong disability, social stigmatisation, and pain as these deformities 
become a permanent structure of their bones. In adults, the chronic osteomalacia often leads to 
development of short stature, bowed limbs, pathologic fractures and pseudofractures, early osteoarthritis, 
and enthesopathies, which cause stiffness, and pain requiring use of analgesic drugs. These impairments 
may limit physical function and impact quality of life.   
Conventional therapy for XLH consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with 
active vitamin D. Evidence of a positive effect of this therapy is limited and treatment can be 
cumbersome, and compliance is challenging. Furthermore, multiple daily doses of oral phosphate produce 
a transient and intermittent increase in serum phosphorus (Glorieux et al, 1980) that can exacerbate 
phosphate wasting because the impairment in renal phosphate reabsorption is not addressed. This 
intermittent phosphate load triggers high urinary phosphate excretion and increases risk and progression 
of nephrocalcinosis, which occurred in as many as 50%-100% of treated patients (Goodyer et al, 1987; 
Verge et al, 1991; Kooh et al, 1994; Carpenter et al, 2011; Sabbagh et al, 2008), and also in adolescents 
who would have received shorter periods of oral therapy (Zhukouskaya et al, 2019). Awareness of this 
safety risk led to the implementation of less aggressive, lower phosphate dosing strategies to reduce the 
risk of nephrocalcinosis in patients with XLH (Carpenter et al, 2011; Rafaelsen et al, 2016; Carpenter, 
1997). 
Burosumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the 
excessive biological activity of FGF23, thereby treating the underlying cause of XLH. The European 
Commission granted a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Crysvita on 19 Feb 2018, for the 
treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children ≥1 year of age and adolescents 
with growing skeletons (Authorisation No. EU/1/17/1262).  
On 17 Apr 2018, burosumab was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults and children with 
XLH aged 1 year and older. Since approval in the EU and the US, burosumab has also been approved with 
the same indication in Canada (05 Dec 2018), the United Arab Emirates (12 Feb 2019) and Brazil (26 Mar 
2019). 
In the original MAA in the EU, the MAH pursued the adult indication, but subsequently elected to withdraw 
the application due to lack of sufficient data in adults at the time. The MAH now applies for an extension 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

of the currently approved indication to include also adults and adolescents who have attained peak 
vertical height or with closed growth plates.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has submitted a justification for omitting an environmental risk assessment. According to 
the guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acid, peptides and proteins are exempted since they are unlikely to 
result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, the justification provided is considered 
acceptable.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the characteristics of the active substance, burosumab is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the current variation, the focus will be on the burosumab PK and PD data in adult XLH 
patients. Data are available from seven adult clinical trials, KRN23-US-02, KRN23-001, KRN23-INT-001, 
KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL203, UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304. To support the characterisation of 
burosumab PK and PK/PD, modelling and simulations were performed using data from the 
aforementioned adult studies, and PK and PD data from paediatric XLH patients, who were enrolled in 
three clinical trials UX023-CL201, UX023-CL205, and UX023-CL301. Further, modelling using data from 
these studies were used to support dosing in adolescent patients who have XLH.  
In summary, following single or repeat dose SC administrations, burosumab serum concentrations 
displayed an approximate mono-exponential decline. Apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) values, e.g., 
394 hours approximately 16 days, after repeat SC administrations in Study KRN23-INT-001). Dose-linear, 
time-invariant PK were observed within a repeat SC dose range of 0.05-1.0 mg/kg. The absolute 
bioavailability from SC administration was determined to be approximately 100%.  
Analytical methods 
No new data regarding the comparability of formulations and the pharmacokinetic (PK) and neutralizing 
antibody (Nab) assays have been generated, which is acceptable. Assays to measure burosumab 
concentrations in serum (PK), and to evaluate immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADA]) and total and 
free (unbound) FGF23, serum phosphorus and bone turnover markers were described in the initial MAA. 
The updated assay methodology employed to detect ADA using an assay method with an increased drug 
tolerance limit is described below. 
Immunogenicity 
The method development approach taken for the new assay for ADA was dependent on the concept of 
separating the burosumab-ADA antibody complex and then assaying the resulting free ADA. This 
separation was accomplished in multiple steps: acidification and neutralization of the serum sample to 
free ADA from burosumab, immobilization of ADA by burosumab bound to solid phase bead, followed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 12/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
washing and extraction of ADA from the bead by acid dissociation, and final neutralization in storage 
buffer. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A unified population PK model was first developed for all study subjects from the 2 paediatric studies, and 
5 adult studies. Second updated analyses were conducted, which included additional longitudinal data 
from UX023-CL303 and subjects from adult study UX023-CL304 and paediatric study UX023-CL301. 
These studies included 94 children ≤12 years of age (6 subjects <2 years, 88 subjects 2-12 years of age) 
and 183 unique adult subjects. In total, the dataset for the population analysis included 2844 measurable 
serum concentrations of burosumab (PK) and 6047 measurable concentrations of serum phosphorus (PD) 
collected in 277 unique XLH trial subjects. The dose range studied ranged from 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg by SC 
administration, and two dosing frequencies (Q2W and Q4W) were included. The clinical trials included in 
the PK and PK/PD modelling analyses are summarised in Table 5.

Non-Linear Mixed Effect (NLME) population PK and PK/PD analyses were performed using Phoenix NLME 
v8 (Pharsight – A Certara Company). Dataset exploration, figures and tables, as well as posterior Bayes 
estimation of parameter values for individual subjects were performed using R V3.5 with comprehensive 
R archive network (CRAN) and Certara Strategic Consulting (CSC) package. 
The PK of burosumab were described using a model with SC absorption with first-order kinetics, one-
compartment distribution post absorption, and concentration-independent and time-invariant clearance 
from circulation. Hypothesis of non-linear clearance of burosumab in the form of Michaelis-Menten 
kinetics was specifically tested and rejected due to deterioration in model fitting.  
In the original combined paediatric and adult model using 7 studies, the body weight (WT) based 
allometric scaling of CL/F and V/F was incorporated in the model, and the data estimated allometric 
scalars were 0.89 and 1.0, respectively, supporting body weight normalised dosing of burosumab. 
Evaluated covariates included sex, ethnicity/race, country of clinical trials (including the US and Japan), 
status of anti-burosumab antibody, time-varying intact FGF23, baseline ALB, baseline ALP, baseline ALT,

baseline creatinine and baseline CRCL. Baseline levels of creatinine clearance (CRCL) were derived based 
on Schwartz equation for paediatric population and based on Cockcroft and Gault equation for adult 
population. Search for significant covariates also included types of PHEX mutation of subjects, which are 
categorised into 3 classes: (1) pathogenic mutations and likely pathogenic mutations; (2) variants of 
uncertain significance; and (3) likely benign and no mutation. After including the WT effects on CL/F and 
V/F, no other covariates were found to be significant predictor of burosumab disposition. A step-wise 
covariate model building procedure was used. Table 11 summarises estimated burosumab population PK 
parameters in XLH patients. 
The updated model included additional data from UX023-CL303, and subject data from adult study 
UX023-CL304 and paediatric study UX023-CL301. A summary of the data included in the updated model 
development (i.e. all PK data used in the population PK analysis) is presented in Table 6, Table 7, Table 
8, and Table 9. Serum concentrations of burosumab reported as BLQ (i.e., <36 and <50 ng/mL, 
depending of the study) were flagged and set to missing for the population PK analysis of XLH population.

The inclusion of the additional data resulted in minor changes to the primary parameter estimates. The 
exponents in the allometric power function of effect of WT on CL/F and V/F (i.e., [WT/70]effect) were 
estimated to be 0.877 and 0.972, respectively, and the 95% CI of the exponent of V/F included 1. The 
other change to the model structure was the simplification of the model through the elimination of the 
IOV effect due to high shrinkage and the incorporation of an additive plus proportional residual error 
model. In the modelling exercise, no new covariates were identified. Further, age or age population was 
not a significant covariate to influence burosumab PK, after the effect of WT had been included in the 
structural PK model. Table 11 summarises estimated burosumab population PK parameters in XLH 
patients using the updated model. Given the similarities in the results of the modelling exercises,

simulations supporting adolescent dosing and exposure-response investigation provided below were 
conducted using the original PK model. The estimated elimination t1/2 is slightly dependent on body 
weight and ranges from ~ 16 days for a typical young paediatric subject of 1-4 years old to ~ 19 days for 
a typical adult subject.

Population PK analysis (Report ULTR-PMX-1280) 
A total of 277 patients (6 infants, 88 children and 183 adults) with XLH treated with burosumab were 
included in the population PK analysis. Descriptive statistics of demographic data and serum chemistry of 
included subjects are described. The current analysis adds longer follow-up PK and PD data from subjects 
in Studies UX203-CL201 and UX203-CL303, and updated immunogenicity data in Studies UX023-CL205, 
UX023-CL201 and UX203-CL303 for antidrug (burosumab) antibodies (ADA) based on an improved assay 
method. 
The total number of serum concentrations available for the development of the population PK model of 
burosumab is presented in the table below. All BLQ and ALQ samples were excluded from the analysis.

Amongst patients with immunogenicity information (not available in Study KRN23-US-02), a total of 48 
unique subjects had at least one sample with confirmed presence of ADA. Among these 48 subjects, due 
to the conservative cut-off of ADA assays, 33 subjects had positive ADA in serum samples collected 
before the 1st burosumab dose. Only 3 patients in Study UX023-CL201, had samples with positive NAb. 
Most of the patients had only one or two samples with confirmed presence of ADA followed by 
seroreversion (i.e., from ADA positive to negative). Only a few patients had more than two samples with 
confirmed presence of ADA. 
A previously developed one-compartment model with body weight (WT) based allometric functions on 
CL/F and V/F along with a first-order rate of absorption from SC injection sites was used as the starting 
point.  
Impact of ADA and NAb status on PK parameters of burosumab were formally evaluated with the 
following three approaches: 
• 
• 
• 
Time-invariant approach: Subjects were flagged as positive if at least one of their ADA sample 
had detectable ADA; other subjects were flagged as negative. 
Time-varying approach: PK samples and dose events were flagged as positive if ADA sample 
collected during the same day had detectable ADA or NAb, and were flagged as negative if no 
detectable ADA or NAb. Last-observation carried forward was applied for days without ADA 
sample. 
Time-latent approach: Introduce a latent variable ρ which is a continuous variable set to 0 for all 
negative ADA and NAb samples, and set to 1 for positive samples. At time points between 
measurements, a sigmoid function with estimated onset and offset times was used to interpolate 
ρ as a function of time. 
For each of the three analysis methods, the presence of ADA did not have statistically significant influence 
on burosumab clearance. Due to the small number (N=3) of subjects who tested positive for NAb, a 
statistically meaningful analysis of NAb as an independent potential PK covariate is not possible. 
The population mean parameter estimates (based on a representative XLH subject of 70 kg) and their 
associated uncertainties are presented in Table 9. The diagnostic plots and VPC plots are provided in 
Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively.

Effect of Anti-drug Antibodies on Burosumab PK 
The impact of immunogenicity, as assessed in the improved ADA assay, was evaluated by incorporating 
the ADA data into integrated population PK model burosumab. The dataset set used in the population PK 
analysis, presented above, was updated with the improved immunogenicity data in Studies UX023-CL205, 
UX023-CL201 and UX203-CL303. A total of 48 unique subjects tested positive for ADA at any time during 
the studies including at pretreatment baseline. Among these subjects, 15 subjects developed de novo 
ADA induced by burosumab after their first exposures to burosumab treatment, and 33 subjects had 
positive ADA status before receiving their first dose of burosumab, likely reflecting the presence of pre-
existing cross-reactive antibodies. Figure 4 represents individual profiles of titer levels in patients with at 
least one positive ADA samples stratified by study and status of ADA at baseline before the first dose of 
burosumab.

Studies UX023-CL201 and U023-CL303 
The impact of ADA status on burosumab PK was evaluated in the population model using 3 different 
methods of analysis (ie, treating ADA as time-invariant, time-variant or time-latent covariate). In the 
combined 48 study subjects with at least 1 positive ADA sample during any time of studies, the mean 
values of CL/F (0.315 L/day) and V/F (6.81 L) were moderately greater than the corresponding values for 
the 229 subjects tested negative in ADA status (ie, 23% and 5.3% higher in CL/F and V/F, respectively). 
The difference between the ADA positive and negative groups further decreased after normalising 
individual values with the respective body weight (ie, 16.3% and 1.8% higher in weight-adjusted CL/F 
and V/F, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, the 15 subjects who tested ADA positive after the first 
burosumab administration had mean CL/F and V/F values similar to those of the 221 subjects who 
maintained negative ADA status during the clinical studies, suggesting seroconversion of ADA status had 
no effect on burosumab disposition. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
XLH is a rare, genetic disorder characterised by hypophosphatemia driven by excess fibroblast growth 
factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 is a specific regulator of serum phosphorus; its major function is to reduce 
serum phosphorus levels by inhibiting renal proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption. FGF23 also 
decreases serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] levels by inhibiting 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity 
in the kidney, thereby decreasing intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium. Both actions by FGF23 
on the tubular reabsorption and intestinal absorption of phosphate via vitamin D metabolism decrease 
serum phosphorus levels.

Mechanism of action 
Burosumab (Crysvita) is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits 
the excessive biological activity of FGF23. By inhibiting FGF23, burosumab is intended to restore tubular 
reabsorption of phosphate from the kidney and increase the production of 1,25(OH)2D, which enhances 
intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Together, these actions improve serum phosphorus levels 
and bone mineralisation. XLH disease characteristics are summarised in Figure 5.

Blue text indicates associated endpoints assessed in the adult clinical development programme for burosumab. Note that assessments of mobility (the

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
As the pharmacodynamic marker serum phosphorus is the primary endpoint in the main adult clinical 
study UX023-CL303, the effect of burosumab on pharmacodynamics is discussed in the Clinical efficacy 
section.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The population PK/PD analysis was based on simulated burosumab PK profiles in individual subjects using 
the original PK model and time-matched, baseline-subtracted serum phosphate level as the PD endpoint. 
Table 12 summarises the number of individual data points of serum phosphorus levels stratified by the 
age group available for the development of the population PK/PD model in subjects with XLH. Overall, a 
total of 6047 measurable concentrations of serum phosphorus were available for the development of the 
population PK/PD model in subjects with XLH, which is approximately 2-fold the number of PK samples 
included in the population PK analysis (Table 6). The serum phosphorus concentrations collected in the 
paediatric patients represented ~33% of the overall PD dataset of the PK/PD analysis. The results from 
the combination of data from the 7 studies in the original modelling and as well as the results using data 
from the 9 studies are presented below. 
Table 10 Number of Serum Phosphorus Samples Available for the Population PK/PD Modelling 
During the trials, serum phosphorus levels were measured more frequently than burosumab 
concentrations. In order to retain all observed serum phosphorus data and allow a good estimation of the 
effect of time on the PK/PD relationship, serum phosphorus concentrations were paired with their time-
matched simulation of PK concentrations. Individual PK parameters derived with the final population PK 
model of burosumab and the actual dosing history were used to simulate burosumab concentrations 
(simCKRN23) to pair with the observed phosphorus levels. 
Figure 6 present the relationship between the serum phosphorus change from baseline and individual 
predicted burosumab concentrations. These figures show that the Emax of burosumab on serum 
phosphate change from baseline is approximately between 1-2 mg/dL and half of the maximum effect is 
observed around burosumab concentrations of ~ 5000 ng/mL. The PD effect appears to approach 
saturation at the burosumab concentration threshold of ~10,000 ng/mL.

Figure 5 Relationship between Serum Phosphorus Change from Baseline and Individual Predicted 
Concentrations of Burosumab in Adult and Paediatric Subjects with XLH – Based on 9 Studies 
A standard, sigmoidal Emax model was used to describe the observed serum phosphate responses 
following various regimens of burosumab SC treatment. A moderate but statistically significant effect of 
body weight on baseline (E0) and maximal (Emax) were incorporated for improved model fitting as well 
as physiological plausibility and clinical observation. These observations included lower serum phosphorus 
level with increased age in normal subjects, and the few cases of hyperphosphataemia only being 
observed in adult XLH subjects treated with burosumab, which supports the selection of an Emax model. 
The original PK/PD model was presented in the initial MAA. Table 13 and Table 14 summarise the typical 
population PD parameter values estimated from the original and updated model, respectively. 
Using the original integrated PK and PK/PD modelling, the estimated typical value of EC50 was 5783 
ng/mL, which is independent of subject’s age, body weight or the time on burosumab treatment. The 
updated model has lower estimates for EC50 (4606 ng/mL) and Emax (1.65 [mg/dL]/[ng/mL]). Using the 
previously predicted exposures and the new model estimates, the estimated percentage of Emax would 
be similar to the previous estimates. The modelling results are consistent with observed clinical efficacy in 
the paediatric and adult XLH trials and support the recommended dosing frequencies of Q2W and Q4W in 
the two populations respectively.

The relationship between individual predicted burosumab concentrations and serum phosphorus change 
from baseline observed in the 269 patients included in the population PK/PD analysis is presented in 
Figure 8. This figure shows that the Emax of change in serum phosphorus from burosumab treatment is 
greater than 1 mg/dL and half of the maximum effect is observed around burosumab concentrations of 
5000 ng/mL, i.e., the EC50 value. Approximately homogeneous distributions of the adult and paediatric 
data points were observed with slightly higher maximum effect in adults. 
The previous PK/PD model developed with data from paediatric and adult subjects with XLH (report ULTR-
CSC-106) was used as a starting point to evaluate the relationship between burosumab and serum 
phosphorus concentrations in the current dataset including longer following-up in Studies UX023-CL201 
and UC023-CL303. As with the previous model, the structural PK/PD parameters in the current model 
included E0, EC50, Emax, as well as BSV associated with these parameters. Hill coefficient (ɣ fixed to 1, 2 
or estimated value), unexplained residual error models (i.e., proportional and mixed error models) and 
the time-varying WT effect on E0 and Emax were evaluated to determine the structural population PK 
model. The best structural model was obtained with WT effect on E0 only, with estimated value for the 
Hill coefficient and a mixed residual error model. 
The inclusion of serum ALP on Emax resulted in a marked decrease in MOF value with a reduction of 2.0% 
of BSV on Emax. After incorporating WT on E0 and ALP on Emax as a structural model covariate, no other 
significant trends were detected with other potential covariates. 
The point estimates with associated uncertainties for the typical population values of PK/PD parameters 
derived from the final model are presented in Table 10. Diagnostic plots for the final population PK/PD 
model are presented in Figure 11. VPC plots stratified by age population are shown in Figure 12.

A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between serum phosphorus at baseline and 
time-varying WT, with point estimate of -0.128. This is consistent with inverse relationship between 
serum phosphorus level and age in healthy children and the general understanding that higher phosphate 
metabolism is needed to support faster bone growth in younger population. A statistically significant 
negative correlation was observed between Emax and serum ALP with point estimate of -0.110. The 
average trough burosumab concentration of 15,000 ng/mL observed in Studies UX023-CL201 would 
result in ~90.0% of Emax, which corresponds to serum phosphorus levels of 3.62 mg/dL and 3.38 mg/dL 
based on the median values of WT and ALP for infants and children, respectively. 
Effect of Anti-drug Antibodies on Burosumab PK/PD 
The impact of immunogenicity, as assessed in the improved ADA assay, was evaluated by incorporating 
the ADA data into integrated population PK model burosumab. The dataset set used in the population PK 
analysis, presented above, was updated with the improved immunogenicity data in Studies UX023-CL205, 
UX023-CL201 and UX203-CL303. A total of 48 unique subjects tested positive for ADA at any time during 
the studies including at pretreatment baseline. Among these subjects, 15 subjects developed de novo 
ADA induced by burosumab after their first exposures to burosumab treatment, and 33 subjects had 
positive ADA status before receiving their first dose of burosumab, likely reflecting the presence of pre-
existing cross-reactive antibodies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 35/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The posterior Bayes parameters of EC50 and Emax obtained in the 48 subjects positive for ADA were 
moderately higher than those obtained in subjects with negative ADA status (i.e., mean values were 25% 
and 15% higher, respectively), and the magnitude of these differences are unlikely to be clinically 
important. In the subgroup analysis, the 15 subjects who tested positive for ADA after the first 
burosumab administration had essentially identical mean EC50 and Emax values compared with the 221 
subjects who maintained negative ADA status during the clinical studies, suggesting seroconversion of 
ADA status had no effect on burosumab PD.   
Simulations to Support Dosing Regimens of Burosumab XLH Subjects 
The paediatric XLH subjects enrolled in Studies UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL205 were aged 5-12 years 
old and 1-4 years old at screening, respectively, and did not include the adolescent population (age range 
of 13-17 years old). The unified PK and PK/PD models are based on observed PK and PD data in both 
adult and paediatric XLH subjects and should be applicable to the adolescent age group; therefore, 
modelling and simulations is used to support the dose regimen for this age population of XLH patients. It 
is noted that body weight is the only structural covariate incorporated in the population PK and PK/PD 
models. Therefore, body weights of adolescent subjects with XLH were modeled using a General Additive 
Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) based on the actual baseline body weight distributions 
observed in paediatric (1-<12 years old) and adult (18-<69 years old) subjects included in the population 
PK and PK/PD analyses. Simulations of the GAMLSS model were then performed by randomly generating 
body weight values in 100,000 adolescent XLH subjects from 12-17 years of age, inclusively. The 
distribution of body weight in adolescent XLH populations is presented in Figure 9. To avoid outliers, body 
weight values included in the 90% CI of generated body weight were retained in the virtual population of 
adolescents.

Figure 8 Distribution of Body Weight in the Virtual Populations and in the Population Included in the 
Population PK and PK/PD Analyses in Subjects with XLH 
The original population PK/PD model was used to simulate exposure to burosumab and serum 
phosphorous for the two dosing regimens recommended for paediatrics and adults, i.e., 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
and 1.0 mg/kg Q4W, respectively. A virtual XLH adolescent population was simulated by sampling the 
body weight of subjects included in the virtual adolescent population (n = ~1000 XLH subjects per dosing 
regimen). The time-profiles of burosumab, serum phosphorus (absolute and change from baseline) at 
steady-state were derived for a duration of four weeks. 
Descriptive statistics of minimum, average and maximum levels of burosumab concentrations, serum 
phosphorus and change from baseline from the simulations are presented in Table 15.

Table 13 Descriptive Statistics of Predicted PK and PD in XLH Adolescent Subjects (Dose Levels Rounded 
to the Nearest 10 mg with Maximum of 90 mg) 
For 0.8 mg/kg Q2W and 1.0 mg/kg Q4W dosing regimens, there were ~ 51% and 65% of the simulated 
minimum of serum phosphorus levels lower than 3.2 mg/dL (the lower bound of normal serum phosphate 
range), respectively, whereas only 2.9% and 3.3% of the simulated maximum of serum phosphorus 
levels were higher than 5.0 mg/dL (the upper bound of normal serum phosphate range), respectively. In 
clinical practice, burosumab administration is to be titrated to normal phosphate range. Since the 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen is predicted to afford a higher probability for patients to achieve at least 3.2 
mg/dL serum phosphate, the lower bound of normal range, it is recommended that the adolescent XLH 
patients should receive the same dose for other paediatric patients aged 1-12 years old, burosumab 0.8 
mg/kg Q2W. 
Exposure Response (Efficacy and Safety) Relationship 
Exposure-Response (ER) analysis for efficacy has been conducted for serum phosphorus change in the 
form of population PK/PD analysis, described above. 
ER analysis for safety was evaluated for the events of hyperphosphataemia. For the purpose of this 
analysis, hyperphosphataemia was defined as observation of serum phosphorus level >4.5 mg/dL from 
one or more lab measurements. No hyperphosphataemia was observed in any paediatric XLH subjects. 
Out of the 12 adult XLH subjects (11 from Study UX023-CL303 and 1 from Study UX023-CL203) who had 
at least 1 observation of hyperphosphataemia, 5 subjects had serum phosphorus level >4.5 mg/dL from 
repeat measurements.  Burosumab serum exposures were compared between these 12 subjects versus

those from adult XLH subjects who did not have hyperphosphataemia. PK exposure (Cmax, Cmin and 
AUC) distributions demonstrated overlap between the two groups with similar median values (Figure 10); 
hence, the occurrence of hyperphosphataemia did not have any apparent association with burosumab 
serum exposures.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
An improved bioanalysis method for the detection of anti-burosumab antibodies have been developed. 
The MAH has provided evidence that the cutpoint and subsequent analysis are adequate.  
The pharmacokinetics of burosumab was reported in the initiall MAA. For the purpose of further describing 
the burosumab PK in the adult population, an updated population PK integrated analysis has been 
presented with the inclusion of additional data from studies UX023-CL303, UX023-CL304, and paediatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

study UX023-CL301. Graphical comparison of the distributions of observed burosumab exposure, across 
all age groups, indicate that the adult population have a somewhat lower exposure compared to the 
paediatric population. This is expected, as the dose in adults is approximately halved compared to 
children. 
The updated PK model displayed minor differences from the previously reported PK model, and hence the 
previously reported PK properties of burosumab withstand. The previously reported PK model was used 
for simulations to support the recommended dosing strategy.  
In the population PK model, estimated allometric exponents for the body weight relationships were used. 
Although it is often recommended to use fixed theoretical exponents, the Applicant showed in the initial 
MAA that there were minor differences in the population predictions between estimated and fixed 
exponents, favouring the estimated values. Thus, estimated exponents were accepted. 
The relationship between burosumab serum concentration and observed phosphorus levels was described 
with a direct effect Emax model. As in the initial MAA, time-matched simulated serum concentration levels 
were imputed where observed serum concentrations were missing. The original model was assessed in 
the MAA and only minor changes were made in the updated analysis, which are accepted. The analysis 
identified a large inter-individual variability in the EC50 value, i.e. the concentration to achieve 50% of 
the maximum effect. This finding supports the need for dose titration to achieve an adequate phosphorus 
level for all patients.  
The predicted burosumab exposures between the children 2-12 years and the adolescent population are 
comparable, and the adult burosumab exposure ranges are decreased by half compared to the paediatric 
populations. This is expected as the dose is approximately halved going from 0.8 mg/kg Q2W to 1 mg/kg 
Q4W. According to the PKPD analysis, the serum phosphorus levels are similar across age groups with the 
proposed posology indicating that a switch from 0.8 mg/kg Q2W to 1 mg/kg QW4 would be acceptable. 
With regard to the burosumab exposure range for patients >90 kg, the MAH has provided a comparison 
between the full adult XLH patient population and patients >90. Comparing the observed phosphorus 
levels there are minor differences between patients >90 kg and <90 kg. It should be noted, however, 
that only 9 patients weighed >90 kg. Although it would have been valuable to have the exposure ranges 
presented <90 kg and >90 kg, the phosphorus levels seem to indicate that no dose adjustment for 
patients >90 kg is warranted. The MAH has proposed a dosing regimen of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W in the 
adolescent patient population and a 1 mg/kg Q4W dosing regimen in the adult population. As indicated by 
the predictions from PKPD model, the average phosphorus levels will remain largely the same although 
with greater fluctuations. The predicted peak to trough serum exposure ratios in adolescents are 1.33-
fold and 2.13-fold for the burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W and burosumab 1.0 mg/kg Q4W regimens, 
respectively, which translates to ratios of 1.06-fold and 1.24-fold for the change from baseline of serum 
phosphorus, and 1.03-fold and 1.10-fold for serum phosphate for these regimens, respectively. The 
applicant argues that by the age of 18 years, the importance of the fluctuations is lower as bone growth 
and maturity begins to slow relative to the early adolescent development. The justification for the dose 
switch to the adult dose at 18 years of age is acceptable as the average phosphorus levels are largely 
maintained. 
As the pharmacodynamic marker serum phosphorus is the primary endpoint in the main adult clinical 
study UX023-CL303, the effect of burosumab on pharmacodynamics is discussed in the Clinical efficacy 
section.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK and PK/PD analyses have been provided to support the dosing recommendations in the 
adolescent and adult populations. No major differences between the paediatric and adult populations 
were identified. The average phosphorus levels are largely similar across age and bodyweight, hence the 
proposed dosing recommendation is endorsed.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The interventional studies of burosumab that contribute to the assessment of efficacy are listed in Table 1 
(paediatric population) and Table 2 (adult population). 
The efficacy of burosumab in adults with XLH was evaluated in two Phase 3 studies (UX023-CL303 and 
UX023-CL304), two Phase 1/2 adult studies (KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002), and one long-term 
Phase 2b extension, Study UX023-CL203, for which a Week 48 analysis has been completed. 
Study KRN23-INT-001 was the first multiple dose study in adult patients. Patients who satisfactorily 
completed this study could enter KRN23-INT-002. Patients from these studies entered the long-term 
extension study UX023-CL203. 
The primary evidence of burosumab efficacy in adults with XLH comes from Study UX023-CL303. 
Supportive efficacy data are provided from Study UX023-CL304, Study UX023-CL203 and the two Phase 
1/2 studies.  
In the approved paediatric posology, burosumab is administered every second week (Q2W). The applicant 
has not explored a Q2W dosing in adult patients and has conducted all clinical studies with a Q4W 
administration. 
Baseline demographic data for all studies are given in Table 16

Study Design 
KRN23-INT-001 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study designed to assess the 
safety and efficacy of repeat-dose burosumab subcutaneous (SC) administration in adult subjects with 
XLH. The study also evaluated the effects of repeat-dose burosumab SC administration on 
pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and HRQoL.  
Eligible subjects were at least 18 years of age with a documented clinical diagnosis of XLH, intact FGF23 
level >30 pg/mL, TmP/GFR <2.0 mg/dL and corrected serum calcium level <10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L].  
A total of 32 adult subjects with XLH, of whom 18 had participated in single-dose Study KRN23-US-02, 
were assigned to treatment (30 subjects to burosumab in the open-label portion of the study and 2 
subjects in the bone substudy [one to burosumab and one to placebo]). The KRN23-INT-001 bone sub-
study was subsequently terminated due to slow accrual. As three subjects assigned to burosumab 
treatment were discontinued before receiving the first dose, 28 subjects were treated with burosumab in 
the study.  
Each of the subjects was administered up to 4 SC doses of burosumab at 28-day intervals using a 
stepwise dose-escalation from 0.05 mg/kg → 0.1 mg/kg → 0.3 mg/kg →0.6 mg/kg that was guided by 
individual serum phosphorus levels using a dose-escalation algorithm and other safety observations. The 
treatment duration was up to 110 days (Figure 11). 
Figure 10: Study design KRN23-INT-001 
Baseline Characteristics 
Please refer to Table 16  
Exposure 
A total of 28 subjects were treated with burosumab (27 in the open-label portion of the study and 1 in the 
bone substudy) and 1 subject was treated with placebo in the bone substudy. One subject (treated with 
burosumab) had a TEAE (injection site urticaria) that led to study drug discontinuation. This is further 
discussed in the Safety section.  
The planned stepwise dose-escalation in study KRN23-INT-001 (0.05 mg/kg → 0.1 mg/kg → 0.3 mg/kg 
→0.6 mg/kg) was guided by individual serum phosphorus levels using a dose-escalation algorithm and 
other safety observations. 
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) total dose of burosumab administered was 0.05 ± 0.00 mg/kg, 0.10 
± 0.01 mg/kg, 0.28 ± 0.06 mg/kg, and 0.48 ± 0.16 mg/kg during dosing intervals 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively.  
Most (92.9%, 26 subjects) subjects treated with KRN23 received all 4 doses of KRN23; 1 subject received 
3 doses and 1 subject received 1 dose. The single subject in the placebo group in the bone substudy 
received all 4 doses of placebo.

Primary Efficacy endpoint - Serum Phosphorus Levels 
The number and percentage of subjects with maximum serum phosphorus levels ≤2.5 mg/dL [0.81 
mmol/L], >2.5 to ≤3.5 mg/dL [0.81-1.13 mmol/L], >3.5 to ≤4.5 mg/dL [1.13-1.45 mmol/L], and > 4.5 
mg/dL [1.45 mmol/L] by study visit are presented in Table 17. Normal range for serum phosphorus in 
adults is 2.5-4.5 mg/dL [0.81-1.45 mmol/L].

Pharmacodynamic endpoints 
The results from the pharmacodynamic endpoints Mean serum phosphorus, renal tubular maximum 
reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) and Mean serum 1,25(OH)2D are 
shown in Figure 13 for both studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002 
Serum markers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BALP], procollagen type 1 N-
Terminal Propeptide [P1NP] and osteocalcin) and bone resorption (CTx and CTx/creatinine) tended to 
increase after burosumab dosing. 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) 
Two PRO instruments (SF-36v2 and WOMAC) were used in the study.

Study Design 
This was a Phase 1/2, open-label, repeat-dose, multicentre, long-term extension study in adults with a 
clinical diagnosis of XLH who satisfactorily completed Study KRN23-INT-001. 
The study was designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of repeat-dose burosumab SC 
administration and its effects on PD, PK, immunogenicity, and HRQoL in these subjects. 
The study consisted of 2 periods: On-treatment and Follow-up. At baseline of the On-treatment period, 
subjects were evaluated for eligibility to participate in this extension study. Eligible subjects were allowed 
to continue treatment with burosumab in the open-label portion of this extension study (Figure 12). 
Figure 11: Study design KRN23-INT-002 
The initial burosumab dose in this extension study was administered at the baseline visit (Visit 1) and was 
the same burosumab dose that the subject received on Day 84 in Study KRN23-INT-001, unless the 
subject's serum phosphorus level was >3.5 mg/dL [1.13 mmol/L] on Day 110 in Study KRN23-INT-001 or 
the peak serum phosphorus level was ≥4.2 mg/dL [1.36 mmol/L]. In such case, the subject's initial 
burosumab dose in the current study was reduced one dose level.  
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
Please refer to Table 16. 
Two subjects, both treated with KRN23, were discontinued from the study KRN23-INT-002 due to TEAEs 
(nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis and restless legs syndrome). This is further discussed in the Safety 
section.  
Exposure 
A total of 22 subjects were treated with burosumab (21 in the open-label portion of the study and 1 in the 
bone substudy) and 1 subject was treated with placebo in the bone substudy. In this study, subjects 
received up to 12 SC doses of KRN23 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 mg/kg once every 28 days. 
Burosumab was administered to each subject in the range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/kg in all dosing intervals 
except for Dose Interval 10, when the range was 0.10 to 1.00 mg/kg.  
In the initial dosing interval in the study (Dose Interval 1), the mean ± SD burosumab dose was 0.54 ± 
0.20 mg/kg, and the median was 0.60 mg/kg. In subsequent dosing intervals, mean burosumab dose 
was increased and varied in a narrow range (0.73 ± 0.28 mg/kg to 0.88 ± 0.22 mg/kg).  
Results 
Efficacy endpoint - Serum Phosphorus Levels 
The primary efficacy endpoint in KRN23-INT-002 was the number and percentage of subjects with post-
dose serum phosphorus levels ≤2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L], >2.5 to ≤3.5 mg/dL [0.81-1.13 mmol/L], 
>3.5 to ≤4.5 mg/dL [1.13-1.45 mmol/L], and >4.5 mg/dL [1.45 mmol/L].

At Baseline, all subjects had serum phosphorus levels <2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]. During each 28-day 
dosing interval in KRN23-INT-002, maximum serum phosphorus levels were achieved on Day 7 or 14 for 
subjects treated with burosumab. The minimum and maximum reported number of subjects (%) in each 
serum phosphorus category for each relative day in dosing intervals 2-12 compared to the first dosing 
interval is summarised in Table 18.

Peak and trough fluctuations of mean serum phosphorus were low throughout the study. The difference 
between mean peak and trough serum phosphorus levels for 12 available peak-trough pairs ranged from 
10%-21%. Inter-subject variability for peak and trough fluctuations of serum phosphorus levels were also 
low (11%-19% for 12 available peak-trough pairs).  
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The Minimally Important Change (MIC) is the smallest change over time in an individual patient’s score 
that represents a clinically relevant change in their health status. Using a distributional approach with a 
US general population sample, MICs have been established for the SF-36v2 as: PF, 3.5 points; Role-
Physical, 3.2; Bodily Pain, 4.5; General Health, 5.7; Vitality, 5.5; Social Functioning, 5.0; Role-Emotional, 
3.8; Mental Health, 5.5; PCS, 3.1; and MCS, 3.8. The User’s Manual for the WOMAC lists MICs as 9.7 for 
Pain, 10.0 for Stiffness, and 9.3 for Physical Functioning.

paricalcitol) within 14 days prior to SV2 
2.  Use of oral phosphate within 14 days prior to SV2 
3.  Use of aluminium hydroxide antacids, acetazolamides, and thiazides within 7 days prior to SV2 
4.  Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids defined as more than 10 days in the 2 months prior to 
SV1 
5.  Corrected serum calcium level ≥10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) at SV2 
6.  Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) ≥ 2.5 x ULN at SV1 
7.  Use of medication to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH; cinacalcet for example) within 60 days

8.  Use of bisphosphonates in the 2 years prior to SV1 
9.  Use of denosumab in the 6 months prior to SV1 
10. Use of teriparatide in the 2 months prior to SV1 
Treatments 
During the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period, subjects randomized to burosumab was to receive 1.0 
mg/kg of burosumab administered via SC injection Q4W (28 days), and subjects randomized to placebo 
received placebo administered via SC injection Q4W. 
During the Treatment Continuation Period and Treatment Extension Period, all subjects was to receive 1.0 
mg/kg of burosumab administered via SC injection Q4W. 
The MAH presents the following arguments for using placebo as control instead of conventional therapy: 
A double-blind, active-comparator design would be very difficult given the differences in the method of 
administration (oral vs SC injection for burosumab) and individualized dosing (Linglart et al. 2014), 
(Carpenter 2012). Furthermore, because there is no consensus regarding its use in adults, treatment with 
oral phosphate and active vitamin D typically stops in adolescence; however, many adults experience 
long-term complications from the treatment, such as hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis. The 
benefit-risk profile of oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy has not been demonstrated in large 
randomized, controlled studies; therefore, a comparison of burosumab treatment versus placebo over a 
24-week period was deemed appropriate and fundamental to demonstrate the benefit-risk profile of 
burosumab. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to establish the effect of burosumab treatment compared with 
placebo on increasing serum phosphorus levels in adults with XLH. 
The key secondary efficacy objectives of the study are to establish the effect of burosumab treatment 
compared with placebo on skeletal pain, stiffness, and physical functioning.

•  Change from baseline to post-baseline visits in the 6MWT percent predicted distance walked 
based on published normative data 
•  Change from Week 24 to visits after Week 24 in the TUG test completion time  
Sample size 
Determination of the sample size for this study was based on the assumption that the percentage of 
subjects who achieved mean serum phosphorus levels in the normal range at the midpoint of the dose 
interval from Baseline to Week 24 would be 60% and 10% in the burosumab and placebo groups, 
respectively. A sample size of 60 per group (total sample size of 120) provided > 95% power to detect a 
50% difference between the burosumab and placebo treatment groups in the percentages of subjects 
achieving mean serum phosphorus levels at the midpoint and end of the dose intervals between Baseline 
and Week 24 at the two-sided level of significance of 0.05. 
With a total sample size of 120 subjects, this study design also had ≥ 80% power to detect a mean 
difference of 1.0 in change from Baseline between the burosumab and placebo groups in BPI Worst Pain, 
assuming a mean change from Baseline of 2.0 in the burosumab group and 1.0 in the placebo group, a 
common standard deviation (SD) of 1.8, and a 10% drop-out rate. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects enrolled in the study were sequentially assigned an identification number. A 
randomisation schedule was developed by an independent party to maintain blinding. Subjects were 
randomised via an Interactive Web Randomization System (IWRS) and assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 
burosumab or placebo treatment groups. Randomisation was stratified by pain intensity based on the 
patient diary score for the 7 days prior to the Baseline Visit (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0). At least 4 of 7 diary days 
were required to derive the stratification for randomisation. Subjects with fewer than 4 completed diary 
days did not meet the eligibility requirement and were not to be randomised. 
Note that per protocol, stratification by pain intensity was to be based on mean BPI Worst Pain; however, 
due to an error in the IWRS, BPI Average Pain was used instead. This was discovered during the course of 
study conduct. Given that study enrolment and dosing were already ongoing at the time that the IWRS 
error was identified, it was determined that the study should continue enrolment under the implemented 
stratification factor (BPI-Q5 Average Pain) instead of changing and correcting the BPI stratification factor 
back to the protocol specified BPI-Q3 Worst Pain midway into the study. The IWRS error was recorded as 
a protocol deviation in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. 
In addition, sensitivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints were implemented to assess 
the impact of this discrepancy of the stratification factors based on BPI Worst Pain and Average Pain. 
Randomisation also was stratified by region (North America/EU, Japan, South Korea). Note that 
stratification by region was not specified in the protocol but was conducted for operational and logistic 
considerations to ensure balance between the 2 treatment groups, as small numbers of subjects were 
expected to be enrolled in Japan and South Korea.

No more than 70% female subjects were to be enrolled. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was to be conducted under double-blind conditions through Week 24 implying that neither the 
Sponsor, subject, nor site personnel involved in study conduct would know the identity of a subject’s 
treatment. Procedures implemented to achieve and maintain the double-blind status of the study included 
but was not limited to: 
•  Matched appearance of burosumab and placebo 
•  Central laboratory used for all post-baseline serum and urine parameters; site and Sponsor personnel 
were blinded to key laboratory values associated with expected changes from burosumab treatment 
during the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period 
•  Radiographs, ECHOs, renal ultrasounds, and ECGs were centrally read by individuals blinded to 
treatment assignment and subject data 
Treatment assignment for an individual subject were to be unblinded by the Investigator only in an 
emergency, e.g., event concerning subject safety, and only if knowledge of the treatment assignment is 
urgently needed for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. 
If serum phosphorus increased above 5.0 mg/dL [1.61 mmol/L] at any time or increased above the ULN 
(4.5 mg/dL [1.45 mmol/L]) on two occasions, the subject treatment assignment was to be unblinded 
(during the Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period) and the actual dose was to be decreased by half.  The 
Investigator were then to contact the medical monitor to determine when and how to further dose titrate.  
If unblinding was required for these serum phosphorus criteria, it was to be performed by the Medical 
Monitor via the “Peek Blind” function in IWRS. 
The primary analysis of the study occurred after all subjects completed their Week 24 Visit. Selected 
sponsor personnel were unblinded to treatment assignments to conduct this analysis. 
After their Week 24 Visit, all subjects received burosumab treatment. Subjects and investigators 
remained blinded to original double-blind treatment assignments until the Week 48 analysis was 
completed. 
After the Interim Database Lock on 23 March 2017, the database was unlocked and relocked twice, in 
September 2017 and in October 2017, after meetings of the Database Unlock Impact Assessment Team. 
Each unlock and relock followed the internal appropriate SOP, which describes the procedures for any 
requests for data change after an Interim Database Lock. The data changes at the site level requiring the 
unlocks were: (1) WOMAC Stiffness; (2) six-minute walk test (6MWT) baseline distance (incorrect for one 
Subject  due to a calculation error at the site); and (3) several AEs that investigators had updated or 
added after the Interim Database Lock. 
Statistical methods 
The Week 24 primary analysis was conducted after all subjects either completed the Placebo-controlled 
Treatment Period (i.e. the Week 24 Visit) or discontinued the study during that period. The Week 48 
analysis was conducted after all subjects had completed the Week 48 assessments or discontinued from 
the study during the Treatment Continuation/Extension Period to assess longer-term treatment efficacy 
and safety. The week 24 and week 48 analysis respectively were reported separately.

Analysis populations 
The primary analysis set used for the analysis of efficacy endpoints included all randomised subjects who 
received at least one dose of IP.  Subjects were analysed according to the randomised treatment group, 
regardless of the actual treatment received. 
The safety analysis set consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of IP and was 
used for the analyses of all safety endpoints. Subjects were analysed based on the actual treatment 
received. 
The Treatment Continuation Analysis Set is the subset of randomised subjects that continued after the 
24-week placebo-controlled treatment period and received at least one dose of study drug during the 
treatment continuation period. The Treatment Continuation Analysis set was used for the analysis of the 
efficacy and safety endpoints at week 48 analysis in addition to the primary analysis set and safety 
analysis set. 
The Treatment Extension Analysis Set is the subset of randomised subjects that continued after the open-
label Treatment Continuation Period and received at least one dose of study drug during the treatment 
extension period. The Treatment Extension Analysis set will be used for the analysis of the efficacy and 
safety endpoints at the Week 96 analysis in addition to the primary analysis set and safety analysis set. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to compare the 
proportion of subjects in the burosumab group and the placebo group who achieved a serum phosphorus 
level above the LLN (2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]) at 2 weeks post-dose (between Baseline and Week 24, 
on average), adjusting for the actual stratification factor used for randomisation (BPI Average Pain). In 
the case where no serum phosphorus data were available for 2 weeks post-dose between Baseline and 
Week 24, the subject was treated as a non-responder, defined as not achieving a serum phosphorus level 
above the LLN.  
Key PROs Endpoints 
The three key secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using a generalized estimation equation (GEE) 
repeated measures analysis. The GEE model included treatment, actual randomisation stratification factor 
based on BPI Average Pain (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0) if applicable, visit and interaction of treatment-by-visit as 
fixed factors with adjustment for baseline measurement. The stratification factor was not to be included in 
the GEE model for the change from baseline in BPI Worst Pain as the baseline BPI Worst Pain is highly 
correlated to the randomisation stratification factor based on BPI Average Pain. The covariance structure 
that was to be used was a compound symmetry which specifies constant variance for the assessments 
and constant covariance between the assessments over time. In general, the p-value for testing the 
statistical significance of the change from the baseline to week 24 (Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period) 
between the two treatment groups was to be provided.  Type III tests for the LS means were to be used 
for the statistical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported.   
The following sensitivity analyses were planned: 
•For BPI Worst Pain, WOMAC Stiffness and Physical Function): analyses based on the GEE model repeated 
using mBOCF, LOCF and BOCF imputation methods.  
Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data 
If no serum data was available to evaluate the primary endpoint, non-responder imputation was used, 
and hence, the subject was considered as not achieving a serum phosphorus level above the LLN. 
In the analyses of change from baseline (for example, BPI, WOMAC), only subjects with a baseline and at 
least one post-baseline measurement was included in the analysis.  
The following imputation rules were to be applied to derive the BPI and BFI endpoints at each visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 54/151 
 
 
  
  
1.If the score for the endpoint was missing at the scheduled visit, the endpoint was to be set to missing 
at this visit. 
2. Otherwise, for the endpoints of BPI pain severity dimensions, BPI severity score and BFI fatigue 
severity items derived based on the diary score, if there were more than 3 of 7 daily diary scores missing 
for the endpoint prior to the study scheduled visit, the score recorded at the scheduled visit was to be 
used for this visit. 
3. Otherwise, the average of the non-missing diary scores and the score recorded at the visit was to be 
used for this visit. 
For computing the domain scores at each visit for each subject, the WOMAC missing data algorithm was 
as follows: 
1. If two or more Pain items, both Stiffness items, or four or more Physical Functioning items are missing, 
then the corresponding scale score is set to missing. 
2. Otherwise, any missing item is replaced with the mean of the other items in its scale, and scales are 
then calculated normally. 
Sensitivity analyses for the key secondary endpoints were performed using LOCF (Last Observation 
Carried Forward), BOCF (Baseline Observation Carried Forward) and mBOCF (modified Baseline 
Observation Carried Forward) imputation method. The imputation for the mBOCF analysis was defined as 
follows: 
•For discontinuations due to AE or death, use the worst between BOCF (Baseline Observation Carried 
Forward) and LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) 
•Otherwise use LOCF.  
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
In order to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) at the 0.05 level, the following method was used for 
multiple testing with regards to the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints of PROs for the 
week 24 primary analysis. 
•Step 1: Testing the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects achieving mean serum phosphorus 
levels above the lower limit of normal at the mid-point of the dose interval, as averaged across dose 
cycles between baseline and week 24.  If the burosumab treatment group is superior to the placebo 
group (p-value < 0.05 by a two-sided test), then go to Step 2, otherwise stop testing. 
•Step 2: Testing the three key secondary endpoints of PROs (change from baseline to week 24 in BPI 
Worst Pain, WOMAC stiffness, and WOMAC physical function) between treatment groups as a group at 
0.05 level.  The Hochberg adjustment were applied for multiple testing for the three endpoints.

Flow Chart of Multiplicity Adjustment  
Hochberg Method 
Key Secondary endpoints were ranked by p-values from highest to lowest (1 to 3). 
Sensitivity analyses due to randomisation error 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints were implemented to assess the impact 
of this discrepancy of the stratification factors based on BPI Worst Pain and Average Pain (see above). To 
assess the relationship of the stratification variables based on BPI Worst Pain and BPI Average Pain, the 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient was obtained on the continuous variables of BPI Worst Pain and Average 
Pain. A contingency table between the categorical stratification factors (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0) based on BPI 
Worst Pain and Average Pain has also been provided by total and treatment groups. 
• A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using the protocol specified randomisation 
stratification factor based on BPI Worst Pain (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0) to substitute for the actual randomisation 
stratification factor based on BPI Average Pain. 
•For change from baseline to week 24 in BPI Worst Pain; an analysis adjusting for the baseline BPI 
Average Pain score instead of the baseline BPI Worst pain score in the GEE model.  
•For change from baseline to week 24 in WOMAC Stiffness and Physical Function scales; analyses were 
performed using the planned stratification factor based on the BPI Worst Pain (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0) instead of 
the actual stratification factor based on BPI Average Pain (> 6.0 or ≤ 6.0) in the GEE model. 
Week 48 analyses (the Treatment Continuation Period) 
Statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, figures, and data listings. Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, 
quartiles, minimum, and maximum will be provided. For discrete data, frequency and percent 
distributions will be provided. For time-to-event data, Kaplan-Meier estimates will be provided. For 
longitudinal analysis of endpoints measured over time, GEE analysis will be used.

Results UX023-CL303 
Participant flow 
A total of 163 subjects were screened for this study, of whom 134 subjects were enrolled and randomized 
1:1 to burosumab (68 subjects) or placebo (66 subjects). Subject disposition is shown in Table 19.  
Table 17: Subject Disposition (All Randomized Subjects) 
The most common reason for screen failure (reported for 10 subjects) was failure to meet the inclusion 
criterion requiring presence of skeletal pain attributed to XLH/osteomalacia, as defined by a score of ≥ 4 
on BPI Worst Pain at SV1. The next most common reason (5 subjects) was meeting the exclusion 
criterion of having serum iPTH ≥ 2.5 x ULN at SV1.  
All but one subject, who was in the burosumab group, completed the 24-week Placebo-controlled 
Treatment Period. The subject who discontinued withdrew consent for participation in the study after 
approximately 6 months of treatment (last dose of burosumab administered approximately 1 month 
before study withdrawal) and did not complete the Week 24 Visit assessments. 
Per the protocol, the planned randomisation stratification was BPI pain intensity based on the mean of the 
7 days of BPI Worst Pain diary scores prior to baseline visit. Due to an error in the IWR, the actual 
randomisation stratification was based on the mean of the BPI Average Pain scores prior to baseline.  
As shown in Table 20, for approximately 60% of subjects, their actual BPI Average Pain randomisation 
stratification category and their planned BPI Worst Pain randomisation stratification categories were the 
same (e.g., if their planned stratification category was ≤6.0, their actual stratification category also was 
≤ 6.0).  
The Pearson correlation coefficient between these categories was 0.82256 (p < 0.0001), showing that 
these categories were highly associated and indicating that with regard to randomisation of individual 
subjects, the impact of the stratification misclassification was likely minimal.

Table 18: Randomization Stratification Categories (Primary Analysis Set) UX023-CL303 
a Per the protocol, the planned randomization stratification was BPI pain intensity based on the mean of the 7 days of BPI Worst Pain diary scores 
prior to baseline visit. The actual randomization stratification was based on the mean of the BPI Average Pain scores prior to baseline. The baseline 
BPI Worst Pain and BPI Average Pain are defined as the mean of the BPI Worst Pain and BPI Average Pain for 8 days including the 
7 days of diary scores prior to baseline visit and the baseline visit score, respectively. 
Recruitment 
This study is being conducted at 25 study centres, including 8 in the US, 5 each in the United Kingdom 
and Japan, 3 in France, 2 in South Korea, and 1 each in Ireland and Italy. 
The study started October 22, 2015 (Date first subject signed informed consent). Data cut-off date for 
the current application was June 08, 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Protocol UX023-CL303 (dated 05 June 2015) was modified by three amendments:  
Amendment 1 (dated 21 July 2016) 
The main purpose of Amendment 1 was to incorporate feedback from regulatory authorities, modify or 
clarify certain procedures, correct inconsistencies, and remove redundant wording. 
Key elements: 
•  A 48-week Extension Period was added to the study design. 
• 
Enthesopathy was added as an efficacy measure in the study. The TUG test was added as an 
exploratory endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 58/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
•  A provision was added to allow additional testing for mutations consistent with syndromes with 
overlapping clinical and biochemical characteristics as XLH if the initial PHEX mutation analysis 
was negative or inconclusive and informed consent was provided by the subject. 
Amendment 2 (dated 08 September 2016) 
The main purpose of Amendment 2 was to clarify language and procedures and correct inconsistencies. 
Amendment 3 (dated 31 Mar 2017) 
The main purpose of Amendment 3 was to modify the categorization of the secondary efficacy objectives 
of the study (i.e., as “key” and “other”) and corresponding secondary endpoints, to update the 
exploratory endpoints, and to update the planned statistical analyses. In addition, randomisation 
stratification was clarified, contraception requirements were updated, Safety Follow-up telephone calls 
(TCs) were added, the treatment duration was extended for study sites in the United States (US), subject 
or caregiver administration of study drug in the home setting in the US was added, and the Coordinating 
Investigator designated for this study was added. Minor edits and typographical corrections have also 
been made. 
Key elements: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 24 in the WOMAC Stiffness score and Change from baseline to 
Week 24 in the WOMAC Physical Function score were identified as key secondary efficacy 
endpoints in addition to Change from baseline to Week 24 in BPI-Q3 (Worst Pain) score. 
•  Randomization stratification was updated to clarify that randomization was stratified not only by 
baseline pain intensity, but also by region (North America/European Union, Japan, and South 
Korea). 
•  A second Treatment Extension Period that included up to approximately 53 additional weeks of 
burosumab treatment was added for subjects enrolled at sites in the US only. In addition, Safety 
Follow-up telephone calls (TCs) over an interval of up to 8 weeks following the End of Study or 
Early Termination Visit were added. The maximum study duration consequently was changed to 
up to approximately 157 weeks. For subjects outside of the US, the duration of study treatment 
remained 96 weeks, followed by Safety Follow-up TCs over an interval of up to 8 weeks. 
Protocol deviations 
As of the data cut-off date for this report, 71 subjects (41 burosumab, 30 placebo) had major protocol 
deviations (Table 21).  
Table 19: Major Protocol Deviations (All Randomized Subjects) 
Most major deviations involved procedures not done (21.6%; e.g., required fasting before laboratory 
assessments was not of full duration or fasting status was not recorded, corrected calcium for eligibility 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

was verified at SV1 instead of SV2), other (20.1%; e.g., required fasting time was not recorded or fasting 
was not of full duration, ECHO performed by a cardiologist not declared on the delegation log), or 
informed consent (16.4%; e.g., re-consent not performed in a timely manner). 
Exposure  
In both treatment groups, the median weight-based dose of study drug was 1.0 mg/kg (mean: 0.99 
mg/kg; range: 0.6 – 1.1) at the Baseline Visit and remained between 0.9 and 1.0 mg/kg (mean: 0.87-
0.98 mg/kg; range: 0.2 – 1.2) at all post-Baseline visits. 
The protocol included criteria for treatment assignment unblinding and dose adjustments due to elevated 
serum phosphorus levels over upper level of normal (ULN) (>4.5 mg/dL [1.45 mmol/L]). Most subjects 
did not require dose adjustments. During the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period, 5 (7.4%) subjects in 
the burosumab group and no subject in the placebo group had treatment unblinded per protocol. Across 
all treatment periods, the dose of burosumab was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg in 11 (8.2%) subjects and 
subsequently maintained at that dose in 10 of the 11 subjects.

Prior conventional therapy 
Table 22: Prior Conventional Therapy 
Prior medical history 
Conditions noted most commonly in subjects’ medical history (> 30% of subjects) were in the SOCs of 
surgical and medical procedures (56.7%); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (40.3%); and 
nervous system disorders (31.3%). Events most commonly reported in subjects’ medical history (> 15% 
of subjects) were hypertension (25.4%), osteotomy (17.9%), and seasonal allergy (15.7%). 
The conditions were generally well balanced between the treatment arms. Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders were more common in subjects randomised to burosumab (44% vs 36%), as were 
General disorders and administration site conditions (mainly pain, fatigue and pyrexia) (21% vs 14%) 
and Ear and labyrinth disorders (21% vs 9%) whereas Vascular disorders (mainly hypertension) was 
more common in subjects randomised to placebo (32% vs 25%).

No PHEX mutation was identified for seven (5%) subjects, including six in the burosumab group and one 
in the placebo group. The seven subjects, for whom mutations in the PHEX gene were not identified, were 
clinically diagnosed with XLH and met the inclusion criterion for support of the diagnosis of XLH. Four of 
the subjects (all in the burosumab group) had directly related family members with an inheritance pattern 
consistent with X-linked disease.  
Numbers analysed 
All 134 randomized subjects (100.0%) received at least one dose of study drug in the Placebo-controlled 
Treatment Period and were included in the Primary and Safety Analysis Sets.  
All 134 of the subjects in the Safety Analysis Set had at least one evaluable PK concentration and were 
included in the PK Analysis Set.

Outcomes and estimation 
Model-based estimates for WOMAC Stiffness, 6MWT, and fractures were reanalysed for the Placebo-
controlled Treatment Period because additional or corrected data were provided for these endpoints after 
the Interim Database Lock for the primary analysis. Efficacy analyses for the Week 24 CSR were used for 
other model-based estimates in the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period. The Week 48 analysis was used 
for all other efficacy data, including mean/SD at every visit, and LS mean (SE) at visits after Week 24. 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of subjects achieving mean serum phosphorus 
levels above the lower level of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L])) at the midpoint of the dose 
interval (i.e., 2 weeks after each dose of study drug, the time of peak PD effect), as averaged across dose 
cycles between Baseline and Week 24. 
Table 25: Primary Endpoint - Primary Analysis (CMH Test Adjusting for Region and Actual Randomization 
Stratification Based on BPI Average Pain) (Primary Analysis Set) 
The 95% CIs for the proportion of subjects who achieve mean serum phosphorus levels above the LLN are calculated using the Wilson score method. 
The p-value is from Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) testing for association between achieving mean serum phosphorus levels above the LLN and 
treatment group, adjusting for the actual randomization stratification of BPI Average Pain and region. 
Primary Endpoint -- Sensitivity Analysis 
A prespecified sensitivity analysis adjusting for region and for the planned randomization stratification 
based on BPI Worst Pain produced results similar to those of the primary analysis (p < 0.0001). This 
indicates that the randomization stratification misclassification had minimal impact on the results for the 
primary endpoint. 
Primary Endpoint -- Subgroup Analyses 
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint by baseline BPI Worst Pain (≤6.0, > 6.0), actual 
randomization stratification factor based on BPI Average Pain (≤6.0, > 6.0), and geographic region 
(North America/EU, Japan, South Korea) were performed using the Fisher’s Exact test to compare 
between the treatment groups.  
The baseline demographics were not fully balanced between the subgroups. The >6.0 subgroup had a 
greater percentage of females (67%) and also had a greater percentage of subjects from North 
America/EU (90%) than the ≤6.0 subgroup (55% and 79%, respectively). The >6.0 subgroup had a 
smaller percentage of Asian subjects (13%) than the ≤6.0 subgroup (24%). In addition, the >6.0 
subgroup had a greater percentage of subjects who received conventional therapy with both phosphate 
and vitamin D metabolites or analogues after the age of 18 years (75%) than the ≤6.0 subgroup (63%). 
Results of the analyses for the BPI Worst Pain and Average Pain subgroups were similar to those of the 
primary analysis for the overall population, demonstrating that in each of the subgroups, a statistically 
significantly greater percentage of subjects in the KRN23 group (ranging from 93% to 100% across the 
four subgroups) achieved a serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across the midpoints of the 
dose intervals through Week 24 compared with the placebo group (ranging from 5% to 13% across the 
subgroups) (p < 0.0001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 64/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
In analyses of the subgroups based on region, results for the North America/EU and Japan subgroups 
were similar to those of the analysis of the overall population. In each of these subgroups, a statistically 
significantly greater percentage of subjects in the KRN23 group (97% in North America/EU, 100% in 
Japan) achieved a serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across the midpoints of the dose 
intervals through Week 24 than in the placebo group (9% in North America/EU, 0% in Japan) 
(p ≤0.0022).  
For the subgroup of subjects from South Korea, which included only four subjects in the KRN23 group and 
three subjects in the placebo group, a significant difference between treatment groups was not observed. 
Two (50%) of the subjects in the KRN23 group achieved a serum phosphorus concentration above the 
LLN across the midpoints of the dose intervals through Week 24, compared with no subjects in the 
placebo group. 
Results of additional subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint by sex and race (white, non-white) also 
were similar to those of the analysis for the overall population, demonstrating that in each of the 
subgroups, a notably greater percentage of subjects in the KRN23 group (ranging from 85% to 96% 
across the subgroups) achieved a serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across the midpoints of 
the dose intervals through Week 24 than in the placebo group (ranging from 0% to 9% across the 
subgroups). 
Seven subjects, six in the KRN23 group and one in the placebo group, did not have identified PHEX 
mutations at baseline but were clinically diagnosed with XLH and met the inclusion criterion for support of 
the diagnosis of XLH with FGF23 serum concentrations at baseline >30 pg/mL. All six of the subjects in 
the KRN23 group achieved a serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across the midpoints of the 
dose intervals through Week 24; each also had a serum phosphorus concentration within the normal 
range at Week 24. Serum phosphorus levels in the subject in the placebo group remained below the LLN 
through Week 24. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Per the Hochberg multiplicity adjustment specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan, because the result of 
the primary endpoint primary analysis was statistically significant, the key secondary endpoints of 
changes from baseline to Week 24 in BPI Worst Pain, WOMAC Stiffness, and WOMAC Physical Function 
scores were tested between the treatment groups at the 0.05 significance level. The three endpoints were 
analysed using generalised estimation equation repeated measure analysis and tested as a group with 
Hochberg multiplicity adjustment, in which the nominal p-values for the endpoints were ordered from the 
largest to the smallest to determine the significance level at which they were tested (Table 28).  
Data is presented graphically in Figure 17, Figure 18 and Figure 19.

Other Secondary endpoints: Serum phosphate 
In the burosumab group 67.6% achieved a mean serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across 
the ends (time of trough PD effect) of the dose intervals through Week 24 compared to 6.1%. 
Results of secondary analyses assessing additional changes in serum phosphorus at both the midpoints 
(time of peak PD effect) of the dose cycles is shown in Figure 20. All subjects received burosumab 
beginning at the Week 24 visit; however, they remained blinded to their previous treatment assignment.

Other Secondary Endpoints Assessing PROs 
The PROs included in the Secondary endpoints (Change from Baseline to post-Baseline visits) were BPI 
Worst Pain, BPI Pain severity, BPI Pain interference, BFI Worst Fatigue, BFI Global Fatigue, WOMAC 
Stiffness, and WOMAC Physical Function. 
At Week 24, the BPI Pain Severity score in the burosumab had decreased from 5.2 at baseline to 4.4 at 
Week 24. The corresponding numbers for placebo was 4.9 to 4.6. The LS mean difference between the 
treatment arms was -0.4 [0.25] (p = 0.093).  
At week 24, the BPI Pain Interference in the burosumab had decreased from 5.2 at baseline to 4.4 at 
Week 24. The corresponding numbers for placebo was 4.7 to 4.2. The LS mean difference between the 
treatment arms was -0.13 [0.29] (p = 0.65). 
At week 24, the BFI Worst Fatigue, in the burosumab had decreased from 6.9 at baseline to 6.0 at Week 
24. The corresponding numbers for placebo was 6.7 to 6.1. The LS mean difference between the 
treatment arms was -0.20 [0.31] (p = 0.52). 
At week 24, the BFI Global Fatigue, in the burosumab had decreased from 5.3 at baseline to 4.7 at Week 
24. The corresponding numbers for placebo was 4.8 to 4.2. The LS mean difference between the 
treatment arms was +0.11 [0.29] (p = 0.71).  
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints – Pharmacodynamic Measures 
Serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations increased after initiation of burosumab treatment, which was an 
expected PD effect (Figure 21).  
Figure 20: Mean (± SE) Serum 1,25(OH)2D Concentrations (pg/mL) over Time in Study UX023-CL303 
The horizontal line represents the upper limit of normal. 
The LS mean (SE) difference between treatment groups in the change from Baseline to Week 22 (22.7 
[2.40] pg/mL) was significant (p < 0.0001), as was the difference in percentage change (81.6% 
[11.67%]) (p < 0.0001). 
The feedback regulation of serum 1,25(OH)2D levels over time has been observed in all burosumab 
studies and likely represents normal feedback regulation as phosphate-calcium homeostasis improves 
with burosumab therapy.

At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 24 was 0.56 (0.110) mg/dL in the 
burosumab group and 0.13 (0.090) mg/dL in the placebo group (LS mean [SE] difference 0.43 [0.067] 
mg/dL; p < 0.0001). 
Increases in TmP/GFR due to burosumab were accompanied by increases in tubular reabsorption of 
phosphate (TRP). The mean (SD) TRP at Baseline was 0.81 (0.083) for the burosumab group and 0.81 
(0.084) for the placebo group. At Week 24, mean (SD) was 0.84 (0.065) for the burosumab group and 
0.80 (0.106) for the placebo group (LS mean [SE] difference in the change from Baseline 0.04 [0.013]; p 
= 0.0008). 
Bone biomarkers in serum reflect the rate of bone remodelling. With osteomalacia, a hallmark of XLH 
(Glorieux et al. 1980), (Sullivan et al. 1992), the poorly mineralized bone prevents osteoclasts from 
attaching to the bone surface to initiate the bone remodelling process. Therefore, patients with XLH have 
a low bone remodelling rate that impairs bone quality, leading to pseudofractures and delayed fracture 
healing. 
P1NP and CTx are markers of bone formation and bone resorption, respectively. ALP and BALP are 
important markers in XLH-related bone disease in the paediatric population but are less indicative of bone 
disease in the adult population. In addition, ALP and BALP are less sensitive to changes in bone 
remodelling than P1NP and CTx 
The effect of burosumab on P1NP, and CTx are summarised in Figure 23 and Figure 24,respectively.

Figure 23: Mean (± SE) Serum CTx (pg/mL) Concentration Over Time in Study UX023-CL303 
The mean (SD) P1NP concentration at Baseline was 85 (50.7) ng/mL in the burosumab group and 88 
(53.3) ng/mL in the placebo group. At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) differences between treatment groups 
for the change from Baseline (62 [7.5] ng/mL) and for the percentage change from Baseline (65.5% 
[8.1%]) were both statistically significant (p < 0.0001 for each). 
The mean (SD) CTx concentration at Baseline was 702 (395.5) pg/mL in the burosumab group and 721 
(417.9) pg/mL in the placebo group At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) differences between treatment groups 
for the change from Baseline (190 [41.2] pg/mL) and for the percentage change from Baseline (27.5% 
[7.4%]) were both statistically significant (p ≤0.0002). 
For BALP, no statistically significant difference in change from baseline between the treatment arms was 
reported (LS mean [SE increase] 41.2% [11.4%] vs 31.1% [10.9%]; p = 0.4574). 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints: Pseudofracture and Fracture Healing as Defined by Skeletal Survey 
The MAH contracted a third party to provide an independent review of site-acquired x-ray data. One 
independent reviewer was to review the baseline skeletal survey x-rays and indicate if there are active or 
non-active bone fractures and pseudo-fractures and their locations. Two different independent reviewers 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 70/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
assessed the targeted x-ray time point images, comparing the current time point image with the image 
from the baseline time point or the time point the fracture was initially identified.  
However ,during analysis of the radiograph data for this study, it was discovered that at least 1 of the 2 
trained central readers did not consistently use the Baseline radiograph as the comparator for grading 
purposes as intended and instead used the most recent radiograph as the comparator (e.g., the Week 12 
radiograph was used as the comparator to determine Week 24 fracture/pseudofracture healing grading). 
In this context, the Week 12 fracture/pseudofracture grading results are valid because Baseline was the 
only possible comparator. Also, because a healed grade (reflecting complete healing) has a strict 
definition that is independent of comparator and not subject to bias, the numbers of 
fractures/pseudofractures reported as healed at Week 24 are valid and reliable; however, 
fractures/pseudofractures reported to be partially healed, unchanged, or worse at Week 24 may not be 
accurate in some cases given the inconsistent use of the Baseline X-ray as a comparator.  
Analyses described in the primary report, therefore, focused primarily on: (1) the percentages of Baseline 
active fractures and pseudofractures that are healed (completely) at Weeks 12 and 24 and (2) ad hoc 
estimation of an odds ratio for active fracture and pseudofracture healing based on a generalized linear 
mixed proportional odds model for binary responses While both of these approaches are valid in this 
context, Week 24 radiographs were also re-read after a central reader re-training to confirm the results of 
the Week 24 analyses. The results of the re-read are provided in this report. As the imaging vendor 
platform required readers to simultaneously enter fracture grades and calcaneal enthesopathy 
measurements, the Week 24 calcaneal enthesopathy measurements were re-read as well. The goal of the 
re-read was to provide a full and accurate fracture healing dataset. Readers and imaging vendor 
personnel remained blinded to double-blind treatment assignment of the subjects. Readers did not have 
access to their previous Week 24 grading scores. 
At baseline, 32 (47%) subjects in the burosumab group had a total of 14 active fractures and 51 active 
pseudofractures; 38 (58%) subjects in the placebo group had at total of 13 active fractures and 78 active 
pseudofractures.  
The percentage of Baseline active fractures/pseudofractures for each grade (re-read) is summarised in 
Table 30.

A post hoc analysis using a hierarchical generalised linear mixed proportional odds model was performed 
separately at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 to estimate the probabilities of fracture grade occurrence and 
odds ratios for healed fractures and their 95% CIs (Table 31).

Probabilities of each fracture grade occurrence, odds ratios at each visit, and their confidence intervals are estimated using a generalised linear mixed 
model for binomial distribution that includes treatment, visit, treatment by visit, and fracture type as fixed factors, accounting for nesting of fractures 
within subjects. 
CI = confidence interval. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints: Enthesopathy Burden as Defined by Skeletal Survey 
Mineralization of tendons/ligaments (enthesopathy) is a feature of XLH that can contribute to stiffness. 
Total calcaneal enthesopathy burden was assessed as the sum of dimensions of superior and inferior 
calcaneal spurs bilaterally measured in 2 dimensions; measured by lateral foot X-rays. Because this 
assessment was added in Protocol Amendment 1, approximately 9 months after enrolment of the first 
subject, few subjects completed this assessment at both Baseline and at Week 24 (12 burosumab, 10 
placebo). Greater numbers of subjects completed this assessment at both Baseline and Week 48 (52 
burosumab, 45 placebo). 
Enthesopathy was present in nearly all subjects (99.3%) at baseline (Table 32).

At Week 48, the LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 48 was -0.53 (0.208) cm in the 
burosumab→burosumab group and -0.12 (0.224) cm in the placebo→burosumab group. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints: Mobility by 6MWT 
At Baseline, the mean (SD) actual distance walked was 356.8 (109.46) m (range: 55 – 643 m) in the 
burosumab group and 367.4 (103.41) m (160 – 615 m) in the placebo group.  
Change from baseline in distance walked in 6MWT (m) is shown in Figure 25. At Week 24, the LS mean 
(SE) change from Baseline was 14.8 (7.67) m in the burosumab group and -5.0 (7.54) m in the placebo 
group; the LS mean difference between treatment groups was 19.8 (7.67) m (p = 0.0108). 
The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 48 was 30.5 (6.93) m in the burosumab→burosumab

Exploratory endpoint: Timed up and go test (TUG) 
TUG was added in Protocol Amendment 1, approximately 9 months after enrolment of the first subject No 
baseline values are recorded and only a small subset of subjects has records from Week 24 (4 
burosumab, 5 placebo). At Week 48, TUG was recorded in 32 subjects in each treatment arm. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints: Patient Global Impression of Improvement 
The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-
I) instruments were administered to assess subject perception of disease severity at baseline and 
improvement with treatment over time, respectively.  
The mean (SD) PGI-S score at Baseline on a scale of 1 (normal) to 4 (severe) was 3.2 (0.62) in the 
burosumab group and 3.0 (0.82) in the placebo group. 
At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) PGI-I score on a scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse) 
was 3.6 (0.16) in the burosumab group and 3.9 (0.17) in the placebo group (LS mean [SE] difference -
0.3 [0.23]; p = 0.2035).

Study Title 
A Phase 2b, Open-Label, Long-Term Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacodynamics of 
KRN23 in Adult Subjects with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
Study Design 
This ongoing, open-label extension study enrolled adults with XLH who previously participated in Study 
KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23-INT-002 to collect additional information on the safety, PD response, 
Assessment report

immunogenicity, Patient reported outcomes (PROs), and mobility with long-term SC administration of 
burosumab in this subject population.  
Subjects who were discontinued from Study KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23-INT-002 due to a treatment-
emergent adverse event classified as possibly or probably related to treatment could be eligible for 
participation in this study based on the clinical judgment of the investigator with agreement from the 
applicant. The planned study duration is 194 weeks. 
Treatments 
All subjects received open-label KRN23 (0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks) that matched their last 
dose in study KRN23-INT-001 or KRN23-INT-002 and were based on subjects’ body weight at Day 0. 
Up to Week 12, if the subject had not reached serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal 
(LLN; 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]) at the end of the dose interval, the investigator could titrate the dose 
upward every 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg based on fasting trough serum phosphorus 
levels. Doses could be titrated downward if at any point the serum phosphorus level increased above the 
upper limit of normal (ULN; 4.5 mg/dL [1.45 mmol/L]). 
Endpoints 
The primary PD endpoints were: 
•  Number and percentage of subjects who had serum phosphorus levels in the normal range (2.5–
4.5 mg/dL [0.81–1.45 mmol/L]) or outside the normal range. 
•  Change from Baseline in serum biochemistry parameters associated with XLH, as measured by 
serum phosphorus, iPTH, FGF23 (total and free), and 1,25(OH)2D.  
•  Change from Baseline in urinalysis parameters associated with XLH, as measured by 2-hour urine 
(ie, TmP/GFR, TRP, calcium, creatinine, phosphorus) and by 24-hour urine (ie, urinary phosphate, 
calcium, creatinine, urine calcium/creatinine ratio).  
•  Change from Baseline in bone biomarkers, as measured by total ALP and BALP, CTx, and P1NP.  
The exploratory efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Change from Baseline in pain, stiffness, physical and mental functioning, and HRQoL as measured 
by changes in the WOMAC, BPI-SF, and SF-36v2 scores.  
•  Healing of prior or existing fractures or other disease-related skeletal abnormalities as viewed on 
standard radiographs.  
•  Change from Baseline in walking ability as measured by change in the distance walked on the 
6MWT in meters and percent predicted normal values.  
•  Change from Baseline in transitions during ambulatory activity that incorporates strength, agility, 
and dynamic balance as measured by the time required to complete the Timed Up And Go (TUG) 
test. 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
All 20 (100.0%) enrolled subjects completed 48 weeks of burosumab administration. For further details, 
please refer to Table 16 
Six (30%) subjects were male and 14 (70%) were female. The mean age was 49.8 years.  
 Notable findings on reported XLH medical history included short stature (95.0% of subjects), bowing of 
lower legs (95.0%), unusual gait (85.0%), dental abscess (85.0%), osteoarthritis (75.0%), enthesopathy

(60.0%), and nephrocalcinosis (20.0%). All subjects had joint stiffness/limited range of motion. Most 
subjects (85%) received prior phosphate or vitamin D treatment. 
Exposure 
At the Week 48 analysis cut-off date, subjects had received a median of 16.5 doses of burosumab (range, 
13 [Week 48 dose] to 18 [Week 68 dose]).  
The median weight-based dose was 0.80 mg/kg at the Baseline visit and either 0.60 or 0.80 mg/kg at all 
post-Baseline visits through Week 48 of KRN23 treatment. Between Baseline and Week 48 of KRN23 
treatment, 15 of 20 subjects received a stable dose throughout the study with most of these subjects 
receiving doses of 0.6 mg/kg (4/20 [20%]) or 1.0 mg/kg (9/20 [45%]). Three subjects who initiated 
treatment at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg increased their dose to 0.6 mg/kg at Week 4; one subject who initiated 
treatment at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg had a dose decrease to 0.3 mg/kg due to elevated serum phosphorus, 
and one subject who received a starting dose of 1.0 mg/kg had a dose reduction to 0.6 mg/kg followed 
by a return to the starting dose level at Week 24. 
Results  
Pharmacodynamics  
The mean serum phosphorus concentration at baseline was below the normal range, as expected for 
subjects with XLH. Results from the pharmacodynamic parameters are summarised in Figure 26, Figure 
27 and Figure 28.

SE = standard error. Note: n = 16 at Week 24 because the laboratory cancelled four samples due to insufficient centrifugation. Dotted lines denote the 
range of normal for serum phosphorus, corresponding to 0.81-1.45 mmol/L. 
All 20 (100.0%) subjects had at least one serum phosphorus level in the normal range during burosumab 
dosing, including 85.0% to 100.0% of subjects at each midpoint visit 2 weeks after a dose (the time of 
peak PD effect), and 45.0% to 73.7% of subjects at trough visits just prior to the next dose, as expected 
from the monthly dosing regimen. LS mean change from baseline to Week 48 in serum phosphorus was 
0.68 mg/dL [0.22 mmol/L] (p<0.0001).

None of the mental health domain scores of the SF-36v2 changed significantly from Baseline to Week 48 
of KRN23 treatment.  
Radiographic Endpoints 
According to the MAH, analyses of postbaseline radiographic assessments will be provided separately in 
the final study report.  
Mobility tests 
The mean actual distance walked on the 6MWT increased from 322.4 m (range, 80.0–639.0 m) at 
Baseline to 352.0 m (range, 160.0–589.0 m) at Week 48 (LS mean change, 29.6 m; SE, 15.2; p = 
0.0511).  
Mean values for the “timed up and go test” (TUG) test decreased significantly from 12.8 sec (range, 6.2–
24.9) at Baseline to 10.4 sec (range, 5.6–16.9) at Week 48 (LS mean change, -2.6 sec; SE, 0.6 sec p < 
0.0001). 
 LS Mean change from Baseline in 6MWT is shown in Figure 30 and in TUG in Figure 31.

Study Title  
An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Effects of KRN23 on Osteomalacia in Adults 
with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
Study Design 
This ongoing, open-label, uncontrolled Phase 3 study was designed to establish the effects of burosumab 
on bone quality and osteomalacia associated with XLH.  
The study enrolled adult subjects with a diagnosis of XLH supported by typical clinical and biochemical 
features and who had not received oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy in the 2 years prior to 
enrolment.

Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 14 adult subjects have been enrolled into the study. As of the data cut-off date for the Week 48 
analysis (30 Aug 2017), 13 subjects remained in the study and had completed the 48-week Open-label 
Treatment Period. One subject withdrew consent and discontinued from the study after 12 burosumab 
doses prior to the Week 48 visit. 
Evaluable biopsies were available at baseline and Week 48 for 11 subjects. The remaining 3 baseline 
biopsies were obtained but not suitable for histomorphometric analysis due to sample bone 
fragmentation, inadequate fixation, and/or poor labelling quality. 
The mean age at enrolment was 40.1 years. Most subjects were female (57%), and most were white 
(64%). Mean (SD) serum phosphorus at baseline was 2.24 (0.396) mg/dL, below the normal range for 
adults (2.5-4.5 mg/dL). For further details, please refer to Table 16. 
Exposure 
As of the 30 Aug 2017 cut-off date, subjects had a median exposure of burosumab Q4W of 51.8 weeks 
(range, 43.9 to 75.7 weeks). The subject who withdrew consent received 12 doses of burosumab (last 
dose at Week 44) before withdrawal from the study. 
Results 
Histomorphometric Analyses (Primary and Secondary Endpoints) 
The MAH has provided reference ranges for bone parameters healthy postmenopausal women (Recker et 
al. 1988): 
•  Osteoid volume as a percentage of total bone volume (OV/BV): 0.3% to 3.1%.  
•  Osteoid thickness (O.Th): 5.5-12 μm).  
•  Osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS): 7% to 25% 
Due to mineralization defects, mineralization lag time (MLt) was not directly measurable at Baseline for 5 
of the 11 subjects (45.5%) but was measurable in all but one Week 48 biopsy (10/11, 90.9%). 
The results on the primary endpoint ((OV/BV) and the secondary histomorphometric endpoints are 
summarised in

The percent change from baseline was statistically significant with p<0.0001 for OV/BV and O.Th and 
p=0.0002 for OS/BS. 
Bone biopsies were also qualitatively analysed to assess the presence of osteomalacia. At Baseline, all 
subjects had osteomalacia as determined by evaluation of the iliac crest bone biopsy; nearly half of the 
subjects in the Primary Analysis Set (5/11, 45%) presented with severe osteomalacia. After 48 weeks of 
burosumab treatment, subsequent bone biopsy revealed severe osteomalacia in only 1 subject (9%), with 
mild osteomalacia in the remaining 10 subjects 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Proportion of Subjects Achieving Mean Serum Phosphorus 
Concentrations above the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) 
The key secondary endpoint of the study evaluated the proportion of subjects achieving mean serum 
phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]) at the mid-point of 
the dose interval (i.e., Weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22), as averaged across dose cycles between baseline and 
Week 24.  
A total of 92.9% of subjects (13 of 14 subjects) achieved a mean serum phosphorus concentration above 
the LLN across the midpoints of dose intervals through Week 24 (95% CI: 68.5, 98.7; p-value < 0.0001)

Secondary endpoint: Changes from Baseline in MAR, MS/BS, BFR 
Tetracycline irreversibly binds to hydroxyapatite at the mineralization front to allow for visualization and 
quantification of bone formation (Kulak et al. 2010). 
Mineralization surface (MS/BS) represents the proportion of the bone surface that is active in 
mineralization at a specific time. At Baseline, mean (SD) MS/BS was 6.0% (4.76%). At Week 48, MS/BS 
trended towards increased mineralization, with a mean (SD) MS/BS 7.0% (3.65%), a mean (SD) change 
from Baseline of 1.3% (4.37%).  
The mineral apposition rate (MAR), defined as the ratio of distance between two consecutive labels and 
time between the labelling midpoints (Dempster et al. 2013), was used to measure the rate of new bone 
deposition. At Baseline, mean (SD) MAR was 0.58 (0.448) μm/day. At Week 48, there was no meaningful 
change in MAR, with a mean (SD) of 0.62 (0.188) μm/day, a mean (SD) change from Baseline of 0.04 
(0.506) μm/day.  
The MAR is also used to derive the bone formation rate (BFR). After 48 weeks of burosumab treatment, 
there was no meaningful change in BFR/BS ratio, from a mean (SD) of 26.68 (19.480) μm3/μm2/year at 
Baseline to 17.17 (12.058) μm3/μm2/year at Week 48, a mean (SD) change from Baseline of -4.90 
(27.356) μm3/μm2/year. 
Exploratory Endpoint: Fracture healing 
The baseline skeletal survey was read by a central radiologist who identified non-active (healed) fractures 
in 6 subjects (42.9%) and non-active pseudofractures in 5 subjects (35.7%). Although there were no 
active (unhealed) fractures reported for any subjects (0.0%), active pseudofractures were present in 4 
subjects (28.6%). None of the active pseudofractures were worsened or unchanged following burosumab 
treatment, and there were no new findings (Table 35).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of burosumab in adults with XLH was evaluated in two ongoing Phase 3 studies (UX023-
CL303 and UX023-CL304), two Phase 1/2 adult studies (KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002), and one 
long-term Phase 2b extension to the Phase 1/2 studies, Study UX023-CL203, for which a Week 48 
analysis has been completed.  
UX023-CL303 is the largest of the five studies and the only double-blind, controlled study in the adult 
clinical development program, and thus considered to be the main study.  
Posology 
The recommended posology for both adults and children is weight-based. For children, the approved 
starting dose is 0.4 mg/kg every second week (Q2W), the proposed maintenance dose 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
and the maximal recommended weight-based dose is 2 mg/kg Q2W up to a total of 90 mg per 
administration.  
The proposed starting dose in adolescents (0.8 mg/kg Q2W) is entirely based on PK/PD simulations.  
In the proposed adult posology, the recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg Q4W with a possibility to 
increase the dose up to a maximum of 90 mg per administration. This dosing was based on PK/PD-
modelling and dose escalation in studies KRN23-INT-001/KRN23-INT-002. The same dose was used in 
studies UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304. The mean administered dose in those studies ranged from 0.87 
to 0.98 mg/kg. 
Simulations from the PK/PD model showed that burosumab exposure estimates are greater following 
burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W dosing than burosumab 1.0 mg/kg Q4W and differences in PK translates to 
relatively smaller changes from baseline of serum phosphorus due to saturation of the PK/PD mechanism. 
For the clinical endpoint of serum phosphorus levels, the predicted levels at Cmin, Cavg, and Cmax are all 
similar between the regimens. It should be noted that at all exposure measures, the 95th percentile of 
serum phosphorus predictions are greater following 0.8 mg/kg Q2W than those for burosumab 1.0 mg/kg 
Q4W. Given that events of hyperphosphataemia occurred following burosumab 1.0 mg/kg Q4W 
administration to adults in Study UX023-CL303, burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W administration in adults may 
put this population at an increased risk for hyperphosphataemia. This potential for an increased risk of 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

hyperphosphataemia following burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W suggests that this lower dose level, 
administered more frequently, would not be desirable to use in the adult population. 
Study design UX023-CL303 
The 24-week randomised, double-blind, controlled design of the treatment period in the main study 
UX023-CL303 is considered adequate, as is the open-label extension period. However, the choice of 
comparator (i.e., placebo) is acceptable as the practical feasibility of the alternative (conventional XLH 
treatment with oral phosphate and active vitamin-D analogues) could be questioned. Nevertheless, this 
implies that it is not possible in the current study to draw any conclusions on burosumab efficacy 
compared to conventional phosphate/D-vitamin treatment. 
The key eligibility criteria for study UX023-CL303 are considered to reflect the intended target population 
and are therefore accepted.  
The primary efficacy measure in study UX023-CL303 was the change in serum phosphorus levels.  
The change in serum phosphorus level could be considered a valid pharmacodynamic surrogate marker 
for the target molecule, FGF23. As such it is accepted. The relevance of increased serum phosphorus for 
clinical improvement is further discussed below.  
The study includes several secondary and exploratory endpoints based on Patient reported outcome 
(PRO), including the key secondary endpoints. It is agreed that reports on the subjects’ subjective 
perception of their symptoms are of high clinical relevance, however, such data needs to be interpreted 
with caution, especially in the open-label setting, where they are not considered reliable. Upon request, 
the MAH has justified the choice of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Worst pain and the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) stiffness and physical function domains as tools to 
evaluate the key secondary endpoints. 
A sample size of 60 subjects per group was planned and since XLH is a rare condition, this sample size is 
reasonable. The sample size seems to have been based on the only key secondary endpoint that was 
identified originally, i.e. BPI Worst Pain. Later, when the study was already ongoing and the recruitment 
was probably completed, two additional key secondary endpoints were identified (see below under “Study 
conduct”). Nothing has been found regarding expected treatment difference or expected power to 
demonstrate superior efficacy on change from baseline week 24 in physical functioning (by WOMAC) or 
stiffness (by WOMAC), respectively. With the outcomes already at hand, this is however of lesser 
importance and by now a matter of assessment. 
Study UX023-CL303 comprise a double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week treatment Period, an open-
label 24-week treatment continuation period during which subjects in the placebo group crossed over to 
treatment with burosumab, and an open-label 48-week treatment extension period. Focus for the 
assessment of the burosumab efficacy is the primary week 24 analysis (interim database lock on 23 
March 2017). The SAP (version 1.0) was dated 28 November 2016 and the SAP version 2.0 was dated 31 
January 2017, analysis details should thereby have been decided and defined prior to the performance of 
the primary analysis. In SAP version 2.0 a revision history is included describing the changes made and 
their rationale. This is appreciated.  
The analysis of secondary endpoints was to be performed only if statistical significance (p<0.05) was 
reached in the analysis of the primary endpoint. This gatekeeping as well as the use of the Hochberg 
method for the three key secondary endpoints is agreed. The efficacy analysis was to include all 
randomised subjects who had received at least one dose of investigational product. This was achieved by 
all subjects and hence, the efficacy analysis was based on all randomised subjects. Both the analysis of 
the primary and key secondary endpoints, with one exception, were planned taking stratification factors 
into account. The exception was for the analysis of Worst Pain by BPI.

The primary Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and the GEE analyses used for the analyses of change from 
baseline for the key PRO endpoints could be acceptable albeit the latter could be criticised given the 
missing at random assumption and the applicant was further requested to better define the GEE model 
applied with a rationale for its appropriateness considering that the GEE technique is asymptotic, hence 
generally requiring large total sample sizes. Means and parametric approaches to statistical analysis are 
presented for many of the endpoints. These methods require assumptions around normality of underlying 
distributions within groups. The MAH was hence requested to confirm that the assumption of normality of 
the underlying data had been confirmed in all cases, particularly in relation to the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. Further, additional analyses were requested. The applicant used the Shapiro-Wilk 
test of normality to check the baseline data and the change from baseline data of key secondary PRO 
endpoints. The tests suggest that the change scores were non-normal for all measures (BPI Worse Pain 
Score, WOMAC Physical Function and WOMAC Stiffness) at 12 and 24 weeks for the burosumab group, 
and non-normal for WOMAC stiffness at 12 and 24 weeks for placebo. As requested, the MAH also 
reanalysed the key secondary endpoints using a repeated measures ANCOVA. However, Given the non-
normality in the data further analysis for the normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance was 
presented to confirm the appropriateness of the ANCOVA method on these key secondary endpoints. This 
is accepted. 
The working correlation/covariance structure used for the generalised estimating equations (GEEs) was 
compound symmetry, which assumes constant variance/covariance over time. The applicant was also to 
confirm whether this assumption is valid (particularly to week 24 but also to week 48) and to consider the 
use of an alternative covariance structure (i.e. unstructured) in a sensitivity analysis. As clarified with the 
MAH’s response and the new analysis performed, the results at 24 weeks from using the Compound 
symmetry (CS) and Unstructured (UN) covariance structure were identical (to the third decimal place).  
In the end, all subjects but one in the burosumab arm completed the double-blind 24-week treatment 
period. This does not necessarily imply that all patients had data for all measurement time-points; also, 
as clear from the presentation of outcomes, there were a few subjects excluded in the key secondary 
analyses and the applicant was requested to clarify. Further, a few additional analyses were requested 
whereof one of them was an analysis of Worst Pain (by BPI) that mirrored restrictions implied by actual 
randomisation. 
Study conduct UX023-CL303 
Due to a mistake in the IWRS, the actual randomisation stratification was based on the mean of the Brief 
pain index (BPI) Average Pain scores prior to baseline instead of on the mean of the 7 days of BPI Worst 
Pain diary scores prior to baseline visit, as specified in the study protocol.  
The explanation for the randomisation error is stated to have been due to that the paper patient diary did 
not include questions 1 and 2 of the full BPI, BPI Q3 (Worst Pain) was hence labelled question 1 and BPI 
Q5 (Average Pain) was labelled question 3 of the patient diary. Therefore, IWRS was programmed to 
incorrectly stratify subjects based on the mean of the 7 daily diary labelled question 3. This sounds like a 
reasonable explanation and thereby there is no concern implied regarding the randomisation procedure 
and the stratification at randomisation per se.  
Although it could be agreed that average pain and worst pain seem correlated, while balance was 
achieved for average pain at screening, there was an imbalance in pain intensity based on BPI worst pain 
between randomised arms, as BPI worst pain was >6.0 in 75% of the subjects in the burosumab versus 
59% in the placebo arm. In addition: ‘To assess the relationship of the stratification variables based on 
BPI Worst Pain and BPI Average Pain, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient will be obtained on the 
continuous variables of BPI Worst Pain and Average Pain.’ This approach assumes the pain scores are 
normally distributed. As the scores may not be normally distributed and the sample size is not large, the 
MAH was requested to discuss whether use of a Spearman’s correlation coefficient might have been more 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 89/151 
 
 
  
  
appropriate in this instance. In reply, the MAH further assessed the relationship of Baseline BPI Worst 
Pain and Baseline BPI Average Pain with the Spearman’s correlation coefficient with the final data from 
Study UX023-CL303. The correlation coefficients between these two pain scores were 0.82028 (Pearson, 
p < 0.0001) and 0.82332 (Spearman, p < 0.0001), respectively, both hence showing that the continuous 
variables of the two pain scores (BPI Worst Pain and Average Pain) at baseline were highly associated.  
Overall, 40% of the study population were stratified as having a BPI ≤6/10 instead of >6/10, if the 
planned randomisation stratification had been used. This affected more subjects in the burosumab versus 
the placebo arm (46% vs 35%, respectively). However, a prespecified sensitivity analysis adjusting for 
the planned randomisation stratification based on BPI Worst Pain was consistent with the primary analysis 
based on the actual stratification, indicating that the erroneous stratification did not affect the outcome of 
the primary endpoint. It could however be expected to have had a greater impact on the key secondary 
analyses, as discussed below.  
Originally, there was one key secondary endpoint (pain). Two “other” secondary endpoints, originally the 
last endpoints in a list of a number of secondary “other” endpoints, were identified and elevated as key 
secondary while the study was ongoing. This update was implemented in the study protocol with protocol 
amendment 3 i.e. only after the primary analysis database lock. In the study report for the week 24 
analysis, amendment 3 is mentioned but not presented in the report. This is agreed. Instead, 
documentation that can support that all three key secondary analyses had been planned before the 
primary analysis data cut-off and the date for the data snapshot and unblinding of data, is found in the 
SAP (version 1.0, dated 28 November 2016). Upon request the MAH explained that the amendment in 
question took time to complete due to that several changes to the study protocol were discussed and that 
more data from another study (UX023-CL001) was awaited before finally deciding on key endpoints.  
According to the MAH, the addition of two key secondary endpoints was made to reflect that for the 
purposes of the Week 24 primary statistical analysis, it was considered that the endpoint model that best 
characterized the clinical relevance of burosumab treatment on patient symptoms should analyse BPI 
Worst Pain, in conjunction with the WOMAC Stiffness and Physical Function domains as key secondary 
endpoints. This is not considered a sufficient justification for such an important alteration of key 
secondary endpoints at the end of the double-blind treatment period. The MAH was required to provide a 
scientific rationale for the amendment of two additional key secondary endpoints during the course of the 
study. The MAH has clarified that in discussing the study with the FDA, the FDA proposed to add BPI 
Worst pain as co-primary endpoint. However, the MAH decided to keep Serum phosphate as the single 
primary outcome and to instead assign BPI Worst pain a key secondary endpoint. The MAH explained 
their late action with a wish to await more data from another study (UX023-CL001) before finally deciding 
on key endpoints. After taking these results into consideration, the MAH decided that BPI Worst pain was 
not sufficient to address the spectrum of XLH symptomatology. In particular, according to the concept 
elicitation patient interviews, stiffness was the most prevalent and impactful XLH symptom. Therefore, 
the MAH decided to include WOMAC Stiffness and WOMAC Physical function as two supplementary key 
secondary endpoints in the study.  
Major protocol deviations were reported more often in the burosumab treatment group (60% vs 46%). In 
addition, 7/68 (10%) of the burosumab treated subjects were partially unblinded at some time-point 
during the placebo-controlled treatment period versus none in the placebo arm, either accidentally or per 
protocol, due to hyperphosphataemia and sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint and secondary 
endpoints, as well as for the 6MWT without the seven unblinded subjects and separately for the seven 
subjects. Regarding the five cases with unblinding of assigned treatment according to protocol due to a 
need of dose adjustments, the MAH has clarified that although the notation is “subject unblinded”, it was 
only the investigator that was unblinded; the subject was still to be unaware of their assigned treatment. 
The protocol associated unblinding of fives subjects is therefore considered be of a lesser concern than 
initially thought.  
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 90/151 
 
 
  
  
Two additional subjects reported unblinding as major protocol deviation but according to the MAH, again 
only study personnel was unblinded to treatment. However, for one of these two subjects, a major 
protocol deviation of Unblinding described as “Patient had phosphorus level reported when completing 
local lab draw” was reported. This may indicate that the subject was actually informed. Notwithstanding, 
this is not expected to have affected the outcome.  
In the provided plots, the results from the seven subjects with reported unblinding were distributed 
evenly within the remainder of the burosumab-treated group; however, there are two subjects that are 
among the extremes. It is unclear whether it is the same subjects irrespective of endpoint. As the MAH 
has clarified that in at least 6/7 events of unblinding, unblinding meant that the Investigator and site staff 
would have been exposed to the information and not the subjects, the issue is not further pursued. 
The sensitivity analyses performed implies, as could be expected, decreased differences between the two 
randomised arms. For BPI Worst pain and WOMAC Physical Function that did not reach statistical 
significance in the primary analysis, there is no change regarding what conclusions that can be drawn. For 
WOMAC Stiffness the difference between treatment arms was no longer statistically significant. Taking 
the clarifications regarding the nature of unblinding into account, the primary conclusion is still considered 
valid. 
Stratification by region was not specified in the protocol but is stated to have been conducted for 
operational and logistic considerations. The justification for why region was used for stratification is 
acceptable; the failure of describing this in the study protocol could be considered worrying regarding 
study conduct. An update of the study protocol to clarify that randomisation was stratified not only by 
baseline pain intensity, but also by region (North America/European Union, Japan, and South Korea) was 
only made long after recruitment was completed, i.e. within protocol amendment 3 after the interim 
database lock (amendment 3 was dated 31 March 2017, the Interim Database Lock occurred 23 March 
2017). The balance achieved between the treatment arms support that randomisation was stratified also 
for region. However, the numbers outside US/Europe were very small (only 18 in total) limiting 
generalisability. 
In a limited study population, double stratifications inevitably lead to some imbalances between the 
treatment arms for other baseline parameters. Baseline serum phosphorus, which is assessed in the 
primary endpoint, was comparable between the treatment arms: 1.92 mg/dL [0.62 mmol/L] in the 
placebo arm and 2.03 mg/dL [0.66 mmol/L] in the burosumab arm. The mean age was somewhat higher 
in the burosumab arm compared to placebo (41.3 vs 38.6 years, respectively). This is not expected to 
affect the outcome of the study per se. However, there were more subjects in the oldest age range (> 
50-65 years) in the burosumab group vs placebo (16 vs 10). An older patient population with a longer 
disease duration may influence the results, particularly in relation to the secondary and exploratory 
endpoints. Upon request, the MAH has conducted subgroup analyses demonstrating that no significant 
interaction was identified for the primary endpoint, nor for the key secondary endpoints of WOMAC 
Physical Function, WOMAC Stiffness and BPI Pain. Further, the small non-statistically significant difference 
in the number of patients aged >50 years between the placebo and burosumab groups is unlikely to have 
affected the results. 
Due to the erroneous stratification by baseline pain, there was an imbalance in pain intensity between the 
treatment arms, as BPI worst pain was >6.0 in 75% of the subjects in the burosumab versus 59% in the 
placebo arm. This may have impact in the Patient reported outcomes (PROs). Both osteoarthritis and 
nephrocalcinosis were reported more often at baseline in the treatment arm (69% vs 58% respectively 
for osteoarthritis and 16% vs 8% for nephrocalcinosis), as were Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (44% vs 36%) and General disorders and administration site conditions (mainly pain, fatigue 
and pyrexia) (21% vs 14%). These are symptoms that may be associated with XLH. Also, even though 
the use of pain medication per se was balanced between the treatment arms (burosumab 69%, placebo 
67%), use of opioids was more common in the burosumab arm, 25% vs 20% in the placebo arm.

Furthermore, use of the “other” pain medications was imbalanced between treatment groups, being 
reported by 10% of subjects in the burosumab group versus 1.5% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Taken together, this may implicate that the treatment arms were not fully balanced regarding baseline 
pain and XLH manifestations. The MAH was asked to comment on the any potential impact of this 
imbalance on the outcome of the study, particularly with respect to the key secondary objectives. In 
response, the MAH provided interaction analyses. The MAH argues that the unbalance has had negligible 
impact on the study outcome. According to the MAH, one statistically significant interaction was detected, 
between presence of nephrocalcinosis at baseline and BPI Worst Pain (p= 0.0475). The observed 
interaction between the presence of baseline nephrocalcinosis and BPI Worst pain is difficult to interpret 
as nephrocalcinosis is normally asymptomatic. The value of interaction testing is limited in such small 
population as the power for detection of interactions is considered too low.  
The Applicant has provided Forest plots displaying subgroup analysis for five baseline parameters not fully 
balanced, i.e. use of pain medication, use of opioid pain medication, baseline presence of osteoarthritis 
and baseline presence of nephrocalcinosis, with regard to the three key secondary endpoints as 
requested. None of the subgroups showed a consistent additional benefit in favour of burosumab across 
these key secondary endpoints, above that seen in the All Subjects group. Although statistical significance 
was not shown for most subgroups, the point estimate favours burosumab in all subgroups for the three 
key secondary endpoints.  
The data cut-off date for the primary week 24 analysis was 22 December 2016. After the interim 
database lock and subsequent unblinding of data for the primary week 24 analysis on 23 March 2017, the 
database was unlocked and relocked twice, in September 2017 and in October 2017. According to the 
applicant, each unlock and relock followed standard operating procedures. The data changes at the site 
level requiring the unlocks were: (1) WOMAC Stiffness; (2) six-minute walk test (6MWT) baseline 
distance; and (3) several AEs that investigators had updated or added. This implied that e.g. WOMAC 
Stiffness, i.e. one of the three proposed key secondary endpoints, was re-analysed and currently it is the 
results from this re-analysis that has been presented. This was not agreed and the MAH has presented 
arguments for why the corrected analysis is considered valid. However, despite that the correction of data 
may have been with all the best operating procedures in place, it was based on what may have been a 
minor mistake, and for the endpoint based on WOMAC Stiffness, concerned one data point alone. This is a 
question of scientific integrity and validity that applies in general, irrespective of the nature of correction. 
Hence, the only formally valid outcome is the one based on the data collected and cleaned before 
unblinding (see below). 
Study conduct UX023-CL304 
Originally, the four bone mineralisation parameters Osteoid volume as a percentage of total bone volume 
(OV/BV), Osteoid thickness (O.Th), Osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS) and Mineralization lag time 
(MLt) were all listed as primary endpoints, but in protocol amendment 2, dated 07 October 2016, this was 
narrowed to leave OV/BV as the single primary efficacy endpoint. The other histomorphometric 
parameters were specified as secondary endpoints. This was done during the course of the study (First 
subject signed informed consent, 23 December 2015), but before the data cut-off date for this report, 30 
August 2017.  
The MAH has clarified that the primary analysis was narrowed to focus on osteoid volume, as all four 
parameters as the primary endpoints would have made the proper evaluation and interpretation of study 
results more complex without considering the multiplicity. The four parameters are not fully independent 
of each other, as the osteoid volume (OV) is the product of osteoid thickness (OTh) and osteoid surface 
(OS), which can support the use of osteoid volume/bone volume (OV/BV) only as primary endpoint.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study populations 
The mean age across the studies ranged from 40 to 50 years. In all studies, most subjects (57-70%) 
were women and most subjects (64-96%) were white.  
In all studies except UX023-CL304, baseline serum phosphorus ranged from 1.85-1.98 mg/dL [0.60-0.64 
mmol/L] (normal range 2.5-4.5 mg/dL [0.81-1.45 mmol/L]), whereas in UX023-CL304, baseline serum 
phosphorus was 2.24 mg/dL [0.72 mmol/L]. 
In the other studies in adult XLH patients, subjects receiving concomitant treatment with phosphate 
supplementation and/or D-vitamin analogues within 10-21 days prior to screening. As opposed to this, in 
study UX023-CL304, the use of phosphate supplementation and/or D-vitamin analogues were not allowed 
within two years prior to screening. The small difference in mean baseline serum phosphorus may 
indicate that this difference in eligibility criteria resulted in a slightly different study population in UX023-
CL304 compared to the other studies. 
With the exception of Study KRN23-INT-001, where 5/30 subjects (17%) discontinued treatment, 
90-100% of the subjects in the clinical studies completed the study treatment.  
Results 
Serum phosphate (primary and secondary endpoints) 
Study UX023-CL303 met its primary endpoint as a considerably larger proportion of the subjects in the 
burosumab versus the placebo treatment arm achieved mean serum phosphorus levels above the lower 
level of normal at the midpoint of the dose interval (94% vs 8%, respectively; p<0.0001).  
A pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed to assess the impact of the 
stratification misclassification using BPI Average Pain rather than the planned BPI Worst Pain score for 
randomisation. This analysis produced identical results as those of the primary analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses and several subgroup analyses were all consistent with the primary analysis with one 
exception. For the subgroup of subjects from South Korea, a significant difference between treatment 
groups was not observed. However, this subgroup included only four subjects in the burosumab group 
and three subjects in the placebo group, precluding relevant conclusions. 
In the burosumab arm, baseline mean serum phosphate was 2.03 mg/dL [0.66 mmol/L] and serum 
phosphorus across the midpoints of dose cycles during the placebo-controlled period through Week 24 
was 3.24 mg/dL [1.05 mmol/L], levelling out to 3.02 mg/dL [0.98 mmol/L] Week 24-48. The 
corresponding vales for the placebo arm was 1.92 mg/dL [0.62 mmol/L] at baseline and 2.08 mg/dL 
[0.67 mmol/L] across the midpoints of dose cycles through Week 24. 
Mean serum phosphorus at Week 24 (trough level) was 2.53 mg/dL [0.82 mmol/L] in the burosumab arm 
and 2.07 mg/dL [0.67 mmol/L] in the placebo arm. The corresponding number at Week 48 was 2.47 
mg/dL [0.80 mmol/L] for both treatment arms. Thus, the increase in trough phosphate level seems to be 
sustained up to 48 weeks. 
Serum phosphate was a primary or secondary endpoint in the open-label studies in the adult clinical 
development program. The results from these studies support the result from main study UX023-CL303. 
The increase in serum phosphorus concentration with burosumab treatment in adults is considered solid 
and convincing. This is a clear indication that the effect of burosumab on FGF23 function in adults is 
consistent with the effect in the paediatric population. Even though serum phosphate could be seen as a 
surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for clinical effect, chronic hypophosphataemia is a major contributor 
to the pathophysiology of the disease. Low serum phosphate hampers normal bone calcification and bone

remodelling, which in turn leads to rickets symptoms, i.e. impaired skeleton development with short 
stature, bowing and bone deformity in children and to fractures, pseudofractures and enthesopathy in 
adults. Secondary to this, osteoarthritis and joint destruction may develop due to skeletal malformation 
and misalignment of joints, all with a major impact on the patients’ quality of life. In severe 
hypophosphataemia, the low serum phosphate concentration per se may be also symptomatic. Some of 
these XLH manifestations are considered irreversible while others, e.g. bone mineralisation, are deemed 
modifiable with treatment. It is considered reasonable to assume that normalisation of serum phosphate 
may be beneficial also in the adult population.  
Other pharmacodynamic endpoints 
The high serum levels of FGF23 associated with XLH inhibits phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys, as 
determined by renal tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). 
As expected from the mechanism of action, TmP/GFR increased with burosumab treatment in all studies. 
In UX023-CL303, the difference between the treatment arms was significant Week 24. 
Vitamin-D is suppressed by FGF-23. This is at least a part of the explanation to why Serum Vitamin-D 
(i.e., 1,25(OH)2D) is low in XLH-patients in spite of their hypophosphataemia, which is normally a strong 
stimulator of active Vitamin-D. Decreasing FGF23 levels by burosumab treatment led to a rapid increase 
1,25(OH)2D in all studies, which was also expected. In UX023-CL303, the difference between the 
treatment arms was significant Week 22 (1,25(OH)2D was not measured at Week 24) 
This increase was not sustained throughout the study durations. It is hypothesised by the MAH that this 
likely represents normal feedback regulation as phosphate-calcium homeostasis improves with 
burosumab therapy.  
Patient reported outcome scales (secondary endpoints). 
Patient reported outcome scales (PRO) were secondary endpoints in UX023-CL303 and secondary 
endpoints in all studies. The reliability of subjective reports of perceived symptoms in an open-label 
setting is questioned. This is exemplified by the WOMAC Stiffness and WOMAC Physical Function scores in 
study UX023-CL303, where improvement in LS mean from baseline in the burosumab treatment arm 
levelled out between Week 12 and Week 24 but increased again between Week 24 and Week 48, 
implicating that the open-label design may indeed have affected the outcome. Therefore, only PRO data 
from the placebo-controlled, double-blind period of UX023-CL303 are discussed below.  
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scales are 10-point scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (as bad as you can 
imagine). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scales ranges 
from 0 (best health state) to 100 (worst).  
As discussed above, the BPI Worst Pain score at week 24 was the only originally prespecified key 
secondary endpoint that was tested at 0.05 significance level. The mean worst pain decreased in the 
placebo group from 6.5 to 6.1 and from 6.8 to 5.8 in the burosumab group. The difference was not 
statistically significant. 
WOMAC Stiffness score and WOMAC Physical Function score were identified as key secondary efficacy 
endpoints in addition to BPI Worst Pain score during the course of the study. Both scales shoved 
improvements in the burosumab arm compared to placebo. In the burosumab arm, WOMAC Physical 
Function score decreased from 51 to 43 points between baseline and Week 24 compared to 44 to 43 in 
the placebo arm. The baseline scores were not balanced between the treatment arms; in fact, the 
difference between the baseline score was similar to the difference between baseline and Week 24 score 
in the burosumab arm. The corresponding numbers for WOMAC Stiffness score was 65 to 54 in the 
burosumab arm and 61 to 60 in the placebo arm. In this analysis, the baseline scores were better 
balanced. Applying the Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing for the three endpoints, the difference 
between the treatment arms in WOMAC Stiffness score at Week 24 was significant at the p<0.0167 level.

Upon request, the MAH has provided information on what could be considered minimal clinical important 
difference (MCID) for the key secondary endpoints. According to the MAH, the MCID for adults with XLH 
are 1.72 for the BPI-SF Worst Pain score, 9.3 for the WOMAC Physical Function score, and 10.0 for the 
WOMAC Stiffness score. For WOMAC Stiffness, mean improvement corresponding to MCID was reached 
by approximately Week 36 and for WOMAC Physical function beyond Week 96, whereas the mean 
improvements did not reach MCID for BPI Worst pain during the course of the study. 
As stated by the applicant, model-based estimates for WOMAC Stiffness, 6MWT, and fractures were 
reanalysed for the placebo-controlled treatment period because additional or corrected data were 
provided for these endpoints after the interim database lock for the primary analysis. Presented above is 
the post-hoc “corrected” analysis of WOMAC Stiffness. In the original analysis presented in the Week 24 
analysis CSR, the LS mean (SE) difference between treatment groups (burosumab-placebo) in the change 
from baseline to Week 24 was -8.1 (3.24) (p=0.0122); to be compared with the outcome from the 
reanalysis -8.3 (3.25) (p=0.0106). The difference between the treatment arms was statistically 
significant irrespective of analysis and the difference in the point estimates minor. Whenever applicable, it 
should however be the original analysis that is presented e.g. in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
As reported by the applicant, all subjects but one continued in the study through week 24. To be included 
in the analysis of the key PRO endpoints, subjects were required to have a baseline and at least one post-
baseline assessment. In the analyses, data from one (placebo) or, one or two subjects (burosumab) have 
been excluded. Although small numbers, the applicant was requested to clarify and, in addition, clarify 
whether there were any patients that were included in the analyses that lacked measurements at week 
24. In response, the MAH has made clear that all subjects had available baseline and week 12 data, albeit 
three subjects, one in the placebo arm and two in the burosumab arm, had missing or partially missing 
data at Week 24 and also that they, contrary to the assessor’s interpretation, were included in the Week 
24 analysis of BPI Worst Pain, WOMAC Stiffness and WOMAC Physical Function.  Sensitivity analyses have 
been presented using LOCF, BOCF and mBOCF imputation methods respectively. Irrespective of method 
used, outcomes were consistent with those from the primary analysis. All three imputation methods can 
however be criticised. The MAH replied that other approaches were not considered in the Study UX023-
CL303 SAP, primarily because it was anticipated that there would be very few missing data. Given 
analysis results and provided the number of subjects with missing data remains at three, no new 
sensitivity analyses are considered needed. 
Sensitivity analyses of the (key) secondary endpoints were performed to assess the impact of 
randomisation stratification by average pain (BPI Q5) rather than the planned stratification by worst pain 
(BPI Q3)//which used the planned randomisation stratification factor based on BPI Worst Pain score 
instead of the actual randomisation stratification factor based on BPI Average Pain score in the GEE 
model. These are endorsed for sensitivity purpose. 
For change from baseline to Week 24 in BPI Worst Pain score, the sensitivity analysis adjusted for the 
baseline BPI Average Pain score instead of the baseline BPI Worst pain score in the GEE model. The 
outcome was similar to the outcome of the primary analysis. In change from baseline analyses, the 
baseline value should be included as a covariate, i.e. baseline BPI Worst pain score should be included in 
the analysis of change from baseline to Week 24 in BPI Worst Pain score. Instead, considered lacking was 
an analysis reflecting the restriction on the randomisation implied by the stratification using a model that 
also included the baseline BPI worst pain score as a covariate. Two analyses were requested; one 
adjusting for the actual stratification factor (average pain) and one adjusting for the planned stratification 
factor (worst pain). These have been provided, showing only minor differences compared with the initially 
presented primary analysis.  
The secondary endpoints in UX023-CL303 also included BPI Pain Severity, BPI Pain interference, Brief 
Fatigue Inventory (BFI; range 1-10) Worst Fatigue, and BFI Global Fatigue. There was a trend towards a 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 95/151 
 
 
  
  
favourable effect of burosumab in BPI Pain Severity score; however, no difference between the treatment 
arms was seen in BPI Pain interference, BFI Worst Fatigue, and BFI Global Fatigue. 
Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was included as an exploratory endpoint in UX023-
CL303. In this assessment, the subjects first scored their perception of disease severity on a scale from 1 
(normal) to 4 (severe) according to the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) instrument at 
baseline, thereafter, at week 24, the perception of improvement with treatment over time was scored on 
a scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse) according to the PGI-I. No meaningful 
difference between the treatment arms in PGI-I was seen at Week 24. 
In summary, the results from the PRO endpoints are not fully concordant, with a trend towards a positive 
impact of burosumab on BPI Worst Pain, WOMAC Stiffness score (significant if applying the Hochberg 
adjustment for multiple testing), WOMAC Physical Function and BPI Pain Severity but with no meaningful 
difference between the treatment arms in BPI Pain interference, BFI Worst Fatigue, BFI Global Fatigue 
and PGI-I. Notwithstanding, while the quantitative effect of burosumab on PROs is considered modest, 
patients’ experiences of symptom and activity improvement, as reported in patient interviews and 
feedback, support the view that the effects are meaningful to patients. The totality of these data and the 
consistency of effect among the assessments demonstrate that, despite the long-term complications and 
symptoms experienced by adults with XLH, burosumab improves symptoms and function that are 
clinically meaningful to patients. 
Bone related endpoints  
The primary objective in study UX023-CL304 was to establish the effect of burosumab treatment on 
improvement in XLH-associated osteomalacia (defective bone mineralisation) as determined by ration 
between osteoid (unmineralized bone) volume and total bone volume (OV/BV) by iliac bone biopsies. 
OV/BV is elevated in osteomalacia. 
The study met its primary endpoint as the increased OV/BV ratio decreased by 54% from baseline to 
Week 48 (P<0.0001).  
This is supported by statistically significant reductions also in osteoid thickness (OTh) and in ratio of 
osteoid surface to total bone surface (OS/BS). In comparison to reference ranges for histomorphometric 
bone parameters in healthy postmenopausal women (Recker et al. 1988), none of the parameters were 
fully normalised. At Baseline, all subjects had osteomalacia as determined by evaluation of the iliac crest 
bone biopsy; nearly half of the subjects in the Primary Analysis Set (5/11, 45%) presented with severe 
osteomalacia. The MAH has clarified that after 48 weeks of burosumab treatment, subsequent bone 
biopsy revealed severe osteomalacia in one subject (9%), with mild osteomalacia in the remaining 10 
subjects. This suggests that the normalisation of bone structure is slow.  
Other secondary endpoints in this study were mineralization lag time (MLt), the proportion of the bone 
surface that is active in mineralization at a specific time (MS/BS) and the bone formation rate per bone 
surface (BFR/BS). Due to the large number of imputed values, the results on mineralization lag time 
(MLt) are not considered fully robust. 
Notable, at Week 48, the bone formation rate per bone surface (BFR/BS) was actually lower than at 
baseline (mean [SD] change from Baseline of -4.90 [27.356] μm3/μm2/year); however, the large SD 
precludes any firm conclusions. 
Taken together, the data from Study UX023-CL304 support a positive effect of burosumab on bone 
mineralisation.  
This is further supported by the effect on pharmacodynamic bone markers. In all adult studies, 
burosumab effect on the bone formation marker P1NP and the bone resorption marker CTx was either a 
primary pharmacodynamic endpoint (UX023-CL203) or a secondary pharmacodynamic/efficacy endpoint 
(the other studies). For both markers, a marked increase was seen on burosumab treatment, reaching 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 96/151 
 
 
  
  
maximum after 12-24 weeks of treatment, after which a decrease towards baseline is seen; however, the 
levels remaining above baseline at Week 48. In their response document, the MAH has provided data on 
the bone formation marker P1NP and the bone degradation marker CTx up to Week 96 in Study UX023-
CL303 and UX023-CL304. In both studies, serum concentration of P1NP and CTx continued decreasing 
towards, but not reaching, baseline values at Week 96. In Study UX023-CL303, the decrease in serum 
concentrations for both markers were very similar in both treatment arms however with a delay of 24 
weeks in the placebo→burosumab group. The increase in P1NP seemed to be more pronounced and the 
decrease slower than that of CTx in both studies, suggesting a positive remodelling balance with a net 
increase in bone formation. The slow normalisation of bone structure as discussed above may serve as an 
explanation to why the bone markers P1NP and CTx remain elevated beyond Week 96.  
Fracture/pseudofracture healing and enthesopathy 
Fracture/ pseudofracture healing were assessed in studies, UX023-CL303, UX023-CL203 and UX023-
CL304.  
In study UX023-CL303, healing of active fractures and pseudofractures detected by x-ray at baseline to 
the end of the study was an exploratory endpoint, which hampers the impact of the data.  
To minimise the risk of bias in reviewing-rays, the MAH contracted Biomedical Systems, Inc. (BMS) to 
provide an independent review of site-acquired x-ray data. One independent reviewer was to review the 
baseline skeletal survey x-rays and indicate if there are active or non-active bone fractures and pseudo-
fractures and their locations. Two different independent reviewers assessed the targeted x-ray time point 
images, comparing the current time point image with the image from the baseline time point or the time 
point the fracture was initially identified. This approach is considered acceptable. 
In the burosumab treatment arm more active fractures were healed (7/14 [50%]) or partially healed 
(3/14 [21%]) at Week 24 compared to placebo (0% and 6/13 [46%], respectively). The corresponding 
numbers for active pseudofractures were 21/51 [41%] healed and 13/51 [26%] partially healed in the 
burosumab arm and 7/78 [9%] and 22/78 [28%], respectively, in the placebo arm.  
The numbers indicate a difference in fracture/pseudofracture healing in favour of burosumab. However, 
additional new fractures/pseudofractures occurred in both arms by the week 24; 8 in the placebo arm and 
6 in the burosumab arm. As discussed above, bone structure was not completely normalised at Week 48 
in bone biopsies in Study UX023-CL304, indicating that normalisation of the bone may take months or 
even years. This could contribute to a continued incidence of new fractures despite burosumab treatment. 
This may be further supported by the fact that six new fractures were reported in the burosumab arm 
Week 0-24 compared to one fracture Week 24-36 and none Week 36-48. 
No comparison in fracture healing between the treatment arms was planned. In a post hoc analysis using 
a hierarchical generalised linear mixed proportional odds model showed an odds ratio between 
burosumab vs placebo for fracture healing of 16.8 (95% CI 4.9, 57.0; p<0.0001). 
Data on fracture healing from study UX023-203 will be provided separately according to the MAH. It is 
not specified whether this will be done within this procedure or in the final study report.  
In study UX023-CL304, four active pseudofractures and no active fractures were reported in 14 subjects 
at baseline. At Week 48, three of the pseudofractures were fully healed and no information was available 
in the remaining case. Due to the low number of events, no conclusions are possible, especially in the 
absence of healing time for pseudofractures in adult XLH subjects without treatment. The absence of new 
events during the 48-week period is however acknowledged. 
No positive burosumab effect on enthesopathy burden was seen at Week 24. In fact, a numerically, but 
not statistically, better effect was seen in the placebo treatment arm. However, the MAH’s note that due 
to inclusion of this analysis in an amendment during the course of the study, only approximately 10-12 
subjects in each treatment arm had Week 24 measurement. Notwithstanding, the LS mean change from 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 97/151 
 
 
  
  
Baseline to Week 48 was -0.53 cm in the burosumab→burosumab group and -0.12 cm in the 
placebo→burosumab group. Thus, there was no meaningful change from Baseline at Week 48 for total 
calcaneal enthesopathy burden. Additional data provided as response to the first List of questions indicate 
that no positive effect on enthesopathy was seen beyond Week 48 either in Study UX023-CL303. The 
MAH has clarified that enthesopathy is not considered a modifiable manifestation of XLH. 
The MAH points out that adult XLH patients have pain from many sources (e.g. skeletal deformity, 
osteomalacia, osteoarthritis, pseudofractures and fractures, enthesopathy), not all aspects of which may 
resolve with burosumab treatment due to their cause or chronicity. It is acknowledged that these subjects 
have lived all their lives with the cumulative effects of abnormal bone mineralization and carry a 
substantial, unresolved burden of disease.  In the context of chronic osteomalacia, full recovery of bone 
health may require longer burosumab treatment. A range of studies are planned aimed at collecting 
longer term data on bone health in burosumab treated patients. These include two extension studies 
(BUR-02 and KRN23-004) to the phase 3 studies (UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304), UX023-CL401 which 
is a 10-year DMP, the European registry (2018-16-EU-BUR) which will run for 10 years and an Asian 
observational study (Sunflower) of 5-year duration. Relevant safety reports and study progress reports 
will be provided in routine PSURs. 
Mobility test 
Six-minute walking test (6MWT) and “timed up and go”-test (TUG) were exploratory endpoints in UX023-
CL303.  
6MWT showed an improved mean walking distance of 14.8m at Week 24 and of 30.5m at Week 48 from 
mean baseline walking distance (357 m) in the burosumab arm. In the placebo treatment arm, the mean 
walking distance decreased with 5 m through Week 24. The recorded difference between the groups is 
deemed clinically relevant.  
TUG was added as an exploratory endpoint approximately 9 months after enrolment of the first subject 
No baseline values are recorded and only nine Week 24-recordings of TUG exist in study U023-CL303. 
Therefore, no meaningful analysis of this endpoint is deemed possible. 
In Study UX023-CL302, a strong positive trend on 6 MWT and a statistically significant effect on TUG was 
seen with burosumab treatment. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Crysvita has a conditional marketing authorisation for treatment of children with XLH from the age of one 
year and adolescents with growing skeletons. No children were included in the studies forming the adult 
clinical development program assessed in this report.  
Adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates have not been included in any clinical studies, neither in 
the paediatric nor the adult development program. However, the applicant states that in the primary 
paediatric Study UX023-CL201, supporting the current indication, that there were 11 adolescent subjects 
included identified as having closed growth plates during the study. This is further discussed in the clinical 
safety section.  
The proposed posology for this population is based on PK/PD modelling. This is further discussed in the 
pharmacokinetic section.  
It is considered reasonable that the effect of burosumab could be extrapolated from the adult population 
given the same exposure.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The increase in serum phosphorus concentration with burosumab treatment in adults is considered solid 
and convincing. This is a clear indication that the effect of burosumab on FGF23 function in adults is 
consistent with the effect in the paediatric population. Even though serum phosphate could be seen as a 
surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for clinical effect, chronic hypophosphataemia is a major contributor 
to the pathophysiology of the disease. It is anticipated that normalisation of serum phosphate may have a 
beneficial effect on modifiable XLH manifestations, e.g. improved bone calcification, and possibly also 
decrease the deterioration rate of irreversible XLH damages. In addition, normalisation of serum 
phosphate should have a direct positive effect on symptoms from low serum phosphate per se, e.g. 
muscle weakness and fatigue. It is therefore agreed with the MAH, that the increase in serum phosphorus 
concentration with burosumab treatment in adults could be considered clinically relevant. 
While the quantitative effect of burosumab on PROs is considered modest, patients’ experiences of 
symptom and activity improvement, as reported in patient interviews and feedback, support the view that 
the effects are meaningful to patients. Limited data on fracture healing, bone mineralisation and bone 
markers also pose a support for a positive effect of burosumab also in adults with XLH.  
Some issues related to study conduct were identified, e.g. alterations of the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, respectively, in studies UX023-CL304 and UX023-CL303 during the course of the study, failure 
to update the study protocol with this information in due time, erroneous stratification leading to some 
imbalance in baseline parameters etc. These issues were adequately addressed by the MAH during the 
procedure.  
The statistical methodology used for the analyses of change from baseline for the key PRO endpoints has 
been questioned. The MAH was requested to confirm that the assumption of normality of the underlying 
data had been confirmed in all cases, particularly in relation to the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Further, additional analyses were requested. The applicant used the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to 
check the baseline data and the change from baseline data of key secondary PRO endpoints. The tests 
suggest that the change scores were non-normal for all measures. As requested, the MAH also reanalysed 
the key secondary endpoints using a repeated measures ANCOVA. Further analysis for the normality of 
residuals and homogeneity of variance was presented to confirm the appropriateness of the ANCOVA 
method on these key secondary endpoints. This is accepted. 
Taken together, a positive effect of burosumab is considered shown also in the adult and adolescent 
populations.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The currently approved indication in paediatric patients (i.e. treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence 
of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons) was primarily 
based on data from completed Study UX023-CL201 and ongoing Study UX023-CL205. 
Study UX023-CL201 was a Phase 2, randomised, open-label study of 52 children between the ages of 5 to 
12 years with XLH, and Study UX023-CL205 is a Phase 2, open-label study of 13 children between the 
ages 1 to 4 years with XLH. In addition, data from ongoing Study UX023-CL301 (a randomised, Phase 3, 
open-label in 61 children between 1 and 12 years) have been provided in order to increase the 
recommended starting dose in children to 0.8 mg/kg (variation II/04).

The Summary of clinical safety (SCS) for adult XLH is based primarily on data from ongoing Phase 3 
Studies UX023-CL303 (double-blind, placebo-controlled) and UX023-CL304 (open-label), supported by 
data from ongoing open-label Phase 2 Study UX023-CL203 and 2 completed open-label Phase 1/2 studies 
(KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002) (Table 36). 
Table 34: Dataset Included in Clinical Summary of Safety of Adult XLH 
Note: Study KRN23-INT-002 was an extension study of subjects who participated in Study KRN23-INT-001 and met protocol criteria. Subjects in 
KRN23-US-02, KRN23-INT-001, and KRN23-INT-002 who met protocol criteria could participate in Study UX023-CL203. 
a: The cut-off date for SAE narratives reported in this document was 18 Feb 2019. 
b: At Week 24, subjects on placebo crossed over to receive burosumab. 
LPLV = last patient last visit; SAE = serious adverse event; XLH = X-linked hypophosphataemia. 
The adult safety assessment focuses on Study UX023-CL303, as it provides a placebo-controlled 
assessment of safety, comprises 76% (134/176) of the adult safety dataset, and largely represents the 
overall adult XLH subject population. Adult subjects in Study UX023-CL303 may have participated in up to 
2 burosumab studies; a total of 7 subjects in Study UX023-CL303 had previously participated in Studies 
KRN23-INT-001 (1 subject), KRN23-US-02 (2 subjects) and KRN23-001 (4 subjects).

MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; n = number of subjects with an event; N = total number of subjects who received at least 1 
dose of Investigational Product (burosumab or placebo); TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period of Study UX023-CL303 
occurred in the following SOCs: Infections and infestations (burosumab: 48.5%; placebo 45.5%); 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (burosumab: 38.2%; placebo: 45.5%); and Nervous 
system disorders (burosumab: 38.2%; placebo: 24.2%).  
The difference between the treatment groups in SOC Nervous system disorders was primarily attributed 
to the higher incidences of headache, dizziness, and RLS in the burosumab group than in the placebo 
group.  
The imbalance between the treatment groups in SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders was 
primarily attributed to the higher incidence of arthralgia, bone pain and musculoskeletal pain in the 
placebo group than in the burosumab group. At least twice as many subjects in the placebo group 
experienced these events compared with the burosumab group.  
Overall, across all repeat-dose studies in adults with XLH, the reported TEAEs by SOC followed a similar 
trend to the burosumab group in Study UX023-CL303 in terms of types and frequency.

included for subjects who participated in Study KRN23-INT-001 only, and subjects who participated in both studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-
INT-002. Twenty of those 28 subjects participated in Study UX023-CL203. 
Overall, in Study UX023-CL303, 15 (11.2%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs, none of which was 
considered by the Investigator as related to study drug. 
Through the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period (Week 24) in Phase 3 Study UX023-CL303, 4 subjects 
experienced SAEs, none of which was assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug.  
In the burosumab group, 2 (2.9%) subjects experienced SAEs, 1 each of irritable bowel syndrome and 
back pain. In the placebo group, 2 (3.0%) subjects experienced SAEs, 1 each of upper respiratory tract 
infection and invasive ductal breast carcinoma. 
After subjects switched from placebo to burosumab, 8 subjects in the placebo→burosumab group 
experienced SAEs. One subject each experienced cervical spinal stenosis, palpitations, arthralgia, joint 
range of motion decreased, periodontal disease, presyncope, pseudarthrosis and subdural haematoma. 
Five subjects in the burosumab→burosumab group had SAEs, including cholelithiasis, colitis, procedural 
nausea, procedural vomiting, spinal column stenosis, myelopathy and musculoskeletal pain. 
As of the data cut-off date of Study UX023-CL303, all SAEs had resolved except for the following: 
invasive ductal breast carcinoma, myelopathy/spinal column stenosis, and joint range of motion 
decreased. No SAE is Study UX023-CL303 was considered related to burosumab treatment. 
In Studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002, 3 subjects reported SAEs of cervical spinal stenosis, 
breast cancer and hypertensive crisis. No SAE was deemed as treatment related.  
In Study UX023-CL203, 9 subjects reported SAEs (1 subject each) of musculoskeletal chest pain, 
osteoarthritis, small intestinal obstruction, colon adenocarcinoma, chordoma, lung adenocarcinoma, 
cholecystitis acute, medical device site joint infection, and one related SAE of angioedema. 
In Study UX023-CL304, 2 subjects experienced SAEs (1 subject each) of migraine and paraesthesia. None 
of these were deemed as related by the Investigator.  
No action was taken with respect to study drug administration in any of the SAE cases. 
Narratives 
Narratives from selected SAEs reported in burosumab treated adult subjects before data cut-off for this 
application are summarised below. 
Serious Adverse Events in KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002 
Subject: Breast Cancer 
One subject with XLH treated with burosumab in both study KRN23-INT-001 (four doses) and KRN23-
INT-002 (12 doses). The last dose was administered on Study Day 311.  
On Study Day 271, the subject experienced a SAE of breast cancer. No action was taken with respect to 
study drug administration.  
The event of breast cancer was considered by the Investigator to be unlikely related to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events in UX023-CL203 
Subject: Angioedema 
A treatment-related serious, life-threatening event of angioedema was reported in a subject enrolled in 
Study UX023-CL203. The subject’s concomitant medications included lisinopril. The subject commenced 
treatment with subcutaneous burosumab every 4 weeks. On Study Day 392, the subject experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 108/151 
 
 
  
  
 
symptoms of throat tightening and swollen face and tongue. The lisinopril was discontinued. Upon 
rechallenge with burosumab approximately 4 weeks after the event, the angioedema did not recur. 
The Investigator assessed the event as possibly related to both burosumab and lisinopril. As the case was 
heavily confounded by co-suspect ACE inhibitor and the subject continued on study medication without 
rechallenge hypersensitivity reactions, the MAH considered the event related to lisinopril and unrelated to 
burosumab. 
Subject: Lung Adenocarcinoma 
Lung adenocarcinoma was reported in a subject. The subject never used tobacco or smokeless tobacco; 
however, family history was significant for lung cancer in a parent.  
During the study screening period, the subject was found to have a possible left lung nodule on their 
anteroposterior chest x-ray. The subject commenced study treatment with subcutaneous burosumab. 
After a comprehensive work-up, the nodule was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. No action was taken with 
study drug in response to the event and treatment with burosumab remained ongoing.  
The Investigator assessed the event as CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) and not related to the study drug. The 
MAH assessed the event as not related to burosumab. 
Subject: Chordoma 
A subject  experienced an SAE of “chordoma”. On Study Day 673, a renal ultrasound showed a right 
parenchymal mass and a left partially exophytic mass. On Study Day 689, CT of abdomen and pelvis 
revealed a large mass arising from sacrum containing chondroid matrix; and a right renal mass and a left 
renal mass. On Study Day 718, biopsy result revealed chordoma.  The Investigator explained that 
chordoma is a rare type of cancerous tumour that can occur anywhere along the spine. No action was 
taken with burosumab in the management of the event, and the treatment was ongoing. 
Investigator assessed the event of chordoma as CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) and unrelated to burosumab. 
Cancer was considered as alternate aetiology.  
Subject: Adenocarcinoma of Colon 
One subject, who experienced a serious TEAE of adenocarcinoma of the colon, 540 days after their first 
dose of burosumab. The subject's family history included parents and grandparents with cancer; and 
positive family history of genetic mutations for BRCA2, MSH2 as well as others. Genetic analysis of the 
subject showed variant of unknown clinical significance in MSH-2 gene. No action was taken with 
burosumab in the management of the event. 
The event was assessed by the Investigator as CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) in severity and unlikely related to 
study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events in UX023-CL303 
Subject (Placebo→burosumab): Presyncope (complex partial epilepsy) 
One subject, experienced a serious TEAE of Presyncope (verbatim: complex partial epilepsy) beginning on 
Study Day 179, 13 days after their first dose of burosumab. The subject was hospitalised and was 
diagnosed with complex partial epilepsy. Medical history included seizure whilst eclamptic during 
pregnancy. The subject was prescribed multiple medications that could have played contributory roles for 
the reported event of partial seizures.  
The event was assessed by the Investigator as mild (Grade 1) in severity and probably not related to 
study drug. Although seizure episodes continued, there was no disruption of study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

The subject was hospitalised again at Study Day 468 (after data cut-off), The subject had been 
experiencing symptoms for over a year. These spells were recorded as near syncope, severe weakness 
and complex partial epilepsy. The treating physicians could not agree on aetiology of the symptoms. No 
action was taken with study drug in the management of the event, and the treatment was ongoing. 
Confounders in diagnosis and concomitant medication. 
Subject (Burosumab→burosumab): Spinal column stenosis and Myelopathy 
A subject experienced SAEs of Spinal column stenosis and Myelopathy (verbatim terms: “worsening spinal 
stenosis”, “acute myelopathy”). In addition to XLH, the subject’s medical history included: multilevel 
spinal stenosis, laminectomy ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and hypertension. On 
Study Day 170, during the Week 24 visit 6-minute walk test, the subject first noted that they were 
weaker than had been previously. Over the following weeks the symptoms worsened. On Study Day 218, 
a new MRI showed multiple pathologies. The subject was subsequently subjected to surgery. No action 
was taken with burosumab in the management of the events, and the treatment was ongoing. 
The Investigator assessed the events of worsening spinal stenosis and acute myelopathy as important 
medical events resulting in hospitalisation, the event of worsening spinal stenosis as CTCAE Grade 3 
(severe) and the event of acute myelopathy as CTCAE Grade 2 (moderate). Both events were assessed as 
unlikely related to the blinded study drug, but instead to the subject's pre-existing multilevel spinal 
stenosis related to XLH. 
After data cut-off, the subject presented with restenosis. The Investigator considered that the cadence of 
the restenosis the subject experienced was more rapid than if it occurred as a result of baseline disease. 
Since the subject had a rapid restenosis twice while on study medication, the Investigator considered the 
event might have been possibly related to the study medication administration. 
Other Significant Adverse Events: Injection Site Reactions (ISR) 
The subject incidence of ISRs across all paediatric studies was 58.5% with an exposure adjusted event 
incidence/year of 1.987. 
The incidence of ISRs in the adult studies are given in Table 43.  
Table 41: Treatment-emergent Injection Site Reactions – Study UX023-CL303 and Overall Repeat-dose 
Studies in Adult XLH 
 a: The total burosumab column under UX023-CL303 includes all subjects who ever received any dose of burosumab in Study UX023-CL303. The 
length of burosumab treatment varies as it includes both subjects randomised to receive burosumab from baseline and subjects randomised to placebo 
who crossed over to receive burosumab at Week 24. 
 b: The overall burosumab group includes all subjects that have received burosumab in the adult repeat-dose XLH studies, including Study UX023-
CL303 subjects randomised to placebo once they crossed over to burosumab. The unique number of subjects in this group is 175; however, 1 subject 
who enrolled in both KRN23-INT-001 and UX023-CL303 was analysed as 2 different subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 110/151 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Across all adult studies, the subject incidence of ISRs was 25% and the exposure-adjusted event 
incidence was 0.796 events/year. Overall, most ISRs were Grade 1 (86%), occurred within 1 day of drug 
administration (93%), lasted about 1 to 3 days, and resolved as of the data cut-off dates (99%). 
Other Significant Adverse Events: Hypersensitivity 
Across all paediatric studies, the methodology of using the narrow “Hypersensitivity” SMQ identified 28 
paediatric subjects (43%) with 56 TEAE PTs that could indicate a possible hypersensitivity reaction. 
Hypersensitivity TEAEs were considered to be at least possibly related to treatment for 8 subjects (12%). 
The most frequent treatment-related hypersensitivity TEAEs were injection site rash (6.2%), rash (3.1%) 
and urticaria (3.1%). 
Across all repeat-dose adult studies, 55 hypersensitivity TEAEs were reported for 33 (18.8%) subjects 
(Table 44). One subject in Study UX023-CL203 reported 1 serious, Grade 4 (life-threatening) event of 
angioedema discussed above.  
Table 42: Treatment-emergent Hypersensitivity Adverse Events – Study UX023-CL303 and Overall 
Repeat-dose Studies in Adult XLH 
For footnotes, please refer to Table 43 
Because the narrow SMQ for “hypersensitivity” is a relatively wide search criteria, another targeted 
search was conducted for severe hypersensitivity events using PTs in narrow SMQs ‘Severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions’, ‘Anaphylactic reaction’, and ‘Angioedema’.  
This search yielded 9 subjects who reported 10 TEAEs: urticaria (3 subjects [1.7%]), gingival swelling (2 
subjects [1.1%]), swelling face (2 subjects [1.1%]), angioedema (1 subject [0.6%]), and swollen tongue 
(1 subject [0.6%]).  
Narratives were presented for these events, however, not included in the AR for the sake of conciseness. 
The Investigators assessed all events except angioedema as unrelated to study treatment and burosumab 
was not withdrawn in any of the cases.  
Other Significant Adverse Events: Hyperphosphataemia 
No TEAEs of hyperphosphataemia (i.e., a serum phosphorus above the upper limit of normal [ULN] for 
age) or blood phosphorus increased were identified in any of the paediatric subjects.  
In adult studies, eight subjects reported nine events of hyperphosphataemia (>4.5 mg/dL), all in Study 
UX023-CL303 (Table 45). Most hyperphosphataemia TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as mild

hyperphosphataemia required protocol-specified dose reductions. For 4/5 subjects, reduction from 1.0 to 
0.5 mg/kg was sufficient. However, in one of the subjects an additional dose reduction to 0.25 mg/kg was 
required.

Other Significant Adverse Events: Ectopic Mineralisation 
In Study UX023-CL303, through the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period (Week 24), there were no 
TEAEs associated with ectopic mineralisation. The overall Ectopic Mineralization TEAEs are summarised in 
Table 46.  
Table 44: Treatment-emergent Ectopic Mineralisation Adverse Events – Study UX023-CL303 and Overall 
Repeat-dose Studies in Adult XLH 
a: The total burosumab column under UX023-CL303 includes all subjects who ever received any dose of burosumab in Study UX023-CL303. The 
length of burosumab treatment varies as it includes both subjects randomised to receive burosumab from baseline and subjects randomised to placebo 
who crossed over to receive burosumab at Week 24. b: The overall burosumab group includes all subjects that have received burosumab in the adult 
repeat-dose XLH studies, including Study UX023-CL303 subjects randomised to placebo once they crossed over to burosumab. The unique number 
of subjects in this group is 175; however, 1 subject who enrolled in both KRN23-INT-001 and UX023-CL303 was analysed as 2 different subjects.. c: 
Based on renal ultrasound observations at Week 24, 3 subjects reported TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis on the same day that they received their first dose 
of burosumab.  d: Based on renal ultrasound observations at Week 24, 1 subject reported a TEAE of nephrolithiasis on the same day that the subject 
received their first dose of burosumab 
Through the data cut-off date, 9 subjects (6.7%) experienced TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis (6 subjects) or 
nephrolithiasis (3 subjects). The exposure-adjusted event incidence in the total burosumab group was 
0.08 events/year.  
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 112/151 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
These events were noted at the Weeks 24 and 48 visits and were based on renal ultrasound assessments. 
At Week 24, TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis were reported for 4 subjects (placebo group: 3; burosumab 
group: 1), and TEAEs of nephrolithiasis were reported for 3 subjects (placebo group: 1; burosumab 
group: 2).  
At Week 48, TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis were reported for 2 subjects (1 subject each in the 
placebo→burosumab and burosumab→burosumab groups). 
In the 4 subjects in the placebo group, the TEAEs of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis occurred on the 
same day as the first dose of open-label burosumab at Week 24 and are therefore considered 
burosumab-emergent. While 3 of these 4 events were considered treatment-related by the investigator, a 
causal association to burosumab was highly unlikely given exposure of less than 1 day. 
One subject in Study KRN23-INT-002 experienced Grade 2 nephrolithiasis, which was considered related 
to treatment by the Investigator. However, the event was confounded by the subject’s pre-existing 
nephrocalcinosis and history of nephrolithiasis.  
In Study UX023-CL203, most subjects had no nephrocalcinosis on renal ultrasound at baseline (75.0%) 
or at Week 48 (80.0%) of burosumab treatment. One (5.0%) subject had Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at 
baseline and no nephrocalcinosis at Week 48, 1 (5.0%) subject had Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at both 
visits, 2 (10.0%) subjects had Grade 2 nephrocalcinosis at both visits, and 1 (5.0%) subject had a 
nonreadable renal ultrasound at baseline and Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at Week 48 of burosumab 
treatment.  
No subjects in Study UX023-CL304 had an ectopic mineralisation TEAE. 
Nephrocalcinosis detected by renal ultrasound was scored using a 5-point scale in which 0 = normal and 
4 = stone formation. Renal ultrasound scores were assessed by the last available value on study because 
it better reflects variability of clinical ultrasound readings and also captures those subjects who had 
unchanged scores at initial assessments but subsequently had decreases in scores on study. 
No subjects had changes of more than 1 point in Study UX023-CL303 (Table 47).

Table 45:  Shifts in Nephrocalcinosis Scores to Last Post-baseline Grade by Renal Ultrasound In Study 
UX023-CL303 (Safety Analysis Set) 
a: The total burosumab column under UX023-CL303 includes all subjects who ever received any dose of burosumab in Study UX023-CL303. The 
length of burosumab treatment varies as it includes both subjects randomised to receive burosumab from baseline and subjects randomised to placebo 
who crossed over to receive burosumab at Week 24. 
Renal ultrasound scores in Studies UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 showed a similar pattern. Scores 
were unchanged from baseline to the last available assessment for 18/20 subjects (90%) in Study 
UX023-CL203 and 12/14 subjects (85.7%) in Study UX023-CL304.  
For subjects with changes in renal ultrasound scores during treatment, increases or decreases in scores 
were 1 point; no subjects had changes of more than 1 point. The maximum last post-baseline score was 
3 in 2 subjects: a +1 shift for 1 subject (baseline score of 2), and unchanged for 1 subject (baseline score 
of 3). 
In Study UX023-CL303, cardiac echogram (ECHO) was also performed to evaluate for potential changes 
in cardiac ectopic mineralisation or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Ectopic mineralisation was scored 
with a semi-quantitative echocardiographic calcium score (eCS) (Gaibazzi et al, 2014). The majority of 
subjects (88.8%) entered the study with no evidence of ectopic mineralisation (ie, eCS = 0); most 
(79.1%) maintained an eCS of 0 at Week 24 and at Week 48 (83.6%) (Table 48).

Analysis Set - Week 48 Analysis 
A subject in Study UX023-CL304 experienced a TEAE of ejection fraction (EF) decreased at Week 48. The 
subject had an ejection fraction of 77.1% at baseline, 77.4% at Week 24, and 65.7% at Week 48. 
Although an ejection fraction of 65% is within normal limits, the Investigator considered the decreased EF 
as a TEAE. The reading cardiologist noted no significant change from the prior ECHO. The event was mild 
in severity and considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. The event was not resolved as of 
the data cut-off date. 
Other Significant Adverse Events: Restless legs (RLS) 
The exact mechanism of RLS in XLH subjects treated with burosumab is not known. It is hypothesised 
that increasing serum phosphorus levels near/into the normal range in subjects that have been 
chronically and severely hypophosphataemic may precipitate RLS symptoms/severity. Studies in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) patients, who have a high frequency of RLS, have shown that higher serum 
phosphorus levels are strongly associated with RLS and that lowering serum phosphorus through dialysis 
will immediately reduce or eliminate RLS symptoms. 
RLS has not been observed in subjects in the paediatric studies. 
A total of 4 (3%) subjects (2 in each treatment group) entered the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, 
UX023-CL303, with a documented medical history of RLS. Two of these subjects (1 in each treatment 
group) experienced worsening RLS reported as a TEAE. Subject-level details of RLS events in adult 
studies are provided in the table below.

For footnotes, please refer to Table 43 
One subject, in Study KRN23-INT-002, experienced a TEAE of worsening RLS, Grade 3 in severity, which 
led to discontinuation from the study. The RLS resolved/returned to baseline level after discontinuing 
burosumab. This subject subsequently enrolled in Study UX023-CL203 and had not reported RLS after 
more than 48 weeks of treatment. 
Other Significant Adverse Events: Anti-burosumab Antibodies 
Summary of Immunogenicity in Paediatric Subjects  
In total, of the 94 subjects who were treated with burosumab, 86 (91.5%) subjects were ADA negative 
(79 subjects negative at all timepoints; 7 baseline positive subjects who did not have a boosted ADA 
response) and 8 (8.5%) subjects were ADA positive. There were 3 (3.2%) paediatric subjects who were 
considered to be positive for neutralising antibodies (Nab). 
Immunogenicity Results in Adults: Study UX023-CL303 
Before initiation of burosumab treatment in Study UX023-CL303, the majority of subjects were negative 
for ADA (114/134; 85.1%).

Table 48: ADA Results in Adult Subjects with XLH (Study UX023-CL303) 
ADA = antidrug antibody; n = number of subjects who tested positive or negative for anti-drug antibodies; N = total number of subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of Investigational Product (burosumab or placebo); XLH = X-linked hypophosphatemia. a: Subjects randomised to placebo crossed 
over to burosumab treatment at Week 24; all subjects received open-label burosumab after Week 24. Samples for assessment of ADA were drawn 
before the dose of burosumab for the visit. 
Eight subjects who were negative at baseline were positive for ADA (titre ≥2) at least 1 visit after 
initiation of burosumab treatment (i.e., treatment-induced ADAs). These subjects had transient immune 
responses, with ADA-positive samples at only 1 or 2 post-treatment time points.  
Of the 20 subjects positive for ADA before initiation of burosumab treatment, 7 were negative for ADA 
after initiation of burosumab treatment, and 13 were positive for ADA at ≥1 visit after initiation of 
burosumab treatment; all of the 13 subjects showed decreased or unchanged titre post-treatment, i.e., 
treatment did not boost ADA response.   
All samples positive for ADA in the improved assay were tested in the NAb assay. All NAb results in Study 
UX023-CL303 were negative, i.e., no neutralising activity was detected.   
Immunogenicity Results in Adults: Study UX023-CL304 
In study UX023-304, of the 14 subjects treated with burosumab in study, 4 subjects (28.6%) had ADA 
positive samples at baseline, while 10 (71.4%) subjects were ADA negative.  
The 10 subjects, who were ADA negative at baseline, remained ADA negative throughout the study. Of 
the 4 subjects who had ADA positive samples at baseline, 2 subjects did not have ADA positive samples 
detected post-baseline, while 2 subjects had samples that were not confirmed to be ADA positive. 
Therefore, none of the 14 subjects were determined to be ADA positive during the study. 
Impact on Immunogenicity on Efficacy in Adult Subjects (Study UX023-CL303)  
The potential impact of ADA on efficacy in adults with XLH was assessed by a review of changes in serum 
phosphorus concentrations for the 28 subjects positive for ADA at any point in Study UX023-CL303 (Table 
51).

group continued to receive burosumab after Week 24 (placebo → burosumab). All subjects received open-label burosumab after Week 24. 
Impact on Immunogenicity on Safety in Adult Subjects (Study UX023-CL303) 
Of the 28 subjects positive for ADA at Baseline or any postbaseline visit in Study UX023-CL303:  
• 
• 
Twenty subjects did not have burosumab-emergent ISRs or AEs of hypersensitivity 
Five subjects had burosumab-emergent ISRs: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Injection site pruritus 
Injection site pruritus, Injection site erythema 
Injection site reaction, Injection site erythema 
Injection site erythema 
Injection site reaction, Injection site pruritus 
All ISRs for these subjects were non-serious, mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity 
and resolved on study. All were considered by the Investigators to be related to burosumab. None 
of these ISRs resulted in change to the burosumab dose or discontinuation from study.  
•  One subject had a burosumab-emergent AE of hypersensitivity. The subject had a non-serious 
event of mild (Grade 1) contact dermatitis that was considered by the Investigator to be possibly 
related to burosumab. The event resolved on study, did not result in a change to the burosumab 
dose or discontinuation from study. 
• 
Two subjects each had an event of injection site hypersensitivity. These events were non-serious, 
mild (Grade 1) in severity, resolved on study and were considered by the Investigators to be

related to burosumab. Neither of these ISRs resulted in change to the burosumab dose or 
discontinuation from study.  
In addition, these subjects had other AEs of hypersensitivity: rash (2 events) for one subject, and 
hypersensitivity and eczema (2 events) for another subject. These events were non-serious, mild 
(Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity, did not result in a change to the burosumab dose or 
discontinuation from study. These events were considered by the Investigators to be not related 
to burosumab except for1 event of rash that was considered possibly related. These AEs of 
hypersensitivity resolved on study, except for an event of eczema that was resolving at end of 
study. 
Events of ISRs and/or hypersensitivity were not necessarily coincident with the timing of samples testing 
positive for ADA, and no correlation between the occurrence of ISR, hypersensitivity AEs, and ADA was 
evident. Overall, ISRs and hypersensitivity-like reactions in subjects positive for ADA at Baseline or any 
post-baseline visit were non-serious, mild-to-moderate in severity, and resolved on study (with exception 
of 1 event that was reversing). The safety and benefit-risk profiles for these subjects were similar to 
those of subjects negative for ADA. These results suggest that immunogenicity, i.e., the presence of anti-
burosumab antibodies, does not impact the safety of burosumab in adults with XLH. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, analysis of laboratory data (serum phosphorus, iPTH, serum calcium, eGFR, serum creatinine or 
BUN and serum amylase) did not reveal any clinically meaningful safety concerns in the paediatric 
studies. Results from the adult studies are summarised below.  
Serum Phosphorus 
Hyperphosphataemia, as defined by a serum phosphorus level above the ULN (4.5 mg/dL; 1.5 mmol/L), 
has been observed in repeat-dose adult studies. The observed serum phosphorus levels in these studies 
were below the dose limiting toxicity threshold of 6.5 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L). 
Events of high serum phosphorus in UX023-CL303 is summarised in Table 52.

Analysis Set)

“LOW” denotes values below reference range (< 2.5 mg/dL); for placebo subjects crossing over to burosumab after Placebo-controlled Treatment 
Period, Week 24 data are provided. If serum phosphorus >5.0 mg/dL at any time, unblind and dose reduce by half. If serum phosphorous >ULN (4.5 
mg/dL) but ≤5.0 mg/dL, unblind and reduce dose by half if a second phosphorus result >ULN. “+” denotes continued dosing past cut-off date. The 
dose was reduced to 0.25 mg/kg at Weeks 20 and 24; however, the data entry system only allowed for recording of 2 digits. The dose was therefore 
recorded as 0.3 mg/kg. To be compliant with dose rounding rules, the dose was subsequently modified to 0.2 mg/kg at Week 28 
In Study UX023-CL203, one subject (5%) had one serum phosphorus level above ULN. The dose was 
reduced but the event not reported as a TEAE. 
Assessment report

No subjects in Studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002 or UX023-CL304 had elevations in serum 
phosphorus above ULN. 
Overall, serum phosphorus elevations above ULN occurred in 18/176 (10.2%) adult subjects during 
burosumab treatment. 
Intact Parathyroid Hormone 
To be eligible for Study UX023-CL303, iPTH could not exceed ≥2.5 ULN. The mean iPTH concentration 
was above the ULN (>72 pg/mL) in both treatment groups at baseline. The mean ([standard error] SE) 
iPTH concentration was 98.9 (7.60) pg/mL (range: 23-447) in the burosumab group and 95.2 (4.89) 
pg/mL (range: 29-242) in the placebo group. The difference between groups (burosumab and placebo) in 
change from baseline to Week 24 was statistically significant (p = 0.0012). 
Figure 34: iPTH (pg/mL) (Mean ±SE) and Change from Baseline (LS Mean ±SE): Study UX023-CL303 in 
Adult XLH (Safety Analysis Set)  
Placebo subjects cross over to burosumab treatment at Week 24, and all subjects receive open-label burosumab after Week 24 in the Treatment 
Continuation Period. 
Overall in the adult clinical development program, the subject incidence of TEAEs of increased serum iPTH 
in burosumab-treated adult subjects was 4.0%. 
Considering the potential for hyperparathyroidism in subjects with XLH, the applicant was asked during 
the procedure to summarise all cases of hyperparathyroidism that have occurred in XLH subjects on 
burosumab treatment from the clinical development programme and post-marketing data in both adult 
and paediatric populations, including their relevant concomitant laboratory measurements and any clinical 
consequences. On review of the responses, there was 1 out of 116 paediatric patients with an AE of blood 
PTH increased and seventeen out of 176 adult subjects (9.7%) in the repeat dose burosumab XLH studies 
reported at least one adverse event of blood parathyroid hormone increased or hyperparathyroidism or 
hyperparathyroidism secondary. In the adult population, among the clinical trial cases, 11 out of the 15 
adult subjects had elevated iPTH at study baseline and 1 paediatric subject had raised iPTH at screening 
visit. The majority of the TEAEs were related to transient or intermittent increases in parathyroid 
hormone levels above baseline values but were not accompanied by any clinically relevant changes in 
serumcalcium values or clinical signs and symptoms. No action was taken with the study medication as a 
result of the TEAEs.

Serum Calcium 
In Study UX023-CL303, individuals with elevated serum calcium levels (≥10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L]) were 
excluded from the study.  
At baseline and throughout the study, serum calcium levels generally remained within the normal 
reference range (8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.1-2.5 mmol/L]). Changes from baseline are graphically presented in 
Figure 36.

Analysis Set) 
Placebo subjects cross over to burosumab treatment at Week 24, and all subjects receive open-label burosumab after Week 24 in the Treatment 
Continuation Period. 
TEAEs associated with decreased blood calcium were reported in 3 subjects in Study UX023-CL303 
through the data cut-off date. Two of these events occurred during the Placebo-controlled Treatment 
Period, and included one subject in the burosumab group (serum calcium: 7.8 mg/dL [1.9 mmol/L]; 
event assessed as possibly related to study drug), and one subject in the placebo group, although the 
serum calcium levels in this subject were within the normal range (serum calcium: 8.7 mg/dL [2.2 
mmol/L] [range: 8.6 – 10.2 mg/dL]; event assessed as probably not related to study drug). Study 
treatment was not disrupted in either subject. One subject had a TEAE of hypocalcaemia at Week 46 
(serum calcium: 7.4 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L]; event assessed as not related to study drug) which resolved 
after 16 days without treatment. The subject chose to discontinue after the Treatment Continuation 
period; the subject’s last dose of burosumab was at Week 44, and the subject’s last visit was Week 48.  
No TEAEs associated with increased blood calcium were reported through the data cut-off date. 
Clinically meaningful changes in serum or urinary calcium were also not seen in Studies KRN23-INT-001 
and KRN23-INT-002. In Study UX023-CL203, 1 subject reported a TEAE of hypercalciuria at Week 24, 
which was mild in severity and did not result in a change in burosumab treatment. The subject had had 
stable Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at both Baseline and Week 24 and no nephrolithiasis. 
Renal Function Laboratory Assessments 
To be eligible for Study UX023-CL303, subjects were required to have an eGFR of ≥60 mL/min (or 45 to 
< 60 mL/min with confirmation that the renal insufficiency was not due to nephrocalcinosis).

Mean and median eGFR values for baseline, Week 24 and Week 48 in Study UX023-CL303 are 
summarised in Table 53. 
Table 51: Summary of eGFR UX023-CL303 Adult XLH Safety Analysis Set Week 48 Analysis (compiled from 
CSR by Assessor) 
One subject experienced a TEAE of decreased eGFR through the data cut-off date. The event occurred 
during the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period, was assessed as possibly related to study drug by the 
Investigator and did not disrupt study treatment. 
A total of 8 adult subjects in Studies UX023-CL303, UX023-CL304 and UX023-CL203 with normal baseline 
serum creatinine results experienced a transient elevation in serum creatinine with subsequent normal 
values: 2 subjects enrolled in Study UX023-CL203 and 6 subjects enrolled in Study UX023-CL303 (4 
while receiving burosumab; 2 while receiving placebo). Concurrent serum BUN levels were normal in 2 
subjects receiving burosumab and mildly elevated in 6 subjects (2 placebo and 4 burosumab). These mild 
BUN elevations ranged from 24 to 32 mg/dL (reference range: 9-23 mg/dL) in subjects whose serum 
creatinine elevations were less than 1.1 × ULN and suggest mild dehydration as these were fasting blood 
samples. There were no TEAEs associated with serum creatinine levels through the data cut-off date. 
One subject in the placebo arm experienced a TEAE of decreased eGFR through the data cut-off date. The 
event occurred at Week 12 during the double-blind period.  
Serum Amylase 
Several subjects entered Study UX023-CL303 with modest (Grade 1: 9% or Grade 2: 0.7%) serum 
amylase elevation. This has been observed previously in individuals with XLH in the burosumab 
development programme, without any apparent clinical consequences.

One subject (placebo) entered the study with an abnormal ECG considered potentially clinically relevant; 
the subject’s medical history included heart palpitations due to or caused by Wolff-Parkinson-White 
Syndrome. Following radiofrequency heart ablation on Study Day 332, this subject’s ECG showed normal 
sinus rhythm at Week 48. Another subject (placebo) had an abnormal ECG interpreted as potentially 
clinically relevant at Week 24; no cardiac TEAEs were reported for this subject through the data cut-off 
date. 
Heart rate and blood pressure 
Clinically relevant changes in vital signs were reported as TEAEs.  
Through the data cut-off date across all adult repeat-dose studies, increased blood pressure or 
hypertension was reported in 13 subjects, 3 while receiving placebo and 10 while receiving burosumab. 
None of the events were considered serious or attributed to study drug. Of the 10 subjects receiving 
burosumab, 2 subjects had a documented history of hypertension. No trends in blood pressure or heart 
rate were observed; subjects were just as likely to have elevations in blood pressure or heart rate on 3 
consecutive visits as they were to have decreases in these measurements across all adult studies (Table 
56). 
Table 54: Summary of Vital Signs Outliers: Repeat-dose Studies in Adult XLH 
Weight and height 
There has been interest in the role that FGF23 and hypophosphataemia play in fat deposition and body 
weight in patients with XLH. The high incidence of above normal BMI has been seen in children with XLH 
and the incidence increases with age (Zhoukouskaya et al, 2019). It has been proposed that altered 
thermogenesis as a result of low phosphate affecting ATP availability and central control of satiety may be 
a contributory factor. Although there are no long-term data yet that show an effect of burosumab on BMI

or fat metabolism, the correction of serum phosphate and improved exercise tolerance are an additional 
benefit in this complex disease. 
Study UX023-CL303 (approximately 40% of subjects were ≤35 years) showed that subjects had 
significant comorbidities at study entry (e.g., obesity and hypertension), which are likely associated with 
the impact of XLH on mobility and physical function and could be prevented or alleviated by continued 
burosumab treatment from the adolescent years to adulthood. For instance, 75% of subjects (100/134) 
in Study UX023-CL303 were classified as either overweight, obese or severely obese at study entry, 
which is likely related to the impact of XLH on their ability to participate in physical activities. 
Other Observations Related to Safety: Spinal Surgery 
Spinal stenosis, which often can progress to significant spinal cord compression, is a well-described 
phenomenon in patients with XLH (Soehle, 2002). 
At least 30 patients with XLH (including some with vitamin D-resistant hypophosphataemia prior to the 
discovery of the molecular genetic basis of XLH) have been described in the literature to have cord 
compression (Soehle, 2002), (Velan, 2001), (Kawaguchi, 2009), (Xie, 2014), (Shiba, 2015), (Watts, 
2015), (Riccio, 2016), (Chesher, 2018). Spinal stenosis occurs at multiple anatomical levels of the spine 
in XLH and due to multifactorial causes, making it challenging to unify into a common pathophysiology. A 
subset of cases can be associated with ossification of either the posterior longitudinal ligament or the 
ligamentum flavum. Additionally, whether it can be associated with conventional therapy with phosphate 
and active vitamin D metabolites/analogues is unclear, as some cases in the literature occurred with no 
therapy or minimal therapy, implying that it may be secondary to the XLH disease process itself.   
In Study UX023-CL303, a total of 27 subjects (20.1%) had a medical history at baseline of either spinal 
stenosis, cord compression, or another event term likely to be related to either spinal stenosis or cord 
compression. 
Across all repeat-dose adult studies, a total of 6 subjects had spinal surgery, including 1 subject each 
from Studies KRN23-INT-001/KRN23-INT-002 and UX023-CL304, and 4 subjects from Study UX023-
CL303 (2 in the burosumab group and 1 each in the placebo→burosumab group and the placebo group).  
The 6 cases of spinal surgery with pre-existing stenosis (or a longstanding history of back pain) seem 
consistent with the natural history of the disease and with the cases reported in the medical literature 
(including assessment by age, anatomical region, and anatomical cause). The medical review of these 
cases demonstrated that for 3 of these cases there was either no evidence of clinical progression of spinal 
stenosis while on study (2 subjects) or alternatively that it began while the subject was on placebo (1 
subject). For 2 of these 3 cases, surgery had also either been pre-planned or previously discussed. One 
subject had an extensive history of prior spinal surgery and one subject had an extensive history of back 
issues, including back surgery and one subject had a longstanding history of back pain. 
The MAH concludes that given the relatively frequent occurrence of spinal stenosis and cord compression 
in XLH, the difficulty in unifying the different anatomical causes of spinal stenosis in XLH (and in these 
individual cases) into a common pathophysiology, and the medical review findings of these cases, the 
data suggest that the number of spinal surgery cases seen in the study are not unexpected and are 
unlikely to be related to burosumab treatment. Burosumab’s mechanism of action and the lack of 
meaningful changes of measures of ectopic mineralisation suggest that burosumab is unlikely to have 
worsened the condition of spinal stenosis, and that, most likely, the sequelae experienced by these 
subjects were natural progression of the condition itself.

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
As safety data in subjects >65 years of age were limited (no subject >66 years of age was included in the 
studies), no meaningful conclusions can be drawn for this population.  
Review of safety data by sex in both paediatric and adult subjects revealed no meaningful differences.  
As burosumab dose is calculated on a mg/kg basis, a subject’s weight should not be a factor; a minimum 
dose of 10 mg and a maximum dose of 90 mg, regardless of weight, is proposed in the product 
information.   
Data were limited in a number of intrinsic factors such as race and baseline history of hepatic/renal 
impairment. As the preponderance of the subjects were white/Caucasian, meaningful conclusions by 
race/ethnicity could not be drawn. Subjects with a history of liver impairment were not excluded from 
burosumab clinical trials; however, the data on the effect of burosumab in subjects with liver impairment 
are also limited. Subjects with severe kidney impairment were excluded from clinical trials, as they could 
be prone to increases in serum phosphorus and calcium; as such, data on the effect of burosumab in 
subjects with renal impairment are limited. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation  
Currently, very limited data are available for the use of burosumab in pregnant women.   
Through the data cut-off date, 3 pregnancies have been reported in 3 female subjects enrolled in clinical 
studies with burosumab. In addition, a pregnancy was reported in the partner of a male subject. All 4 
women delivered healthy infants at term. Short summaries of the cases are given below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In the first case, the woman had a positive pregnancy test 54 days post last dose of burosumab. 
No further burosumab was given during pregnancy. To episodes of spotting/cramping were 
reported during pregnancy.  
In the second case, conception date was approximated to Study Day 422. The last dose of study 
drug was received on Study Day 423, and subsequently, study treatment was discontinued as per 
protocol. No complications were reported. 
In the third case, conception date was approximated to Study Day 326. The last dose of study 
drug was received on Study Day 336. On Study Day 345, urine pregnancy test was positive and 
subsequently, study treatment was discontinued as per protocol. No complications were reported.  
In the fourth case, the father received the most recent dose of burosumab (90 mg) prior to his 
partner becoming pregnant at Study Week 68. No information was given on the approximate day 
of conception in relation to this dose. Induction of labour was planned due to suspected 
macrosomia. Dilation arrested at 7 cm, and the mother underwent a primary low transverse 
caesarean delivery 6 days before the expected due date. 
Adolescents 
Phase 2 Study UX023-CL201 recruited children up to the age of 12 years and patients were recruited at 
the upper end of the age inclusion criteria. Study UX023-CL201 followed subjects for up to 160 weeks; 
these final safety data are available and are included in this variation. Specifically, 11 subjects (all 
female) were identified whose growth plates closed during the course of the study. For one of the eleven 
subjects, the last reading with open growth plates was the Week 64 reading. The remaining ten subjects 
had open growth plates at the Week 88 reading. The mean age of these subjects was 9.8 years on study 
entry (range 8-11 years) and all subjects had received previous treatment with oral phosphate and 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 129/151 
 
 
  
  
vitamin D (mean duration of treatment 8 years). At Week 160, the mean burosumab dose was 1.06 
mg/kg (range 0.5-1.8 mg/kg) Q2W. All subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE and 8 experienced related 
TEAEs; all reported TEAEs were non-serious. Review of the individual safety data for these subjects and 
the summarised data did not reveal any differences in their safety profile compared to the overall study 
population. In particular, there was no suggestion that longer term treatment resulted in more frequent 
AEs or of AEs of a different nature.  
Currently, burosumab is approved in the EU for the treatment of all children up to the age of 18 years, 
except those without “growing skeletons”. Burosumab has been commercially available in the US since 17 
Apr 2018 for the treatment of children with XLH aged 1 year and older. Over this time, there have been 
no safety signals that would raise concern over treating adolescents who have reached maximum vertical 
height and/or with closed long bone growth plates. In addition, a small group of adolescent patients (N = 
132) have been started burosumab treatment in a UK, through an expanded access programme, with no 
reports of treatment being poorly tolerated or stopping (Dharmaraj et al, 2019).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted with burosumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Three subjects in the adult development program discontinued study drug because of a TEAE; one in 
Study KRN23-INT-001 and two in Study KRN23-INT-002. Two of the subjects later entered extension 
study UX023-CL203: 
•  A subject in KRN23-INT-001 experienced a TEAE of injection site urticaria on Study Day 57. The 
subject was discontinued from the study due to the event. The Investigator considered the event 
to be moderate in intensity and probably related to study drug. 
•  A subject with a medical history of nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis experienced a TEAE of 
haematuria with painful urination on Study Day 4. Study medication was discontinued after the 
first dose due to the events of haematuria, painful urination, and kidney stones. All three TEAEs 
were considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to the study drug. The subject 
subsequently enrolled in Study UX023-CL203 approximately 3 years later. Forty-two weeks after 
initiating treatment on this study, the subject experienced a TEAE of nephrolithiasis. The event 
was mild in severity and deemed unrelated to study treatment by the Investigator. Burosumab 
was not changed in response to the event and subject remains on study as of the data cut-off 
date. 
•  A subject with a medical history of RLS experienced an AE of moderate increase in RLS symptoms 
two weeks after their final dose of burosumab on Study KRN23-INT-001 and 43 days before 
KRN23-INT-002 Study Day 1. On Study Day 135, the subject experienced severe worsening of 
RLS with right arm involvement and the study drug was discontinued. The subject subsequently 
enrolled in Study UX023-CL203 approximately 2.5 years later. The subject did not report a 
recurrence of worsening of RLS after more than 48 weeks of treatment and remains on the study. 
Post-marketing experience 
Data presented in the most recent PSUR submitted in the EU for burosumab showed that cumulatively up 
to 31 Jan 2019, a total of 1,224 patients have been exposed to commercially available burosumab or in 
early access programmes. A review of the collated post-marketing safety data did not show any changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 130/151 
 
 
  
  
in the benefit-risk profile of burosumab. Overall, the reported AEs were either expected adverse drug 
reactions for burosumab or were due to the patients’ underlying medical condition under treatment.   
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The adult safety database comprises of 176 subjects having received at least one dose of burosumab in 
studies KRN23-INT-001/KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL203, UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304. The total 
cumulative exposure is 205 patient-years and the mean duration of exposure was 61 weeks.  
96-100% of the subjects in the five studies were reported with a treatment emergent adverse event 
(TEAE), of which 55-64% were deemed as related to burosumab.  
The rates of reported TEAEs were comparable in both treatment arms during the placebo-controlled 
period of UX023-CL303 (94% in the burosumab arm and 92% in the placebo arm), whereas somewhat 
more TEAEs were deemed as treatment related in the burosumab arm (44% vs 39%). Two subjects (3%) 
in each treatment arm were reported with an SAE. No SAE was deemed as related to the study drug in 
UX023-CL303.  
TEAEs were generally less common in adults than in the paediatric population and the distribution of 
TEAEs between SOCs differed between the adult and paediatric population, but no new and unexpected 
TEAEs were reported in the adult population compared to the paediatric population. 
In the adult safety database, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs Infections and 
infestations (68%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (64%), Nervous system disorders 
(49%), General disorders and administration site conditions (48%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (46%).  
With some exceptions described below, the frequency of reported TEAEs in each SOC was balanced 
between the two treatment arms of study UX023-CL303. TEAEs more common in the burosumab arm 
included back pain (14% vs 6% for burosumab and placebo, respectively), Tooth abscess (13% vs 8%), 
restless legs (RLS; 12% vs 8%) Vitamin D decreased (12% vs 5%), dizziness (10% vs 6%), constipation 
(9% vs 0%), and investigation (21% vs 14%).  
Headache and tooth abscess/tooth infections were more common in the burosumab arm also in the 
paediatric active controlled open-label study UX23-CL301 (provided in procedure II/04). Both items are 
labelled ADRs for the paediatric population and are included in the PI also for the adult population; so is 
Vitamin-D decreased. In procedure II/04, the SmPC for the paediatric population was amended to include 
information regarding the fact that substitution with inactive vitamin D may be needed. The MAH has 
agreed that the same information should apply also for the adult population. Back pain is included in the 
PI for adults with XLH. RLS is assigned an AESI for Crysvita and is further discussed below. No individual 
Preferred Terms within the SOC Investigations had a frequency of ≥5%, i.e. approximately 3 subjects in 
either treatment arm. 
In summary, TEAEs were generally more common among children and the distribution of TEAEs between 
SOCs differed between the adult and paediatric population, but no new and unexpected TEAEs were 
reported in the adult population compared to the paediatric population. 
Subjects with severe kidney impairment were excluded from clinical trials, and the lowest baseline eGFR 
in Study UX023-CL303 was 67 ml/min/1.73 m2. Subjects with a history of liver impairment were not 
excluded from burosumab clinical trials; however, the data on the effect of burosumab in subjects with 
liver impairment are also limited. Upon request, the MAH has performed analyses on the subgroups of the 
population with impaired liver and kidney impairment.  
In the adult repeat dose XLH studies, 55 out of a total of 176 subjects (31.3%) were found to have either 
a history of hepatobiliary disorder of any kind (n=16) and/or impairment in liver function tests (any value 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 131/151 
 
 
  
  
above upper limit of the normal range) (n=44) at baseline (“liver cohort”). The most common 
hepatobiliary disorder was hepatic steatosis (n=7), followed by cholelithiasis (n=5) and cholecystitis 
(n=2). Due to a low number of events, direct comparisons to the total study population is difficult, but 
there were no new safety concerns identified in the 55 subjects in the liver cohort. All 55 subjects 
reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) compared to 173/176 (98%) in the 
overall burosumab population. A slightly higher number of subjects in the liver cohort reported a serious 
AE (SAE) (22% vs 16% in the overall population); however, none of these events in the liver cohort were 
considered related to burosumab. Of note, 8 of the 55 subjects (14%) in the liver cohort had TEAEs of 
abnormal liver function or hepatobiliary disorders, whilst 2 of 122 (2%) without liver impairment at 
baseline had TEAEs of abnormal liver function or hepatobiliary disorders. It is agreed with the Applicant 
that it is to be expected that any individual with underlying hepatic disorder or conditions predisposing to 
hepatic disease could be more likely to experience hepatic related events, in the absence of health 
intervention intended to treat existing hepatic function abnormalities. The Applicant should continue to 
monitor for hepatic related safety signals in burosumab treated patients as part of routine PV monitoring. 
Only 13 of the patients in Study UX023-CL303 had an eGFR <90mL/min/1.7m2, all with an eGFR 
>60mL/min/1.7m2, i.e. CKD2. From the limited data, there is no clear evidence of a difference in safety 
profile for these patients when treated with burosumab. However, the SmPC appropriately states that 
“Burosumab has not been studied in renal impairment” and there is a contraindication for severe renal 
impairment or ESRD. No further actions are considered warranted.   
There were no fatal events through the data cut-off date in any of the studies; and the one fatality 
reported after the data cut-off in UX023-CL303 was clearly unrelated. 
Before data cut-off, SAEs were reported in a total of 28 subjects on burosumab treatment and two on 
placebo treatment in the safety database. In total, one SAE was assessed as possibly related to study 
treatment (one event of angioedema in UX023-CL203). In this case, a woman on treatment with both 
lisinopril and burosumab developed a life-threatening event of angioedema, assessed as possibly related 
to both drugs by the Investigator. It is however agreed with the MAH that, as the subject continued on 
study medication without rechallenge hypersensitivity reactions after discontinuation of lisinopril, a causal 
association to lisinopril is more likely.  
In Study UX023-CL303, there was a somewhat higher number of SAEs in the burosumab→burosumab 
group Week 24-48 (n=5) compared to Week 0-24 (n=2) which raises the question as to the potential for 
increased adverse events with prolonged duration of treatment with burosumab. Upon request, the MAH 
has presented exposure adjusted event incidence for SAEs/year for the individual studies and then for 
total treated burosumab patients, all of which are low ranging from 0.004- 0.062. 
Among the 28 subjects reporting a SAE during burosumab treatment, four subjects reported malignancies 
(lung adenocarcinoma in a non-smoker subject, colon carcinoma in a subject with positive family history 
of genetic mutations for BRCA2 and MSH2, chordoma in a subject and a case of breast cancer in a  
female subject). None of these events were assessed as related. No further actions are therefore 
considered warranted at this time point. Nonetheless, the malignant chordoma is notable, as such 
malignancies are very rare. A single event like this is considered a coincidence, but should additional 
events be reported, this must be investigated in depth. At this time point, however, no additional reports 
on chordoma in a clinical study or as a post-marketing events have been retrieved.  
Three subjects in the adult safety database discontinued study drug because of a TEAE; one in Study 
KRN23-INT-001 (urticaria) and two in Study KRN23-INT-002 (nephrolithiasis; restless legs). The two 
subjects discontinuing KRN23-INT-002 later entered extension study UX023-CL203 without recurrence of 
the event through data cut-off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 132/151 
 
 
  
  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for Crysvita is Injection site reactions (IRS), Hypersensitivity, 
Hyperphosphataemia, Ectopic mineralisation, Restless legs (RLS) and Anti-burosumab antibodies (ADA).  
A lower incidence of ISR was reported in the adult (25%) compared to the paediatric population (58%). 
This is not entirely unexpected as the majority of the subjects in the paediatric clinical development 
program received burosumab every second week (Q2W), whereas the adult subjects were treated Q4W.  
The incidence of ISR was similar in the treatment arms during the placebo-controlled period of study 
UX023-CL303 (12% in each arm). 
Similarly, the difference in hypersensitivity TEAEs between the paediatric and adult populations (43% vs 
19%, respectively) may at least in part be explained by the difference in administration frequency. The 
only severe hypersensitivity event reported in the adult safety database was the event of angioedema 
discussed above.  
Hyperphosphataemia in adults was defined as serum phosphorus >4.5 mg/dL [>1.45 mmol/L]. In total, 
nine hyperphosphataemia TEAEs in eight subjects were reported in the adult studies, all in UX023-CL303. 
5/8 subjects with hyperphosphataemia required protocol-specified dose reductions. 
The selection of hyperphosphataemia episodes to be reported as hyperphosphataemia TEAE is not fully 
understood. 18/174 subjects (10%) in the adult safety database were reported with serum phosphorus 
levels above ULN at least at one occasion. In eleven of these eighteen subjects, the dose was reduced. Of 
those, nine events were reported as TEAE, whereas the remaining two, one subject each in UX023-CL303 
and UX023-CL203, were not.  
Seventeen of the totally eighteen subjects reporting hyperphosphataemia in the adult safety data base 
were enrolled in UX023-CL303. All events were reported during treatment with burosumab, either during 
the placebo-controlled period (N=9) or after switch to burosumab in the open-label phase (N=8), most 
often in the beginning of treatment. 
Hyperphosphataemia was not reported in any subject in the paediatric safety database at MAA. Due to 
the mechanism of action, hyperphosphataemia was not an unexpected finding but an anticipated event 
already reflected in SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. Furthermore, the MAH proposes to amend SmPC section 
4.8 for the adult population to include hyperphosphataemia, which is endorsed. However, it should be 
kept in mind that hyperphosphataemia may reflect over-suppression of FGF23. 
In the procedure leading to the conditional MA for the paediatric population, the timing of blood testing 
was extensively discussed. Blood tests were obtained fasting, before study drug was administered, and so 
do not display the peak phosphate concentration as serum phosphate concentration fluctuates / rises in 
response to dietary intake. In the initial MAA, testing of post-prandial phosphate levels was requested as 
substudies in both children (UX023-CL301) and adults (UX023-CL303). The MAH has provided a summary 
of data from both studies. The paediatric substudy consisted of 13 children >3 years of age, including 10 
subjects from the burosumabburosumab group and 3 subjects from the active controlburosumab 
group. The adult substudy included 26 subjects; 13 each from the burosumabburosumab group and the 
active controlburosumab group. In both studies, all subjects fasted for ≥8 hours prior to breakfast. In 
both substudies, blood samples for determination of serum phosphate were collected before breakfast 
and 1 and 2 hours after the completion of the meal. In the adult substudy, samples were also collected 
before lunch and 1 and 2 hours thereafter. Burosumab treatment did not cause post-prandial excursions 
above the age adjusted upper limits of normal in serum phosphorus or serum calcium in any subject in 
either substudy.  
Assessment of ectopic mineralisation in the kidney is not entirely straight forward, as on the one hand, 
nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis are features of XLH, but on the other hand, there is a risk of increased 
ectopic mineralisation due to an increase in urine calcium with burosumab treatment. However, in this 
limited material, there are no indications of an accelerated ectopic renal mineralisation by burosumab. 
The rate of nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis TEAEs during the 24 Week placebo-controlled period were 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 133/151 
 
 
  
  
comparable between the treatment arms (four events in the placebo arm versus three events in the 
burosumab arm) and there were no meaningful changes in shift in nephrocalcinosis score from baseline 
between the treatment arms during the same period.  
Cardiac ectopic mineralisation was assessed by ECHO. Of note, during the paediatric clinical studies, 
cardiac CT was also performed to detect ectopic mineralisation. The use of ECHO in monitoring for ectopic 
calcification was performed in line with clinical practice and thus accepted. The MAH was asked to discuss 
whether potential cardiac mineralisation should be monitored during treatment. The MAH has responded 
that no clinically meaningful changes from baseline or differences between treatment groups in any ECHO 
parameter were observed throughout these studies in adult XLH patients and that no cardiac safety signal 
was observed in paediatric XLH patients is accepted. Similarly, no cardiac signal has emerged in PSURs. 
Monitoring of biochemical parameters, such as serum phosphate, alone is therefore agreed. 
The exact mechanism of RLS in XLH subjects treated with burosumab is not known. It is hypothesised 
that increasing serum phosphorus levels near/into the normal range in subjects that have been 
chronically and severely hypophosphataemic may precipitate RLS symptoms/severity. The incidence of 
RLS was higher in the burosumab versus the placebo treatment arm during the double-blind period of 
study UX023-CL303 (12% vs 8%), indicating that a causal association is possible.  
20/134 (15%) of the subjects in UX023-CL303 had pre-existing ADA. Three of those had previously been 
treated with burosumab in another study. 7/20 subjects were ADA negative after baseline and none of 
the 13/20 continuously ADA positive subjects had an increase in antibody titre during treatment. 
Eight subjects were reported with treatment emergent ADA. These subjects had transient immune 
responses, with ADA-positive samples at only 1 or 2 post-treatment time points. No neutralising activity 
was detected in any of the ADA-positive subjects.  
To study the impact ADA on efficacy, the MAH has reviewed the serum phosphorus levels at Week 22 and 
Week 46 (peak effect) and Week 24 and Week 48 (trough value) in ADA-positive subjects compared to 
the overall population. For the four subjects with treatment-emergent antibodies in the burosumab arm, 
there was a trend towards a smaller mean change from baseline compared to the overall population 
(+0.78 versus +0.88 mg/dL, respectively, at Week 22 and +0.58 versus +0.94 mg/dL arm at Week 46). 
For the four subjects in the placebo arm, on the other hand, there was no such trend (+0.20 versus 
+0.10 mg/dL, respectively, at Week 22 and +1.33 versus +1.11 mg/dL arm at Week 46).  
To study the impact ADA on safety, the MAH has reviewed events of injection site reactions and 
hypersensitivity in 28 subjects positive for ADA at Baseline or any postbaseline visit in Study UX023-
CL303. 20/28 did not have burosumab-emergent ISRs or AEs of hypersensitivity, 5/28 had an ISR and 
3/28 reported at least one hypersensitivity AE. In all cases, the events resolved without discontinuation of 
the study drug. Events of ISRs and/or hypersensitivity were not necessarily coincident with the timing of 
samples testing positive for ADA, and no correlation between the occurrence of ISR, hypersensitivity AEs, 
and ADA was evident.  
The MAH was asked to present the occurrence of TEAEs of injection site reactions (ISRs) and 
hypersensitivity for patients who were ADA positive and ADA negative for both adult and paediatric 
populations. Most of the patients reporting such TEAEs were ADA negative. There did not appear to be 
any pattern to differences in occurrences e.g. grade of the adverse event based on ADA status. It is 
agreed that there is no evidence from the presented data that immunogenicity has an impact on TEAEs of 
ISRs or hypersensitivity AEs. No new information on ADA has emerged after the data base lock for the 
MAA.   
Long-term data in the adult population is still scarce. Overall, in the data provided, there were no new 
safety concerns or any relevant differences in safety profile with burosumab treatment beyond 6 or 12 
months compared to the first 6 months. 65 subjects received burosumab for more than 2 years. The 
safety profile of these subjects did not reveal any differences in the nature of the TEAEs compared to the 
overall safety profile of burosumab. The MAH has proposed to include adult patients in the PASS. The two 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 134/151 
 
 
  
  
ongoing studies, DMP and SUNFLOWER, should also provide further safety information. The MAH’s 
commitment to include other safety reports within PSURs is endorsed.  
No new and unexpected laboratory findings or impact on vital signs were identified in the adult database.  
Considering the potential for hyperparathyroidism in subjects with XLH, the MAH was asked to summarise 
all cases of hyperparathyroidism in the clinical development program. The overall analyses of all the 
TEAEs of hyperparathyroidism reflected mostly transient or intermittent changes in iPTH and no relevant 
clinical consequences were associated with these changes in laboratory results. Such transient changes 
were seen also for patients on placebo treatment. According to the MAH, there was a downward trend for 
iPTH concentrations for adult patients treated with burosumab compared to placebo. This will need further 
study before any definitive conclusions could be drawn in this regard. However, overall it is agreed that 
TEAEs of hyperparathyroidism that did occur in adult and paediatric clinical trials and also from post-
marketing data of burosumab were relatively low and in most cases did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation. 
At the time of the initial MAA, concerns were raised about the issue of elevated free FGF23 in serum. The 
applicant explained that the apparent increase in serum [free FGF-23] was an artefact of the assay 
system and that the presence of free FGF23 was believed to be minimal. The MAH has verified that the 
same assay was used in the adult studies. Moreover, at the time of the MAA, the MAH demonstrated that 
burosumab is expected to fully inhibit FGF23 following administration. Specifically, with 1mg/kg Q4W in 
particular in adult patients full FGF23 binding is expected over most of the dosing interval with only 
~0.1% unbound FGF23 at the end of the dosing interval.  
At study entry, most patients in XLH clinical development programme were overweight or obese and 
below average height. Only eight subjects had follow-up height measurement up to week 168; however, 
as Study UX023-CL303 was an adult population, no impact on height is expected. There was a trend 
towards a larger number of subjects in the burosumab treatment arm with weight decrease at Week 24 
versus placebo, whereas the number of subjects with weight increase tended to be larger in the placebo 
arm. However, both placebo- and burosumab-treated subjects showed fluctuations in weight and no 
definitive conclusions can be drawn.  
No new or unexpected post-marketing events are reported in PSURs submitted to the EMA or Periodic 
Adverse Drug Experience Report submitted to the FDA. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Crysvita has a conditional MAA for treatment of children with XLH from the age of one year and 
adolescents with growing skeletons. No children were included in the studies forming the adult clinical 
development program assessed in this report. 
Adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates have not been included in any clinical studies, neither in 
the paediatric nor the adult development program. In paediatric Study UX023-CL201, there were 11 
adolescent subjects identified whose growth plates closed during the course of the study. For one of the 
eleven subjects, the last reading with open growth plates was the Week 64 reading. The remaining ten 
subjects had open growth plates at the Week 88 reading. No information on safety in adolescents with 
closed epiphyseal growth plates is considered to be available from this limited group. Upon request, the 
MAH presented a summary of all available data on adolescents aged 12-18 years treated with 
burosumab. Available Data from adolescent subjects treated with burosumab Q2W dosing regimen 
demonstrates similar efficacy and safety profiles to the paediatric population from the Study UX023-
CL201 and two interim reports for Study KRN23-003 and KRN23-004.  
Thus, the safety profile in adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates needs to be extrapolated from 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 135/151 
 
 
  
  
the paediatric and adult subpopulations. The safety profile in the paediatric and adult population are 
similar with a few exceptions, e.g. hyperphosphataemia and restless legs. There are no reasons to 
suspect that the safety profile with burosumab treatment would differ in any meaningful way in this 
specific population compared to younger children or adults, given that the exposure is comparable. 
The MAH anticipates that data in adolescents will be generated by four planned or ongoing studies: the 
UK early access program (EAP), the UX023-CL401 X-Linked Hypophosphatemia Disease Monitoring 
Program (DMP), the Sunflower Study and the European Registry Study (2018-16-EU-BUR). Updates on 
the study status and safety data will be provided through routine PSURs and study reports will be 
submitted to the Agency as they become available. In their response, the MAH notifies that data from the 
UK EAP (n=132) includes a smaller group of adolescents than previously stated although the exact 
number has not been provided. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile in the adult safety database is in line with the known safety profile for Crysvita in the 
paediatric population. No new and unexpected safety issues have been identified in the adult population.  
Hyperphosphataemia was not reported in any subject in the paediatric safety database at the time of the 
initial MAA. Due to the mechanism of action, hyperphosphataemia was not an unexpected finding but an 
anticipated event already reflected in SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to 
amend SmPC section 4.8 for the adult population with hyperphosphataemia, which is endorsed. However, 
hyperphosphataemia may reflect over suppression of FGF23. According to PK/PD simulation results, there 
is an increased risk of hyperphosphataemia following burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W suggesting that this 
lower dose level, administered more frequently, would not be desirable to use in the adult population. 
Hence, the 1 mg/kg Q4W dosing is endorsed for the adult population. 
20/134 (15%) of the subjects in UX023-CL303 had pre-existing Anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Of those, 
7/20 subjects were ADA negative after baseline and none of the 13/20 continuously positive after 
baseline had an increase in antibody titre during treatment. 
Eight subjects were reported with treatment emergent ADA. These subjects had transient immune 
responses, with ADA-positive samples at only 1 or 2 post-treatment time points. No neutralising activity 
was detected in any of the ADA-positive subjects. The MAH was asked to present the occurrence of TEAEs 
of injection site reactions (ISRs) and hypersensitivity for patients who were ADA positive and ADA 
negative for both adult and paediatric populations. The presented data did not indicate that 
immunogenicity has an impact on TEAEs of ISRs or hypersensitivity AEs.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 2.1 during the procedure.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.1 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is characterised by high levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 
23 (FGF23) that leads to excessive urinary phosphate excretion and subsequent hypophosphataemia, 
resulting in defective bone mineralisation and impacts to other tissues such as muscle.  
The major pathologic consequences of XLH in bone are rickets, osteomalacia, fractures and bone 
deformities requiring surgical intervention. XLH in children is associated with substantial skeletal 
deformities that cause pain and impair physical functioning, such that a young child may be severely 
limited in his/her daily activities and will suffer lifelong disability, social stigmatisation, and pain as these 
deformities become a permanent structure of their bones. In adults, the chronic osteomalacia often leads 
to development of short stature, bowed limbs, pathologic fractures and pseudofractures, early 
osteoarthritis, and enthesopathies, which cause stiffness, and pain requiring use of analgesic drugs. 
These impairments may limit physical function and impact quality of life. 
Burosumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the 
excessive biological activity of FGF23, thereby treating the underlying cause of XLH.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Conventional therapy for XLH consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with 
active vitamin D. In children, burosumab is approved in the EU for the treatment of XLH.  
Despite the consensus regarding conventional treatment of children with XLH, its efficacy in improving 
skeletal outcomes has not been demonstrated in prospective, randomised clinical trials.  
In adults, oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy may be initiated (or maintained) for the treatment 
of osteomalacia, bone/joint pain and other symptoms, and pathologic fractures or pseudofractures 
(Carpenter et al, 2011; Linglart et al, 2014; Haffner et al, 2019), but evidence of efficacy to improve 
osteomalacia, bone mineral density, microarchitecture or pain in adults is limited or the data shows 
absence of positive effect (Sullivan et al, 1992; Shanboghue et al, 2018).  
Furthermore, multiple daily doses of oral phosphate produce a transient and intermittent increase in 
serum phosphorus (Glorieux et al, 1980) that can exacerbate phosphate wasting because the impairment 
in renal phosphate reabsorption is not addressed. This intermittent phosphate load triggers high urinary 
phosphate excretion and increases risk and progression of nephrocalcinosis, also in adolescents who 
would have received shorter periods of oral therapy.

In the light of this, an unmet need for a specific treatment of XLH in adolescents and adults is 
acknowledged.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The primary evidence of burosumab efficacy in adults with XLH comes from Study UX023-CL303. 
Supportive efficacy data are provided from Study UX023-CL304, Study UX023-CL203 and the two phase 
1/2 studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002. 
UX023-CL303 is an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study with open-
label extension to assess the efficacy and safety of burosumab SC Q4W 1.0 mg/kg in XLH patients 18-65 
years (N = 134; 68 burosumab, 66 placebo). The planned study duration is up to 157 weeks. The 
placebo-controlled double-blind phase was 24 Weeks. At this time point, Week 48 data is presented.  
UX023-CL304 is an ongoing open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 study to evaluate the effects of burosumab 
SC Q4W 1.0 mg/kg on osteomalacia by bone biopsies in XLH patients 18-65 years (N = 14). The planned 
study duration is up to 144 weeks. At this time point, Week 48 data is presented. 
KRN23-INT-001 was a 120-day long Phase 1/2, open-label, repeat-dose, dose-escalation study of 
KRN23 in XLH patients ≥18 years (N = 32; 28 burosumab, 1 placebo; 3 subjects discontinued before 
treatment) investigating the effect of burosumab SC Q4W 0.05, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg.  
KRN23-INT-002 was an open-label, long-term, 12-month extension study to KRN23-INT-001 (N = 23; 
22 burosumab, 1 placebo) with dose-escalation (burosumab SC Q4W 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg). 
UX023-CL203 is an ongoing, Phase 2b, open-label, long-term extension study to KRN23-INT-001 and 
KRN23-INT-002 (N = 20). The planned study duration is 194 weeks. Data is currently available for all 
subjects to Week 48. Available doses are burosumab SC Q4W 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Serum phosphate 
The primary endpoint of study UX023-CL303 was the proportion of subjects achieving mean serum 
phosphorus levels above the lower level of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]) at the midpoint of the 
dose interval (i.e., 2 weeks after each dose of study drug, the time of peak PD effect), as averaged across 
dose cycles between Baseline and Week 24. 
The primary endpoint was met as 94.1% (95% CI 85.8, 97.7) of the subjects in the burosumab arm 
achieved mean serum phosphorus levels above LLN compared to 7.6% (95% CI 3.3, 16.5) in the placebo 
arm (p<0.0001).  
The results from the selected secondary phosphate endpoints are summarised below. 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving a mean serum phosphorus concentration above the LLN across 
the ends (time of trough PD effect) of the dose intervals through Week 24: placebo 6% (95%CI 
2.4, 14.6), burosumab 68% (95%CI 55.8, 77.6). 
•  Mean Change (SD) from Baseline at the midpoint of each dose cycle, as averaged across dose 
cycles (mg/dL): placebo 0.16 (0.272), burosumab 1.21 (0.510). 
•  Mean Change (SD) from Baseline at the end of each dose cycle, as averaged across dose cycles 
(mg/dL): placebo 0.13 (0.265), burosumab 0.69 (0.392). 
Primary and secondary phosphate endpoints from the open-label studies support the results from study 
UX023-CL303.

Patient recorded outcomes (PRO) 
Only PRO data from the placebo-controlled, double-blind period of UX023-CL303 are discussed below. The 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scales are 10-point scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). 
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scales ranges from 0 (best 
health state) to 100 (worst).  
The BPI Worst Pain score at week 24 was the only originally prespecified key secondary endpoint. The 
mean worst pain decreased in the placebo group from 6.5 to 6.1 and from 6.8 to 5.8 in the burosumab 
group. The LS Mean [SE] Change from Baseline was -0.32 (0.22) in the placebo arm and -0.79 (0.21) in 
the burosumab arm (p=0.092). 
During the study two additional key secondary endpoints were amended, WOMAC Physical Function score 
and WOMAC Stiffness score. 
In the burosumab arm, WOMAC Physical Function score decreased from 51 to 43 points between baseline 
and Week 24 compared to from 44 to 43 in the placebo arm. The LS Mean [SE] Change from Baseline 
was +1.8 (2.7) in the placebo arm and -3.1 (2.6) in the burosumab arm (p=0.048). 
In the burosumab arm, WOMAC Stiffness score decreased from 65 to 54 points between baseline and 
Week 24 compared to from 61 to 60 in the placebo arm. The LS Mean [SE] Change from Baseline was 
+0.5 (3.1) in the placebo arm and -7.8 (3.0) in the burosumab arm (p=0.011). 
Applying the Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing for the three endpoints, the difference between the 
treatment arms in BPI Worst Pain and WOMAC Physical Function score was not significant at the p<0.05 
and p<0.025 level, respectively, whereas WOMAC Stiffness score at Week 24 was significant at the 
p<0.0167 level. 
Upon request, the MAH has provided information on what could be considered minimal clinical important 
difference (MCID) for the key secondary endpoints. According to the MAH, the MCID for adults with XLH 
are 1.72 for the BPI-SF Worst Pain score, 9.3 for the WOMAC Physical Function score, and 10.0 for the 
WOMAC Stiffness score. For WOMAC Stiffness, mean improvement corresponding to MCID was reached 
by approximately Week 36 and for WOMAC Physical function beyond Week 96, whereas the mean 
improvements did not reach MCID for BPI Worst pain during the course of the study. 
The secondary endpoints in UX023-CL303 also included BPI Pain Severity, BPI Pain interference, Brief 
Fatigue Inventory (BFI; range 1-10) Worst Fatigue, and BFI Global Fatigue. There was a trend towards a 
favourable effect of burosumab in BPI Pain Severity score (LS mean difference between the treatment 
arms -0.4 [0.25]); however, no difference between the treatment arms was seen in BPI Pain interference, 
BFI Worst Fatigue, and BFI Global Fatigue. Also, no meaningful difference between the treatment arms in 
Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was seen at Week 24. 
Fracture/pseudofracture healing and enthesopathy 
In study UX023-CL303, enthesopathy and healing of active fractures and pseudofractures detected by x-
ray at baseline to the end of the study were exploratory endpoints. 
At baseline, 14 active fractures and 51 active pseudofracture were reported in the burosumab arm. In the 
placebo arm, 13 active fractures and 78 active pseudofractures were reported.  
The results at Week 24 are summarised below: 
•  Healed active fractures: burosumab 7/14 (50%), placebo 0/13 (0%) 
• 
Partially healed active fractures: burosumab 3/14 (21%), placebo 6/13 (46%).  
•  Healed active pseudofractures: burosumab 21/51 (41%), placebo 7/78 (9%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 142/151 
 
 
  
  
• 
Partially healed pseudofractures: burosumab 13/51 (26%), placebo 22/78 (28%) 
•  New findings from baseline to Week 24: burosumab 6, placebo 8  
The results at Week 48 are summarised below: 
•  Healed active fractures: burosumab 8/14 (57%), placebo 6/13 (46%) 
• 
Partially healed active fractures: burosumab 2/14 (14%), placebo 4/13 (31%).  
•  Healed active pseudofractures: burosumab 33/51 (65%), placebo 26/78 (33%) 
• 
Partially healed pseudofractures: burosumab 9/51 (18%), placebo 32/78 (41%) 
•  New findings from Week 24 to Week 48: burosumab 1, placebo 3 
No comparison in fracture healing between the treatment arms was planned. In a post-hoc analysis using 
a hierarchical generalised linear mixed proportional odds model showed an odds ratio between 
burosumab vs placebo for fracture healing of 16.8 (95% CI 4.9, 57.0; p<0.0001). 
Adult patients with XLH often have calcification of tendons and ligaments (enthesopathy) at sites of 
insertion into bone. Total calcaneal enthesopathy burden was added as an exploratory endpoint in 
protocol amendment 1. Therefore, few subjects completed this assessment at both Baseline and at Week 
24. 
The results are shown below:  
•  Mean (SD) total calcaneal enthesopathy burden at Week 24: burosumab (N=12) 5.90 (3.56) cm, 
placebo (N=10) 4.07 (2.38) cm  
• 
The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 24: burosumab -0.47 (0.64) cm, placebo -1.55 
(0.70) cm (p=0.26) 
•  Mean (SD) total calcaneal enthesopathy burden at Week 48: 5.25 (3.03) cm (N=52), 
placebo→burosumab group 5.99 (3.07) cm (N=45) 
• 
The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 48: burosumab→burosumab (N=52) -0.53 
(0.21) cm, placebo→burosumab (N=45) -0.12 (0.224) cm 
Bone mineralisation 
The primary objective in study UX023-CL304 was to establish the effect of burosumab treatment on 
improvement in XLH-associated osteomalacia (defective bone mineralisation) as determined by ration 
between osteoid (unmineralized bone) volume and total bone volume (OV/BV) by iliac bone biopsies. 
OV/BV is elevated in osteomalacia. 
The study met its primary endpoint as the OV/BV ratio decreased by 54% from baseline to Week 48 
(p<0.0001). This was supported by a decrease in osteoid (unmineralized bone) surface area/total bone 
surface area (OS/BS) (-26%; p=0.0002) and osteoid thickness (O.Th) (-32%; p<0.0001). 
At Baseline, all eleven subjects in Study UX023-CL304 had osteomalacia as determined by evaluation of 
the iliac crest bone biopsy. In the qualitative analysis of the bone biopsies at Week 48, although improved 
in 10/11 subjects, some grade of osteomalacia remained in all subjects. 
This data is supported by burosumab effect on the bone formation marker P1NP and the bone resorption 
marker CTx. For both markers, a marked increase was seen on burosumab treatment, reaching maximum 
after 12-24 weeks of treatment. The serum concentrations of both markers however remain above 
baseline values at Week 96 in both Study UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304. The increase in P1NP seemed 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 143/151 
 
 
  
  
to be both more pronounced and sustained than that of CTx in both studies, suggesting a positive 
remodelling balance with a net increase in bone formation. 
Six-minute walking test (6MWT) 
6MWT was an exploratory endpoint in UX023-CL303. 
At Baseline, the mean (SD) actual distance walked was 356.8 (109.46) m (range: 55 – 643 m) in the 
burosumab group and 367.4 (103.41) m (160 – 615 m) in the placebo group.  
At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) change from Baseline was 14.8 (7.67) m in the burosumab group and -5.0 
(7.54) m in the placebo group; the LS mean difference between treatment groups was 19.8 (7.67) m (p 
= 0.0108). 
The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline to Week 48 was 30.5 (6.93) m in the burosumab→burosumab 
group and 20.2 (8.76) m in the placebo→burosumab group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Originally, one single key secondary endpoint, BPI Worst Pain score at week 24, was prespecified in the 
protocol for study UX023-CL303. During the course of the study, WOMAC Stiffness and Physical Function 
domains were elevated to key secondary endpoints at the end of the double-blind treatment period. 
The MAH explained their late action with a wish to await more data from another study (UX023-CL001) 
before finally deciding on key secondary endpoints. After taking these results into consideration, the MAH 
decided that BPI Worst pain was not sufficient to address the spectrum of XLH symptomatology. In 
particular, according to the concept elicitation patient interviews, stiffness was the most prevalent and 
impactful XLH symptom. Therefore, the MAH decided to include WOMAC Stiffness and WOMAC Physical 
function as two supplementary key secondary endpoints in the study. 
The statistical methodology used for the analyses of change from baseline for the key PRO endpoints has 
been questioned. The MAH was requested to confirm that the assumption of normality of the underlying 
data had been confirmed in all cases, particularly in relation to the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
The tests suggest that the change scores were non-normal for all measures. As requested, the MAH also 
reanalysed the key secondary endpoints using a repeated measures ANCOVA. To confirm the 
appropriateness of the ANCOVA method on these key secondary endpoints, further analysis for the 
normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance was presented to confirm the appropriateness of the 
ANCOVA method on these key secondary endpoints. This is accepted. 
During the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period, five subjects in the burosumab group and none in the 
placebo group had treatment unblinded per protocol due to hyperphosphataemia. The MAH has clarified 
that although the notation was “subject unblinded”, only the investigator was unblinded. In addition, two 
cases of accidental unblinding were reported in study UX023-CL303, both in the burosumab group. 
According to the MAH, again, only site personnel were unblinded. However, the wording describing the 
events could be interpreted as that one of the subjects was actually unblinded. Notwithstanding, this is 
not considered to have any impact on the outcome of the study. 
Due to the erroneous stratification by baseline pain, there was an imbalance in pain intensity between the 
treatment arms, as BPI worst pain was >6.0 in 75% of the subjects in the burosumab versus 59% in the 
placebo arm. This may have impact in the Patient reported outcomes (PROs). Moreover, in a limited study 
population, double stratifications inevitably lead to some imbalances between the treatment arms for 
other baseline parameters, e.g. osteoarthritis and nephrocalcinosis were reported more often at baseline 
in the burosumab arm (69% vs 58% respectively for osteoarthritis and 16% vs 8% for nephrocalcinosis). 
Furthermore, use of opioids was more common in the burosumab arm, 25% vs 20% in the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 144/151 
 
 
  
  
Taken together, this may implicate that the treatment arms were not fully balanced regarding baseline 
pain and XLH manifestations. The MAH was asked to comment on the potential impact of this imbalance 
on the outcome of the study. Upon request, the MAH has conducted interaction analyses demonstrating 
that no significant interaction was identified for the primary endpoint. For the key secondary endpoints, 
one statistically significant interaction was detected, between presence of nephrocalcinosis at baseline 
and BPI Worst Pain (p= 0.0475). The observed interaction is difficult to interpret as nephrocalcinosis is 
normally asymptomatic.  
The Applicant has provided Forest plots displaying subgroup analysis for five baseline parameters not fully 
balanced, i.e. use of pain medication, use of opioid pain medication, baseline presence of osteoarthritis 
and baseline presence of nephrocalcinosis, with regard to the three key secondary endpoints as 
requested. None of the subgroups showed a consistent additional benefit in favour of burosumab across 
these key secondary endpoints, above that seen in the All Subjects group. Although statistical significance 
was not shown for most subgroups, the point estimate favours burosumab in all subgroups for the three 
key secondary endpoints.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The adult safety database comprises of 176 subjects having received at least one dose of burosumab in 
studies KRN23-INT-001/KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL203, UX023-CL303 and UX023-CL304. The total 
cumulative exposure is 205 patient-years and the mean duration of exposure was 61 weeks. 
96-100% of the subjects in the five studies were reported with a treatment emergent adverse event 
(TEAE), of which 55-64% were deemed as related to burosumab. 
In total, one SAE assessed as possibly related to study treatment (one event of angioedema in UX023-
CL203). In this case, a woman under treatment with both lisinopril and burosumab developed a life-
threatening event of angioedema, assessed as possibly related to both drugs by the Investigator. The 
MAH, on the other hand, considers that, as the subject continued on study medication without 
rechallenge hypersensitivity reactions after discontinuation of lisinopril, a causal association to lisinopril is 
more likely. 
The rates of reported TEAEs were comparable in both treatment arms during the placebo-controlled 
period of UX023-CL303 (94% in the burosumab arm and 92% in the placebo arm), whereas somewhat 
more TEAEs were deemed as treatment related in the burosumab arm (44% vs 39%). Two subjects (3%) 
in each treatment arm were reported with an SAE. No SAE was deemed as related to the study drug in 
UX023-CL303. 
Most TEAEs were balanced between the treatment arms. TEAEs more common in the burosumab included 
back pain (14% vs 6% for burosumab and placebo, respectively), tooth abscess (13% vs 8%), restless 
legs (RLS; 12% vs 8%) vitamin D decreased (12% vs 5%), dizziness (10% vs 6%), constipation (9% vs 
0%), and investigation (21% vs 14%). This is largely in line with the known safety profile of Crysvita. 
No fatality was reported before data cut-off in the safety data base. The fatal event reported after the 
data cut-off in UX023-CL303 was clearly unrelated to the study drug. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for Crysvita is Injection site reactions (IRS), Hypersensitivity, 
Hyperphosphataemia, Ectopic mineralisation, Restless legs (RLS) and Anti-burosumab antibodies (ADA). 
The incidence of ISR was the same in both treatment arms during the placebo-controlled period of study 
UX023-CL303 (12% in each arm), as were hypersensitivity TEAEs (5.9% vs 6.1% for burosumab and 
placebo, respectively).  
In total, nine hyperphosphataemia TEAEs in eight subjects were reported in the adult studies, all in the 
burosumab arm of UX023-CL303. However, totally 18/174 subjects (10%) in the adult safety database 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 145/151 
 
 
  
  
were reported with serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) at least at one 
occasion. No event of serum phosphorus above ULN was reported during placebo treatment. In eleven of 
these eighteen subjects, the dose was reduced. 
In the limited safety database, there are no indications of an accelerated ectopic renal or cardiac 
mineralisation by burosumab. 
20/134 (15%) of the subjects in UX023-CL303 had pre-existing ADA. Three of those had previously been 
treated with burosumab in another study. 7/20 subjects were ADA negative after baseline and none of 
the 13/20 continuously positive after baseline had an increase in antibody titre during treatment. 
Eight subjects were reported with treatment emergent ADA. These subjects had transient immune 
responses, with ADA-positive samples at only 1 or 2 post-treatment time points. No neutralising activity 
was detected in any of the ADA-positive subjects. The safety profile does not seem to differ between 
ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects. 
The MAH was asked to summarise safety data from subjects with baseline liver affection of any kind. In 
the adult repeat dose XLH studies, 55 out of a total of 176 subjects (31.3%) were found to have either a 
history of hepatobiliary disorder of any kind (n=16) and/or impairment in liver function tests (any value 
above upper limit of the normal range) (n=44) at baseline (“liver cohort”). Due to a low number of 
events, direct comparisons to the total study population is difficult, but there were no new safety 
concerns identified in the 55 subjects in the liver cohort. Of note, 8 of the 55 subjects (14%) in the liver 
cohort had TEAEs of abnormal liver function or hepatobiliary disorders, whilst 2 of 122 (2%) without liver 
impairment at baseline had TEAEs of abnormal liver function or hepatobiliary disorders. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Whilst the overall safety profile in adults is generally in line with that seen in the paediatric population, 
long-term data in the adult population is still scarce. The MAH was asked to address this. Overall, in the 
data provided in their response, there were no new safety concerns or any relevant differences in safety 
profile with burosumab treatment beyond 6 or 12 months compared to the first 6 months. 65 subjects 
received burosumab for more than 2 years. The MAH has proposed to include adult patients in the 
ongoing PASS, which is endorsed. The two ongoing studies, DMP and SUNFLOWER, should also provide 
further safety information in this regard. The MAH’s commitment to include other safety reports within 
PSURs is endorsed.  
Due to the low number of subjects with treatment emergent antibodies, it is difficult to draw any firm 
conclusions from the impact analyses for efficacy and safety performed by the MAH. It is however 
reassuring that no neutralising ADA activity has been detected. Moreover, the MAH presented data 
indicating that there were no differences in occurrence of TEAEs of injection site reactions (ISRs) and 
hypersensitivity for patients who were ADA positive and ADA negative in both adult and paediatric 
populations. No new information on ADA after the data base lock for the MAA is available at this time 
point. 
Hyperphosphataemia was not reported in any subject in the paediatric safety database at the time of the 
initial MAA. Due to the mechanism of action, hyperphosphataemia was not an unexpected finding but an 
anticipated event already reflected in SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. Furthermore, the MAH proposes to 
amend section 4.8 for the adult population to include hyperphosphataemia, which is endorsed.  
14% of the subjects with baseline liver affection had TEAEs of abnormal liver function or hepatobiliary 
disorders, compared to 2% in the group without a history of hepatobiliary disorder of any kind and/or 
impairment in liver function tests. It is agreed with the Applicant that it is to be expected that any 
individual with underlying hepatic disorder or conditions predisposing to hepatic disease could be more 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 146/151 
 
 
  
  
likely to experience hepatic related events, in the absence of health intervention intended to treat existing 
hepatic function abnormalities. The applicant should continue to monitor for hepatic related safety signals 
in burosumab treated patients as part of routine PV monitoring. 
Simulations from the PK/PD model showed that burosumab exposure estimates are greater following 
burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W dosing than burosumab 1.0 mg/kg Q4W and differences in PK translates to 
relatively smaller changes from baseline of serum phosphorus due to saturation of the PK/PD mechanism. 
For the clinical endpoint of serum phosphorus levels, the predicted levels at Cmin, Cavg, and Cmax are all 
similar between the regimens. It should be noted that at all exposure measures, the 95th percentile of 
serum phosphorus predictions are greater following 0.8 mg/kg Q2W than those for burosumab 1.0 mg/kg 
Q4W. Given that following burosumab 1.0 mg/kg Q4W administration to adults in Study UX023-CL303, 
events of hyperphosphataemia occurred, burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W administration in adults may put 
this population at an increased risk for hyperphosphataemia.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The manifestations of XLH differ in children with growing skeleton and older adolescents and adults. In 
children, XLH is associated with rickets, bone deformities and impaired growth, which, if untreated leads 
to short stature when the epiphyseal growth plates close.  
In adults, it is no longer possible to affect skeletal growth. The symptomatology in adults is characterised 
by premature osteoarthritis, enthesopathy (calcification of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules), an 
increased risk of fracture/pseudofractures with impaired healing and an increased risk of osteoporosis, all 
due to a combination of osteomalacia (poor mineralisation of the bone) and residual damage from rickets 
in childhood. This is associated with pain and stiffness. Spinal stenosis and tooth abscesses/tooth 
infections in the absence of caries are also part of the clinical picture in adults. Furthermore, 
hypophosphataemia per se is believed to contribute with diffuse symptoms such as weakness, fatigue and 
bone and muscle pain. Whereas some of the adult XLH manifestations are considered modifiable, e.g. 
osteomalacia, others are not, e.g. enthesopathy and osteoarthritis.  
Due to these differences, the indication for treatment partly differs between the two populations. The 
primary goal with treatment in children is to prevent slow growth and deformities of the long bones, i.e. 
bowing. Such treatment effects could be evaluated by standardised methods. In adults, on the other 
hand, the treatment is at least partly symptomatic. Therefore, the treatment effect of burosumab may be 
more difficult to assess in the adult population than in the paediatric population.  
The choice of comparator (i.e., placebo) is acceptable due to the practical feasibility to perform a blinded 
study between standard of care (conventional XLH treatment with oral phosphate and active vitamin-D 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020

analogues) given perorally several times daily and burosumab administered subcutaneously every fourth 
week. Nevertheless, this implies that it is not possible in the adult study program to draw any conclusions 
on burosumab efficacy compared to conventional phosphate/D-vitamin treatment. 
The increase in serum phosphorus concentration with burosumab treatment in adults is considered solid 
and convincing. This is a clear indication that the effect of burosumab on FGF23 function in adults is 
consistent with the effect in the paediatric population. Even though serum phosphate could be seen as a 
surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for clinical effect, chronic hypophosphataemia is a major contributor 
to the pathophysiology of the disease as described above. It is anticipated that normalisation of serum 
phosphate may have a beneficial effect on modifiable XLH manifestations, e.g. improved bone 
calcification, and possibly also by decreasing the deterioration rate of irreversible XLH damages. In 
addition, normalisation of serum phosphate should have a direct positive effect on symptoms from low 
serum phosphate per se, e.g. muscle weakness and fatigue. The increase in serum phosphorus 
concentration shown with burosumab treatment in adults is therefore considered clinically relevant.  
The key secondary endpoints are afflicted with some weaknesses. The treatment arms were not fully 
balanced regarding XLH manifestations at baseline, indicating that the disease burden may have been 
larger in the burosumab arm. To address any impact of this on the primary and key secondary endpoints, 
the MAH provided interaction analyses and subgroup analyses for the baseline parameters presence of 
osteoarthritis, presence of nephrocalcinosis, BPI Worst pain, use of pain medication, and use of opioids. 
As expected, no significant interaction was identified for the primary endpoint serum phosphate and any 
of the five baseline parameters. For the key secondary endpoints, one interaction was identified. 
However, the value of interaction testing is limited in such a small population as the power for detection 
of interactions is low and the results are difficult to interpret. The Applicant has provided Forest plots 
displaying post-hoc subgroup analysis for the above-mentioned five baseline parameters with regard to 
the three key secondary endpoints as requested. Although statistical significance was not shown for most 
subgroups, the point estimate favours burosumab in all subgroups for the three key secondary endpoints.   
The burosumab effect on the original key secondary endpoint BPI Worst Pain was numerically modest and 
not statistically significant. The additional key secondary endpoints WOMAC physical function and WOMAC 
Stiffness both had a nominal p-value >0.005, but due to gatekeeping as well as the use of the Hochberg 
method for the three key secondary endpoints, only in WOMAC Stiffness scale, the difference between the 
treatment arms turned out statistically significant. Moreover, the baseline scores for WOMAC Physical 
function scale were not balanced between the treatment arms; in fact, the difference between the 
baseline score was similar to the difference between baseline and Week 24 score in the burosumab arm. 
Taking also the other secondary PRO endpoints into consideration, the results are not fully concordant. 
On the other hand, the MAH has provided relevant justification for the modest effect reported on the PRO 
scales. Bone biopsies in Study UX023-CL304 indicate that improvement of osteomalacia may continue 
beyond Week 48. Taken these data into consideration, the 24-week-long placebo-controlled period of the 
study may not have been sufficient to fully characterize the improvements in pain and physical function 
that result from improvements in the underlying bone disease. The MAH further argues that a similar 
effect as in the burosumab arm Week 0-24 was seen in the placebo → burosumab arm after transition to 
active treatment. This is acknowledged; however, keeping in mind the inherent difficulties in assessing 
self-reported data in an open-label setting.  
Taken together, while the quantitative effect of burosumab on PROs is considered modest, the totality of 
these data and the consistency of effect among the assessments support the view that the effects are 
meaningful. It should however be noted that some of the XLH manifestations are considered irreversible 
while others are deemed modifiable with treatment. This may result in a heterogenicity in the population 
with a very different response to burosumab on XLH symptomatology. 
The positive effect on 6MWT and fracture/pseudofracture healing are considered clinically relevant; 
however, up to Week 24, there was no meaningful difference in the rate of new fractures between the 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 149/151 
 
 
  
  
treatment arms. As discussed above, this may reflect the slow restoration of bone structure. This is 
supported by a decreasing rate of new fractures with time. A beneficial effect of burosumab on bone 
structure is also supported by the bone formation and bone resorption markers P1NP and CTx being 
elevated above baseline beyond Week 96, indicative of an active bone remodelling and by the primary 
analysis from the bone biopsy study UX023-CL304 showing a decrease in osteoid volume.  
The safety profile presented in this application is largely compatible with the known safety profile from 
the approved paediatric population. However, as opposed to the paediatric population where no events of 
hyperphosphataemia were reported in the clinical paediatric studies constituting the MAA for this 
population, Hyperphosphataemia was reported in approximately 10% of the adult subjects. Due to the 
mechanism of action, hyperphosphataemia was not an unexpected finding but an anticipated event. 
Hyperphosphataemia may reflect over-suppression of FGF23. According to PK/PD simulation results, there 
is an increased risk of hyperphosphataemia following burosumab 0.8 mg/kg Q2W suggesting that this 
lower dose level, administered more frequently, would not be desirable to use in the adult population. 
Hence, the 1 mg/kg Q4W dosing is endorsed for the adult population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A solid and convincing effect was seen with respect to serum phosphorus levels in the pivotal study. Even 
though serum phosphate could be seen as a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for clinical effect, 
chronic hypophosphataemia is a major contributor to the pathophysiology and progression of the disease. 
The effect on subjective XLH manifestations as assessed by patient reported outcome scales was modest, 
but indicative of the effects being meaningful. However, in this context it should be noted that the effects 
may depend on the degree of irreversible damage. Further support for a positive treatment effect of 
burosumab is given by data on fracture healing and bone calcification. Therefore, based on the totality of 
data a positive effect of burosumab also in the adult population is considered established. The risk profile 
is considered to be in line with that of the approved paediatric population, apart from a potentially higher 
risk of hyperphosphatemia.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates have not been included in any clinical studies, neither in 
the paediatric nor the adult development program. The proposed posology for this population is based on 
PK/PD modelling and simulation. The simulated doses indicate that a dosing regimen of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
provide a meaningful dose, i.e. phosphorus levels within the normal range, for adolescent patients. 
As the manifestations of XLH differs from subjects with open to subjects with closed epiphyseal growth 
plates, efficacy data cannot be extrapolated from younger children. However, there are no reasons to 
suspect that the burosumab effect would differ in any meaningful way between adults and adolescents 
with closed growth plates, provided a similar exposure.  
In paediatric Study UX023-CL201, there were 11 adolescent subjects identified whose growth plates 
closed during the course of the study. For one of the eleven subjects, the last reading with open growth 
plates was the Week 64 reading. The remaining ten subjects had open growth plates at the Week 88 
reading. No information on safety in adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates is considered to be 
available from this limited group.  
Thus, the safety profile in adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates needs to be extrapolated from 
the paediatric and adult subpopulations. The safety profile in the paediatric and adult population are 
similar with a few exceptions, e.g. hyperphosphataemia and restless legs. There are no reasons to 
suspect that the safety profile with burosumab treatment would differ in any meaningful way in this 
specific population compared to younger children or adults, given that the exposure is comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/423776/2020 
Page 150/151 
 
 
  
  
Thus, the B/R for burosumab in adolescents with closed epiphyseal growth plates is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Crysvita is positive.

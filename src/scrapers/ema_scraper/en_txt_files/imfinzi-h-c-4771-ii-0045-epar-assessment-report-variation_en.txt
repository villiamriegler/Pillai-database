with  unresectable  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (uHCC),  based  on  final  results  from  Study  D419CC00002 
(HIMALAYA);  This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  multi-center  phase  III  study  of  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with  unresectable  hepatocellular  carcinoma.  As  a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes 
in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. Version 6.1 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0106/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  MAH  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised 
orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a  condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 18 May 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3558/1/2017/II). The 
Scientific advice pertained to the clinical aspects of the dossier, such as the principles of the statistical 
analyses of the Himalaya study and the design of the supportive study 22.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) regardless of tumoral PD-L1 expression. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The initially claimed new therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC was: 
Durvalumab  in  combination  with  tremelimumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The indication was updated during the procedure to: 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
The incidence of HCC increases progressively with advancing age in all populations, reaching a peak at 
70 years (El-Serag 2012, White et al 2017). Rates of both incidence and mortality are 2 to 3 times higher 
among men than among women in most regions (Sung et al 2021).  
The main risk factors for HCC are chronic infection with HBV or HCV, aflatoxin-contaminated foods, heavy 
alcohol  intake,  excess  body  weight,  type  2  diabetes,  and  smoking.  The  major  risk  factors  vary  from 
region to region, which is reflected in the incidence of HCC across geographic regions (Sung et al 2021). 
The highest incidence rates are seen in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, while lower rates are seen in 
Europe and North America (WHO 2019). 
Worldwide, HBV causes an estimated 75% to 80% of HCC cases, while HCV causes 10% to 20% of cases 
(Perz et al 2006). HCV infection (particularly in the US, Japan, and Egypt [Mak et al 2018, McGlynn et 
al 2015]), excessive alcohol consumption, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (linked to the growing 
prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes) represent the main risk factors for HCC (Vogel et al 2019).  
Biologic features 
Normal  liver  tolerogenic  mechanisms  are  likely  responsible  for  chronic  liver  inflammation  or 
carcinogenesis. Chronic presentation of pathological antigens in the liver can actively suppress immune 
responses,  thus  inducing  a  state  of  immune  tolerance  to  the  pathogen  or  tumour.  Hepatocellular 
carcinoma  takes  advantage  of  peripheral  tolerance  to  evade  cell  mediated  immune  responses,  which 
allows the tumour to grow. Chronic hepatic inflammatory responses are the number one risk factor for 
liver tumour development (Makarova-Rusher et al 2015). 
Moreover, increased expression of immunosuppressive cell populations, such as regulatory T cells and 
myeloid derived suppressor cells, and inhibitory signalling molecules, such as CTLA 4 and PD 1, have 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 8/137 
 
 
  
 
 
been observed in HCC (Gao et al 2009, Hato et al 2014, Pardee and Butterfield 2012) and is additionally 
associated  with  HBV  and  HCV  infection.  This  upregulation  contributes  to  the  immunosuppressive 
environment for HCC and highlights the importance of the PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 pathways in HCC (Golden-
Mason et al 2007, Pardee and Butterfield 2012, Peng et al 2008).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The HCC prognosis and treatment depend on factors such as tumour burden, degree of liver dysfunction, 
and clinical performance status (PS) (Marrero et al 2018, Vogel et al 2019). Hepatocellular carcinoma 
classically  develops  and  grows  in  silent  fashion,  making  its  discovery  challenging  prior  to  the 
development  of  later  stage  disease  (Bialecki  and  Di  Bisceglie  2005),  which  usually  leads  to  a  late 
diagnosis, with a median survival following diagnosis of approximately 6 to 20 months (McGlynn et al 
2015). Hepatocellular carcinoma is a medically complex and difficult to treat disease as the majority of 
patients have underlying cirrhosis requiring management of both the malignancy and underlying liver 
disease.  Hence,  the  5-year  survival  rate  for  HCC  is  less  than  20%  (Sarveazad  et  al  2019,  Villanueva 
2019). Unresectable HCC remains a difficult to treat disease, and the majority of patients will ultimately 
die of either HCC or complications of liver disease. 
Management 
Sorafenib, an oral TKI targeting multiple kinases, including VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 and BRAF, has been the 
standard of care (SOC) for advanced HCC in the first-line setting since its approval in 2007, which was 
based on improvement compared to placebo, establishing a median OS of 10.7 months (vs 7.9 months 
for placebo [Llovet et al 2008]). Subsequent studies have demonstrated a median OS ranging from 10.7 
to 13.4 months (Finn et al 2021, Llovet et al 2008, Yamashita et al 2020). In 2018, lenvatinib, another 
multiple kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, -2, -3, and 
-4, was approved as first-line treatment for advanced HCC in patients without main portal vein invasion 
and ECOG PS 0 to 1. Lenvatinib demonstrated non-inferiority to sorafenib in a Phase III study, with a 
median  OS  of  13.6 months vs  12.3 months with  sorafenib (Kudo et al  2018).  Atezolizumab (a PD-L1 
inhibitor)  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  (an  angiogenesis  inhibitor  targeting  vascular  endothelial 
growth factor A) has also been approved in the first-line setting, after the Phase III IMbrave150 study 
showed improvements in OS and PFS compared to sorafenib (Finn et al 2020b, Finn et al 2021). The 
NCCN,  ESMO,  and  Japanese  Society  of  Hepatology  guidelines  were  updated  in  2020  to  recommend 
atezolizumab  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  as  the  preferred  option  to  treat  first-line  HCC  (NCCN 
Guidelines 2021, JSH 2021; Vogel and Martinelli 2021 [ie, ESMO Guidelines 2021]). 
Regorafenib and cabozantinib (both multitargeted TKIs) have been approved for patients with advanced 
HCC, who have tolerated and progressed on sorafenib (Abou-Alfa et al 2018, Bruix et al 2017). Another 
approved  second-line  therapy  is  ramucirumab  (a  monoclonal  antibody  against  VEGFR  2),  which  has 
improved survival in patients with serum AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL and previous treatment with sorafenib (Zhu 
et al 2019). In addition, nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 mAb) in combination with ipilimumab (an anti CTLA-4 
mAb)  has  recently  received  accelerated  approval  from  the  FDA  for  patients  previously  treated  with 
sorafenib, due to results from the CheckMate 040 study, a Phase II study in which nivolumab (1 mg/kg, 
Q3W) plus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg Q3W × 4) (N=50; 28/50 [56%] with HBV) achieved a 32% ORR (Yau 
et al 2020). 
Unmet medical need 
Despite recent advances in treatment options, patients with uHCC continue to have a low life expectancy 
and  the  underlying  liver  disease  and  portal  vein  hypertension  increase  the  risk  of  gastrointestinal 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 9/137 
 
 
  
 
 
bleeding  in  patients  with  advanced  HCC,  which  can  be  potentially  life-threatening  (Boregowda  et  al 
2019). Currently available therapies provide only a modest improvement in survival with safety profiles 
that require management due to adverse events such as diarrhoea, hypertension, and palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  (PPE)(Cheng  et  al  2009,  Lencioni  et  al  2014,  Llovet  et  al  2008).  Treatment  with 
atezolizumab  plus  bevacizumab  also  carries  a  higher  incidence  of  bleeding,  including  fatal  bleeding, 
despite attempts to exclude patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding from the pivotal study (NCCN 
Guidelines  2021).  Moreover,  the  underlying  liver  cirrhosis  may  result  in  moderate  liver  dysfunction, 
which  may  exacerbate  the  toxicity  of  systemic  therapies  such  as  TKIs  (Cheng  et  al  2020).  Hence, 
additional therapeutic options are needed, including options for patients with uHCC who are at higher 
risk of bleeding events, so there exist an unmet medical need for better and tolerable treatment options 
for patients with uHCC. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Durvalumab binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) (but not programmed cell death ligand-
2) and thus blocks its interaction with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes (T-cells) and 
cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 (B7.1) on immune cells (ICs) and  is engineered to reduce antibody-
dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  Blockade  of  PD-L1/PD-1  and  PD-L1/CD80  interactions 
releases the inhibition of immune responses and may result in tumour regressions including objective 
responses based on tumour cell reduction as well as in stable disease due to tumour growth control. This 
mechanism of action may elicit eventually delay of progression and extension of survival. 
Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, NSCLC in adult patients 
whose tumours express PD L1 on ≥1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following 
platinum-based  chemoradiation  therapy  (EMEA/H/C/004771/0000).  Durvalumab  is  also  approved  in 
combination  with  standard-of-care  platinum-based  chemotherapy  as  1L  treatment  of  extensive  stage 
small cell lung cancer (ES SCLC; EMEA/H/C/004771/II/0014/G).

Scientific Advice 
commented that the proposed interim analysis may lack 
May 2017 
power and/or maturity when investigating all subgroups 
(including patients with low expression of PD-L1 in whom 
prognosis may be better and treatment efficacy less 
pronounced). 
The design of Study 22 is appropriate, but contribution of 
components is dependent on results and could be driven by 
PD-L1 expression. 
19 Jan 2022 
Joint Pre-
AstraZeneca held a joint pre-submission meeting with the 
submission 
Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur to review the planned 
Meeting 
submission of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab 
for the treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma. 
The Rapporteur acknowledged that HIMALAYA was well-
designed to evaluate contribution of components. It was 
noted, however, that the added benefit of tremelimumab 
relative to the safety profile of the combination would be a 
key consideration in the review. 
Additionally, study integrity will be a key consideration for 
the Agency during their review. The Rapporteur sought 
assurance to support that study integrity was maintained, as 
the non-inferiority margin was adopted without prior agency 
feedback during the conduct of the study.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Durvalumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a protein being extensively degraded in the patient’s body 
by  regular  proteolytic  mechanisms  before  excretion.  Durvalumab  is  expected  to  biodegrade  in  the 
environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline 
on 
the 
Environmental  Risk  Assessment 
of  Medicinal 
Products 
for  Human  Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2), durvalumab is exempt from the submission of Environmental  Risk 
Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.  
Durvalumab is human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 kappa subclass. Antibodies are considered 
naturally occurring proteins, which are not expected to remain either stable or biologically active in the 
environment for any significant period. The justification for not performing any ERA studies is 
accepted. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

[a] For Study 06, an NCA was done for an interim dataset (DCO 28 February 2017). As the final dataset (DCO 19 
November 2019) only had 343 additional samples (all in the dose-expansion phase) compared to the interim, it was 
determined that an additional NCA for the final dataset was not required. This was supported by the sparse 
sampling in the dose-expansion phase patients (~2 samples per patient per treatment), which would contribute 
little to no value to a NCA, which typically relies on intense sampling in order to accurately estimate key PK 
parameters such as half-life and AUC. Therefore, only the results of the interim NCA are presented. 
[b] Patients in the EP alone group were permitted an additional 2 cycles of EP (up to 6 cycles total) per the 
Investigator's discretion.

Durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  are  both  human  monoclonal  antibodies  (mAb)  that  act  as  checkpoint 
inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action with respect to enhancing the antitumor 
immune response.  
The  clinical  pharmacological  data  are  derived  from  1  pivotal  study  (HIMALAYA)  and  20  supportive 
durvalumab studies and 17 supportive tremelimumab studies.

All studies included male and female patients aged 18 years and older with advanced solid tumors. No 
PK data has been obtained from healthy volunteers. 
The clinical pharmacology studies that support this proposed indication are summarized in Table 2. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Durvalumab population PK analysis 
The  primary  objectives  of  the  PopPK  analysis  were  (1)  to  characterize  the  PK  of  durvalumab,  using 
HIMALAYA and Study 22 data combined with data from previous clinical trials that studies durvalumab 
in various indications (CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, CASPIAN and POSEIDON), (2) to 
assess  the  impact  of  pre-defined  covariates  on  individual  post-hoc  PK  parameters  and  (3)  to  derive 
individual  predicted  exposure  metrics  (AUC,  dose1,  Cmax,  dose1,  Cmin,  dose1,  AUC0-inf,  AUCss, 
Cmax,ss,  Cmin,ss)  of  durvalumab  for  patients  based  on  individual  Empirical  Bayes  Estimates  (EBEs) 
from the population PK models.  
The population PK analysis of durvalumab was derived from a total dataset of 4043 patients, of which 
2827  patients  were  from  the  previous  dataset  and  295  were  from  Study  22  and  928  were  from 
HIMALAYA. 216 BLQ samples (1.45%) were excluded from the analysis of which 83 of those samples 
were from Study 22 and HIMALAYA. 49 samples (1.5%) from Study 22 and HIMALAYA were also excluded 
from  the  analysis  due  to  incorrect  PK  sample  time.  Eventually,  14760  serum  PK  samples  from  4043 
patients treated with durvalumab were available in the final dataset for analysis.  
Previously, durvalumab population PK (Population PK and Exposure-Response Report (MS-2021)) was 
described by a two-compartment distribution model with time-dependent CL. IIV was included on CL, 
V1  and  Tmax.  Residuals  were  described  by  a  combined  additive  and  proportional  error  model.  The 
previous model included several statistically significant covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination 
therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, and ECOG; and on V1: WT and sex.  
The updated model was re-evaluated based on the current data and previous developed model structure. 
From  full  covariate  model,  backward  elimination  was  considered  to  find  a  statistically  parsimonious 
model.  Significance  levels  of  0.001  was  employed.  After  backward  elimination,  the  full  model  was 
explored by graphical inspection of all covariate effects (plots and correlation coefficients of empirical 
Bayes estimates of individual random effects from the full model vs. covariates). Results suggested that 
all previous covariates were important as the objective function value (OFV) increased by  ≥ 12 points 
when  excluding  either  of  them.  Race,  region  and  tumour  type  (NSCLC,  bladder  and  HCC)  were  also 
tested  on  CL  and  V1.  These  analyses  re-confirmed  race  and  region  were  not  significant  covariate  for 
durvalumab, while tumour type was considered significant on CL of durvalumab and therefore included 
in the model.  
The  following  model  was  chosen  as  the  final  model  for  durvalumab:  a  two-compartment  distribution 
model  with  time-dependent  CL.  IIV  on  CL,  V1  and  Tmax.  Residuals  were  described  by  a  combined 
proportional and additive error model. The final model included several statistically significant covariate 
effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, ECOG and tumour type (NSCLC, bladder 
and HCC); and on V1: WT and sex.  
The  relationships  between  the  covariates  and  the  model  parameters  are  described  in  the  following 
equations:

where CLcat.cov,  CLcont.cov and CLT,i  represent  the impact of categorical  and continuous covariates 
and the individual total CL including the time-dependent decrease of CL respectively.

of DV vs. PRED, DV vs. IPRED, CWRES vs. PRED and CWRES vs. time after dose can be seen in Figure 
1. A pcVPC of the final model for HIMALAYA is shown in Figure 2.  
The durvalumab population PK model was updated with sparse data from HIMALAYA and Study 22 and 
pooled with the previous dataset (Studies CASPIAN, PACIFIC, ATLANTIC, POSEIDON and CD-ON-MEDIA-
4736-1108). 
The final model included the following covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination therapy, sex, CrCL, 
LDH, ECOG and tumour type (solid, NSCLC, bladder and HCC); and on V1: WT and sex. The final model 
was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis, RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs.

Durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure-Response modelling analysis (MS-2021-02) 
The ER analysis for both efficacy and safety was based on patients from HIMALAYA study administered 
1500  mg  Q4W  durvalumab  and  a  300  mg  single  dose  tremelimumab  IV.  388  and  397  patients  were 
included 
in 
the  ER  analysis 
for  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab,  respectively.  The 
final 
durvalumab/tremelimumab PopPK models were used to obtains EBEs of individual PK parameters. 
Exposure-efficacy: 
The exposure-efficacy relationships in the HIMALAYA study were explored by Kaplan-Meier plots stratified 
by durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure quartiles. Several exposure metrics for tremelimumab and 
durvalumab  were  derived.  For  both  efficacy  outcomes,  OS  and  PFS,  Cox  Proportional  Hazard  (CPH) 
models  were  developed  and  a  stepwise  covariate  selection  was  performed  (α  =  1%  and  0.1%).  No 
significant  exposure-efficacy  relationships  were  identified  for  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab.  The  CPH 
models for OS suggested that AST and NLR were associated with shorter survival in T300+D arm as they 
were  identified  as  statistically  significant  covariates.  Maximum  concentration  following  the  first  dose 
(Cmax, dose 1) for tremelimumab was also identified as a marginally statistically significant exposure 
metric (LRT: 11.92 > 10.83) but was removed due to non-significance in the Wald test (p = 0.199), the 
standard error of coefficient (β) being large and the 95% CI of β containing the null. The removal of this 
covariate in the CPH model is considered appropriate. Likewise, trough concentration following the first 
dose (Cmin, dose 1) for tremelimumab was also identified as a marginally significant covariate within 
PFS based on the LRT but was removed for the same reasons. No other covariates were identified to be 
significant with PFS.  
Exposure-safety: 
Logistic  regression  modelling  did  not  identify  any  significant  impact  of  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab 
exposure on the incidence of adverse effects.

QTcF modelling analysis 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterize the 
relationship  of  change  from  baseline  of  QTcF  (ΔQTcF)  with  durvalumab  or  tremelimumab  serum 
concentrations.  The  concentration-ΔQTcF  analysis  population  consisted  of  293  observations  from  67 
patients administered durvalumab and 254 observations from 66 patients administered tremelimumab 
from  Study  06.  Unscheduled  concentration-QTcF  observations  and  non-central  ECG  records  were 
excluded from the analysis.  
For durvalumab, the slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to durvalumab concentration was 0.0048 ms per 
μg/mL (p = 0.112), with a mean intercept of 0.082 ms (p = 0.950; 90% CI: -2.07, 2.24 ms; Table 4). 
The slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to tremelimumab concentration was -0.012 ms per μg/mL (p = 
0.531), and the mean intercept was 0.581 ms (p = 0.629; 90% CI: -1.41, 2.57 ms; Table 5). 
The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were not significantly different from zero.  
Table 4: Parameter estimates of durvalumab PK-ΔQTcF relationship 
Table 5: Parameter estimates of Tremelimumab PK-ΔQTcF relationship 
The  upper  bound  of  the  90%  2-sided  CI  for  ΔQTcF  was  less  than  10  ms,  and  the  highest  observed 
concentration of durvalumab and tremelimumab had a predicted mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms (Figure 
3, Figure 4 and Table 6).

Absorption 
Durvalumab is administered intravenously and the bioavailability is 100 %. 
Distribution 
Distribution studies have not been conducted for durvalumab in the context of this application.  
In an analysis that included data from HIMALAYA, the typical CL and central volume of distribution for 
durvalumab were 0.277 L/day and 3.45 L, respectively. The values differ less than 10% from the values 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 27/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
derived for the model reported previously. The time-dependent clearance suggests that clearance could 
decrease by a maximum of 31%, which is also similar to the 39% in the previous model.  
Elimination 
No studies regarding durvalumab metabolism have been conducted.  
No new data has been provided from HIMALAYA on elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on the final Population PK model, time-dependent CL was identified for durvalumab in combination 
with tremelimumab.  
A faster clearance was observed in the low dose cohorts for durvalumab. A dose-proportional increase 
in Cmax over the dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg was observed following the first IV dose. 
Durvalumab clearance has been shown to decrease over time. 
For the durvalumab population PK model, estimates of inter-individual variability (CV%) were 29.9% on 
CL, 22.9% on V1 and 25.8% on Tmax. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
For the tremelimumab population PK model, estimates of inter-individual variability (CV%) were 32.9% 
on CL, 24.9% on V1, 46.0% on V2 and 119.2% on Tmax.   
For the durvalumab population PK model, estimates of inter-individual variability (CV%) were 29.9% on 
CL, 22.9% on V1 and 25.8% on Tmax. 
Special populations 
The  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  (i.e.,  race,  age,  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  sex,  and  body 
weight) on the PK of durvalumab has not been studied in specific dedicated studies. 
Based on pop PK analyses, albumin levels (ALB), creatinine clearance, ECOG status, LDH, gender, body 
weight, tumor types, and combination therapy were identified as statistically significant covariates on 
clearance. Body weight and gender had a statistically significant impact on central volume of distribution. 
However, none of the covariates were considered as clinically relevant, i.e. impact on durvalumab PK 
was less than or about 20% in univariate testing. Accordingly, no dose adjustment seems required in 
these special populations. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab or tremelimumab.  
PK drug-drug interaction of durvalumab or tremelimumab with other therapeutics is not anticipated 
given that durvalumab and tremelimumab are not primarily cleared via hepatic or renal pathways; 
instead, the primary elimination pathways are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system (RES) 
or target-mediated disposition. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not expected to induce or inhibit 
the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 pathways.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No  in  vitro  permeability,  in  vitro  metabolism,  or  in  vitro  metabolic  drug-drug  interaction  studies  that 
used human biomaterials have been performed. 
Immunogenicity 
In  HIMALAYA,  immunogenicity  data  were  available  from  684  durvalumab  ADA-evaluable  patients,  ie, 
those patients who had  non-missing baseline and at least 1 non-missing post-baseline ADA result for 
durvalumab. 
Table 7: Summary of ADA responses to durvalumab (safety analysis set) 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1k mAb that binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory 
signals  and  can  be  expressed  on  both  tumor  cells  and  tumor-associated  immune  cells  in  the  tumor 
microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interactions with PD-1 and CD80 
(B7.1).  By  binding  to  its  receptors  PD-L1  reduces  cytotoxic  T-cell  activity,  proliferation,  and  cytokine 
production.  Blockade  of  PD-L1/PD-1  and  PD-L1/CD80  interactions  releases  the  inhibition  of  immune 
responses, without inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Tremelimumab  is  a  human  IgG2  mAb  directed  against  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte-associated  antigen-4 
(CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T-cell expansion and activation following an immune 
response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that maintains T-cell homeostasis. During T-cell 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 29/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells, 
sending  an  inhibitory  signal  and  preventing  CD28-mediated  T-cell  co-stimulation,  thus  limiting  T-cell 
activation.  Tremelimumab  blocks  these  events,  leading  to  prolongation  and  enhancement  of  T-cell 
activation and expansion. 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of  action  with  respect  to  enhancing  the  antitumor  immune  response  triggered  by  chemotherapy. 
Tremelimumab  mediated  blockade  of  CTLA-4  functions  early  in  the  immune  response,  lowering  the 
threshold for T cell activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the T 
cell population. This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumor neoantigen can become 
activated. Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector phase of T 
cell function, once T cells enter the tumor, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell function by 
PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumor cells. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In  Study  06,  Study  10,  and  Study  22,  circulating  lymphocytes  (T,  B,  and  NK  cells)  and  proliferating 
(Ki67+) T cell subsets were quantified. 
The data for Study 06 and Study 10 demonstrated that 15 or 20 mg/kg Q4W durvalumab (combined 
with doses as low as 1 mg/kg Q4W of tremelimumab) result in significant elevations in proliferating CD4 
+  Ki67  +  T  cell  quantities,  demonstrating  a  pharmacodynamic  effect  consistent  with  the  proposed 
mechanisms of  action of both durvalumab and  tremelimumab. The  elevations in CD4 + Ki67  +  T cell 
quantities were dose-proportional to tremelimumab. Additionally, CD8 + Ki67 + T cells were elevated 
above pre-treatment levels. 
In Study 22, substantial and consistent increases in CD4 + Ki67 + T cells were observed in the T300 + 
D, T, and T75 + D treatment arms that were associated with increasing tremelimumab dose. Increases 
in CD8 + Ki67 + T cells were observed in all treatment arms and peaked on Day 15. Findings indicated 
a  potential  saturable  pharmacodynamic  effect  on  this  lymphocyte  population,  because  equivalent 
elevation  magnitudes  were  observed  in  the  T300  +  D  and  T  arms.  Among  all  monitored  lymphocyte 
populations, median CD8 + Ki67 + T cell counts from patients with complete or partial response were 
elevated at the highest levels above those of stable disease and PD patients. Pairwise analysis using the 
Wilcoxon method revealed significant differences between median CD8 + Ki67 + T cell counts in patients 
with complete or partial response vs stable disease or PD patients (p <0.01). 
In Study 1108, target engagement was assessed by measuring the reduction of free sPD-L1 in serum 
before and following durvalumab administration. sPD-L1 data were available from 851 patients in the 
dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion cohorts following administration of durvalumab 
0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 15 mg/kg Q3W, and 20 mg/kg Q4W, respectively. 
Mean baseline sPD-L1 was approximately 137 pg/mL (range: 67 to 681 pg/mL). Following administration 
of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg durvalumab, sPD-L1 concentrations were maximally suppressed at Day 14 (or after 
the first dose) for all doses except 0.1 mg/kg. The extent and duration of the suppression was dose-
dependent. Complete sPD-L1 suppression was observed around the dose levels at 0.3 mg/kg. Following 
10 mg/kg Q2W, approximately 97% of patients demonstrated complete sPD-L1 suppression throughout 
the dosing interval. 
Suppression  of  free  sPD-L1  was  similar  among  10  mg/kg  Q2W,  15  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  20  mg/kg  Q4W 
cohorts. 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 30/137 
 
 
  
 
 
Similar results were observed in Japan Study 02, where sPD-L1 was completely suppressed in all patients 
following administration of durvalumab 1, 3, 10 mg/kg Q2W; 15 mg/kg Q3W; and 20 mg/kg Q4W. 
Likewise,  suppression  of  free  sPD-L1  was  observed  following  treatment  with  the  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab combination in all study groups in Study 10 and in all but 3 patients in Study 06. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Overall,  concentration-QTc-analysis  did  not  identify  a  significant  linear  relationship  between 
tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. The predicted mean ΔQTcF and upper 
90% CI at the maximum observed concentration for tremelimumab or durvalumab in the dataset were 
below the threshold of clinical concern. See section QTcF modelling analysis under section 2.3.2 
Exposure-response-relationships 
Assessment  of  an  exposure-efficacy  relationship  was  conducted  using  overall  survival  (OS)  and 
progression-free  survival  (PFS)  as  efficacy  parameters  in  patients  from  HIMALAYA,  for  whom  the 
different exposure metrics could be calculated. 
For the exposure-response analysis for efficacy (OS and PFS), only the T300 + D cohort was used, but 
with the SoC cohort as a comparator in some of the analyses. The exposure-response Cox proportional-
hazards (CPH model) for OS and PFS was developed based on durvalumab and tremelimumab-treated 
patients in the HIMALAYA study. Simulated durvalumab and tremelimumab serum concentration-time 
PK profiles, based on individual post-hoc PK parameters, were used as a measure of exposure after T300 
+ D. 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
Overall survival (OS) 
The  data  for  OS  were  stratified  by  model-predicted  exposures  metrics  and  overlaid  with  data  from 
patients  in  the  SoC  arm.  There  were  6  exposure  metrics  used  for  durvalumab  (AUCdose  1,  Cmin,dose  1, 
Cmax,dose 1, AUCss, Cmin,ss, and Cmax,ss).  
Figure 5 and Figure 6 shows the OS Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots for exposure metrics of durvalumab. The 
number of patients at risk is indicated below each plot. The KM plots indicated that there was no clear 
relationship between efficacy and exposure to durvalumab with all quartiles overlapping each other.

The  covariates,  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR)  were 
identified as significant in the final model. Higher AST and NLR were associated with shorter survival in 
T300 + D arm, suggesting they are prognostic factors for OS. The OS Kaplan Meier plot stratified by 
these 2 significant covariates can be found in Figure 7. A Forest plot of the final CPH model for OS is

Exposure-safety relationship 
For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety  endpoints were Grade 3 and 
above treatment-related AEs from HIMALAYA, Grade 3 and above AESIs, and AEs leading to durvalumab 
treatment discontinuation.  
Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs 
The  probability  of  AEs  calculated  in  quartiles  of  the  AUCdose  1  exposure  metrics  for  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab is shown in Figure 10. This figure summarizes the logistic regression results assessing 
the impact of exposure on the probability of AEs. The p-values associated with exposure effects were 
relatively large, indicating that the relationship was not statistically significant.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of action with respect to enhancing the antitumor immune response. Tremelimumab mediated blockade 
of CTLA-4 functions early in the immune response, lowering the threshold for T cell activation, allowing 
more  T  cells  to  be  activated  and  increasing  the  diversity  of  the  T  cell  population.  This  increases  the 
probability that a T cell recognizing a tumor neoantigen can become activated. Durvalumab blockade of 
PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector phase of T cell function, once T cells enter the 
tumor,  where  it  acts  to  block  local  suppression  of  T-cell  function  by  PD-L1,  enhancing  the  ability  of 
activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumor cells. 
Durvalumab  (Imfinzi)  was  approved  in  2018  in  the  EU  for  treatment  of  adults  with  locally  advanced, 
unresectable  NSCLC,  whose  disease  has  not  progressed  following  platinum-based  chemoradiation 
therapy.  
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab as monotherapy has previously been described adequately. 
The  Applicant  is  currently  seeking  marketing  approval  for  the  use  of  a  durvalumab  (IMFINZI)  in 
combination with a single, priming dose of tremelimumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). 
The purpose of the present application is to update the product information for durvalumab administered 
in combination with tremelimumab for this indication. 
The  clinical  pharmacological  data  are  derived  from  1  pivotal  study  (HIMALAYA)  and  20  supportive 
durvalumab studies and 17 supportive tremelimumab studies. 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 39/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
All studies included male and female patients aged 18 years and older with advanced solid tumors. No 
PK data has been obtained from healthy volunteers. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  in  special  populations  is  considered  adequate  and  typical  for  a 
protein drug product being administered intravenously.  
The  effect  of  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  was  not  formally  tested  in  dedicated  clinical  trials;  this  is 
acceptable  since  durvalumab  is  a  human  IgG  antibody,  which  is  expected  to  be  degraded  into  small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same way as endogenous IgG. 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using OS and PFS as efficacy parameters 
in patients from HIMALAYA, for whom the different exposure metrics could be calculated. 
OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models.  
For  OS  the  KM  plots  indicated  that  there  was  no  clear  relationship  between  efficacy  and  exposure  to 
durvalumab with all quartiles overlapping each other.  
The  covariates,  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR)  were 
identified as significant in the final model. Higher AST and NLR were associated with shorter survival in 
T300 + D arm, suggesting they are prognostic factors for OS. 
For PFS the KM plots indicated no clear efficacy relationship to durvalumab exposure with all quartiles 
overlapping each other. Overall, no covariate was identified to be related with PFS in this analysis. 
Additional explorative analyses of the covariates, body weight, and ADA status for durvalumab exposure 
(data not shown) did not indicate any clear trend between OS or PFS and body weight or ADA status. 
However, the small number of ADA-positive patients after durvalumab treatment mean that the Kaplan-
Meier plots for ADA status should be interpreted with caution. 
For assessment of exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety endpoints were Grade 3 and above 
treatment-related adverse events (AEs) from HIMALAYA, Grade 3 and above Adverse event of special 
interest (AESIs) and AEs leading to durvalumab treatment discontinuation.  
None  of  the  tremelimumab  or  durvalumab  exposure  metrics  in  a  logistic  regression  analysis  were 
identified to have an influence on safety events.  
A body weight-AE analysis did not identify any clear trend between the probability of AEs and increasing 
or decreasing body weight. 
Both the ADA incidence and prevalence were similar across treatment arms (D, T300+D and T75+D), it 
is agreed that the presence of tremelimumab did not have an apparent effect on the immunogenicity of 
durvalumab. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab has overall been 
adequately described. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This  extension  of  indication  for  durvalumab  is  based  on  efficacy  data  from  HIMALAYA,  a  randomised, 
open-label, multicentre Phase III study in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not 
EMA/42902/2023

eligible  for  locoregional  therapy  and  with  no  prior  systemic  therapy  for  HCC.  Additional  supportive 
evidence of clinical efficacy is provided from study 22, a randomised, phase I/II, open-label study.

Enrollment into the T75+D arm was closed following protocol edition 4.0 (29 November 2018). Patients randomized 
to T75+D prior to protocol amendment 3 could continue on their assigned study treatment, provided the 
Investigator and patient agreed this was in the patient’s best interest. Patients randomized to T75+D arm who had 
not completed or started all 4 doses of tremelimumab could either complete the full schedule or continue with 
durvalumab monotherapy only  
Methods 
Study participants 
Patients  were  enrolled  at  181  sites  and  randomized  at  170  study  centers  in  16  countries:  Brazil  (13 
centers),  Canada  (9),  France  (14),  Germany  (10),  Hong  Kong  (5),  India  (10),  Italy  (8),  Japan  (27), 
South Korea (8), Russian Federation (10), Spain (6), Taiwan (9), Thailand (9), Ukraine (8), United States 
of America (21), and Vietnam (3). 
Inclusion Criteria 
For inclusion in the study, patients had to fulfill all of the following criteria: 
1. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of screening. 
2. Body weight > 30 kg. 
3.  Written  informed  consent  and  any  locally  required  authorization  obtained  from  the  patient/legal 
representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations. 
4. Confirmed HCC based on histopathological findings from tumor tissues. 
5. Must not have received prior systemic therapy for HCC. 
6.  Ineligible  for  locoregional  therapy  for  unresectable  HCC.  For  patients  who  progressed  after 
locoregional  therapy  for  HCC,  locoregional  therapy  must  have been  completed  ≥  28  days  prior  to  the 
baseline scan for the current study. 
7. BCLC stage B (ie, not eligible for locoregional therapy) or stage C. 
8. Child-Pugh score class A. 
9. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at enrollment. 
10. Patients with HBV infection, characterized by positive HBsAg and/or anti-HBcAb with detectable HBV 
DNA (≥ 10 IU/mL or above the limit of detection per local or central laboratory standard), must be treated

IU/mL) prior to enrollment. Patients were to remain on antiviral therapy for the study duration and for 
6 months after the last dose of study treatment. Patients who tested positive for HBc with undetectable 
HBV DNA (< 10 IU/mL or under the limit of detection per local or central laboratory standard) did not 
require antiviral therapy prior to enrollment. These patients were tested at every cycle to monitor HBV 
DNA levels and antiviral therapy initiated if HBV DNA was detected (≥ 10 IU/mL or above the limit of 
detection  per  local  or  central  laboratory  standard).  HBV  DNA  detectable  patients  were  to  initiate  and 
remain on antiviral therapy for the study duration and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.

Treatments 
Table 9. Study Treatments 
The  proposed  dosing  regimen  for  the  relevant  arm  for  this  procedure  (T300+D,  arm  C)  is  new  and 
encompasses one single initial dose of tremelimumab 300 mg in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg 
and thereafter, durvalumab monotherapy iv Q4W until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
The relevant comparator arm for the current procedure  was  the standard of care arm (SOC, arm D), 
which contains sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily as standardly dosed, and treatment should have also 
been given until PD or unacceptable toxicity. No cross-over was allowed. 
The two other treatment arms with D (durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, arm A) and T75+D (tremelimumab 
75 mg Q4W × 4 doses + durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W, arm B) 
are not of relevance for this procedure. 
It  is  noted  that  although  the  combination  of  a  CTLA-4  inhibitor,  such  as  tremelimumab,  and  an 
immunecheckpoint inhibitor such as durvalumab is not new, it is the first time that the anti-CTLA-4 is 
given only as an induction dose and then monotherapy with durvalumab is continued until PD. Moreover, 
the already  approved combination therapy with ipilimumab +  nivolumab differs as nivolumab is PD-1 
inhibitor, while durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor. 
The Applicant claims that pharmacodynamic results reported for tremelimumab and durvalumab in Study 
006 suggest that the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-CTLA-4 are mainly associated with the first dosing 
cycle and subside in subsequent cycles regardless of dose. Moreover, these results led to the hypothesis 
that a single dose of tremelimumab might accomplish similar pharmacodynamic effects as seen in Study 
006  and  also  seen  for  ipilimumab,  while  also  limiting  the  toxicity  associated  with  the  second  (and 
subsequent) anti-CTLA-4 dosing cycles.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Please refer to Table 10 above regarding the objectives and endpoints for the pivotal study Himalaya.  
Sample size 
This  study  was  planned  to  screen  approximately  1650  patients,  with  no  prior  systemic  therapy  for 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  and  not  eligible  for  locoregional  therapy,  in  order  to  randomize 
approximately  1310  patients.  (This  included  1155  patients  randomized  to  Arms  A  (Durvalumab 
monotherapy), C (T300+D), D (S) with 385 per arm; and approximately 155 patients in Arm B (T75+D), 
randomized prior to the closure of this arm). The study was sized to characterize the OS benefit 
of Arm C vs. Arm D (T300+D vs S).  
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 48/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The sample size estimation assumed an exponentially distributed OS and a 2-month delay in separation 
of the OS curves for Arm C vs. Arm D. A non-uniform accrual of patients with a duration of 22 months 
was assumed when estimating the analysis times. 
For the efficacy comparisons, the median OS for sorafenib (Arm D) was assumed to be 11.5 months, 
with an 18-month OS rate of 33.8%. 
Durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 300 mg × 1 dose (Arm C) versus sorafenib 400 mg BID (Arm 
D) (OS in FAS [ITT]) 
The assumed OS treatment effect was an average HR of 0.70 for Arm C versus Arm D. This translates 
to an increase in median OS from 11.5 months to 16.5 months, and in the 18-month OS rate from 33.8% 
to 46.8% in Arm C versus Arm D. Final analysis of OS was planned to be performed when approximately 
515 events in Arm C and Arm D combined (~67% maturity) have occurred. This number of OS events 
was foreseen to provide 97% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in OS at a 2-
sided 4.25% significance level. The smallest treatment difference that could be observed as statistically 
significant at the final analysis  was foreseen to be an average HR of 0.84 (an increase in median OS 
from 11.5 months to 13.7 months in Arm C versus Arm D). 
No formal sample size calculations were associated with the analyses planned for IA1. However, global 
enrollment was required to be completed prior to the DCO for IA1. 
There were 2 IAs  and a FA  planned for  HIMALAYA.  Any major changes to the planned analyses were 
addressed in protocol amendments finalized prior to the date of the first DCO for Interim analysis 1 for 
ORR (02 September 2019). These changes were informed by the open-label Study 22 and study read-
outs from external studies in the same disease area, including KEYNOTE-240 and CheckMate-459. No 
HIMALAYA data were available for use to modify the protocol design or statistical analysis plan. 
The sample size calculations were updated several times while the study was ongoing. Major changes 
were implemented in the Protocol version 4 (29 Nov 2018) and in Protocol version 6 (20 Aug 2019). In 
protocol version 4, the arm durvalumab + tremelimumab 75 mg was closed due to unfavourable results 
obtained in the supportive Study 22. At this point, the sample size for the remaining arms was increased 
to 385 and the number of required events at the second interim analysis and at the final analysis was 
changed. In protocol version 6, the median OS and 18-month OS rate for sorafenib was increased from 
10 months and 28.7 % to 11.5 months and 33.8 %, respectively. The required number of events at the 
second interim analysis and at the final analysis were also changed.  
The Applicant claimed that the changes made in the protocol and SAP were solely informed by external 
data including Study 22 and KEYNOTE-240 and CheckMate-459. Nevertheless, changes in the sample 
size while the study is ongoing can jeopardize the interpretation of the results since they may alter the 
behavior of study participants and personnel. The changes were implemented between 1 and 2 years 
from study start, and one month before the first interim analysis (2 Sep 2019). Therefore, the sample 
size calculations are not considered relevant and the study results were assessed based on the size of 
the confidence intervals. 
Randomisation  
Subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 4 arms: 
1) Arm A: Durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy 
2) Arm B: Tremelimumab 75 mg × 4 doses plus Durvalumab 1500 mg combination therapy 
3) Arm C: Tremelimumab 300 mg × 1 dose plus Durvalumab 1500 mg combination therapy 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 49/137 
 
 
  
 
 
4) Arm D: Sorafenib 400 mg BID. 
Protocol amendment 4 closed enrolment to Arm B. As a result of protocol amendment 4, subjects were 
randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  Arm  A,  Arm  C  and  Arm  D.  Subjects  randomized  to  Arm  B  prior  to 
amendment 4 could have remained on study as planned until discontinuation criteria were met at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
Randomization  was  foreseen  to  be  stratified  according  to  macrovascular  invasion  (yes  versus  no), 
etiology  of  liver  disease  (hepatitis  B  virus  [confirmed  HBV]  versus  hepatitis  C  virus  [confirmed  HCV] 
versus others), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1). 
A randomization list was produced for each of the randomization stratum. A blocked randomization was 
generated,  and  all  centers  used  the  same  list  in  order  to  minimize  any  imbalance  in  the  number  of 
patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study  was open-label.  The Study Team,  responsible for  the  conduct of  the study,  was  blinded to 
randomized treatment assignment until formal study unblinding occured at Interim Analysis 2 (IA2) or 
the Final Analysis (FA). The Study Team members were not planned to have access to any information 
regarding  the  interim  analysis  results.  If  a  Study  Team  member  was  needed  to  join  the  Submission 
Team, this member was not allowed to re-join the Study Team until the Study Team and Study Database 
are  formally  unblinded  at  IA2  or  FA.  This  study  used  an  external  IDMC  that  comprised  independent 
therapeutic  area  experts  and  biostatisticians  to  assess  ongoing  safety  as  well  as  the  interim  efficacy 
analyses. The IDMC remit was to report to the Sponsor and if applicable recommend changes to study 
conduct. 
Measures were in place to ensure that the Study team was blinded to treatment assignment and results 
from the interim analyses. An IDMC assessed safety data ongoing and performed the interim analyses.  
Statistical methods 
Full analysis set 
The full analysis set (FAS) was planned to include all randomized patients, including patients who were 
randomized  in  error.  The  FAS  was  planned  to  be  used  for  all  efficacy  analyses  (including  PROs). 
Treatment arms were to be compared on the basis of randomized study drug(s), regardless of the study 
drug(s) actually received. Patients who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study 
drug(s) were included in the analysis in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
For IA1 an additional analysis set was planned to be defined: FAS subjects with an opportunity for 32 
weeks of follow up at the time of IA1 (FAS-32w, i.e., randomized ≥ 32 weeks prior to IA1 DCO). 
The primary analysis was performed using the FAS, which includes all randomized patients. For the first 
IA, only subjects who had the opportunity to attend at least 32 weeks of follow-up were included. The 
results of the first IA are not related to the primary objectives of the study.

Statistical analyses 
Table 11. Formal Statistical Analyses to be Conducted and Pre-planned Sensitivity 
Overall survival 
The primary OS endpoint was to be analysed using a stratified log-rank tests adjusting for etiology of 
liver  disease  (confirmed  HBV  versus  confirmed  HCV  versus  others),  ECOG  (0  versus  1),  and 
macrovascular invasion (yes versus no) for generation of the p-value and using rank tests for association

as the testing approach, which corresponds to Cox regression with the Breslow approach for handling 
ties (Breslow, 1974).  
The effect of Arm C vs. Arm D treatment was to be estimated by the HR from stratified Cox proportional 
hazards  model  (with  ties=Efron  and  stratification  variables  as  listed  above)  together  with  its 
corresponding  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  calculated  using  a  profile  likelihood  approach.  The 
stratification variable used the values recorded in the randomization system (IWRS).  
If there is >10% discordance in stratification factors as recorded in IWRS versus the Case Report Form 
(CRF),  then  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  OS  was  to  be  performed  using  CRF  based 
stratification factors. 
Secondary  OS  analyses  were  to  be  performed  using  the  same  methodology  as  for  primary  analysis 
described above. 
Censoring rules for OS 
Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis was planned to be censored based on the 
last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. 
Assumptions of Proportionality 
The  assumption  of  proportionality  of  hazard  was  to  be  assessed  first  by  examining  plots  of 
complementary log-log (event times) versus log (time) and, if these raise concerns, by fitting a time-
dependent  covariate  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  this  represents  random  variation.  If  a  lack  of 
proportionality of hazard is evident, the variation in treatment effect was to be described by presenting 
piecewise  HR  calculated  over  distinct  time  periods.  The  Grambsch-Therneau  test  and  Schoenfeld 
residuals may have also been used to check violation of the proportional hazards assumption. As a lack 
of  proportionality  was  expected  (due  to  delayed  effect  in  IO  agents),  a  three-component  stratified 
MaxCombo test was planned to be used as a sensitivity analysis with the same stratification factors as 
the  primary  analysis.  The  Restricted  Mean  Survival  Time  (RMST)  was  also  to  be  analysed  up  to  the 
minimum of the largest observed event time in each of the two arms and /or suitable clinically relevant 
timepoint. In addition, an area-under-the-curve approach (Kaplan-Meier method) and Royston-Parmar 
model (Royston and Parmar 2011, 2013) may also have been used. 
Sensitivity analysis  
•  Censoring patterns: A sensitivity analysis for OS was planned to examine the censoring patterns 
to  rule  out  attrition  bias,  achieved  by  a  Kaplan-Meier  plot  of  time-to-censoring  where  the 
censoring indicator of OS was reversed. 
• 
Impact  of  switching  (crossover  outside  of  this  study)  to  other  immunotherapies  (or  other 
potentially active investigational agents) on OS analyses: Exploratory analyses of OS adjusting 
for the impact of subsequent switching of immunotherapy or the investigational treatment may 
have been performed, if a sufficient proportion of subjects switched. 
• 
Effect of COVID-19: A sensitivity analysis was planned to be conducted to assess for the potential 
impact of COVID deaths on OS. This was to be assessed by repeating the OS analysis except 
that any subject who had a death with primary/secondary cause as COVID-19 Infection was to 
be censored at their COVID infection death date. 
• 
Effect of covariates on the HR estimate: Cox proportional hazards modelling was to be employed 
to assess the effect of pre-specified covariates on the HR estimate for the primary OS treatment 
comparisons. As an exploratory analysis, the covariates from the model in the primary analysis 
and the model containing additional covariates may have been presented.

OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36 
OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36 were to be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months, 18 
months, 24 months, and 36 months. OS12, OS18, OS24, and OS36, along with their 95% CI, were to 
be summarized (using the Kaplan- Meier curve) and presented by treatment arm. An analysis of OS36 
was to be performed to compare Arm C vs. Arm D using a stratified chisquare test for the difference in 
KM estimators (cloglog transformed) for Arms C and D at a fixed time point (36 months). The test was 
to be conducted using the methods described in (Klein et al., 2007), including cloglog transformation on 
KM  estimators,  with  randomization  stratification  factors  (macrovascular  invasion,  etiology  of  liver 
disease, and ECOG). Note that the adjustment for the stratification factors was planned to be applied 
only if there were sufficient number of events and subjects at risk available in each strata at 36 months. 
Otherwise, an unstratified chisquare test was to be used to compare the difference in KM estimators at 
36 months. 
OS was analysed using a stratified log-rank tests adjusting for the factors used at randomization: etiology 
of  liver  disease  (confirmed  HBV  versus  confirmed  HCV  versus  others),  ECOG  (0  versus  1),  and 
macrovascular invasion (yes versus no). The HR was to be estimated using a stratified Cox model. The 
fulfilment  of  the  proportional  hazard  assumption  was  investigated  using  a  graphical  approach  and  a 
maxcombo test. Sensitivity analyses were planned to explore the impact of treatment switch, covid 19 
and  effect  of  covariates.  Censoring  patterns  were  examined  using  the  reverse  Kaplan-Meier  method. 
Patients not known to have died were censored at the last observation date.  
The statistical method implemented to analysis OS is overall endorsed. The Applicant has clarified that 
the  concordance  rate  between  stratification  factors  entered  in  the  IWRS  vs  eCRF  at  screening  and 
baseline is high and due to <10% discordance rate, the threshold for triggering the sensitivity analysis 
was  not  met.  Hence,  no  sensitivity  analysis  for  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  OS  adjusted  for  eCRF 
stratification factors at baseline has been conducted, which is acceptable. 
Objective response rate based on Investigator assessment (ORR) 
Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, was 
planned to be included in the assessment of ORR. Subjects who went off treatment without progression, 
received a subsequent therapy, and then responded were planned not be included as responders in the 
ORR. ORR based on at least one confirmed response will also be derived and reported in CSR. 
Logistic  regression  models  adjusting  for  the  same  factors  as  the  primary  endpoint  (etiology  of  liver 
disease, ECOG, and macrovascular invasion) was planned to be fitted. The results of the analysis were 
planned to be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI 
(e.g. using the option ‘LRCI’ in SAS procedure GENMOD) and p-value (based on twice the change in log-
likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model). 
Additionally, at IA2 and FA a stratified Cochran Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test was planned to be performed 
using randomization stratification factors (macrovascular invasion, etiology of liver disease, and ECOG). 
CMH test results were foreseen to include odds ratios and p-values. 
Progression Free Survival by Investigator (PFS) 
Analysis of PFS (time to first progression) was planned to be performed to compare Arm C vs. Arm D 
and Arm A vs. Arm D using the same methodology as for OS. Exploratory analyses compared Arm A vs. 
Arm C.

Interim analyses 
Two interim analyses and a final analysis were planned as described below: 
Interim  Analysis  1  (IA1):  The  first  interim  analysis  was  planned  to  be  performed  after  approximately 
100 subjects per treatment arm have had the opportunity for 32 weeks of follow-up and not prior to the 
last subject enrolled. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Arm A and Arm C in terms of ORR 
and DoR. The analysis set for ORR and DoR were the FAS-32wA. BICR of radiological scans were to be 
performed on all subjects included in IA1 who have been randomized and have had the opportunity for 
at  least  32  weeks  follow-up.  Both  Investigator  (using  RECIST  1.1)  and  BICR  (using  RECIST  1.1  and 
mRECIST)  assessments  were  planned  for  IA1.  Therefore,  ORR  and  DoR  (for  both  confirmed  and 
unconfirmed responses) according to both  Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and BICR using RECIST 1.1 
and mRECIST were reported for IA1. 
Interim Analysis 2 (IA2): The second interim analysis was planned to be performed when approximately 
404 OS events in Arm C and Arm D combined (~52% maturity), approximately 30 months after the first 
subject was randomized. The goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Arm C vs. Arm D (for superiority) and 
then  Arm  A  vs.  Arm  D  (for  non-inferiority,  then  superiority)  in  terms  of  OS.  It  is  anticipated  that 
approximately 453 OS events would have occurred across Arms A and D combined (~59% maturity) at 
the time of the DCO for IA2. 
Final Analysis (FA): The final analysis was expected to be performed when approximately 515 OS events 
in Arm C and Arm D combined (~67% maturity), approximately 37.5 months after the first subject was 
randomized. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of Arm C vs. Arm D in terms of OS for 
superiority. The key secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of Arm A vs. Arm D in terms of OS 
(for non-inferiority, then superiority). It was anticipated that approximately 560 OS events would have 
occurred across Arms A and D combined (~73% maturity) at the time of the DCO for the final analysis. 
Efficacy  data  for  Arm  B  (which  was  closed  for  enrollment  with  Amendment  4)  were  planned  to  be 
summarized descriptively, however were not be formally analysed. 
Multiplicity 
To strongly control the familywise error rate (FWER) at the 5% level (2-sided), an alpha level of 0.1% 
was planned to be spent on the interim ORR analysis (IA1) while the remaining 4.9% alpha level were 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 54/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
planned to be spent on all OS analyses. The primary objective of OS was to be tested (H1: Arm C vs. 
Arm D) with 4.9% for this comparison. 
Since two analyses of OS were planned (Interim Analysis, Final Analysis), the Lan DeMets approach (Lan 
and DeMets 1983) that approximates the O’Brien and Fleming spending function was planned to be used 
to maintain an overall 2-sided 4.9% type I error across the two planned analyses of OS (Interim and 
Final) for the primary comparison (H1: Arm C vs. Arm D). 
If all the OS analyses (H1, H2, and H3) were considered successful (superiority tests were statistically 
significant  and  non-inferiority  was  achieved),  the  4.9%  alpha  level  were  to  be  passed  to  test  the 
difference in the three-year survival rates (OS36) between Arm C and Arm D; otherwise, the test would 
not have been conducted. The study was to be considered positive (a success) if the primary OS analysis 
result was statistically significant at either IA2 or FA. If significance was achieved at IA2, it did not need 
to be tested again at FA. 
Figure 13. Multiple testing strategy 
The MAH planned to perform 2 interim and 1 final analyses. The first interim analysis was planned to be 
performed after 100 subjects per treatment arm have had the opportunity for 32 weeks of follow-up. 
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Arm A and Arm C in terms of ORR and DoR. This analysis was 
not related to the primary objective of the study. The second interim analysis was related to OS and 
planned to be performed after 404 OS events were observed (~52% maturity). The final OS analysis 
was  planned  to  be  performed  after  515  OS  events  (~67%  maturity)  had  been  observed.  The  MAH 
implemented a hierarchical approach to protect the type I error due to multiple hypotheses being tested 
(OS superiority for T300+D vs S, OS non-inferiority for D vs S, OS superiority D vs S). An inflation of 
the type I error due to multiple looks was avoided using an alpha spending function.  
The implemented strategy to control the type I error is endorsed. Of note, the results presented in the 
CSR corresponds to the final analysis for OS. 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
Changes to the statistical analyses planned are shown in Table 13. The AstraZeneca study team was 
responsible for all changes to the planned statistical analyses. All major changes were made prior to 
the DBL for the final analysis (DCO: 27 August 2021) (data not shown). Minor changes to the 
algorithms for counting the number of dose delays for S and for determination of analysis windows for 
T and D were made after the SAP was finalized.

There are 4 versions of the SAP: SAP edition 1 (25 Oct 2017), SAP edition 2 (23 Aug 2019), SAP 
edition 3 (15 May 2020), and SAP edition 4 (30 July 2021). Several amendments were done to the 
study protocol throughout the study and the SAP was therefore updated. Major changes to the study 
design were made in Protocol version 5 (20 Aug 2019) where the objectives of the study, primary 
endpoints and the testing hierarchy were modified.

Of 1950 patients enrolled in the pivotal study, 61 were rescreened and 1324 were randomized to 1 of 
the 4 original treatment arms. The Applicant has clarified that of the 687 non-randomized patients, 654 
did  not  fulfil  eligibility  criteria  and  33  were  not  randomized  due  to  other  reasons.  The  screen  failure 
reasons of these 33 patients as collected as free text field in CRF are summarized in Table 16: 10/33 
patients  were  not  randomized  due  to  inability  to  complete  screening  procedures  within  the  28-day 
window, 6/33 withdrew informed consent or failed to return to clinic, 2/33 were unable to provide the 
required  tumor  tissue  sample,  and  2/33  died  prior  to  randomization.  In  addition,  9/33  did  not  report 
more  specific  screen  failure  reasons.  Other  reasons  were  reported  in  1  patient  each  and  included 
insurance coverage issues, incorrect screening, inability to verify eligibility, or local issues with sorafenib 
supply.  The  clarification  is  accepted,  and  the  screen  failure  reasons  are  in  line  with  what  could  be 
expected for a clinical trial with the targeted patient population.  
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 11 October 2017 and the last patient on 19 June 2019. The median 
follow-up for OS at DCO (27 August 2021) was ~33 months in the T300+D arm and ~32 months in the 
S arm.

a 
In HIMALAYA, patients were enrolled only if they had BCLC Stage B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) or Stage C. In 
Study 22, BCLC Stage was not specified in the inclusion criteria and collection of BCLC scores was not mandated at 
screening until protocol amendment 3 (20 July 2017); as a result, baseline BCLC scores were missing for some patients in 
Part 2A (see Section 9.2.2, Study 22 CSR, Module 5.3.5.2). 
Includes all patients with “MVI = Yes and EHS = No/Missing,” “MVI = No/Missing and EHS = Yes,” and “MVI = Yes 
b 
and EHS = Yes.” 
c 
PD-L1 expression level was defined as “Positive” if PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumor cell membranes and/or tumor-
associated immune cells covered ≥ 1% of tumor area (TIP ≥ 1%), and “Negative” if PD-L1 staining of any intensity in 
tumor cell membranes and/or tumor-associated immune cells covered < 1% of tumor area (TIP < 1%). 
d 
Per inclusion criteria, no patients in HIMALAYA received prior systemic therapy for HCC (first-line setting only). In Study 
22, patients were required to be immunotherapy-naïve and had either progressed on, were intolerant to, or have refused 
treatment with sorafenib or another approved VEGFR TKI (first-line and second-line settings).

Per inclusion criteria, no patients in HIMALAYA received prior systemic therapy for HCC (first-line setting 
only).  Overall,  the  most  common  disease-related  medical  procedures  prior  to  study  entry,  including 
ablative  therapy,  therapeutic  embolization,  regional  chemotherapy,  and  HCC-related  surgery,  were 
similar across treatment arms and consistent with that typically seen in the target patient population. 
In  study  22,  the  prior  anticancer  treatment  modalities  reported  were  prior  treatment  with 
sorafenib/VEGFR  TKI  (55/75  patients,  73.3%).  Most  patients  had  undergone  prior  TACE  or  RFA  Per 
protocol, all patients were immunotherapy-naïve.

The HR was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for treatment arm, etiology of liver disease (HBV vs 
HCV vs all others), ECOG (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). An HR < 1 favors either the T300+D arm or the D arm compared with 
the S arm in terms of being associated with a longer OS. 
T300+D vs S (primary objective in HIMALAYA). Statistical significance for T300+D vs S was based on a 2-sided interim 
p < 0.0419 (overall alpha 4.9%), as defined in the MTP. 
D vs S (key secondary objective in HIMALAYA). The non-inferiority margin for D vs S was 1.08, as defined in the MTP. 
The analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for treatment arm, etiology of liver disease (HBV vs HCV 
vs all others), ECOG (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Patients confirmed alive in follow-up or on active study treatment at the time of final analysis reported “study completion” on 
the disposition CRF. 
Includes patients with unknown survival status or patients who were lost to follow-up. 
Median for duration of follow-up is the arithmetic median. 
Calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier technique (with censor indicator reversed).

Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. 
Patients who had not progressed or died, or who progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, were censored at the latest 
evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment, or Day 1 if there were no evaluable visits. Patients who have no evaluable visits or baseline 
data were censored at Day 1 unless they died within 2 visits of baseline. Patients who die without tumor progression will be 
censored at the time of death. 
Progression determined by Investigator assessment. Lost to follow-up is defined as patients who have no RECIST 1.1 progression or 
death at the time of the DCO and have a termination status of 'Lost to follow-up' from the Disposition module. Withdrawn consent is 
defined as patients who have no RECIST 1.1 progression or death at the time of DCO and whose termination status is 'Withdrawn 
consent' on the Disposition module. The analysis methods used to obtain the hazard ratio, confidence interval, and 2-sided p-value 
are the same as for the primary OS analysis. 
A hazard ratio of < 1 favours IO treatment arms to be associated with a longer progression-free survival than sorafenib.

HR < 1 favors the IO treatment arm. 
HR and 95% CI were estimated from an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only covariate and 
using the Efron method to control for ties. 
HR and 95% CI were estimated from a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for treatment, etiology of liver disease (HBV 
vs HCV vs others), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and MVI (yes vs no). 
PD-L1 expression level is based on the TIP score method as: PD-L1 Positive (TIP ≥ 1%) or PD-L1 Negative (TIP < 1%). The TIP 1% 
cut-off is the only validated cut-off at which HIMALAYA patient samples were read. Additional PD-L1 TIP cut-offs of 5% and 10% 
should be interpreted in an exploratory manner.

Sensitivity analyses 
Non-proportional hazards 
Some evidence of delayed treatment effect was observed as illustrated by the lack of parallel lines in the 
log-log(survival) against log(time from randomization to death) for the individual treatment arms (Figure 
19). This was also noted in the survival curves with D vs S (separation at 9 months) and T300+D vs S 
(separation  at  4  months).  This  finding  is  expected,  as  IO  agents  have  illustrated  delayed  treatment 
effects in clinical settings. The assumption of non-proportionality was rigorously assessed with a post 
hoc  analysis  performed  to  test  the  linear  interaction  between  treatment  and  time,  and  no  significant 
interaction was found (T300+D vs S: nominal p = 0.094, D vs S: nominal p = 0.34).

Inversed Censoring 
The reverse KM survival curve shown in Figure 20 is constructed by reversing the “censor” and “event” 
of the standard KM curve (data not shown). Figure 20 shows that the curves for arms D, T300+D and S 
remain close to 1 for the first 26 months post randomization, indicating nearly complete follow-up for 
this period of time. No meaningful difference in the length of follow-up among arms D, T300+D and S 
can be seen in the figure, which is also evidenced by similar median follow-up times in censored patients 
(D: 31.61 months, T300+D: 32.36 months, and S: 30.36 months).

Additional sensitivity analyses following inaccurate survival information at site 6208  
GCP findings from the PMDA concerning the HIMALAYA trial, indicated that survival information was 
inaccurate for 4 subjects at site 6208. Following question regarding this issue, the supplementary 
analysis of OS with the corrected data was provided.

In total the site 6208 enrolled 14 patients in HIMALAYA study. Overall survival data for 4/14 enrolled 
patients was affected, and no discrepancies in survival information were identified for the remaining 
10/14 patients after onsite review.

Figure 21. KM Plot of OS by Removing Site 6208 (Full Analysis Set) 
The Applicant has provided the requested sensitivity analysis, using the most conservative approach by 
removing all 14 patients enrolled at this site and this showed that the OS HR was of 0.77 (95%CI: 
0.65, 0.91) for T300+D vs. S comparison, which is the main scope of the current procedure. There is 
overall consistency between the sensitivity analysis and the primary analysis, which is considered 
reassuring.

In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
PD-L1 testing 
The  relationship  between  PD-L1  expression  level  and  clinical  outcomes  (eg,  OS,  PFS,  and  ORR)  was 
investigated, and the results are presented by treatment arm. 
PD-L1 expression was determined by the analytically validated VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay using the 
TIP score method. The TIP score was defined as the total percentage of the tumor area covered by tumor 
cells  with  PD-L1  membrane  staining  at  any  intensity  and/or  tumor-associated  immune  cells  with  any 
pattern of PD-L1 staining at any intensity. Two PD-L1 expression subgroups were defined: 
• 
PD-L1  TIP  ≥  1%  (Positive):  PD-L1  staining  of  any  intensity  in  tumour  cell  membranes  and/or 
tumour-associated immune cells covering ≥ 1% of the tumor area 
• 
PD-L1 TIP < 1% (Negative): PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumour cell membranes and/or 
tumour-associated immune cells covering < 1% of the tumor area. 
Collection of patient samples for analysis of PD-L1 expression 
Patients were strongly encouraged to provide a fresh tissue biopsy for the purpose of PD-L1 expression 
analyses at screening. The tumour specimen submitted to the central laboratory for PD-L1 expression 
analysis should be of sufficient quantity and quality (with pathology quality control) to allow for PD-L1 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Newly acquired or archived specimens with limited tumour content 
and fine needle aspirates were not acceptable for defining tumour PD-L1 expression. 
•  MANDATORY:  Provision  of  a  tumour  biopsy,  formalin  fixed  and  embedded  in  paraffin,  for  the 
purpose of PD-L1 expression analyses (and for enabling exploratory analyses as described in the 
proceeding  section).  A  newly  acquired  tumor  biopsy  (<3  months)  was  strongly  preferred; 
however, if not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk, an archival sample taken ≤3 years prior 
to  screening  could  have  been  submitted.  Note:  the  tumor  biopsy  was  optional  for  the  China 
cohort. 
•  Samples should have been collected via an image-guided core needle (at least 18 gauge) or an 
excisional  archival  tumour  biopsy  sample.  Where  institutional  practice,  in  this  setting,  uses  a 
smaller gauge needle, samples should have been submitted with tissue adequate to ensure that 
a valid result can be achieved (ie, total tissue quantity submitted should have been similar to 
core needle or excisional biopsy requirements). 
•  When fresh tissue was obtained, 2 cores should have been placed in formalin and processed to 
a single paraffin-embedded block. It was anticipated that 4 passes of an 18 gauge core needle 
would provide sufficient tissue for both PD-L1 analyses and exploratory analyses as described 
below. Tumour lesions used for fresh biopsies should not have been the same lesions used as 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 86/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
RECIST 1.1 TLs, unless there were no other lesions suitable for biopsy, and in this instance, only 
core  needle  (not  excisional/incisional)  biopsy  was  allowed.  For  patients  with  a  single  TL,  if 
screening  biopsy  was  collected  prior  to  screening  imaging  for  baseline  tumour  assessment, 
allowed approximately 2 weeks before imaging scans were acquired. 
•  OPTIONAL:  Additional  archived  tumour  tissue  block  (formalin  fixed  and  paraffin  embedded), 
where such samples exist in a quantity sufficient to allow for analysis. Tumour tissue block was 
preferred.  If  a  tissue  block  was  unavailable,  unstained  sections  from  the  tissue  block  may  be 
submitted.  
•  OPTIONAL: Tumour biopsy at the time of progression was requested 
•  OPTIONAL: Additional tumour biopsies collected as part of clinical care (eg, for mixed responses 
or upon PD) could have been submitted for further analysis. 
•  Additional archived tissue not intended for PD-L1 testing, and optional biopsies obtained at the 
time of progression or part of clinical care were not to be collected in China. Additionally, China 
study sites were not to submit tumour tissue blocks and only unstained sections from the tissue 
block were to be submitted for analysis. 
• 
The  Ventana  SP263  IHC assay  was  to  be  used  to determine  PD-L1  expression  in  all  available 
specimens.  To  meet  the  requirement  of  the  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  for 
approval  of  a  companion  diagnostic,  sections  of  the  tumour  were  to  be  retained  at  Ventana 
and/or at the Investigation Use only testing laboratory for potential additional studies to support 
potential test approval. 
The Ventana SP163 PD-L1 assay was validated as an appropriate method for the selection of patients 
who would obtain benefit from durvalumab monotherapy in the PACIFIC trial, whose outcome led to the 
PD-L1 restricted indication of this anti-PD-L1 product in the locally advanced unresectable NSCLC setting 
after chemoradiotherapy. Thus, the choice of PD-L1 assay is acceptable.

Following protocol amendment 5, enrollment into the T75+D arm in Part 3 was closed. Patients already randomized to T75+D could 
continue on assigned study treatment (provided the Investigator and patient thought it in the best interests of the patient) until 
confirmed progressive disease or any other discontinuation criteria were met. Weight-based dosing regimen was used in Parts 2A; 
fixed-dosing regimens were used in Part 2B and Part 3 (durvalumab only).

Study 22 was a randomized, multicenter, international, open-label, multipart study designed to evaluate 
the  safety,  tolerability,  and  clinical  activity  of  durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  administered  as 
monotherapy,  and  durvalumab  in  combination  with  tremelimumab  or  bevacizumab,  in  patients  with 
advanced HCC. The study was comprised of multiple parts but only Parts 2 and 3 of Study 22 are relevant 
for this procedure.   
The primary objectives of Parts 2 and 3 were to: 
•  Assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  administered  as 
monotherapy and durvalumab administered in combination with tremelimumab to subjects with 
advanced HCC.  
The secondary objectives were to: 
• 
Evaluate  the  efficacy  of  durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  administered  as  monotherapy  and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced HCC. 
• 
Evaluate the relationship between baseline and pharmacodynamic biomarkers and measures of 
clinical  outcomes  of  durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  administered  as  monotherapy,  and 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced HCC. 
The final analysis of data in all study parts was performed 12 months after the first dose of investigational 
product was given to the last patient enrolled in the study (DCO: 06 November 2020). 
Patient population 
In Study 22, eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years (≥ 20 years for Japanese patients) with advanced 
HCC confirmed pathologically or with non-invasive methods. This study enrolled immunotherapy-naïve 
patients who progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused treatment with sorafenib or another approved 
VEGFR TKI. Patients with co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, active or prior documented GI 
bleeding within 12 months, ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months, hepatic 
encephalopathy  within  12 months  before  the  start  of  treatment,  and  active  or  prior  documented 
autoimmune or inflammatory disorders were excluded. 
In  Part 2A  of  Study  22,  eligible  patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  each  of  the  following 
3 treatment arms: D: Durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W; T: Tremelimumab 10 mg/kg Q4W × 7 doses followed 
by Q12W; T75+D: Tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W × 4 doses + durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W, followed by 
durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W 
Part  2B  was  a  safety  run-in  for  the  combination  regimen  consisting  of  a  single,  priming  dose  of 
tremelimumab  (300 mg)  added  to  durvalumab  Q4W.  Part 3  was  a  dose  expansion  cohort  of  patients 
enrolled in Parts 2A and B. Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:2:1:2 ratio to each of the following 
4  treatment  arms:  D:  Durvalumab  1500  mg  (20  mg/kg)  Q4W;  T300+D:  Tremelimumab  300  mg  (4 
mg/kg) × 1 dose + durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W; T: Tremelimumab 750 mg (10 mg/kg) Q4W 
× 7 doses followed by Q12W; T75+D: Tremelimumab 75 mg (1 mg/kg) Q4W× 4 doses + durvalumab 
1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg (20 mg/kg) Q4W. 
In Part 2A, patients were stratified based on viral status (uninfected, HCV infected, or HBV infected) and 
PD-L1 expression (positive, negative, or non-evaluable). In Part 3, patients were stratified based on viral 
status (uninfected, HCV infected, or HBV infected) and sorafenib-based therapy (refusers or all others).

Results 
A total of 326 (98.2%) patients in the FAS of Parts 2 and 3 received study treatment. At the final DCO, 
93.3% of patients across all treatment arms discontinued study treatment. The most frequently reported 
reason  for  discontinuing  study  treatment  was  HCC disease  progression  in  66.6%  of  patients;  11%  of 
patients  discontinued  due  to  AEs.  The  rate  of  study  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  PD  or  AEs  was 
similar across the T300+D and D treatment arms. 
The number of patients in Parts 2 and 3 with important protocol deviations with the potential to affect 
the analyses was low (13 patients overall [3.9%]).

Overall Survival (Part 2 Only) 
A total of 125 patients were randomized/allocated to treatment in Part 2: 40 in the D arm, 10 in the 
T300+D arm, 36 in the T arm, and 39 in the T75+D arm. At the final DCO, 81.6% of patients in part 2 
had died (FAS): 80.0% in the D arm, 70.0% in the T300+D arm, 80.6% in the T arm, and 87.2% in the 
T75+D arm. The percentage of patients alive at the final DCO and in survival follow-up (including those 
still receiving study treatment) was highest in the T300+D arm (30.0%) compared to the other 3 arms 
(10.3% to 17.5%). 
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  OS  was  highest  for  patients  receiving  T300+D  (28.06  months) 
compared to patients receiving D (11.78 months), T (17.05 months), or T75+D (13.34 months).  
Overall Survival (Part 3 Only) 
Part 3 included the following number of patients per treatment arm: 64 in D arm; 65 in T300+D arm; 
33 in T arm; 45 in T75+D arm. Median OS was higher for patients in the T300+D (16.16 months) and T 
arms (17.54 arms) compared to D (13.57 months) and T75+D (11.30 months). 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the new active substance, tremelimumab (T), in combination with the already approved 
PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (D) for the treatment  of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) is 
primarily based on the pivotal Himalaya study. This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase III 
study in patients with uHCC not eligible for locoregional therapy. Patients were recruited from 181 sites 
across 16 countries, mostly from countries with an EU-like population. No prior systemic therapy was 
allowed and only patients with mild or no symptoms pertaining to the HCC and/or liver cirrhosis were 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 92/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
eligible, which is not considered reflective of the general patient population  with uHCC.  However, the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are reflected in the SmPC section 5.1, so this is acceptable. 1324 patients 
were randomised to 4 arms, durvalumab monotherapy (D, n=389); tremelimumab single dose 300 mg 
+  durvalumab  (T300+D,  n=393);  Tremelimumab  75  mg  x  4  +  durvalumab  (T75+D,  n=153);  and 
sorafenib  (S,  n=389).  Randomization  was  stratified  according  to  macrovascular  invasion  (yes  versus 
no), etiology of liver disease (hepatitis B virus [confirmed HBV] versus hepatitis C virus [confirmed HCV] 
versus others), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1). The stratification factors are considered clinically relevant as 
they are important prognostic factors for the outcome of uHCC. Other important prognostic factors could 
have been added, such as AFP levels; however, considering the size of the pivotal trial, it is considered 
appropriate to limit the number of stratification factors to three. Additional supportive evidence of clinical 
efficacy was provided from study 22, a randomised, phase I/II, open-label study. 
The overall design of the pivotal Himalaya study is endorsed as it allows to assess the efficacy of the 
proposed dosing of tremelimumab single dose 300 mg + durvalumab 1500 mg iv followed by durvalumab 
monotherapy 1500 mg iv Q4W (T300+D) versus standard of care (Sorafenib - S) in the proposed first-
line setting. Moreover, the Applicant included a durvalumab monotherapy arm and an arm with another 
combination regimen of T75+D, which was abolished after some time.  
Baseline characteristics for patients included in the Himalaya study showed that the median age in the 
relevant arms (T300+D vs the S arm vs the T300+D arm of study 22) were 65 vs 64 vs 66 years of age; 
however, approximately half of the patients were <65 years of age and the vast majority of the patients 
were male (83.2% vs 86.6% vs 86.7%) and of white (46.3% vs 46% vs 36%) or Asian (49.6% vs 48.6% 
vs 58.7%) race.  Alcohol use was only registered in the pivotal Himalaya study and it is noted that a 
large proportion was never users (~40%) or former users (~45%). The baseline characteristics are well 
balanced between the arms, but only approximately 46% of the study population are considered EU like 
according  to  region  and  race  characteristics.  Moreover,  the  alcohol  use  in  the  study  population  is 
considered lower than for the EU population. 
Disease characteristics showed that most patients were ECOG PS 0 (~60%) and of advanced Barcelona 
Clinic  Liver Cancer (BCLC)  stage C  (~80%).  Additionally,  macrovascular  invasion  and/or  extrahepatic 
spread was observed for many (~65%). However, the poor prognostic factor of AFP >400 ng/ml was 
observed in approximately a third of the patients, which is also reflected by the distribution of the Child-
Pugh score categories, showing that many of the included patients have a favourable prognosis.  
It is noted that only a third of the included patients had tumours that were PD-L1 positive (TIP≥1%) and 
that  there  were  ~13%  of  the  patients  in  the  D+T  containing  arms,  who  had  missing  data  on  PD-L1 
status. Overall, the important disease characteristics are well distributed between the treatment arms. 
Regarding the level of poor prognostic factors, it is considered that these are lower than expected for 
the  targeted  patient  population,  which  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  interpreting  the  results  of  the 
studies.   
The primary objective of the pivotal Himalaya study was to assess superiority of efficacy of T300+D vs 
standard of care (sorafenib) regarding OS for the ITT population. The two key secondary objectives of 
the trial were to assess non-inferiority of the efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy versus SoC (sorafenib) 
regarding  OS  and  superiority  of  the  efficacy  of  durvalumab  monotherapy  versus  SoC  (sorafenib) 
regarding OS. Other important secondary endpoints are PFS and overall response rate plus duration of 
response. The current MAA for tremelimumab is based on efficacy results from the primary objective of 
the pivotal study. The primary objective and key secondary objectives pertain to overall survival, and 
this is endorsed, considering the targeted patient population and the robustness of OS as an endpoint.  
Although it does not preclude a benefit/risk assessment, the overall conduct of the study is considered 
suboptimal due to the changes in  primary  endpoints and sample size especially considering the open 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 93/137 
 
 
  
 
 
label  design.    Additionally,  interpretation  of  radiological  assessments  of  tumour  response  is  hindered 
because of the lack of blinded central review of the assessments in the final analysis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal Himalaya study: 
The primary objective was met as treatment with T300+D showed a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant improvement in OS compared to standard of care, sorafenib. Median OS was improved from 
13.77 months to 16.43 months, HR 0.78 (96.02% CI: 0.65, 0.92). The analysis was performed after 
~33  months  of  follow  up  and  66.7%  of  events  in  the  T300+D  arm  and  75.3%  events  in  the  S  arm, 
respectively, so the OS data are considered mature. The KM curves begin to separate after 4 months of 
therapy and stay separated.  
It is acknowledged that Himalaya was primarily designed to demonstrate superiority of T300+D vs S in 
terms of OS and was amended to demonstrate non-inferiority of D vs S for OS as the next analysis in 
the  hierarchical  testing.  Moreover,  the  study  design  allowed  for  assessment  of  the  contribution  of 
tremelimumab to the combination regimen, through prespecified exploratory analyses of T300+D vs D, 
which showed an HR of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.07) for OS, which was 16.43 months vs 16.56 months, 
respectively. The Applicant has further argued that due to the complementary mechanisms of action of 
tremelimumab and durvalumab, the reduction in risk of death, more patients achieving a BOR of CR plus 
more durable responses in the T300+D arm that the addition of tremelimumab is justified. Additionally, 
a post-hoc analysis calculating piecewise constant treatment effects favoured T300+D independent of 
selected  time  interval  when  compared  to  either  S  or  D,  further  illustrating  the  OS  benefit  offered  by 
T300+D  compared  with  D.  However,  there  are  remaining  uncertainties  regarding  the  optimal  dosing 
regimen e.g. would more than one single dose of tremelimumab have had a significant contribution to 
added  efficacy  compared  to  T300+D  and  is  300  mg  the  optimal  dose  or  could  the  same  efficacy  and 
maybe a better safety profile have been obtained with several but lower doses of tremelimumab.  
The secondary endpoint of ORR by investigator was 20.1% for the T300+D arm compared to 5.1% in 
the sorafenib arm, while 3.1% of the patients in the T300+D arm had a complete response (CR) vs no 
patients in the S arm. Confirmed ORR by BIRC was slightly lower in the T300+D arm (18.8%), but this 
is not directly comparable with ORR by Investigator, since the evaluation was only done in a subset of 
patients.  The  improvement  of  the  response  rate  both  by  INV  and  by  BIRC  is  considered  borderline 
clinically meaningful in its magnitude; however, the responders in the T300+D arm (n=79) had durable 
responses with a median DoR of 22.34 months. 
The PFS analyses were not in the testing hierarchy, so they are not controlled for multiplicity. PFS by 
investigator  was  not  clinically  significantly  improved,  since  the  median  PFS  was  3.78  months  in  the 
T300+D  arm versus  4.07 months in  the S  arm; HR 0.90 (95%CI:  0.77,  1.05).  The PFS  analyses are 
mature with 85.2% and 84.1% events in the T300+D and S arms, respectively and the KM curves do 
not  clearly  separate  at  any  time.  This  finding  is  considered  consistent  with  the  pattern  of  efficacy 
generally observed for immunotherapy, where PFS benefit is often lacking or of a small magnitude, while 
OS is often clinically significantly improved. Hence, this could be considered an acceptable result as the 
primary endpoint was OS, and that an OS benefit has been shown for the proposed treatment regimen 
T300+D vs S. 
However, there are uncertainties when interpreting PFS and ORR considering that the final analysis in 
an open label setting was done by investigators. Additionally, assessments were performed using RECIST 
1.1.  although  in  the  immunotherapy  setting,  irRECIST  may  have  been  more  appropriate/more 
informative.  Nevertheless,  rate  of  possible  pseudoprogression  of  HCC  with  CTLA-4/PD-L1  inhibition  is 
currently unknown, which creates uncertainty around PFS and ORR data, since patients with confirmed 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 94/137 
 
 
  
 
 
PD (according to RECIST 1.1) were discontinued from IP. Confirmation of PD required a follow-up scan 
evaluated by Confirmation of Radiological Progression criteria preferably at the next scheduled visit and 
no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD. In the HIMALAYA study, confirmation of PD 
was not mandatory as RECIST 1.1 used for final analysis does not require confirmation of progression 
and therefore was not done in the study. The lack of data on potential pseudoprogression is of concern 
as patients could be denied potentially beneficial treatment. This issue remains to be answered in clinical 
practice.    
Additionally, assessments by BICR were performed only on a subset of patients evaluable for 32 weeks 
of follow up (for interim analysis 1), and included RECIST 1.1, irRECIST, and mRECIST. Following interim 
analysis  1,  no  further  BICR  assessments  were  performed.  In  view  of  the  robustness  of  the  primary 
endpoint (OS) the Applicant’s approach regarding PFS can be accepted.  
The  study  design  of  Himalaya  allowed  for  assessment  of  the  contribution  of  tremelimumab  to  the 
combination regimen, through prespecified exploratory analyses of T300+D vs D, which showed an HR 
of  0.90  (95%CI:  0.76,  1.07)  for  OS,  which  was  16.43  months  vs  16.56  months,  respectively.  The 
Applicant  has  also  provided  a  rationale  for  the  addition  of  tremelimumab  to  durvalumab  for  the  HCC 
indication, which is primarily based on the following: the combined blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-(L)1 to 
increase effector T-cell response through two distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action and an 
approximately  10%  reduction  in  the  average  risk  of  death  was  observed  with  T300+D  versus  D. 
Moreover, while the objective response rates with T300+D and D were similar in HIMALAYA (20.1% vs. 
17.0%), twice as many BORs of CR were observed in HIMALAYA with T300+D (12 [3.1%]) compared to 
D (6 [1.5%]). 
The provided arguments are acknowledged and it is accepted that the Applicant seeks an approval for 
the T300+D regimen. However, there remains to be unanswered questions to what would have been the 
optimal dosing regimen e.g. would more than one single dose of tremelimumab have had a significant 
contribution to added efficacy compared to T300+D and is 300 mg the optimal dose or could the same 
efficacy  and  maybe  a  better  safety  profile  have  been  obtained  with  several  but  lower  doses  of 
tremelimumab.  
PRO  data  was  collected  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  Since  the  pivotal  study  was  open-label  and  PRO 
endpoints were not multiplicity-protected, clinical meaningfulness of PRO data is not considered relevant 
and the Applicant has agreed to delete them from the SmPC. 
No  additional  information  on  changes  in  AFP  were  provided  as  these  data  were  not  collected  in  the 
HIMALAYA study.  
Relevant subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of OS show that the benefit of T300+D vs S is 
maintained across important subgroups of age of less than or ≥ 65 years, HBV or other reasons for liver 
disease, ECOG performance status, macrovascular invasion (MVI), AFP at baseline and BCLB score C.  
The supportive Study 22: 
The supportive study 22 was a randomized, multicentre, open-label, multipart study designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab in patients with advanced HCC in the 2L+ 
setting. The study was comprised of multiple parts, but the results from the T300+D arm is considered 
of  most  relevance  for  the  proposed  indication  (n=75),  although  the  study  randomised  patients  to  4 
treatment arms. Patients were immunotherapy-naïve patients with advanced HCC, who had progressed 
on,  were  intolerant  to,  or  refused  treatment  with  sorafenib  or  another  approved  Vascular  endothelial 
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) TKI. Due to different stratification factors in Parts 2A and 3 and lack of 
randomisation altogether in Part 2B, pooling of efficacy data is inappropriate. Fortunately, OS data from 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 95/137 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Part  2  and  3  is  available  separately  as  well.  Although  there  were  no  interim  analyses  planned  in  the 
Original  Protocol  (09  April  2015),  in  the  end  6  interim  analyses  were  performed  (and  added  through 
Protocol Amendments). 
Baseline data for the T300+D arm showed that the median age was 66 years and the vast majority of 
the patients were male (86.7%) and of white (36%) or Asian (58.7%) race. Disease characteristics show 
that  the  vast  majority  of  patients  were  ECOC  PS  0  (61.3%)  and  disease  of  advanced  BCLC  stage  C 
(77.3%) plus macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (77.3%).  
In  conclusion,  Study  22  is  an  early  phase,  exploratory  study  that  was  amended  several  times.  The 
primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability, whereas efficacy was a secondary 
objective and there was no hierarchical testing procedure or correction for multiplicity. The efficacy data 
quality should be viewed in this light. Moreover, out of the 75 patients in Study 22, who were treated 
with T300+D, only 55 patients had received prior treatment with sorafenib and were thus truly ‘second 
line’. Due to the lack of a SoC comparator arm in Study 22, there is no benchmark for the results of the 
T300+D study arm, as there is insufficient understanding of the relevance of the efficacy as observed in 
the other study arms. In addition, the exploratory design of Study 22 and in particular the lack of a SAP 
that would provide for formal comparisons between the study arms, hampers both the contextualisation 
and interpretation of the efficacy results obtained in these 55 patients. As a consequence, the time-to-
event endpoints cannot be interpreted adequately. It is noted that the ORR in these 55 patients was only 
20%, which cannot be considered dramatic (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). 
The  final  analysis  showed  a  median  OS  of  17  months  (65.3%  events)  for  patients  who  received  the 
proposed dosing regimen of T300+D, while the ORR was 24% and the duration of response (DoR) was 
18  months.  The  Applicant  compares  this  result  to  durvalumab  monotherapy;  however,  this  is  not 
approved  for  or  is  standard  of  care  (SOC)  in  the  2L+  setting,  so  this  comparison  is  not  considered 
relevant for the current application. Since none of the arms of Study 22 contained any SOC, the results 
for the T300+D arm are considered supportive of efficacy for the proposed dosing regimen in the first-
line setting. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal Himalaya study show a statistically significant and clinically relevant OS 
benefit over standard of care in the first-line setting of unresectable HCC.

The pivotal safety dataset used to characterize the safety profile of durvalumab in combination with 
tremelimumab in the proposed indication was derived from pooled data from HIMALAYA and Study 22. 
The populations in the HCC-tumor pools are described below: 
•  HCC  T300+D  pool:  This  population  consists  of  all patients  who  have  received  at  least  1 dose  of 
durvalumab given at a dose of 1500mg IV Q4W (or equivalent) in combination with tremelimumab 
300 mg IV x 1 dose (or equivalent) for HCC.  
•  HCC D pool: This population consists of all patients who have received at least 1 dose of durvalumab 
monotherapy given at a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W IV (or equivalent) for HCC.

Includes AEs on the AE CRF form with action taken indicating dose delay or dose interruption, and AEs meeting study level 
dose delay definitions, where applicable. 
Note: Includes AEs with an onset date on or after the date of first dose or pre-treatment AEs that increase in severity on or after the 
date of first dose up to and including 90 days following the date of last dose of study treatment or up to and including the date of 
initiation of the first subsequent therapy (whichever occurs first).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Table 55. Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (≥ 2% Patients 
in Any Treatment Arm; Safety Analysis Set) 
Treatment-related Serious Adverse Events 
In  the  Safety  Analysis  Set,  treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported  for  more  patients  in  the 
tremelimumab-containing arms than in the D and S arms (D, 8.2%; T300+D, 17.5%; T75+D, 18.4%; 
S, 9.4% patients). There were no treatment-related SAEs by PT reported by ≥ 5% patients. As with all 
SAEs, the majority of treatment-related SAEs occurred in the CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 category within every 
SOC. The frequency of treatment-related CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 SAEs was 24 patients (6.2%) in arm D, 
44 patients (11.3%) in arm T300+D, 19 patients (12.5%) in arm T75+D, and 22 patients (5.9%) in arm 
S. Few treatment-related SAEs resulted in death. 
17.5%  of  the  SAEs  (40.5%)  in  the  T300+D  arm  were  treatment-related.  The  below  table  describes 
treatment-related SAEs for the T300+D and S arms of the Himalaya study and the HCC pool (frequency 
more than 1%).

Derived from laboratory assessments between the start of treatment and up to and including 90 days following the date of last dose 
of study medication or until the initiation of the first subsequent therapy (whichever occurred first). 
Patients were counted only once in the worst reported subcategory. 
ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; D, durvalumab 1500 mg (or equivalent); HCC, hepatocellular 
carcinoma; IV, intravenous; Q4W, every 4 weeks; T300+D, tremelimumab 300 mg for a single dose in combination with 
durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W; T75+D, durvalumab given at a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W (or equivalent) IV in combination with 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W (or equivalent), for any line of therapy (across tumor types); T750, tremelimumab monotherapy 
10 mg/kg Q4W (or equivalent) for any line of therapy (across tumor types); TBL, total bilirubin; ULN, upper limit of normal.  
The number of probable DILI or immune-related hepatitis cases were as follows: 2 patients in the D arm 
(E7507003  and  E7509045);  4  patients  in  the  T300+D  arm  (E3205054,  E3205056,  E3506001,  and 
E7824002); 3 patients for the T75+D arm (E4315001, E6207021, and E7708002); and 3 patients for 
the S arm (E2308004, E6007014, and E7001002).  
Four patients in Study 22 had liver function test abnormalities meeting the criteria for Hy’s Law for 
whom the role of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab could not be completely excluded. In the 
HIMALAYA study, 2 patients in the D arm, 4 patients in the T300+D arm, and 3 patients in the T75+D 
arm had liver function test abnormalities meeting the criteria for Hy’s Law for whom the role of 
durvalumab and/or tremelimumab could not be completely excluded. Narratives for the 4 patients, 
who met the Hy’s law criteria in the T300+D arm have been provided and has not given rise to any 
concerns

were reported. 1 patient needed high-dose corticosteroid treatment and the median time to onset for 
the imAE of hypothyroid event was 85 days (range: 26 to 763 days). 
21 patients (4.5%) in the HCC pool had imAEs of hyperthyroid events. Grade 3 or 4 events were 
reported in 1 patient (0.2%) and no grade 5 events were reported. 4 patients (0.9%) received high 
dose corticosteroid treatment and one patient (0.2%) discontinued study treatment. The median time 
to onset for the imAE of hyperthyroid events was 30 days (range: 13 to 60 days).

Body weight 
In the HCC D pool, a slight increasing trend for Grade 3 to 4 AEs was observed for patients with body 
weight  ≥ 90 kg  (N=55),  compared  to patients  < 70 kg  (54.5%  vs  36.2%),  and  similarly  for  SAEs 
(49.1% vs 29.4%). A similar trend was observed in the Pan-tumor D pool. 
ECOG performance status 
In  both  of  the  HCC-tumor  pools, patients  with  a  baseline  ECOG  status  of  1  experienced  a  higher 
incidence of Grade 3 to 4 AEs (T300+D pool: 56.6% vs 49.1%) and AEs leading to death (T300+D pool: 
10.3% vs 5.6%). In the HCC-tumor pools, no other clinically meaningful differences were observed in 
the safety profile of T300+D versus D alone with respect to performance status. 
Extrinsic factors

Post marketing experience 
Durvalumab  was  first  approved  for  marketing  in  the  US  on  01 May 2017.  The  total  post-marketing 
exposure of durvalumab since launch and until 30 June 2021 is estimated to be 52006 patient-years. No 
new safety concerns have been identified based on post-marketing safety reports  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  population  of  interest  are  patients  with  unresectable  HCC  (uHCC),  who  have  received  the 
proposed  dosing  regimen  of  a  single  dose  of  tremelimumab  300  mg  +  durvalumab  in  combination 
followed  by  durvalumab  monotherapy  (T300+D),  which  consists  of  388  patients  from  the  pivotal 
Himalaya study and 74 patients from the supportive study 22, in total 462 patients.  
The  median  treatment  duration  in  the  Himalaya  study  were  5.5  months,  while  the  median  treatment 
duration  was  4.1  months  in  the  Sorafenib  arm  (n=374).  In  the  HCC  pool,  the  median  duration  of 
exposure was 20 weeks and approximately 50% of patients received at least 24 weeks of treatment at 
DCO, while ~28% had 52 weeks of treatment. Hence, the exposure to the proposed regimen and the 
size of the safety database are considered sufficient for a safety assessment. 
Almost  all  patients  in  the  HCC  pool,  who  received  T300+D,  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event 
(AE) (97.6%), and 51.9% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AEs. For the Himalaya study, a similar pattern was 
observed in T300+D arm: 97.4% experienced at least one AE, 50.5% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE, 
and  SAEs  were  observed  in  40.5%  of  the  patients,  noting  7.7%  had  an  SAE  leading  to  death.  The 
discontinuation rate due to AEs was 13.7%. In comparison, 95.5% of the patients in the Sorafenib arm 
also experienced at least one AE, and 52.4% experienced a grade 3 or 4 AE. SAEs were observed in 
29.7% of the patients, of which 7.2% had an SAE leading to death, while the discontinuation rate due 
to AEs was 16.8%.  
Treatment-related AEs in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya study were rash (19.6%), pruritus 
(17%),  diarrhoea  (16.5%),  and  hypothyroidism  (10.8%).  In  comparison,  common  treatment-related 
AEs in the Sorafenib arm were diarrhoea (38.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) (43.9%), 
hypertension (15%), and fatigue (14.7%). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs in the 
T300+D  arm  were  increased  lipase  (4.4%),  diarrhoea  (3.4%),  amylase  increased  (2.6%)  and  ASAT 
increased  (2.3%).  Common  grade  3  or  4  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  S  arm  were  PPE  (8.8%), 
hypertension  (5.3%),  and  diarrhoea  (4%),  so  in  comparison  there  are  more  high-grade  toxicity  with 
sorafenib in favour of T300+D (data not shown).  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  for  T300+D  include  immune-mediated  AEs  (imAEs)  and  as 
expected, the occurrence of imAEs are much more common in the HCC pool vs the Sorafenib arm (36.1% 
vs 7.5%), and these were of grade 3 or 4 in 13.4% vs 2.4% of the patients, respectively. Serious imAEs 
are considered common (10.2% vs 1.1%) and 6 patients (1.3%) died from these, while a quarter of the 
patients need systemic corticosteroids in the HCC pool versus only 4% in the Sorafenib arm. Moreover, 
many patients needed endocrine therapy, when treated with T300+D vs Sorafenib (14.9% vs 3.5%). It 
is noted that very few patients had to discontinue treatment due to imAEs (5.6% vs 1.6%), which is 
reassuring. Other common imAEs with T300+D were hepatic events (7.4%) and diarrhoea/colitis (6.5%). 
Grade  3  or  4  hepatic  events  (5%)  and  diarrhoea/colitis  (3.7%)  were  the  most  frequent  high-grade 
events, and these are difficult to manage in the clinic, so it is important that this is clear from the SmPC 
section 4.4, which is the case. Overall, imAEs were frequently reported and the number of AESIs and 
imAEs  significantly  differ  for  dermatitis/rash,  pancreatic  events,  hepatic  events,  diarrhoea/colitis, 
hypothyroid  and  hyperthyroid  events,  pneumonitis.  Some  imAEs  such  as  endocrinopathies, 
hepatotoxicity,  dermatitis/rash  are  expected  to  be  more  manageable  than  others,  such  as 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 127/137 
 
 
  
 
 
diarrhoea/colitis,  pancreatic  events  and  pneumonitis.  The  latter  are  more  difficult  to  manage,  often 
require hospitalisation, and might not be assumed as immune-mediated events by clinicians.  
Events  of  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome  or  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  have  been  reported  in  patients 
treated with PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of  rash  or  dermatitis  and  managed  through  dose  interruption,  treatment  discontinuation  and/or 
corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, 
and alkaline phosphatase levels prior to initiation of treatment and prior to each subsequent infusion. 
Additional monitoring is to be considered based on clinical evaluation. Patients should be monitored for 
abnormal  renal  function  tests  prior  to  and  periodically  during  treatment.  Patients  should  also  be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis. Immune mediated 
hepatitis,  nephritis,  pancreatitis  and  myocarditis  should  be  managed  through  dose  interruption, 
treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be 
confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, and 
managed  through  dose  interruption,  treatment  discontinuation  and  corticosteroid  treatment  (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and 
managed  through  dose  interruption,  treatment  discontinuation  and/or  corticoisteroid  treatment  (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  abnormal  thyroid  function  tests  prior  to  and  periodically  during 
treatment  and  as  indicated  based  on  clinical  evaluation.  Immune-mediated  hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed through dose interruption, symptomatic treatment 
or thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For 
symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed through dose interruption, corticoisteroid 
treatment and hormone replacement (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  type  1  diabetes  mellitus.  For 
symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed via treatment with insulin as clinically 
indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypophysitis  or  hypopituitarism.  For 
symptomatic  hypophysitis  or  hypopituitarism,  patients  should  be  managed  as  recommended  through 
dose interruption and corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Given  the  mechanism  of  action  of  tremelimumab  in  combination  with  durvalumab,  other  potential 
immune mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been  observed  in  patients  treated  with  tremelimumab  in  combination  with  durvalumab:  myasthenia 
gravis,  myositis,  myelitis  transverse,  polymyositis,  meningitis,  encephalitis,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome, 
immune  thrombocytopenia  and  cystitis  noninfective.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and 
symptoms  and  managed  through  dose  interruption,  treatment  discontinuation  and/or  corticoisteroid 
treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 128/137 
 
 
  
 
 
Although the rate of imAEs with the T300+D is considered high, these are considered generally clinically 
manageable. 
Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs. IRRs should be managed through 
dose interruption, treatment discontinuation, prophylaxis and appropriate treatment (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were very common in the T300+D arm vs the S arm in Himalaya study 
(40.5% vs 29.7%) and it is noted that 10% less SAEs were observed with durvalumab monotherapy, 
suggesting that the addition of the single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab significantly adds toxicity. The 
most frequent SAEs in the T300+D arm vs the S arm were diarrhoea (2.3% vs 1.6%), sepsis (2.1% vs 
0), and pneumonia (1.8% vs 2.1%). Overall, the high level of SAEs with T300+D is worrisome although 
the targeted patient population is previously untreated patients and this may influence the tolerability in 
the  general  patient  population  in  the  first-line  setting.  Of  note,  diarrhoea  and  colitis  are  important 
identified  risks  of  the  anti-CTLA-4  agent  ipilimumab,  which  has  a  similar  mechanism  of  action  as 
tremelimumab. Moreover, the targeted patient population from the 2L+ setting is expected to have even 
more serious toxicity.   
AEs leading to death occurred in 34 patients (7.4%) in the HCC T300+D pool and 30 patients (7.7%) in 
the T300+D arm of the Himalaya study.  
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the HCC pool was 13.6%, while it was 13.7% of the 
patients in the pivotal Himalaya study. Most commonly the patients discontinued treatment due to AST 
increased and diarrhoea, which reflects the safety profile of T300+D. Dose delays were very common in 
the patients who had T300+D in the HCC pool (32.3%) and mostly due to diarrhoea and increased liver 
enzymes. 
Laboratory findings showed that the changes in haematological parameters were mostly of low grade 
and pertaining to a decrease in lymphocytes ≥grade 2 for 20% of the patients and grade 3 or 4 in 11.8%. 
This  is  in  line  with  the  findings  in  the  pivotal  Himalaya  study.  Laboratory  shifts  for  clinical  chemistry 
parameters were rare and mostly to low grade events. It is noted that increased glucose was common 
in  the  HCC  pool  (19.4%)  and  that  grade  3  or  4  were  observed  in  14.6%  of  the  patients.  New  onset 
diabetes mellitus was identified in 39 (8.4%) of 462 patients in the T300+D HCC pool and 30 (6.1%) of 
492 patients in the D monotherapy HCC pool. Eight (1.7%) SAE reports of hyperglycaemia occurred in 
the T300+D HCC pool and most patients did not receive therapy for the hyperglycaemic event and the 
reported events were resolved in 21 (4.5%) of the patients in the T300+D HCC pool. One patient with 
hyperglycaemia  and  one  patient  with  T2DM  discontinued  treatment.  Liver  toxicity  was  very  often 
observed regarding  elevated hepatic  laboratory  parameters  in  the HCC  pool. Potential  Hy’s law  cases 
were reported for 57 patients (12.3%) in the HCC pool and the narratives for the 4 patients, who met 
the Hy’s law criteria in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya study are all agreed.  
Increased  toxicity  with  increasing  age  was  observed  in  the  HCC  pool,  as  the  incidence  of  ADRs  were 
72.1% in the patients of <65 years of age vs 79.8% in patients of 65-75 years of age and 85.7% in 
those of ≥75 years of age. A trend towards more discontinuations with increasing age was also observed.  
Safety and tolerability profiles were similar in patients with ADAs and in those without ADAs. According 
to the Applicant, there were no new types of events or events clearly suggestive or indicative of infusion 
reactions or immune complex disease. 
Overall,  the  toxicity  observed  in  the  first-line  study  Himalaya  was  significantly  less  than  what  was 
observed for the entire HCC pool, which is to be expected for the included study population, who was 
previously systemically untreated patients, who are usually more fit and able to tolerate toxicities. The 
toxicity observed with Sorafenib is similar to the toxicity level observed in the HCC pool and in some 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 129/137 
 
 
  
 
 
cases worse than what was observed for the T300+D arm of the Himalaya study. However, the toxicity 
profiles of T300+D and Sorafenib differs due to different mechanisms of action mainly between immune 
checkpoint inhibition and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The toxicity of the proposed dosing regimen of T300+D is considerable, since approximately half of the 
patients experience grade 3 or 4 adverse events and 40% of the patients have serious adverse events, 
mostly pertaining to diarrhoea and immune-mediated adverse events. The discontinuation rate is 
however relatively low (~13%) and most of the toxicity observed is clinically manageable and the 
toxicity profile of T300+D is not considered significantly worse than that of Sorafenib, the current 
standard of care.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
EMA/42902/2023  
Page 130/137 
 
 
  
 
 
A readability test was performed for the original dossier and provided during the assessment of the initial 
dossier. This variation aims at extending the indication for durvalumab to be used in combination with 
tremelimumab for the treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The same route 
of administration (intravenous use) and age group (adults) is applicable to this variation. The package 
leaflet is being updated in section 1-4 and are otherwise similar to the text previously tested at the time 
of the MAA. The changes are not considered too significant and  an additional user consultation is not 
considered necessary for this new indication. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Imfinzi  (durvalumab)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and it is a biological product that is not 
covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
The aim of the applied dosing regimen of tremelimumab plus durvalumab (T300+D) in comparison to 
Sorafenib (SOC) in the targeted population is to prolong overall survival (OS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first-line treatment of uHCC includes sorafenib (a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor - TKI) based on OS benefit 
when compared to placebo (10.7 vs 7.9 months) and lenvatinib, another TKI, which is non-inferior when 
compared  to  sorafenib  (median  OS  13.6  vs  12.3  months).  Atezolizumab  (a  PD-L1  inhibitor)  in 
combination with bevacizumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor) has also been 
approved in the first-line setting, based on the Phase III IMbrave150 study showing improvements of 
OS  and  PFS  compared  to  sorafenib  i.e.  the  median  OS  was  19.2  months  with  atezolizumab  + 
bevacizumab vs 13.4 months with Sorafenib (HR, 0.66 [95%CI: 0.52, 0.85]), while the PFS by blinded 
review was 6.9 vs. 4.3 months (HR 0.65 [95%CI: 0.53, 0.81]).  
Despite  recent  advances  in  treatment  options,  patients  with  uHCC  continue  to  have  a  short  life 
expectancy  and  the  underlying  liver  disease  and  portal  vein  hypertension  increase  the  risk  of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be potentially life-threatening. Currently available therapies provide 
only  a  modest  improvement  in  survival  with  safety  profiles  that  require  management  due  to  adverse 
events such as diarrhoea, hypertension, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE). Treatment with 
atezolizumab  plus  bevacizumab  also  carries  a  higher  incidence  of  bleeding,  including  fatal  bleeding,

despite  attempts  to  exclude  patients  at  risk  for  gastrointestinal  bleeding  from  the  pivotal  study. 
Moreover, the underlying liver cirrhosis may result in moderate liver dysfunction, which may exacerbate 
the  toxicity  of  systemic  therapies  such  as  TKIs.  Hence,  additional  therapeutic  options  are  needed, 
including options for patients with uHCC, who are at higher risk of  bleeding events, so there exist an 
unmet medical need for better and more tolerable treatment options for patients with uHCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  Himalaya  is  a  randomised,  open-label,  multicentre  Phase III  study  in  patients  with 
unresectable HCC not eligible for locoregional therapy, which compared tremelimumab + durvalumab 
(T300+D) to standard of care, sorafenib, in the first-line setting. The primary endpoint was OS in the 
ITT population.  
Additional supportive evidence of clinical efficacy was provided from Study 22, a randomised, phase I/II, 
open-label  study  conducted  in  the  2L+  setting,  comparing  the  efficacy  of  T300+D  and  durvalumab 
monotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint for the Himalaya study was met as treatment with T300+D showed a statistically 
significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to standard of care, Sorafenib.  
•  At data cutoff 27 August 2021 and after ~33 months of follow up, 66.7% OS events had occurred 
in  the  T300+D  arm  versus  75.3%  OS  events  in  the  Sorafenib  arm,  treatment  with  T300+D 
showed  a  statistically  significant  survival  benefit  as  compared  with  SoC:  Median  OS  was 
improved from 13.77 months to 16.43 months, HR 0.78 (96.02% CI: 0.65, 0.93). 
• 
The secondary endpoint of ORR by investigator was 20.1% for the T300+D arm compared to 
5.1%  in  the  sorafenib  arm,  and  the  median  duration  of  response  was  22.34  months  in  the 
T300+D arm vs 18.43 months in the sorafenib arm. 
• 
The PFS analyses were not controlled for multiplicity. PFS by investigator was not significantly 
improved, since the median PFS was 3.78 months in the T300+D arm versus 4.07 months in the 
S arm; HR 0.90 (95%CI: 0.77, 1.05). The event rates were 85.2% and 84.1% in the T300+D 
and S arms, respectively. 
•  Relevant subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint of OS show that the benefit of T300+D 
vs S is maintained across important subgroups of age of less than or ≥ 65 years, HBV or other 
reasons  for  liver  disease,  ECOG  performance  status,  macrovascular  invasion  (MVI),  AFP  at 
baseline and BCLB score C. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
None.    
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety populations of interest are the 388 patients from the pivotal Himalaya study and the patients 
included in the HCC pool (n=462), which also contains patients from the supportive study 22. The median 
EMA/42902/2023

treatment duration in the Himalaya study were 5.5 months, while the median treatment duration was 
4.1 months in the Sorafenib arm (n=374).  
Almost  all  of  the  patients  in  the  HCC  pool,  who  received  T300+D,  experienced  at  least  one  adverse 
event  (AE)  (97.6%),  and  51.9%  experienced  a  grade  3  or  4  AE.  For  the  Himalaya  study,  a  similar 
pattern was observed.  
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the T300+D arm of the pivotal Himalaya study were rash, pruritus, 
diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. The most common grade 3 or 4 ADRs in the T300+D arm were increased 
aspartate  aminotransferase/  alanine  aminotransferase,  increased  lipase,  increased  amylase  and 
diarrhoea.  
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  for  T300+D  include  immune-mediated  AEs  (imAEs)  and  as 
expected, the occurrence of imAEs are much more common in the HCC pool vs the Sorafenib arm (36.1% 
vs 7.5%), and these were of grade 3 or 4 in 13.4% vs 2.4% of the patients, respectively. Serious imAEs 
were observed in 10.2% vs 1.1% and 6 patients (1.3%) died from these.  
The most common serious adverse reactions in the T300+D HCC pool are colitis (2.6%), diarrhoea 
(2.4%), pneumonia (2.2%), and hepatitis (1.7%). 
In the pivotal Himalaya study, 6.1% of the patients in the T300+D arm died from an adverse event, 
while it was 7.4% in the HCC pool.  
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  due  to  ADRs  was  6.5%.  Most  commonly  the  patients  discontinued 
treatment  due  to  ADRs  of  hepatitis  (1.5%)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased/alanine 
aminotransferase increased (1.3%).  
Laboratory  findings  showed  that  the  changes  in  haematological  parameters  and  clinical  chemistry 
were mostly to low grade events. It is noted that increased glucose was common in the HCC pool (19.4%) 
and that grade 3 or 4 were observed in 14.6% of the patients. Liver toxicity was often observed regarding 
elevated hepatic laboratory parameters in the HCC pool and potential Hy’s law cases were reported for 
57 patients (12.3%) in the HCC pool.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are very limited safety data on elderly aged 75 years and older (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  proposed  dosing  regimen  of  tremelimumab  +  durvalumab  provides  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically meaningful survival benefit compared to the current standard of care, sorafenib, in a head-to-
head  comparison  from  the  pivotal  Himalaya  study,  in  a  population  of  patients  with  unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received prior systemic treatment. The ORR was also significantly 
improved; however, the magnitude of patients who had an objective response with T300+D is still low 
(~20%).  The  few  objective  responses  were  durable  (~22  months),  which  is  considered  clinically 
significant. Hence, the efficacy of T300+D in the first-line setting could be considered shown.  Supportive 
evidence for the application comes from Study 22, which compared T300+D to durvalumab monotherapy 
in the 2L+ setting. 
The safety profiles of T300+D versus sorafenib are distinct as they have different mechanisms of action 
(immune checkpoint inhibition vs TKI) and the toxicity does not seem worse than sorafenib regarding 
grade 3 or 4 AEs (50.5% vs 52.4%), AEs leading to discontinuation (13.7% vs 16.8%), and AEs leading 
to death (7.7% vs 7.2%) as reported in the pivotal Himalaya study. The safety profile of tremelimumab 
in  combination  with  durvalumab  in  the  HCC  setting  is  serious  and  has  to  be  weighed  against  the 
seriousness  of  palliative  setting  and  individual  patient  (ECOG  status,  age,  comorbidities).  This  is  of 
particular importance since a significant proportion of the immune-mediated adverse events observed 
with the T300+D regimen were serious (e.g. diarrhoea/colitis, pancreatitis and pneumonitis), expected 
EMA/42902/2023

to  be  less  manageable  and  often  require  hospitalisation.  Immune-mediated  AEs  have  therefore  been 
included as important identified risks in the list of safety concerns for durvalumab. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The shown overall survival benefit and the safety profile of T300+D not worse than that of standard of 
care, sorafenib, support a positive benefit-risk balance in the first-line treatment setting of advanced, 
unresectable HCC.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of durvalumab + tremelimumab in the first line treatment of uHCC is 
positive.

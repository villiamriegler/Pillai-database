emtricitabine, cobicistat and cobicistat-containing products,

the product information. In addition, the existing 
information in the product information on the drug drug 
interactions with atorvastatin, sildenafil, colchicine was 
updated. No new interaction study was performed by the 
MAH. The proposed changes mirror the data mentioned in 
the SmPC of the drugs concerned or are based on 
theoretical considerations. The co-administration of 
colchicine with Aptivus/ritonavir is contraindicated in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment; however, a 
reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of 
colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with 
normal renal or hepatic function if treated with 
Aptivus/ritonavir.

centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-
way crossover trial with two parallel dose groups. The 
effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF 
interval was measured in 81 healthy subjects receiving the 
following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: 
tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a 
supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and 
placebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo 
adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms 
(1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose 
and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the 
supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at 
therapeutic dose with low dose of ritonavir did not prolong 
the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.

of the Summary of Product Characteristics in line 
with the annex A of the revised Guideline on the 
clinical development of medicinal products for the 
treatment of HIV infection (CPMP/EWP/633/02, Rev. 
2), including addition of new data concerning the co-
administration of tipranavir with the proton pump 
inhibitors (FU2 059.1) and rosuvastatin/pravastatin 
(FU2 018.2). Consequently to update of 4.5 the 
section 4.4 "Special warnings and precautions for 
use" is updated concerning the co-administration 
with proton pump inhibitors and the co-
administration with statins. In addition the MAH took 
the opportunity to update Section 4.2 "Posology and 
method of administration" with a recommendation in 
case of missed dose. The package leaflet was 
updated accordingly. The MAH also amended the 
contact details of the local representative in 
table with three columns for each product co-administered 
with tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) in accordance with the 
guideline (CPMP/EWP/633/02, Rev. 2). The description of 
the interactions data follows a single pattern for all 
medicinal products co-administered with TPV which 
increases the legibility and facilitates the use of the 
interaction section for the treating physician as outlined in 
the guidance. Pharmacokinetics data and recommendations 
to treating physician are supported by clinical studies 
already submitted by the MAH and assessed by the CHMP 
at the time of the original marketing authorisation 
application or subsequently during the lifecycle of TPV 
through clinical Follow-Up Measures and type II variation 
procedures. As a consequence of the addition of 
information on rosuvastatin and pravastatin in section 4.5, 
section 4.4 on co-administration with statins is updated to 
reinforce the recommendations of careful monitoring by

and rabeprazole in section 4.5 section 4.4 is updated to 
reinforce the guidance to not recommend the combined 
used of TPV/r with either omeprazole or esomeprazole by 
extending it to other PPIs. In order to further improve 
treatment compliance the recommendation in case of 
missed dose has been added in section 4.2. If a dose of 
TPV/r is missed by more than 5 hours, the patient should 
wait and then take the next dose of TPV/r at the regularly 
scheduled time. If the dose is missed by less than 5 hours, 
the patient should take the dose immediately and take the 
next dose of TPV/r at the regularly scheduled time. This is 
based on the half-life of TPV in the presence of RTV and the 
recommended dosing interval of approximately 5 hours 
used in most TPV clinical trials.

between tipranavir and enfuvirtide was suspected from 13 
case reports which involved a hepatic event whilst the 
patients were on a tipranavir/ritonavir/enfuvirtide

described this interaction where co-administration of TPV/r 
with ENF resulted in an increase in TPV and RTV plasma 
trough concentrations of approximately 50%. At last, in the 
RESIST trials, higher TPV trough plasma levels were 
observed in patients receiving TPV/r with ENF compared to 
patients not receiving ENF (45% higher). The increase in 
plasma concentrations occurred within the first two weeks 
of combination. These findings cannot be explained by the 
metabolic profile of the medicinal products. No information 
was available for AUC and Cmax parameters. Clinical data 
available from the RESIST trials did not suggest any

administration of tipranavir/ritonavir with bupropion 
resulted in potentially clinically significant reductions in 
Ctrough, Cmax and AUC of bupropion (60%, 44% and 
49%, respectively) without significant changes in Tmax and 
T1/2. Co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir with 
bupropion also resulted in 24-25% decreases in the 
Ctrough, Cmax and AUC for the active metabolite 
hydroxybupropion. The half-life of hydroxybupropion was 
substantially reduced by approximately 58%. This 
reduction is likely due to induction of CYP2B6 and UGT 
activity by ritonavir, and possibly due to induction of 
CYP3A4 by tipranavir/ritonavir. As the maximum 
recommended dose of bupropion (300 mg / day) should not 
be increased to compensate for this induction effect, the 
combination should be avoided. However, if the co-
administration with bupropion is considered unavoidable, 
close clinical monitoring for bupropion efficacy is necessary.

effects of tipranavir (TPV) on coagulation.  Bleeding events 
were observed, associated with prolonged prothrombin 
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and 
a decrease in some vitamin K dependent factors. Co-
administration of tipranavir with vitamin E-TPGS, an 
esterified derivative of vitamin E, resulted in an 
exacerbation of the anti-coagulant effects of TPV in male 
rats, specifically causing increases in PT, aPTT, and 
Thrombotest levels and decreases in vitamin K dependent 
factors. Co-administration of tipranavir with vitamin E

tipranavir/ritonavir in case of co-administration would be 
required. However, a clinically important effect on 
omeprazole concentrations was observed. Omeprazole 
exposure was decreased by about 70% in the presence of 
steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir. Due to the uncertainty of 
the effectiveness of such lowered concentrations of 
omeprazole in patients, this combination is therefore not 
recommended.  
Nevertheless, for those patients in need of proton-pump-
inhibitor therapy and without reasonable alternatives, 
omeprazole might be used. This will necessitate appropriate 
omeprazole dose increases and clinical evaluation of the 
patient's response to therapy and, if necessary, further

Moreover, it was confirmed that efavirenz plasma

Due to the absence of significant interaction between

the MAH on the nevirapine-tipranavir/ritonavir interaction, 
a significant drug-drug interaction between nevirapine and

be a substrate and also an inhibitor of  
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Consequently, it is possible that 
interactions between tipranavir and  
P-gp could affect the absorption, distribution and excretion 
of other drugs that interact with P-gp when administered 
concomitantly with tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r). At this 
time, the most reliable method to study the ability for a 
drug to induce Cytochrome P (CYP) is to quantify the 
enzyme activity of primary hepatocyte cultures. It has been 
shown in vitro that tipranavir is a CYP3A4 inducer but only 
mildly induces P-gp, MRP2 (Multidrug resistance Protein 2) 
and UGT1A1 (Uridine glucuronosyltransferase 1A1). Based 
on these results, the data related to P-gp induction by 
tipranavir in the current section 4.5 of Aptivus SPC was

to tipranavir/ritonavir and with the first dose of 
tipranavir/ritonavir, there was a clinically important 
increase in tadalafil exposure.  However, for 
tipranavir/ritonavir administration at steady-state, there 
was essentially no change in tadalafil except for the Cmax 
that was decreased. Although there were no important 
safety findings observed in the clinical trial, the increase in 
the tadalafil exposure seen with the first dose of 
tipranavir/ritonavir administration suggests that the 
increase in tadalafil exposure might alter the tadalafil 
safety profile.  Therefore, the use of tadalafil should be 
avoided during the first 7-10 days of tipranavir/ritonavir 
dosing.  After steady-state is achieved with 
tipranavir/ritonavir, tadalafil can be administered without 
dose modification.

200 mg twice daily led to an increased exposure of CBZ 
and of its active metabolite by about 20 %, however no 
significant effect was observed with CBZ 100 mg twice 
daily. It could also be extrapolated that higher doses of 
CBZ may result in larger decreases in TPV plasma 
concentrations, which may further lead to reduced antiviral 
efficacy. Therefore, the CHMP considered that caution is 
required when co-administering TPV/RTV with high doses of 
CBZ.

several metabolism-involved enzymes and transporters. To 
this end, a "Cocktail" of either isozyme or transporter 
specific biomarkers is administered in healthy human 
volunteers who are given the active under investigation 
(here tipranavir/r) as well.  
The results of this study are summarised as such: Over the 
first few doses of TPV/r moderate inhibition of CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C9 occurred, moderate inhibition of p-glycoprotein 
occurred and potent inhibition of CYP2D6 and hepatic and 
intestinal CYP3A occurred. Intestinal P-glycoprotein and 
CYP3A activity were more profoundly affected than hepatic 
P-glycoprotein and CYP3A activity. 
Prolonged TPV/r exposure induced the activity of CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, hepatic and intestinal P- glycoprotein, and hepatic 
and intestinal CYP3A, whereas prolonged exposure further 
inhibited CYP2D6 activity. At steady-state, modest net 
induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 occurred, and potent 
inhibition of CYP2D6 and hepatic and intestinal CYP3A 
occurred. The net effect on P-glycoprotein, as measured by 
digoxin, was decreased compared to baseline conditions.

response was to a very high degree dependant on the use 
of enfuvirtide for the first time in the optimised background 
regimen. Additionally, the analysis showed that mutations 
on the protease gene that also occur with the use of other, 
more widely used protease inhibitors may lead to loss of 
virological response during tipranavir treatment. Therefore, 
a sentence was added in section 4.1 to draw special 
attention to the need for careful evaluation of a patient's 
genotype prior to initialisation of tipranavir/ritonavir.   
A regression analysis was performed to determine which 
mutation score was most predictive of virological and 
therapeutic response in patients participating in the 
RESIST-1 and -2 trials. As this analysis proved the so called 
tipranavir mutation score to be the most relevant, it is now 
reflected in the SPC to allow treating physicians to make 
the most informed choice on starting tipranavir treatment 
based on genotyping of their patients.

naïve patients showed that tipranavir/ritonavir should not 
be used in this patient population. This conclusion was 
based on the fact that in the treatment arm where 
tipranavir was given together with 200mg ritonavir twice 
daily as currently approved for experienced patients, the 
safety profile was unfavourable as compared to the 
comparator arm (lopinavir/ritonavir) without having 
additional benefits. Therefore, this arm was closed 
prematurely. In the second tipranavir arm where ritonavir 
was given at 100mg twice daily, the safety profile was 
more favourable. However, non-inferiority could not be 
shown to the comparator. Consequently, this arm was 
stopped as well. Tipranavir/ritonavir should not be used in 
antiretroviral naïve patients, as the benefit risk balance in 
this population was found to be negative.

provided by the MAH, the CHMP concluded that there is a 
signal for increased rates of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) 
in tipranavir/ritonavir-exposed patients. The rate of ICH in 
tipranavir-exposed patients appears to be higher than the 
ones seen in the nevirapine and enfuvirtide clinical 
development programs but in the range of the rate 
reported in the literature from clinical cohorts of HIV-
infected persons. In many of the tipranavir/ritonavir-

ICH was noted on review of the individual case reports. 
However, in the six remaining cases of the case-by-case 
analysis, the role of tipranavir/ritonavir in the ICH event 
could not be excluded. Due to the serious nature of these 
ICH events with an expected mortality rate of 
approximately 50% these findings require further 
evaluation.  
The added wording to the SPC and PL reflects the current 
state of knowledge and is well accompanied by the Dear 
Doctor Letter to inform prescribers about this safety signal. 
The benefit risk balance for tipranavir remains favourable, 
although all bleeding adverse events must be carefully 
monitored and all findings should be cumulatively 
presented in future PSURs.

atazanavir (300 mg once daily) is not recommended. This 
is due to the PK interaction of the combination leading to a 
significant reduction in atazanavir levels, as well as 
substantial increase of tipranavir and ritonavir exposure. 
Therefore, the co-administration of atazanavir and 
tipranavir should be strictly discouraged. It cannot be 
excluded that the effects of the medicinal products on each 
other would be more pronounced if they were to be 
administered at both their recommended dosages 
(tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily & 
atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily). Therefore, 
further studies to explore dose adjustments would be very

Therefore the CHMP agreed in his opinion on the granting 
of a marketing authorisation for Aptivus under exceptional 
cirmcumstances during September 2005 CHMP on 
introducing strong warnings and stringent monitoring of 
liver tests prior and during treatment as specified in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. The proposed wording 
in the PL corresponds to the information already included 
within section 4.8 "Undesirable Effects" of the SPC, in which 
hepatitis and hepatic failure (including fatal outcome) are 
listed as expected adverse reactions, under the frequency 
category 'uncommon' and 'rare', respectively. Furthermore, 
the advice to be observant for signs and symptoms of 
hepatitis reflects the advice already given in section 4.4 
"Special Warnings and Precautions for Use" of the SPC. 
Addition of this information to the PL clearly highlights and 
more accurately informs the patient of the potential risk of 
hepatitis and hepatic failure. The potential risk to all 
patients, not just those higher risk patients with baseline 
prognostic factors, is thereby better and more accurately 
described.

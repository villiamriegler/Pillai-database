1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Celgene Europe BV submitted on 20 December 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Inrebic, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 March 2018. 
Inrebic, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/794 on 1/10/2010, EU/3/10/810 and 
EU/3/10/811 on 26/11/2010 in the following conditions:  
• 
• 
• 
for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis (EU/3/10/794),  
for the treatment of post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis (EU/3/10/810),  
for the treatment of post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis (EU/3/10/811) 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Inrebic is indicated for the treatment of disease-
related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia 
vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis, who are JAK inhibitor naïve or 
have been treated with ruxolitinib.” 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Inrebic as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:

14 April 2011          EMEA/H/SA/2107/1/2011/PA/II 
Dr Pierre Demolis; Dr Bertil Jonsson 
The Protocol assistance pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
 
 
 
the adequacy of the Phase 1 efficacy, safety and PK data to support the two selected dosages of 
400 mg and 500 mg for the pivotal Phase 3 trial;  
the proposed definitions of response, response rate (RR), progression and progression-free survival 
(PFS), based on modification of the IWG-MRT criteria. 
the proposed design of the randomised, placebo controlled 3-arm Phase 3 trial in patients with 
myelofibrosis who are either Intermediate-2 or High Risk by IWG-MRT criteria and whether RR with 
symptom improvement assessed at 24 weeks could support a MAA; 
  whether positive results in at least one of the dose arms in the proposed single pivotal study would 
be sufficient for approval.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, 
post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. Patients can 
be either JAK inhibitor naïve or have been previously treated with ruxolitinib. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that can present as an apparently de novo 
disorder termed primary MF (PMF) or evolve from other MPNs and can be termed secondary MF, post 
polycythaemia Vera MF (Post PV-MF) or post essential thrombocythaemia MF (Post ET-MF). 
Myelofibrosis has an incidence of about 0.58 new cases per 100,000 person-years, but a higher 
prevalence of 6 per 100,000 person-years because of its chronic and disabling course. Median age at 
diagnosis is 67 years, without any significant difference in distribution between the sexes (Visser et al, 
2012 1). Median survival ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5 years, and the most frequent cause of 
death in patients with MF is transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (20%). Most patients die 
because of other disease-related events, such as progression without transformation, infections, and 
thrombo-haemorrhagic complications. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Primary myelofibrosis is a member of a group of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-negative MPNs, which 
also includes PV and ET. MPNs are considered to arise from a somatic mutation of a pluripotent 
haematopoietic progenitor cell, but the exact cause of is unknown. Almost all patients with PV and 
about one half of patients with ET and PMF have a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation, typically 
JAK2V617F mutation. Increased JAK2 signaling, evidenced by constitutively phosphorylated signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), is not strictly dependent on the presence of 
JAK2V617F mutation. Other mutations in patients with PMF include calreticulin (CALR) and 
myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) (Tefferi, 2016 2). About 10% of patients with PMF 
have no detectable mutation in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are termed “triple negative” (Tefferi, 2016). 
Mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) signaling pathway (Romano, 20173), resulting in cell proliferation and inhibition of 
cell death and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. It is less clear how the driver 
mutations that are present in earlier myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as essential thrombocythemia 
or polycythemia vera, evolve to the more advanced phases of myelofibrosis. Factors may include 
epigenetic changes; additional somatic mutations in other genes, such as additional sex combs like 1

(ASXL1), ten-eleven translocation–2 (TET2), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2); and 
contributions of the bone marrow microenvironment, particularly regarding inflammation. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis prognosis 
Myeloproliferative myelofibrosis can present as a de novo disorder (PMF) or evolve secondarily from 
previous polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia (Post-PV MF or Post-ET MF respectively). 
Post-PV MF and post-ET MF are both clinically indistinguishable from PMF and develop from prior PV 
and ET due to fibrotic transformation and progressive bone marrow fibrosis (Sangle, 2014 4). These 
conditions are clinically named MPN-associated myelofibrosis (MF). Regardless of whether 
myelofibrosis is primary or secondary, the disease is characterised by a clonal haemopoietic stem cell 
proliferation associated with associated with reactive bone marrow fibrosis, osteosclerosis, 
angiogenesis, extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) and abnormal cytokine expression. Cytokine 
elevations in MF occur regardless of mutational status or disease subtype and MF is considered to be a 
condition with a considerable inflammatory potential (Lussana, 2017 5). Clinical manifestations in PMF 
include severe anemia, marked hepatosplenomegaly, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fatigue, night 
sweats, fever, weight loss), bone marrow reticulin and collagen fibrosis, cachexia, bone pain, splenic 
infarct, pruritus, thrombosis and bleeding. Ineffective erythropoiesis and EMH are the main causes of 
anemia and organomegaly, respectively. Other disease complications include symptomatic portal 
hypertension that might lead to variceal bleeding or ascites and non-hepatosplenic EMH that might 
lead to cord compression, ascites, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension or diffuse extremity pain. 
It is currently assumed that aberrant cytokine production by clonal cells and host immune reaction 
contribute to PMF associated bone marrow stromal changes, ineffective erythropoiesis, EMH, cachexia 
and constitutional symptoms. Causes of death include leukemic progression that occurs in 
approximately 20% of patients but many patients also die of comorbid conditions including 
cardiovascular events and consequences of cytopenias including infection or bleeding (Tefferi 20162, 
Stahl 20176).  
A diagnosis of MPN is based on the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and 
requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic, and molecular testing (O’ Sullivan, 20186). 
This includes the presence of 1 of the 3 driver mutations (JAK2, CALR and MPL). In patients with triple-
negative disease, the detection of one of the associated somatic mutations (eg, EZH2, TET2, IDH1/2, 
ASXL1, SRSF2, or SF3B1) suffices as the presence of a clonal marker for diagnostic purposes. Because 
the natural course of secondary MF (post-PV MF and post-ET MF) may differ from that of PMF, the 
diagnosis of post-PV or post-ET MF should adhere to criteria published by the International Working 
Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) (O’ Sullivan, 20187; Tefferi, 20162). 
Several prognostic scoring systems have been developed to facilitate risk assessment for patients with 
MF. The prognostic scorings were originally developed for primary MF, but the same models and 
parameters are applied in post-PV and post-ET MF, partly because the therapeutic approach is quite 
similar. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is used to predict survival at diagnosis, 
and the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) is used to predict survival at any 
time during the disease. Variables included in the IPSS are age > 65 years, constitutional symptoms, 
haemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) counts > 25 x 109/L and circulating blast

frequency ≥1%. DIPSS puts more emphasis on anaemia. DIPSS Plus incorporates 3 additional 
independent risk factors: platelet count < 100 x 109/L, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion need, and 
unfavourable karyotype (Gangat, 20118). A strong association between DIPSS Plus risk category and 
overall survival (OS) for MF patients has been reported; intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk 
disease has been associated with median survival of 6.5, 2.9, and 1.3 years, respectively (Gangat, 
20117; Tefferi, 20162). Approximately 90% of individuals with MF are in the intermediate or high-risk 
categories according to DIPSS Plus (Gangat, 20117), comprising a large population with symptomatic 
disease and shortened survival and representing the greatest unmet medical need. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) is the only treatment that is potentially curative and can 
induce long-term remission in patients with MF (Barbui, 2018 9; Vannucchi, 201710). However, the 
majority of MF patients are not eligible for the procedure due to age, comorbidities and an overall frail 
condition (Stahl, 20175; Vannucchi, 201710). Therefore, the existing treatment options are primarily 
symptom oriented. Treatment goals include reduction of spleen size, improvement of cytopenias and 
symptom burden, reduction of bone marrow fibrosis, restoration of transfusion-independence, and 
prevention and delay of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Stahl, 20175; Vannucchi, 
201710).  
The selection of appropriate treatment is based on the risk score and presence of symptoms (European 
LeukemiaNet (ELN), Barbui, 20189; the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice 
guidelines, Vannucchi 201511). For patients with intermediate-risk 2 or high-risk score and not eligible 
for alloSCT, ruxolitinib is the core treatment of MF. Ruxolitinib (Jakavi), a JAK1/2 inhibitor, which is the 
only centrally approved drug in the EU for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms 
in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential 
thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. It improves splenomegaly symptoms in patients with intermediate-
2–risk and high-risk myelofibrosis (COMFORT-II study Cervantes, 201312). It is also used in patients 
with symptomatic intermediate-1–risk myelofibrosis who are not responding or are intolerant to 
hydroxyurea. Whether ruxolitinib improves survival is uncertain, as meta-analyses have not been able 
to conclude on estimates of survival advantage of ruxolitinib and the benefit of ruxolitinib is currently 
seen as being control of splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms (Barbui, 20189). Other therapeutic 
options for MF include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), corticosteroids, danazol, and 
immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide) for improvement of 
anaemias and hydroxyurea and interferon for the treatment of splenomegaly and/or constitutional 
symptoms (Stahl, 20175). Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only approved on a national basis in a few 
countries (e.g. France, Italy, Sweden and Spain) in the EU. Splenectomy and splenic irradiation are 
treatment options in refractory disease and disease specific complications (Tefferi 20162).

Currently, there is no approved treatment option or standard of care for patients who have been 
treated with ruxolitinib, and the prognosis for these patients is poor with median survival of 6 to 16 
months (Kuykendall, 201813; Newberry, 201714). 
About the product 
Pharmacological classification 
Fedratinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with activity against wild type and mutationally activated JAK2 and 
fibromyalgia syndrome-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). It belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group: 
Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE57. 
Note: Fedratinib is also known as SAR302503 or TG101348. 
Mode of action 
Fedratinib is a JAK2-selective inhibitor with higher inhibitory activity for JAK2 over family members 
JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2. Abnormal activation of JAK2 is associated with MPNs, including MF and PV. In 
cell models expressing mutationally active JAK2V617F or FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), 
fedratinib reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3/5) 
proteins, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptotic cell death. In mouse models of JAK2V617F -
driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT3/5, and improved 
survival, white blood cell counts, haematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. 
Claimed indication and recommendation for use 
The initial claimed indication was: 
Fedratinib is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis: 
•  who are JAK inhibitor naïve 
•  who have been treated with ruxolitinib 
The agreed indication is: “ Inrebic is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or 
symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post 
essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis who are Janus Associated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor naïve or 
have been treated with ruxolitinib.” 
The proposed dose of fedratinib is 400 mg once daily. Treatment may be continued for as long as 
patients derive benefit.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fedratinib is benzenesulfonamide, N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-[[5-methyl-2-[[4-[2-
(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]amino]-4-pyrimidinyl]amino]-, hydrochloride, hydrate (1:2:1) 
corresponding to the molecular formula C27H36N6O3S∙2HCl ∙H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 
615.62 (dihydrochloride monohydrate) and the following structure: 
Figure 1: fedratinib active substance structure 
The chemical structure of fedratinib was elucidatedby a combination of elemental analysis, nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV), Fourier 
Transform infrared spectrophotometry. The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by single crystal X-ray analysis, dynamic vapor sorption, scanning electron microscopy 
differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermogravimetric analysis, and 
particle size distribution (PSD). 
Fedratinib is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic crystalline solid that exhibits pH-dependent aqueous 
solubility: it is freely soluble in acidic buffers and practically insoluble in neutral buffer (pH 6.8).  
Fedratinib does not have chiral centres and does not exhibit stereoisomerism.

Polymorphism has been observed for fedratinib. Several polymorphic solid forms of the fedratinib 
active substance have been identified.  As confirmed by x-ray powder diffraction pattern analysis, the 
proposed manufacturing process of fedratinb consistently yields the desired polymorphic form, which is 
the thermodynamically stable form. The desired polymorph is controlled at release and monitored in 
stability studies.In response to a MO, the NAS status of fedratinib has been adequately demonstrated 
during the procedure: no previously authorised medicinal products were identified using structural and 
CAS number searches.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Fedratinib is manufactured in several steps using a convergent synthetic process. In case of 
unexpected deviation or out of specification results, any intermediate or active substance batch can be 
reprocessed in accordance with ICH Q7 guideline by repeating all or part of the related process; this is 
accepted. 
Fedratinib is synthesised using well defined commercially available starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. In response to a major objection (MO), one of the proposed starting materials has been 
adequately justified in line ICH Q11.The starting material in question has defined chemical properties 
and structure. It is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the active 
substance and it is a commodity in pre-existing non-pharmaceutical market. The step upstream does 
not impact the impurity profile of the active substance. Batch analysis data of starting material show 
that the level of impurities is low. 
For the non-critical process parameters, target settings are provided in line with ICH Q11. The normal 
operating ranges (NORs) are within proven acceptable ranges (PARs), which have been justified using 
a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD by performing a risk 
assessment.  The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data 
from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Fedratinib is non-mutagenic. During the assessment, in response to a MO on the evaluation and 
assessment of potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs), data have been provided confirming that three 
impurities presenting the sulfonylchloride alerting structure, are present at the level below 30% of the 
TTC (Threshold of Toxicological Concern) in seven consecutive batches of the process intermediate 
Additionally, the three PGIs are controlled at the level of the starting material and/or as process 
intermediate, in line with Option 3 of ICH M7. Overall, the proposed control strategy for the discussed 
potential genotoxic impurities is acceptable. 
All potential residues of solvents are either demonstrated to be absent, or sufficiently controlled by 
IPCs or in the active substance specification. A palladium catalyst is used in the synthesis. Potential 
residues are controlled at a specified level. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the 
synthesis. Several intermediate impurities and the assay limits h have been tightened during the 
procedure, as requested. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented and are satisfactory. 
The synthetic route for the active substance has remained essentially unchanged from the beginning of 
development; changes to improve the purity profile of the active substance were made by the 
manufacturer of the clinical batches and minor improvements were made during the transfer to the 
proposed commercial site. As demonstrated by batch data the only difference between the batches 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 16/170 
 
 
 
manufactured by the proposed commercial manufacturer and earlier batches is a decrease in impurity 
level. 
The active substance is packaged in in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags which complies with 
the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, , includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, IR (Ph. 
Eur.), XRPD (Ph. Eur.)), chloride content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC, anhydrous solvent free basis), 
starting material content (HPLC), related impurities (HPLC), water content (KF; Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (isopropanol and benzene GC), isopropyl chloride content (GC) and PSD 
(laser light diffraction; Ph. Eur.). 
The specification limit set for the starting material conforms to the ICH Q3A qualification level; the 
control of impurities is in line with ICH Q3 for the specified and unspecified impurities. 
Isopropanol, used throughout the synthesis and in the final crystallisation step, is controlled as residual 
solvent, together with benzene, a Class 1 solvent, that is potentially present as an impurity in alcohol 
solvents and in isopropanol. Isopropyl chloride is controlled in the specification at a limitwhich is below 
the TTC The absence of a test for palladium in the active substance specification is justified as it is 
controlled in an active substance intermediate during the synthesis. Testing of elemental impurities is 
not necessary in light of the risk assessment performed in accordance with the ICH Q3D. The absence 
of this test is deemed acceptable in accordance with the NfG ICH Q6A, Decision Tree #6. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines the applicant is recommended to modify 
the analytical method for determination of assay and related substances in fedratinib active substance 
(REC 1). 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurity testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 6 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer and 
three clinical pilot scale batches according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested 
parameters were within the specifications and no trend was observed.  
Photostability testing, using conditions equivalent to three times those described ICH Q1B, was 
performed on one batch. Batch data from forced degradation studies performed under acid, base, 
oxidation and thermal stress conditions were also provided on one batch. Degradation was quite 
modest in most forced degradation conditions; however, degradation was observed in oxidative 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container, 
with no additional storage conditions.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as an immediate release hard capsule containing 100 mg of 
fedratinib (as fedratinib dihydrochloride monohydrate). The finished product composition is provided. 
The composition of the capsule shell components and of the printing ink – 00A1 White have been 
provided. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards with the exception of silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) which complies with USP-NF 
and contains microcrystalline cellulose and silica colloidal anhydrous, which are of Ph. Eur. quality. 
SMCC is used in a number of centralised products and its specification is acceptable. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements.  
Compatibility with the excipients of the proposed formulation has been confirmed.  
Fedratinib capsules are manufactured using a process which includes blending and encapsulation. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated. The proposed QC dissolution 
method conditions have been defined. During the procedure the applicant has demonstrated that other 
dissolution conditions or the use of a different apparatus exhibited greater variability than the 
proposed method, additionally they did not result in an improvement of the discriminatory power. In 
conclusion, the development of the dissolution method is considered sufficiently described. Although, 
the proposed QC dissolution method was not shown to be discriminatory towards the applied deliberate 
changes based on the data provided, the test method together with the agreed dissolution limit, which 
have been tightened in response to a MO are considered adequate for its intended purpose.  
The formulation used during pivotal clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing 
differences in clinical trial batches did not lead to differences in dissolution. 
The finished product batches for pivotal clinical study, also used for supportive stability data, were 
produced by a different manufacturer from the proposed commercial manufacturer, using a 
comparable manufacturing process. The comparability between the capsules manufactured by the two 
sites has been demonstrated with an in vitro comparative dissolution study. The primary packaging is 
high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with polypropylene child resistant cap and heat induction seal. 
The material complies with EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several steps including blending and encapsulation. The process 
is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
During the procedure the PARs have been redefined. The claimed ranges are acceptable. The PARs are 
considered acceptable based on the available development data, which confirmed that the finished 
product CQAs were not affected within the evaluated ranges. 
The manufacturing process has been satisfactorily validated and validation data on three full scale 
consecutive batched have been provided. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 18/170 
 
 
 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this of type of pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual), identification (UV and HPLC), assay HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF- Ph. Eur.) and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The release and end of shelf life limits are the same for all involved parameters except water content. 
The dissolution limit is set based on dissolution profiles of relevant clinical batches and it has been 
updated during the procedure in response to a MO.  
The control of impurities is in line with ICH Q3B (R2). Residual solvents are tested at the level of the 
active substance, as the manufacturing process of the finished product does not utilise any solvent, 
this is accepted. The desired polymorphic form is routinely tested only in the active substance since it 
has been demonstrated that it does not change during finished product manufacture and storage. The 
omission of the polymorphic form test is considered as justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach, in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
three batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
To address an MO, a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished 
product has been performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, the applicant is recommended to modify the analytical 
method for determination of assay and related substances in fedratinib finished product (REC 2). 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for nine commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of finished product stored under long term conditions and under accelerated conditions 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing and are representative to those proposed for marketing, 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 19/170 
 
 
 
Stability data from 1 pilot scale batch of finished product, stored under long term conditions and under 
accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines were also provided.  
Additional stability data pilot scale batches manufactured by the manufacturer of the clinical batches 
stored under long term conditions and under accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines 
were also provided. 
Samples were tested for the specification tests.  
No  significant  changes  have  been  observed  in  the  data  from  the  formal  stability  studies,  further 
confirming the comparability between the clinical material and the proposed commercial product. 
In addition, one batches was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. No changes were observed. 
Samples of the finished product were exposed to forced degradation under acid, base, oxidation and 
thermal stress conditions. Mass balance was confirmed under the stress conditions; the analytical 
procedures used were shown to be stability indicating. 
Gelatin capsule shells are known to be sensitive to very high, but also to very low humidity conditions. 
Therefore, the precautionary storage condition “Keep the bottle tightly closed in order to protect from 
moisture” has been added. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on Declaration of Storage 
Conditions and is acceptable. An in-use stability study was not performed as there is no indication from 
stability and/or stress studies that the finished product may be susceptible to degradation under long 
term, and hence in-use, conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years without any special storage 
condition but with the recommendation “Keep the bottle tightly closed in order to protect from 
moisture.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the capsule shells of the finished product. Valid TSE 
CEP from the suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The MO raised during the procedure on the suitability of a 
starting material has been addressed by further justifying its suitability and no redefinition was 
needed. Satisfactory data have been provided confirming that the proposed control strategy is 
adequate with regards to the control of three PGIs, in line with Option 3 of ICH M7, and hence 
additional controls were not deemed needed in response to a MO raised. To address a MO, the 
dissolution acceptance criteria for the finished product have been tightened. In response to a MO, a 
satisfactory risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed confirming that no risk has been identified. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Additionally, in response to a MO, the NAS status has been adequately substantiated. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to assay and related

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In a cell free enzyme activity assay, fedratinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of wild-type and 
mutant (V617F) JAK2, with IC50 values ranging from 1.26 – 12 nM in different assays. Also FLT3 is 
potently inhibited with an IC50 of 15 nM. The Janus family kinases were further investigated in 2 
different assays. JAK3 and TYK2 showed much reduced potency with at least 38-fold reduced IC50 
values, and concordance between the experiments. However, for JAK1 IC50 values varied from 13 to 
45.5 µM in these assays. The lowest IC50 value of 13 nM is only 6-fold higher than the IC50 of JAK2 
and in the same range as FLT3. The main difference appears to be the ATP concentration used in the 
assays, being 140 µM for the lowest IC50 and 10 µM for the highest. These data could indicate that 
fedratinib also has inhibitory effect via JAK1. However, in a further study evaluating the effect of 
fedratinib on cellular proliferation, it was shown that the IC50 for JAK2 was 0.36 µM, whereas no IC50 
was reached in the test system for JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2. It can therefore be concluded that within the 
Janus family of kinases, fedratinib has high affinity for JAK2 inhibition, although some activity against 
JAK1 cannot be ruled out.

Fedratinib inhibited cell proliferation of patient derived (human erythroid leukaemia) or transgenic 
mouse JAK2 expressing cells harbouring the most commonly found mutation V617F, with EC50 values 
ranging from 0.27 – 0.94 µM. The inhibition of cell proliferation is caused by reduced STAT5 
phosphorylation and leads to apoptosis of cells. Similar results were obtained from experiments with 
JAK2V617F positive patient derived PV HSCs. Erythroid colonies that were formed were largely 
eliminated by treatment with fedratinib with an EC50 of less than 0.3 µM. These results indicate that 
fedratinib can induce an anti-tumour effect through binding to the mutant JAK2 receptor.

Three metabolites of fedratinib were identified, SAR317753, SAR317793, and SAR317981. In terms of 
inhibition of cellular proliferation tested in patient derived JAK2V617F-expressing cell lines, the most 
active metabolite SAR317981was about 2-fold less active than fedratinib. SAR317753 and SAR317793 
were at least 10-fold less active. 
Table 3: Antiproliferative activity of fedratinib and its metabolites in patient-derived 
JAK2V617F-expressing cell lines 
Resistance to fedratinib seems limited. While common mutations in JAK2 confer resistance to other JAK 
inhibitors, there was only a 2 to 3-fold increase in EC50 for fedratinib. Induced resistant clones 
obtained from patient derived cell lines endogenously expressing JAK2V617F were about 10-fold less 
sensitive to fedratinib but harboured no missense mutations. Despite the lack of mutations, increased 
phosphorylation of JAK1 and 2, and STAT3/5 was shown, indicating increased downstream signalling. 
The mechanism of resistance formation is unknown.  
Different AML cell lines were used to investigate the effect of fedratinib on cells with mutations other 
than JAK2V617F. Cell lines harbouring the internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the FLT3 
receptor (FLT3-ITD) were particularly sensitive to treatment with fedratinib, with EC50 values ranging 
from 57 to 69 nM. Reduced phosphorylation of the receptor and of downstream effector molecules 
STAT5, Erk and Akt, as well as increased apoptosis was shown in a dose dependent manner. Together 
with the high affinity for the FLT3 receptor, it can be concluded that fedratinib has the potential to 
induce an anti-tumour effect through binding to FLT3-ITD.  
Several cell lines harbouring other mutant proteins or receptors were also tested for their 
responsiveness to fedratinib. All cell lines responded to treatment with EC50 values to around 1 µM.  
Numerous in vivo mouse models have been used to investigate the efficacy of fedratinib. In a bone 
marrow transplantation model in which mice injected with JAK2V617F transduced haematopoietic cells, a 
positive effect on survival, WBC counts, and splenomegaly was observed after 6 weeks treatment from 
the lowest dose tested of 60 mg/kg BID fedratinib. Mutant cells were reduced in the spleen at this 
dose, but a higher dose of 120 mg/kg BID was needed to also reduce these cells in bone marrow. A 
similar effect on spleen size was seen in JAK2V617F knock-in mice, also at 60 mg/kg BID. However, 
treatment of up to 120 mg/kg BID did not eliminate disease-initiating JAK2V617F cells, either in the 
transplantation or knock-in model.

Two studies with of JAK2V617F or wild-type JAK2 human cells in a xenograft mouse model using 
intrahepatic administration showed reduction of erythroid engraftment of JAK2V617F mutant cells. No 
reduction of wild-type JAK2 cells was seen, while in vitro experiments indicate that fedratinib is also a 
potent inhibitor of wild-type JAK2. It is not clear what is the cause of this discrepancy between in vitro 
and in vivo results, but specificity for mutant JAK2 is favourable. Also no reduction of thymic 
engraftment of JAK2V617F cells was seen. This indicates that fedratinib only inhibits myeloid progenitor 
cells. There was only one high dose level of 150 mg/kg BID used in these studies. Other xenograft 
studies used subcutaneous administration of human SET-2 cells, heterozygous for the JAK2V617F allele. 
Single doses of up to 120 mg/kg showed 3 to 4-fold higher concentration of fedratinib within the 
tumour as compared to blood. JAK2 downstream signalling was reduced as shown by reduction of 
STAT5 and STAT3 phosphorylation, with EC50 values of 3490 ng/ml and 3230 ng/ml respectively. 
Dosing for 2 weeks in this xenograft model demonstrated a reduced tumour volume from 80.9 mg/kg 
BID fedratinib and higher. A dose of 53.9 mg/kg BID or lower had no significant effect on tumour 
volume. 
In a disseminated mouse tumour model where mice were injected Ba/F3-JAK2V617F-GFP cells 
intravenously, survival was increased and circulating tumour cell burden was reduced from 80 mg/kg 
BID and higher. Lower doses (40 mg/kg BID) had no effect on these parameters, although a reduction 
in STAT5 phosphorylation was already seen after a dose of 40 mg/kg BID fedratinib. 
A single xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effect of fedratinib on human AML cells 
harbouring the FLT3-ITD mutation. The tumour volume was tracked over time and showed a reduced 
growth in the low dose group of 60 mg/kg BID. This indicates that although growth of the tumour is 
slower as compared to vehicle, treatment of 60 mg/kg BID still allows for the tumour to grow. 
Complete regression was however demonstrated in the high dose group of 120 mg/kg BID.

Figure 4: Oral administration of fedratinib inhibits tumour growth in MV411 xenograft model 
Overall the in vivo mouse model studies indicate that fedratinib reduced downstream signalling 
through mutated JAK2 and FLT3, resulting in reduced tumour volume, growth or engraftment, and 
reduced splenomegaly. These effects were evident at doses from 60 mg/kg BID or higher, while lower 
doses had no effect. Although no kinetic data is available for these studies, extrapolation from other 
mouse data indicate that high concentrations are required to show an effect in these mouse models. 
The Cavg and Cmax at the effective mouse dose of 60 mg/kg BID would be around 1700 ng/ml and 
3500 ng/ml respectively, while human Cavg and Cmax at the MRHD is only 1213 ng/ml and 2022 
ng/ml respectively. It should also be noted that at the mentioned mouse plasma concentrations, 
growth of AML tumour cells was still possible, and 2-fold higher doses were required for complete 
regression. Further, when in vitro IC50 values are compared to in vivo data there appears to be a large 
difference. While in vitro effects on cell proliferation and downstream signalling were evident at EC50 
values around 300 nM, the in vivo concentration needed for an effect appears to be 10-fold higher 
(Cavg of 1700 ng/ml corresponds to 3.24 µM).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A screen has been performed to assess the binding of fedratinib to a panel of receptors and 
transporters. Significant binding was observed at the M1 and M5 muscarinic receptors and at the 
dopamine transporter, with IC50 values of 33 nM, 21 nM and 36 nM respectively.  
It should be noted that a substantial number of other receptors was also inhibited by fedratinib at 
concentrations ranging from 150 to 730 nM. Although this is within the range of EC50 values for cell 
proliferation and downstream effects through JAK2 and FLT3, a comparison to a cell free system in 
which IC50 values of 3-12 nM and 15 nM for JAK2 and FLT3 were reported, is more appropriate. It can 
therefore be concluded that other than M1 and M5 muscarinic receptors and dopamine transporter, no 
other significant inhibition of fedratinib is evident. 
Due to reports of clinical cases of encephalopathy in patients receiving fedratinib, and the link between 
thiamine deficiency and encephalopathy, a direct effect of fedratinib on thiamine transporters was 
investigated. In vitro results show an IC50 for both thiamine transporters THTr1 and THTr2 of >300 
µM.  
In a 28-day rat study, normal rats treated with fedratinib were compared to a thiamine deficient (TD) 
rat model and TD rat model treated with fedratinib, as well as controls. Results indicate that fedratinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 27/170 
 
 
 
 
 
had no effect on TD progression in the model, or on thiamine status of the animals. A further GLP 28-
day rat study was conducted to evaluate thiamine levels in plasma and brain after fedratinib treatment 
up to 80 mg/kg/day. No effect on thiamine levels was observed. These results indicate that fedratinib 
has no direct inhibitory effect on the thiamine transporter. Of note, at the highest dose tested, the 
exposure was only about 0.25-fold the human exposure at the recommended dose. However, the 
results together with the in vitro data suggesting very high IC50 values for thiamine transporters, and 
the lack of effect on thiamine levels in the clinic after fedratinib treatment are sufficient to exclude a 
direct inhibitory effect of fedratinib on the thiamine transporter. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
After a single dose fedratinib of up to 30 mg/kg there were no effects on the central nervous system of 
rats as measured by the functional observation battery. However, the exposure in these rats is 
anticipated to be far below the human exposure at the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD), 
when extrapolated from other rat toxicokinetic data, with an exposure multiple of 0.05 based on AUC. 
This study therefore did not provide information relevant for the human situation.  
With regards to effects on the cardiovascular system, the hERG channel was inhibited with an IC50 of 
2.1 µM. In the in vivo dog study where no effects on cardiovascular parameters were observed, this 
IC50 concentration was presumably not reached, as the highest dose tested was 20 mg/kg which 
resulted in only 0.2-fold the human exposure at the MRHD based on Cmax (extrapolated from other 
dog TK data). Although the IC50 for the hERG channel is below the Cmax and Cavg in humans, there is 
high protein binding of at least 91% in human plasma. Therefore, the unbound Cmax in humans of 
around 0.35 µM is below the IC50 for hERG channel inhibition. Further, a dedicated clinical QT study 
was performed which showed no effect on the cardiac action potential.  
Effects on the respiratory system were evaluated in the same study as the dog cardiovascular study. 
Therefore, although no effects were observed on respiratory parameters, the exposure margin was too 
low (0.2 at best), and this study is not very informative. However, no effects on breathing were seen in 
the repeated dose toxicity studies, and no signs of effect on the respiratory system were seen in the 
clinical studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that fedratinib has no effect on the respiratory system. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies of pharmacodynamic drug interactions were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption was investigated in vitro and in vivo after single dose in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys and 
after repeated dose in mice, rats and dogs. Tissue distribution was investigated in rats. Metabolism 
was investigated in vitro and in vivo in mice, rats and dogs. Excretion was investigated in mass 
balance studies in mice, rats (intact and bile-duct cannulated rats) and dogs. Distribution to milk and 
placenta was not investigated. 
Methods of analysis 
In the toxicokinetic studies, fedratinib was analysed in plasma of mice, rats, dogs and rabbits with 
validated LC-MS/MS methods. The validation was adequate regarding calibration, accuracy, precision, 
LLOQ, carry-over, dilution integrity, matrix effect, selectivity and stability.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 28/170 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
In vitro apical to basolateral permeability in Caco-2 cells was high at pH 7.4 but very low at pH 6.5, at 
concentrations of 20 µM. At 100 µM, the permeability at pH 6.5 was markedly increased.  
After oral single dose administration, tmax was around 3 h for rats, dogs (except in one dog study 
where it was only 0.5-0.75 h) and monkeys and 1 h for mice. In rats, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 
approximately 2 times higher in fasted conditions compared to fed conditions. In fed dogs, uptake of 
fedratinib appears to be delayed compared to fasted dogs (tmax increased and Cmax decreased and 
no significant difference in AUC0-24). Volume of distribution was 32, 13.5-17.4, 22, and 10.7 L/kg in 
mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively, which implies a wide distribution beyond the total body 
water. Absolute oral bioavailability was 28 – 37% in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. After 
administration of fedratinib to the portal vein in rats, the exposure was approximately half the 
exposure compared to when fedratinib was administered into the femoral vein, indicating a first pass 
effect. Elimination half-life was longer in dogs and monkeys (9-11 h after IV and 18-19 h after oral 
administration) than in mice and rats (3-7 h after IV administration). Clearance after IV dosing was 
125 mL/min/kg in mice, 42-46 mL/min/kg in rats, 38 mL/min/kg in dogs and 19 mL/min/kg in 
monkeys. Since only males were used in these studies, no conclusion can be drawn regarding gender 
differences after a single dose. 
After repeated oral administration of up to 30 mg/kg/day, fedratinib exposure increased more than 
dose-proportionally in mice and rats (mice up to 11x more than the dose increase, rat up to nearly 5x 
more than the dose increase), while this was less clear at higher doses. Exposure in dogs increased 
more than dose-proportionally (up to 8x more than the dose increase). Also, in pregnant rats and in 
pregnant rabbits the exposure increased more than dose-proportionally (up to 11-12x more than the 
dose increase). No explanation was given for the high maximal exposure increases. However, all 
exposures, including those at the highest doses, were lower than the human exposure. In pregnant 
rats, the exposure was somewhat lower than in non-pregnant rats. In rats and mice, the exposure was 
slightly higher in females than in males, approximately 2-fold at maximum. In dogs, no clear gender 
difference was visible. No accumulation was observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study. In rats and 
dogs, slight accumulation was observed, but no more than approximately 2-fold. In pregnant rats, no 
accumulation was observed between gestation days 6 and 17. In pregnant rabbits, the exposure was 
increased at gestation day 18 compared to gestation day 6 (approximately 2-4-fold).

Table 5: Fedratinib plasma pharmacokinetic parameters after single dose in various species 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of fedratinib was slightly higher in humans (91-96%) than in mice, rats, 
rabbits, dogs and monkeys (83-89%). Protein binding in human plasma was not concentration 
dependent up to 5000 ng/mL, but slightly lower binding was observed at 10000 ng/mL.Fedratinib was 
highly bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (98%) and moderately bound to human serum albumin (57%). 
Protein binding to human serum albumin was not concentration dependent. Protein binding to α1-acid 
glycoprotein appears to show saturation at concentrations ≥ 5000 ng/mL. 
Some distribution of fedratinib-derived radioactivity into red blood cells was observed in rats and dogs 
(blood to plasma ratio 1.1-2.0 in rats and 1.1-1.2 in dogs). In humans, distribution into red blood cells 
was limited (blood to plasma ratio of 0.6 to 0.8). In rats, AUC was approximately 2-fold higher when 
calculated from concentrations in whole blood compared to plasma. Also t1/2 was increased when based 
on concentrations in whole blood, especially in females.   
Following single dose oral administration to rats, fedratinib was widely distributed in the body with the 
highest concentrations in the GI tract, the liver (tissue/plasma ratio 161-244 at 4 h post-dose), kidney 
(tissue/plasma ratio 93-256 at 4 h post-dose), spleen, lung, adrenal gland and thyroid. Maximum 
concentrations were found at 4 h after dosing for most tissues. Fedratinib distributed to the eye (uveal 
tract) and to pigmented skin. After 96h, fedratinib was still found in lacrimal glands, eye, kidney, liver 
and preputial gland. Fedratinib could still be found in the eye at 672 h (1 month) after dosing. The 
potential for phototoxicity has been studied and no phototoxic potential was found in vitro in 3T3 cells. 
Fedratinib distributed to the brain in low concentrations (concentrations lower than plasma 
concentrations at 4 h after dosing), but it eliminated slower from brain tissue than from plasma: 
following a single IV administration to rats, t1/2 from brain was 27 h, whereas it was 4.3 h from 
plasma. No studies were conducted regarding placental transfer and distribution into milk. Evidence of 
embryo-foetal toxicity was found in rats, indicating that fedratinib crosses the placenta.

Metabolism 
In vitro, the major compound found in human microsomes and in rat, dog and human hepatocytes was 
the parent compound (58-87% of total radioactivity). Four metabolic pathways were identified based 
on in vitro results. The major pathway in all species involved oxidations on the ethyl pyrrolidine moiety 
of fedratinib. Minor pathways found in all species were oxidation on the methyl-diphenylpyrimidine-
diamine group and oxidation on the terbutyl group of fedratinib. Direct glutathione conjugation was a 
fourth pathway, which was found in the rat but not in human. Main metabolites in humans were 
SAR317981 (pyrrolidone of fedratinib, 3.6-4.0% of total radioactivity), metabolite 7 (formed by 
hydroxylation on the ethyl pyrrolidone, 5.1-8.5% of total radioactivity) and metabolite 5 (aminophenol 
derivative of fedratinib, 4.2% of total radioactivity). These metabolites were formed by successive 
oxidations on the ethyl pyrrolidine moiety. SAR317981 and metabolite 7 were also found in rat and dog 
hepatocytes (SAR317981 at 1.8-3.6% and metabolite 7 at 1.2-2.9%). Metabolite 5 was found in rat 
(1.6%), but not in dog hepatocytes. All other human metabolites accounted for less than 3.5% of total 
radioactivity. SAR317981 was also found following incubation without NADPH, indicating that it was 
formed not (only) by CYP enzymes. Main metabolites in rats and dogs were SAR318031 (successive 
oxidations on pyrrolidine ethyl group leading to the carboxylic acid group, 16% in dog and 8.3% in rat) 
and SAR317753 (N-oxidation on the pyrrolidine ethyl group, 7.6% in dog and 5.5% in rat). 
Table 6: Relative percentage of fedratinib and metabolites in rat, dog and human 
hepatocytes and human microsomes (study MIV0640) 
In vivo metabolism was investigated in mice, rats and dogs. In all species, parent drug was the main 
circulating compound in plasma (66%, 79-88%, 72% and 80% of radioactivity AUC0-24h in mice, rats, 
dogs and humans respectively).

metabolite 20a (hydroxylation on methyl pyrimidine of SAR317981), representing 3.6-5.4% of 
radioactivity. In faeces of mice, 72-83% of the dose was excreted after 24 h; 4% of the dose was 
excreted in urine after 48 h. A total of 30-42% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug. Thirteen 
metabolites were found in the excreta of mice, among which the main one was SAR318031 (6.6-8.1% 
of dose). Other metabolites represented ≤ 5% of dose. No significant difference in metabolite profile 
was observed between C57Bl/6 and wild-type RasH2 mice.  
In rats, the main human metabolite SAR317981 was the only circulating metabolite, at 12-21% of 
radioactivity. SAR317981 was found in liver at 4 h after dosing (tissue:plasma ratio 156 and 55 in 
males and females resp.). In faeces of rats, 78-88% of the dose was excreted after 48h; 1.5% of the 
dose was excreted in urine after 24 h. A total of 39-55% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug. 
Thirteen metabolites were found in the excreta of rats, among which the main ones were SAR318031 
(10-11% of dose) and metabolite 17 (8.3-8.6% of dose). Other metabolites in excreta represented ≤ 
6% of dose. In bile of cannulated rats, 49% of the dose was excreted within 24 h, among which only 
1.2% as the parent compound. Three major phase II metabolites were found in bile: metabolite 19a 
(S-cysteine-glutamine derivative of glutathione conjugate of fedratinib) at 7.6% of dose, and 
metabolites 20 and 21c (glutathione and glucuronide conjugate derivatives of metabolite 5) at 4.6% 
and 7.0% of dose. In addition, SAR318031 and 2 other phase I metabolites were found in bile at 5%. 
The amount of 49% of dose found in bile, was higher than the oral bioavailability of 18-37%. It is 
possible that part of the absorbed fedratinib is metabolised immediately, but this does not match with 
approximately 80% parent compound in plasma.

In dogs, one major metabolite was found in plasma, M22a, an unidentified ultra-polar compound, at 
28% of radioactivity. In faeces of dogs, 87% of the dose was excreted after 48h; in urine, 0.5% of the 
dose was excreted after 48 h. A total of 21% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug. Eleven 
metabolites were found in the excreta of dogs, among which SAR317981 at 40% of the dose. Other 
metabolites in excreta represented ≤ 6% of the dose. The fact that of the 87% which was excreted in 
faeces, only 21% was unchanged drug suggests that fedratinib, after having been absorbed, 
undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily to metabolite SAR318031, to be excreted in the 
faeces. This explains why in faeces there is a low proportion of unchanged drug, while the 
bioavailability of fedratinib is also relatively low. In humans, the main circulating metabolite was 
SAR317981 at 9.4%. SAR318031 was detected in only one subject.  
The main metabolic pathway in all species is ethyl pyrrolidine oxidation. Minor pathways found in most 
investigated species are tri-aromatic group (TAG) oxidation and terbutyl oxidation. Two additional 
minor pathways found only in rats are glutathione conjugation and glucuronide conjugation.  
There are no unique human metabolites. The main circulating metabolite in humans SAR317981 (9.4% 
of radioactivity) was also formed in substantial amounts in rats (12-21%) and to a lesser extent in 
mice (5.2%). It is not found in quantifiable amounts in dog plasma. With its presence in substantial 
amounts in rats, this metabolite is however sufficiently investigated in non-clinical species. 
Excretion 
In mouse, rat and dog, the major part of fedratinib-related radioactivity was excreted via the faeces 
(78-95% of dose) and only a minor part was excreted through the urine (0.6-4.8% of dose). In bile-
duct cannulated rats, 51% of the dose was excreted via the bile following administration of [14C]-
fedratinib (after 48 h). Only a minor part of this represented the parent compound (2.3% excreted in 
bile 24 h after administration of fedratinib to bile-duct cannulated rats). In humans, the same pattern 
was observed (77% excreted in faeces and 5.2% in urine). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity was assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs at doses up to 1000 mg/kg 
and 300mg/kg fedratinib respectively. Bodyweight loss and diarrhoea was observed in rats treated 
with ≥400mg/kg, but mortality only occurred in one female rat treated with 400mg/kg. In dogs, 
diarrhoea, vomiting and decreased activity was observed in all animals treated with fedratinib ≥
100mg/kg.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs given 
fedratinib for up to 1 month, 6 months and 9 months respectively. Exposure levels  to fedratinib were 
low for rats (6 months, up to 30 mg/kg/day, margin-of-exposure (MOE): 0.106-0.153), dogs (9 
months, up to 15 mg/kg/day, MOE: 0.099-0.132) and slightly higher in mice (1 month, up to 400/300 
mg/kg/day, MOE: 0.9-1.2; 200 mg/kg/day, MOE: 2.3-3.4). It is apparent that exposures are much 
lower in animals than in humans, and therefore the human appears to tolerate fedratinib significantly 
better than toxicity animal species despite much higher systemic exposures.  
In mice, the main target organs of toxicity included: bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, kidney, stomach 
and urinary bladder. Bone marrow hypoplasia, thymus atrophy, non-glandular hyperplasia in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 33/170 
 
 
 
stomach and vacuolation of transitional cells in the urinary bladder was observed in mice treated with 
≥200 mg/kg/day (MOE: 2.3-3.4) fedratinib. All mice treated with 400/300 mg/kg/day (MOE:0.9-1.2) 
were euthanised prematurely in moribund condition. In addition to the above-mentioned observations, 
these mice displayed lymphocyte depletion and/or necrosis in the spleen, GALT and mesenteric lymph 
nodes, renal tubule degeneration and necrosis in the kidney, non-glandular ulceration/inflammation 
and glandular hypertrophy in the stomach. 
In rats, the main target organs of toxicity included the bone marrow and liver. Effects were also 
observed in the lymphoid tissues, lungs and heart. Rats treated with ≥30 mg/kg/day (1 month, MOE: 
0.06-0.1; 6 months, MOE: 0.106-0.153) showed decreased weight gain, bone marrow hypoplasia and 
lymphoid atrophy in the thymus, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, histiocytic infiltrates 
were observed in the lungs and mesenteric lymph nodes. Rats treated with 80 mg/kg/day (1 month, 
MOE: 0.2-0.4) additionally showed liver bile duct hypertrophy and/or necrosis/fibrosis, accompanied by 
increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) values. In these rats, myocardial degeneration and necrosis of the heart was also observed. 
In dogs, the main target organs of toxicity included the bone marrow and liver. Effects were also noted 
in lymphoid tissues and testis. Lymphocyte depletion was observed in the thymus, spleen, lymph 
nodes in dogs, increasing in severity in a dose-dependent fashion. In dogs treated with ≥10 
mg/kg/day (1 month, MOE: 0.1), bone marrow hypoplasia and bile duct hypertrophy and proliferation 
in the liver was noted. In 20/15 mg/kg/day (9 months, MOE: 0.1) and 40/30 mg/kg/day (1 month, 
MOE: 0.2-1.0) the bone marrow hypoplasia was accompanied by increased myeloid progenitor cells 
(MPCs) consistent with ineffective myelopoiesis. Infiltrates of myeloid progenitor cells were also noted 
in the spleen and liver in the 9-month study; this increase in myeloid progenitor cells was considered 
to represent an attempt at bone marrow/haematologic recovery. More exaggerated liver effects were 
observed in moribund animals. These effects included bile duct epithelial degeneration/regeneration 
and necrosis (sometimes with fibrosis and inflammation); hepatocellular necrosis; Kupffer cell 
hyperplasia; cholestasis, and arterial mural necrosis, accompanied by increases in ALT, AST, ALP and 
bilirubin levels. Other findings in moribund animals in the 9-month study included internal bleeding 
related to ulcers, chronic-active inflammation of the oesophagus and stomach. Pneumonia and/or 
abscesses were also observed at lethal dosages in both studies, possibly secondary to effects on the 
immune system associated with the changes in the bone marrow and lymphoid organs.  
In conclusion, fedratinib-related effects on the bone marrow (hypoplasia) and lymphoid tissues 
(lymphocyte depletion in the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes) in all three species are likely symptoms 
of exaggerated pharmacology and indicate clear immunosuppressive properties of fedratinib (also see 
immunotoxicity section). In addition, liver toxicity was observed in both rats and dogs, which is also 
relevant for humans, where increased ALT and AST levels have been observed. Liver toxicity is 
mentioned as an important potential risk in the RMP. Another target organ effected in all three species 
is the stomach. Clinical relevance is apparent, since in humans nausea and vomiting are common 
adverse effects. Effects on heart were seen in rats and mice (cardiomyopathy in rats and increased 
weight in mice), but not in dogs. As discussed in the section on safety pharmacology, heart is not likely 
to be a target organ in humans, since a clinical QT study revealed no effects. In mice, renal tubule 
degeneration and necrosis was observed in the kidney, but no other kidney findings were observed in 
other non-clinical species. In humans however, increased creatinine levels were noted. Other target 
organs identified in the repeat-dose toxicity studies are likely not clinically relevant since they were 
only observed in one single species. These include effects on urinary bladder, vagina, muscle and 
lungs. Effects on testes were seen in dogs (epidiymides/testis aspermia) and rats (seminal vesicles 
weight reduction).

Genotoxicity 
Fedratinib was negative in the Ames assay in bacterial cells, in vitro chromosomal assay in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Fedratinib has no genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic Tg.RasH2 mice, there were no neoplasms that were 
attributed to treatment with fedratinib. No 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats was performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fedratinib produced no effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats at 
dosages up to 30 mg/kg/day (MOE: 0.100-0.132). However, testes effects related to possible effects 
on sperm quality/quantity were seen in the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats (seminal vesicles 
weight reduction) at dosages of 80 mg/kg/day (1 month, MOE: 0.2) and dogs (epidiymides/testis 
aspermia) at dosages of 40/30 mg/kg/day (1 month, MOE: 0.5). 
Fedratinib produced evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity in the rat including increased post implantation 
loss, lower foetal body weights, and skeletal effects (additional ossification centres on the cervical 
vertebral neural arches) at dosages of 30 mg/kg/day (MOE: 0.112). Fedratinib produced no evidence 
of embryo-foetal toxicity in the rabbit at very low dosages up to 30 mg/kg/day (MOE: 0.080). 
In a rat pre- and post-natal development study, treatment with fedratinib resulted in decreased 
maternal body weight gain and F1 generation pup body weight and food consumption at dosage levels 
of 30 mg/kg/day (MOE: 0.132). There was no effect on any developmental landmark or behavioural 
assessments. F1 mating, fecundity and fertility indices and GD13 caesarean section parameters were 
unaffected.  
Toxicokinetic data 
In TK, low exposure levels were obtained in mice, rats and dogs following repeated administration, 
resulting in no safety margin. The exposure increased more than dose-proportionally in mice from 3 to 
30 mg/kg/day. This was less clear from 100 to 200 mg/kg/day: AUC increased more than dose-
proportionally in female mice, but this was not the case in males and also not for Cmax. In rats, 
exposure increased more than dose-proportionally up to 30 mg/kg/day. This was less clear from 30 to 
80 mg/kg/day. Exposure in dogs increased more than dose-proportionally. In rats and mice, the 
exposure was slightly higher in females than in males, approximately 2-fold at maximum. In dogs, no 
clear gender difference was visible. No accumulation was observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study. 
In rats and dogs, slight accumulation was observed, but no more than 2-fold. No measurable 
concentrations were found in control samples.  
Exposure was very low in the embryo-foetal development studies. The exposure multiple based on 
AUC0-24 was at most 0.1 in pregnant rats and at most 0.08 in pregnant rabbits. In pregnant rats, the 
exposure was somewhat lower than in non-pregnant female rats. Like in non-pregnant rats, the 
exposure increased more than dose-proportionally in pregnant rats. Also, in pregnant rabbits the 
exposure increased more than dose-proportionally.

Local Tolerance  
No specific studies have been conducted. 
Other toxicity studies 
Fedratinib demonstrated no phototoxic potential in vitro in 3T3 cells. 
The impurity SM3 showed an in-silico alert for mutagenicity. Several non-GLP micronucleus assays in 
mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells resulted in equivocal results, but SM3 was negative in a GLP Ames test 
and chromosomal aberrations test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Therefore, SM3 is not 
considered genotoxic. Two genotoxic impurities were identified: 1) isopropyl chloride, a potential 
synthesis byproduct; and 2) 1-(2-chloroethyl) pyrrolidine hydrochloride, a precursor of starting 
material SAR311801A. Both are below the threshold of toxicological concern for all drug substance 
batches representative of the commercial process and used in clinical trials. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
PBT screening: The octanol-water partitioning coefficient was determined according to OECD 107 at 
three pH values, resulting in log Dow values of -0.3, 2.1 and >3.1 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively. The 
Dow value at pH 7 is below the trigger values for performance of a bioaccumulation study (log Kow >3) 
or PBT assessment (log Kow >4.5).  
Phase I calculations result in a PECsw of 2.0 µg/L, which exceeds the trigger value for Phase II. Phase 
II calculations were not provided as part of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The proof of concept for efficacy of fedratinib was shown through in vitro and in vivo experiments. 
Fedratinib appears to have high specificity for mutant JAK2 and FLT3. Although fedratinib showed 
lower selectivity against JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2 the IC50 values for these recombinant kinases in two 
commercial kinase screens were still within clinically relevant concentrations (free Cmax in plasma of MF 
patients = 304 nM). Although in enzyme kinetic assays the IC50 values for other JAK family members 
JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2 are below the clinical Cmax of 304 nM which marks them as potential targets of 
fedratinib, when further evaluation on inhibitory potential was performed in a cell-based assay, no 
IC50 was reached for JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2, when tested up to 1 µM. This indicates that although 
binding is possible, there is no downstream consequence on inhibition of cell proliferation through 
these kinases. Therefore, within the JAK family of kinases, it can be concluded that fedratinib is specific 
for JAK2. The data concerning wild-type JAK2 is conflicting. While enzyme kinetics and a single cell-
based assay show high affinity binding and reduced proliferation, a xenograft mouse model showed no 
reduction of engraftment of wild-type JAK2. However, a contribution of wild-type JAK2 to the effect of 
fedratinib cannot be excluded.  
For other kinases outside the JAK family and FLT3, only enzyme kinetics data is available. These data 
indicate that binding of fedratinib to several kinases, including but not limited to ZIPK, FGFR1 V561M, 
and NUAK, is possible at clinically relevant concentrations. There is however no data in cell-based 
assays, and it is therefore not known if binding also leads to relevant inhibition of cell proliferation. In 
the context of the intended indication, effects through inhibition of other kinases besides JAK2 and 
FLT3 will likely not contribute to the overall effect. However, secondary effects through inhibition of 
other kinases cannot be excluded and could be related to some of the adverse effects seen in animals 
and humans. Since the safety profile of fedratinib is known, no further studies regarding the 
contribution of inhibition of other kinases is considered necessary. 
While other off-target binding appears to be possible for CNS related receptors, since adenosine, 
muscarinic, serotonin, sigma, and Na+ channel receptors and norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin

transporters were inhibited with more than 50% at 1 µM, the weight of evidence suggests that these 
interactions are not important in vivo. 
Numerous in vivo mouse models were used to evaluate the efficacy of fedratinib. Although proof of 
concept is shown in these studies, it appears that in mice a higher exposure to fedratinib than the 
exposure reached in humans is required to result in an effect on tumour cells. Additionally, in the 
xenograft mouse model, no toxicity was observed which raises doubts about exposure. However, the 
systemic exposure may have been lower in the xenograft model mice due to accumulation of fedratinib 
in tumour tissue relative to plasma (tumour/plasma ratio 1.65 to 25.2). The true efficacy potential is 
determined on a clinical level (please see clinical section below). 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted with doses that resulted in exposures far below the 
clinical exposure at the MRHD, and they are therefore not very informative. However, for aspects of 
the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and respiratory system sufficient data is available 
from repeated dose toxicity studies with higher doses and from clinical trial data, to conclude that 
there are no effects anticipated on these major organs systems. 
The pharmacokinetics of fedratinib were investigated adequately.  
The high melanin binding and the relatively long persistence of fedratinib in the eye were not 
associated with toxicity in mice and Beagle dog studies of up to 1 and 9 months duration and are 
therefore not considered a safety issue. Moreover, fedratinib demonstrated no phototoxic potential in 
vitro in 3T3 cells. 
There appears to be a large discrepancy between sensitivity to fedratinib in animals and humans, 
illustrated by the low exposure margins across the studies. However, because clinically relevant 
exposures cannot be attained in the toxicity species, the general lack of utility of these studies in 
producing clinically relevant safety data on fedratinib is acknowledged. The existing clinical data of 
fedratinib can be considered to supersede the (lack of) nonclinical toxicity data.  
Fedratinib is not genotoxic in the performed studies. It should be noted however, that the exposure in 
the in vivo rat micronucleus study was low (animal/human exposure ratios based on Cmax (ng/mL) and 
AUC0-24h (ng*h/mL) values were in range of 0.008 to 0.306 and 0.004 to 0.259). No long-term 
carcinogenicity study has been conducted, and this was justified by the applicant by referring to ICH 
guideline S9 (treatment of advanced cancer). However, this is not applicable to fedratinib and instead 
ICH S1 applies. According to ICH S1A/S1B carcinogenicity studies should be performed for any 
pharmaceutical whose expected clinical use is continuous for at least 6 months and in long-term 
carcinogenicity study in a second rodent species the rat is normally a species of choice. The applicant 
justified to the lack of value of rodent carcinogenicity studies, due to the low tolerability of rodents to 
fedratinib, resulting in low exposures in the studies. This is agreed, and therefore carcinogenicity 
studies can be waived. During the assessment the applicant submitted a weight of evidence approach 
to assess the carcinogenic potential of fedratinib. From the non-clinical evidence, the only concern is a 
prominent immunosuppressive effect of fedratinib, which is a known risk factor for tumorigenesis in 
humans. Secondary malignancies will be monitored in patients in an ongoing clinical study and in the 
postmarketing setting (please see clinical section below).  
Although no teratogenic effects were observed in rat or rabbit embryo-foetal toxicity studies, the 
exposure to fedratinib in these studies was well below the clinical exposure. The relevance of these 
studies for human safety is therefore limited. Based on the role of JAK2 in development described in 
literature, and the known class effects of other marketed JAK inhibitors, concern for exposure to 
fedratinib during pregnancy has been established. Due to this class effect and since other JAK 
inhibitors have a contraindication for pregnancy, a contraindication for pregnancy has been included in 
section 4.3 of the SmPC of Inrebic.

Regarding Ecotoxicity and environmental risk assessment the applicant is currently performing the 
Phase II testing. An updated ERA/PBT assessment will be provided by the end of 4Q2021. It is 
therefore not yet possible to conclude on the risk of Inrebic to the environment. However, considering 
that the data will be available soon, this is considered acceptable for this orphan medicine.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Marketing authorisation for Inrebic could be approvable from a non-clinical point of view. From the 
non-clinical evidence, the only concern is a prominent immunosuppressive effect of fedratinib, which is 
a known risk factor for tumorigenesis in humans. Secondary malignancies will be monitored in patients 
in an ongoing clinical study and in the post-marketing setting (please see clinical section below).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues:  
For the completion of the Environmental Risk Assessment, the applicant commits to performing a 
bioconcentration study in fish according to OECD 305. Further, the applicant is currently performing 
the Phase II testing. An updated ERA/PBT assessment is due by the end of Q4 2021. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
On 15 Nov 2013, the fedratinib US investigational new drug (IND) was placed on clinical hold by United 
States Food and Drug administration (FDA) after Sanofi provided cases of heart failure and preliminary 
case reports of Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) that occurred in subjects being treated with 
fedratinib. On 18 Nov 2013, Sanofi (previous sponsor) decided to terminate the fedratinib clinical 
development programme. Seven clinical studies including the pivotal studies EFC12153 and ARD12181 
did not run to completion with various impact on study results (additional studies ongoing at time of 
clinical hold: TES13519, a QT interval (QT) study; Study TED12015, the long-term extension study to 
TED12037; Study ARD11936, a phase 2 dose-range finding study; Study ARD12888, a phase 2 study 
in Japan in MF subjects; Study ARD12042, a phase 2 study in subjects with PV or ET who were 
resistant or intolerant to HU). Overall, long-term follow-up is limited.  
On 18 Aug 2017, FDA removed the clinical hold after a detailed review of all data regarding possible 
cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy and cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy was provided, including 
evaluation of thiamine levels in subjects on fedratinib therapy.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fedratinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of wild type and mutationally activated Janus kinase 2 
(JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine (FLT) kinase 3 (FLT3). Fedratinib is formulated as a 100 mg immediate 
release capsule. The recommended dose of Inrebic is 400 mg once daily for patients with a baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 40/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platelet count of ≥50 x 109/L. Fedratinib has not been studied in patients with a baseline platelet count 
<50 x 109/L. 
Inrebic may be taken with or without food. According to the applicant, administration with a high fat 
meal may reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting; therefore, it is recommended to be taken with 
food. 
Fedratinib is a weak base, with 2 pKa values of 6.3 and 9.5. It exhibits pH-dependent solubility and 
permeability in vitro. It is freely soluble under acidic conditions (>100 mg/mL at pH 1) and practically 
insoluble in the neutral condition (4 μg/mL at pH 7.4). Fedratinib is not a stereoisomer, so 
interconversion is not an issue. 
Bioanalysis. In general, fedratinib plasma concentrations in clinical studies were determined with liquid 
chromatography methods, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analytical methods 
for fedratinib appear validated to a reasonable extent, with accuracy, specificity and stability meeting 
appropriate requirements.  
Models. A population pharmacokinetic model FEDR-MPK-001 was fitted to time-concentration data 
from six studies (one Phase 1 study: TED12037, four Phase 2 studies: ARD11936, ARD12042, 
ARD12181, ARD12888 and one Phase 3 study: EFC12153), all of which were patient studies. The 
developed model features first-order absorption and elimination, absorption lagtime and two-
compartment distribution. The popPK model has been validated to a reasonable extent.  
Further, a PBPK model was developed in Study FEDR-DMPK-2852, with the purpose to predict drug-
drug interactions between fedratinib (victim) and cytochrome P450 modulators, drug-drug interactions 
between fedratinib (perpetrator) and cytochrome P450 substrates, and drug-drug interactions between 
fedratinib (perpetrator) and transporter substrates. The developed PBPK models were validated against 
the clinical observation including 1) PK data following repeated doses of fedratinib in patients with 
myelofibrosis (MF), 2) drug-drug interaction data between fedratinib (as the victim) and ketoconazole 
in healthy subjects, and 3) drug-drug interaction data between fedratinib (as the perpetrator) and 
cocktail probe substrates consisting of midazolam, omeprazole, and metoprolol in patients with 
refractory solid tumours. Based on the standard PBPK model, the applicant developed a ‘low QGut’ 
PBPK model at 300 mg, in which the gut blood flow parameter (QGut) was reduced from the default 
6.5 L/h to 1.34 L/h. This model was validated against the situation of a single dose of fedratinib 
(victim) with and without ketoconazole. Results demonstrate reasonable performance of the model in 
both situations. Therefore, the PBPK model is considered sufficiently validated for prediction of effects 
on 300 mg single dose fedratinib PK of mild to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

pharmacodynamics of fedratinib 
b Study TED12015 was an open-label extension of Study TED12037. 
Absorption  
In healthy subjects, fedratinib was absorbed rapidly with a median tmax ranging from 0.5 to 4 hours 
following single oral doses of 10 to 680 mg. Likewise, after single oral administration of a 400 mg dose 
to MF patients, fedratinib was absorbed rapidly, with a Cmax of approximately 1430 ± 750 ng/ml 
reached after 1 to 4 hours.  
No absolute bioavailability study in human was conducted.

Clinical and commercial formulations. Three different types of capsule formulations (formulations 
initial, 1A1, and 1B1) have been used in all the clinical studies. No major differences exist between the 
three capsule formulations used in the clinical studies. The provided analysis FEDR-MPK-003 did not 
indicate major differences in PK obtained from the different capsule formulations under fasting 
conditions. Therefore, PK data obtained with the various capsules under fasting conditions are 
considered representative for the commercial formulation. 
Effect of food. Based on the results from Study FED12258, administration of the 100 mg fedratinib 
capsule with a high-fat breakfast resulted in a 14% and 13% decrease in fedratinib Cmax and AUClast, 
respectively, whereas, at 500 mg (5 x 100 mg capsules), administration of a high-fat breakfast 
resulted in a 14% and 26% increase in fedratinib Cmax and AUClasth, respectively. The tmax at the 100 
mg and 500 mg dose was somewhat delayed, i.e. from 1.5 to 2h, and from 2 to 4 h, respectively.  
Data from Study ALI13451 at a 500 mg dose in 19 healthy subjects are also used in support of the 
hypothesis that nausea and vomiting occur less frequently when given with food. Indeed, the most 
frequently reported gastrointestinal TEAEs such as nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the fed 
state (62.5% and 16.7%) than in the fasted state (87.5% and 66.7%), in subjects receiving a 500 mg 
fedratinib dose. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution of fedratinib at steady-state, measured as the sum of 
apparent central and peripheral volume of distribution in popPK Study FEDR-MPK-001, was 
approximately 1770 L in patients with myelofibrosis at a 400 mg QD dose. This large volume of 
distribution indicates extensive tissue distribution of fedratinib. Approximately 95% of fedratinib is 
bound to human plasma protein, mostly to α1-acid glycoprotein. In the mass-balance Study 
BEX12257, limited distribution of fedratinib and/or its metabolites into red blood cells (blood to plasma 
ratio of 0.615 to 0.753) was observed. 
Metabolism and Elimination 
In the mass-balance Study BEX12257, fedratinib was the predominant component (approximately 80% 
of plasma radioactivity) in systemic circulation after oral administration of fedratinib. None of the 
fedratinib metabolites contributed greater than 10% of total drug-related exposure in plasma. 
Metabolite M2 was the main circulating metabolite accounting for approximately 9% of the total 
radioactivity AUC. In vitro data indicate that fedratinib is metabolised by multiple CYPs, with the 
predominant contribution from CYP3A4 and with lesser contributions from CYP2C19 and flavin-
containing monooxygenases (FMOs).  
Both the parent compound and total radioactivity peaked at approximately 3 hours post-dose in 
plasma. Moreover, the kinetic profiles of the parent drug and its prominent metabolite M2 were similar 
from 3 to 12 hours, the last sampling time analysed, suggesting that M2 will not disproportionally 
accumulate.  
Since M2 was approximately 2-fold less active than the parent compound, fedratinib activity is 
determined mainly by fedratinib parent. When adjusted for reduced potency, metabolite M2 is 
estimated to contribute less than 5% to this activity. 
Fedratinib is mainly (approximately 77%) excreted via the faeces, and to a low extend (5%) via urine. 
Unchanged drug was the major component in excreta, accounting on average for approximately 23% 
and 3% of the dose in faeces and urine, respectively. In addition, in faeces, 19 fedratinib metabolites 
were detected, each accounting for 10% of the dose or lower.

The popPK estimated apparent Cl is 13 L/h for a typical MF patient with a median creatinine clearance 
of 78.3 mL/min. The fedratinib t1/2 estimated from popPK Study FEDR-MPK-001 is 114 h. The long 
terminal half-life indicates slower redistribution and subsequent elimination of fedratinib from 
peripheral tissue. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism. Fedratinib is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. 
Both enzymes are known to harbour potentially relevant functional polymorphic forms. In the provided 
PG investigations PMH0143 in healthy subjects and PMH0144 in MF patients, no relationship was 
observed between fedratinib AUC and Cmax in relation to CYP2C19 genotype. However, an apparent 
relationship was noted between CYP3A4 gene and fedratinib exposure. I.e., for one variant 
(CYP3A4_rs2740574 (CYP3A4*3)), fedratinib exposure appeared to be decreased, whereas for another 
variant (CYP3A4_rs2740574 (CYP3A4*1B)) fedratinib exposure appeared to be increased. These 
results should be considered with caution, due to the low numbers of subjects. For CYP2C19, it was 
also investigated if a relationship exists in this dataset between genotype-predicted metabolising 
phenotype (poor metaboliser (PM), intermediate metaboliser (IM), extensive metaboliser (EM), 
ultrarapid metaboliser (UM)) for CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, NAT1 and NAT2 genes and fedratinib Cmax 
and AUCinf. In both PG studies, no such relationship was apparent.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In healthy subjects, a more than dose-proportional increase in AUC and Cmax is observed between 
single doses of 10 to 680 mg. In MF patients, in the clinically relevant dose range of 100 mg or 
greater, and more specifically, the 300 mg to 500 mg dose range, PK following single and multiple 
doses was approximately dose proportional. 
Time-dependency. After repeated QD oral fedratinib doses in MF patients, steady state appeared to 
have been achieved by Cycle 1 Day 15, with approximately 2-3-fold accumulation of AUC0-24h and Cmax 
at the 400 mg QD dose level. Based on in vitro results, fedratinib administration results in 
autoinhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and autoinduction of CYP3A4, which may lead to time-
dependent changes in fedratinib PK.  
The total intersubject variability of PK parameters in PV and MF/ET patients is moderate to large, with 
a %CV of >50%. The total intrasubject variability of PK parameters in PV and MF/ET patients, based 
on PopPK appears moderate to large, with a %CV of approximately 30%. 
PK in the target population 
For patients included in the proposed indication (MF, post ET-MF and post PV-MF) no apparent 
differences in fedratinib exposure are apparent. PV patients have been observed to have 30% lower 
fedratinib exposure. Further, the applicant provided a comparison of the single dose AUCinf and Cmax in 
healthy subjects and the steady state AUCT and Cmax in patients. Fedratinib AUCT in patients appeared 
higher than AUCinf in healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function. In renal impairment Study POP13449, as compared to matched subjects with 
normal renal function, fedratinib Cmax and AUCinf increased by 1.4-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, in 
subjects with moderate renal impairment, and by 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, in subjects with 
severe renal impairment following a single 300 mg dose of fedratinib. Creatinine clearance was 
identified as a significant covariate on CL/F of fedratinib in the final PopPK model in Study FEDR-MPK-
Assessment report

Page 44/170 
 
 
 
001, and an effect or renal impairment on fedratinib exposure was observed: in MF patients with mild 
(60 ≤ CLcr < 90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ CLcr < 60 mL/min) had 10% and 37% 
increases in fedratinib plasma AUC exposure, respectively.  
Impaired hepatic function. After a 300 mg single dose administration in hepatic impairment study 
POP13450, fedratinib exposure (total and unbound Cmax and AUC) in the subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh total score from 5 to 6) was not appreciably different from those observed in 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function parameters like albumin, ALT, AST and NCI 
ODWG liver function classification were not significant covariates in the popPK analysis FEDR-MPK-001. 
No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of fedratinib was observed with regards to mild 
hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times 
ULN and any AST increase) or moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times 
ULN and any AST). Further, in patients receiving fedratinib, the frequencies and distributions of TEAEs 
were generally similar across baseline hepatic functions (normal hepatic function, n=126; 
mild/moderate impairment, n=66) in the pivotal study EFC12153.  
Gender, race, weight. In popPK analysis FEDR-MPK-001, gender and race were not a statistically 
significant covariates affecting fedratinib PK exposure. In the popPK model, weight was a significant 
covariate, affecting V2/F. The large volume of distribution of fedratinib suggests that fedratinib may be 
distributed by diffusion into the extracellular fluids, the volume of which increases with body weight; 
thus, the estimated increases in the central volume of distribution of fedratinib with increased body 
weight are consistent with the physiological effects of weight. Within the 40 to 135 kg weight range, 
the maximum change as compared to a typical patient of 70.1 kg, was less than 30%.  
Age. In the popPK model, age (20-95 years) was not a significant covariate affecting fedratinib PK 
exposure. The number of patients that was included per age category is indicated in the Table 11. A 
waiver for the conduct of paediatric studies was granted by EMA (EMA Decision P/0261/2012). No 
paediatric patients have therefore been included in the provided clinical studies.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on the in vitro data, fedratinib levels could potentially be increased when co-administered with 
drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A. Indeed, in the presence of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) 
in in vivo DDI Study INT12893, an approximately 3-fold increase in fedratinib exposure following a 
single 300 mg dose of fedratinib was noted.  
The results of the PBPK simulation Study FEDR-DMPK-2852 may indicate that, probably due to the long 
t1/2 of 114 h, the effect of strong inhibition of CYP3A4 is maintained relatively long after stopping the 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
Based on the results from the in vivo ketoconazole Study INT12893 and the PBPK Study FEDR-DMPK-
2852 simulations, agents that increase fedratinib plasma concentrations (i.e., strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors) need to be used with caution and the fedratinib dose needs to be initially reduced to 200 mg 
QD with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Further, the PBPK simulations indicate that DDI with mild and 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are less severe than observed with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 45/170 
 
 
 
 
Fedratinib is a substrate for P-gp, but not for BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OAT-, OATP-, OCT- and MATE-type 
transporters. The applicant concludes that no significant effects on fedratinib PK are expected upon 
inhibition of P-gp.  
In vivo DDI study FEDR-CP-002, investigating the effect of co-administration of the potent CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin and the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz on fedratinib exposure was provided 
during the procedure. The study was conducted in an appropriate manner, and showed that fedratinib 
exposures when co-administered with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin were 19.5% and 30.2%, for 
AUC∞ and Cmax, respectively, of that when administered alone. Further, fedratinib exposures when co-
administered with the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz were 53.2% and 71.5%, for AUC∞ and Cmax, 
respectively, of that when administered alone. 
Fedratinib is an inhibitor of multiple CYP isoforms (2D6, 2C8, 2C9 and 3A4), but with relatively high 
IC50 values ≥10 µM in vitro. With a free fedratinib Cmax of 0.16 µM, no in vivo interaction via these 
enzymes is to be expected. Further, fedratinib is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4, and also inhibits several transporters with IC50 values ≤ 10 µM in vitro. Considering the 
expected luminal fedratinib concentration of approximately 300 µM, it is expected that P-gp is 
saturated (in vitro at a concentration of 40 µM), and the effect of inhibition of P-glycoprotein on 
fedratinib exposure is expected to be small. Based on in vivo data from the cocktail DDI Study 
INT12497, concomitant administration of fedratinib with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam, the 
CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole, and the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol, increases midazolam, 
omeprazole, and metoprolol AUCinf by 3.8-, 2.8-, 1.8-fold respectively. Dose modifications of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 substrate drugs should be considered based on these results, with close 
monitoring of safety and efficacy.  
Fedratinib did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 (based on enzyme activity and gene expression). 
Fedratinib exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in CYP3A4 gene expression for all donors but 
did not induce CYP3A4 enzymatic activity. This net decrease in CYP3A4 enzymatic activity in the 
presence of an increase in CYP3A4 gene expression is likely the result of the observed time-dependent 
inhibitory effect of fedratinib on CYP3A4. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fedratinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with activity against wild type and mutationally activated Janus 
Associated Kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Fedratinib is a JAK2-selective 
inhibitor with higher potency for JAK2 over family members JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In patients, the pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of fedratinib were measured by inhibition of substrate 
(STAT3) phosphorylation in the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway (phase 2 study ARD11936), 
changes in the expression of circulating proteins (CPs) (phase 2 study ARD11936, phase 1 study 
TED12037/ TED12015), and by changes in JAK2V617F allele burden (phase 1 study TED12037/ 
TED12015, phase 2 study ARD11936, phase 3 study EFC12153). Fedratinib showed a time-dependent, 
but not dose-related inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in all treatment groups (300 mg, 400 mg, 
500 mg) at 2 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1.

Figure 5: Mean percent changes (%) in pSTAT3 relative to baseline in myelofibrosis patients 
receiving fedratinib – (ITT Population) (study ARD11936) 
Further, several immune/inflammatory cytokines were downregulated, including amongst IL-1, IL-6, 
and TNF-a. An effect (reduction) on JAK2V617F mutant allele burden was shown in the phase 1 study 
TED12037; in patients who completed at least 6 cycles of therapy and who had baseline allele burden 
values > 20% (range 23%-100%, n = 20), 45% had a ≥ 50% reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden in 
granulocytes at the end of Cycle 6 relative to the baseline. This was maintained during longer follow-up 
(up to cycle 48) in the extension part (study TED12015). However, an effect on allele burden was not 
shown in study ARD11936 and study EFC12153. The relationship of pSTAT3 and fedratinib plasma 
concentrations was described by an inhibitory Emax model (see table below) and is graphically shown 
in the Figure below.

There are no data on inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
Effect on corrected QT interval (QTc)  
The effect of fedratinib on ventricular repolarisation was studied in a phase 1 study in solid 
malignancies with patients receiving a 500 mg dose (study TES13519). A total of 59 subjects received 
placebo (5 capsules) on Day 1 and fedratinib 500 mg (5 ×100 mg capsules) QD for 14 days (Days 2 to 
15). There was no significant effect on QTc using Fridericia’s formule (QTcF) following fedratinib 
treatment in cancer subjects. The estimated largest time-matched mean difference (LTMMD) for the 
QTcF interval, observed at T4H, was 4.32 msec (90% CI: 1.16; 7.49). The upper bound of the 2-sided 
90% CI was lower than 10 msec. Supportive information was provided by a secondary analysis; the

mean difference estimate at tmax vs placebo was -2.54 msec (90% CI: -5.93, 0.84). No subjects had 
an increase in QTcF, QTcB or QTcN > 60 msec. There were no notable changes during fedratinib 
treatment in safety 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), rhythm and conduction analysis or vital signs. 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses of pSTAT3  
Overall, there was a clear trend observed for a fedratinib concentration dependent inhibition of pSTAT3 
levels in whole blood leukocytes, both in healthy subjects and MF patients. The estimated EC50 in the 
various studies are generally around 1000 ng/ml, a concentration that appears to be reached at 
fedratinib doses of 300 mg and higher (see also figure below).

Exposure-efficacy analyses 
With respect to exposure-efficacy relationships, significant relationships were established between the 
cumulative AUC from cycle 1 to cycle 6 (AUCC1-C6) and percent change in spleen volume at the end of 
cycle 6, spleen volume response rate (RR, percentage of patients with >35% reduction at the end of 
cycle 6), and total symptom score response (TSSR).

In general, the increase in effect on these efficacy parameters going from the 400 to the 500 mg dose 
is limited. This may be attributable to the dose reductions and dose interruptions, resulting in 
significantly overlapping cumulative AUCC1-C6 for the 400 mg and 500 mg dose cohorts. 
Exposure-safety analyses 
PK-PD analysis Study FEDR-MPK-002 was conducted using fedratinib PK exposures and safety data 
from Phase 3 Study EFC12153 and Phase 2 studies ARD11936, ARD12888, ARD12181, and ARD12042.

ER models were developed to characterize the relationships between fedratinib exposure and various 
safety endpoints in patients with MF, PV or ET. The PK exposure parameter of the fedratinib steady 
state AUC0-24,ss at the nominal starting dose was used for exposure-safety analysis since the safety 
endpoints were based on the worst values across all Cycles from Cycle 1 to Cycle 6. 
The safety endpoints analysed were:  
•  Anaemia of Grade 3 or above (worst across Cycles 1-6) 
• 
Thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or above (worst across Cycles 1-6) 
•  Nausea and vomiting of any grade (worst across Cycles 1-6) 
•  Diarrhoea of any grade (worst across Cycles 1-6) 
The PopPK model developed for fedratinib (Study FEDR-MPK-001) was used to estimate the steady 
state AUC0-24,ss. The log-transformed steady state AUC0-24,ss (logAUC0-24,ss) at the nominal starting dose 
was used as the predictor variable for safety endpoints in subsequent ER analyses. A total of 404 
subjects, who had both post-hoc estimated PK exposures (logAUC0-24,ss) from the final PopPK model 
and safety data, were included in the PK-safety relationship analysis. 
Anaemia of grade 3 or above 
The stepwise logistic model identified both fedratinib exposure and the baseline haemoglobin levels as 
the significant factors affecting the probability of anaemia of Grade 3 or above. Results are shown in

diarrhoea of any grade (p = 0.0039). An increasing trend between logAUC0-24,ss and probability of 
diarrhoea of any grade analysis was observed, however the statistical tests indicated a lack of fit.

Grade 3 and above thrombocytopenia 
The stepwise logistic model identified both fedratinib exposure and the baseline platelet count as the 
significant factors affecting the probability of thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or above. There was a 
marginal effect of the fedratinib PK exposure on the probability of thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or 
above (p = 0.03). An increasing trend between logAUC0-24,ss and probability of thrombocytopenia of 
Grade 3 or above was apparent. However, the baseline platelet count was a statistically significant 
covariate affecting probability of thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or above (p < 0.0001) suggesting that

the baseline disease characteristic of platelet count had outweighed fedratinib exposure to increase 
probable incidents of thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or above. Results are shown in figure and table 
below: 
logAUC0-24,ss = log-transformed area under the curve from Time 0 to 24 hours post dose at steady state. 
The red line is the model predicted probability and the two gray lines are the 95% confidence bands from logistic regression. The six

Table 20: Predicted odds ratio from logistic regression of thrombocytopenia of grade 3 or 
above (Study FEDR-MPK-002) 
With respect to exposure-safety relationships, increasing fedratinib exposure at steady-state (AUC0-
24,ss) appeared to be related with increased anaemia Grade 3 or above, thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 
or above, diarrhoea of any grade, and nausea and vomiting of any grade. However, the baseline 
haemoglobin level (≤ 10g/dl vs >10 g/dl) and the baseline platelet count (< 100 x 109 vs ≥ 100 x 
109/l) appeared to be more important for the occurrence of anaemia or thrombocytopenia than 
fedratinib exposure. 
Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) 
Seven patients with potential Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) were identified out of 608 patients 
treated with multiple doses of fedratinib in the clinical programme. These potential cases occurred at 
the 500 mg QD dose level.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses on ECG 
Based on a linear mixed-effect model applied to exposure and QTc data from Phase 3 Study EFC12153, 
there was a weak relationship between the difference from placebo in mean change of QTcF from 
baseline and fedratinib concentration, with an estimated slope of 0.002 msec/(ng/mL) (95% CI: 
[0.001, 0.004]). The predicted mean effect for the placebo corrected change from baseline in QTcF at 
the geometric mean Cmax at steady state with the 400 mg and 500 mg repeated doses (1804 ng/mL 
and 2294 ng/mL, respectively) were 4.6 msec (90% CI: [2.4, 6.8]) and 5.7 msec (90% CI: [3.3, 
8.2]), respectively (Study EFC12153). This result is considered supportive for the findings in the 
dedicated QTc Study TES13519, where no clinically meaningful QTcF prolongation induced by fedratinib 
up to 500 mg/day was noted. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis. According to the applicant, the validation of the method(s) and sample analysis were 
conducted in compliance with the appropriate FDA and EMA regulations in place at the time studies 
were conducted.  
Models. The main outcomes of the pop-PK model are to simulate fedratinib exposures for the 
exposure-response analysis, and to investigate covariates, the outcome of which affects the SmPC text 
on special populations. The initial population PK model presented by the applicant did not investigate 
dose affecting F instead of V2/F, and fedratinib PK time-dependency, although both autoinduction and 
autoinhibition are present. In order to evaluate a model with dose as a covariate of bioavailability (F) 
instead of apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F), additional data obtained with such a modified 
model were provided. AUCs predicted with the original and modified model appeared similar, arguing 
against a major dose-dependency of the AUC. 
Further, no healthy subject PK data were included in the popPK model in Study FEDR-MPK-001. Since 
exposure in healthy subjects is stated to be lower than in patients and drug-drug interactions may 
therefore be quantitatively different in healthy subjects and patients, it was requested to optimise the 
popPK model by including such healthy subject PK data. However, the applicant rightfully argued that 
instead of via popPK methodology, DDI data from healthy subjects may be translated to patients via 
PBPK methods.  
The ‘low QGut’ PBPK model FEDR-DMPK-2852 at 300 mg was validated against the situation of a single 
dose of fedratinib (victim) with and without ketoconazole in healthy subjects. Results demonstrate 
reasonable performance of the model in both situations. Therefore, the PBPK model is considered 
sufficiently validated for prediction of effects on 300 mg fedratinib PK of mild to strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors. Further simulations were however conducted using a 400 mg dose using the standard 
baseline PBPK model. The applicant provided a comparison of the DDI predictions using the low QGut 
and the standard PBPK model. Based on this comparison, it can be concluded that the PBPK based DDI 
predictions for fedratinib either as victim or perpetrator for the two PBPK models are similar. 
The PBPK model is considered not sufficiently validated for prediction of the effects of CYP3A4 
inducers, since this is a situation outside the validated range of DDI, and quantitative predictions by 
this model regarding the effect of such inducers were therefore not included in the SmPC. 
PBPK models for midazolam, omeprazole and metoprolol, as substrate/victim for effects of fedratinib 
(perpetrator), were validated to a limited extend. Since these models have only been used to mimic 
the data in the in vivo cocktail DDI Study INT12497, and no predictions were made based on these 
models, these will not be further discussed. No data were provided on the method development for 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 56/170 
 
 
 
prediction of the effects of inhibition of transporters on fedratinib PK. Therefore, any simulations in this 
respect are only considered exploratory.  
In the exposure-response analysis report, the applicant claims less than dose-dependent cumulative 
AUC due to dose reduction/interruption, especially at a 500 mg dose. However, the proposed posology 
(400 mg QD starting dose, downwards titration allowed until 200 mg QD) is not complicated by the 
uncertainty in dose proportionality. Furthermore, the dose of 500 mg dose, for which the dose 
proportionality was mainly questioned, is not currently not applied for. 
Absorption. The absolute oral bioavailability of fedratinib in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys ranged 
between 18% and 37%. No absolute bioavailability study in human was conducted. The applicant 
states that, since following oral administration of fedratinib to human subjects, 23% of the dose is 
recovered in faeces as unchanged drug, the absorption is at least 77%. A somewhat lower degree of 
fedratinib systemic absorption than 77% cannot fully be excluded. However, since PBPK-based DDI 
predictions in PBPK Study Fedratinib-DMPK-2852 have been conducted assuming a somewhat lower 
absorption of fedratinib, i.e., 65%, this issue is not pursued further. 
Based on indirect comparison of the exposure following administration of 300 or 500 mg fedratinib as 
capsule and the 200 mg as solution, no major differences in bioavailability between the capsule and 
the oral solution used in the mass balance Study Bex12257, were observed. 
Effect of food. Food-effect Study FED12258, using the 100 mg fedratinib capsules at a final dose of 100 
mg and 500 mg was conducted with formulation 1A1 and not with the final formulation 1B1/1C1. 
Additional information on a food-effect was obtained in Study AL13451, using the 100 mg capsule 
formulation 1B1. The outcome of this Study ALI13415 is in line with food-interaction data obtained 
with formulation 1A1 in Study FED12258 and considering the minor differences between formulation 
1B1 and commercial formulation 1C1, the food-interaction data obtained in Study ALI13451 are 
considered valid for the commercial 1C1 formulation as well. 
Further, data obtained with the 100 mg capsule formulation in Study ALI13451 under fasting and fed 
conditions are supportive for the hypothesis that nausea and vomiting occur less frequently when given 
with food. Overall, the occurrence to the TEAEs nausea and vomiting, especially at higher fedratinib 
doses under fasting conditions, is acknowledged. Further, although the data indicating less nausea and 
vomiting under fed conditions are obtained from a limited number of subjects in Study ALI13451, the 
advice to take fedratinib with food for reasons of tolerance, is accepted. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism. Although potential effects of genetic polymorphisms 
of metabolising enzymes and drug transporters was investigated both in healthy subjects and MF 
patients, a drawback of the provided PG data regarding CYP3A4 is that the relative enzymatic activity 
of CYP3A4*1B and *3 is not known (ref https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP3A4), and that data have 
not been analysed for known functional polymorphisms of CYP3A4, i.e., polymorphisms leading to an 
increased or decreased CYP3A4 activity. The effect of other CYP3A4 variants will be evaluated in Study 
FEDR-MF-002. Considering the current knowledge from scientific literature on the effect of CYP3A4*22 
heterozygous mutation (which is by far the most common encountered situation), resulting in an effect 
that is comparable to that of a mild to moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, at this stage it is acceptable to 
assume that the effect of CYP3A4*22 on fedratinib exposure is not clinically relevant in such patients. 
In this respect, the information provided on the clinical relevance of the effect of mild and moderate 
inhibitors of 3A4 on fedratinib exposure is supportive. 
Time-dependency The mean accumulation ratios are similar in adult patients with primary MF, post-PV 
MF or post-ET MF, ranging from 3- to 4-fold. Of note, 30% lower exposures (increased clearance) were 
observed in PV patients (being different from post-PV MF patients as in the indication) as compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 57/170 
 
 
 
primary MF, post-PV MF or post-ET MF patients. In healthy subjects, exposure and accumulation was 
even lower (increased clearance) than in PV patients. 
PK in the target population. Fedratinib AUCT in patients appeared higher than AUCinf in healthy 
subjects. DDIs in patients was predicted using exposure data in healthy subjects. By doing so, DDIs 
related to effects of other medicines on fedratinib (victim) exposure are considered to be estimated in 
a conservative manner by using exposure data in healthy subjects. In the healthy subject in vivo DDI 
studies investigating fedratinib as perpetrator, the fedratinib doses applied were higher than the 400 
mg dose advised in MF patients, i.e., 500 mg or 600 mg. This resulted in fedratinib steady-state 
exposures comparable to higher than those obtained in patients. Therefore, the outcome of these 
healthy subject DDI studies are considered applicable for patients as well. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function. According to the mass balance Study BEX12257, total radioactivity excreted in 
urine was 5 % of the dose. However, unexpectedly increase of fedratinib AUC∞ was 1.9 fold in 
subjects with severe renal impairment and 1.5 fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. Exposure was also increased in subjects with mild 
renal impairment. This increased exposure may be due to increase in alpha1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) 
levels and resulting reduced unbound fraction in patients with renal impairment.  
The applicant argues that the 1.5-fold increased fedratinib exposure in patients with moderate renal 
impairment is not clinically relevant, based on comparable frequencies and distributions of TEAEs in the 
pivotal Phase 3 trial EFC12153 (no of patients with normal renal function, n=57; mild/moderate 
impairment, n=128). This is agreed. However, in the absence of reassuring safety data for patients 
with severe renal impairment, a 2-fold dose-reduction is proposed for such patients which is 
acceptable. 
Impaired hepatic function. After a 300 mg single dose administration in hepatic impairment study 
POP13450, fedratinib exposure (total and unbound Cmax and AUC) in the subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh total score from 5 to 6) was not appreciably different from those observed in 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function parameters like albumin, ALT, AST and NCI 
ODWG liver function classification were not significant covariates in the popPK analysis FEDR-MPK-001. 
No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of fedratinib was observed with regard to mild 
hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times 
ULN and any AST increase) or moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times 
ULN and any AST). Further, in patients receiving fedratinib, the frequencies and distributions of TEAEs 
were generally similar across baseline hepatic functions (normal hepatic function, n=126; 
mild/moderate impairment, n=66) in the pivotal study EFC12153. Based on lack of significant 
differences in fedratinib PK in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, as well a safety 
data from Phase 3 Study EFC12153, no dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild 
or moderate hepatic impairment. The limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment has been addressed in the SmPC. In addition, the following warning has been added in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC: “ Patients should have their hepatic function monitored at baseline, at least 
monthly for the first 3 months, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. After observed 
toxicity, patients should be monitored at least every 2 weeks until resolution. ALT and AST elevations 
were generally reversible with dose modifications or permanent treatment discontinuation (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.8)”. At this stage the effect of severe hepatic impairment on fedratinib PK is not 
clear and a relevant effect cannot be ruled out since the predominant clearance pathway of fedratinib 
appears to be via hepatic metabolism. The proposal of the applicant that fedratinib should not be used 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment until data are available in these patients is supported. The 
results of the currently ongoing study in patients with severe hepatic impairment is awaited.

Gender, race, weight. The number of males (249) and females (203) included in the popPK analysis 
FEDR-MPK-001 has been indicated in the SmPC section 5.2. Likewise, the number of patients with 
White (399), Black (7), Asian (44) and Other (2) background included in this popPK analysis has been 
indicated in the SmPC section 5.2. In the popPK model, the estimated maximum increases in the 
central volume of distribution of fedratinib with increased body weight within the 40 to 135 kg weight 
range, as compared to a typical patient of 70.1 kg, was less than 30%. Information on the weight of 
patients included in the clinical studies, with information that no PK data is available for patients 
weighing more than 135 kg is provided in the SmPC.  
Age. In the popPK model, age (20-95 years) was not a significant covariate affecting fedratinib PK 
exposure. The number of patients that was included per age category is indicated in the SmPC section 
5.2. 
Interactions 
Effect other drugs on fedratinib PK. In the presence of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole in in 
vivo DDI Study INT12893, an approximately 3-fold increase in fedratinib exposure following a single 
300 mg dose of fedratinib was noted. Based on this in vivo DDI study and PBPK results, strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors need to be used with caution and the fedratinib dose needs to be initially reduced to 200 mg 
QD with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In cases where co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
discontinued, fedratinib dosage should be increased to 300 mg QD during the first 2 weeks after 
discontinuation of the CYP3A4 inhibitor, and then to 400 mg QD thereafter as tolerated. Subsequently, 
additional dose modifications should be made with monitoring of fedratinib related safety and efficacy. 
If AEs are still not resolved after reducing fedratinib dose, dose interruption of either fedratinib or 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or alternative therapies that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 activity should be 
considered based on overall benefit/risk for the patient. The proposed dose advice in relation to 
concomitantly administered strong CYP3A4 is supported and described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In 
case of combination of fedratinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, next to dose reduction, a 
recommendation for more frequent monitoring of haematological parameters and of clinical signs and 
symptoms of fedratinib-related adverse drug reactions (at least weekly) is indicated in the SmPC.  
Results of PBPK simulations indicate that the effect of strong inhibition of CYP3A4 is maintained 
relatively long after stopping the co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. In comparison with a  
‘reference’ PBPK simulation, using the situation where the fedratinib dose is increased to 400 mg 
immediately after stopping the co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the proposed stepwise 
increase after stopping the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor co-administration (first 2 weeks 300mg OD, then 
400 mg fedratinib) yields less increased fedratinib exposure than in case the original 400 mg fedratinib 
dose is used immediately after stopping the CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
The PBPK simulations further indicate that DDI with mild and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are less 
severe than observed with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and the applicant considers no dose-
modification appears necessary. Based on efficacy and safety data obtained with a 400 and 500 mg 
fedratinib, with the 400 mg dose being better tolerated, the applicant proposed an upper limit of the 
therapeutic margin of fedratinib of 1.25, which is agreed. Therefore, the 20% increased fedratinib 
exposure obtained following short term inhibition by a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is not considered 
clinically relevant. A safety consideration upon prolonged moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 is included in 
the SmPC. Since no quantitative dose advice is given for moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, this part of 
the paragraph is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
An in vivo DDI with the dual CYP2C19/3A4 inhibitor fluconazole or upon simultaneous inhibition of 
CYP3A4 and 2C19 by separate inhibitors cannot be excluded based on the in vitro data. Indeed, an 
interaction was predicted based on a PBPK Study, however, the PBPK model was not validated for 
CYP2C19. The applicant stated that these potential interactions will be further investigated in dedicated 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 59/170 
 
 
 
DDI studies. The submission of these studies is awaited. It is agreed that until data from this DDI 
study are received, dual CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors like fluconazole and fluvoxamine should be 
avoided in patients receiving fedratinib. At this stage this is indicated both in in section 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC. It should however be indicated that not only combined inhibition of CYP2C19 and 3A4 by a 
single agent is of concern, but also the combination with a single inhibitor of CYP2C19 and a single 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 at the same time. 
The in vitro predicted DDI with the strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (rifampicin and efavirenz, 
respectively) were further investigated in a dedicated in vivo DDI study. In vivo DDI study FEDR-CP-
002, investigating the effect of co-administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin and the 
moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz on fedratinib exposure which was provided during the procedure 
showed that fedratinib exposures were significantly reduced. Agents strongly or moderately inducing 
CYP3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampicin), including herbal agents and foods should be avoided in 
patients receiving fedratinib. Further, information on the potential effect of induction is indicated in 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC.  
Fedratinib  has  pH-dependent  solubility  and  permeability  (highly  soluble  at  low  pH,  poorly  soluble  at 
neutral pH). However, based on in vivo DDI Study INT12894 with pantoprazol, fedratinib exposure was 
not affected to a relevant extent (1.09-fold for Cmax and 1.15-fold for AUC). The fact that an increase in 
gastric pH is not expected to have impact on febratinib exposure and no dose adjustment is needed with 
concomitant administration with these drugs has been indicated in the SmPC. 
Effect fedratinib on other drugs. When given in combination with fedratinib, dose modifications of 
CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 substrate drugs should be considered, with close monitoring of safety 
and efficacy. This DDI is indicated in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC.  
It is agreed that based on the in vitro data with regards to effects of fedratinib as perpetrator on 
CYP2C8 and 2C9 substrates, no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies are considered necessary. Of 
note, the outcome of the provided PBPK simulations bear no value to this conclusion, since the PBPK 
model was not validated for this purpose. 
Based on in vitro data, an interaction between fedratinib as perpetrator and P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, 
MATE2-K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2 substrates cannot be excluded, and results of the planned in 
vivo study investigating this possibility is awaited. Of note, the outcome of the provided PBPK 
simulations bear no value to this conclusion, since the PBPK model was not validated for this purpose. 
The potential effect of fedratinib in vivo on drug transporters is unknown. Based on in vitro DDI data 
such interaction cannot yet be excluded: Results of study FEDR-CP-003 (drug transporter DDI Study) 
are due by September 2021. Until in vivo data are available, caution is advisable for agents that are 
sensitive substrates of these transporters with narrow therapeutic index. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The proof of concept for efficacy of fedratinib was shown through non-clinical in vitro and in vivo 
experiments, and thereby the mode of action is sufficiently demonstrated. In patients, fedratinib 
showed a time-dependent, but not dose-related inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in all treatment 
groups (300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg) at 2 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1. Further, several 
immune/inflammatory cytokines were downregulated. These data are supportive for JAK2 inhibition. 
There are no data on inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib 
whereas a 2-3 fold increase in EC50 was observed in case of known resistance mutations in non-
clinical studies. It remains uncertain whether the selected dose of fedratinib inhibits STAT3 
phosphorylation to the same extent as in JAK inhibitor naïve patients. Nevertheless, clinical data 
support a beneficial effect of the proposed dose in the pre-treated patients. Data regarding an effect 
(reduction) on JAK2V617F mutant allele burden are inconclusive as results differed between studies. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 60/170 
 
 
 
non-clinical studies, mutant allele burden was only reduced at high doses, which are not reached 
clinically, but complete elimination of mutant alleles was not observed in these studies. It remains 
unknown whether fedratinib could change the natural history of the disease. There were no reports on 
drug-drug interactions, however the potential for interactions was limited by the exclusion criteria. 
Interactions with agents acting through JAK2 signalling (e.g. EPO, G-CSF) may be expected, however 
the clinical impact remains unknown. The lack of data on concurrent use with haematopoietic growth 
factors is reflected in section 4.4 and 4.5. Given the lack of data, the statement on the use of G-CSF in 
case of neutropenia in section 4.2 is followed by a reference to section 4.4 and 4.5 on the lack of data. 
Further the applicant commits to follow up case reports of interactions with other agents through Janus 
Associated Kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling and comment on them in the Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs). The response to fedratinib appears independent of JAK2 mutation, though data from patients 
without JAK2 mutation were limited. Other mutations (e.g. in CALR and MPL genes) have been shown 
to be involved in aberrant JAK2-STAT signalling and response to ruxolitinib was also independent of 
JAK2 mutation. Additional information will become available from the ongoing FEDR-MF-002 Phase 3 
trial. 
Fedratinib at a dose of 500 mg did not result in a clinically relevant QTc prolongation in patients with 
solid tumours.  
Exposure-safety analyses 
Increasing fedratinib exposure at steady-state (AUC0-24,ss) appeared to be related with increased 
anaemia Grade 3 or above, thrombocytopenia of Grade 3 or above, diarrhoea of any grade, and 
nausea and vomiting of any grade. However, the baseline haemoglobin level (≤ 10g/dl vs >10 g/dl) 
and the baseline platelet count (< 100 x 109 vs ≥ 100 x 109/l) appeared to be more important for the 
occurrence of anaemia or thrombocytopenia than fedratinib exposure. In the SmPC section 4.4, it is 
indicated that treatment with fedratinib may cause anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and that complete 
blood counts should be obtained at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. 
This is agreed. It is mentioned that patients with low platelet counts (< 100 x 109/l) at the start of 
therapy are more likely to develop thrombocytopenia during treatment and patients with a 
haemoglobin level below 10.0 g/dl at the start of therapy have a higher risk of developing anaemia 
Grade 3 or above during treatment compared to patients with a higher baseline haemoglobin level, and 
more frequent monitoring of haematology parameters and of clinical signs and symptoms of fedratinib-
related adverse drug reactions is recommended for patients with baseline haemoglobin below 10.0 
g/dl. 
The exposure at a 500 mg fedratinib dose in 3 patients with potential Wernicke’s encephalopathy were 
provided. It is agreed that, although the AUCss in these patients with evaluable exposure are higher 
than the median, no conclusions can be drawn due to the low number of patients. A warning on the 
potential occurrence of WE is adequately included in SmPC section 4.4. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK and PD of fedratinib has been investigated to a fair extent. The PD is mainly based on 
non-clinical data and supported by the limited data available in patients. The submitted data 
adequately support the application.  
The potential effect of fedratinib in vivo on drug transporters is unknown. Based on in vitro DDI data 
such interaction cannot yet be excluded: Results of study FEDR-CP-003 (drug transporter DDI Study) 
are due by September 2021.  
Additional information on Pharmacodynamics will also become available from the ongoing FEDR-MF-

conducted in 2 phases in 59 patients with high-risk or intermediate-risk PMF, post-PV MF, or post-ET 
MF and with symptomatic splenomegaly and/or unresponsive to available therapy. The dose-escalation

phase was designed to determine the MTD and to evaluate its safety/tolerability, PK, PD, and 
preliminary clinical activity. The dose confirmation phase was a cohort expansion at or below the MTD 
(i.e., the RP2D). Doses from 30 mg to 800 mg QD in consecutive 28-day cycles were tested and 
680 mg/day (n=31) was determined to be the MTD. Clinical improvement was achieved in 41.8% of 
subjects (23 of 55) across doses and 48.6% (18 of 37) of subjects in the MTD cohort. The lowest dose 
at which clinical improvement was observed was 240 mg/day (2 of 3 subjects). At that time, from a 
safety perspective, doses of ≥ 520 mg resulted in more anemia and increased transfusion requirement, 
supporting the selection of the 500 mg dose for further study.  
Study ARD11936 was a phase 2 open-label dose-ranging study in 31 patients with intermediate-2 or 
high-risk PMF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF with splenomegaly to study efficacy and safety of fedratinib. 
Doses of 300 mg (n=10), 400 mg (n-10) and 500 mg (n=11) in 28-day cycles were further evaluated. 
Mean percent change in spleen volume to the End of Cycle 3 based on MRI/CT (primary endpoint) was 
-30.1%, -33.1%, and -43.3% for 300 mg, 400 mg and 500 mg fedratinib, respectively. The proportion 
of subjects with spleen RR (defined as ≥ 35% SVR at End of Cycle 3) was 30%, 50%, and 72.7% in 
the 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg group, respectively (post-hoc analysis). Corresponding results for 
EOC6 were 60.0% and 63.6% in the 400 mg and 500 mg group, respectively, compared to 30% in the 
300 mg group. Effect on symptoms was measured based using the total symptom score (TSS), defined 
as the sum of the scores for the 6 key MF-related symptoms assessed by the MPN-SAF  
(myeloproliferative neoplasm symptom assessment form):  early satiety, abdominal pain, abdominal 
discomfort, bone pain, night sweats, and itching (Post-hoc analysis). Symptom response rates of ≥ 
50% reduction in TTS at End of Cycle 3 and 6 were 44.4% and 33.3% in the 300 mg group, 40.0% 
and 60.0% in the 400 mg group, and 37.5% at both time points in the 500 mg group. The most 
common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs, all grades) in all treatment groups (at least 40% 
of subjects in each treatment group) were diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, and anemia. These were also 
the most common treatment-related TEAEs. No trends were noted in the most frequently reported 
TEAEs across the treatment groups. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in more 
subjects in the 500 mg treatment group (100%) than in the 300 mg or the 400 mg treatment groups 
(50.0% each). The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAE was anemia. Though numbers 
were small, efficacy data favored 400 mg and 500 mg over 300 mg fedratinib dose.  
Based on these data, both doses were included in the pivotal trial ECF12153 as separate arms. In 
study ARD12181, the starting dose was 400 mg QD with the option for dose-escalation up to 60 mg 
QD. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA): a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 3-arm study of fedratinib (SAR302503) in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary 
myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis 
with splenomegaly.  
Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2): a phase II, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study of fedratinib 
(SAR302503) in subjects previously treated with ruxolitinib and with a current diagnosis of 
intermediate or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-
essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. 
Methods 
Study EFC12153 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm 
study in subjects with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary MF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF with

splenomegaly. The study was designed to show the safety and efficacy of fedratinib in MF subjects 
naïve to JAK inhibitors and studied fedratinib at both 400 mg and 500 mg doses compared to placebo. 
Patients were initially randomised (1:1:1) to either placebo or fedratinib 400 mg or 500 mg. Eligible 
subjects in the placebo arm were allowed to cross over to receive treatment with 400 or 500 mg 
fedratinib (re-randomisation 1:1) after completing 6 cycles of treatment or when a subject experienced 
progressive disease (PD) prior to completing the first 6 cycles of treatment.  
Study ARD12181 was a non-randomised, open-label, single-arm, multicentre study of fedratinib in 
patients with intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk PMF, post-PV MF or post-ET 
MF previously treated with ruxolitinib. The study was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
fedratinib 400 mg in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib. The study consisted of a Screening 
Period of up to 28 days, followed by an approximately 6-month Treatment Period (6 cycles of 28 days), 
and a Follow-up Visit, which was performed approximately 30 days following the last administration of 
fedratinib. Retrospectively, subjects previously exposed to ruxolitinib were identified that met 
refractory, relapsed, or intolerant criteria as defined based on recommendations from MF experts and 
Health Authority feedback. 
Though studies were performed in different target populations, in-and exclusion criteria as well as 
endpoints largely overlap. Therefore, the method section of both studies is combined and where 
relevant differences for study ARD1281 compared to EFC12153 are presented separately. 
Study Participants  
In Study EFC12153, eligible subjects were ≥ 18 years of age and were JAK-inhibitor naïve. 
In study ARD12181, eligible subjects had had previous ruxolitinib treatment for at least 14 days

initiation of fedratinib. Subjects who had exposure to hydroxyurea in the past could be enrolled 
in study EFC12153 as long as the hydroxyurea had not been administered within 14 days prior 
to initiation of fedratinib or placebo. In study ARD12181, hydroxyurea was allowed within 1 
day prior to initiation of fedratinib. 
4.  Concomitant treatment with or use of pharmaceutical or herbal agents known to be moderate 
or severe inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). 
Other exclusions criteria were related to significant comorbidities, amongst others active hepatitis and 
prior chronic liver disease, prior malignancies (except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell 
skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which subject had been disease-free for ≥ 5 
years), active acute infection, and certain types of cardiovascular comorbidities. 
Treatments 
Fedratinib treatment 
Fedratinib (400 or 500 mg) was taken orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day, on 
an outpatient basis for at least 6 consecutive 28-day cycles. The study drug was taken on an empty 
stomach (i.e. 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Within study ARD12181, the dose could be 
uptitrated to a maximum of 600 mg daily based on response. Dose reductions or interruptions based 
on safety were allowed, the lowest dose being 200 mg/day. Subjects continued to receive fedratinib for 
as long as they showed signs of benefiting from the therapy and had not PD or relapse or unacceptable 
toxicity requiring discontinuation of study drug. 
Placebo treatment (study EFC12153) 
Placebo was taken orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day, on an outpatient basis 
for up to 6 consecutive 28-day cycles. Eligible subjects in the placebo arm were allowed to cross over 
to receive treatment with either 400 or 500 mg of fedratinib after a second 1:1 randomisation in either 
of the following 2 scenarios: 1. When a subject had completed the first 6 cycles of treatment and had 
completed the End-of-Cycle 6 imaging assessments or 2. when a subject had PD prior to completing 6 
cycles of treatment and continued to meet study entry eligibility criteria. 
Transfusions (blood/platelet), as clinically indicated were allowed. Granulocyte growth factors were 
permitted in study EFC12153, but not in study ARD12181. Other drugs for MF and erythropoietin and 
darbepoetin were prohibited. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of fedratinib on the reduction of spleen volume at the 
end of 6 treatment cycles. Secondary objectives were amongst others effect on MF symptoms, PFS and 
safety.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Spleen response rate (RR) defined as the proportion of subjects with ≥35% SVR at 
the End of Cycle 6 (EOC6) measured by MRI/computed tomography (CT) scan relative to baseline. A 
confirmatory MRI/CT was required 4 weeks later (not included in study ARD12181). The independent 
review committee (IRC) reviewed the MRI/CT images in a blinded manner. 
Secondary endpoints 
Symptom RR: Defined as the proportion of subjects with ≥50% reduction in the total symptom score 
(TSS) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6. Baseline TSS was the TSS value the week before 
randomisation or the week before an on-treatment assessment. 
TSS: Defined as the average value of the daily total score, which was calculated as the sum of the 
daily scores of the 6 items of the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF). (The 6 
symptoms according to the modified MFSAF diary are night sweats, pruritus, abdominal discomfort, 
early satiety, pain under ribs on left side, and bone or muscle pain.) All 6 key symptom scores were 
required to calculate a TSS. These symptoms were measured on a scale from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst 
imaginable, TSS = 60). 
Overall survival (OS): Defined as the time interval from the date of randomisation to the date of death 
due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, OS was censored at the last date the 
subject was known to be alive. 
Progression-free survival (PFS): Defined as the time interval from the date of randomisation to the 
date of the first investigator-assessed disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, 
whichever came first. In the absence of PD or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last valid 
assessment performed. 
Spleen RR of ≥25% SVR (RR25) at the End of Cycle 6 and confirmed 4 weeks later. The IRC reviewed 
the MRI/CT images in a blinded manner. 
Spleen RR at End of Cycle 3: Defined as the proportion of subjects who had a ≥ 35% reduction from 
baseline in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 3 as measured by MRI/CT scan (study ARD12181 only). 
Duration of spleen response: Defined as the time from the date of the first response by IRC to the date 
of subsequent PD by IRC or death, whichever was earlier. 
Safety assessment of fedratinib. 
Of note, OS and PFS in EFC12153 were not analysed as the required number of 126 events was not 
reached due to early (follow-up) discontinuation. Endpoints/measurements beyond 6 cycles of 
treatment were not assessed in study ARD12181 due to early study discontinuation. 
Sample size 
Study ECF12153: Calculation was based on spleen RR, assuming the RR was 30% in either fedratinib 
arm and 5% in the placebo arm, 63 subjects per arm would provide 90% power at a 2-sided 2.5% 
alpha level. Assuming there was about a 15% dropout rate, the RR would be 26% in either fedratinib 
arm and 4.3% in the placebo arm in the intent-to-treat (ITT) Population. Thus, 75 subjects per study 
arm (total 225 subjects) were planned to be randomised. 
Study ARD12181: Assuming the primary endpoint, spleen RR, was 25%, then 70 evaluable subjects 
were to provide at least 90% power at a 1-sided 2.5% α-level to test the null hypothesis of ≤ 10% RR. 
This also provided sufficient power for the subgroup of patients that had not responded to previous 
ruxolitinib treatment.

Randomisation and Blinding  
Study EFC12153: Randomisation and treatment allocation was performed centrally via Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS) to 400 mg fedratinib, 500 mg fedratinib, or placebo treatment in a 
1:1:1 ratio. A subject could be randomised by IVRS more than once in the study if they crossed over 
from placebo to fedratinib. Rerandomisation from placebo to either 400 or 500 mg fedratinib was 1:1. 
At the time of rerandomisation, the IVRS system determined which treatment the subject had received 
in their initial randomisation and either:  
1) rerandomised those subjects who had initially been treated with placebo to active drug or  
2) assigned subjects who had initially received one of the active doses to their same treatment. 
No stratification criteria were applied for these randomisations. 
The study was double-blind. Following rerandomisation, treatment with fedratinib was open label; 
however, the blind for dose level was maintained. 
Not applicable for Study ARD12181 which was a single arm, open label uncontrolled study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) and ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) 
●  The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population included all randomised subjects (in ARD12181 
(JAKARTA2) all enrolled subjects). 
●  All Treated (AT) Population: subjects who took ≥ 1 dose (even if partial) of study 
medication. 
●  The Symptom Analysis Population (modified MFSAF Population) included subjects 
evaluable at baseline for symptom assessment. All analyses using this population were based 
on the treatment assigned by IVRS. (In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) ITT subjects). 
●  Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population: subjects who received at least 1 (even partial) cycle of 
study drug (study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) / ≥ 1 dose of study drug (study ARD12181 
(JAKARTA2) and had evaluable drug concentration data. 
Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA)  
●  The Evaluable Subjects15 (EP) Population consisted of the subset of the ITT Population with a 
paired baseline and at least 1 post baseline MRI (CT in case of contraindications for MRI), and 
who had received a minimum of 50% of the targeted dose for 3 cycles, or who had progressed 
or died within first 3 treatment cycles. All analyses using this population were based on the 
treatment actually received. 
●  The Bone Marrow Fibrosis Population included subjects evaluable at baseline and with a 
post-baseline assessment evaluable according to central review, and who had received a 
minimum of 50% of the targeted dose for 3 cycles. Subjects evaluable at baseline were those 
with bone marrow fibrosis Grade > 0 by central review at baseline. All analyses using this 
population were based on the treatment assigned by IVRS. 
●  The PD Population comprised subjects who received at least 1 full cycle of study drug and 
who had evaluable PD marker concentration data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 69/170 
 
 
 
●  The PK/PD-ECG Population consisted of the subset of the All Treated Population with at least 
1 paired ECG and predicted plasma fedratinib concentration data. Data from subjects after 
rerandomisation were not taken into account. 
Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2)  
•  Per-protocol (PP) Population: treated subjects with evaluable baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline 
MRI/CT scan of spleen volume, and no important protocol deviations that could impact the 
efficacy outcome. 
•  Thiamine Supplementation Follow-up Population: subjects who took ≥ 1 dose of study 
drug and had at least 1 dose of thiamine during the Follow-up Period. 
Safety Populations Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA)  
●  The All Treated Population was used for analysis of exposure and safety data before crossover. 
All analyses using this population were based on the treatment actually received. Randomised 
subjects for whom it was unclear whether they took the study drug were included in the Safety 
Population as randomised. 
●  The Crossover Safety Population included all subjects from the placebo arm who crossed over 
to receive fedratinib. This population was used for analysis of exposure and safety data after 
the crossover date. 
Planned analyses 
Study ECF12153: 
The ITT Population was the primary analysis population for all efficacy parameters. All analyses using 
this population were based on the treatment assigned by IVRS. 
Primary endpoint (RR): primary analysis was a Chi-square test for each dose vs placebo at 2.5% two-
sided alpha, with 97.5%-CI based on normal approximation for each dose to placebo. The primary 
analysis regarded as non-responders: 1) patients without valid end cycle 6 assessment, 2) patients 
without a 4-weeks-later confirmation of the end cycle 6 assessment, and 3) patients with PD before 
end cycle 6. Secondary analyses regarded only 1) and 3) as non-responders. Sensitivity analyses 
included: the primary analysis but imputing patients without valid end cycle 6 assessment by the last 
available post-baseline value and requiring 3) to be non-responders. 
Secondary endpoint TSS: the primary analysis is as for RR, with subjects with a missing TSS at the 
end of cycle 6 and patients with disease progression considered non-responders. One secondary 
analysis imputes the last observation carried forward (progression before end of cycle 6 again regarded 
as non-response).  
Type 1 error was controlled by Bonferroni splitting for the two comparisons of doses vs placebo and 
within that by fixed sequence testing of: spleen RR ->TSS -> spleen RR using 25% cut-off -> OS -> 
PFS (the latter two not analysed). No interim analysis was performed. 
Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) 
The Per-protocol (PP) Population was to be used as the primary analysis population (reported in 
ARD12181 main CSR). 
In the ARD12181 CSR Addendum, all analyses were done on the ITT Population (i.e., all subjects 
enrolled in the study who met the criteria for either R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib).

NOTE:   
Main Clinical Study Report (CSR) for study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) 
Study ARD12181 was initiated shortly after ruxolitinib was approved and at the time, there were no 
well-established criteria to define resistance or intolerance. Therefore, the original inclusion (protocol 
Sanofi Aventis) was based on investigators’ judgement of relapsed/refractory or intolerant to 
ruxolitinib. To be eligible for the study, subjects were only required to have been treated with 
ruxolitinib for 14 days at a minimum. 
In the main CSR for study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), results and analyses are presented according to the 
investigators’ judgement of relapsed/refractory or intolerant. 
ARD12181 CSR Addendum,  
Patients were also classified retrospectively as relapsed/refractory or intolerant to ruxolitinib according 
to criteria based on a meeting with MF experts from the United States (US) and European Union (EU) 
in April 2018 (with applicant Celgene) and these criteria were discussed with regulatory authorities. 
The criteria were applied to the baseline information that was prospectively collected in the eCRF and 
adverse events (AEs) associated with prior ruxolitinib treatment were also collected. 
In the ARD12181 CSR Addendum, results and analyses are presented for subjects who were 
reclassified as R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib if they met at least one of the following criteria: 
Relapsed: < 30% reduction in spleen size (or < 10% reduction in spleen volume) at the end of 
ruxolitinib treatment compared to baseline after an initial response (as defined below). Subjects must 
have had treatment with ruxolitinib for ≥ 3 months. Response to ruxolitinib is defined as: ≥ 50% 
reduction in spleen size for baseline spleen > 10 cm (or ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from 
baseline); non-palpable spleen for baseline spleen between 5 and 10 cm; not eligible for spleen 
response for baseline spleen < 5 cm. 
Refractory: < 30% reduction in spleen size (or < 10% reduction in spleen volume) at the end of 
ruxolitinib treatment compared to baseline and failure to meet criteria for response (as defined above) 
during ruxolitinib treatment. Subjects must have had treatment with ruxolitinib for ≥ 3 months. 
Intolerant: ruxolitinib treatment for ≥ 28 days complicated by either (i) the development of red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion requirement (≥ 2 units/month for 2 months), or (ii) toxicity defined as Grade ≥ 
3 AEs of thrombocytopenia, anaemia, haematoma, and/or haemorrhage while on treatment with 
ruxolitinib. 
The subjects who met the above criteria were grouped into the following cohorts (ARD12181 CSR 
Addendum): 
Cohort 1: all subjects who were relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to ruxolitinib treatment per the 
above criteria. This cohort includes 79 subjects out of the 97 subjects enrolled in Study ARD12181. 
Cohort 1a: a “subgroup” of Cohort 1 that includes 66 of the 79 subjects who were R/R or intolerant to 
ruxolitinib treatment per the above criteria and who, at the time of the early study termination, either: 
1. had received Cycle 6 of fedratinib treatment, OR 
2. had discontinued fedratinib treatment before Cycle 6 due to reasons other than “Study terminated 
by the sponsor” (ie, had discontinued due to an “AE,” “Withdrawal of consent,” “Investigator decision,” 
or “Progressive disease”). 
The final Sanofi statistical analysis plan (SAP) (11 JUN 2014) was abbreviated by the early termination 
of treatment and by the fact that all efficacy assessments were terminated.

only the primary efficacy endpoint, spleen RR (≥ 35% SVR), and certain secondary endpoints 
(symptom RR, spleen RR [≥ 35% SVR] at the End of Cycle 3, spleen RR by palpation at End of 
Cycle 6, and percent change of spleen volume at the End of Cycle 3 and 6) were planned to be 
analysed, instead of all endpoints listed in the protocol . 
the chi square test for testing whether the primary endpoint was > 10%, was omitted.  
The primary efficacy analysis population was the PP Population. This way the effect in subjects 
with a baseline and post-baseline measurements could be described using last observation 
carried forward LOCF.  
Primary endpoint: the LOCF method was planned in the Protocol and Final Sanofi SAP: missing 
spleen volume at End of Cycle 6 was imputed with the end of cycle 3 (Day 1 Cycle 4) 
measurement unless a subject had progression before end of cycle 6. 
The symptom response was based on the modified MFSAF: all patients that are treated, have 
an evaluable baseline assessment of total symptom scores and at least one post-baseline 
evaluable assessment. Missing data was imputed as ‘no event’ (note that for the primary 
endpoint LOCF was used). 
•  An interim analysis for futility after approximately one-third of subjects were enrolled and 
completed 3 cycles of fedratinib treatment. If there is insufficient evidence of efficacy and/or 
unacceptable toxicity, the study would be stopped; this interim report was used for regulatory 
purposes. 
Celgene included additional analyses (Celgene Supportive Statistical Document for the CSR, dated 28 
Nov 2018) to address the potential bias that may have resulted from the administrative closure of the 
fedratinib programme by the former sponsor (Sanofi). These included: 
•  Addition of Cohort 1 and cohort 1a (Cohort 1a patients had a primary endpoint measurement 
before the termination of the trial and was intended to provide analyses as if the trial had not 
terminated early). 
•  All analyses in the CSR addendum were performed on Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a. 
• 
• 
• 
Primary endpoint will analysed on the ITT set (not only the PP) and missing data for end of 
cycle 6 will not be imputed by LOCF on the end of cycle 3 value, but will be considered as non-
responders (non-responder imputation). 
The secondary endpoints as above in the Sanofi break-off statistical analysis plan were 
analysed, but with additional analyses: not only on PP, but also on ITT;  
subgroup analyses for spleen RR by current expert criteria for R/R vs intolerant for both end of 
cycle 3 and 6, spleen reductions / response rate at end of cycle 6 without LOCF imputation  
endpoints additional to the Sanofi break-off statistical analysis were analysed:  
o  duration of spleen response, spleen response using a ≥25% threshold, quality of life (QoL) 
using quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ-C30). These endpoints were already 
present in the last Sanofi protocol that was not impacted by early termination (v3, 28 NOV 
2012).  
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint were performed according to clinically relevant 
demographic factors and baseline disease/prognosis characteristics.

Study ARD12181: Subgroup analyses by the subgroups R/R vs intolerant based on the investigators’ 
judgements (Sanofi) were also performed. Based on current experts’ criteria (Celgene) the latter 
subgroups were also provided and by baseline platelet count. Both these analyses are without LOCF 
imputation and on both the ITT and PP set. 
Results – Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) 
Participant flow 
Figure 15: Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Study EFC12153 was performed at 94 active centres in 24 countries in Europe, US, Canada, Brazil, 
Israel, Australia, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan. 
Randomisation of subjects occurred from 10 Jan 2012 to 24 Sep 2012. 
First subject enrolled: 22 Dec 2011.  Last subject completed: 25 Jun 2014. 
Subject Dispostion 
Of 351 subjects screened, 62 subjects were screen failures (i.e. did not meet the eligibility criteria and  
289 subjects (ITT population) were randomised in the study:96 to 400 mg; 97 to 500 mg; 96 to 
placebo (Table 23). One subject randomised to placebo died before receiving treatment. The All 
Treated Population consisted thus of 288 subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 73/170 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 71 subjects in the placebo arm were rerandomised: 35 subjects to fedratinib 400 mg and 36 
subjects to 500 mg (see Participants’ flow above Figure 15). There were 10 subjects with early 
crossover before the End of Cycle 6 and 61 subjects rerandomised after completion of Cycle 6. 
For the 25 placebo subjects who were not rerandomised to fedratinib, the reasons for permanent 
treatment discontinuation were AE (N=8), PD (ie, not eligible for crossover) N=4), and “other” (N=13).  
In the 400 and 500 mg arms, the most common reason for permanent treatment discontinuation was 
“other reason” (63.5% and 53.6%, respectively), primarily study termination by Sanofi. 
The frequency of fedratinib-treated subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs was 
lower in the 400 mg arm than in the 500 mg arm (26/96 subjects, 27.1% and 35/97 subjects, 36.1%, 
respectively). 
For permanent discontinuation of treatment due to PD, the frequencies of fedratinib-treated subjects 
were 6.3% in the 400 mg arm and 3.1% in the 500 mg arm. 
At the time of study termination, 144 subjects were still receiving fedratinib: 
51/96 subjects randomised to 400 mg, 45/97 subjects randomised to 500 mg, 26 subjects who 
crossed over from placebo to 400 mg, and 22 subjects who crossed over from placebo to 500 mg. 
The last fedratinib administration for this study was on 02 Dec 2013, by which date all 289 subjects 
had permanently discontinued treatment. The last subject’s last visit was on 25 Jun 2014, which 
includes all available information on the 90-day Thiamine Supplementation Period. 
Disposition of Subjects up to 6 Cycles 
At the time of study termination, all subjects had either completed the first 6 cycles or had previously 
permanently discontinued treatment. 
Altogether 76 (26.4%) subjects had permanently discontinued treatment before the end of Cycle 6:  
21 (21.9%) subjects in the 400 mg arm, 31 (32.0%) subjects in the 500 mg arm, and 24 (25.3%) in 
the placebo arm (Table 23). 
The most frequent reason for permanent treatment discontinuation up to 6 cycles in the fedratinib 
arms was Adverse Event (71 subjects, 15.6%), the rate being higher in the 500 mg arm (24 subjects, 
24.7%) than in the 400 mg arm (13 subjects, 13.5%). In the placebo arm 8 subjects (8.4%) 
discontinued up to 6 cycles due to adverse events and 10 subjects due to early crossover.  
Of the 76 subjects who permanently discontinued treatment by the End of Cycle 6, the majority (52 
subjects; 68.4%) discontinued in the first 3 cycles:  
25.0% (19/76) in Cycle 1; 22.4% (17/76) in Cycle 2; 21.1% (16/76) in Cycle 3; 11.8% (9/76) in 
Cycle 4; 9.2% (7/76) in Cycle 5; 10.5% (8/76) in Cycle 6. 
The majority of the 45 subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE up to 6 cycles 
discontinued during the first 3 cycles: 
500 mg arm: 18/24 (75.0%); 400 mg arm: 7/13 (53.8%); Placebo arm:  6/8 (75.0%). 
Disposition of Subjects After Crossover 
After crossover, the most common reason for permanent treatment discontinuation was “other reason” 
(82.9% and 63.9%, respectively), primarily study termination by Sanofi. 
Permanent treatment discontinuation due to AEs was less frequent in placebo subjects who crossed 
over to 400 mg than in subjects who crossed over to 500 mg (6 subjects, 17.1% and 12 subjects, 
33.3%, respectively) (Table 23). These results are consistent with the pattern of reasons for 
permanent treatment discontinuation in subjects initially randomised to fedratinib.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Deviations 
Important quantitative deviations were those identified from the clinical data available in the clinical 
database. Overall, 14.5% of all subjects in the ITT Population had ≥ 1 important protocol deviation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 75/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13.5% in the placebo arm, 11.5% in the 400 mg arm, and 18.6% in the 500 mg arm, the most 
common being a rerandomisation issue. At rerandomisation, to protect the blind, subjects previously 
randomised to either 400 or 500 mg of fedratinib maintained the same dose level in a blinded fashion 
and were not permitted to cross over to a different dose level. Thus rerandomisation deviations would 
have only been expected to have an impact on subjects who received placebo past Cycle 6, which 
occurred for 3 subjects. As rerandomisation occurred after Cycle 6 (i.e. after assessment of the 
primary and other key efficacy endpoints) rerandomisation deviations had no impact on the 
interpretation of data. For 8 (2.8%) subjects, 2 subjects in the placebo arm and 6 subjects in the 500 
mg arm, the treatment kit dispensed was not the same as the treatment kit authorised by IVRS. 
Important qualitative deviations (i.e. that could not be derived using the clinical data based on the 
data review and surveillance plan and were identified by Sanofi during conduct of the study) at a 
minimum included critical audit observations, scientific misconduct, site closures due to 
noncompliance, and specific reasons for excluding site data in analysis. The most significant of these 
concerned one subject  in the placebo arm who, although PD was shown in Cycle 4, did not crossover 
to active treatment at that time and another subject, who was initially randomised to the placebo arm, 
but continued to receive placebo after completing Cycle 6. 
Significant GCP Noncompliance 
During Study EFC12153, Sanofi observed and addressed significant GCP noncompliance at 2 study 
sites (one in Hungary and one in the UK). The deviations did not lead to exclusion of subjects from the 
ITT Population, as it was considered that none would affect the interpretation of the results. At the UK 
site (4 subjects randomised)/UK: A subject was screened and registered in the IVRS, but informed 
consent was not obtained due to a miscommunication between site staff. The investigator reported the 
case, with the corrective and preventive action plan, to the UK central ethics committee and the 
Research and Development office of the site. At the Hungary site (3 subjects randomised)/Hungary: 
Following persistent significant GCP noncompliance despite several actions put in place by the 
monitoring team, Sanofi decided to terminate the trial at this site. The subjects were transferred to 
another site, and the case was notified to the local ethics committee, the local health authority, and 
the US Food and Drug Administration. A directed site inspection conducted by the local health authority 
confirmed the notified significant GCP non-compliance. 
Baseline data 
Demographic Characteristics 
The ITT Population consisted of 58.8% men and 41.2% women; subjects were mostly white (88.9%) 
and had a median age of 65.0 years (Table 24). The proportion of subjects who were ≤65 years of age 
was higher in the 400 mg arm (63.5%) compared with the placebo and 500 mg arms (45.8% and 
50.5%, respectively). Overall, 9.0% of the ITT Population was older than 75 years. The highest 
proportion of subjects in each of the 3 treatment arms lived in Western Europe (43.6% overall) and 
Eastern Europe (26.0% overall) (Table 24). In general, demographic characteristics were well balanced 
across the 3 treatment arms.

or 3 (48.8%). Overall, 73.7% of subjects had constitutional symptoms, and most subjects (93.4%) 
were not transfusion dependent. Most subjects had an ECOG PS score of 0 (35.6%) or 1 (54.7%). The 
median baseline TSS (using modified MFSAF) for all subjects was 14.7. The majority of all subjects 
(70.6%) had a spleen size > 10 cm. Prior hydroxyurea was taken by 63.0% of all subjects. 
The disease characteristics at baseline were generally well balanced across the 3 treatment arms, with 
the following exceptions: 
−  The median time since diagnosis of MF was longer in the 400 mg arm (43.0 months) than in the 
placebo and 500 mg arms (28.3 and 22.0 months, respectively). 
−  A lower proportion of subjects in the 400 mg arm had high-risk status (40.6%) compared with the 
placebo and 500 mg arms (52.1% and 51.5%, respectively). 
−  A higher proportion of subjects in the 500 mg arm had mutant JAK2 profile (74.2%) compared with 
the placebo and 400 mg arms (61.5% and 64.6%, respectively). 
−  A higher proportion of subjects in the 400 mg arm had a baseline ECOG PS score of 0 (42.7%) 
compared with the placebo and 500 mg arms (32.3% and 32.0%, respectively). 
−  The median baseline TSS was lower in the placebo arm (12.43) compared with the 400 and 500 
mg arms (15.3 and 16.0, respectively). 
−  A higher proportion of subjects in the 400 mg arm had received prior hydroxyurea (71.9%) 
compared with the placebo and 500 mg arms (56.3% and 60.8%, respectively).

Baseline Spleen Volume and Spleen Size 
The overall median spleen volume at baseline was 2568 mL (Table 26), which is approximately 12 
times the median normal spleen volume of 215 mL (Prassopoulos, 1997). The median spleen size at

Baseline Total Symptom Score by Modified MFSAF 
Median baseline TSS in the Symptom Analysis Population was 14.1 for the placebo arm, 15.3 for the 
400 mg arm, and 16.1 for the 500 mg arm (Table 27).

Prior myelofibrosis therapies 
Per the study entry criteria, no subject in this study had received prior treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor. 
Most (73.4%) subjects had received prior therapy for MF, but this was somewhat lower in the placebo 
arm (65.6%) than in the 400 and 500 mg arms (80.2% and 74.2%), respectively (Table 28). 
Most subjects had received only 1 prior MF therapy: 71.4% in the placebo arm, 77.6% in the 400 and 
81.7% in the 500 mg arm. Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) was the most frequently used prior MF 
therapy among all subjects (63.0%), with a higher usage in the 400 mg arm (71.9%) compared with 
the placebo and 500 mg arms (56.3% and 60.8%, respectively). Other frequently used therapies were 
immunomodulatory agents (18.7% overall) and corticosteroids (10.4% overall).

Baseline Haematology 
The median values for baseline haematology parameters were generally similar for the 3 treatment 
arms. 
The median Hb concentration at baseline for all subjects was 10.2 g/dL. The baseline Hb concentration 
was ≤10 g/dL for 45.8% of all subjects, with a lower proportion in the 400 mg arm (34.4%) than in 
the placebo and 500 mg arms (49.5% and 53.6%, respectively).  
The median platelet count at baseline for all subjects was 213.5 x 109/L, most subjects (83.7%) had 
platelet counts ≥100 x 109/L.  
The median WBC count at baseline for all subjects was 11.8 x 109/L; 26.0% of all subjects had a WBC 
count ≥25 x 109/L at baseline.  
The percentage of all subjects with baseline blood blasts ≥1% was 54.5%.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Spleen Response Rate  
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint was spleen response rate (RR) which was defined as the proportion of 
subjects with ≥35% SVR at the End of Cycle 6 (EOC6). A confirmatory MRI/CT was required 4 weeks 
later. The IRC reviewed the MRI/CT images in a blinded manner. 
The study met the primary endpoint. For the ITT Population, the spleen RR at the End of Cycle 6 
confirmed 4 weeks later was 36.5% in the 400 mg arm and 40.2% in the 500 mg arm compared with 
1.0% in the placebo arm (Table 30). Both active treatment arms showed clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant differences compared with placebo (p < 0.0001, 2-sided at a significance level = 
0.025 for each comparison).

Table 30: Spleen response rate (≥35% SVR) at the EOC6 confirmed 4 Weeks later (primary 
endpoint) and at the EOC6 (ITT Population) Study EFC12153 
When spleen volume reduction (SVR) was assessed without the requirement of confirmation 4 weeks 
later, the proportion of subjects who had ≥35% SVR was 46.9%, 49.5%, and 1.0% in the 400 mg, 
500 mg and placebo arms, respectively. For 19 subjects without confirmation of SVR, 12 subjects had 
a SVR<35%, and for 5 subjects the confirmatory scan was not performed. 
For the Evaluable Subjects Population (EP), the spleen RR at the End of Cycle 6 confirmed 4 weeks 
later was 1.2% (1/82) for the placebo arm, 39.8% (35/88) for the 400 mg arm, and 51.3% (39/76) 
for the 500 mg arm. 
Spleen RR for Placebo Crossover Subjects After Fedratinib Treatment 
For the placebo crossover subjects rerandomised to fedratinib after the initial randomisation period, 
the spleen RR at the End of Cycle 6 after fedratinib treatment was 28.6% (10/35) in the 400 mg 
arm and 44.4% (16/36) in the 500 mg arm. 
Percentage Change in Spleen Volume at the End of Cycle 6 
The mean percentage change in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 6 in the ITT Population with 
available baseline and EOC6 assessments were 10.3% in the placebo arm, -35.6% in the 400 mg arm, 
and -42.3% in the 500 mg arm. Each active treatment arm showed a significant SVR compared with 
placebo using a 2-sample t-test (p < 0.001) (Table 31). The results for percentage change in spleen 
volume at the End of Cycle 6 for the EP Population were similar to the corresponding results for the ITT 
Population.

At the End of Cycle 6, most subjects treated with fedratinib at either 400 mg (72/75; 96.0%) or 500 
mg (63/65; 96.9%) had some degree of SVR. In contrast, a majority of subjects in the placebo arm 
(44/58; 75.9%) had an increase in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 6 (EOC6).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Symptom Response Rate using the modified MFSAF (Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment 
Form) 
The 6 key MF-associated symptoms were assessed using the modified MFSAF and measured on a scale 
from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable, TSS=60), thus reduction in TSS suggests improvement in 
symptom burden. 
The compliance rate of the modified MFSAF (i.e., number of subjects with questionnaires completed) 
was ≥85.6% in each treatment arm at each cycle. 
At baseline, 89.5% of subjects in the placebo arm, 94.8% of subjects in the 400 mg arm, and 93.8% 
of subjects in the 500 mg arm had evaluable data (at least 5 assessments available within the week 
before the next cycle).  
At Cycle 6, the numbers of subjects evaluable at cycle 6 in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg arms 
were 56, 75 and 62 respectively. 
The primary reasons for noncompliance (> 2 subjects at any assessment) were subject refusal, 
technical issues, failure to distribute the questionnaire, and “other” reason (not specified). 
The requirements to have all of the symptoms scores for each day, and to have symptom scores from 
5/7 days to calculate the weekly score, require high compliance and may exclude patients faring 
poorly, and thus unable or unwilling to complete the symptom scoring. The applicant provided data on 
excluded symptom evaluations, and presented the data based on all available assessments (as an 
average of the daily symptom scores), i.e., including data from patients from whom at least one 
complete symptom assessment is available from the given treatment cycle. Very few subjects (0 to 5 
per treatment arm) had symptoms excluded from the CSR analyses of symptom RR. The differences in 
the number of symptom scores and proportion of responders was similar between the original analysis 
and the analysis utilizing all available symptoms scores. TSS was available from 82% of patients who 
had a baseline score available in the 400mg group at EOC6. As the results are consistent, and a low 
proportion of assessments are missing, the missing assessments are considered unlikely to 
significantly alter the reported results. 
Symptom Response Rate – ITT Population With Non-missing Baseline TSS 
The study met its key secondary endpoint, symptom RR (using the modified MFSAF). The proportion of 
subjects in the ITT Population with non-missing baseline TSS (including subjects with baseline TSS = 
0) who had ≥50% reduction in the TSS from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 was 8.2% (7/85) in the 
placebo arm, 39.6% (36/91) in the 400 mg arm, and 34.1% (31/91) in the 500 mg arm (Table 32). 
Both active treatment arms showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences 
compared with placebo based on a step-down procedure for controlling multiplicity of the statistical 
comparison (p < 0.0001, 2-sided at a significance level = 0.025 for each comparison versus placebo).

Subjects in the ITT Population with non-missing baseline total symptom score Study 
EFC12153 
Symptom Response Rate – Symptom Analysis Population 
The Symptom Analysis Population (modified MFSAF) included ITT subjects evaluable at baseline (for 
symptom assessment) and Total Symptom Score >0 (Subjects without a baseline TSS > 0 were 
considered non-evaluable, due to no place for symptom reduction), in contrast to the ITT Population 
With Non-missing Baseline TSS which included subjects with baseline TSS = 0.).  
At the End of Cycle 6, the symptom RR (≥50% reduction in TSS) for the Symptom Analysis Population 
was 8.6% (7/81) in the placebo arm, 40.4% (36/89) n the 400 mg arm, and 34.8% (31/89) in the 500 
mg arm. These results are similar to those of the ITT Population. 
Symptom improvement in the 400 and 500 mg arms was evident as early as the End of Cycle 1, and 
this improvement was maintained up to the End of Cycle 6 (Table 33).  More than one quarter of 
fedratinib-treated subjects (30.3% in the 400 mg arm and 27.0% in the 500 mg arm) achieved ≥50% 
reduction in the TSS at the End of Cycle 1. From End of Cycle 2 onwards, the symptom RR did not 
increase appreciably and from Cycles 3 to 6, the symptom RR remained ≥38.2% for the 400 mg arm 
and ≥33.7% for the 500 mg arm. 
Subjects without a baseline TSS > 0 were considered nonevaluable (due to no room for symptom 
reduction) for the symptom RR analysis. 4.2% and 2.1% of the patients had a baseline TSS of 0. 
Analysis excluding the patients with a TSS of 0 (symptom analysis population) showed a higher 
symptom response of 40.4% in fedratinib 400mg/day group. Two of the 4 subjects who were 
randomised to fedratinib and who had TSS = 0 at baseline had a spleen response (SVR ≥ 35%) at the 
EOC6, both treated with 500mg/day dose. 
Of the 67 subjects in the fedratinib 400 mg arm who had data for spleen volume and TSS at baseline 
and at the EOC6, 24 (35.8%) subjects had both spleen and symptom response, 16 (23.9%) subjects 
had only spleen response, 11 (16.4%) subjects had only symptom response, and 16 (23.9%) subjects 
had neither spleen nor symptom response. However, most patients had some improvement in both 
endpoints, even if failing to meet the success criteria.

Percent Change in Total Symptom Score 
The waterfall plot for the Symptom Analysis Population (Figure 17) summarises the percentage change 
in modified MFSAF TSS at the End of Cycle 6 with available End-of-Cycle 6 assessment. The majority of 
subjects in the 400 mg (56/71; 78.9%) and 500 mg (48/57; 84.2%) arms had an improved TSS (ie, 
TSS percentage change <0) at the End of Cycle 6, whereas one half of the subjects in the placebo arm 
(25/49; 51.0%) had a worse TSS at the End of Cycle 6. 
Comparison of symptom scores between groups was possible only in the placebo-controlled period of 6 
cycles, and symptom assessment (TSS) was not evaluated after EOC6. While it is agreed that 
symptom evaluation has the highest value during the placebo-controlled phase of the study, durability 
of the symptom response is also of interest. Only EQ-5D1 data were collected after the EOC6 (at the 
End of Treatment (EOT), and at the 30-day Follow-up visit). EQ-5D utility index scores were similar at 
EOC6 and EOT. The number of patients with data from 30-day follow-up visit is too low to draw any 
conclusions, but overall, no dramatic changes were observed. Overall, the data presented suggest 
relatively stable QoL throughout the treatment period.

Individual Symptoms from Modified MFSAF 
Reduction in Individual Symptom Scores is summarised below for the Symptom Analysis Population 
(ITT subjects with baseline Total Symptom Score > 0). 
The 3 key individual symptoms tangential to the spleen: At the End of Cycle 6, subjects in the 400 and 
500 mg arms respectively versus the placebo arm had median percentage changes from baseline 
of larger than -50.0%: 
Abdominal discomfort:   
-50.0% and -52.4% versus +4.0%,  
Early satiety: 
-66.6% and -67.4% versus +6.1%, 
Pain under ribs on left side: 
-61.4% and -61.1% versus -7.0%. 
For subjects in the 400 and 500 mg arms versus the placebo arm the median percentage changes in 
the remaining symptom scores were: 
Night sweats: 
-84.2% and -100.0% versus -13.5%,  
Bone or muscle pain: 
-27.6% and -30.0% versus +6.5%,  
Itching:  
-46.7% and -53.1% versus -35.6%. 
The proportion of subjects in the Symptom Analysis Population with at least a 50% improvement in 
each of the individual symptoms that comprised the TSS (shown in Figure 18) indicate that all 6 of the 
symptoms contributed to the higher TSS response rate in the group treated with fedratinib 400 mg as 
compared to placebo.

Spleen Response Rate (≥25% SVR) at the End of Cycles 3 and 6 
The RR25 (with 95% confidence intervals) for the ITT Population (n=96 in placebo and 400 mg arms 
and n=97 in the 500 mg arm) was for the placebo, 400mg and 500 mg arms respectively: 
-   at the End of Cycle 3:  1.0% (0, 3.1) in the placebo arm, 58.3% (48.5, 68.2) in the 400 mg arm, 
and 61.9% (52.2, 71.5) in the 500 mg arm respectively and 
-   at the End of Cycle 6:  2.1% (0, 4.9), 56.3% (46.3, 66.2), and 56.7% (46.8, 66.6), respectively. 
Overall Survival and Progression-free Survival 
No analyses were provided for the PFS or OS endpoints because of the short median follow-up time 
(i.e. due to the early termination of the study), which was approximately 575 days for each treatment 
arm (range = 568 to 580 days). 
Duration of spleen response 
The duration of spleen response (≥35% SVR) was defined as the time from the date of the first IRC-
assessed response to the date of subsequent IRC-assessed PD or death, whichever was earlier. It was 
determined for subjects who achieved spleen response at any time during treatment or during the 
period before crossover for the placebo arm (i.e., responders). 
Due to early termination of the study, and subsequent extensive censoring, Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
used to estimate duration of spleen response. Subjects without subsequent IRC-assessed PD or death 
were censored at the last assessment date. 
The ITT Population included 54 and 57 IRC-assessed spleen responders in the 400 and 500 mg arms, 
respectively (Table 34). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the median duration of spleen response in 
the fedratinib arms was 18.2 months in the 400 mg arm and 19.7 months in the 500 mg arm. 
During the study, in 11.1% (6/54) and 14.0% (8/57) of responders in the 400 and 500 mg arms, 
respectively, the response ended due to PD or death. 
One placebo subject had IRC-assessed spleen response before crossover at End of Cycle 3 and then 
crossed over to receive fedratinib 500 mg at End of Cycle 6 after which further SVR was observed. This 
placebo crossover subject did not have a PD/death event throughout the study, and thus was censored 
at 16.7 months.

Effect of fedratinib on the JAK2V617F allele burden  
In subjects who were determined to have the JAK2V617F mutant allele in peripheral blood 
granulocytes at baseline, the allele burden for this mutation was also measured on Day 1 of Cycle 4, at 
the End of Cycle 6, at the beginning of every third cycle thereafter (ie, Cycles 9, 12, etc) for 2 years, 
and at the End of Treatment. 
Fifty-nine (61.5%), 62 (64.6%), and 72 (74.2%) subjects in the placebo, 400 mg, and 500 mg arms, 
respectively, had the JAK2V617F mutant allele at baseline. No significant changes in JAK2V617F allele 
burden were observed at Cycle 3 or Cycle 6 relative to the baseline in any of the treatment arms. 
Health Related Quality of Life 
Change in HRQOL and utility using the EQ-5D questionnaire were assessed at baseline and compared 
with the End of Cycle 6 and to the End of Treatment. The mean (SD) of the EQ-5D utility index score 
at baseline was 0.72 (0.256) in the placebo arm, 0.70 (0.245) in the 400 mg arm, and 0.67 (0.286) in 
the 500 mg arm. Mean change from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 was +0.05 (95% CI = 0 to 0.09) in 
the 400 mg arm and +0.04 (95% CI = -0.01 to 0.10) in the 500 mg arm versus -0.05 (95% CI = -
0.11 to 0.01) in the placebo arm. 
The visual analog scale (VAS) in EQ-5D recorded the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical scale 
with endpoints of 100 (best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (worst imaginable health state) 
at the bottom. 
Baseline health status measured by the (EQ-5D VAS) scores (ITT Population) was similar in the 3 
arms: mean (SD) was 62.5 (21.2) in the placebo arm, 61.3 (22.2) in the 400 mg arm, and 60.1 (20.1) 
in the 500 mg arm. Subjects treated with fedratinib at both doses experienced improvement in HRQOL 
versus placebo at the End of Cycle 6, as measured by the EQ-5D. At the End of Cycle 6, there was a 
mean change of +6.2 (95% CI = 1.8 to 10.5) in the 400 mg arm and +3.6 (95% CI = -1.0 to 8.2) in 
the 500 mg arm, whereas placebo treatment led to slight worsening of HRQOL (mean change of -0.9 
[95% CI = -7.7 to 5.8]). 
A higher proportion of subjects in the 400 mg arm versus the placebo arm reported improvement for 
the EQ-5D dimensions especially for mobility (12.5% versus 4.3%), usual activities (11.5% versus

5.4%), and pain/discomfort (14.6% versus 3.2%). The percentages of subjects having reported 
worsening were comparable between treatment arms. 
A higher proportion of subjects in the 500 mg arm versus the placebo arm reported improvement for 
the EQ-5D dimensions of usual activities (12.5% versus 5.4%) and pain/discomfort (14.5% versus 
3.2%). The percentages of subjects having reported worsening were slightly lower in the 500 mg arm.

Spleen Response Rate by Baseline Platelet Count 
Due to the high unmet need for MF patients with a baseline platelet count <100 x 109/L, analyses 
were performed to evaluate spleen RR for the subgroups of subjects with a baseline platelet count 
<100 x 109/L versus ≥100 x 109/L. Subjects in both fedratinib arms showed a clinically meaningful 
spleen response compared with placebo, regardless of the baseline platelet count although in the 
fedratinib 400 mg arm, the rate was lower in patients with a baseline platelet count of <100x109/L 
versus ≥ 100x109/L (21.4% versus 39.0%). However, it must be noted that a minority of patients in 
each arm had a platelet count of <100x109/L, with respectively 18, 14 and 15 subjects in the placebo, 400 mg 
and 500 mg arms and the 95% confidence intervals of the response rates were wide and overlapping. 
Spleen Response Rate by other Baseline Subgroups of interest in relation to disease characteristics 
Myelofibrosis Risk Category and JAK2V617F Mutational Status: In the analyses evaluating spleen RR 
based on the baseline MF risk category and baseline JAK2V617F mutational status, a clinically 
meaningful spleen RR compared with placebo was also seen for subjects in both fedratinib arms. In the 
fedratinib 400 mg arm, for the baseline Intermediate-2 risk and high-risk MF categories the spleen RRs 
were 40.4% and 30.8% respectively and for JAK2V617F mutational profile being mutant or wild type, 
the spleen RRs were 40.3% and 30.0% respectively. For both of these subgroups, taking the 
differences in patient numbers per category and the overlapping 95% confidence intervals, these rates 
can be regarded as being similar. 
Myelofibrosis Subtype: For PMF (n=62), and Post PV MF (n=24), in the fedratinib 400 mg arm the 
Spleen RRs were practically the same at 33.9 and 37.5 respectively. Again, taking the differences in 
patient numbers per category and the overlapping 95% confidence intervals, these rates can be 
regarded as being similar. The Post ET MF subgroup (n=10) was too small to provide an estimate of 
the response rate which can be considered representative for Post ET MF patients.  
Male vs Female Subjects: In the fedratinib 400 mg arm, for male subjects the Spleen RR was 15/54 
(27.8%; 95% CI: 15.8, 39.7) and for females it was 20/42 (47.6%; 95% CI: 32.5, 62.7) with barely 
overlapping confidence intervals. 
This was not seen in the fedratinib 500 mg arm, in which the Spleen RR was 26/61 (42.6%; 95% CI: 
30.2, 55.0) in male subjects and in females it was 13/36 (36.1%; 95% CI: 20.4, 51.8). (For Spleen RR 
in male and female patients please be also referred to the subgroup analyses in study ARD 12181 
(JAKARTA2) where the rate (without LOCF) was also lower in males (13/53 (24.5%)) vs females 17/44 
(38.6%) but the difference was less and with more overlap in the 95% confidence intervals.) 
Note on subgroups transfusion dependence/independence  
For the subgroup of transfusion dependence/independence, the response rate in transfusion dependent 
patients was low (12.5%) in the 400 mg arm and high (60.0%) in the 500 mg arm. However, there 
were very few patients with transfusion dependence at baseline (n=14 for the fedratinib 400 mg vs 
placebo comparison and n=11 for the fedratinib 500 mg vs placebo comparison). Therefore, it is not 
possible to draw conclusions from this observation and it will not be pursued.

Results ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) / ARD12181 CSR Addendum 
Participant flow 
A total of 97 subjects were enrolled and treated in the study; of these 79 fulfilled the criteria of 
relapsed/refractory or intolerant based on post-hoc criteria (CSR Addendum cohort 1). Subject 
disposition is shown in Table 36 for the ITT population and cohort 1.   
When the development of fedratinib was terminated on 18 Nov 2013, all subjects worldwide were 
permanently discontinued from fedratinib treatment. At the time of study termination, 63 subjects 
were still receiving fedratinib and study termination was the main reason for permanent treatment 
discontinuation (64.9%) followed by adverse events (18.6%) and to a lesser extent disease 
progression (6.2%).  These frequencies were comparable for cohort 1 at 64.5%, 20.2% and 5.1% 
respectively and also for cohort 1a (Figure 20).  
Of the 79 subjects that met the newly-defined criteria for R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib treatment 
(Cohort 1), The criteria for Cohort 1a were met by 66 subjects and 13 subjects were excluded as they 
discontinued treatment prior to Cycle 6 due to termination of the study (Figure 20).

Recruitment 
Patients were recruited from forty active sites in Canada, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and the United States. Date first subject enrolled: 30 Apr 2012. 
Date last subject completed: 07 May 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
In the study, 4 subjects had important protocol deviations, all of which were related to the subjects not 
meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Protocol deviations were medically reviewed prior to database lock 
leading to no subjects being excluded from the efficacy analyses, as it was considered that none would 
affect the interpretation of results.  
Baseline data 
Demographic Characteristics 
The ITT population consisted of 54.6% men and 45.4% women; subjects were mostly white (94.8%) 
and had a median age 67.0 years (Table 37). The proportion of subjects who were ≤65 years of age 
was 42.3% and 13.4% was older than 75 years Results were comparable between the ITT population 
and chort1 and cohort 1a.

a  Cohort 1 is a subset of the total population of the study based on the new definitions of R/R and intolerant to 
ruxolitinib that Celgene-Impact applied. Cohort 1a is a subset of Cohort 1 and includes subjects who either had 
the opportunity to receive a minimum of 6 cycles of fedratinib treatment or discontinued study treatment prior to 
Cycle 6 due to any reason other than the clinical hold/global termination of the programme. 
Note: The denominator for percentages is the number of subjects in the ITT Population. 
Baseline Myelofibrosis Disease Characteristics 
Baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 38. In the overall ITT population (n=97), the 
largest proportion of subjects (54.6%) had PMF, followed by post-PV MF (25.8%) and post-ET MF 
(19.6%). The median time since diagnosis of MF was 4.0 years. The most frequent MF risk categories 
by the IPSS or the DIPSS were intermediate-2 risk (48.5%) and high risk (35.1%); 16.5% was 
intermediate- 1 risk with symptoms. Almost all subjects (95.9%) had constitutional symptoms (night 
sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, early satiety, or bone pain) prior to starting 
treatment with fedratinib. Most subjects had an ECOG PS of 0 (26.8%) or 1 (46.4%) and about 15% 
were RBC-transfusion dependent.  Approximately 60% of subjects had a mutant JAK2. The median 
spleen volume at baseline was 2893.50 mL (range: 737.0 to 7815.0 mL), which is approximately 14 
times the median normal spleen volume of about 215 mL (Prassopoulos, 1997). The median spleen 
size at baseline was 18.0 cm (range: 5.0 to 36.0 cm). Disease characteristics at baseline for subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 1a were comparable to that of the overall ITT population.

a  Cohort 1 includes subjects meeting newly defined criteria for relapsed/refractory or intolerant to ruxolitinib. 
Cohort 1a is a subgroup of Cohort 1 that includes subjects who initiated Cycle 6 of fedratinib treatment or who 
had discontinued fedratinib treatment for reasons other than “study terminated by sponsor.” 
c  A subject had constitutional symptoms if any of the symptoms in the baseline MPN-SAF (night sweats, itching, 
abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, early satiety, bone pain) had a value greater than zero. 
Prior Anticancer Treatments 
The majority (79.4%) of subjects had received ≥2 prior anticancer therapies, and 13.4% of subjects 
had received ≥4 prior anticancer therapies. Per protocol, all 97 subjects enrolled in the study had 
received prior treatment with ruxolitinib. Besides ruxolitinib, the most common anticancer therapy was 
hydroxycarbamide, which was received by 68.0% of subjects.

Prior Treatment with Ruxolitinib and Subjects Resistant or Intolerant as per Investigator’s 
Assessment 
The initial daily dose of ruxolitinib which subjects had received was 30 mg or 40 mg (currently 
approved initial dose for Jakavi) in 71.1% (69/97) of the subjects and 20 mg in 18.6% (18/97). The 
median duration of exposure to ruxolitinib prior to enrollment was 10.68 months and exposure ranged 
from 1.0 to 62.4 months. Subjects were classified as resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib as per 
investigators’ assessment and of the 97 subjects enrolled and treated, 64 (66.0%) subjects were 
classified as resistant to ruxolitinib, 32 (33.0%) subjects were classified as intolerant and one subject 
was categorised as “Other: Lack of efficacy”. However, as mentioned above under “Patient 
Disposition”, 79 subjects fulfilled the criteria of relapsed/refractory or intolerant based on post-hoc 
criteria applied by MF experts and formed Cohort 1.   
Numbers analysed 
The analysis populations are described in the Section Statistical Methods and the numbers of patients 
per analysis population are shown in Table 39. 
Of the 97 enrolled subjects, 14 were excluded from the PP Population because they either missed the 
baseline MRI/CT scan assessment of spleen volume or did not have a post-baseline assessment of 
spleen volume. There were 90 (92.8%) subjects in the MFSAF Analysis Population, and 90 (92.8%) in 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 Analysis Population. These proportions were the same in cohort1 and cohort 1a. 
All 97 subjects enrolled were included in the PK Population. 
The Thiamine Supplementation Follow-up Population included 81 (83.5%) subjects, of whom 65 
subjects were adequately followed up. Sixteen subjects were not part of this population because they 
either died prior to the Thiamine Supplementation Period (11 subjects) or did not choose to take 
thiamine and refused follow-up (5 subjects).

Outcomes and estimation 
Spleen Response Rate 
The pre-defined primary endpoint spleen RR used the LOCF method performed for the Per-protocol 
Population (n=83). The proportion of the 83 evaluable subjects in the PP Population who had a spleen 
response (≥ 35% spleen volume reduction (SVR)) was 48.2% (95% CI: 37.1% to 59.4%). The lower

limit of the 95% CI for the spleen RR was above 10%, which was used in defining a null hypothesis of 
≤10% RR for determining the sample size by the original Sponsor of the product. 
To confirm the robustness of the results, Celgene-Impact conducted 3 additional supportive analyses 
which yielded the following spleen RRs (95% CI), in line with results of the primary analysis: PP 
Population without LOCF: 
36.1% (25.9, 47.4) [30/83] 
ITT Population with LOCF: 
41.2% (31.3, 51.7) [40/97] 
ITT Population without LOCF:  30.9 (21.9, 41.1) [30/97] 
The spleen RRs for the Overall ITT Population with and without LOCF, for Cohort 1 ITT without LOCF 
and for Cohort 1a ITT without LOCF are shown in Table 40. For cohort 1, the results were comparable 
to that of the overall ITT population without LOCF.

Note: Spleen volume was measured by MRI/CT and reviewed in a blinded fashion by a central imaging laboratory.  
Given the single arm design and the additional uncertainty from missing data due to early study 
termination by the original sponsor, the most conservative approach is the one based on the ITT 
without LOCF (i.e. missing for whatever reason is considered a non-response). This also supported by 
the substantially lower point estimate (30.9% vs 48.2%). Therefore, the results of the ITT without 
LOCF are considered most relevant in this report.  
Analyses by Maximum Fedratinib Dose Administered 
In study ARD12182, up-titration to 500 mg or 600 mg was allowed if predefined efficacy and safety 
criteria were met (within the first 6 cycles of the treatment, if the subject’s spleen response did not 
achieve a ≥50% reduction in spleen size by palpation and there was no unacceptable drug toxicity). Of 
the 97 enrolled subjects, the majority (n = 64; 66.0%) did not have dose up-titration and 33 (34%) 
had a dose up-titration; 17 (17.5%) received a maximum dose of 500 mg once daily; 15 (15.5%) 
received a maximum dose of 600 mg QD; and 1 subject received a maximum dose of 800 mg/day, 
which was noted as a protocol deviation (this subject is analysed with the subjects who received a 
maximum dose of 600 mg once daily). 
The spleen volume response of subjects who had a dose up-titration are summarised below. 
17 subjects received a maximum dose of 500 mg/day. Of these, 1 subject did not have an End-of-
Cycle 3 assessment: 
•  10/17 subjects had the dose up-titrated, but never achieved a ≥35% SVR; furthermore, 5 out of 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 101/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 10 subjects needed a dose reduction to 400 mg/day or lower due to toxicity. 
•  3/17 subjects already had a ≥ 35% SVR at a dose of 400 mg/day, before the dose up-titration 
to 500 mg/day occurred. 
•  4/17 subjects achieved a ≥ 35% SVR after the dose up-titration; however, 2 of the 4 subjects 
needed a dose reduction to 400 mg/day due to toxicity. 
15 subjects received a maximum dose of 600 mg/day. One subject is also mentioned here who took 
800 mg/day (on Cycle 4 Day 8 only) instead of the intended 400 mg/day: 
•  9/16 subjects had the dose up-titrated, but never achieved a ≥ 35% SVR; furthermore, 6 out of 
the 9 subjects needed a dose reduction to 400 mg/day due to toxicity. 
•  1/16 subjects already had a ≥ 35% SVR before the dose up-titration to 800 mg/day occurred. 
•  6/16 patients achieved a ≥ 35% SVR after the dose up-titration; however, 5 of the 6 subjects 
needed a dose reduction to 400 mg/day due to toxicity. 
Thus 4/17 patients who received up-titration to a maximum of 500 mg/day and 6/16 patients who 
were up-titrated to a maximum of 600 mg/day achieved a ≥35% SVR after the dose up-titration. 
However, 7 of these 10 patients who had achieved a ≥35% SVR after the dose up-titration needed a 
dose reduction to 400 mg/day due to toxicity. The applicant concludes that for these 10 patients it is 
difficult to determine if dose up-titration may have provided any additional clinical benefit. 
Most of the other patients did not achieve a ≥35% SVR and at least half of those patients needed a 
dose reduction due to toxicity and 3 of 17 patients who had up-titrated to 500 mg had achieved a 
≥35% SVR before the dose increase. 
As the patients who responded only after dose up-titration are also counted in the total number of 
responders in study ARD12181, there may be an overestimation of the spleen RR observed with a dose 
of 400 mg in the population studied. In response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant provided an analysis 
of spleen RR in the ITT Population without LOCF, counting patients who only achieved a response after 
dose increase above 400 mg as non-responders. The Spleen Response rate (without LOCF) for patients 
who received only 400 mg, thus counting 8 subjects with dose up-titration as non responders, was 
lower at 22/97 (22.7%; 14.8, 32.3) compared to 30/97 (30.9%; 21.9, 41.1) for those who had dose 
up-titration.  
Percentage Change in spleen volume End of Cycle 6Change in spleen volume from baseline to 
end of Cycle 6 was analysed for the subjects with available baseline and end of Cycle 6 assessments. 
Median percent changes in spleen volume were as follows: 
Per-protocol Population with LOCF: 
−34.0% at End of Cycle 6 (n=82; 95% CI: −36.0%, −24.8%; range: −73% to 115%). 
Among the evaluable subjects for percent change in spleen volume at End of Cycle 6, the majority 
(77/82) of subjects had some degree of reduction in spleen volume when using the LOCF method.  
Per-protocol Population without LOCF: 
-38.0% at End of Cycle 6 (n=51; 95% CI: −41.9%, −26.9%; range: −73% to 115%). 
Among the evaluable subjects for percent change in spleen volume at End of Cycle 6, all but one 
subject had some degree of reduction in spleen volume (50/51) Figure 21. 
ITT Population without LOCF: The median percent change of spleen volume was -38.0% at End of 
Cycle 6 (n=51; 95% CI: -41.9, -26.9; range: −73% to 115%).

Note: The 51 (of 83) subjects who had both baseline and EOC6 spleen volume assessments were the 
same subjects in the ITT population (without LOCF) and the PP Population (without LOCF), which 
explains the identical results for the percent change in spleen volume at End of Cycle 6 (EOC6) in 
these 2 populations. 
Cohort 1 (ITT Population without LOCF): 
Among the 41 evaluable subjects for percent reduction in spleen volume, all subjects had some degree 
of reduction in spleen volume in both Cohorts 1 (Figure 22) and 1a (figure the same and not shown).

Secondary Efficacy endpoints 
Symptom Response Rate using the modified MFSAF (Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment 
Form) 
The 6 key MF-associated symptoms were assessed using the modified MFSAF and measured on a scale 
from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable, TSS=60), thus reduction in TSS suggests improvement in 
symptom burden. Most (42/51) subjects in the MFSAF evaluable population with a TSS at End of Cycle 
6 had a decrease in the modified MFSAF TSS at End of Cycle 6 (Figure 23). 
The proportion of subjects with a ≥50% reduction in the TSS at End of Cycle 6 (the secondary 
endpoint Symptom RR) was 26.7% (Table 41). The proportion of subjects in the MFSAF Analysis 
Population achieving a ≥50% reduction in the TSS 31.1% at End of Cycle 3. 
In the subset of subjects who were R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib (Cohorts 1 and 1a, post-hoc 
analysis), symptom response rate was 27.0% and 32.3% respectively at the end of Cycle 6. 
As for spleen RR, in response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant provided an analysis of response rate in 
the ITT Population, counting patients who only achieved a response after dose increase above 400 mg 
as non-responders. The Symptom Response rate  for patients who received only 400 mg, thus 
counting 4 subjects with dose up-titration as non-responders, was lower at 20/93 (21.5%; 13.7, 31.2) 
for patients who received only 400 mg with 4 subjects considered non responders compared 24/90 
(26.7%; 17.9, 37) for those who had dose up-titration. 
As for Study EFC12153, since the requirement to have all of the symptoms scores for each day, and to 
have symptom scores from 5/7 days to calculate the weekly score requires high compliance. In 
Assessment report

response to D120 LoQ the applicant provided data on excluded symptom evaluations, demonstrating 
that symptom responses were similar also when all available symptom scores were included in the 
analyses.

Median Percent Change in Total Symptom Score 
The median percent change in TSS decreased over time, and the greatest reduction in TSS from 
baseline was observed at End of Cycle 6. For the 51 subjects in the MFSAF evaluable population with a 
TSS at End of Cycle 6, the median percent change was −44.33%. 
All key symptoms assessed showed an improvement at End of Cycle 6 in half of the evaluable subjects, 
with median percent changes of: 
•  −83.33% in pain under ribs on left side 
•  −75.95% in night sweats 
•  −51.30% in early satiety 
•  −46.18% in abdominal discomfort 
•  −44.12% in pruritus 
•  −22.22% in bone or muscle pain 
Spleen Response Rate at End of Cycle 3 
In the overall ITT Population, the proportion of subjects with a ≥35% spleen volume reduction (SVR) 
at End of Cycle 3 was 40.2% (39/97 subjects).  Comparable results were seen for Cohort 1 and 1a.

Duration of Spleen Response 
For the duration of response analysis, responders were all subjects who at any time during treatment 
achieved a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline. The duration of spleen response was 
calculated from the first date of spleen response (i.e., ≥ 35% SVR from baseline) to the date of 
disease progression (i.e., ≥ 25% spleen volume increase from baseline) or death, whichever was 
earlier.  
During the study, 2 responders had progressed or died prior to clinical hold. 
The vast majority of responders, 45/47 subjects overall and 39/41 subjects in Cohort 1, were on 
treatment at the time of the clinical hold and the duration of response analysis was subject to 
extensive censoring.  
Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 25% of patients had a duration of response of ≤ 9.4 months, the 
median duration was not estimable.  
Effect of fedratinib on the JAK2V617F allele burden and on bone marrow parameters 
There were insufficient data to make statistically robust conclusions on changes in JAK2V617F allele 
burden and bone marrow parameters during treatment. Data for both baseline and additional cycles of 
Assessment report

treatment were collected from only 15 subjects for evaluation of effects on JAK2V617F allele burden and 
from only 13 subjects for bone marrow response assessment. 
Exploratory Endpoint: Health-related Quality of Life 
The EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 Analysis 
Population was used for the analysis of health-related QoL (HRQOL). 
As one of the exploratory endpoints, scores in the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-
C30), which is a cancer-specific instrument, were assessed at baseline and compared to those at the 
End of Cycle 6. 
A high score for a functional scale or global health status/QoL represents a high/healthy level of 
functioning or a high QoL.   
In half of the evaluable subjects, there was a post-baseline improvement at EOC6 for the following 
EORTC QLQ-C30 domains: global QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, pain, insomnia, and appetite loss. 
For all the other functional and symptom domains, level of QoL was overall maintained over the 6-
cycle treatment period.  
Ancillary analyses 
The consistency of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint was further evaluated in subgroups 
defined according to clinically relevant demographic factors and baseline disease/prognosis 
characteristics. Regardless of the subgroups analysed fedratinib consistently showed clinical benefit in 
terms of spleen RR (≥ 35% SVR) at the end of Cycle 6 within the subsets of each subgroup and over 
the subgroups in the overall ITT population and in Cohort 1 (Table 43). In the various subgroups in 
Cohort 1a, the Spleen RRs were very similar to those in Cohort 1. 
Spleen Response Rate by Baseline Platelet Count 
Due to the limited number of treatment options for patients with MF and low platelet counts, spleen RR 
by baseline platelet count was also analysed. Irrespective of the baseline platelet count (< 100 x 
109/L: Spleen RR 12/33 (36.4%) or ≥ 100 x 109/L: Spleen RR 18/64 (28.1%) ), fedratinib showed 
clinical benefit for subjects in the ITT Population in terms of spleen RR (Table 43). The Spleen RR in 
patients with baseline platelet count < 100 x 109/L was 12/33 (36.4%) and in patients with baseline 
platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L it was 18/64 (28.1%) and 95% confidence intervals for the rate were 
widely overlapping. 
Spleen Response Rate by other Baseline Subgroups of interest in relation to disease characteristics 
Myelofibrosis Risk Category and JAK2V617F Mutational Status: In the analyses evaluating spleen RR 
based on the baseline MF risk category and baseline JAK2V617F mutational status, a clinically 
meaningful spleen RR was seen in all subgroups. 
For the baseline Intermediate risk and high-risk MF categories the spleen RRs were similar at 21/63 
(33.3%) and 9/34 (26.5%) respectively with the same 95% confidence intervals. 
For JAK2V617F mutational profile being mutant or wild type, the spleen RR was lower in the patients 
with wild type mutational profile being 5/29 (17.2%; 95% CI 3.5, 31.0) compared to 23/61 (37.7%; 
95% CI 25.5, 49.9) in patients with the mutation, with 95% CIs which did not overlap. This is in 
contrast to study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) where this difference was not seen, although due to small 
patient numbers firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 107/170 
 
 
 
 
 
Myelofibrosis Subtype 
For PMF (n=53), and Post PV MF (n=25) and Post ET MF (n=19) the Spleen RRs were 28.3%, 44.0% 
and 21.1% respectively. Although the rate was lower in patients with Post ET MF, taking the 
differences in patient numbers per category and the 95% confidence intervals, which overlap but less 
so in the case of Post ET MF, it cannot be concluded that there is evidence of major differences in the 
Spleen RR between the three myelofibrosis subtypes. 
Male vs Female Subjects 
For male subjects the Spleen RR (without LOCF) was 13/53 (24.5%; 95% CI 12.9, 36.1) and for 
females it was 17/44 (38.6%; 95% CI 24.2, 53.0) with barely overlapping confidence intervals. 
(For Spleen RR in male and female patients please be also referred to the subgroup analyses in study 
EFC12153 (JAKARTA) where the rate was also lower in males vs females but with a larger difference 
(27.8% vs 47.6%)).

Subgroup analyses by the subgroups ruxolitinib R/R vs intolerant  
Analyses were performed on subjects enrolled in the study and determined to be relapsed/refractory 
(R/R) or intolerant to ruxolitinib based on criteria recommended by MF experts from the US and EU  
Spleen RR were 30.8% (20/65 subjects) for subjects R/R to ruxolitinib and 28.6% (4/14) for subjects 
intolerant to ruxolitinib in Cohort 1; in Cohort 1a, the spleen RRs were 35.7% (20/56) and 40.0% 
(4/10), respectively (Table 44).  
Spleen RRs are consistent with the overall ITT study population (N = 97), although the number of 
ruxolitinib intolerant patients is too low to make conclusions about this subgroup.

Efficacy Data following discontinuation 
In study EFC12153, as mentioned under “Disposition of Subjects” at the time of study termination, all 
subjects had either completed the first 6 cycles or had previously permanently discontinued treatment.  
Before EOC6: The numbers of patients who discontinued treatment permanently before end of Cycle 6 
(EOC6) were 24, 21 and 31 patients in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg arms respectively. Among 
those who discontinued before EOC6, the most frequent reason was adverse event at 33.3%, 16.9% 
and 77.4% in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg arms respectively. For discontinuation due to PD, 
16.7% discontinued in placebo arm and one patient in each of the fedratinib arms. 
After EOC6: The most common reason for discontinuation after EOC6 was study termination by Sanofi 
at 68% of patients from the fedratinib arms who were continuing to receive fedratinib (51/75 from the 
400 mg arm and 45/66 from the 500 mg arm (applicant response to LoQ) and 68% (49/71) of patients 
who had crossed from placebo to fedratinib (placebo number from EFC12153 CSR). 
According to the EFC12153 study protocol, spleen size by palpation, ECOG Performance status and 
safety assessments were to be performed following permanent fedratinib treatment discontinuation. 
The applicant provided information (post-hoc in response to Q129 in D120 LoQ) on spleen size/volume 
and symptom score (TSS) (also on safety) in patients who permanently discontinued before EOC6 and 
in patients who permanently discontinued after EOC6. The aim was to gain more insight into the 
further course of the disease after treatment discontinuation. 
Spleen volume reduction after treatment discontinuation 
Very limited data were available on spleen volume reduction after treatment discontinuation. One of 
the subjects (from the fedratinib 500 mg arm) who discontinued before EOC6 had a ≥ 35% spleen 
volume reduction at EOT.  
Considering only patients from the fedratinib arms, with available spleen volume assessments, of 
the 41 subjects who permanently discontinued treatment after the EOC6, 14.3% (3/21) of subjects in 
the 400 mg arm and 20.0% (4/20) in the 500 mg arm had a ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction at EOT. 
Change in Spleen Size after treatment discontinuation  
For subjects in the All Treated Population who permanently discontinued treatment before the EOC6, 
the mean percentage change in spleen size (by palpation) at the EOT for subjects with baseline 
assessments was -5.8% in the placebo arm, -12.1% in the 400 mg arm, and -21.8% in the 500 mg 
arm. 
Considering only patients from the fedratinib arms, for subjects who permanently discontinued 
treatment after the EOC6, the mean percentage change in spleen size at the EOT for subjects with 
baseline assessments was -45.0% in the 400 mg arm (assessment in 67 of 75 subjects) and -54.3% in 
the 500 mg arm (assessment in 52 of 66 subjects). 
It can be noted that the EOT (End of Treatment) was to be performed at least 30 days following last 
administration of fedratinib or placebo. 
Spleen response Per Modified IWG-MRT Criteria 
Best response (spleen size reduction [by palpation]) after permanent treatment discontinuation based 
on all available spleen size assessments was assessed in all patients who had received fedratinib using 
the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria. 
Patients originally in the placebo arm, who received treatment with fedratinib, consisted of those who 
had progressive disease before EOC6 (n=10) and those who crossed over at EOC6 (n=61). These, 
added to the 96 patients in the fedratinib 400 mg arm and 97 in the 500 mg arm, account for the total 
number of 264 patients who had received treatment with fedratinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 111/170 
 
 
 
 
For 152 of these 264 subjects, a spleen assessment was available, 84 subjects treated with fedratinib 
400 mg and 68 subjects treated with fedratinib 500 mg.  
[Spleen response Per Modified IWG-MRT Criteria: a baseline splenomegaly that was palpable at 5 to 10 
cm, below the LCM, became not palpable; or a baseline splenomegaly that was palpable at > 10 cm, 
below the LCM, decreased by ≥ 50%. A baseline splenomegaly that was palpable at < 5 cm, below the 
LCM (left costal margin), was not eligible for spleen response. 
Stable disease: a response not belonging to the spleen response or PD response categories.] 
It is understood that for this assessment of Spleen response Per Modified IWG-MRT Criteria, baseline 
assessment refers to an assessment prior to or at the EOT. 
Regardless of subsequent anticancer therapy, 79.6% (121/152) of subjects who had available spleen 
size assessments had a best response of stable disease after permanent treatment discontinuation.  
The RR (spleen size reduction of 50%) was 2.6% (4/152) and the rate of PD was 17.8% (27/152) 
Note that subjects who crossed over to fedratinib from placebo are counted in the corresponding 400 
or 500 mg fedratinib arm. 
Among subjects who received further anticancer therapy after permanent treatment discontinuation, 
the rate of stable disease was 73% (54/74) over both arms, the RR was 4.1% (3/74) and the rate of 
PD was 23.0% (17/74) 
Among subjects who did not receive further anticancer therapy after permanent treatment 
discontinuation, the rate of stable disease was 85.9% (67/78) over both arms, only one subject (500 
mg arm) had a response and the rate of PD was12.8% (10/78) 
According to the study design, the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) was not 
completed after the EOC6 thus no relevant data on TSS are available. 
Efficacy Data in Subjects Who Received Ruxolitinib or Hydroxyurea After Permanently Discontinuing 
Fedratinib  
Per protocol, in Study EFC12153 subjects were followed for survival, progression (as assessed by 
spleen size), and further anticancer therapy every 3 months from the date of treatment discontinuation 
until death. Additionally, for subjects who had previously discontinued fedratinib, spleen size by 
palpation was also assessed at a Follow-up visit (14 to 33 days after thiamine supplementation) during 
the Thiamine Supplementation Period. The planned follow-up for survival and IWG-MRT assessment of 
clinical response did not occur after the clinical hold/study termination. 
In response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant has provided information showing that, after 
discontinuation the proportions of subjects (ITT population) who received ruxolitinib (62/289 (21.5%)) 
or hydroxyurea (56/289 (19.4%)) as further anticancer therapy were similar. In the 145 subjects with 
permanent treatment discontinuation due to early study termination by Sanofi, and the 144 subjects 
without early study termination (further treatment in these latter cases was considered as second line 
therapy), the proportions of subjects who received ruxolitinib were approximately the same at 22.1 % 
and 20.8% respectively. The proportions of subjects who received hydroxyurea were fairly similar at 
15.2% and 23.6% respectively. 
Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response per Modified IWG-MRT Criteria 
Information regarding the investigator IWG-MRT assessment of efficacy was available for 15 subjects 
who received ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea after permanently discontinuing fedratinib 400 mg or 500 mg. 
13 of these subjects were fedratinib-treated, including 4 subjects who received fedratinib after 
crossover from placebo. From the short narratives provided, among the 13 fedratinib treated subjects, 
4 had received ruxolitinib and 9 had received hydroxyurea. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 112/170 
 
 
 
 
The best response after subsequent therapy with ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea was PR for 1 subject 
(ruxolitinib treated), stable disease for 8 subjects, and PD for 4 subjects (all treated with 
hydroxyurea). The duration of treatment with ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea was not reported in most 
cases and varied considerably e.g. from several days to almost one year, in the rest. 
Applicant’s Assessment of Best Response in Spleen Size Reduction Per Modified IWG-MRT Criteria 
Data were available for applying the IWG-MRT criteria to assess best response (spleen size reduction) 
after initiation of follow-up therapy with ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea, for 41 subjects who had received 
treatment with fedratinib (23/52 subjects who had received fedratinib 400 mg and 18/47 who had 
received fedratinib 500 mg). These 41 subjects included 7 of the 9 subjects who had crossed over from 
placebo to fedratinib 400 mg or 500 mg. 
Best spleen response (spleen size was measured by palpation) was evaluated per the modified IWG-
MRT criteria (Tefferi, 2013 - see above for definitions of response and stable disease). 
The response rates were:  Response  14.6% (6/41); Stable disease 80.5% (33/41); PD 4.9% (2/41). 
No information is given on the duration of treatment with ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea. 
Analysis of survival after initiation of ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea was not performed due to the very 
limited numbers of subjects who died. Altogether 13 subjects died after receiving ruxolitinib (N = 2) or 
hydroxyurea (N = 12 (one subject received both ruxolitinib and hydroxyurea)) as follow-up anticancer 
therapy. Eleven patients who had been treated with fedratinib died, 10 of whom had received 
hydroxyurea and one had received ruxolitinib.

Within the fedratinib arms, 21 and 31 patients discontinued treatment before 
EOC6 in the 400 mg and 500 mg group, respectively, mostly due to adverse 
events (400 mg: n=13, 500 mg: n=24). Over the entire treatment duration, 
most patients discontinued due to early study termination (400m: n=61, 500 
mg: n=52) and due to adverse events (400 mg: n=26, 500 mg: n=35). Study 
discontinuation due to disease progression was observed in 6 and 3 patients in 
the 400 mg and 500 mg group, respectively.    
Placebo group: All patients discontinued at EOC6 in line with protocol, and 
n=24 before EOC6. Main reasons are adverse events (n=8), consent withdrawn 
(n=5) and disease progression or subject request (both n=4).

Study EFC12153 
The proportions of subjects with ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction (SVR) at the EOC6 confirmed 4 
weeks later were 27.6% (8/29) in the 400 mg arm and 46.5% (20/43) in the 500 mg arm compared 
with 0% (0/44) in the placebo arm. The proportions of subjects with ≥ 35% at the EOC6 were 41.4% 
(12/29) in the 400 mg arm and 55.8% (24/43) in the 500 mg arm compared with 0% (0/44) in the 
placebo arm. For both analyses, the active treatment arms showed clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant differences compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.0002). 
In the smaller subgroup of subjects 75 to 84 years (N = 31), a benefit in spleen RR at the EOC6 was 
observed in favor of fedratinib over placebo for both doses (400 and 500 mg) but the differences were 
not statistically significant. The proportions of subjects with ≥ 35% SVR at the EOC6 confirmed 4 
weeks later were 33.3% (3/9) in the 400 mg arm and 33.3% (4/12) in the 500 mg arm compared 
with 10.0% (1/10) in the placebo arm. The proportions of subjects with ≥ 35% SVR at the EOC6 were 
44.4% (4/9) in the 400 mg arm and 33.3% (4/12) in the 500 mg arm compared with 10.0% (1/10) in 
the placebo arm.

Supportive study(ies) 
The possibility to predict the time course of spleen volume in patients using fedratinib after ruxolitinib 
in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) based on the time course observed in the ruxolitinib-naïve patients in 
the 400 mg arm of EFC12153 (JAKARTA) was investigated on request of the Medicines Evaluation 
Board. Visually, the time profiles of those patients in ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) with follow-up available 
beyond end of cycle 3 are similar to that patients in EFC12153 (JAKARTA). Prediction of a future value 
of a JAKARTA-2 patient was based on either a) all JAKARTA and JAKARTA-2 data, b) all JAKARTA data 
and the history of the JAKARTA-2 patients up to the point to predict, c) only the JAKARTA data. The fit 
and prediction accuracy of all models was reasonably to well, and all models showed on average a 
further reduction in spleen volume. By construction, these predictions are for patients that stay on 
treatment.  
On request of the applicant, an external outcome research consultancy company performed a 
systematic literature review of all studies with treatments applied after ruxolitinib. Subsequently an 
indirect comparison was conducted of fedratinib after ruxolitinib versus best supportive care after 
ruxolinitib. The search and modeling were performed adequately. Only three studies could be used for 
indirect treatment comparison (JAKARTA-2: 97 patients, SIMPLIFY-2: 52, PERSIST-2: 72). Best 
available (BAT) therapy was mostly ruxolitinib (SIMPLIFY-2: 89%, PERSIST-2: 45%). The comparisons 
were conducted with matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) and simulated treatment 
comparison methodology. These suggested that fedratinib could have a potential clinical benefit 
superior to best available care after ruxolitinib in terms of spleen RR and total symptom score. 
However, several limitations are present including: lack of a common comparator (JAKARTA-2 is a 
single arm trial); the strong assumptions that every prognostic variable and every treatment effect 
modifier that is imbalanced between JAKARTA-2 and one of the other studies as to be available; 
in/exclusion criteria and outcome measurement are not fully comparable between studies. In 
particular, PERSIST-2 included both ruxolitinib naive patients and ruxolitinib pretreated patients and 
outcomes of these could not be separated.   
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The claimed indication for Inrebic in the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis is as follows: 
Inrebic is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis who are JAK inhibitor naïve or who have been treated with ruxolitinib.

EMA/705612/2020  
Page 119/170 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study Design 
In order to support the claimed indication, the applicant has submitted 2 pivotal studies: 
●  EFC12153 (JAKARTA) to support an indication in JAK inhibitor naïve patients  
●  ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) to support an indication in patients who have been treated with 
ruxolitinib. 
For study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) the applicant also submitted a CSR Addendum (see below under 
Study conduct, analysis and reporting of results), which covers only a sub-population (Cohort 1, n=79) 
of the total study population (n=97). Cohort 1 consisted of all subjects enrolled in the study who met 
the post-hoc expert criteria for either R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib. 
EFC12153 (JAKARTA) was a randomised, controlled trial with 3 arms, in which the efficacy and safety 
of 2 doses of fedratinib (400 mg and 500 mg) were compared to placebo.  
Comparison against placebo provides a measure of absolute efficacy for this new drug and in this 
regard this placebo-controlled study is suitable and of value. However, fedratinib is not the first of its 
kind in this class since the JAK kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi approved in the US in November 
2011; Jakavi, approved in the EU in August 2012) has become standard of care in patients with 
primary myelofibrosis (PMF) who have PMF related symptoms or who develop splenomegaly or PMF 
related symptoms while on other treatment. Nevertheless, it can be taken into consideration that study 
EFC12153 (JAKARTA) was designed and initiated (first patient enrolled in December 2011) before 
ruxolitinib was widely available or approved in the EU. 
The applicant’s justification for the design of study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) (first patient enrolled in 
April 2012) as an open-label, single-arm trial is that the study investigated fedratinib in a population 
with an unmet medical need, such as subjects who have failed treatment with ruxolitinib and have no 
other options. It can be argued that a comparator arm offering best treatment options available at that 
time could have been used. Indeed, the applicant has recently initiated a Phase 3 open-label, RCT 
(FEDR-MF-002, NCT03952039) in this population with current best available therapy as comparator. 
As study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) did not have a comparator arm, for assessing the relevance of the 
data in relation to treatments which might otherwise have been given, one has to rely on external 
control data with the limitations of such a comparison. However, the uncertainty which this brings is 
alleviated by the fact that fedratinib showed a large effect in the placebo-controlled trial and the 
disease myelofibrosis does not show spontaneous remission. 
Patient population - inclusion requirements  
Both pivotal studies included only adults and with regard to patient and disease characteristics, the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar in these studies with the important exception that in study 
EFC12153 (JAKARTA) patients had not previously been treated with a JAK inhibitor whereas in study 
ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) only patients who had previously been exposed to ruxolitinib were included. 
Principal inclusion requirements of relevance to the expected benefits and proposed indication were 
almost the same in both trials i.e. MF classified as high-risk or intermediate-risk level 2, as defined by 
modified IWG-MRT criteria (which include constitutional symptoms) at screening and with an enlarged 
spleen, palpable ≥5 cm below the costal margin. In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), patients with MF 
classified as intermediate-1 with symptoms and with splenomegaly ≥5 cm below the costal margin 
could also be included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 120/170 
 
 
 
In both studies, presence of mutations in JAK2 was not required for inclusion which is understood as 
the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has been found to have efficacy in reduction of spleen volume and MF 
symptoms regardless of the presence or not of the JAK2V617F mutation. 
Patient population patients included 
In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) the overall frequency of subjects with intermediate-2 or high-risk status 
was 51.9% and 48.1%, respectively, and in the 400 mg arm (the dose also used in ARD12181 
(JAKARTA2)) these frequencies were 59.4% and 40.6% respectively. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) the most frequent MF risk categories by the IPSS or the DIPSS were 
intermediate-2 risk (48.5%) and high risk (35.1%), while intermediate- 1 risk with symptoms (16.5%) 
was less frequent. 
Fairly similar proportions of patients with intermediate risk and high risk patients were thus included in 
study EFC12153 (JAKARTA), in particular in the 400 mg arm, and in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2). 
Although study ARD12181 included a small proportion of Intermediate-1 risk patients (16 of 97 
patients), inclusion of these patients with a lower risk category is considered acceptable as they also 
had to fulfil the same inclusion criteria of spleen ≥5 cm below costal margin by palpation and presence 
of MF symptoms as the Intermediate-2 risk patients in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA), criteria which are 
relevant to the claimed therapeutic value of this JAK2 inhibitor. Additionally, in study ARD12181 
patients were required to be resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib as per investigators’ assessment.   
In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) the largest proportion of subjects in the ITT Population had PMF 
(63.3%), followed by post-PV MF (26.3%) and post-ET MF (10.4%). 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) these distributions were quite similar with most subjects (54.6%) 
having a diagnosis of PMF, followed by post-PV MF (25.8%) and post-ET MF (19.6%). 
These proportions are very similar to those investigated in the ruxolitinib pivotal studies in which 
patients with PMF, post-PV MF and post-ET MF represented approximately 50%, 30% and 20% 
respectively of the population (Jakavi EPAR). 
Dose justification and doses used 
With respect to exposure-efficacy relationships, significant relationships were established between the 
cumulative AUC from cycle 1 to cycle 6 (AUCC1-C6) and percent change in spleen volume at the end of 
cycle 6, spleen volume response rate (RR, percentage of patients with >35% reduction at the end of 
cycle 6), and total symptom score response (TSSR). In general, the increase in effect on these efficacy 
parameters going from the 400 to the 500 mg dose was found to be limited which may be attributable 
to the dose reductions and dose interruptions, resulting in significantly overlapping cumulative AUCC1-
C6 for the 400 mg and 500 mg dose cohorts. 
In Study TED12037, doses from 30 mg to 800 mg per day in consecutive 28-day cycles were tested 
and 680 mg/day was determined to be the MTD. 
Study ARD11936 further evaluated the doses of 300 mg, 400 mg and 500 mg QD and generated 
additional PK and PD data. In that study, spleen RR (defined as ≥35% SVR at End of Cycle 6) was 
60.0% and 63.6% in the 400 mg and 500 mg group respectively, compared to 30% in the 300 mg 
group. Symptom response rates of ≥50% reduction in TTS at End of Cycle 6 were 33.3% in the 300 
mg group, 60.0% in the 400 mg group, and 37.5% in the 500 mg group.  
In Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) there was a trend for better spleen and symptom response in the 500 
mg arm than in the 400 mg arm. However, with the 400 mg dose, Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs including Grade 
3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and TEAEs leading to dose interruption or dose reduction or to permanent 
treatment discontinuation were less frequent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 121/170 
 
 
 
Overall, the findings supported the investigation of the 400 mg/day and 500 mg day doses in the 
pivotal studies and subsequently the choice of 400 mg/day as the dose proposed for approval. Dose 
titration has not been studied in JAK inhibitor naïve patients, apart from allowing dose up-titration in 
the dose escalation study, and in the 300mg group in the dose ranging study. Dose up-titration up to 
600mg/day was allowed based on response in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), as it was hypothesised 
that higher doses may be required in ruxolitinib-treated patients. The dose subgroups are too small to 
draw conclusions on role of dose up-titration in efficacy. 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of Spleen response rate (RR), defined as the proportion of subjects with ≥35% 
Spleen volume reduction (SVR) at the End of Cycle 6 (EOC6) was similar in both studies but was more 
stringent in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) by requiring confirmation 4 weeks after EOC6 which was not 
required in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2). 
The Spleen RR based on ≥35% Spleen volume reduction is agreed as a criterion of spleen response by 
the Revised IWG-MRT (International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and 
Treatment) and is considered appropriate. 
The important secondary endpoint of Symptom RR was the same in both pivotal studies. It was defined 
as the proportion of subjects with ≥50% reduction in the total symptom score (TSS) (defined as the 
average value of the daily total score, which was calculated as the sum of the daily scores of the 6 
items of the modified MFSAF) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6. 
The modified MFSAF includes 6 key response elements of the MPN-SAF (Myeloproliferative Neoplasm 
(MPN)-associated symptoms, as measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment 
Form). These key symptoms are night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, filling early satiety, pain 
under ribs on left side, and bone or muscle pain and are recognised as being important as determining 
the symptom burden for the patient although fatigue which is common in patients with MF was not 
included. 
Study conduct, analysis and reporting of results 
There were 4 protocol amendments in Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) none of which are considered likely 
to have negatively impacted the conduct of the study or the data obtained. They concerned a more 
rigorous endpoint on symptom score i.e a ≥50% reduction in the total symptom score (TSS) instead of 
≥40% reduction in any of the 6 symptoms, introduced before the first patient first visit (22 Dec 2011). 
Amendments also improved safety monitoring and central review of bone marrow biopsy samples. 
Several important protocol deviations were identified in Study (JAKARTA) and in response to the D120 
LoQ, the applicant provided further information and clarification on these deviations, the most common 
of which involved a rerandomisation issue. At re-randomisation, to protect the blinding, subjects 
previously randomised to either 400 or 500 mg of fedratinib maintained the same dose level in a 
blinded fashion and were not permitted to cross over to a different dose level. Thus, re-randomisation 
deviations would have only been expected to have an impact on subjects who received placebo past 
Cycle 6, which occurred for 3 subjects. One subject who had approximately a half-cycle (15 days) 
longer treatment with placebo than planned per protocol, showed response to fedratinib and another 
for whom there was a delay of 7 days before starting fedratinib discontinued treatment in Cycle 8 due 
to PD. A third subject responded very well to fedratinib (reduction from baseline in spleen volume of 
58% at EOC12) and might have benefitted even more if the two cycles of treatment with fedratinib had 
not been missed. Overall the outcome for these 3 subjects does not seem to have been adversely 
affected by receiving placebo past Cycle 6. The argumentation of the applicant is accepted, that the 
rerandomisation deviations did not affect interpretation of the data for subjects who received placebo 
Assessment report

Page 122/170 
 
 
 
past Cycle 6 (i.e. after assessment of the primary and other key efficacy endpoints) due to re-
randomisation deviations. 
For 8 (2.8%) subjects, 2 subjects in the placebo arm and 6 subjects in the 500 mg arm, the treatment 
kit dispensed was not the same as the treatment kit authorised by IVRS. Deviations which consisted of 
a subject receiving the correct treatment per protocol but from a wrong kit that was dispensed instead 
of the allocated treatment kit are considered to be of a minor nature (3 subjects). Incorrect treatment 
with placebo (one cycle and one day) in 2 subjects while on treatment with fedratinib, and early start 
with fedratinib in Cycle 6 instead of Cycle 7 after crossover from placebo (1 subject) are not expected 
to have had adverse consequences for the subjects involved.  
Two subjects in the placebo arm, who should have switched to active treatment per protocol, 
continued to receive placebo. One subject did not crossover to fedratinib at Cycle 4 when MRI indicated 
PD and continued to receive placebo for a further 2 cycles followed by fedratinib or Cycles 7 through 
17. The other continued to receive placebo for 5 cycles after EOC6 and thereafter fedratinib 400 mg 
from Cycles 12 into Cycle 18. 
At one site no source documentation for study drug administration could be verified or was not 
recorded for 2 subjects which are considered to be serious issues concerning study conduct. The site 
was closed and persistent GCP issues at that site were appropriately addressed by Sanofi. 
The deviations concerning treatment administered which are considered most likely to have had the 
potential to negatively impact the outcome for 2 of the 3 subjects to whom it happened, concerned 
failure of timely crossover to active treatment from placebo. As these deviations occurred at 3 different 
sites, the study is long since closed and Sanofi is no longer the sponsor for this product it is not 
considered necessary to pursue these deviations further. 
All the deviations described are not considered to have affected the interpretation of the data relevant 
to the primary endpoint or to have influenced the outcome in favour of fedratinib. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) there were similar protocol amendments as in study EFC12153 
(JAKARTA) to improve safety monitoring. Notable protocol amendments in study ARD12181 were 
aimed at expanding the population. In Amendment 3 (28 Nov 2012 - first subject was enrolled on 30 
Apr 2012) the sample size was increased to 70 subjects in order to provide sufficient statistical power. 
Additionally, subjects who were intolerant to or allergic to ruxolitinib after receiving ruxolitinib 
treatment for less than 14 days were included as well as subjects categorised as intermediate-1 with 
symptoms. Nevertheless, a significantly higher number of patients was enrolled (97). In response to 
D120 LoQ the applicant provided a rationale for sample size increase and a sensitivity analysis based 
on first 70 evaluable patients, indicating that the Amendment did not appear to have a significant 
effect on efficacy analyses. 
Inclusion of patients with a lower risk category is not seen as likely to impact the primary (spleen 
response rate and main secondary endpoint (reduction in total symptom score (TSS)) as such subjects 
were also required to have spleen ≥5 cm below costal margin as measured by palpation and to have 
MF symptoms.  
The same applies to subjects included because of being intolerant to or allergic to ruxolitinib after 
receiving ruxolitinib treatment for less than 14 days and also allows collection of data from additional 
patients who may be in need of an alternative to ruxolitinib. 
CSR Addendum Study ARD1218 
In the CSR Addendum submitted by the applicant for study ARD12181, Cohort 1 consisted of all 
subjects enrolled in the study who met the post-hoc expert criteria for either R/R or intolerant to 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 123/170 
 
 
 
ruxolitinib. All analyses in the CSR Addendum were done on this ITT population (some 
supportive analyses were also done on the PP Population.) 
The LOCF method which imputed a missing spleen volume measurement at the End of Cycle 
6 with an End of Cycle 3 measurement, if available (and which had been pre-specified in the 
study ARD12181 SAP) was not applied in the CSR Addendum. It is agreed with the applicant that not 
applying LOCF may have provided a more objective and conservative estimation of the spleen RR at 
End of Cycle 6 in patients who may be R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib. 
In contrast use of LOCF and the per protocol population for the primary analyses of efficacy endpoint 
were pre-specified per the SAP for study ARD12181 and reported in the main CSR. 
Statistical analyses 
Statistical tests and regression models were adequate in both studies. The early study termination due 
to the FDA clinical hold did not influence the assessment of the spleen RR at end of cycle 6 (the 
primary endpoint) in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) but did limit the long-term follow-up. In particular, 
OS and PFS were not analysed. The analysis in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) was impacted more 
severely, as for 21/97 patients the primary endpoint was missing by early study termination only (i.e., 
not due to having, before the end of cycle 6 or before early study termination: a progression, adverse 
event, patient withdrawal, or non-evaluable scans). The original Sponsor (Sanofi) only analysed a 
selection of the originally protocol preplanned endpoints. Moreover, the primary analysis of spleen RR 
was on the Per Protocol set (i.e., patients needed to have an end of cycle 3 assessment) and missing 
end of cycle 6 assessment was imputed by the end of cycle 3 assessment (LOCF-imputation). It is not 
clear to which patient population this effect would apply and/or whether it would be a too optimistic or 
pessimistic estimate for the ITT population. Problems are for instance that patients may drop-out 
before the end of cycle 3, and also the end of cycle 3 assessment may not be representative for what 
is observed at the end of cycle 6. Moreover, the Sanofi inclusion was based on investigators’ 
judgement of patients being R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib. The applicant performed additional post-
hoc analyses addressing these issues. Cohort 1 and 1a were based on criteria for R/R or intolerance to 
ruxolitinib. However, applying these new criteria to patients preselected by investigators’ judgement 
does not necessarily represent the situation of recruiting patients based on these new criteria from the 
start. Analyses in the ITT sets (ITT, Cohort 1 ITT, Cohort 1a ITT) were applied using not only LOCF, 
but also non-responder imputation. The ITT analysis with non-responder imputation is at least 
interpretable as a conservative estimate for the spleen RR in the population satisfying the in/exclusion 
criteria regardless of intercurrent events leading to treatment discontinuation and lost-to-follow-up (a 
treatment policy estimand). Due to the early study discontinuation, missing data at cycle 6 only due to 
study termination is not informative for the outcome of these patients (missing-completely-at-
random). Leaving these patients out could be used to obtain another, more unbiased estimate in the 
ITT population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The principal efficacy data have been obtained by means of endpoints related to reduction in the size 
of the of the spleen and decrease in myelofibrosis related symptoms, in particular Spleen Response 
Rate and Symptom Response Rate in the 2 pivotal studies EFC12153 (JAKARTA), and ARD12181 
(JAKARTA2).

In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA), for the ITT Population, the primary endpoint of Spleen RR at the End of 
Cycle 6 confirmed 4 weeks later (rate and 95% CI) was: 
400 mg arm: 35/96 (36.5%; 26.8, 46.1); 500 mg arm: 39/97 (40.2%; 30.4, 50.0). Placebo n=1. 
For 12 subjects a spleen volume reduction of ≥35% at EOC6 was not confirmed in the confirmatory 
MRI/CT 4 weeks later (10 subjects with SVR 25% to 35% at 4 weeks later and 2 with SVR <25% at 2 
months later),for 6 subjects there were no confirmatory scan data and for one subject the confirmatory 
scan was done approximately 2 weeks after End of Cycle 6 instead of at 4 weeks after EOC6. 
The lack of confirmation of response 4 weeks later due either to non-confirmation or lack of data 
resulted in similarly lower response rates in both of the fedratinib arms, with 10 fewer responders in 
the 400 mg arm and 9 fewer in the 500 mg arm. 
The Spleen RR at EOC6 without confirmatory MRI/CT (rate and 95% CI) was: 
400 mg arm: 45/96 (46.9%; 36.9, 56.9); 500 mg arm: 48/97 (49.5%; 39.5, 59.4). Placebo n=1. 
Thus, without confirmation there was also a large difference in Spleen RR at EOC6 in both fedratinib 
arms compared to the placebo arm but the Spleen RRs obtained at EOC6 according to the primary 
endpoint with confirmed 4 weeks MRI/CT can be considered more conservative. 
Clear efficacy has been observed in terms of spleen volume reduction has been observed. Of the 67 
subjects in the fedratinib 400 mg arm who had data for spleen volume and TSS at baseline and at the 
EOC6, 24 (35.8%) subjects had both spleen and symptom response, 16 (23.9%) subjects had only 
spleen response, 11 (16.4%) subjects had only symptom response, and 16 (23.9%) subjects had 
neither spleen nor symptom response. However, most patients had some improvement in both 
endpoints, even if failing to meet the success criteria. 
For the placebo crossover subjects rerandomised to fedratinib after the initial randomisation period, 
the spleen RR at the End of Cycle 6 after fedratinib treatment was similar to that 28.6% (10/35) in 
the 400 mg arm and 44.4% (16/36) in the 500 mg arm although the small numbers of such patients 
precludes making firm conclusions. 
In study EFC12153 a considerable number of patients discontinued treatment permanently before end 
of Cycle 6 (24, 21 and 31 patients in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg arms respectively. The 
applicant was asked to provide and discuss available parameters of efficacy, in particular spleen 
size/volume (also symptom score (TSS) and safety) in patients who permanently discontinued before 
end of Cycle 6 and in patients who permanently discontinued after EOC6 in order to gain more insight 
into the further course of the disease after discontinuation. 
For patients who permanently discontinued, information regarding spleen volume reduction and on the 
applicant’s assessment of best response in Spleen Size Reduction per modified IWG-MRT criteria was 
available in the applicant’s response to the D120 LoQ. 
Very limited data were available on spleen volume reduction and the most relevant information is 
considered to come from patients who permanently discontinued treatment after the EOC6. Data were 
available from only 41 fedratinib treated patients (not counting patients who crossed over from the 
placebo arm) of whom 14.3% (3/21) of subjects in the 400 mg arm and 20.0% (4/20) in the 500 mg 
arm had a ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction at EOT. The mean percentage change in spleen size by 
palpation at the EOT for subjects with baseline assessments was -45.0% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm 
(in 67/75 subjects) and -54.3% in the 500 mg arm (in 52/66 subjects). 
Best response (spleen size reduction by palpation) after permanent treatment discontinuation based 
on all available spleen size assessments was assessed in all patients who had received fedratinib using 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 125/170 
 
 
 
the (IWG-MRT) criteria. It is understood that for this assessment, baseline assessment refers to an 
assessment prior to or at the EOT. 
Regardless of subsequent anticancer therapy, 79.6% (121/152) of subjects who had available spleen 
size assessments had a best response of stable disease after permanent treatment discontinuation. 
The RR (spleen size reduction of 50%) was 2.6% (4/152) and the rate of PD was 17.8% (27/152). 
Note that subjects who crossed over to fedratinib from placebo are counted for this analysis in the 
corresponding 400 or 500 mg fedratinib arm. Among subjects who received further anticancer therapy 
after permanent treatment discontinuation, the rate of stable disease was 73% (54/74) over both 
arms, the RR was 4.1% and the rate of PD was 23%. 
Among subjects who did not receive further anticancer therapy after permanent treatment 
discontinuation, the rate of stable disease was 85.9% (67/78) over both arms and only one subject 
(500 mg arm) had a response and the rate of PD was 12.8%.Available data on spleen size reduction by 
palpation are from EOT assessments which were to be performed at least 30 days following the last 
administration of fedratinib or placebo. These assessments have been performed soon after 
treatment/study discontinuation and therefore have limited potential to be informative about the 
ongoing status of the disease. 
According to the study design, the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) was not 
completed after the EOC6 thus no relevant data on TSS are available. 
The primary endpoint in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) was based on a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen 
volume by MRI for which there are few data after treatment discontinuation with most available data 
on spleen size post-discontinuation based on size by palpation, although it is reassuring that the mean 
percentage change in spleen size by palpation at the EOT was 45% to 50% (not including patients who 
crossed over from placebo).  
It is also somewhat reassuring that evaluated from a “baseline” point at or before EOT, approximately 
80% of patient were assessed as having a response corresponding to stable disease per modified IWG-
MRT criteria which is based on an assessment (by palpation) of spleen size reduction, although it can 
also be noted that the rate of PD was 17.8% in the 152 fedratinib patients for whom there were post-
discontinuation data. 
Overall, the additional information submitted does not suggest a high rate of loss of response but also 
does not provide a great amount of insight into the further course of the disease after discontinuation. 
Concerning patients who received ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea post-discontinuation as anticancer 
therapy, information regarding the applicant’s assessment of best response in Spleen Size Reduction 
per modified IWG-MRT criteria was available in the applicant’s response to the D120 LoQ for 41 
fedratinib treated subjects (7 of whom had crossed to fedratinib treatment). The majority of these 
patients (80%) were assessed as having stable disease based on spleen response. Unfortunately the 
information on efficacy of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy has not been separately evaluated in 
patients who received ruxolitinib and in patients who received hydroxyurea, nor in patients who 
received these treatments as a second line therapy or due to discontinuation of the study by Sanofi. 
There is also very little information on the duration of treatment with ruxolitinib or hydroxyurea. There 
is no analysis of survival and data on survival are extremely limited but it can be noted that 10 of the 
11 fedratinib treated patients who died had received hydroxyurea and 2 had received ruxolitinib (one 
subject had received both). Overall the numbers of patients are too low to draw any conclusions on 
efficacy of ruxolitinib compared to hydroxyurea following treatment with fedratinib or on response to 
ruxolitinib in patients previously treated with fedratinib. 
In ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), the effect in the ITT population with non-responder imputation (subjects 
with missing data on response status at EOC6 being counted as non-responders) is 30/97 responders 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 126/170 
 
 
 
i.e. 30.9%. This estimate is likely to be conservative, but is less conservative than the estimate 
counting subjects with dose up-titration as non responders (please see below). Twenty one of 97 
patients had an early study termination before EOC6 purely due to early termination, i.e., not related 
to efficacy outcome, that is without any of the following: progression, AE, reaching end of cycle 6 with 
a reduction <35%, patient withdrawal, or unevaluable measurement, so these 21 may be regarded as 
missing completely at random. Using this a more unbiased estimate would be 30/(97-21)=39.5%. 
Efficacy with up-titration of dose in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) 
In study ARD12182, up-titration to 500 mg or 600 mg was allowed if predefined efficacy and safety 
criteria were met: 33 patients had a dose up-titration, 17 up to a maximum dose of 500 mg once daily 
and 15 up to a maximum dose of 600 mg daily, and 1 patient received a single maximum dose of 800 
mg/day. 
Four of the 17 patients (4/17) who received up-titration to a maximum of 500 mg/day and 6/16 
patients who were up-titrated to a maximum of 600 mg/day achieved a ≥35% SVR (spleen volume 
reduction) after the dose up-titration. However, 7 of these 10 patients who had achieved a ≥35% SVR 
after the dose up-titration needed a dose reduction to 400 mg/day due to toxicity. For these 10 
patients, it is not clear if dose up-titration may have provided any additional clinical benefit. Most of 
the other patients did not achieve a ≥35% SVR and at least half of those patients needed a dose 
reduction due to toxicity and 3 of 17 patients who had up-titrated to 500 mg had achieved a ≥35% 
SVR before the dose increase. 
All in all, it is not evident that up-titration of the dose was of benefit to the patients. 
As the patients who responded only after dose up-titration are also counted in the total number of 
responders in study ARD12181, there may be an overestimation of the spleen RR observed with a dose 
of 400 mg in the population studied. The applicant provided an analysis of spleen RR in the ITT 
Population without LOCF, counting patients who only achieved a response after dose increase above 
400 mg as non-responders. The Spleen Response rate (without LOCF) for patients who received only 
400 mg, thus counting 8 subjects with dose up-titration as non responders, was lower at 22/97 
(22.7%; 14.8, 32.3) compared to 30/97 (30.9%; 21.9, 41.1) for those who had dose up-titration. The 
response rates are clearly lower when patients with dose up-titration are excluded. However, the 95% 
confidence intervals for the response rates with and without exclusion of patients who had dose up-
titration overlap almost fully in the analyses for both Spleen Response and Symptom Response. It can 
also be taken into account that 21 subjects did not have response assessments at EOC6 due to the 
clinical hold, and, because this event is unrelated to patient’s characteristics or outcome, distribution of 
responses would therefore be expected to be the same as in those in that were measured before the 
clinical hold (i.e. the denominator could be taken as 97-21 = 76, which would give a response rate of 
28.9%).  Overall it is still considered that clinically relevant response rates were achieved in study 
ARD12181. 
Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Endpoint Spleen Response Rate 
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), the Spleen RR (at the End of Cycle 6 With Confirmation 4 Weeks Later) 
was evaluated according to several subgroups defined according to baseline patient and disease 
characteristics. Taking into account the wide, overlapping confidence intervals for the difference in 
spleen RR between fedratinib and placebo in the various subgroups for both the 400 mg and 500 mg 
fedratinib arms it can be concluded that overall a fairly consistent picture of similar Spleen RR across 
subgroups was seen. This was also the case for comparisons between contrasting subsets of each 
subgroup e.g. age ≤65 years vs age >65 years, and importantly also for subgroups of interest in 
relation to disease characteristics such as myelofibrosis risk category and JAK2V617F mutational status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 127/170 
 
 
 
Similar Spleen RRs were observed between subjects in the 65 to 74 years age group and the smaller 
subgroup of subjects 75 to 84 years who received fedratinib 400 mg in Studies ECF12153 (JAKARTA) 
and ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) and these rates were consistent with those in the overall population. 
However, it must be noted that in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, for male subjects the Spleen RR at 
27.8% (95% CI:15.8, 39.7) was lower than for females in whom it was 47.6% (95% CI: 32.5, 62.7), 
with barely overlapping confidence intervals,  which was not seen in the fedratinib 500 mg arm, in 
which the Spleen RR was 42.6% in male subjects and 36.1% in females. 
In Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), as for ECF12153 (JAKARTA), regardless of the subgroups analysed 
fedratinib consistently showed clinical benefit in terms of spleen RR at the end of Cycle 6 within the 
subsets of each subgroup and over the subgroups in the overall ITT population and in Cohort 1. 
Notably, in study ARD 12181 (JAKARTA2) the spleen RR was also lower in males at 24.5% (95% CI 
12.9, 36.1) than in females in whom it was 38.6% (95% CI 24.2, 53.0) although the difference 
between males and females was less than in study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) and with more overlap in the 
95% confidence intervals.  
In response to a request to discuss the observed lower Spleen RR in males, the applicant mentions the 
larger spleen volume in males as one possible factor. In the information provided, the percentage 
reduction in spleen volume from baseline to EOC6 for males and females respectively in the 2 studies 
was:  EFC12153 Fedratinib 500 mg: 42% and 46%; EFC12153 Fedratinib 400 mg: 26% and 42%; 
ARD12181: 33% and 33% (apparently without exclusion of patients who had had dose up-titration).  
While suggestive of a lower effect in males with fedratinib 400 mg in study EFC12153, this was not 
consistent with the observation of the same percentage reduction in spleen volume in males and 
females in study ARD12181, in which the majority of patients received a dose of 400 mg (although a 
different study population having had prior ruxolitinib treatment). In popPK analysis FEDR-MPK-001, 
gender was not a statistically significant covariates affecting fedratinib PK exposure. The applicant has 
conducted, separately for each study, a logistic regression of modelling the primary efficacy endpoint 
and concludes that results show that sex is not a significant factor in predicting the outcome, after 
adjustment for selected baseline factors including spleen volume, body weight, ECOG PS. Overall, it is 
not established that males will have a lower response to fedratinib in terms of spleen volume reduction 
than females. 
In Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), in subgroup analyses of Spleen RR by the subgroups ruxolitinib 
relapsed/refractory (n=65) and intolerant (n=14) based on criteria recommended by MF experts 
(Cohort 1) revealed a rate of approximately 30% in both subgroups. This is consistent with the overall 
ITT study population (N = 97), although the number of ruxolitinib intolerant patients is too low to 
make conclusions about this subgroup. 
Overall the subgroup analyses have not revealed issues which are considered to require modifications 
to key sections of the SmPC. 
Secondary endpoint of Symptom Response Rate (RR) 
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), the Symptom RR (≥50% reduction in the total symptom score (TSS)) 
was 39.6% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, 34.1% in the fedratinib 500 mg arm compared to 8.2% in 
the placebo arm, clearly showing a benefit compared to placebo. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), the Symptom RR was 25.8%, somewhat lower than in the 400 mg 
arm of study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) but nevertheless clinically relevant. However, there is uncertainty 
concerning response rates in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) as dose up-titration was permitted.  As for 
spleen RR, the applicant provided an analysis of symptom response rate in the ITT population counting 
patients who only achieved a response after dose increase above 400 mg as non-responders.  
The Symptom Response rate  for patients who received only 400 mg, thus counting 4 subjects with 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 128/170 
 
 
 
dose up-titration as non responders, was lower at 20/93 (21.5%; 13.7, 31.2) for patients who received 
only 400 mg with 4 subjects considered non responders compared to 24/90 (26.7%; 17.9, 37) for 
those who had dose up-titration. Although lower in this analysis, it is still considered that clinically 
relevant response rates were achieved in study ARD12181.  
The requirements to have all of the symptoms scores for each day, and to have symptom scores from 
5/7 days to calculate the weekly score, require high compliance and may exclude patients faring 
poorly, and thus unable or unwilling to complete the symptom scoring. In response to D120 LoQ the 
applicant provided data on excluded symptom evaluations, demonstrating that symptom responses 
were similar also when all availbale symptom scores were included in the analyses. 
For individual symptom scores, in both pivotal studies (in both arms of ECF12153 (JAKARTA),  the 
largest reductions in scores were recorded for pain under ribs on left side, night sweats and early 
satiety with median percent of changes (reduction) of approximately 50% to 80% with night sweats 
close to 80% in both studies. For abdominal discomfort and itching the median percent of changes 
were approximately in the range 44% to 50% and lowest for bone or muscle pain at approximately 
22% to 30%. These percent changes over the range of symptoms show that improvement in all 
symptoms contributed to the reduction to TSS, some more than others. Notably, reduction in night 
sweats which may be attributable to reduced cytokine activity and reduction in symptoms which could 
be attributed to reduction in spleen volume, both of which are characteristically increased in 
myelofibrosis, showed the greatest reduction. 
Duration of Spleen response 
Median duration of Spleen response could not be fully assessed in either pivotal study due to the early 
termination of the studies. Assessment of overall Survival within either study was not feasible once the 
studies had been terminated. 
The lack of information on duration of the beneficial effects observed is likely to be met by the ongoing 
Phase 3 study FEDR-MF-002. 
Health-related quality of life 
HRQOL was assessed using different tools in the pivotal studies, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D™) questionnaire 
in study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) in 
study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2). Using these tools there was an improvement from baseline in both 
studies. In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) the improvement seems to have been moderate although 
there was no dis-improvement from baseline and the evaluation is hampered by the lack of a 
comparator arm for such a subjective assessment. In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), improvements 
relative to baseline were reported for both fedratinib arms compared to dis-improvement in the 
placebo arm, but the improvement tended to be less in the fedratinib 500 mg arm. These 
improvements in HRQOL seem to be in contrast with the quite large improvements in myelofibrosis 
related symptoms recorded by the MFSAF which one would expect to have had a greater impact on 
QOL although it is not clear that the QOL tools were adequate for capturing reduced burden of 
myelofibrosis related symptoms. In response to D120 LoQ the applicant provided available follow-up 
data collected at EOC and day 30 visits. Only EQ-5D1 data were collected after the EOC6. EQ-5D utility 
index scores were similar at EOC6 and EOT. The number of patients with data from 30-day follow-up 
visit is too low to draw any conclusions, but overall, no dramatic changes were observed. Overall, the 
data presented suggest relatively stable QoL throughout the treatment period. 
Supportive studies 
The dose-finding studies provided support the proposed posology of 400 mg/day.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In both pivotal studies the efficacy data robustly show a clinically relevant reduction in spleen volume 
with a spleen response rate, using a dose of 400 mg which is the intended dose for approval. In the 
fedratinib 400 mg arm of study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) which included JAK inhibitor naïve patients, the 
spleen response rate was 36.5%. In the single arm study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), in which fedratinib 
was investigated in patients who had previously received ruxolitinib, of whom the majority (79/97) 
were relapsed/refractory to or intolerant to ruxolitinib, using a non-responder imputation for missing 
data, a conservative estimate of the spleen response rate was 30.9% with the most conservative 
estimate being 22.7% if 8 subjects with dose up-titration are also counted as non-responders. 
For the 400 mg dose, the median reduction in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 6 was approximately 
40% in both studies and in study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) it was confirmed 4 weeks after EOC6. In both 
studies, MRI/CT scans were reviewed by an independent central imaging laboratory. 
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), the secondary endpoint of symptom response rate (RR) using the 
modified MFSAF was 39.6% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, 34.1% in the fedratinib 500 mg arm 
compared to 8.2% in the placebo arm. In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), the Symptom RR was 25.8%. 
The observed reduction in the total symptom score symptom burden is also considered to be of clinical 
relevance. 
While there is uncertainty in how to evaluate the benefit of fedratinib in patients with prior treatment 
with ruxolitinib (study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), in relation to available treatment options, this can be 
mitigated by the ongoing RCT study FEDR-MF-002 in which fedratinib is being compared to Best 
Available Therapy and which will be considered in the RMP as category 3 PASS.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
A total of 807 subjects (193 healthy volunteers, 75 subjects with solid tumours, and 539 subjects with 
MF, PV, or ET, of whom 459 were subjects with MF) received at least one dose of fedratinib in the 
clinical development programme. Of these, 608 patients received continuous doses of fedratinib for the 
treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, n=539, dose range 30-800 mg/day) or solid tumours 
(n=69, all 500 mg dose) which were included in Safety Analysis Pool #2. This included 1 phase 3 
placebo-controlled trial, 4 uncontrolled phase 2 trials and 4 phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies.  
In the 300 to < 450 mg group (n=299), the median average daily dose was 394.6 mg (range: 142.4 
to 554.9 mg), and the median duration of exposure was 40.6 weeks (range 0.7 to 281.0 weeks). A 
total of 199 subjects were exposed for ≥6 months or longer and 120 subjects were exposed for ≥12 
months or longer. In the 450 to < 550 mg group (n=237), the median average daily dose was 481.8 
mg (range: 96.0 to 538.5 mg) and the median duration of exposure was 31.0 weeks (range 0.1 to 
290.6 weeks). A total of 123 subjects were exposed for ≥6 months and 84 subjects were exposed for 
≥12 months. 
The primary focus of the safety analysis is on the data from the 2 key clinical studies EFC1253 (JAK-
naïve population, 400 and 500 mg) and ARD12181 (previously treated with ruxolitinib, 400 mg) and 
the Safety Pool #1 including these key clinical studies and study ARD11936 (JAK-naïve population, 
n=31, phase 2 dose-ranging 300-550 mg). Placebo treatment was restricted to up to 6 cycles of 
treatment. Safety data from the placebo patients who were randomised for cross-over were not 
included but are part of Safety Pool #2. This concerned 71 placebo subjects of which 35 received 400

mg and 36 received 500 mg fedratinib with a median duration of fedratinib exposure of 44 weeks in 
each fedratinib arm.  
Disposition of subjects in the key studies and Safety Pool #1 is shown in Table 50.  
A total of 17.7% and 28.9% patients in the 400 mg and 500 mg arm, respectively, discontinued before 
end of cycle 6 compared to 34.4% in the placebo group in study EFC12153. In study ARD12181, 
40.2% of patients discontinued before cycle 6. Overall, all patients discontinued treatment, mainly due 
to early study termination (about 45% to 65% in individual studies). The second most frequently 
reported reason for treatment discontinuation was adverse events (18.6% to 36.1% for fedratinib-
treated patients in individual studies). More patients in the 500 mg group discontinued treatment due 
to adverse events compared to the 400 mg group in study EFC12153. The main reason in the placebo 
group for treatment discontinuation was crossover to fedratinib after 6 cycles of treatment, according 
to protocol. The median duration of exposure in study ARD11936 was 54.0 weeks in the 300 mg 
treatment group, 87.8 weeks in the 400 mg treatment group, and 101.4 weeks in the 500 mg 
treatment group. 
Table 50: Disposition of subjects: Study EFC12153, Study ARD12181, and Safety Pool #1 (All 
Subjects) 
The extent of exposure is shown in Table 51. The median duration of exposure was 62.1 weeks for the 
400 mg arm, 59.7 weeks for the 500 mg arm and 24 weeks for the placebo arm in study EFC12153 
and 24.4 weeks for fedratinib 400 mg in study ARD12181. The mean relative dose intensity varied 
between 85.9% (500 mg dose study EFC12153) and 96.1% (study ARD12181) in the individual 
studies. At termination of studies, 62 and 57 subjects in the 400 and 500 mg arms, respectively, had 
received ≥ 12 treatment cycles in study EFC12153 and 14 subjects received ≥12 cycles of treatment in 
study ARD12181.

Overall for Safety Pool #1, a total of 203 subjects across the 3 studies were assigned to treatment with 
the recommended dose of 400 mg fedratinib; median duration of exposure was 35.6 weeks and 
median number of cycles initiated was 9. The duration of exposure was ≥ 6 months for 128 (63.1%) 
patients and ≥ 12 months for 77 (37.9%) patients. A total of 108 patients received 500 mg, median 
duration of exposure was 60.6 weeks and median number of cycles initiated was 15. The duration of 
exposure was ≥ 6 months for 77 (71.3%) patients and ≥ 12 months for 61 (56.5%) patients.  The 
median age was 65.0 years (range: 36 to 86 years); 47.0% of subjects were > 65 years of age and 
11.8% were > 75 years of age. The percentage of male subjects varied between 40.0%-62% in the 
different dose groups. Most subjects (89.1%) were Caucasian/White. Demographic and baseline 
disease characteristics of the patients in the pivotal studies are described in the efficacy section. Study 
ARD12181 included a more severe patient population with more advanced disease compared to 
subjects treated in first line in study EFC12153. More specifically, the ARD12181 study population had 
higher median baseline spleen volumes and median TSS. In addition, a higher number of subjects at

2.6.2.  Adverse events 
An overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported at any time for study 
EFC12153, study ARD12181, and Safety Pool #1 for the entire treatment duration is shown in Table 
52. Most patients had any TEAE and ≥90% had fedratinib treatment-related TEAEs. For the pooled 400 
mg dose, Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurred in 68.0% and treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in 49.8% 
of patients. Treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 11.3% of patients. About a

quarter of patients had TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation, and over 30% had 
TEAEs leading to dose interruptions and dose reductions. Any type of TEAE was more common in the 
500 mg arm compared to the 400 mg arm, except for death and treatment-related SAE (study 
EFC12153). Any type of TEAE was more common in the fedratinib-treated groups compared to 
placebo, except for death and treatment-emergent SAE when comparing data up to 6 cycles (data not 
shown). 
Within the pretreated patients (study ARD12181), TEAEs in all categories for fedratinib 400 mg were in 
general observed in the same order of magnitude as for the naïve population (study EFC12153), 
despite a shorter follow-up period. TEAEs were reported more frequently when comparing data up to 6 
cycles, the largest differences based on an indirect comparison were seen for grade 3 or 4 treatment-
related TEAEs (51.5% vs 37.5%) and TEAEs leading to dose reduction (36.1% vs 18.8%).

Common AEs 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥20%) in the pooled 400 mg group were diarrhoea (67.5%), 
nausea (61.6%), anaemia (51.7%), vomiting (44.8%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and fatigue 
(20.7%) (Table 53). The pattern of common AEs was comparable between the pretreated (study 
ARD12181) and naïve population (study EFC12153). Frequencies of TEAEs were in the same order of 
magnitude for the 400 mg and 500 mg group (study EFC12153). TEAEs reported with a ≥ 10% 
difference between the fedratinib arms were diarrhoea and fatigue (higher in the 400 mg group) and 
vomiting (higher in the 500 mg group).  
In general, the frequencies of all TEAEs (all grades) reported for subjects in the fedratinib groups were 
greater than or similar to the corresponding frequencies up to 6 cycles (study EFC12153). TEAEs 
reported with a ≥ 10% difference between analysis periods were anaemia (400 mg and 500 mg group) 
and fatigue (500 mg only).

Up to 6 cycles 
For the naïve population (study EFC12153), the most commonly reported TEAE in the placebo group 
was diarrhoea (15.8%). The TEAEs reported with a ≥ 5% difference in the 400 mg group versus the 
placebo group were diarrhoea (65.6% versus 15.8%), nausea (61.5% versus 14.7%), anaemia 
(39.6% versus 13.7%), vomiting (38.5% versus 5.3%), muscle spasms (11.5% versus 1.1%), blood 
creatinine increased (10.4% versus 1.1%), pain in extremity (10.4% versus 4.2%), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased and headache (each 9.4% versus 1.1%), weight increased (9.4% 
versus 4.2%), dizziness (8.3% versus 3.2%), bone pain (8.3% versus 2.1%), dysuria (6.3% versus 
0%), urinary tract infection (6.3% versus 1.1%), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased

(5.2% versus 0%). Additional TEAEs reported with a ≥ 5% difference in the 500 mg group versus the 
placebo group and not in the 400 mg were thrombocytopenia (18.6% vs 8.4%), constipation (16.5% 
vs 7.4%), asthenia (13.4% vs 6.3%), blood product transfusion dependent and hyperkalemia (each 
9.3% vs 2.1%), neutropenia (9.3% vs 0%), and lipase increased (8.2% vs 1.1%).  
TEAEs in the pretreated patients (study ARD12181) were in general reported in the same order of 
magnitude as those observed in the naïve population. TEAEs reported with a ≥10% difference between 
study ARD12181 and study EFC12153 were constipation (20.6% vs 9.4%), thrombocytopenia (26.8% 
vs 10.4%), pyrexia (11.3% vs 1.0%) and pruritis (17.5% vs 3.1%), all observed at higher frequencies 
in the pre-treated population.  
AE with toxicity ≥ Grade 3 
Overall, 68.0% of patients receiving 400 mg fedratinib reported grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (Safety Pool #1); 
most commonly reported (≥5%) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were anaemia (41.4%), thrombocytopenia 
(16.7%), lipase increased (5.9%), and diarrhoea (5.4%) (Table 54). The rate of Grade ≥ 3 
fatigue/asthenia for the entire treatment duration in the 400 mg was 5.9%. The pattern was 
comparable for the pretreated (study ARD12181) and naïve population (study EFC12153). Common 
(≥5%) grade 3 or 4 TEAEs for the 500 mg dose and with a ≥5% difference compared to the 400 mg 
dose were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, vomiting, nausea, and blood product transfusion dependent 
(Study EFC12153).  
Up to 6 cycles 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs ≥5% difference compared to placebo for the 400 mg group were anaemia and 
diarrhoea (study EFC12153) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of thrombocytopenia were comparable for the 400 mg 
group and placebo (5.2% vs 6.3%). For the 500 mg group these were besides anaemia and diarrhoea, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lipase increased, vomiting, nausea, and blood product transfusion 
dependent. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs ≥ 5% difference (increase) in the pretreated patients (study 
ARD12181) compared to study EFC1253 up to 6 cycles for 400 mg were anaemia (38.1% vs 30.2%)

treatment are not included if they occurred on or after the date of crossover. Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 
20.11 and were graded using NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event that started or worsened in severity 
on or after the date and time of the first study drug dose up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Table is sorted by 
descending frequency on the 400 mg Grade 3/4 column of Safety Pool #1. Safety Pool #1 includes Studies EFC12153, ARD12181,

Frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were reported in the same order of magnitude for the 
pretreated and naïve population except for thrombocytopenia which was more frequently reported in 
the pretreated patients (20.6% vs 8.3%, up to 6 cycles). Frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs for 
the entire treatment duration were largely similar but reported at somewhat higher frequencies than 
those reported up to 6 cycles. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, 5.9% and 5.6% of patients died on treatment in the 400 mg and 500 mg group, respectively 
(Table 57). There was no trend compared to placebo or for dose based on study EFC12153. Main cause 
of death was disease progression in the 400 mg group and adverse events in the 500 mg group. Most 
deaths post-treatment were due to progressive disease.

Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death during the entire treatment duration are presented in Table 
58. Thirteen subjects (6.4%) in the pooled 400 mg group and 8 subjects (7.4%) in the pooled 500 mg 
group reported TEAEs leading to death. Disease progression, acute myeloid leukaemia, 
cardiorespiratory arrest, and sepsis were each reported in 2 subjects (1.0%) in the 400 mg group, all 
other TEAEs leading to death were reported in 1 subject in either or both pooled groups. Cardiogenic 
shock and acute leukaemia in 1 subject each in the pooled 400 mg group from Study EFC12153 were 
treatment-related; all other TEAEs leading to death during the entire treatment duration in Safety Pool 
#1 were not treatment-related. The subject with cardiogenic shock had multiple underlying factors 
considered unrelated to fedratinib by the investigator, that triggered the subsequent events. The 
subject who died from acute leukaemia had a history of high-risk MF diagnosed 3 years before starting 
treatment and continued fedratinib until Cycle 16, when transformation to acute leukaemia occurred.

(2.5%) and cardiac failure (3.0%). Within study EFC12153, SAEs were in general comparable between 
400 mg and 500 mg group. AST and ALT increased was only reported in the 500 mg group.  
Up to 6 cycles 
Up to 6 cycles, the frequency of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs up was comparable between 
treatment groups in study EFC12153 (23.2%, 20.8%, and 26.8% in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg 
group, respectively). A higher frequency (34.0%) was observed in the pretreated population (study 
ARD12181).

Treatment-related SAEs 
Safety Pool #1: The frequency of subjects with treatment-related treatment-emergent SAEs reported 
were similar in the 400 mg and 500 mg groups (11.3% and 13.0%). Treatment-related SAEs reported 
in ≥ 2 subjects in any pooled dose group were anemia , pneumonia, diarrhoea, and acute kidney injury 
in the 400 mg group, and anaemia and WE in the 500 mg group (Table 60).

The frequencies of subjects with treatment-related treatment-emergent SAEs reported during the 
entire treatment duration were similar in the 400 mg and 500 mg groups (11.5% and 12.4%, 
respectively) (study EFC12153). Anaemia (2 subjects each in the 400 mg and 500 mg groups) was the 
only treatment-related treatment-emergent SAE reported during the entire treatment duration in >1 
subject in any treatment group.  
Treatment-related treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 11.3% in the pretreated population and was 
numerically higher than for the naïve population (6.3% at 400 mg up to 6 cycles). Pneumonia was the 
only treatment-related treatment-emergent SAE reported in > 1 subject and occurred in 2 subjects 
(study ARD12181).

and Safety Pool #1 (Safety Population) 
Other AEs of special interest (AESI) 
•  Grade 3 or 4 anaemia and RBC transfusion dependence 
Grade 3 or 4 anaemia was common, with low frequencies of serious Grade 3 or 4 anaemia (2.5% for 
the 400 mg dose Safety Pool #1). Overall, in Safety Pool #1 400 mg, permanent treatment 
discontinuation was infrequently seen (1.5%) and dose modifications were limited (6.4% reported dose 
reductions and 3.0% reported dose interruptions due to anemia. About 58.1% of patients received 
transfusions. The median time to onset of new or worsened ≥ Grade 3 anaemia was 60.0 days with 
75% of cases occurring within 114.0 days in the 400 mg. Frequencies were comparable or somewhat 
higher for the 500 mg dose group and median time to onset was somewhat earlier.  
Among the subjects who were RBC transfusion independent at baseline, 12.2%, 25.0% and 26.1% of 
subjects in the placebo, 400 mg and 500 mg group respectively became RBC transfusion dependent 
over the entire treatment duration (EFC12153). The number of RBC transfusions and rates of RBC 
transfusion dependency between the placebo and the 400 or 500 mg arms were comparable when

taking into account the difference in follow-up. Within study ARD12181, 27.7% of patients became 
RBC transfusion dependent. 
•  Grade 3 or 4 Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Transfusion 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was common, with low frequencies of serious Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia (1.5% for the 400 mg dose Safety Pool #1). Grade 3 or 4 bleeding events were 
reported in 4.4% in the 400 mg group. About 10% of patients had bleeding events associated with 
thrombocytopenia that required clinical intervention. The frequency of subjects with platelet 
transfusions was 8.9% in the 400 mg. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia 
was reported in 3.0% of patients and dose modifications were reported in the same order of 
magnitude. The median time to onset of new or worsened ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 69.5 days 
with 75% of cases occurring within 200.0 days in the 400 mg group. Frequencies for the 500 mg were 
largely comparable or somewhat higher. 
•  Cases of encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s 
Within Safety Pool #2, eight fedratinib-treated subjects with neurological signs or symptoms 
suggesting the diagnosis of potential WE or other encephalopathy were identified. The time on 
fedratinib until symptoms were described was between two and thirteen 28-day cycles. Seven out of 
the 8 subjects were taking fedratinib at 500 mg prior to the onset of the neurologic findings (doses 
were escalated in certain studies). Most events resolved with some residual neurological symptoms 
including memory loss, cognitive impairment and dizziness except for 1 subject with head and neck 
cancer, brain metastasis, difficulty eating, and weight loss who had a fatal outcome. The 1 male 
subject on 400 mg had findings most likely associated with hepatic encephalopathy and therefore the 
experts agreed that this was not WE. For one subject, consensus was reached on the diagnosis of WE 
whereas for the remaining 6 cases there was no consensus between experts. All 7 of these potential 
cases had pre-existing malnutrition, weight loss, significant GI AEs that were not adequately 
controlled, or other risk factors that may have contributed to thiamine deficiency. Except for one 
patient, (potential) cases of WE were amongst others treated with thiamine supplementation. 
•  Grade 3 or 4 ALT, AST, or Total Bilirubin (TBL) Elevation 
In Safety Pool #1, the frequencies of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 ALT, AST, or TBL elevation based on 
laboratory values were 6.4% in the 400 mg. The frequencies of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 ALT, AST, 
or TBL elevation (by PTs) and serious Grade 3 or 4 ALT, AST, or TBL elevation were 6.4% and 1.0%, 
respectively in the 400 mg. TE Grade 3 or 4 ALT, AST, or TBL elevation (by PTs) infrequently led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation or dose modifications. The median time to onset of any grade 
new or worsened transaminase (ALT or AST) elevation was 29.0 days for the 400 mg with 75% of 
cases occurring within 71.0 days. The median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 ALT was 168.0 days and 
the median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 AST was 192.0 days. Within the 500 mg group, grade 3 or 4 
AEs and SAEs were reported more frequently. Time to onset was comparable or slightly longer in the 
500 mg group compared to the 400 mg group.  
Within Safety Pool #2, there was 1 subject (study ARD11936) in the fedratinib 300 mg group who had 
Grade 4 elevations of ALT, AST, and bilirubin, meeting Hy's law criteria, and reported as hepatic failure 
that resolved following treatment discontinuation. 
•  Cardiac failure/Cardiomyopathy 
In Safety Pool #1, the frequency of cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy TEAEs (any grade) was 22.7% in 
the 400 mg. The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy AEs was 6.4% and the 
frequency of cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy AEs reported as an SAE was 6.9%. The frequencies of

subjects with peripheral oedema (PT; any grade) and cardiac failure (PT; any grade) were 12.3% and 
4.4%, respectively. In general, frequencies were in the same order of magnitude for the 500 mg dose 
group. Cardiac failure was considered treatment-related by the investigator for only 1 subject in the 
400 mg group (Study EFC12153) and there was only one report of Grade 5 cardiac failure in the 500 
mg group, which was not considered treatment related. Both subjects also had oedema peripheral. 
There was no consistent signal of cardiac failure in fedratinib-treated subjects compared with placebo 
up to 6 cycles (study EFC12153). 
•  Grade 3 or 4 Hyperamylasaemia or Hyperlipasaemia 
In Safety Pool #1, the frequencies of subjects with treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 
hyperamylasaemia or hyperlipasaemia based on laboratory values were 13.3% in the 400 mg. The 
frequency of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 hyperamylasaemia or hyperlipasaemia (AESI risk category 
based on TEAEs by PTs) was 8.9% in the 400 mg group and the frequencies of serious Grade 3 or 4 
events were 1.0%. According to protocol, Grade 3 or 4 hyperamylasaemia or hyperlipasaemia was 
treated with dose interruption and dose reduction and led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 
2.0% of patients. Grade 3 pancreatitis was reported for 1 subject in the 400 mg group in study 
EFC12153 and considered treatment-related. The event resolved after treatment discontinuation. The 
median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 lipase (laboratory value) was 60.0 days and the median time to 
onset of any grade new or worsened amylase/lipase elevation was 16.0 days in the 400 mg group; 
75% of cases occurred within 85.0 days. Results for the 500 mg were in general comparable. 
•  Secondary malignancies 
In Safety Pool #1, the frequency of treatment-emergent secondary malignancies was similar in the 
400 mg and 500 mg groups (5.4% and 4.6%, respectively). Neoplastic events primarily consisted of 
progression to AML, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.  
•  Gastrointestinal TEAEs 
TEAEs were most frequently reported in the gastrointestinal (GI) disorders system order class (SOC), 
and nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported PTs in the SOC. These events 
were primarily Grade 1 and 2, frequency of subjects with grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were limited as discussed 
previously in the section on Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs. Dose reductions or interruptions were reported in 
<10% of patients and treatment discontinuation occurred infrequently. Symptoms were commonly 
treated with antidiarrhoeals/intestinal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-emetics and antinauseants.  
For Safety Pool #1, the median time to onset of nausea (any grade) was 5.0 – 6.0 days in the 
fedrainib treated groups. Most events resolved and median time to resolution was 45.5 -52.5 days. The 
median time to onset of diarrhoea (any grade) was 6.0 days in the 400 mg and the median time to 
resolution was 16.5 days. The median time to onset of vomiting (any grade) was 2.0 days and the 
median time to resolution was 9.0 -11.0 days. In general for these GI TEAEs, the pattern of early onset 
and high frequency in the first cycle was followed by a steady decrease in the subsequent 2 cycles with 
stabilisation with some variability was commonly observed up to Cycle 6. 
•  Severe infection 
Safety Pool #1: The frequency of subjects with severe infection (any grade, applicant-based definition 
including opportunistic and viral infections) during the entire treatment duration was 5.4% in the 400 
mg group and 5.6% in the 500 mg group. The frequency of subjects with severe infection (any grade) 
up to 6 cycles was 3.2% in the placebo group, 3.0% in the 400 mg group, and 2.8% in the 500 mg 
group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 144/170 
 
 
 
The frequency of subjects with TEAEs (all grades and SAEs) in the infections and infestations SOC was 
comparable between fedratinib arms and placebo (study EFC12153 up to 6 cycles). 
•  Blood creatinine increased 
In Safety Pool #1, increased blood creatinine by laboratory values (all grades) was reported in 73.9% 
in the 400 mg group, Grade 3 events were reported in 3% of subjects. Dose modifications and 
treatment discontinuation were low. The median time to onset of any grade creatinine increased in 
occurred in Cycle 1 at 27.0 days, with 75% of cases occurring within 82.0 days. Treatment-emergent 
renal failure was reported in 2.0% of patients and treatment-emergent chronic kidney disease was 
reported in 0.5%. Acute kidney injury was reported in 1.0% of patients and treatment-emergent 
dehydration in 2.5% of patients.  
2.6.3.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Safety Pool #1: Shifts in the severity of anaemia and white blood cell counts from baseline Grade 0 to 
2 to Grade 3 (worst grade) on treatment up to 6 cycles occurred more frequently in the fedratinib 
groups compared with the placebo group. Shifts in the severity of platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte 
counts were comparable for the 400 mg and placebo group and higher for the 500 mg group for 
platelet counts and neutrophil counts compared to placebo. 
In general, haematology values across analytes remained stable in the placebo group (up to 6 cycles), 
while fedratinib treatment was associated with decreasing values through 12 cycles, with the largest 
decrease occurring between baseline and the first on-treatment data point (Cycle 2) for haemoglobin, 
leukocytes (WBC), neutrophils, and platelets. For leukocytes and neutrophils, this early drop in values 
was substantial, with values decreasing nearly 50% in both the 400 and 500 mg groups. Following 
nadir, there was a partial recovery in mean haemoglobin levels though 12 cycles, but mean platelet 
counts remained lower.  
Serum chemistry 
The largest changes in mean serum chemistry values typically occurred between baseline and the first 
on-treatment data point (Cycle 2). Overall, shifts in clinical chemistry parameters were observed 
infrequently among subjects in both pivotal studies and the safety pool #1, and even fewer subjects in 
either group had shifts to values Grade ≥3. Larger mean change increases from baseline to Cycle 12 
(approximately 10% to 33%) were noted for ALT, amylase, creatinine, and lipase; larger decreases 
were noted for ALP, LDH, and urate. The frequencies of subjects with electrolyte or metabolic 
laboratory abnormalities were generally similar among the treatment groups in study EFC12153.  
Mean prothrombin time (in Safety Pools #1) and mean activated partial thromboplastin time (in Safety 
Pool #2) decreased over time in fedratinib-treated subjects, however these changes were not clinically 
meaningful.  
Vital signs 
No clinically relevant changes in vital signs were reported across the safety population in Safety Pool 
#1 and #2 and there was no sign of prolongation of QTc.

2.6.4.  Safety in special populations 
•  Age 
Within the Safety Pool #1, 151 (47%) were >65 years and 38 (12%) were >75 years of age. In 
general, the frequency and distribution of TEAEs was similar in subjects ≤ 65 versus > 65 years of age 
and similar relationships were observed when comparing the placebo and fedratinib treated groups. In 
subjects > 65 years, increased rates of diarrhoea and anaemia in the fedratinib 400 and 500 mg 
groups were also observed in the placebo group. A total of 66 patients >75 yrs were included in Safety 
Pool #2, of which 59 received doses ≥300 mg. Caution must be taken in this comparison due to the 
small number of subjects in the > 75 years of age.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events reported with the recommended posology of 400 mg daily are 
presented in Table below according to age subgroups. In patients aged 75 to <85 years, there was an 
apparent trend towards increased Treatment-Emergent SAE requiring or prolonging hospitalisation and 
towards an increase in other medically important events (~26% vs <10% in younger patients), a 
pattern which may reflect additional precautionary care in elderly patients. In patients aged ≥75 years 
the rate of TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation was not higher than in younger 
patients and there were no cases of treatment-emergent SAE leading to death. Due to the small 
number of subjects aged ≥75 years of age (n=28) caution must also be taken in this evaluation.

Table 61 Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events by criteria or Me-dDRA terms and 
age subgroups during the entire treatment duration of fedratinib 400 mg treatment in safety 
pool (Safety Population)  
•  Gender 
A total of 137 (43%) of patients were female in Safety Pool #1. There was generally no consistent 
pattern of differences in the occurrence of TEAEs between male and female subjects. Female subjects 
experienced somewhat higher frequencies of Gastrointestinal Disorders, especially for nausea and 
vomiting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020

•  Race 
Most patients were white race (286, 89.1%), 28 (8.7%) were Asian in Safety Pool #1. The safety 
profiles of the white and Asian subgroups were consistent with the overall fedratinib safety profile. 
Interpretation of the race subgroups of black and other were too small to provide meaningful 
evaluation. 
•  Baseline platelet count 
Fedratinib has not been studied in patients with a baseline platelet count <50 x 109/L. Patients with 
low baseline platelet count (<100 x 109/L) were 48/203. In general, the frequency and distribution of 
TEAEs were similar across baseline platelet count subgroups and were similar to the frequency and 
distribution of all TEAEs in Safety Pool #1. In the 400 mg group, common TEAEs reported in ≥15% of 
fedratinib subjects with baseline platelet count <100 × 109/L that were observed at higher frequencies 
(≥5% difference between subgroups) than the baseline platelet count ≥100 × 109/L group included 
the haematological events of anaemia and thrombocytopenia. 
•  Baseline Hb level 
In general, the frequency and distribution of TEAEs was similar in subjects with baseline haemoglobin 
level ≤ 10 g/dL and > 10 g/dL and similar relationships were observed when comparing the placebo 
and fedratinib treated groups. However, anaemia and ≥Grade 3 anaemia was reported more frequently 
in the subgroup with Hb ≤10 g/dL (65.5% any grade and 60.9% ≥Grade 3 vs 25.0% any grade and 
12.9% ≥Grade 3 in patients with Hb > 10 g/dl). Thrombocytopenia was also reported at numerical 
higher frequencies. 
•  Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no studies with the use of fedratinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity.  
There are no data on the presence of fedratinib or its metabolites in human milk.  
No human data on the effect of fedratinib on fertility are available. Studies in animals have not shown 
adverse effects on fertility apart from an increase in post-implantation loss with a reduction in viable 
foetuses. 
•  Liver impairment 
Within safety Pool #1, patients with mild/moderate baseline hepatic function were 76/203 in the 400 
mg group and 109/321 (34%) overall. In general, the frequency and distribution of TEAEs was similar 
in subjects with normal or impaired hepatic function at baseline and similar relationships were 
observed when comparing the placebo and fedratinib treated groups. There are no data in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
•  Renal impairment 
In safety Pool #1, patients with mild/moderate baseline renal function were 135/203 in the 400 mg 
group and 218/321 (68%) overall. In general, the frequency and distribution of TEAEs was similar in 
subjects with normal or impaired renal function at baseline and similar relationships were observed 
when comparing the placebo and fedratinib treatment groups.

2.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Agents that strongly induce CYP3A4 may decrease fedratinib exposure (Fedratinib-DMPK-2852) and 
should be avoided in patients receiving fedratinib. Concomitant administration of fedratinib with strong 
and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase fedratinib exposure (Study INT12893; Fedratinib-DMPK-
2852), requiring fedratinib initial dose to be reduced to 200 mg and 300 mg with strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, respectively.  
Fedratinib can increase plasma levels of drugs that are metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 
(Study INT12497). 
2.6.7.  Overdose 
Overdose was reported for 6 subjects in the fedratinib clinical development programme. All events 
were ≤Grade 2 and non-serious events. 
2.6.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation during the 
entire treatment duration was 24.1% in the 400 mg pooled group and 33.3% in the 500 mg pooled 
group (24.1% versus 33.3%). The most frequent TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation in Safety Pool #1 were primarily GI and haematological TEAEs (Table 62). 
Thrombocytopenia and vomiting led to permanent treatment discontinuation more frequently in the 
500 mg group compared with the 400 mg group. Up to 6 cycles, frequency of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation was numerically higher in the pre-treated patients (study ARD12181) compared to the 
naïve population (study EFC12153) for the 400 mg group (19.6% vs 13.5%).

discontinuation reported in ≥ 2% of subjects in any 400 mg or 500 mg fedratinib treatment 
group during entire treatment duration in Study EFC12153, Study ARD12181, and Safety 
Pool #1 (Safety Population).   
TEAEs leading to dose reduction 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 33.0% and 50.0% in the 400 mg and 500 mg group 
in Safety Pool #1, respectively. In the pooled 400 mg group, TEAEs most commonly leading to dose 
reduction were anaemia (6.4%), thrombocytopenia (3.4%) and gastrointestinal events; nausea 
(4.9%), diarrhoea (4.4%), and vomiting (2.5%). Dose reduction due to TEAEs occurred more 
frequently in the 500 mg group compared to the 400 mg group, the most notable difference is seen for 
anaemia (14.4% for 500 mg vs 7.3% for 400 mg in study EFC12153). TEAEs leading to dose reduction 
were more commonly reported in the pre-treated patients (study ARD12181) when comparing the 400 
mg dose up to 6 cycles (ARD12181: 36.1% vs ECF12153: 18.8% for the 400 mg group). The pattern 
of AEs was comparable between studies. 
TEAEs leading to dose interruption 
TEAEs leading to dose interruption were reported in 32.0% and 48.1% in the 400 mg and 500 mg 
group in Safety Pool #1, respectively. In the pooled 400 mg group, TEAEs most commonly leading to 
dose interruption were nausea (6.4%), diarrhoea (5.9%), vomiting (5.4%), anaemia (3.0%) and 
thrombocytopenia (2.5%). TEAEs leading to dose interruption were more commonly reported in the 
pre-treated patients (study ARD12181) when comparing the 400 mg dose up to 6 cycles (ARD12181: 
26.8% vs ECF12153: 20.8% for the 400 mg group). The pattern of AEs was comparable between 
studies.

2.6.9.  Post marketing experience 
Fedratinib was approved by the FDA on 16 Aug 2019 and therefore, at the time of this submission, no 
notable post-marketing safety data have been received. 
2.6.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for fedratinib has been provided from 608 patients receiving continuous doses, of which 
539 received treatment for myeloproliferative disorders (dose range 30-800 mg/day) and 69 for solid 
tumours (500 mg dose) (Safety Pool #2). The safety evaluation is focussed primarily on the pivotal 
studies EFC12153 (naïve population, placebo-controlled, 400 mg and 500 mg dose) and ARD12181 
(ruxolitinib-pretreated population, single arm, 400 mg dose) which are combined in Safety Pool #1 
together with data from the phase 2 study ARD11936 (naïve population, n=31, 300 mg. 400 mg, 500 
mg dose). A total of 203 patients received the proposed recommended dose of 400 mg, 108 patients 
received the 500 mg dose. The median number of cycles was 6 for study ARD12181 and 14-16 for 
study EFC12153. For the pooled 400 mg group, median number of cycles was 9. Overall, 128 patients 
received 400 mg and 77 patients received 500 mg dose for ≥6 months.  A total of 77 patients received 
400 mg and 61 received 500 mg dose for ≥12 months. Therefore, the safety database is sufficient to 
assess the safety profile of fedratinib and the requirements as laid down in ICH E1 (CPMP/ICH/375/95) 
(about 300-600 patients for 6 months and 100 patients for 12 months) are met. Uncertainties remain 
on long term safety due to early study termination, while treatment exposure is likely to be substantial 
longer in clinical practice with a median survival of 3.5 to 5.5 years, depending on prognostic score. 
Long-term data for ruxolitinib in the COMFORT-I study showed that about one quarter of patients with 
intermediate-2 or high-risk MF were still on treatment after 5 years (Verstovsek et al, 201715). This 
study was part of the MAA of ruxolitinib and included patients with palpable splenomegaly (at least 5 
cm below costal margin) that were refractory to or not candidates for available therapy. It is partly 
reassuring that there were no new or unexpected safety signals identified in this long-term study, 
given the overlap in mechanism of action between ruxolitinib and fedratinib.  
AEs were reported for almost all patients who received fedratinib. Dose delays or reductions due to 
TEAEs were frequently seen (>25% each within the pivotal studies). A substantial part of the patients 
discontinued treatment due to TEAEs (12% before end of cycle 6 and almost 25% overall for the 
pooled 400 mg dose), indicating a non-negligible safety profile limiting patient’s benefit from fedratinib 
treatment. Most TEAEs were reported in 1 or 2 subjects. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were 
more common with the 500 mg dose and more patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs 
compared to the 400 mg dose. The lower tolerability in combination with a marginal added benefit with 
the 500 mg dose, supports the choice of 400 mg as the recommended dose.  
Gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) were very common with fedratinib treatment 
and occurred soon after start of treatment. Most were grade 1 and grade 2 events and only few 
patients discontinued treatment due to these events. Events were treated with dose modifications and 
symptomatic treatment. Appropriate statements including dose modifications for ≥Grade 3 events and 
warnings are included in the SmPC (section 4.2 and 4.4). Prophylactic use of anti-emetics and 
administration with high fat meal are proposed to reduce the risk of these events. The impact of these 
measurements to reduce GI events is further investigated in the planned study PASS FEDR-MF-002 
included in the RMP. Higher frequencies of constipation were also observed, especially with the 500 mg 
dose (16.5% vs 7.4% placebo) and part of these events were considered treatment-related (7.4% 
patients in the 400 mg group and 8.3% patients in the 500 mg group). Therefore, constipation is

included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Nevertheless, it can not be excluded that part of the 
events is related to the complications of the disease (increased spleen) or use of antidiarrhoeals.  
Other AEs commonly reported with fedratinib treatment were anaemia and thrombocytopenia. These 
events are directly related to the mechanism of action of JAK inhibition. Anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia were commonly reported as ≥Grade 3 events and primarily treated with 
blood/platelet transfusions and dose modifications. Adequate warnings and dose modifications are 
included in section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. The higher rates of anaemia and especially 
thrombocytopenia in the pre-treated population may be explained by the more advanced disease 
status of these patients, with lower baseline Hb levels and platelet count compared to the naïve 
population.  
Thrombocytopenia results in an increased risk of bleeding events and thrombocytopenia/bleeding are 
followed-up by questionnaires in the RMP. A warning on thrombocytopenia and increased risk of 
bleeding is included in section 4.4 SmPC. Among patients enrolled into JAKARTA2, 33% were reported 
as being intolerant to ruxolitinib, with haematologic toxicity (particularly thrombocytopenia and 
anaemia) quoted as being the most common type of intolerance (reported for 25.8% of patients). 
Although there is overlap in haematological toxicology between ruxolitinib and fedratinib, a substantial 
portion of patients intolerant to ruxolitinib due to haematologic toxicity were able to remain on 
fedratinib treatment without re-emergence of unmanageable haematologic intolerance. Though based 
on a limited dataset (n=25), these data indicate that fedratinib is a possible treatment option for these 
patients. 
Fedratinib was not studied in patients with platelet count <50 x 109/L and treatment is not 
recommended. In addition, fedratinib was not studied in patients with baseline ANC count <1 x 109/L. 
Appropriate warnings are included in section 4.4 with reference to section 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Given the risk of cytopenias, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to start of fedratinib 
treatment. This is adequately stated in section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
GI and haematological events were also the most frequently reported treatment-related events with 
higher incidence in the fedratinib group compared to placebo. Exposure-safety analyses indicated that 
increasing fedratinib exposure increases probability of nausea/vomiting of any grade. The effect 
exposure on the probability of anemia or thrombocytopenia was less clear, but likely masked by the 
effect of baseline Hb level and platelet count which were important covariates.  
ALT and AST increased have been reported more frequently with fedratinib compared to placebo, 
indicative of hepatotoxicity. This is in line with what is known of ruxolitinib and JAK inhibitors in 
general. There was only one case meeting Hy’s law criteria in Safety Pool #2. In addition, lipase and 
amylase levels were commonly increased with fedratinib with one case of pancreatitis in Safety Pool 
#2. Warnings are included in section 4.4, including recommendations for monitoring of enzymes and 
dose modifications in section 4.2 in case of ≥Grade 3 events. These warnings are considered adequate. 
In addition, a study is being conducted to characterise the effects of moderate and severe HI on the PK 
of fedratinib to provide guidance on the use of fedratinib in patients with HI, the results have been 
requested as part of the pharmacovigilance plan (please see RMP section below). 
Other AEs reported more frequently with fedratinib compared to placebo and included in section 4.8 
are muscle spasms, bone pain, pain in extremity, blood creatinine increased, headache, dizziness, 
dysuria, and urinary tract infection. Dyspepsia and dysuria were added given the imbalance between 
fedratinib (4.4% each) versus placebo (0%) and hypertension and fatigue/asthenia based on the 
number of ≥Grade 3 events. Hypertension is also a known adverse drug reaction (ADR) for ruxolitinib, 
although the mechanism of action is unknown. There was no increase in severe infections and virus 
zoster infections compared to placebo. Infections including viral reactivation are a potential risk with 
JAK inhibitors given that the JAK/STAT pathway is a signaling pathway for inflammatory/many 
Assessment report

cytokines. Fedratinib does not inhibit JAK1, in contrast to ruxilotinib, which is involved in antiviral 
responses through Type I interferon signaling. Nevertheless, severe infection is included as a potential 
risk in the RMP based on the class effect which is agreed upon. This is of importance as infections are a 
major complication and cause of death in MF patients. Also non-clinical data indicate an 
immunosuppressive effect of fedratinib.  
On-treatment deaths and TEAEs leading to death were comparable between fedratinib and placebo 
groups. Most events occurred in single subjects and were not considered treatment-related. There was 
no signal for an increased risk of cardiac failure. This was initially of concern in combination with the 
reports on Wernicke’s encephalopathy because of the potential association with thiamine deficiency. 
Fedratinib did not show QTc prolongation.   
Overall, rate of serious adverse events was comparable between fedratinib and placebo and most 
events occurred in 1 or 2 subjects. Pneumonia was reported more frequently, especially in the pre-
treated population. There was no relationship with neutropenia and it is agreed that pneumonia is not 
included as an ADR. Patients with MPN-associated MF have an increased risk of transformation to AML 
which is a major cause of death. Leukemic transformation was the most frequently reported secondary 
malignancy, besides basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. There is currently 
no signal of an increased risk for secondary malignancies based on the data, however long-term 
follow-up to identify secondary malignancies is limited and malignancies are a known potential risk for 
JAK inhibitors. Therefore, secondary malignancies is explicitly stated as missing information in the 
safety specification of the RMP (please see RMP section below). 
There were 8 potential cases of encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s, which led to the clinical hold of 
the fedratinib studies. WE is not known for ruxolitinib or other JAK inhibitors. Fedratinib does cross the 
Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) to a certain extent, and although preclinical data do not suggest WE-like 
symptoms or central nervous system pathology upon administration of fedratinib, these models are not 
very predictive for humans due to low exposure levels. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is an acute 
neurological disorder as a result of thiamine deficiency. There is no direct interaction of fedratinib with 
the thiamine receptor impacting thiamine absorption based on non-clinical data. One explanation could 
be that the cases are the results of poor control of the fedratinib associated GI AEs (nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhoea) in undernourished subjects in combination with other risk factors. All potential cases of 
WE occurred in the 500 mg group, in which in general more ≥Grade 3 GI events were reported. 
However, the exact cause of potential WE in patients treated with fedratinib remains unknown.  
Though thiamine levels were not measured in most cases, almost all patients received thiamine 
supplementation as part of their treatment. Risk mitigation strategies incorporated in the SmPC for 
fedratinib include measurement of thiamine levels before start of treatment and periodically during 
treatment. Thiamine should be replenished in case of deficiency. Further, dose modifications are 
included in section 4.2 and a warning in section 4.4. This is agreed upon. Risk of WE is also included as 
an identified risk in the RMP. Additional information on risk mitigation strategies and thiamine levels in 
the target population will become available from the ongoing study FEDR-MF-002.  
Apart from the known pharmacokinetic interaction with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, there is also a 
potential pharmacodynamic interaction with haematopoietic growth factor drugs, such as G-CSF and 
erythropoietin, which could be a potential important safety problem if it means that cytopenic patients 
will be unresponsive to treatment with the needed growth factor in question. In the absence of data, 
no recommendations can be included in the SmPC, a warning is included in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC. Further follow-up is needed through routine pharmacovigilance activities and cases of potential 
reduced efficacy due to PD interactions will be described.  
There was no clinical evidence of any ill effects associated with cessation of therapy. This in contrast to 
ruxolitinib where in some cases MF symptoms returned more severely after stopping treatment. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 153/170 
 
 
 
difference may be explained by the differences in mechanism of action, with ruxolitinib stabilising the 
kinase active formation and fedratinib the kinase inactive formation.  
The safety profile in important subgroups is in general comparable to that of the total population. Data 
in patients >75 years is limited, with 38 patients exposed in Safety Pool #1 and 66 patients in Safety 
Pool #2. A statement on limited data in patients >75 years is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Patients with low baseline Hb and platelet count have an increased risk of anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia and a warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There are no direct comparative safety data with ruxolitinib, which is the current standard of care in 
patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. The safety profile partly overlaps due to JAK2 inhibition, 
however fedratinib does not act on JAK1 which may result in a different safety profile. Based on 
indirect comparison, the discontinuation rate appears lower for ruxolitinib (about 10%). Also, infections 
and bleedings appear less frequent with fedratinib whereas amylase/lipase increased is more frequent. 
Further, the type of GI events differ. Overall, based on differences in safety profile, fedratinib could be 
an alternative to ruxolitinib in JAK-inhibitor naïve patients and an addition to the therapeutic arsenal 
for treating physicians.  
Available post-marking data from the USA does not indicate new safety signals. Preliminary safety data 
from the currently ongoing studies with fedratinib in ruxolitinib-experienced patients does not raise 
new concerns. 
Uncertainties remain with regards to the long-term safety due to the early study discontinuations, 
including the risk of secondary malignancies, therefore the study results of the ongoing FEDR-MF-002 
study have been requested as part of the RMP.  
In addition, a study is being conducted to characterise the effects of moderate and severe HI on the PK 
of fedratinib to provide guidance on the use of fedratinib in patients with HI, the results have been 
requested as part of the pharmacovigilance plan (please see RMP section below). 
2.6.11.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data support the recommended proposed dose of 400 mg. Still the profile of fedratinib is 
non-negligible with about a quarter of patients discontinuing treatment. The safety profile of fedratinib 
is characterised mainly by the haematological events anaemia and thrombocytopenia and GI events 
(nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea). Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are directly related to the 
mechanism of action of JAK2 inhibition, often severe but manageable by transfusions or dose 
modifications. GI events were mostly of mild severity.  
Several AEs like AST/ALT increased and creatinine increased are in line with what is known for other 
JAK inhibitors. A study is being conducted to characterise the effects of moderate and severe HI on the 
PK of fedratinib to provide guidance on the use of fedratinib in patients with HI, the results have been 
requested as part of the pharmacovigilance plan (please see RMP section below). The risk of severe 
infections including viral reactivation appears low but is included in the safety specifications as 
potential risk based on the class effect. Uncertainties remain regarding long term safety due to the 
early study discontinuations, including the risk of secondary malignancies, therefore the study results 
of the ongoing FEDR-MF-002 study have been requested as part of the RMP (please see RMP section 
below).  
Encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s, is a serious AE of concern which might be related to fedratinib’s 
GI toxicity contributing to thiamine deficiency in a vulnerable population. However, the exact cause 
remains unknown. This risk is considered manageable with monitoring of thiamine levels and thiamine 
supplementation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020

Overall, the safety profile can be considered acceptable in the target population with limited treatment 
options and no major objections are identified precluding marketing authorisation.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16.08.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of fedratinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers fedratinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and package leaflet for the purpose of providing to 
patients access to the most recent approved package leaflet in their selected language has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: Package Leaflet 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Inrebic (fedratinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as this is a new active substance additional information should be collected as 
early as possible to further elucidate the risk profile of the product when used in clinical practice.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Myelofibrosis (MF) belongs to the category of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and may present as 
a primary disorder (primary myelofibrosis [PMF]) or evolve from polycythaemia vera (PV) or essential 
thrombocythaemia (ET) to post-PV or post-ET MF. It is characterised by the clonal proliferation of a 
pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell, in which the abnormal stem cell population releases several 
cytokines and growth factors into the bone marrow microenvironment, thus leading to an increase in 
bone marrow fibrosis, stromal changes, involvement of extramedullary organs such as the spleen and 
liver, and consequent clinical manifestations. The symptoms mainly include those associated with 
splenomegaly (abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, splenic infarction, dyspnoea, and 
diarrhoea) and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, cachexia, pruritus, bone pain, weight loss, 
and fever, impacting QoL. The diagnosis is based on WHO criteria (2008, updated in 2016) and the 
prognostic score is based on IWG-MRT criteria. Median survival ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5 
years and depends on the prognostic score. Most frequent cause of death in patients with MF is 
transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (20%). Most patients die because of other disease-related 
events, such as progression without transformation, infections, and thrombo-haemorrhagic 
complications. Mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL activating the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer 
and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, may play a role in the pathogenesis of MF. 
However, the exact cause remains unknown. 
The proposed indication for Inrebic is: 
Fedratinib is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis, who are JAK inhibitor naïve or have been treated with ruxolitinib.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently the only curative option for MF is haemaetopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), 
however most patients are ineligible for HSCT. Considering the clinical manifestations of the disease 
the aim of treatment is to gain symptom control. Ruxolitinib (Jakavi, JAK1/1 inhibitor) is the only 
available targeted treatment which has been shown to reduce spleen size, symptom burden and 
improve survival. Other therapeutic options for MF include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), 
danazol, and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide) for 
improvement of anaemias and hydroxyurea and interferon for the treatment of splenomegaly and/or 
constitutional symptoms. The selection of appropriate treatment is based on the risk score and 
presence of symptoms. There is no standard of care for patients progressing on ruxolitinib. Hence, 
there is a clear unmet medical need for patients with MF. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for the JAK-naïve population is from a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 3-arm study in adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary MF, post-PV MF, or 
post-ET MF with splenomegaly (study EFC12153 - JAKARTA). Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to 400 
mg (n=97) or 500 mg (n=97) fedratinib or placebo (n=96) once daily. Fedratinib treatment was 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 160/170 
 
 
 
continued as long as patients benefitted from therapy, patients on placebo could cross-over to 
fedratinib at the end of cycle 6.  
The main evidence for the ruxolitinib-pretreated population is from a phase II, open-label, single arm 
study in adult patients previously treated with ruxolitinib and with a current diagnosis of intermediate 
or high-risk MF post-PV MF, or post-ET MF with splenomegaly (study ARD12181 – JAKARTA2). Patients 
(n=97) received fedratinib once daily for at least 6 cycles and treatment could be continued as long as 
patients benefitted from therapy. Due to the clinical hold of the fedratinib development programme, 
17.5% of patients discontinued treatment before the end of cycle 6. At inclusion, patients were 
required to be resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib as per investigators’ assessment and retrospectively, 
79 patients were identified as R/R or intolerant to ruxolitinib (cohort 1) using expert-based criteria.  
In both studies, the primary endpoint was spleen response rate defined as the proportion of subjects 
with ≥35% SVR from baseline to End of Cycle 6 measured by MRI/CT scan (with confirmation 4 weeks 
later in study EFC12153). 
Key secondary endpoint in these studies was symptom response rate defined as the proportion of 
subjects with ≥50% reduction in the total symptom score (TSS, average of the sum of the daily scores 
of all 6 items of the modified MFSAF - night sweats, pruritus, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, pain 
under ribs on left side, and bone or muscle pain) from baseline to end of cycle 6. 
In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) Bonferroni adjustment was used to test the primary hypothesis to 
compare the RR of each treatment arm to the placebo at a 2-sided 2.5% alpha level. A fixed sequence 
procedure was planned for the multiplicity considerations for each of the fedratinib arms (400 and 500 
mg) versus placebo at a 2-sided 2.5% alpha level, being Spleen response rate (Spleen RR), Symptom 
response rate (Symptom RR), Spleen RR of ≥25% SVR (RR25), Overall survival (OS), Progression-free 
survival (PFS). Thus, the overall alpha level for the primary endpoint (spleen RR) and the key 
secondary endpoints (symptom RR, RR25, OS, PFS) was maintained at a 5% level. 
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) HRQOL was assessed using EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D™) questionnaire (a 
standardised health-related QOL designed to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical 
and economic appraisal). In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-
Core 30 (QLQ-C30) (a self-administered questionnaire chosen as a cancer-specific instrument) was 
used. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The dose-finding studies provided support for the proposed posology of 400 mg/day. 
In the randomised placebo-controlled study ECF12153 (JAKARTA) in treatment naïve patients, the 
primary endpoint of spleen response rate was 36.5% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, 40.2% in the 
fedratinib 500 mg arm compared to 1.0% in the placebo arm. 
In the single arm study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) in ruxolitinib-treated patients (predominantly 
relapsed/refractory/intolerant), the primary endpoint of spleen response rate, was 30.9%. This rate is 
in the ITT population without using LOCF but considering all missing data as non-response, thus a 
more conservative estimate of the rate. When patients who received doses > 400 mg (up-titration) 
were excluded from the analysis a more conservative estimate for the spleen RR of 22.7% was 
obtained. 
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), the median (95% CI) percentage change in spleen volume at the End 
of Cycle 6 in the ITT Population with available baseline and EOC6 assessments, was -40.0% (-39.9, -
31.3) in the 400 mg arm, and -46.0% (-47.3, -37.3) in the 500 mg arm compared to +8.0% (+5.1, 
+15.5) in the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 161/170 
 
 
 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), the median (95% CI) percent change in spleen volume at End of 
Cycle 6 (ITT population without using the LOCF method) was -38% (−41.9, −26.9).  
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), taking into account the wide, overlapping confidence intervals for the 
difference in spleen RR between the 400 mg and 500 mg fedratinib arms and placebo, there was a 
consistent picture of similar difference across subgroups. The Spleen RR was also fairly consistent in 
the various subgroups, including in important baseline subgroups of interest in relation to disease 
characteristics such as myelofibrosis risk category and myelofibrosis subtype. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) a similar situation was observed. 
Similar Spleen RRs were observed between subjects in the 65 to 74 years age group and the smaller 
subgroup of subjects 75 to 84 years who received fedratinib 400 mg in Studies ECF12153 (JAKARTA) 
and ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) and these rates were consistent with those in the overall population. 
For the patients included in the primary analysis (i.e. treatment for 6 cycles, so 6 months), the time to 
spleen response was 3.0 - 3.5 months in the pivotal studies. 
In study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) the median treatment duration of treatment was approximately 60 
weeks and during the study, 11.1% (6/54) and 14.0% (8/57) of responders in the 400 and 500 mg 
arms, respectively, the response ended due to PD or death. This indicates that there was not a high 
rate of loss of response during this period.  
In Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), in subgroup analyses of Spleen RR by the subgroups ruxolitinib 
relapsed/refractory (n=65) and intolerant (n=14) (Cohort 1) the Spleen RR was approximately 30% in 
both subgroups.  
In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), the Symptom RR was 39.6% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, 34.1% in 
the fedratinib 500 mg arm compared to 8.2% in the placebo arm. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2), the Symptom RR was 25.8%. When patients who received doses > 
400 mg (up-titration) were excluded from the analysis a more conservative estimate for the Symptom 
RR of 21.5% was obtained. 
For individual symptoms in the MFSAF, in both pivotal studies (in both arms of ECF12153 (JAKARTA), 
the largest reductions in scores were recorded for pain under ribs on left side, night sweats and early 
satiety with median percent of changes (reduction) of approximately 50% to 80% with night sweats 
close to 80% in both studies. For abdominal discomfort and itching the median percent of changes 
were approximately in the range 44% to 50% and lowest for bone or muscle pain at approximately 
22% to 30%. 
In both studies there was an improvement from baseline in Health Related Quality of Life in both 
studies. In study ECF12153 (JAKARTA), improvements relative to baseline were reported for both 
fedratinib arms compared to disimprovement in the placebo arm. 
In study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) a moderate improvement was seen with no disimprovement from 
baseline. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
An important limitation to the efficacy data is the fact that both pivotal studies were terminated early 
due to reports of cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy which necessitated a clinical hold of the 
fedratinib studies. This impacted ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) more than Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) as not 
all patients reached the end of cycle 6, the treatment duration for evaluation of the primary endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 162/170 
 
 
 
There are insufficient long-term data to establish the median duration of response.  
A lack of direct comparison with ruxolitinib in Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) in JAK inhibitor naïve 
patients and the fact that Study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) in patients who had previously been treated 
with ruxolitinib was a single arm trial, are factors which hamper evaluation of the efficacy relative to 
other treatments. 
Small sizes of some subgroups limit interpretation of spleen RR in these subgroups. 
In Study EFC12153, in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, for male subjects the Spleen RR at 27.8% was 
lower than for females in whom it was 47.6%. This was not seen in the fedratinib 500 mg arm, in 
which the Spleen RR was 42.6% in male subjects and 36.1% in females. In study ARD 12181 
(JAKARTA2) the spleen RR was also lower in males at 24.5% than in females in whom it was 38.6% 
but with more overlap in the 95% confidence intervals. However further analysis could not establish 
that males will have a lower response to fedratinib in terms of spleen volume reduction than females. 
With respect to the clinical pharmacology, the warning on the combination of fedratinib with dual 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors like fluconazole and fluvoxamine, as well as on the effect of fedratinib 
on drug transporter activity should be confirmed by results of ongoing DDI studies on these situations 
which are acknowledged as recommendations. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting) were the most frequent AEs for fedratinib in 
the pivotal studies, with incidences of 44.8% to 67.5% based on the pooled data during the entire 
treatment duration. These occurred early upon treatment (within first week), were mostly grade 1 and 
2 and resolved with symptomatic treatment or dose modifications within 1-2 months. The following 
recommendation has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC that the “Administration with a high fat 
meal may reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting and thus fedratinib is recommended to be 
taken with food”. 
The cytopenias anaemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequent haematological AEs occurring 
in about 50% and 20% of patients, respectively. These AEs are expected based on the mechanism of 
action. Most events were grade 3 or higher (incidence >40% for anaemia and about 17-18% for 
thrombocytopenia), occurred within 3-4 months and were treated with transfusions or dose 
modifications. Frequencies of ≥grade 3 AEs anaemia were increased compared to placebo (400 mg 
dose: 30.2% vs 7.4% naïve population up to 6 cycles) but not for thrombocytopenia. Blood 
transfusions were common (about 60%) but appear comparable to placebo when adjusted for follow-
up time. The frequency of platelet transfusions was about 9% for patients on fedratinib compared to 
3% in the placebo group (up to 6 cycles). About 10% of patients had bleeding events associated with 
thrombocytopenia that required clinical intervention. There does not appear to be an increased risk in 
severe or SAEs compared to placebo. The incidence of ≥grade 3 AEs thrombocytopenia was 
numerically higher in pre-treated patients compared to naïve patients (400 mg: 21.6% vs 5.2% up to 
6 cycles across studies). Pre-treated patients also more frequently had low baseline platelet count 
(<100x109/L) compared to the naïve population. A recommendation has been added in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC that a “Complete blood counts should be obtained at baseline, periodically during treatment 
and as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Inrebic has not been studied in patients with a 
baseline platelet count < 50 x 109/L and ANC < 1.0 x 109/L.” 
Increase in transaminases (AST and ALT), mostly grade 1 or 2, were common. These are known 
events for JAK inhibitors. In addition, amylase and especially lipase increase was commonly observed 
with fedratinib treatment. The following warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC: 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 163/170 
 
 
 
“Patients should have their hepatic function monitored at baseline, at least monthly for the first 
3 months, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. After observed toxicity, patients 
should be monitored at least every 2 weeks until resolution.” 
Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were more common with the 500 mg dose compared to the 400 
mg dose (66.0% vs 47.9%) and more patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs (36.1% vs 
27.1%) within the naïve population. GI events appear dose-related based on exposure-safety 
relationship. 
The safety profile in the pre-treated population appears comparable to that of the naïve population, 
whereas quantitative differences (higher frequencies of some AEs) can be explained by the more 
advanced disease status.  
There was 1 case of hepatic encephalopathy (400 mg dose) and 7 potential cases of encephalopathy, 
including Wernicke’s, throughout the entire safety database (all receiving 500 mg fedratinib). One case 
was confirmed as WE. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
A contraindication in pregnancy is included in section 4.3 of the SmpC. 
The safety profile was largely comparable among the subgroups studied. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median duration of exposure in the pooled safety population was 36 weeks in the pooled 400 mg 
group and 60 weeks in the 500 mg group. For about one half of the patients in the key studies 
treatment was stopped due to early study termination, and treatment exposure is likely to be 
substantial longer in clinical practice with estimated median survival of 3.5 to 5.5 years. The limited 
long-term safety data is especially of relevance for AEs that might occur after long-term exposure, like 
secondary malignancies. This is reflected in the RMP as important missing information, and additional 
safety data up to 3 years will be available from the ongoing study FEDR-MF-002 in the pretreated 
population (please see RMP).  
The risk of encephalopathy, including Wernicke’s, is a serious AE of concern which was unexpected and 
resulted in the clinical hold of the fedratinib studies. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is an acute 
neurological disorder resulting from thiamine deficiency. The exact reason is unknown but does not 
appear to be the result of a direct interaction of fedratinib with the thiamine receptor based on 
preclinical data. Preclinical data do not suggest WE-like symptoms or central nervous system pathology 
upon administration of fedratinib, however, the preclinical models are not very predictive for humans 
because of low exposure levels. It is reassuring that there were no other safety signals in the studies 
indicative of neurological toxicities. Possibly, GI toxicities of fedratinib can attributed to thiamine 
deficiency in an otherwise vulnerable population. This can be manageable by thiamine monitoring and 
supplementation in case of early signs of insufficiency. Adequate measures are included in the SmPC. 
Further data will become available from the ongoing study FEDR-MF-002 which incorporated the 
proposed risk minimisation measures currently included in the SmPC.  
There was only one case meeting Hy’s law criteria, it is unclear whether there is an increased risk of 
hepatotoxic events in clinical practice as patients with transaminases ≥2.5 x ULN were excluded from 
the studies. In addition, there was one case of pancreatitis but patients with serum amylase and lipase 
>1.5 x ULN were excluded. These are included in the RMP and further followed through routine risk 
measurements which is acceptable. Dose recommendations and warnings have been included in the 
SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020

Fedratinib was not associated with an increased risk of severe infections, including viral reactivation, 
which is a potential risk with JAK inhibitors given the mechanism of action. The frequency in long-term 
use is uncertain and severe infections is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Data on secondary malignancies is limited due to lack of long-term data. This is included in the RMP.  
No information is available on functional CYP3A4 polymorphisms, e.g. CYP3A4*22, and whether a dose 
reduction would be needed as e.g. recommended for the combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
The applicant commits to submit a pharmacogenetic sub-report on the effect of CYP3A4*22 as 
investigated in the ongoing study FEDR-MF-002. 
No data is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. An ongoing study in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is included in the RMP which will provide data on this subject. In addition, 
an interaction study is planned to investigate the potential effect of fedratinib as perpetrator on a 
number of drug transporter proteins (P-gp and others), in order to evaluate potential relevance of such 
interactions.  
No teratogenic effects were observed in non-clinical studies, however the exposure to fedratinib in 
these studies was well below the clinical exposure and the relevance of these studies for human safety 
is therefore limited. In line with other JAK inhibitors a contraindication for pregnancy is included in the 
SmPC. 
A satisfactory risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the drug product 
has been provided. No potential risk for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the product has been 
identified.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The reduction in spleen volume and associated symptoms of abdominal discomfort and pain, early 
satiety achieved with treatment with fedratinib are of major clinical relevance in treating patients with 
myelofibrosis. Similarly, alleviation of debilitating symptoms such as night sweats and pruritus also 
have a major impact on the disease burden of MF.  
Despite the uncertainties due to the early termination of the studies, the available data are considered 
sufficient to show that clinically relevant effects on the phenomena caused by myelofibrosis have been 
obtained and the reduction in disease burden achieved can be viewed as being of considerable benefit 
to the patient.  
There is a clear and large absolute effect of fedratinib in reducing splenomegaly and MF symptoms as 
seen in the placebo-controlled RCT. Apart from ruxolitinib, there is no currently approved treatment for 
myelofibrosis which results in the same reduction in spleen size/volume, with a spleen RR of 36.5% as 
seen in JAK inhibitor naïve patients in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA). This response rate is in the same 
order of magnitude as that of ~42% reported for a very similar primary endpoint in JAK inhibitor naïve 
patients in the ruxolitinib pivotal study (COMFORT-I).   
Absence of a control arm in study ARD12181 (JAKARTA2) hampers evaluation of the efficacy relative to 
other available treatments in patients relapsed after or refractory to treatment with ruxolitinib but the 
spleen and symptom response rates seen in this study are clinically relevant although lower (the 
spleen RR was 22.7% and the Symptom RR was 21.5% when 8 and 4 patients respectively who 
received doses > 400 mg with up-titration were excluded from these analyses) than in JAK inhibitor 
naive patients treated with 400 mg/day in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) (spleen RR 36%, symptom RR 
40%).  
In Study EFC12153 (JAKARTA), in the fedratinib 400 mg arm, for male subjects the Spleen RR (rate of 
≥ 35% spleen volume reduction at EOC6) at 27.8% (95% CI:15.8, 39.7) was lower than for females in 
whom it was 47.6% (95% CI: 32.5, 62.7) and in Study ARD2181 (JAKARTA2) it was 24.5% (95% CI 
12.9, 36.1) in males and 38.6% (95% CI 24.2, 53.0) in females but with more overlap in the 95% 
confidence intervals. The mean changes of spleen volume from baseline to EOC6 for males and 
females respectively showed reductions in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) of 42% vs 46% with fedratinib 
500 mg, 26% vs 42% with fedratinib 400 mg and in ARD12181 this was 33% and 33% for both males 
and females (apparently without exclusion of patients who had had dose up-titration). Overall, from 
currently available information and analyses it is not considered established that males will have a 
lower response to fedratinib in terms of spleen volume reduction than females. 
While there is uncertainty concerning the duration of the spleen response, it can be taken into 
consideration that in study EFC12153 (JAKARTA) the median treatment duration was approximately 60 
Assessment report  
EMA/705612/2020  
Page 167/170 
 
 
 
 
weeks and during the study, 11.1% (6/54) and 14.0% (8/57) of responders in the 400 and 500 mg 
arms, respectively, the response ended due to PD or death. During the study there was not a high rate 
of loss of response.  
The situation is comparable to that of the ruxolitinib MAA for which the median duration of exposure in 
all three pooled safety populations was around 10 months (Jakavi EPAR). In the combined pivotal 
studies, 75% of the patients in the ruxolitinib arms were still receiving the randomised treatment at 
data cut-off. Progression-free survival, overall survival and leukaemia-free survival data for ruxolitinib 
became available post-approval. For the new study (FEDR-MF-002), OS data will be collected and 
made available to CHMP. This study is listed as a Category 3 study in the RMP. 
These efficacy results need to be weighed against the safety profile, which is characterised by GI 
events (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting) and the cytopenias anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Events are 
manageable and individual AEs infrequently led to treatment discontinuations. However, overall 
treatment discontinuation is high indicating a non-negligible safety profile of fedratinib. The safety data 
support the recommended 400 mg dose based on better tolerability. Anaemia is among the cardinal 
features of MF, associated with inferior quality of life and poor prognosis of MF and many patients 
become RBC-transfusion dependent. Due to the increased risk of anaemia by fedratinib, the burden of 
anaemia remains for the MF patient.  
A key serious safety concern of fedratinib appears to be Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) (1.3% of the 
patients; 1 WE confirmed, 6 potential WE, all with 500 mg), which results from thiamine deficiency. 
When recognised early, low thiamine levels are manageable with parenteral thiamine and 
discontinuation of fedratinib. The frequent GI events appear to have contributed to thiamine deficiency 
in a vulnerable population. The incidence of potential WE’s might be lower for the recommended 400 
mg dose. Further, risk minimisation measures like prophylactic anti-emetics and intake with high food 
may reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting and thus the contribution to low thiamine levels. 
Given the known class effects of other marketed JAK inhibitors, concern for exposure to fedratinib 
during pregnancy has been established. Fedratinib should be contraindicated during pregnancy, in line 
with other JAK inhibitors.  
Long-term safety data is limited with fedratinib. However, long-term exposure is available for JAK 
inhibitors in general. Class effects for JAK inhibitors and relevant for the target population include risk 
of severe infections and secondary malignancies. These are of relevance as transformation to acute 
myeloid leukaemia as well as infections are among the important disease-related events in MF that 
may lead to death.  
Additional long-term safety data will become available from study FEDR-MF-002 in the ruxolitinib 
pretreated population. This study will also provide some data on the impact of risk minimisation 
measures in the SmPC on frequent GI events. 
The safety profile of fedratinib partly overlaps with that of ruxolitinib due to JAK2-mediated effects, but 
also shows differences due to the lack of JAK1 inhibition. Type of GI events differ and appear more 
common with fedratinib, whereas haematological events might occur at a lower rate based on indirect 
comparisons.  
In conclusion, fedratinib offers a treatment alternative to ruxolitinib for the JAK-inhibitor naïve 
population. In addition, fedratinib offers the option of a targeted therapy for patients previously treated 
with ruxolitinib.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The improvement in spleen volume and disease-related symptoms are clinically relevant in the target 
populations of naive and ruxolitinib-pretreated patients with MF in the context of an acceptable safety 
profile.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Inrebic (fedratinib) for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms 
in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential 
thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis, who are Janus Associated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor naïve or have been 
treated with ruxolitinib is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Inrebic is favourable in the following indication: 
“Inrebic is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis, post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis, who are Janus Associated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor naïve or have been treated with 
ruxolitinib”.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that fedratinib is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union has not been authorised previously in the European Union.

Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax. Appropriate medical 
treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction 
following administration of the vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. Subsequent doses of 
the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of 
Spikevax. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose (see section 4.8).  
Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal 
cases have been observed. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.  
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Capillary leak syndrome flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported in the first days after 
vaccination with Spikevax. Healthcare professionals should be aware of signs and symptoms of CLS 
to promptly recognise and treat the condition. In individuals with a medical history of CLS, planning 
of vaccination should be made in collaboration with appropriate medical experts.   
Duration of protection 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical studies. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, 
vaccination with Spikevax may not protect all vaccine recipients.  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
High-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine can be concomitantly administered with Spikevax.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax during the 
second and third trimester has not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on 
pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no 
increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development 
(see section 5.3). Spikevax can be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the 
breastfeeding woman to Spikevax is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed 
newborns/infants. Spikevax can be used during breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Spikevax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Adults  
The safety of Spikevax was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States involving 30 351 participants 18 years of 
age and older who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=15 185) or placebo (n=15 166) 
(NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 
18-95); 22 831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7 520 (24.8%) of participants 
were 65 years of age and older.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), 
headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), 
axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness 
(10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days 
after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.  
Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence 
of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting 
and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax in adolescents were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study with multiple parts conducted in the United States. 
The first portion of the study involved 3 726 participants 12 through 17 years of age who received at 
least one dose of Spikevax (n=2 486) or placebo (n=1 240) (NCT04649151). Demographic 
characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax and those who received 
placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were injection site pain 
(97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema 
(26%), and fever (14%).   
This study transitioned to an open-label Phase 2/3 study in which 1 346 participants 12 years through 
17 years of age received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 5 months after the second dose of the 
primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 years through 11 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax in children were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 two-part randomised, 
observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). Part 1 is an 
open-label phase of the study for safety, dose selection, and immunogenicity and included 
380 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax. 
Part 2 is the placebo-controlled phase for safety and included 4 016 participants 6 years through 
11 years of age who received at least one dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax (n=3 012) or placebo (n=1 004). 
No participants in Part 1 participated in Part 2. Demographic characteristics were similar among 
participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 6 years through 11 years of age following 
administration of the primary series (in Part 2) were injection site pain (98.4%), fatigue (73.1%), 
headache (62.1%), myalgia (35.3%), chills (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), axillary 
swelling/tenderness (27.0%), fever (25.7%), injection site erythema (24.0%), injection site swelling 
(22.3%), and arthralgia (21.3%).   
The study protocol was amended to include an open-label booster dose phase that included 
1 294 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 
6 months after the second dose of the primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified 
in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax was conducted in the United States and Canada. 
This study involved 10 390 participants 6 months through 11 years of age who received at least one 
dose of Spikevax (n=7 798) or placebo (n=2 592). 
8 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study enrolled children in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 
6 months through 23 months. This paediatric study involved 6 388 participants 6 months through 
5 years of age who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=4 791) or placebo (n=1 597). 
Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax and those who 
received placebo. 
In this clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 6 months through 23 months of age 
following administration of the primary series were irritability/crying (81.5%), pain at the injection 
site (56.2%), sleepiness (51.1%), loss of appetite (45.7%), fever (21.8%), swelling at the injection site 
(18.4%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (12.2%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 24 through 36 months of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (76.8%), irritability/crying (71.0%), sleepiness (49.7%), 
loss of appetite (42.4%), fever (26.1%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), swelling at the 
injection site (15.7%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (11.5%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 37 months through 5 years of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (83.8%), fatigue (61.9%), headache (22.9%), myalgia 
(22.1%), fever (20.9%), chills (16.8%), nausea/vomiting (15.2%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(14.3%), arthralgia (12.8%), erythema at the injection site (9.5%), and swelling at the injection site 
(8.2%).

*Lymphadenopathy was captured as axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side as the injection site. Other lymph nodes 
(e.g., cervical, supraclavicular) were affected in some cases. 
† Observed in the paediatric population (6 months to 5 years of age). 
‡ Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by three participants in the 
Spikevax group and one participant in the placebo group. Onset in the vaccine group participants was 22 days, 28 days, 
and 32 days after Dose 2.  
§ Abdominal pain was observed in the paediatric population (6 to 11 years of age): 0.2% in the Spikevax group and 0% in the 
placebo group. 
¶ Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset (within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to 
approximately two weeks after vaccination). 
# Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
♠ Median time to onset was 9 days after the first injection, and 11 days after the second injection. Median duration was 
4 days after the first injection, and 4 days after the second injection. 
♥ There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological 
fillers. The onset of swelling was reported on Day 1 and Day 3, respectively, relative to day of vaccination.  
The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving Spikevax, that were seropositive for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at 
baseline.  
Adults (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax are evaluated in an 
ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax vaccine primary series. In an 
open-label phase of this study, 167 of those participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 
50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited 
10 
 
 
 
adverse reaction profile for the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was similar to that after the 
second dose in the primary series. 
Spikevax (original) in solid organ transplant recipients   
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth dose for mRNA vaccines 
and third dose for non-mRNA vaccines).  
Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Spikevax (original). There were no 
unexpected safety findings. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Spikevax. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the 
second dose, there were about 1.316 (95% CI: 1.299, 1.333) extra cases of myocarditis in 12 to 
29 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days 
after the second dose, there were 1.88 (95% CI: 0.956, 2.804) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 to 
24 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
Spikevax (elasomeran) contains mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA encodes for 
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad 
repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. After 
intramuscular injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid 
nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. 
The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus

macrophages. The expressed, membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by 
immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralising 
antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
The adult study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study 
(NCT04470427) that excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received 
immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza 
vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of Spikevax. Participants 
were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products 
or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or Spikevax. 
A total of 30 351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development 
of COVID-19 disease.  
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 
28 207 subjects who received either Spikevax (n=14 134) or placebo (n=14 073) and had a negative 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 
79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified 
as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of -7 
to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in 
the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 
(corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days). 
COVID-19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and 
by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented 
in Table 4.

*Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
** CI not adjusted for multiplicity. Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an interim

Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group 
compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group. Of the 30 participants with severe 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the 
remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤ 93% 
on room air).  
The vaccine efficacy of Spikevax to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days after Dose 2 
was 93.6% (95% CI: 88.6, 96.5).  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity in adults – after booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax are evaluated in an 
ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received 
two doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax vaccine as primary series. In an 
open label phase, 149 of those participants (Per Protocol Set) received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 
50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose in the primary series. A single 
booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 
12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 28 days after 
the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) when compared 
28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose. 
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine in adults  
Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous booster with Spikevax were studied in an 
investigator-initiated study with 154 participants. The minimum time interval between primary series 
using a vector based or RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and booster injection with Spikevax was 
12 weeks (range: 12 weeks to 20.9 weeks). The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 1 prior to administration and at Day 15 and Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster 
response was demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination. 
Only short-term immunogenicity data are available; long-term protection and immunological memory 
are currently unknown. 
Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) in the UK 
COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed immunology. Participants were 
adults aged 30 years or older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well-controlled co-morbidities 
were permitted), who had received two doses of either Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca 
(first dose in December 2020, January 2021 or February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second 
dose by the time of enrolment. Spikevax boosted antibody and neutralising responses and was well 
tolerated regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting in this study was 100 micrograms. 
Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were assessed on 
Day 28 after the booster dose. 
Pre-boost and post-boost neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in adults 
Results of the pseudovirus neutralisation assay (PsVNA) against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant 
determined pre-booster and on Day 29 post booster showed that administration of a booster dose of 
Spikevax (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) in adults induced a 17-fold rise in neutralising antibodies against 
the Delta variant compared with pre-booster levels (GMFR = 17.28; 95% CI: 14.38, 20.77; n=295).   
Clinical efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The adolescent study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical 
study (NCT04649151) to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in adolescents 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 to 17 years of age. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded 
from the study. A total of 3 732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or 
saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis was performed in 3 181 participants who received 2 doses of either 
Spikevax (n=2 139) or placebo (n=1 042) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per 
Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were 
no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.   
There were zero symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Spikevax group and 4 symptomatic COVID-19 
cases in the placebo group.  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age – after Spikevax primary vaccination  
A non-inferiority analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 
28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in the per-protocol immunogenicity subsets of adolescents aged 
12 through 17 (n=340) in the adolescent study and in participants aged 18 through 25 (n=296) in the 
adult study. Subjects had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the neutralising antibody titres in adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.24). The difference in 
seroresponse rate was 0.2% (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI 
for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 years through 17 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster 
dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study was to infer 
efficacy of the booster dose in participants 12 years through 17 years of age by comparing 
post-booster immune responses (Day 29) to those obtained post-dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in the adult study. Efficacy of the 50 microgram Spikevax 
booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (nAb geometric mean concentration 
[GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet prespecified noninferiority criteria (for both GMC and 
SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 microgram Spikevax primary 
series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal adult efficacy study. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 12 years through 17 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 5 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 257 booster dose participants in this study and a 
random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study (ages ≥18 to ≤25 years) who previously 
completed a primary vaccination series of two doses 1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of 
participants included in the analysis population had no serologic or virologic evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
The GMR of the adolescent booster dose Day 29 GMC compared with young adults: Day 57 GMR 
was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.5, 5.8), meeting the noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI >0.667 
(1/1.5); point estimate ≥0.8); the SRR difference was 0.7% (95% CI: -0.8, 2.4), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference >-10%). 
In the 257 participants, pre-booster (booster dose-Day 1) nAb GMC was 400.4 (95% CI: 370.0, 
433.4); on BD-Day 29, the GMC was 7 172.0 (95% CI: 6 610.4, 7 781.4). Post-booster booster 
dose-Day 29 GMC increased approximately 18-fold from pre-booster GMC, demonstrating the 
potency of the booster dose to adolescents. The SRR was 100 (95% CI: 98.6, 100.0). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus 
enabling the inference of vaccine efficacy from the adult study.

Clinical efficacy in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
The paediatric study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical 
study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in children aged 6 years through 
11 years in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). Participants with a known history of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. A total of 4 011 participants were randomised 
3:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 10 November 2021 was performed in 3 497 participants who received two doses (0.25 mL at 0 
and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=2 644) or placebo (n=853) and had a negative baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax and those 
who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.  
There were three COVID-19 cases (0.1%) in the Spikevax group and four COVID-19 cases (0.5%) in 
the placebo group. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
An analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 28 days after 
Dose 2 was conducted in a subset of children aged 6 years through 11 years (n=319) in the paediatric 
study and in participants aged 18 through 25 years (n=295) in the adult study. Subjects had no 
immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The GMR of the 
neutralising antibody titres in children 6 years through 11 years of age compared to the 18- to 
25-year-olds was 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.1% (95% 
CI: -1.9, 2.1). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of 
the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study is to infer efficacy of the 
booster dose in participants 6 years through 11 years of age by comparing post-booster dose immune 
responses (Day 29) to those obtained post dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) in that study, where 93% efficacy was demonstrated. Efficacy of the 25 microgram 
Spikevax booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (neutralising antibody [nAb] 
geometric mean concentration [GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet pre-specified non-inferiority 
criteria (for both GMC and SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 
100 microgram Spikevax primary series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal 
adult efficacy trial. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 6 years through 11 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 95 booster dose participants in 6 years through 
11-year-olds and a random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study who received two 
doses 1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of participants included in the analysis population had 
no serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and 
prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
In the 95 participants, on booster dose-Day 29, the GMC was 5 847.5 (95% CI: 4 999.6, 6 839.1). The 
SRR was 100 (95% CI: 95.9, 100.0). Serum nAb levels for children 6 years through 11 years in the 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset with pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 negative status and the 
comparison with those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) were studied. The GMR of booster 
dose Day 29 GMC compared to young adults Day 57 GMC was 4.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 5.0), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI > 0.667); the SRR difference was 0.7% 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(95% CI: -3.5, 2.4), meeting the noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference 
>-10%). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus enabling 
the inference of booster dose vaccine efficacy. The brisk recall response evident within 4 weeks of 
booster dosing is evidence of the robust priming induced by the Spikevax primary series. 
Neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in children 6 years through 11 years of 
age  
Serum samples of the per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n=134) of the ongoing paediatric study 
obtained at baseline and on Day 57 were tested in a PsVNA based on the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.   
In children 6 years through 11 years of age, the GMFR from baseline to D57 was 81.77 (95% CI: 
70.38, 95.00) for the Delta variant (measured by PsVNA). Furthermore, 99.3% of children met the 
definition of seroresponse. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and 
efficacy of Spikevax in healthy children 6 months through 11 years of age. The study enrolled children 
in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 6 months through 23 months. 
A descriptive efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 21 February 2022 was performed in 5 476 participants 6 months through 5 years of age who 
received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=4 105) or placebo (n=1 371) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (referred to as the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy). Between 
participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences 
in demographics.  
The median length of follow-up for efficacy post-Dose 2 was 71 days for participants 2 years through 
5 years of age and 68 days for participants 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Vaccine efficacy in this study was observed during the period when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant 
was the predominant variant in circulation. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) in Part 2 for the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy for COVID-19 cases 14 days or 
more after dose 2 using the “COVID-19 P301 case definition” (i.e., the definition employed in the 
pivotal adult efficacy study) was 46.4% (95% CI: 19.8, 63.8) for children 2 years through 5 years of 
age and 31.5% (95% CI: -27.7, 62.0) for children 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Immunogenicity in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
For children aged 2 years through 5 years of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb responses in this Part 2 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 264; 25 micrograms) to those of young adults (n = 295; 
100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.014 (95% CI: 0.881, 1.167), meeting the noninferiority 
success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point estimate ≥ 0.8). The geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 for these children was 183.3 (95% CI: 164.03, 
204.91). The difference in seroresponse rates (SRR) between the children and young adults was -0.4% 
(95% CI: -2.7%, 1.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the SRR difference > -10%).  
For infants and toddlers from 6 months through 23 months of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb 
responses in this Part 2 per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 230; 25 micrograms) to those of 
young adults (n = 295; 100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.115, 1.470), 
meeting the noninferiority success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point 
estimate ≥ 0.8). The difference in SRR rates between the infants/toddlers and young adults was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -1.0%, 2.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the seroresponse rate difference > -10%). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accordingly, the prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met for 
both age groups, allowing efficacy of 25 micrograms to be inferred in both children 2 years through 
5 years and infants and toddlers aged 6 months through 23 months (Tables 5 and 6).

LLOQ. Values greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) are replaced by the ULOQ if 
actual values are not available. 
a The log-transformed antibody levels are analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with the group variable (participants 6 months through 5 years of age and young adults) as fixed effect. 
The resulted LS means, difference of LS means, and 95% CI are back transformed to the original scale 
for presentation. 
b Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMC ratio is greater than 
0.67, with a point estimate of >0.8 and the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for difference in 
seroresponse rate is greater than -10%, with a point estimate of >-5%. 
c Final geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMC) in AU/mL were determined using SARS-CoV-2 
microneutralisation assay.  
d Seroresponse due to vaccination specific to SARS-CoV-2 RVP neutralizing antibody concentration at a 
subject level is defined in protocol as a change from below LLOQ to equal or above 4 x LLOQ, or at 
least a 4-fold rise if baseline is equal to or above LLOQ. Seroresponse 95% CI is calculated using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. 
e Difference in seroresponse rate 95% CI is calculated using the Miettinen-Nurminen (score) confidence limits. 
Immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose. 
Immunogenicity in the study was assessed by measurement of neutralising antibodies against 
pseudovirus expressing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain at 1 month after Dose 2, Dose 3, 
booster dose and up to 12 months from the last dose in Part A, and up to 6 months from booster dose 
in Part B.  
Three doses of Spikevax (original) induced enhanced neutralising antibody titres compared to 
pre-dose 1 and post-dose 2. A higher proportion of SOT participants who had received three doses 
achieved seroresponse compared to participants who had received two doses. The neutralising 
antibody levels observed in SOT liver participants who had received three doses was comparable to 
the post-dose 2 responses observed in the immunocompetent, baseline SARS-CoV-2-negative adult 
participants. The neutralising antibody responses continued to be numerically lower post-dose 3 in 
SOT kidney participants compared to SOT liver participants. The neutralising levels observed one 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
month after Dose 3 persisted through six months with antibody levels maintained at 26-fold higher and 
seroresponse rate at 67% compared to baseline. 
A fourth (booster) dose of Spikevax (original) enhanced neutralising antibody response in 
SOT participants compared to post-dose 3, regardless of the previous vaccines received [mRNA-1273 
(Moderna), BNT162b2 or any mRNA-containing combination]; however, SOT kidney participants 
had numerically lower neutralising antibody responses compared to SOT liver participants. 
Elderly 
Spikevax was assessed in individuals 6 months of age and older, including 3 768 subjects 65 years of 
age and older. The efficacy of Spikevax was consistent between elderly (≥65 years) and younger adult 
subjects (18-64 years).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
Spikevax in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the 
human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and 
transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated 
partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to 
humans is low. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of 
the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies 
were not performed. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of 
mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Spikevax was 
administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to 
mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal 
animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and 
offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo 
foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of Spikevax vaccine 
placental transfer or excretion in milk.

age have not yet been established. No data are available.  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age. 
Method of administration  
The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the 
upper arm.  
Do not administer this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 
For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax (original). Appropriate 
medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic 
reaction following administration of the vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. Subsequent doses of 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 should not be given to those who have experienced 
anaphylaxis to a prior dose of Spikevax (original). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose (see section 4.8).  
Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal 
cases have been observed.   
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.  
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Capillary leak syndrome flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported in the first days after 
vaccination with Spikevax (original). Healthcare professionals should be aware of signs and symptoms 
of CLS to promptly recognise and treat the condition. In individuals with a medical history of CLS, 
planning of vaccination should be made in collaboration with appropriate medical experts.   
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical studies. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with all vaccines, vaccination with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients.  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 with other vaccines has not 
been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 during 
pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax 
(original) during the second and third trimester has not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are 
presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or 
post-natal development (see section 5.3). Since differences between products are confined to the spike 
protein sequence, and there are no clinically meaningful differences in reactogenicity, Spikevax 
bivalent Original/ Omicron BA.1 can be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 during 
breastfeeding.

However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the 
breastfeeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used during 
breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines.

Summary of the safety profile 
Adults  
The safety of Spikevax (original) was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, placebo-
controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States involving 30 351 participants 
18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=15 185) or placebo 
(n=15 166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years 
(range 18-95); 22 831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7 520 (24.8%) of 
participants were 65 years of age and older. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), 
headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), 
axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness 
(10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days 
after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.  
Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence 
of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting 
and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in adolescents were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study with multiple parts conducted in the United States. 
The first portion of the study involved 3 726 participants 12 through 17 years of age who received at 
least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=2 486) or placebo (n=1 240) (NCT04649151). Demographic 
characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who 
received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were injection site pain 
(97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema 
(26%), and fever (14%).   
This study transitioned to an open-label Phase 2/3 study in which 1 346 participants 12 years through 
17 years of age received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 5 months after the second dose of the 
primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified in the open-label portion of the study.

Children 6 years through 11 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in children were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 two-part 
randomised, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). 
Part 1 is an open-label phase of the study for safety, dose selection, and immunogenicity and included 
380 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax 
(original). Part 2 is the placebo-controlled phase for safety and included 4 016 participants 6 years 
through 11 years of age who received at least one dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax (original) (n=3 012) or 
placebo (n=1 004). No participants in Part 1 participated in Part 2. Demographic characteristics were 
similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 6 years through 11 years of age following 
administration of the primary series (in Part 2) were injection site pain (98.4%), fatigue (73.1%), 
headache (62.1%), myalgia (35.3%), chills (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), axillary 
swelling/tenderness (27.0%), fever (25.7%), injection site erythema (24.0%), injection site swelling 
(22.3%), and arthralgia (21.3%).   
The study protocol was amended to include an open-label booster dose phase that included 
1 294 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received a booster dose of Spikevax (original) 
at least 6 months after the second dose of the primary series. No additional adverse reactions were 
identified in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 months through 5 years of age  
An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) was conducted in the United States and 
Canada. This study involved 10 390 participants 6 months through 11 years of age who received at 
least one dose of Spikevax (n=7 798) or placebo (n=2 592).  
The study enrolled children in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 
6 months through 23 months. This paediatric study involved 6 388 participants 6 months through 
5 years of age who received at least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=4 791) or placebo (n=1 597). 
Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and 
those who received placebo.  
In this clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 6 months through 23 months of age 
following administration of the primary series were irritability/crying (81.5%), pain at the injection 
site (56.2%), sleepiness (51.1%), loss of appetite (45.7%), fever (21.8%), swelling at the injection site 
(18.4%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (12.2%).  
The adverse reactions in participants 24 through 36 months of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (76.8%), irritability/crying (71.0%), sleepiness (49.7%), 
loss of appetite (42.4%), fever (26.1%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), swelling at the 
injection site (15.7%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (11.5%).  
The adverse reactions in participants 37 months through 5 years of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (83.8%), fatigue (61.9%), headache (22.9%), myalgia 
(22.1%), fever (20.9%), chills (16.8%), nausea/vomiting (15.2%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(14.3%), arthralgia (12.8%), erythema at the injection site (9.5%), and swelling at the injection site 
(8.2%).

*Lymphadenopathy was captured as axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side as the injection site. Other lymph nodes 
(e.g., cervical, supraclavicular) were affected in some cases. 
† Observed in the paediatric population (6 months to 5 years of age). 
‡ Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by three participants in the 
Spikevax (original) group and one participant in the placebo group. Onset in the vaccine group 
participants was 22 days, 28 days, and 32 days after Dose 2.  
§ Abdominal pain was observed in the paediatric population (6 to 11 years of age): 0.2% in the Spikevax (original) group and 
0% in the placebo group. 
¶ Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset (within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to 
approximately two weeks after vaccination). 
# Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
♠ Median time to onset was 9 days after the first injection, and 11 days after the second injection. Median duration was 
4 days after the first injection, and 4 days after the second injection. 
♥ There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological 
fillers. The onset of swelling was reported on Day 1 and Day 3, respectively, relative to day of vaccination.  
The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving Spikevax (original), that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.  
Adults (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine primary series. In an 
open-label phase of this study, 167 of those participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 
50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited 
adverse reaction profile for the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was similar to that after the 
second dose in the primary series. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 
18 years of age and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the 
Spikevax (original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the Spikevax 
(original) booster given as a second booster dose. The frequency of adverse reactions after 
immunisation with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 was also similar or lower relative to that 
of a first booster dose of Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) and relative to the second dose of the 
Spikevax (original) primary series (100 micrograms). The safety profile of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (median follow-up period of 113 days) was similar to the safety profile of 
Spikevax (original) (median follow up period of 127 days). 
Spikevax (original) in solid organ transplant recipients   
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth dose for mRNA vaccines 
and third dose for non-mRNA vaccines).  
Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Spikevax (original). There were no 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unexpected safety findings. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax (original) is highest in younger 
males (see section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Spikevax (original). One study showed that in a period of 7 days 
after the second dose, there were about 1.316 (95% CI: 1.299, 1.333) extra cases of myocarditis in 12 
to 29 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 
28 days after the second dose, there were 1.88 (95% CI: 0.956, 2.804) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 
to 24 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
Spikevax (elasomeran) and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (elasomeran/imelasomeran) 
both contain mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA encodes for the full-length 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain 
(S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. After intramuscular injection, cells 
at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering 
the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. The delivered mRNA does not enter 
the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly 
by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The expressed, membrane-bound spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and 
B-cell responses to generate neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. 
Clinical efficacy 
Immunogenicity in adults – after Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster dose (0.5 mL, 
25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
booster dose are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 18 years of age 
and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the Spikevax 
(original) 50 microgram booster dose.

Study P205 Part G evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 when administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously received 
2 doses of Spikevax (original) (100 microgram) as a primary series and a booster dose of Spikevax 
(original) (50 micrograms) at least 3 months prior to enrolment. In P205 Part F, study participants 
received Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) as a second booster dose and the Part F group serves as 
the within-study, non-contemporaneous comparator group for Part G in the comparison between the 
two booster vaccines, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax (original), when 
administered as second booster doses.  
In this study, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the primary immunogenicity set 
which includes participants with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (pre-booster). In 
the primary analysis, the original SARS-CoV-2 estimated neutralising antibody geometric mean titre 
(GMT) and corresponding 95% CI was 6 422.3 (5 990.1, 6 885.7) and 5 286.6 (4 887.1, 5 718.9) 
28 days after the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax (original) booster doses, 
respectively. These GMTs represent the ratio between response of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 versus Spikevax (original) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain. 
The GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.22 (1.08, 1.37) meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority 
(lower bound of 97.5% CI ≥0.67).  
The estimated Day 29 neutralising antibody GMTs against Omicron, BA.1 were 2 479.9 (2 264.5, 
2 715.8) and 1 421.2 (1 283.0, 1 574.4) in the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax 
(original) booster groups, respectively, and the GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04), which met the 
pre-specified superiority criterion (lower bound of CI >1).  
Three-month antibody persistence of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster vaccine 
against COVID-19 
Participants in Study P205 Part G were sequentially enrolled to receive 50 micrograms of Spikevax 
(original) (n = 376) or Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (n = 437) as second booster doses. In 
participants with no pre-booster incidence of SARS-CoV-2, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
elicited Omicron-BA.1-neutralising antibody titres (observed GMT) that were significantly higher 
(964.4 [834.4, 1 114.7]) than those of Spikevax (original) (624.2 [533.1, 730.9]) and similar between 
boosters against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 at three months. 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
The adult study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study 
(NCT04470427) that excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received 
immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza 
vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of Spikevax (original). 
Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of 
blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or 
Spikevax (original). 
A total of 30 351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development 
of COVID-19 disease.  
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 
28 207 subjects who received either Spikevax (original) (n=14 134) or placebo (n=14 073) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 
79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified 
as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of –7 
to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in 
the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 
(corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days).

*Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
** CI not adjusted for multiplicity. Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an interim 
analysis based on less COVID-19 cases, not reported here. 
Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group 
compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group. Of the 30 participants with severe 
disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the 
remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤ 93% 
on room air).  
The vaccine efficacy of Spikevax (original) to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection (determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days 
after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% CI: 88.6, 96.5).  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity in adults – after booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine as primary series. In 
an open-label phase, 149 of those participants (Per Protocol Set) received a single booster dose 
(0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose in the primary series. A 
single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
28 days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) 
when compared 28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose.

Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous booster with Spikevax (original) were studied in an 
investigator-initiated study with 154 participants. The minimum time interval between primary series 
using a vector-based or RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and booster injection with Spikevax (original) 
was 12 weeks (range: 12 weeks to 20.9 weeks). The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 1 prior to administration and at Day 15 and Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster 
response was demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination. 
Only short-term immunogenicity data are available; long-term protection and immunological memory 
are currently unknown. 
Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) in the UK 
COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed immunology. Participants were 
adults aged 30 years or older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well-controlled co-morbidities 
were permitted), who had received two doses of either Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca (first 
dose in December 2020, January 2021 or February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second dose 
by the time of enrolment. Spikevax (original) boosted antibody and neutralising responses and was 
well tolerated regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 28 after the booster dose. 
Pre-boost and post-boost neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in adults 
Results of the pseudovirus neutralisation assay (PsVNA) against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant 
determined pre-booster and on Day 29 post-booster showed that administration of a booster dose of 
Spikevax (original) (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) in adults induced a 17-fold rise in neutralising 
antibodies against the Delta variant compared with pre-booster levels (GMFR = 17.28; 95% CI: 14.38, 
20.77; n=295).   
Clinical efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The adolescent study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical 
study (NCT04649151) to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
excluded from the study. A total of 3 732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of 
Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis was performed in 3 181 participants who received 2 doses of either 
Spikevax (original) (n=2 139) or placebo (n=1 042) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status 
in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received 
placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.   
There were zero symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Spikevax (original) group and 4 symptomatic 
COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age – after Spikevax primary vaccination 
A non-inferiority analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 
28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in the per-protocol immunogenicity subsets of adolescents aged 
12 through 17 (n=340) in the adolescent study and in participants aged 18 through 25 (n=296) in the 
adult study. Subjects had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the neutralising antibody titres in adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.24). The difference in 
seroresponse rate was 0.2% (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI 
for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 years through 17 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster 
dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study was to infer 
efficacy of the booster dose in participants 12 years through 17 years of age by comparing 
post-booster immune responses (Day 29) to those obtained post-dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in the adult study. Efficacy of the 50 microgram Spikevax 
booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (nAb geometric mean concentration 
[GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet prespecified noninferiority criteria (for both GMC and 
SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 microgram Spikevax primary 
series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal adult efficacy study. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 12 years through 17 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 5 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 257 booster dose participants in this study and a 
random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study (ages ≥18 to ≤25 years) who previously 
completed a primary vaccination series of two doses 1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of 
participants included in the analysis population had no serologic or virologic evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
The GMR of the adolescent booster dose Day 29 GMC compared with young adults: Day 57 GMR 
was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.5, 5.8), meeting the noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI >0.667 
(1/1.5); point estimate ≥0.8); the SRR difference was 0.7% (95% CI: -0.8, 2.4), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference >-10%). 
In the 257 participants, pre-booster (booster dose-Day 1) nAb GMC was 400.4 (95% CI: 370.0, 
433.4); on BD-Day 29, the GMC was 7 172.0 (95% CI: 6 610.4, 7 781.4). Post-booster booster 
dose-Day 29 GMC increased approximately 18-fold from pre-booster GMC, demonstrating the 
potency of the booster dose to adolescents. The SRR was 100 (95% CI: 98.6, 100.0). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus 
enabling the inference of vaccine efficacy from the adult study. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
The paediatric study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical 
study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in children aged 
6 years through 11 years in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). Participants with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. A total of 4 011 participants were 
randomised 3:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 10 November 2021 was performed in 3 497 participants who received two doses (0.25 mL at 0 
and 1 month) of either Spikevax (original) (n=2 644) or placebo (n=853) and had a negative baseline 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) 
and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.  
There were three COVID-19 cases (0.1%) in the Spikevax (original) group and four COVID-19 cases 
(0.5%) in the placebo group. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
An analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 28 days after 
Dose 2 was conducted in a subset of children aged 6 years through 11 years (n=319) in the paediatric 
study and in participants aged 18 through 25 years (n=295) in the adult study. Subjects had no 
immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The GMR of the 
neutralising antibody titres in children 6 years through 11 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-
olds was 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.1% (95% CI: -1.9, 
2.1). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 
95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study is to infer efficacy of the 
booster dose in participants 6 years through 11 years of age by comparing post-booster dose immune 
responses (Day 29) to those obtained post dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) in that study, where 93% efficacy was demonstrated. Efficacy of the 25 microgram 
Spikevax booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (neutralising antibody [nAb] 
geometric mean concentration [GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet pre-specified non-inferiority 
criteria (for both GMC and SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 
microgram Spikevax primary series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal 
adult efficacy trial. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 6 years through 11 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 95 booster dose participants in 6 years through 
11 years and a random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study who received two doses 
1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of participants included in the analysis population had no 
serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and 
prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
In the 95 participants, on booster dose-Day 29, the GMC was 5847.5 (95% CI: 4999.6, 6839.1). The 
SRR was 100 (95% CI: 95.9, 100.0). Serum nAb levels for children 6 years through 11 years in the 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset with pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 negative status and the 
comparison with those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) were studied. The GMR of booster 
dose Day 29 GMC compared to young adults Day 57 GMC was 4.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 5.0), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI > 0.667); the SRR difference was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -3.5, 2.4), meeting the noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference 
>-10%). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus enabling 
the inference of booster dose vaccine efficacy. The brisk recall response evident within 4 weeks of 
booster dosing is evidence of the robust priming induced by the Spikevax primary series. 
Neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in children 6 years through 11 years of 
age  
Serum samples of the per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n=134) of the ongoing paediatric study 
obtained at baseline and on Day 57 were tested in a PsVNA based on the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.   
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In children 6 years through 11 years of age, the GMFR from baseline to D57 was 81.77 (95% CI: 
70.38, 95.00) for the Delta variant (measured by PsVNA). Furthermore, 99.3% of children met the 
definition of seroresponse. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and 
efficacy of Spikevax in healthy children 6 months through 11 years of age. The study enrolled children 
in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 6 months through 23 months. 
A descriptive efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 21 February 2022 was performed in 5 476 participants 6 months through 5 years of age who 
received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=4 105) or placebo (n=1 371) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (referred to as the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy). Between 
participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences 
in demographics.  
The median length of follow-up for efficacy post-Dose 2 was 71 days for participants 2 years through 
5 years of age and 68 days for participants 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Vaccine efficacy in this study was observed during the period when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant 
was the predominant variant in circulation. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) in Part 2 for the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy for COVID-19 cases 14 days or 
more after dose 2 using the “COVID-19 P301 case definition” (i.e., the definition employed in the 
pivotal adult efficacy study) was 46.4% (95% CI: 19.8, 63.8) for children 2 years through 5 years of 
age and 31.5% (95% CI: -27.7, 62.0) for children 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Immunogenicity in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
For children aged 2 years through 5 years of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb responses in this Part 2 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 264; 25 micrograms) to those of young adults (n = 295; 
100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.014 (95% CI: 0.881, 1.167), meeting the noninferiority 
success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point estimate ≥ 0.8). The geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 for these children was 183.3 (95% CI: 164.03, 
204.91). The difference in seroresponse rates (SRR) between the children and young adults was -0.4% 
(95% CI: -2.7%, 1.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the SRR difference > -10%).  
For infants and toddlers from 6 months through 23 months of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb 
responses in this Part 2 per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 230; 25 micrograms) to those of 
young adults (n = 295; 100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.115, 1.470), 
meeting the noninferiority success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point 
estimate ≥ 0.8). The difference in SRR rates between the infants/toddlers and young adults was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -1.0%, 2.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the seroresponse rate difference > -10%). 
Accordingly, the prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met for 
both age groups, allowing efficacy of 25 micrograms to be inferred in both children 2 years through 
5 years and infants and toddlers aged 6 months through 23 months (Tables 4 and 5).

Immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose. 
Immunogenicity in the study was assessed by measurement of neutralising antibodies against 
pseudovirus expressing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain at 1 month after Dose 2, Dose 3, 
booster dose and up to 12 months from the last dose in Part A, and up to 6 months from booster dose 
in Part B.  
Three doses of Spikevax (original) induced enhanced neutralising antibody titres compared to 
pre-dose 1 and post-dose 2. A higher proportion of SOT participants who had received three doses 
achieved seroresponse compared to participants who had received two doses. The neutralising 
antibody levels observed in SOT liver participants who had received three doses was comparable to 
the post-dose 2 responses observed in the immunocompetent, baseline SARS-CoV-2-negative adult 
participants. The neutralising antibody responses continued to be numerically lower post-dose 3 in 
SOT kidney participants compared to SOT liver participants. The neutralising levels observed one 
month after Dose 3 persisted through six months with antibody levels maintained at 26-fold higher and 
seroresponse rate at 67% compared to baseline. 
A fourth (booster) dose of Spikevax (original) enhanced neutralising antibody response in 
SOT participants compared to post-dose 3, regardless of the previous vaccines received [mRNA-1273 
(Moderna), BNT162b2 or any mRNA-containing combination]; however, SOT kidney participants 
had numerically lower neutralising antibody responses compared to SOT liver participants. 
Elderly 
Spikevax (original) was assessed in individuals 6 months of age and older, including 3 768 subjects 
65 years of age and older. The efficacy of Spikevax (original) was consistent between elderly 
(≥65 years) and younger adult subjects (18-64 years).  
Paediatric population 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
Spikevax (original) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the 
human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and 
transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated 
partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to 
humans is low. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of 
the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies 
were not performed. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of 
mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Spikevax (original) 
was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to 
mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal 
animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and 
offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo 
foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of Spikevax (original) 
vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax (original). Appropriate 
medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic 
reaction following administration of the vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. Subsequent doses of 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 should not be given to those who have experienced 
anaphylaxis to a prior dose of Spikevax (original). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose (see section 4.8).  
Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal 
cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.  
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Capillary leak syndrome flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported in the first days after 
vaccination with Spikevax (original). Healthcare professionals should be aware of signs and symptoms 
of CLS to promptly recognise and treat the condition. In individuals with a medical history of CLS, 
planning of vaccination should be made in collaboration with appropriate medical experts.   
Duration of protection 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical studies. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with all vaccines, vaccination with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not protect all 
vaccine recipients.  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 with other vaccines has 
not been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax 
(original) during the second and third trimester has not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are 
presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or 
post-natal development (see section 5.3). Since differences between products are confined to the spike 
protein sequence, and there are no clinically meaningful differences in reactogenicity, Spikevax 
bivalent Original/ Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breastfeeding. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the 
breastfeeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during 
breastfeeding.

Summary of the safety profile 
Adults  
The safety of Spikevax (original) was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, placebo-
controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States involving 30 351 participants 
18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=15 185) or placebo 
(n=15 166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years 
(range 18-95); 22 831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7 520 (24.8%) of 
participants were 65 years of age and older. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), 
headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), 
axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness 
(10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days 
after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.  
Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence 
of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting 
and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in adolescents were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study with multiple parts conducted in the United States. 
The first portion of the study involved 3 726 participants 12 through 17 years of age who received at 
least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=2 486) or placebo (n=1 240) (NCT04649151). Demographic 
characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who 
received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were injection site pain 
(97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema 
(26%), and fever (14%).   
This study transitioned to an open-label Phase 2/3 study in which 1 346 participants 12 years through 
17 years of age received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 5 months after the second dose of the 
primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified in the open-label portion of the study.

Children 6 years through 11 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in children were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 two-part 
randomised, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). 
Part 1 is an open-label phase of the study for safety, dose selection, and immunogenicity and included 
380 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax 
(original). Part 2 is the placebo-controlled phase for safety and included 4 016 participants 6 years 
through 11 years of age who received at least one dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax (original) (n=3 012) or 
placebo (n=1 004). No participants in Part 1 participated in Part 2. Demographic characteristics were 
similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 6 years through 11 years of age following 
administration of the primary series (in Part 2) were injection site pain (98.4%), fatigue (73.1%), 
headache (62.1%), myalgia (35.3%), chills (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), axillary 
swelling/tenderness (27.0%), fever (25.7%), injection site erythema (24.0%), injection site swelling 
(22.3%), and arthralgia (21.3%).   
The study protocol was amended to include an open-label booster dose phase that included 
1 294 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 
6 months after the second dose of the primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified 
in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax was conducted in the United States and Canada. 
This study involved 10 390 participants 6 months through 11 years of age who received at least one 
dose of Spikevax (n=7 798) or placebo (n=2 592). 
The study enrolled children in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 
6 months through 23 months. This paediatric study involved 6 388 participants 6 months through 
5 years of age who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=4 791) or placebo (n=1 597). 
Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax and those who 
received placebo. 
In this clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 6 months through 23 months of age 
following administration of the primary series were irritability/crying (81.5%), pain at the injection 
site (56.2%), sleepiness (51.1%), loss of appetite (45.7%), fever (21.8%), swelling at the injection site 
(18.4%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (12.2%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 24 through 36 months of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (76.8%), irritability/crying (71.0%), sleepiness (49.7%), 
loss of appetite (42.4%), fever (26.1%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), swelling at the 
injection site (15.7%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (11.5%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 37 months through 5 years of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (83.8%), fatigue (61.9%), headache (22.9%), myalgia 
(22.1%), fever (20.9%), chills (16.8%), nausea/vomiting (15.2%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(14.3%), arthralgia (12.8%), erythema at the injection site (9.5%), and swelling at the injection site 
(8.2%).

*Lymphadenopathy was captured as axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side as the injection site. Other lymph nodes 
(e.g., cervical, supraclavicular) were affected in some cases. 
† Observed in the paediatric population (6 months to 5 years of age). 
‡ Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by three participants in the 
Spikevax (original) group and one participant in the placebo group. Onset in the vaccine group 
participants was 22 days, 28 days, and 32 days after Dose 2.  
§ Abdominal pain was observed in the paediatric population (6 to 11 years of age): 0.2% in the Spikevax (original) group and 
0% in the placebo group. 
¶ Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset (within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to 
approximately two weeks after vaccination). 
# Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
♠ Median time to onset was 9 days after the first injection, and 11 days after the second injection. Median duration was 
4 days after the first injection, and 4 days after the second injection. 
♥ There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological 
fillers. The onset of swelling was reported on Day 1 and Day 3, respectively, relative to day of vaccination.  
The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving Spikevax (original), that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.  
Adults (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine primary series. In an 
open-label phase of this study, 167 of those participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 
50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited 
adverse reaction profile for the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was similar to that after the 
second dose in the primary series. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 
18 years of age and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the 
Spikevax (original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the Spikevax 
(original) booster given as a second booster dose. The frequency of adverse reactions after 
immunisation with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 was also similar or lower relative to that 
of a first booster dose of Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) and relative to the second dose of the 
Spikevax (original) primary series (100 micrograms). The safety profile of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (median follow-up period of 113 days) was similar to the safety profile of 
Spikevax (original) (median follow-up period of 127 days). 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a bivalent booster dose of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 
18 years of age and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 511 participants received a booster dose 
of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (50 micrograms), and 376 participants received a 
booster dose of Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms). 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the 
Spikevax (original) booster given as a second booster dose.  
Spikevax (original) in solid organ transplant recipients   
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth dose for mRNA vaccines 
and third dose for non-mRNA vaccines).  
Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Spikevax (original). There were no 
unexpected safety findings. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax (original) is highest in younger 
males (see section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Spikevax (original). One study showed that in a period of 7 days 
after the second dose, there were about 1.316 (95% CI: 1.299, 1.333) extra cases of myocarditis in 12 
to 29 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 
28 days after the second dose, there were 1.88 (95% CI: 0.956, 2.804) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 
to 24 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
Spikevax (elasomeran) and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (elasomeran/imelasomeran) 
both contain mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA encodes for the full-length 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain 
(S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. After intramuscular injection, cells 
at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering 
the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. The delivered mRNA does not enter 
the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly 
by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The expressed, membrane-bound spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and 
B-cell responses to generate neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against 
COVID-19. The nucleoside-modified mRNA in Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(elasomeran/davesomeran) is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the nucleoside-
modified mRNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits 
an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19. 
Clinical efficacy 
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 booster dose (0.5 mL, 25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
booster dose are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 18 years of age 
and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 511 participants received the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 50 microgram booster dose, and 376 participants received the Spikevax 
(original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Study P205 Part H evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 when administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously 
received 2 doses of Spikevax (original) (100 microgram) as a primary series and a first booster dose of 
Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms). In P205 Part F, study participants received Spikevax (original) 
(50 micrograms) as a second booster dose and the Part F group serves as a within-study, 
non-contemporaneous comparator group to the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 group.  
In this study, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the primary immunogenicity set 
which includes participants with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (pre-booster). In 
the primary analysis, the observed geometric mean titre (GMT) (95% CI) at pre-booster was 87.9 
(72.2, 107.1) and increased to 2 324.6 (1 921.2, 2 812.7) 28 days after the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster dose. The Day 29 GMR for Spikevax Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
50 microgram booster dose versus the Spikevax (original) 50 microgram booster dose was 6.29 (5.27, 
7.51), meeting the pre-specified criterion for superiority (lower bound of CI >1). 
The estimated neutralising antibody GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 adjusted for pre-
booster titre and age group were 2 747.3 (2 399.2, 3 145.9) and 436.7 (389.1, 490.0) 28 days after 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Spikevax (original) booster doses, respectively, and 
the GMR (95% CI) was 6.29 (5.27, 7.51), meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority (lower 
bound of CI >0.667). 
Immunogenicity in adults – after Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster dose (0.5 mL, 
25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
booster dose are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 18 years of age 
and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the Spikevax 
(original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Study P205 Part G evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 when administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously received 
2 doses of Spikevax (original) (100 microgram) as a primary series and a booster dose of Spikevax 
(original) (50 micrograms) at least 3 months prior to enrolment. In P205 Part F, study participants 
received Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) as a second booster dose and the Part G group serves as 
a within-study, non-contemporaneous comparator group to the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1 group.  
In this study, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the primary immunogenicity set 
which includes participants with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (pre-booster). In 
the primary analysis, the original SARS-CoV-2 estimated neutralising antibody geometric mean titre 
(GMT) and corresponding 95% CI was 6 422.3 (5 990.1, 6 885.7) and 5 286.6 (4 887.1, 5 718.9) 
28 days after the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax (original) booster doses, 
respectively. These GMTs represent the ratio between response of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 versus Spikevax (original) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.22 (1.08, 1.37) meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority 
(lower bound of 97.5% CI ≥0.67).  
The estimated Day 29 neutralising antibody GMTs against Omicron, BA.1 were 2 479.9 (2 264.5, 
2 715.8) and 1 421.2 (1 283.0, 1 574.4) in the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax 
(original) booster groups, respectively, and the GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04), which met the 
pre-specified superiority criterion (lower bound of CI >1).  
Three-month antibody persistence of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster vaccine 
against COVID-19 
Participants in Study P205 Part G were sequentially enrolled to receive 50 micrograms of Spikevax 
(original) (n = 376) or Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (n = 437) as second booster doses. In 
participants with no pre-booster incidence of SARS-CoV-2, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
elicited Omicron-BA.1-neutralising antibody titres (observed GMT) that were significantly higher 
(964.4 [834.4, 1 114.7]) than those of Spikevax (original) (624.2 [533.1, 730.9]) and similar between 
boosters against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 at three months. 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
The adult study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study 
(NCT04470427) that excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received 
immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza 
vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of Spikevax (original). 
Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of 
blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or 
Spikevax (original). 
A total of 30 351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development 
of COVID-19 disease.  
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 
28 207 subjects who received either Spikevax (original) (n=14 134) or placebo (n=14 073) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 
79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified 
as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of –7 
to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in 
the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 
(corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days). 
COVID-19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and 
by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented 
in Table 5.

Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group 
compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group. Of the 30 participants with severe 
disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the 
remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤ 93% 
on room air).  
The vaccine efficacy of Spikevax (original) to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection (determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days 
after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% CI: 88.6, 96.5).  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity in adults – after booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine as primary series. In 
an open-label phase, 149 of those participants (Per Protocol Set) received a single booster dose 
(0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose in the primary series. A 
single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 
28 days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) 
when compared 28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose. 
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine in adults  
Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous booster with Spikevax (original) were studied in an 
investigator-initiated study with 154 participants. The minimum time interval between primary series 
using a vector-based or RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and booster injection with Spikevax (original) 
was 12 weeks (range: 12 weeks to 20.9 weeks). The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessed on Day 1 prior to administration and at Day 15 and Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster 
response was demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination. 
Only short-term immunogenicity data are available; long-term protection and immunological memory 
are currently unknown. 
Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) in the UK 
COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed immunology. Participants were 
adults aged 30 years or older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well-controlled co-morbidities 
were permitted), who had received two doses of either Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca (first 
dose in December 2020, January 2021 or February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second dose 
by the time of enrolment. Spikevax (original) boosted antibody and neutralising responses and was 
well tolerated regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 28 after the booster dose. 
Pre-boost and post-boost neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in adults 
Results of the pseudovirus neutralisation assay (PsVNA) against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant 
determined pre-booster and on Day 29 post-booster showed that administration of a booster dose of 
Spikevax (original) (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) in adults induced a 17-fold rise in neutralising 
antibodies against the Delta variant compared with pre-booster levels (GMFR = 17.28; 95% CI: 14.38, 
20.77; n=295).   
Clinical efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The adolescent study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical 
study (NCT04649151) to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
excluded from the study. A total of 3 732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of 
Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis was performed in 3 181 participants who received 2 doses of either 
Spikevax (original) (n=2 139) or placebo (n=1 042) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status 
in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received 
placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.   
There were zero symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Spikevax (original) group and 4 symptomatic 
COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age – after Spikevax primary vaccination 
A non-inferiority analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 
28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in the per-protocol immunogenicity subsets of adolescents aged 
12 through 17 (n=340) in the adolescent study and in participants aged 18 through 25 (n=296) in the 
adult study. Subjects had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the neutralising antibody titres in adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.24). The difference in 
seroresponse rate was 0.2% (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI 
for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 years through 17 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster 
dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study was to infer 
efficacy of the booster dose in participants 12 years through 17 years of age by comparing 
post-booster immune responses (Day 29) to those obtained post-dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in the adult study. Efficacy of the 50 microgram Spikevax 
booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (nAb geometric mean concentration 
[GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet prespecified noninferiority criteria (for both GMC and 
SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 microgram Spikevax primary 
series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal adult efficacy study. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 12 years through 17 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 5 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 257 booster dose participants in this study and a 
random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study (ages ≥18 to ≤25 years) who previously 
completed a primary vaccination series of two doses 1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of 
participants included in the analysis population had no serologic or virologic evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
The GMR of the adolescent booster dose Day 29 GMC compared with young adults: Day 57 GMR 
was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.5, 5.8), meeting the noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI >0.667 
(1/1.5); point estimate ≥0.8); the SRR difference was 0.7% (95% CI: -0.8, 2.4), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference >-10%). 
In the 257 participants, pre-booster (booster dose-Day 1) nAb GMC was 400.4 (95% CI: 370.0, 
433.4); on BD-Day 29, the GMC was 7 172.0 (95% CI: 6 610.4, 7 781.4). Post-booster booster 
dose-Day 29 GMC increased approximately 18-fold from pre-booster GMC, demonstrating the 
potency of the booster dose to adolescents. The SRR was 100 (95% CI: 98.6, 100.0). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus 
enabling the inference of vaccine efficacy from the adult study. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
The paediatric study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical 
study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in children aged 
6 years through 11 years in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). Participants with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. A total of 4 011 participants were 
randomised 3:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 10 November 2021 was performed in 3 497 participants who received two doses (0.25 mL at 0 
and 1 month) of either Spikevax (original) (n=2 644) or placebo (n=853) and had a negative baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) 
and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.  
There were three COVID-19 cases (0.1%) in the Spikevax (original) group and four COVID-19 cases 
(0.5%) in the placebo group. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
An analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 28 days after 
Dose 2 was conducted in a subset of children aged 6 years through 11 years (n=319) in the paediatric 
study and in participants aged 18 through 25 years (n=295) in the adult study. Subjects had no 
immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The GMR of the 
neutralising antibody titres in children 6 years through 11 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-
olds was 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.1% (95% CI: -1.9, 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 
95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study is to infer efficacy of the 
booster dose in participants 6 years through 11 years of age by comparing post-booster dose immune 
responses (Day 29) to those obtained post dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) in that study, where 93% efficacy was demonstrated. Efficacy of the 25 microgram 
Spikevax booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (neutralising antibody [nAb] 
geometric mean concentration [GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet pre-specified non-inferiority 
criteria (for both GMC and SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 
microgram Spikevax primary series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal 
adult efficacy trial. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 6 years through 11 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 95 booster dose participants in 6 years through 
11 years and a random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study who received two doses 
1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of participants included in the analysis population had no 
serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and 
prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
In the 95 participants, on booster dose-Day 29, the GMC was 5 847.5 (95% CI: 4 999.6, 6 839.1). The 
SRR was 100 (95% CI: 95.9, 100.0). Serum nAb levels for children 6 years through 11 years in the 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset with pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 negative status and the 
comparison with those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) were studied. The GMR of booster 
dose Day 29 GMC compared to young adults Day 57 GMC was 4.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 5.0), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI > 0.667); the SRR difference was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -3.5, 2.4), meeting the noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference 
>-10%). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus enabling 
the inference of booster dose vaccine efficacy. The brisk recall response evident within 4 weeks of 
booster dosing is evidence of the robust priming induced by the Spikevax primary series. 
Neutralising antibody against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in children 6 years through 11 years of 
age  
Serum samples of the per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n=134) of the ongoing paediatric study 
obtained at baseline and on Day 57 were tested in a PsVNA based on the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.   
In children 6 years through 11 years of age, the GMFR from baseline to D57 was 81.77 (95% CI: 
70.38, 95.00) for the Delta variant (measured by PsVNA). Furthermore, 99.3% of children met the 
definition of seroresponse. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and 
efficacy of Spikevax in healthy children 6 months through 11 years of age. The study enrolled children 
in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 6 months through 23 months. 
A descriptive efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 21 February 2022 was performed in 5 476 participants 6 months through 5 years of age who 
received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=4 105) or placebo (n=1 371) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (referred to as the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy). Between 
participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences 
in demographics.  
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median length of follow-up for efficacy post-Dose 2 was 71 days for participants 2 years through 
5 years of age and 68 days for participants 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Vaccine efficacy in this study was observed during the period when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant 
was the predominant variant in circulation. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) in Part 2 for the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy for COVID-19 cases 14 days or 
more after dose 2 using the “COVID-19 P301 case definition” (i.e., the definition employed in the 
pivotal adult efficacy study) was 46.4% (95% CI: 19.8, 63.8) for children 2 years through 5 years of 
age and 31.5% (95% CI: -27.7, 62.0) for children 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Immunogenicity in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
For children aged 2 years through 5 years of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb responses in this Part 2 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 264; 25 micrograms) to those of young adults (n = 295; 
100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.014 (95% CI: 0.881, 1.167), meeting the noninferiority 
success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point estimate ≥ 0.8). The geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 for these children was 183.3 (95% CI: 164.03, 
204.91). The difference in seroresponse rates (SRR) between the children and young adults was -0.4% 
(95% CI: -2.7%, 1.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the SRR difference > -10%).  
For infants and toddlers from 6 months through 23 months of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb 
responses in this Part 2 per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 230; 25 micrograms) to those of 
young adults (n = 295; 100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.115, 1.470), 
meeting the noninferiority success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point 
estimate ≥ 0.8). The difference in SRR rates between the infants/toddlers and young adults was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -1.0%, 2.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the seroresponse rate difference > -10%). 
Accordingly, the prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met for 
both age groups, allowing efficacy of 25 micrograms to be inferred in both children 2 years through 
5 years and infants and toddlers aged 6 months through 23 months (Tables 6 and 7).

Immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose. 
Immunogenicity in the study was assessed by measurement of neutralising antibodies against 
pseudovirus expressing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain at 1 month after Dose 2, Dose 3, 
booster dose and up to 12 months from the last dose in Part A, and up to 6 months from booster dose 
in Part B.  
Three doses of Spikevax (original) induced enhanced neutralising antibody titres compared to 
pre-dose 1 and post-dose 2. A higher proportion of SOT participants who had received three doses 
achieved seroresponse compared to participants who had received two doses. The neutralising 
antibody levels observed in SOT liver participants who had received three doses was comparable to 
the post-dose 2 responses observed in the immunocompetent, baseline SARS-CoV-2-negative adult 
participants. The neutralising antibody responses continued to be numerically lower post-dose 3 in 
SOT kidney participants compared to SOT liver participants. The neutralising levels observed one 
month after Dose 3 persisted through six months with antibody levels maintained at 26-fold higher and 
seroresponse rate at 67% compared to baseline. 
A fourth (booster) dose of Spikevax (original) enhanced neutralising antibody response in 
SOT participants compared to post-dose 3, regardless of the previous vaccines received [mRNA-1273 
(Moderna), BNT162b2 or any mRNA-containing combination]; however, SOT kidney participants 
had numerically lower neutralising antibody responses compared to SOT liver participants. 
Elderly 
Spikevax (original) was assessed in individuals 6 months of age and older, including 3 768 subjects 
65 years of age and older. The efficacy of Spikevax (original) was consistent between elderly 
(≥65 years) and younger adult subjects (18-64 years).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
Spikevax (original) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the 
human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and 
transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to 
humans is low. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of 
the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies 
were not performed. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of 
mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Spikevax (original) 
was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to 
mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal 
animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and 
offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo 
foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of Spikevax (original) 
vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax (original). Appropriate 
medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic 
reaction following administration of the vaccine.  
Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. Subsequent doses of 
Spikevax XBB.1.5 should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to a prior dose of 
Spikevax (original). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose (see section 4.8).  
Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal 
cases have been observed.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.  
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals. 
Capillary leak syndrome flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported in the first days after 
vaccination with Spikevax (original). Healthcare professionals should be aware of signs and symptoms 
of CLS to promptly recognise and treat the condition. In individuals with a medical history of CLS, 
planning of vaccination should be made in collaboration with appropriate medical experts.   
Duration of protection 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical studies. 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with all vaccines, vaccination with Spikevax XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipients.  
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Concomitant administration of Spikevax XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
No data are available yet regarding the use of andusomeran during pregnancy. 
However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax 
(original) during the second and third trimester has not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are 
presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or 
post-natal development (see section 5.3). Since differences between products are confined to the spike 
protein sequence, and there are no clinically meaningful differences in reactogenicity, andusomeran 
can be used during pregnancy.

No data are available yet regarding the use of andusomeran during breastfeeding. 
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the 
breastfeeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Andusomeran can be used during breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Andusomeran has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some 
of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

Summary of the safety profile 
Adults  
The safety of Spikevax (original) was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, placebo-
controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States involving 30 351 participants 
18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=15 185) or placebo 
(n=15 166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years 
(range 18-95); 22 831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7 520 (24.8%) of 
participants were 65 years of age and older. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), 
headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), 
axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness 
(10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days 
after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.  
Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence 
of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting 
and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in adolescents were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study with multiple parts conducted in the United States. 
The first portion of the study involved 3 726 participants 12 through 17 years of age who received at 
least one dose of Spikevax (original) (n=2 486) or placebo (n=1 240) (NCT04649151). Demographic 
characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who 
received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were injection site pain 
(97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema 
(26%), and fever (14%).   
This study transitioned to an open-label Phase 2/3 study in which 1 346 participants 12 years through 
17 years of age received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 5 months after the second dose of the 
primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 years through 11 years of age 
Safety data for Spikevax (original) in children were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 two-part 
randomised, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). 
Part 1 is an open-label phase of the study for safety, dose selection, and immunogenicity and included 
380 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax 
(original). Part 2 is the placebo-controlled phase for safety and included 4 016 participants 6 years 
through 11 years of age who received at least one dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax (original) (n=3 012) or 
placebo (n=1 004). No participants in Part 1 participated in Part 2. Demographic characteristics were 
similar among participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received placebo. 
The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 6 years through 11 years of age following 
administration of the primary series (in Part 2) were injection site pain (98.4%), fatigue (73.1%), 
headache (62.1%), myalgia (35.3%), chills (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), axillary 
swelling/tenderness (27.0%), fever (25.7%), injection site erythema (24.0%), injection site swelling 
(22.3%), and arthralgia (21.3%).   
83 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study protocol was amended to include an open-label booster dose phase that included 
1 294 participants 6 years through 11 years of age who received a booster dose of Spikevax at least 
6 months after the second dose of the primary series. No additional adverse reactions were identified 
in the open-label portion of the study. 
Children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax was conducted in the United States and Canada. 
This study involved 10 390 participants 6 months through 11 years of age who received at least one 
dose of Spikevax (n=7 798) or placebo (n=2 592). 
The study enrolled children in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 
6 months through 23 months. This paediatric study involved 6 388 participants 6 months through 
5 years of age who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=4 791) or placebo (n=1 597). 
Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax and those who 
received placebo. 
In this clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 6 months through 23 months of age 
following administration of the primary series were irritability/crying (81.5%), pain at the injection 
site (56.2%), sleepiness (51.1%), loss of appetite (45.7%), fever (21.8%), swelling at the injection site 
(18.4%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (12.2%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 24 through 36 months of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (76.8%), irritability/crying (71.0%), sleepiness (49.7%), 
loss of appetite (42.4%), fever (26.1%), erythema at the injection site (17.9%), swelling at the 
injection site (15.7%), and axillary swelling/tenderness (11.5%). 
The adverse reactions in participants 37 months through 5 years of age following administration of the 
primary series were pain at the injection site (83.8%), fatigue (61.9%), headache (22.9%), myalgia 
(22.1%), fever (20.9%), chills (16.8%), nausea/vomiting (15.2%), axillary swelling/tenderness 
(14.3%), arthralgia (12.8%), erythema at the injection site (9.5%), and swelling at the injection site 
(8.2%).

† Observed in the paediatric population (6 months to 5 years of age). 
‡ Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by three participants in the 
Spikevax (original) group and one participant in the placebo group. Onset in the vaccine group 
participants was 22 days, 28 days, and 32 days after Dose 2.  
§ Abdominal pain was observed in the paediatric population (6 to 11 years of age): 0.2% in the Spikevax (original) group and 
0% in the placebo group. 
¶ Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset (within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to 
approximately two weeks after vaccination). 
# Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. 
♠ Median time to onset was 9 days after the first injection, and 11 days after the second injection. Median duration was 
4 days after the first injection, and 4 days after the second injection. 
♥ There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological 
fillers. The onset of swelling was reported on Day 1 and Day 3, respectively, relative to day of vaccination.  
85 
 
 
 
The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving Spikevax (original), that were 
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.  
Adults (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine primary series. In an 
open-label phase of this study, 167 of those participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 
50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited 
adverse reaction profile for the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was similar to that after the 
second dose in the primary series. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 
18 years of age and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the 
Spikevax (original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the Spikevax 
(original) booster given as a second booster dose. The frequency of adverse reactions after 
immunisation with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 was also similar or lower relative to that 
of a first booster dose of Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) and relative to the second dose of the 
Spikevax (original) primary series (100 micrograms). The safety profile of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (median follow-up period of 113 days) was similar to the safety profile of 
Spikevax (original) (median follow-up period of 127 days). 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a bivalent booster dose of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 
18 years of age and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 511 participants received a booster dose 
of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (50 micrograms), and 376 participants received a 
booster dose of Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms). 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of the 
Spikevax (original) booster given as a second booster dose.  
Spikevax XBB.1.5 (booster dose) 
The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax XBB.1.5 are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in adults (mRNA-1273-P205, Part J). In this study, 
50 participants received a booster dose of Spikevax XBB.1.5 (50 micrograms) and 51 participants 
received a booster dose of an investigational bivalent Omicron XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 vaccine 
(50 micrograms). 
The reactogenicity profile of Spikevax XBB.1.5 was similar to that of Spikevax (original) and 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5. The median follow-up time for both vaccine groups in 
this interim analysis was 20 days (range of 20 to 22 days with data cut-off date of 16 May 2023). 
Spikevax (original) in solid organ transplant recipients  
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth dose for mRNA vaccines 
and third dose for non-mRNA vaccines).  
Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Spikevax (original). There were no 
unexpected safety findings.  
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax (original) is highest in younger 
males (see section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger 
males following the second dose of Spikevax (original). One study showed that in a period of 7 days 
after the second dose, there were about 1.316 (95% CI: 1.299, 1.333) extra cases of myocarditis in 12 
to 29 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 
28 days after the second dose, there were 1.88 (95% CI: 0.956, 2.804) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 
to 24 year-old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 
4.9  Overdose  
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 
Mechanism of action 
Elasomeran and elasomeran/imelasomeran both contain mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. 
The mRNA encodes for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline 
substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion 
conformation. After intramuscular injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes 
take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into 
viral protein. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus 
macrophages. The expressed, membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by 
immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralising 
antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. The nucleoside-modified mRNA in 
elasomeran/davesomeran and in andusomeran is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of 
the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The 
vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19.

Immunogenicity in adults – after Spikevax XBB.1.5 dose (0.5 mL, 50 micrograms) versus an 
investigational bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 dose (0.5 mL, 25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax XBB.1.5 50 micrograms and of a bivalent 
vaccine that contains equal mRNA amounts of Omicron XBB.1.5 and Omicron BA.4-5 spike proteins 
(25 micrograms XBB.1.5 / 25 micrograms BA.4-5) are evaluated in a Phase 2/3 open-label study in 
adults. In this study, 50 participants received Spikevax XBB.1.5 and 51 participants received the 
investigational bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 (mRNA-1273- P205, Part J). The two groups were 
randomised 1:1. 
The vaccines were administered as a fifth dose to adults who previously received a two-dose primary 
series of any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a booster dose of any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and a 
booster dose of any mRNA bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine.  
Spikevax XBB.1.5 and bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 elicited potent neutralising responses at Day 15 
against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, BA.4-5, BQ.1.1 and D614G. In the per-protocol immunogenicity set that 
includes all participants, with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=49 and N=50 for Spikevax 
XBB.1.5 and bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 groups, respectively), the Day 15 GMFR (95% CI) for 
Spikevax XBB.1.5 and bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 was 16.7 (12.8, 21.7) and 11.6 (8.7, 15.4), 
respectively, against XBB.1.5 and 6.3 (4.8, 8.2) and 5.3 (3.9, 7.1) against BA.4-5.    
For variants not contained in the vaccines, the Day 15 GMFR (95% CI) for Spikevax XBB.1.5 and 
bivalent XBB.1.5/BA.4-5 was 11.4 (8.5, 15.4) and 9.3 (7.0, 12.3) against XBB.1.16; 5.8 (4.7, 7.3) and 
6.1 (4.6, 7.9) against BQ.1.1 and 2.8 (2.2, 3.5) and 2.3 (1.9, 2.8) against D614G.  
Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older – after Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 booster dose (0.5 mL, 25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
booster dose are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 18 years of age 
and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 511 participants received the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 50 microgram booster dose, and 376 participants received the Spikevax 
(original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Study P205 Part H evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 when administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously 
received 2 doses of Spikevax (original) (100 microgram) as a primary series and a first booster dose of 
Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms). In P205 Part F, study participants received Spikevax (original) 
(50 micrograms) as a second booster dose and the Part F group serves as a within-study, 
non-contemporaneous comparator group to the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 group.  
In this study, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the primary immunogenicity set 
which includes participants with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (pre-booster). In 
the primary analysis, the observed geometric mean titre (GMT) (95% CI) at pre-booster was 87.9 
(72.2, 107.1) and increased to 2 324.6 (1 921.2, 2 812.7) 28 days after the Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster dose. The Day 29 GMR for Spikevax Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
50 microgram booster dose versus the Spikevax (original) 50 microgram booster dose was 6.29 (5.27, 
7.51), meeting the pre-specified criterion for superiority (lower bound of CI >1). 
The estimated neutralising antibody GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 adjusted for 
pre-booster titre and age group were 2 747.3 (2 399.2, 3 145.9) and 436.7 (389.1, 490.0) 28 days after 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Spikevax (original) booster doses, respectively, and 
the GMR (95% CI) was 6.29 (5.27, 7.51), meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority (lower 
bound of CI >0.667). 
Immunogenicity in adults – after Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster dose (0.5 mL, 
25 micrograms/25 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
booster dose are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2/3 open-label study in participants 18 years of age 
and older (mRNA-1273-P205). In this study, 437 participants received the Spikevax bivalent 
88 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Original/Omicron BA.1 50 microgram booster dose, and 377 participants received the Spikevax 
(original) 50 microgram booster dose. 
Study P205 Part G evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 when administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously received 
2 doses of Spikevax (original) (100 microgram) as a primary series and a booster dose of Spikevax 
(original) (50 micrograms) at least 3 months prior to enrolment. In P205 Part F, study participants 
received Spikevax (original) (50 micrograms) as a second booster dose and the Part G group serves as 
a within-study, non-contemporaneous comparator group to the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1 group.  
In this study, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the primary immunogenicity set 
which includes participants with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (pre-booster). In 
the primary analysis, the original SARS-CoV-2 estimated neutralising antibody geometric mean titre 
(GMT) and corresponding 95% CI was 6 422.3 (5 990.1, 6 885.7) and 5 286.6 (4 887.1, 5 718.9) 
28 days after the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax (original) booster doses, 
respectively. These GMTs represent the ratio between response of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 versus Spikevax (original) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain. 
The GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.22 (1.08, 1.37) meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority 
(lower bound of 97.5% CI ≥0.67).  
The estimated Day 29 neutralising antibody GMTs against Omicron, BA.1 were 2 479.9 (2 264.5, 
2 715.8) and 1 421.2 (1 283.0, 1 574.4) in the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax 
(original) booster groups, respectively, and the GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04), which met the 
pre-specified superiority criterion (lower bound of CI >1).  
Three-month antibody persistence of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 booster vaccine 
against COVID-19 
Participants in Study P205 Part G were sequentially enrolled to receive 50 micrograms of Spikevax 
(original) (n = 376) or Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (n = 437) as second booster doses. In 
participants with no pre-booster incidence of SARS-CoV-2, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
elicited Omicron-BA.1-neutralising antibody titres (observed GMT) that were significantly higher 
(964.4 [834.4, 1 114.7]) than those of Spikevax (original) (624.2 [533.1, 730.9]) and similar between 
boosters against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 at three months. 
Clinical efficacy in adults 
The adult study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study 
(NCT04470427) that excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received 
immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza 
vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of Spikevax (original). 
Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of 
blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or 
Spikevax (original). 
A total of 30 351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development 
of COVID-19 disease.  
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 
28 207 subjects who received either Spikevax (original) (n=14 134) or placebo (n=14 073) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 
79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified 
as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of –7 
to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in 
the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 
(corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days).

*Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
** CI not adjusted for multiplicity. Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an interim 
analysis based on less COVID-19 cases, not reported here. 
Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group 
compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group. Of the 30 participants with severe 
disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the 
remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤ 93% 
on room air).  
The vaccine efficacy of Spikevax (original) to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection (determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days 
after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% CI: 88.6, 96.5).  
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point 
estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with 
high risk of severe COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity in adults – after booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax (original) are evaluated 
in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in 
participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two 
doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax (original) vaccine as primary series. In 
an open-label phase, 149 of those participants (Per Protocol Set) received a single booster dose 
(0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose in the primary series. A 
single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
28 days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) 
when compared 28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose. 
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 
vaccine in adults  
Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous booster with Spikevax (original) were studied in an 
investigator-initiated study with 154 participants. The minimum time interval between primary series 
using a vector-based or RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and booster injection with Spikevax (original) 
was 12 weeks (range: 12 weeks to 20.9 weeks). The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 1 prior to administration and at Day 15 and Day 29 after the booster dose. A booster 
response was demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination. 
Only short-term immunogenicity data are available; long-term protection and immunological memory 
are currently unknown. 
Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) in the UK 
COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of third dose booster 
vaccination against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed immunology. Participants were 
adults aged 30 years or older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well-controlled co-morbidities 
were permitted), who had received two doses of either Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca (first 
dose in December 2020, January 2021 or February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second dose 
by the time of enrolment. Spikevax (original) boosted antibody and neutralising responses and was 
well tolerated regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting in this study was 
100 micrograms. Neutralising antibody titres as measured by a pseudovirus neutralisation assay were 
assessed on Day 28 after the booster dose. 
Clinical efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
The adolescent study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical 
study (NCT04649151) to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
excluded from the study. A total of 3 732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of 
Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis was performed in 3 181 participants who received 2 doses of either 
Spikevax (original) (n=2 139) or placebo (n=1 042) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status 
in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) and those who received 
placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.   
There were zero symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Spikevax (original) group and 4 symptomatic 
COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.  
Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age – after Spikevax primary vaccination 
A non-inferiority analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 
28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in the per-protocol immunogenicity subsets of adolescents aged 
12 through 17 (n=340) in the adolescent study and in participants aged 18 through 25 (n=296) in the 
adult study. Subjects had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
baseline. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the neutralising antibody titres in adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.24). The difference in 
seroresponse rate was 0.2% (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI 
for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met.

The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study was to infer 
efficacy of the booster dose in participants 12 years through 17 years of age by comparing 
post-booster immune responses (Day 29) to those obtained post-dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in the adult study. Efficacy of the 50 microgram Spikevax 
booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (nAb geometric mean concentration 
[GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet prespecified noninferiority criteria (for both GMC and 
SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 microgram Spikevax primary 
series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal adult efficacy study. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 12 years through 17 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 5 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 257 booster dose participants in this study and a 
random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study (ages ≥18 to ≤25 years) who previously 
completed a primary vaccination series of two doses 1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of 
participants included in the analysis population had no serologic or virologic evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
The GMR of the adolescent booster dose Day 29 GMC compared with young adults: Day 57 GMR 
was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.5, 5.8), meeting the noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI >0.667 
(1/1.5); point estimate ≥0.8); the SRR difference was 0.7% (95% CI: -0.8, 2.4), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference >-10%). 
In the 257 participants, pre-booster (booster dose-Day 1) nAb GMC was 400.4 (95% CI: 370.0, 
433.4); on BD-Day 29, the GMC was 7 172.0 (95% CI: 6 610.4, 7 781.4). Post-booster booster 
dose-Day 29 GMC increased approximately 18-fold from pre-booster GMC, demonstrating the 
potency of the booster dose to adolescents. The SRR was 100 (95% CI: 98.6, 100.0). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus 
enabling the inference of vaccine efficacy from the adult study. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
The paediatric study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical 
study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (original) in children aged 
6 years through 11 years in the United States and Canada (NCT04796896). Participants with a known 
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. A total of 4 011 participants were 
randomised 3:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax (original) or saline placebo 1 month apart.  
A secondary efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 10 November 2021 was performed in 3 497 participants who received two doses (0.25 mL at 0 
and 1 month) of either Spikevax (original) (n=2 644) or placebo (n=853) and had a negative baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax (original) 
and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics.  
COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 
2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose.  
There were three COVID-19 cases (0.1%) in the Spikevax (original) group and four COVID-19 cases 
(0.5%) in the placebo group. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age 
An analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres and seroresponse rates 28 days after 
Dose 2 was conducted in a subset of children aged 6 years through 11 years (n=319) in the paediatric 
study and in participants aged 18 through 25 years (n=295) in the adult study. Subjects had no 
immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The GMR of the 
neutralising antibody titres in children 6 years through 11 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-
olds was 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.1% (95% CI: -1.9, 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1). Non-inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR > 0.67 and lower bound of the 
95% CI of the seroresponse rate difference > -10%) were met. 
Immunogenicity in children 6 years through 11 years of age – after Spikevax (original) booster dose  
The primary immunogenicity objective of the booster phase of this study is to infer efficacy of the 
booster dose in participants 6 years through 11 years of age by comparing post-booster dose immune 
responses (Day 29) to those obtained post dose 2 of the primary series (Day 57) in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) in that study, where 93% efficacy was demonstrated. Efficacy of the 25 microgram 
Spikevax booster dose is inferred if post-booster dose immune responses (neutralising antibody [nAb] 
geometric mean concentration [GMC] and seroresponse rate [SRR]) meet pre-specified non-inferiority 
criteria (for both GMC and SRR) compared to those measured following completion of the 100 
microgram Spikevax primary series among a subset of young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal 
adult efficacy trial. 
In an open-label phase of this study, participants 6 years through 11 years of age received a single 
booster dose at least 6 months after completion of the primary series (two doses 1 month apart). The 
primary immunogenicity analysis population included 95 booster dose participants in 6 years through 
11 years and a random subset of 295 participants from the young adult study who received two doses 
1 month apart of Spikevax. Both groups of participants included in the analysis population had no 
serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first primary series dose and 
prior to the booster dose, respectively.  
In the 95 participants, on booster dose-Day 29, the GMC was 5 847.5 (95% CI: 4 999.6, 6 839.1). The 
SRR was 100 (95% CI: 95.9, 100.0). Serum nAb levels for children 6 years through 11 years in the 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset with pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 negative status and the 
comparison with those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) were studied. The GMR of booster 
dose Day 29 GMC compared to young adults Day 57 GMC was 4.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 5.0), meeting the 
noninferiority criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI > 0.667); the SRR difference was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -3.5, 2.4), meeting the noninferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR difference 
>-10%). 
The prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met, thus enabling 
the inference of booster dose vaccine efficacy. The brisk recall response evident within 4 weeks of 
booster dosing is evidence of the robust priming induced by the Spikevax primary series. 
Clinical efficacy in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and 
efficacy of Spikevax in healthy children 6 months through 11 years of age. The study enrolled children 
in 3 age groups: 6 years through 11 years; 2 years through 5 years; and 6 months through 23 months. 
A descriptive efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued up to the data cutoff 
date of 21 February 2022 was performed in 5 476 participants 6 months through 5 years of age who 
received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=4 105) or placebo (n=1 371) and had a 
negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (referred to as the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy). Between 
participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences 
in demographics.  
The median length of follow-up for efficacy post-Dose 2 was 71 days for participants 2 years through 
5 years of age and 68 days for participants 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Vaccine efficacy in this study was observed during the period when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant 
was the predominant variant in circulation. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) in Part 2 for the Per Protocol Set for Efficacy for COVID-19 cases 14 days or 
more after dose 2 using the “COVID-19 P301 case definition” (i.e., the definition employed in the 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pivotal adult efficacy study) was 46.4% (95% CI: 19.8, 63.8) for children 2 years through 5 years of 
age and 31.5% (95% CI: -27.7, 62.0) for children 6 months through 23 months of age.  
Immunogenicity in children 6 months through 5 years of age 
For children aged 2 years through 5 years of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb responses in this Part 2 
per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 264; 25 micrograms) to those of young adults (n = 295; 
100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.014 (95% CI: 0.881, 1.167), meeting the noninferiority 
success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point estimate ≥ 0.8). The geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 for these children was 183.3 (95% CI: 164.03, 
204.91). The difference in seroresponse rates (SRR) between the children and young adults was -0.4% 
(95% CI: -2.7%, 1.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the SRR difference > -10%).  
For infants and toddlers from 6 months through 23 months of age, comparison of Day 57 nAb 
responses in this Part 2 per-protocol immunogenicity subset (n = 230; 25 micrograms) to those of 
young adults (n = 295; 100 micrograms) demonstrated a GMR of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.115, 1.470), 
meeting the noninferiority success criteria (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67; point 
estimate ≥ 0.8). The difference in SRR rates between the infants/toddlers and young adults was 0.7% 
(95% CI: -1.0%, 2.5%), also meeting the noninferiority success criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the seroresponse rate difference > -10%). 
Accordingly, the prespecified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met for 
both age groups, allowing efficacy of 25 micrograms to be inferred in both children 2 years through 
5 years and infants and toddlers aged 6 months through 23 months (Tables 6 and 7).

Immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients 
The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Spikevax (original) were evaluated in a two-part 
Phase 3b open-label study in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including kidney and liver 
transplants (mRNA-1273-P304). A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the 
dose authorised at the time of study conduct. 
In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT 
recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose. 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity in the study was assessed by measurement of neutralising antibodies against 
pseudovirus expressing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain at 1 month after Dose 2, Dose 3, 
booster dose and up to 12 months from the last dose in Part A, and up to 6 months from booster dose 
in Part B.  
Three doses of Spikevax (original) induced enhanced neutralising antibody titres compared to 
pre-dose 1 and post-dose 2. A higher proportion of SOT participants who had received three doses 
achieved seroresponse compared to participants who had received two doses. The neutralising 
antibody levels observed in SOT liver participants who had received three doses was comparable to 
the post-dose 2 responses observed in the immunocompetent, baseline SARS-CoV-2-negative adult 
participants. The neutralising antibody responses continued to be numerically lower post-dose 3 in 
SOT kidney participants compared to SOT liver participants. The neutralising levels observed one 
month after Dose 3 persisted through six months with antibody levels maintained at 26-fold higher and 
seroresponse rate at 67% compared to baseline. 
A fourth (booster) dose of Spikevax (original) enhanced neutralising antibody response in 
SOT participants compared to post-dose 3, regardless of the previous vaccines received [mRNA-1273 
(Moderna), BNT162b2 or any mRNA-containing combination]; however, SOT kidney participants 
had numerically lower neutralising antibody responses compared to SOT liver participants. 
Elderly 
Spikevax (original) was assessed in individuals 6 months of age and older, including 3 768 subjects 
65 years of age and older. The efficacy of Spikevax (original) was consistent between elderly 
(≥65 years) and younger adult subjects (18-64 years).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Spikevax (original) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of COVID-19 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
General toxicity 
General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the 
human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and 
transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated 
partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to 
humans is low. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of 
the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies 
were not performed.

Reproductive toxicity 
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of 
mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Spikevax (original) 
was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to 
mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal 
animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and 
offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo 
foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of Spikevax (original) 
vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

Handling instructions for the Spikevax XBB.1.5 pre-filled syringes 
•  Let each pre-filled syringe stand at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) for 15 minutes before 
administering. 
•  Do not shake. 
•  Pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration.  
•  Spikevax XBB.1.5 is a white to off-white dispersion. It may contain white or translucent product-
related particulates. Do not administer if vaccine is discoloured or contains other particulate 
matter. 
•  Needles are not included in the pre-filled syringe cartons.  
•  Use a sterile needle of the appropriate size for intramuscular injection (21-gauge or thinner 
needles). 
•  With tip cap upright, remove tip cap by twisting counter-clockwise until tip cap releases. Remove 
tip cap in a slow, steady motion. Avoid pulling tip cap while twisting. 
•  Attach the needle by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe.  
•  Uncap the needle when ready for administration. 
•  Administer the entire dose intramuscularly.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
- 
- 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Spikevax is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Spikevax  
3.  How Spikevax is given 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Spikevax 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Spikevax is and what it is used for 
Spikevax is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and 
children aged 6 months and older. The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles. 
As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID-19. 
How the vaccine works  
Spikevax stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the 
body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax uses a 
substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can 
use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike 
protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Spikevax 
The vaccine must not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax if: 
- 
you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Spikevax in the past.  
162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have a very weak or compromised immune system 
you have ever fainted following any needle injection. 
you have a bleeding disorder  
you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a 
mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold 
you have any serious illness  
if you have anxiety related to injections 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose.  
Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and 
fatal cases have been seen. 
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.  
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Spikevax. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels 
(capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low 
blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax. If you have previously had 
episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax.  
Duration of protection 
As with any vaccine, the primary 2-dose vaccination course of Spikevax may not fully protect all those 
who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children  
Spikevax is not recommended for children aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Spikevax 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Spikevax may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how 
Spikevax works. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax. The efficacy of Spikevax 
even after a third dose may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. In these cases, you 
should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close 
contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with 
your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. Spikevax can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from 
pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax during the second and third trimester have not shown 
negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or 
the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for 
miscarriage has been seen.  
163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Spikevax can be given during breastfeeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Spikevax contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is and what it is used for 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused 
by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and children aged 6 years and older. The active substance in 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The 
mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at 
least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
As Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 does not contain the virus, it cannot give you 
COVID-19. 
How the vaccine works  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). 
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes 
COVID-19. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic 
acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also 
on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This 
will help to protect you against COVID-19.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
The vaccine must not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Spikevax (original) in the past.  
you have a very weak or compromised immune system 
you have ever fainted following any needle injection. 
you have a bleeding disorder  
you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a 
mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold 
you have any serious illness  
if you have anxiety related to injections 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose.  
Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and 
fatal cases have been seen. 
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.  
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels 
(capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low 
blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax (original). If you have 
previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1.  
Duration of protection 
As with any vaccine, the third dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 may not fully protect 
all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is not recommended for children aged under 6 years. 
Other medicines and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 may affect the way other medicines work, and 
other medicines may affect how Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 works. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
178 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help 
prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss 
appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant 
women vaccinated with Spikevax (original) during the second and third trimester have not shown 
negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or 
the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no increased risk for 
miscarriage has been seen. Since differences between the two products are only related to the spike 
protein in the vaccine, and there are no clinically meaningful differences, Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 during breast 
feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 can be given during 
breastfeeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How you will be given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
Individuals 12 years of age and older 
The dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is 0.5 mL, given at least 3 months after the last 
prior dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Children 6 years through 11 years of age 
The dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is 0.25 mL, given at least 3 months after the 
last prior dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your 
upper arm. 
After each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for at least 
15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at 
least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19.  
For details on the primary vaccination course in individuals 6 years of age and older, see the Package 
Leaflet for Spikevax 0.2 mg/mL.

1.  What Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is and what it is used for 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused 
by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and children aged 6 months and older. The active substance in 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The 
mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles. 
As Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 does not contain the virus, it cannot give you 
COVID-19. 
How the vaccine works  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). 
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes 
COVID-19. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 uses a substance called messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein 
that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the 
virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
The vaccine must not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Spikevax (original) in the past.  
you have a very weak or compromised immune system 
you have ever fainted following any needle injection. 
you have a bleeding disorder  
you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a 
mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold 
you have any serious illness  
if you have anxiety related to injections 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose.  
Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and 
fatal cases have been seen.  
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.  
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels 
(capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low 
blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax (original). If you have 
previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5.  
Duration of protection 
As with any vaccine, the third dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may not fully 
protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is not recommended for children aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may affect the way other medicines work, and 
other medicines may affect how Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 works. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may be lower in people who are 
immunocompromised. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help 
prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss 
appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant 
women vaccinated with Spikevax (original) during the second and third trimester have not shown 
negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or 
the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no increased risk for 
miscarriage has been seen. Since differences between the two products are only related to the spike 
protein in the vaccine, and there are no clinically meaningful differences, Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during 
breast feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 can be given during 
breastfeeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily 
available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5.  
Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least 15 minutes after vaccination. 
There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 with other vaccines. Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 must not be mixed with 
other vaccines or medicinal products in the same syringe. 
Administration 
The vaccine must be administered intramuscularly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the 
upper arm. Do not administer this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. 
Multidose vials 
Pre-filled syringes 
Use a sterile needle of the appropriate size for intramuscular injection (21-gauge or thinner). With tip 
cap upright, remove tip cap by twisting counter-clockwise until tip cap releases. Remove tip cap in a 
slow, steady motion. Avoid pulling tip cap while twisting. Attach the needle by twisting in a clockwise 
direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Uncap the needle when ready for administration. 
Administer the entire dose intramuscularly. Discard syringe after use. For single-use only.

information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

1.  What Spikevax XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for 
Spikevax XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given 
to adults and children aged 6 months and older. The active substance in Spikevax XBB.1.5 is mRNA 
encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles. 
As Spikevax XBB.1.5 does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID-19. 
How the vaccine works  
Spikevax XBB.1.5 stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by 
causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax 
XBB.1.5 uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in 
the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies 
against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Spikevax XBB.1.5 
The vaccine must not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax XBB.1.5 if: 
- 
you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine 
203 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
injection or after you were given Spikevax (original) in the past.  
you have a very weak or compromised immune system 
you have ever fainted following any needle injection. 
you have a bleeding disorder  
you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a 
mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold 
you have any serious illness  
if you have anxiety related to injections 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).  
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose.  
Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and 
fatal cases have been seen.  
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.  
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Spikevax XBB.1.5. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels 
(capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low 
blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax (original). If you have 
previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax XBB.1.5.  
Duration of protection 
As with any vaccine, the additional dose of Spikevax XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who 
receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. 
Children  
Spikevax XBB.1.5 is not recommended for children aged under 6 months. 
Other medicines and Spikevax XBB.1.5 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Spikevax XBB.1.5 may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may 
affect how Spikevax XBB.1.5 works. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy of Spikevax XBB.1.5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. In these 
cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, 
your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual 
recommendations with your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax XBB.1.5 during 
pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax 
(original) during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or 
the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination 
during the first trimester is limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Since differences 
204 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the two products are only related to the spike protein in the vaccine, and there are no 
clinically meaningful differences, Spikevax XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. 
No data are available yet regarding the use of Spikevax XBB.1.5 during breast feeding.  
However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were 
breastfeeding after vaccination with Spikevax (original) have not shown a risk for adverse effects in 
breastfed newborns/infants. Spikevax XBB.1.5 can be given during breastfeeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  
Spikevax XBB.1.5 contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

Handling instructions for the pre-filled syringes 
•  Let each pre-filled syringe stand at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) for 15 minutes before 
administering. 
•  Do not shake. 
•  Pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration.  
•  Spikevax XBB.1.5 is a white to off-white dispersion. It may contain white or translucent product-
related particulates. Do not administer if vaccine is discoloured or contains other particulate 
matter. 
•  Needles are not included in the pre-filled syringe cartons.  
•  Use a sterile needle of the appropriate size for intramuscular injection (21-gauge or thinner 
needles). 
•  With tip cap upright, remove tip cap by twisting counter-clockwise until tip cap releases. Remove 
tip cap in a slow, steady motion. Avoid pulling tip cap while twisting. 
•  Attach the needle by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe.  
•  Uncap the needle when ready for administration. 
•  Administer the entire dose intramuscularly.  
•  After thawing, do not refreeze.

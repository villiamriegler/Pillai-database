Introduction 
On 28 September 2015, the MAH submitted the final study report of study DTPa-HBV-IPV-114 for 
Infanrix hexa, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study 106793 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-114) is a standalone study. The main objective of 
the study was to determine the persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B from childhood to 
adolescence that was conferred by infant vaccination with Infanrix hexa as part of routine vaccination 
in Germany: three doses of primary vaccination received by 9 months of age and one booster dose 
received between 11 and 18 months of age. 
In the global context of vaccination against hepatitis B, the EMA has requested GSK Biologicals to set 
up a long-term surveillance programme of vaccines containing a recombinant hepB component. 
A long-term surveillance programme was requested because combination of more antigens in a vaccine 
can result in antigenic “interference”, resulting in a lower immune response than achieved by 
monovalent vaccines. This has been noted in the past with HBV combination products, therefore this is 
thoroughly followed for this vaccine (Infanrix hexa). 
This study is the third in a series of four studies constituting a common immunological follow-up 
program in healthy subjects who had received four consecutive doses of Infanrix hexa: 
•  DTPA-HBV-IPV-112: subjects of 4-5 years of age (study report of 04 December 2008). 
•  DTPA-HBV-IPV-113: subjects of 7-8 years of age (study report of 28 March 2012). 
•  DTPA-HBV-IPV-114: subjects of 12-13 years of age (study report of 17 August 2015). 
•  DTPA-HBV-IPV-115: subjects of 14-15 years of age (planned study). 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
A single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B Kinder, Expiry date: 31 January 2015) 
was given to children who received routine vaccination in the year 2001-2002 with Infanrix hexa and 
had reached the age of 12 to 13 years by 2014. One dose (0.5 ml) contained 10 mcg HBsAg 
(hepatitis B surface antigen) adsorbed on 0.25 mg aluminium as aluminium hydroxide. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study 106793 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-114), an open-label, phase IV, multicentre study to assess the 
long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immunogenicity and safety of a single 
dose hepatitis B (Engerix™-B Kinder) vaccine challenge in adolescents aged 12-13 years (from and 
including the 12th birthday up to but excluding the 14th birthday), previously primed and boosted in the 
first two years of life with four doses of GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix™ hexa) vaccine.

1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study 106793 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-114), an open-label, phase IV, multicentre study to assess 
the long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immunogenicity and 
safety of a single dose hepatitis B (Engerix™-B Kinder) vaccine challenge in adolescents 
aged 12-13 years, previously primed and boosted in the first two years of life with four 
doses of GSK Biologicals’ DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix™ hexa) vaccine. 
Description 
This was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre study in Germany with a single group, 
with all subjects receiving a single challenge dose of HBV vaccine. Two blood samples were collected, 
one before the administration of the single challenge dose of HBV vaccine and a second sample 
approximately one month after the single challenge dose of HBV vaccine. Safety data was collected up 
to 30 days after administration of the study vaccine. 
The first subject was enrolled in the study on 18 February 2014 and the last study visit was on 23 
September 2014.

- 
The anti-HBs antibody response, in terms of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 100 
mIU/ml, to a single challenge dose of HBV vaccine (Engerix-B Kinder) in subjects 12–13 years 
of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix hexa in the first two years of life, was 
assessed.  
Secondary objective 
Immunogenicity 
- 
The persistence of anti-HBs antibodies, in terms of seroprotection status and antibody 
concentrations, in subjects 12–13 years of age, previously vaccinated with four doses of

two years of life, was assessed. 
Safety 
- 
The safety and reactogenicity of a single challenge dose of HBV vaccine (Engerix-B Kinder) in 
terms of solicited symptoms (local and general), unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse 
events (SAEs), was evaluated.

Sample size 
A total of 300 subjects were vaccinated and all subjects completed the study and were therefore 
included in the ATP cohort for safety. Seven subjects were excluded and therefore 293 subjects were 
included in the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity and antibody persistence. 
The study was adequately powered to lead to a LL of the 95% CI not more than 5% below that true 
percentage (i.e. a LL above 91% to 93%, respectively). For instance, if the true percentage of 
response to the HBV vaccine challenge is 97%, a sample size of 270 subjects provided a power of at 
least 93% for the LL of the 95% CI, for the percentage of subjects who have responded to the HBV 
vaccine challenge (i.e. anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml one month after HBV vaccine 
challenge) to be more than 92%.

Statistical Methods 
ATP cohort for analysis of safety 
All vaccinated subjects: 
•  who have received the challenge dose of study vaccine 
• 
for whom administration site of study vaccine was known and was according to protocol and 
•  who have not received a vaccine not specified or forbidden in the protocol. 
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
All subjects from the ATP cohort for analysis of safety: 
•  who met all eligibility criteria 
•  who complied with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol  
•  who did not meet any of the elimination criteria during the study 
• 
for whom post-vaccination immunogenicity (Visit 2) results were available. 
The interval between vaccination at Visit 1 and blood sampling at Visit 2, considered for inclusion of a 
subject in the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, was 21-48 days. 
ATP cohort for analysis of antibody persistence 
All enrolled subjects: 
• 
aged 12–13 years (from and including the 12th birthday up to but excluding the 14th birthday) 
at the time of enrolment. 
•  who had not received any additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine (or any other vaccine with this 
antigen component) other than the four doses of Infanrix hexa during the first two years of 
life. 
•  with no evidence of hepatitis B infection or disease (including anti-HBc at post-HBV challenge 
dose time point). 
• 
for whom serological results were available at the pre-HBV challenge blood sampling time 
point. 
Derived and transformed data 
•  A seronegative subject was a subject with anti-HBs antibody concentration below the assay 
cut-off (< 6.2 mIU/ml).

•  A seropositive subject was a subject with anti-HBs antibody concentrations above the assay 
cut-off (≥ 6.2 mIU/ml). 
•  A seroprotected subject was a subject with anti-HBs antibody concentrations above the 
protection level ≥ 10 mIU/ml. 
•  Anamnestic response to the single challenge dose was defined as:  
o  At least (i.e. greater than or equal to) 4-fold rise in post-vaccination anti-HBs antibody 
concentrations in subjects seropositive at the pre-vaccination time point. 
o  Post-vaccination, anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml in subjects 
seronegative at the pre-vaccination time point.  
• 
• 
The Geometric Mean antibody concentration (GMC) calculations were performed by taking the 
anti-log of the mean of the log10 concentration transformations. All subjects were considered. 
Subjects whose antibody concentrations were below the cut-off of the assay were given an 
arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation. 
For a given subject and a given immunogenicity measurement, missing or nonevaluable 
measurements were not be replaced. Therefore, an analysis excluded subjects with missing or 
non-evaluable measurements.

CHMP’s comment 
The data on anti-HBs antibody response after the challenge dose are obtained from 291 subjects pre-
challenge and 289 subjects post-challenge, whereas the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
consisted of 293 subjects. Hence, data were not available from 2 subjects pre-challenge and 4 
subjects post-challenge, and this absence of data is not further explained.

The anamnestic response to the hepatitis B challenge dose was mounted by 96.5% of subjects [93.7; 
98.3]. 
CHMP’s  comment 
The generated immunogenicity data are consistent with previous data on Engerix-B Junior as a 
booster vaccine. 
Safety results 
• 
Solicited local and general symptoms 
Pain at the injection site was the most frequent solicited local symptom (44.0%). The most frequent 
Grade 3 solicited local symptom reported was swelling at the injection site (0.7%).

Fatigue and headache were the most frequent solicited general symptom (24.3% and 23.7%, resp.). 
Fever occurred in 7 out of 300 subjects, with one subject reporting temperature >38°C and one 
subject reporting temperature >38.5°C. 
• 
Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) 
During the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-vaccination period: 
-  At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 14.7% of subjects. 
- 
- 
- 
The most frequently reported unsolicited symptom was upper respiratory tract infection, which 
was reported for 3.3% of the subjects. 
The following unsolicited symptoms of Grade 3 intensity were reported for 0.3% of subject 
each: abdominal pain, pyrexia, gastrointestinal infection, contusion, headache and cough. 
The following unsolicited symptoms, reported for 0.3% of subject each, were considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination: vertigo and urticaria. These adverse events 
are already mentioned in the SmPC of Engerix-B Junior. 
• 
SAEs 
No fatal events were reported in this study. 
Two SAEs were reported during the study, which were not considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to the vaccination: contusion of lumbar spine and fracture of right forearm.

CHMP’s  comment 
The generated safety data are consistent with previous data on Engerix-B Junior as a booster vaccine. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current study investigated the HepB antibody persistence in 300 healthy 12 to 13-year-old 
adolescents who were previously vaccinated during infancy with 3 doses in their 1th year of life and a 
fourth dose in their 2nd year of life Infanrix hexa.  
One month after the challenge dose of HBV vaccine, more than 90% of subjects (94.1% [90.7; 96.5]) 
had a booster response ≥ 100 mIU/ml and more than 95% of subjects (97.6% [95.1;99]) were 
seroprotected, while 96.5% [93.7; 98.3] of subjects mounted an anamnestic response. 
Before the challenge dose of HBV vaccine, about 60% of subjects (60.8% [54.9; 66.4]) were still 
seroprotected at the age of 12 to 13 years. 
For long-term protection against HBV, the boosterability (indicating immune memory) is more 
important than the persistence of antibodies. The study showed good boosterability which indicates 
long-term protection up to the age of 12-13. 
The challenge dose of HBV vaccine was generally well tolerated.  
Pain at the injection site was the most frequent solicited local symptom (44.0%) and the most frequent 
Grade 3 solicited local symptom reported was swelling at the injection site (0.7%). Fatigue and 
headache were the most frequent solicited general symptom (24.3% and 23.7%, resp.). Fever 
occurred in 7 out of 300 subjects, with one subject reporting temperature >38°C and one subject 
reporting temperature >38.5°C. Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 14.7% of the subjects during 
the 31-day follow-up period. 
Two SAEs were reported during the study, which were not considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to the vaccination: contusion of lumbar spine and fracture of right forearm.  
No fatal events were reported in this study. 
2.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled, and no further regulatory action is needed. 
The provided data do not cause concern regarding efficacy or safety of Infanrix hexa. 
The benefit/risk balance of Infanrix hexa therefore remains positive. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

Additional clarifications requested 
Not applicable. 
MS comments:  
The conclusions of the Rapporteur are endorsed. In addition, in order to put this study in a clinical 
perspective it is suggested to add in the AR that a long-term surveillance programme was requested 
because combination of more antigens in a vaccine can result in antigenic “interference”, resulting in a 
lower immune response than achieved by  monovalent vaccines. This has been noted in the past with 
HBV combination products, therefor this is thoroughly followed for this vaccine (Infanrix hexa). 
Furthermore it is recommended to mention that for long-term protection against HBV, the 
boosterability (indicating immune memory) is more import than the persistence of antibodies. The 
study showed good boosterability which indicates that there is a long-term protection up to the age of 
12-13. 
Response to MS comment: 
The MS comment is endorsed and the suggestions have been added to the AR for additional clarity.

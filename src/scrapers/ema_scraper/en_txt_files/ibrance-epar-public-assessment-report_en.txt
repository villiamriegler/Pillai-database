1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Limited submitted on 30 July 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ibrance, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) 
and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed 
upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 September 2013. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
IBRANCE in combination with endocrine therapy is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced/metastatic breast 
cancer: 
- with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women 
- with fulvestrant in women who have received prior therapy 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
palbociclib was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/0001/2015 
on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having varied responses to anti-hormonal and 
chemotherapy treatments. Breast tumor types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, with one 
third of tumors being ER-negative and two thirds of tumors being ER-positive. Berry, et al 1 have shown in a 
meta-analysis of node-positive patients in the adjuvant setting that while patients with ER-positive tumors who 
receive adjuvant hormonal therapy have better disease-free and overall survival than their counterparts with 
ER-negative tumors, advances in chemotherapy in the ER-negative setting have lessened the survival 
differences between these 2 groups. In this way, ER status is a strong predictive factor in identifying patients 
who may benefit from endocrine therapy. 
ER-positive tumors make up 65% of tumors in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumors in women older 
than 65 years. These cancers are largely estrogen driven in postmenopausal women where the main source of 
the tumor’s estrogen is from conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase enzyme action.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed in 
2012.  This cancer represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women2.  In Europe, 
there were an estimated 464,000 new cases of breast cancer (female) in 2012 and an estimated 131,000 deaths 
from the disease3.   
2.1.3.  Biologic features and clinical presentation  
The Rb pathway in breast cancer was recently described in a publication by Witkiewicz and Knudsen. In 
summary it is noted that in ER-positive breast cancer, Rb pathway deregulation is generally due to aberrant 
Cyclin D1 expression or amplification leading to deregulation of CDK4/6, while in triple-negative disease for 
example, loss of the Rb gene or protein is the main mechanism (Figure xxx). It might therefore be assumed that 
Rb itself may not be a useful biomarker for screening of patients with ER-positive disease due to the low 
expected frequency of Rb loss in this population. Nevertheless, in the present pivotal study 1008 (PALOMA-2), 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of Rb was conducted. The results in this subgroup are presented under 
Clinical Efficacy. 
While the major activity of palbociclib is thought to be through the inhibition of the CDK4/CDK6/Cyclin D1 
complex and downstream activity of Rb, the CDK4/CDK6 complex has been shown to have some 
Rb-independent activities (Musgrove et al, 2011) including the regulation of TSC2/mTOR pathway (Goel et al, 
2016), and the regulation of FOXM1 (Castellano et al, 2016). Mechanistically, one can also hypothesize that the 
absence of Rb in a given tumour does not preclude the compensatory expression of other Rb family members 
(such as p107 and p130) (Dannenberg, 2004 and Stengel et al, 2009). Tumour cells in the absence of Rb may

rely on an alternative pathway(s) in the CDK4/6 signalling process, for example, CDK4/SMAD3 may play a role 
in cell proliferation as well (Matsuura et al 2004). 
2.1.4.  Management 
Recommendations from the American Society of  Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines, the European 
School  of  Oncology-European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology  (ESO-ESMO)  2nd  International  Consensus 
Guidelines  for  Advanced  Breast  Cancer  (ABC2),  and  the  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN) 
Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in  Oncology  recommend  endocrine  therapy  as  the  preferred  first-line  treatment 
option  for  hormone  receptor-positive,  HER2-negative  advanced  breast  cancer  (except  for  immediately 
life-threatening  disease  or  when  concerns  exist  regarding  endocrine  resistance) 4 , 5 , 6.  The  choice  between 
endocrine therapies for the initial treatment is often driven by prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, potential side 
effects, time to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal status. 
Currently,  first-line  treatment  in  the  ER-positive,  HER2-negative  advanced  breast  cancer  postmenopausal 
population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, and 
tamoxifen6 with time to progression and prolongation of PFS ranging from 5 to 15 months.6,7,8  
Modification of oestrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease 
and limited tumour-related symptoms9. 
Presently, second and subsequent lines of therapy in the hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer 
population typically include endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, steroidal or nonsteroidal AIs, 
progestins, and androgens6. In the pivotal studies for the present application, letrozole and fulvestrant were 
used as endocrine backbone therapy and comparators.  
Letrozole  (Femara)  is  an  oral  nonsteroidal  aromatase  inhibitor  (AI)  approved  worldwide  for  the  first-line 
treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.   
Fulvestrant  (Faslodex)  is  a  potent  anti-oestrogen  drug  that  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
postmenopausal  women  with  metastatic  hormone  receptor-positive  breast  cancer  following  the  failure  of 
anti-oestrogen therapy.   
In addition, postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that have 
progressed after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole may also receive everolimus (Afinitor) in combination 
with exemestane.  
Chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance6.

About the product 
Palbociclib (also referred to as PD-0332991 and PF-00080665) is an oral, selective and reversible inhibitor of 
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). Palbociclib has the molecular formula of C24H29N7O2 and 
a molecular weight of 447.54 Daltons. 
During cell proliferation, the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle is under the control of CDKs which are activated 
through specific complex formation with regulatory cyclins.  CDK 4 and CDK 6 are activated by binding to Cyclin 
D in early G1 phase. Phosphorylation of pRb and other members of the pocket protein family (p107 and p130) 
by active cyclin-CDK complexes leads to release of E2F and DP transcription factors and transcription of S-phase 
genes. This leads to subsequent cell cycle G1/S transition for initiation of cell proliferation10. Inhibition of CDK 
4/cyclin D1 (CCND1) kinase activity as well as CDK 6/cyclin D1 kinase would prevent DNA synthesis and thus 
inhibits cell division.  
Figure 1 - CDK4/6 Cell Cycle Pathway 
Greater than 90% of human tumours subvert these control mechanisms through a variety of genetic and 
biochemical adaptations including up-regulation of CDK4/CDK6, amplification of the D-type cyclins, or 
down-regulation of p16INK4A, an endogenous inhibitor of CDK4/CDK6. Thus, tumours that depend on the 
activity of CDK4 for proliferation and survival may be highly sensitive to inhibition of this pathway.  
There is a strong link between the action of oestradiol and cellular proliferation. Anti-oestrogen-induced growth 
arrest of ER+ breast cancer cells is accompanied by decreased cyclinD1. In ER+ cancer cell lines, combination 
treatment with palbociclib and anti-oestrogen agents led to increased inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell 
proliferation, and also enhanced the induction of senescence11. Mechanistically, the combination benefit may 
arise from the convergent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation via two routes – direct repression of CDK4/CDK6

activity by palbociclib, and indirect inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 following reduction of cyclinD1 levels by 
anti-oestrogen agents.12  
The combination of palbociclib with tamoxifen has also been tested in vitro in ER-positive human breast cancer 
cell lines indicating a synergistic interaction11.Taken together, this evidence provided a biologic rationale for 
evaluating the combination of palbociclib with antihormonal therapy in patients with ER-positive, HER-2 
negative breast cancer.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of palbociclib is 6-acetyl-8-cyclopentyl-5-methyl-2-{[5-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2- 
yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one corresponding to the molecular formula C24H29N7O2. It has a 
relative molecular weight of 447.54 Daltons and the following structure: 
Figure 2. Chemical structure of palbociclib. 
Palbociclib is an achiral molecule. The molecular structure of palbociclib has been confirmed by a combination of 
spectroscopic data. Evidence of key functional groups was provided by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Mass 
spectrometry (ESI- MS and ESI-MS/MS) was used for the determination of the mass for the molecular ion and 
assignment of ions in the mass spectrum. The proton (1H NMR) and carbon (13C NMR) nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy were used to assign protons to each corresponding carbon, proton to proton 
assignments, and distinguish between the CH and CH 2 signals. The molecular structure of palbociclib was 
independently confirmed using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectrum is consistent with the 
compound structure.

The active substance is a non-hygroscopic yellow to orange crystalline powder that is classified as BCS Class II 
compound based on the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. It is slightly soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and 
dimethylformamide, very slightly soluble in methanol and water.  
Palbociclib isethionate was prepared and used for toxicology and clinical studies through Phase 2. However, its 
physical properties were deemed unsuitable for commercial development. Therefore, the free base of 
palbociclib, which was found to have excellent physical and chemical stability, was selected for commercial use.  
Palbociclib exhibits polymorphism. The crystalline anhydrous Form A of palbociclib free base is the 
thermodynamically more stable form within the temperature ranges that are relevant to manufacturing and 
storage conditions and was the form selected for development and commercialisation.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Palbociclib is synthesized in six main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
The starting materials were redefined during the evaluation upon request from the CHMP. Their redefinition was 
requested on the basis that the originally proposed starting materials were the result of a custom made 
synthesis and the limited steps carried out under GMP hindered the regulatory oversight to ensure the quality of 
the active substance throughout the product lifecycle. These are now considered intermediates.  
The control strategy for non-critical steps includes a list of non-critical parameters and their respective 
acceptable ranges. Design spaces have not been claimed as an element of control strategy in non-critical steps.  
The control strategy for critical steps includes a design space that is represented by the acceptable ranges of the 
process parameters. 
In-process controls (IPC) have been described together with specifications for isolated intermediates. 
An enhanced development program in line with ICH Q8 and ICH Q11 was conducted for the development of 
palbociclib. A structured quality risk management approach was employed, to identify potentially critical 
material attributes and critical process parameters and assess their impact on drug substance quality based on 
knowledge gained through development of palbociclib and scientific literature. The active substance critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) were identified based on the understanding of the drug product quality target product 
profile (QTPP).  
The critical process parameters were also identified.Although the applicant proposed proven acceptable ranges 
(PAR) for the critical process steps in the original submission, during the review the applicant agreed to register 
the process parameter ranges in these critical steps as design spaces. This was supported by univariate and 
multivariate studies. 
No design space was claimed for the chemical steps from the newly defined starting materials as these steps are 
considered non-critical. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. A discussion on potential impurities that may arise from starting materials, 
side-reaction or degradation has been provided. This also included a detailed explanation of the origin, fate, 
purge and control of these impurities, including genotoxic impurities. In this regard, a structure-based 
assessment was performed on all starting materials, intermediates and impurities in the palbociclib commercial 
manufacturing process. The structures were evaluated to identify potentially genotoxic impurities. Based on this 
assessment, there are no genotoxicity safety concerns for any impurities of the active pharmaceutical

ingredient. In addition, since palbocliclib is intended to treat patients with advanced breast cancer, ICH M7 does 
not apply. The limits for each specified impurity are in line with ICH Q3A or suitably justified. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program.  Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.  
Palbociclib isethionate was prepared and used for toxicology and clinical studies through Phase 2. However, its 
physical properties were deemed unsuitable for commercial development. Therefore, the free base of 
palbociclib, which was found to have adequate physical and chemical stability, was selected for commercial use. 
The active substance is packaged in two sealed, low density polyethylene (LDPE) antistatic liners. The bagged 
material is then inserted in a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. The LDPE liner is suitable for 
pharmaceutical or “in contact with food” use. It complies with Regulation 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, particle size (laser light diffraction), 
identification (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF), residual solvents (GC, HPLC), inorganic impurities: 
residue on ignition (Ph Eur), palladium content (ICP-OES) and heavy metals (Ph Eur), and organic impurities 
(RP-HPLC). 
The active substance specification was established based on understanding of the finished product Quality 
Target Product Profile (QTPP) (see pharmaceutical development section) and the active substance critical quality 
attributes (CQA). The CQA identified are: identification, assay, impurities, residual solvents, palladium, heavy 
metals, residue on ignition, water and particle size. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The omission of a test for polymorphism was justified based on the fact that Form A is the thermodynamically 
favoured form under relevant manufacturing and storage conditions, the supportive batch analysis data and 
primary stability studies which showed no changes after 18 months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH.  
The omission of tests for certain residual solvents has been justified based on batch analysis data from the 
commercial process or the previous process. 
The omission of microbiological testing has also been justified. Palbociclib is a non-sterile active substance. The 
manufacturing process includes multiple steps which are able to reduce most microorganisms. Omission of 
microbiological testing is also supported by batch data for release of clinical and registration lots.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on several batches palbociclib manufactured according to a previous process (which differed 
from the one proposed for commercial use, but is considered equivalent to the commercial process) and several 
batches from the commercial process at pilot and commercial scale were provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three primary stability pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer, 
produced according to a previous process (equivalent to the proposed commercial process) and stored in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 16/140 
  
  
intended commercial package for 18 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Supportive stability data were also provided from two pilot scale batches synthesized using two previous 
processes and a pilot scale batch manufactured using the commercial process stored for up to 24 months at 25 
ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH, respectively. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities, water content and solid form (PXRD). The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release, with the addition of PXRD, and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes or trends were observed in any of the parameters tested through 18 months and 6 
months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH and 40 °C/75% RH, respectively, compared to the initial values.  
Results under stress conditions were also provided on batches manufactured according to different synthetic 
routes used during development exposed to high temperature and high humidity.  One of those batches was also 
subjected to high temperature and low humidity. No significant change in appearance, assay, or purity was 
observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Samples were tested for 
appearance, identification, assay and impurities. All parameters remained unchanged versus the dark control 
confirming that palbociclib is not light sensitive. 
Samples of palbociclib were also evaluated under forced degradation conditions to identify the primary 
degradation products and to evaluate the suitability of the assay and purity methods. Individual samples of the 
solid drug substance or solutions of active substance were exposed to acid, base, oxidation, heat, and simulated 
sunlight. Samples were tested for assay and impurities.  Degradation was only observed in the hydrogen 
peroxide and AAPH studies.  No significant degradation was observed for acidic or basic conditions.  In the solid 
state, no significant degradation was observed under elevated temperatures or light exposure.  The assay and 
purity method for palbociclib drug substance was shown to be specific, selective and stability-indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months without any storage precaution 
packaged and sealed in LDPE anti-static liners within a HDPE drum.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Palbociclib is provided as immediate release hard gelatin capsules using a common blend in dosage strengths of: 
75 mg (Size #2, light orange body/ light orange cap) in which the body is printed with “PBC 75” and the cap 
printed with “Pfizer” in white; 100 mg (Size #1, light orange body/caramel cap) in which the body is printed with 
“PBC 100” and the cap printed with “Pfizer” in white; and 125 mg (Size # 0, caramel body/caramel cap) in which 
the body is printed with “PBC 125” and the cap printed with “Pfizer” in white. 
The drug product is packaged in polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) /aluminum foil blister system or in high 
density polyethylene bottles. 
An enhanced development approach was used for the design and development of palbociclib drug product. A 
combination of risk based assessments, laboratory studies, and manufacturing experience across a range of 
scales and equipment types has been used using QbD principles to gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
formulation and process conditions and their impact on the quality attributes of the palbociclib drug product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 17/140 
  
  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as immediate release capsules for once a day oral 
administration containing 75 mg, 100 mg and 125 mg of palbociclib, that meet compendial and other relevant 
quality standards, have a minimum shelf life of 24 months and are packaged in polychlorotrifluoroethylene 
(PCTFE)/aluminium foil unit dose blisters or HDPE bottles. The strengths should be differentiated by capsule 
shell size, colour and printing. 
As mentioned above, palbociclib is a BCS Class II compound (low solubility and high permeability). The 
maximum dose of 125 mg does not fully dissolve in 250 mL of media over the range of pH 1 to pH 6.8, but can 
be fully dissolved at pH values below 4.3. 
As indicated in the active substance section of this report, crystalline anhydrous Form A of palbociclib free base 
was selected for development as it was the thermodynamically most stable form at room temperature. All Phase 
III clinical supplies and registration stability batches used crystalline anhydrous Form A of the free base. 
The active substance particle size is controlled in the active substance specification. Dissolution and 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to examine the impact of particle size of palbociclib free base on the 
dissolution and relative bioavailability of the capsules.  It was concluded that the active substance particle size 
does not impact finished product relative bioavailability, dissolution and stability within the proposed 
commercial active substance particle size specification. 
An excipient compatibility screening study with conventional immediate release formulation excipients was 
completed under accelerated stability conditions using binary mixtures of the active substance and excipient 
formed into compacts.  All excipients selected for the commercial formulation are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Namely, 
microcrystalline cellulose and spray dried lactose monohydrate are used as diluents; sodium starch glycolate as 
disintegrant; magnesium stearate as lubricant; and colloidal silicon dioxide as glidant. 
Supporting development data and registration stability studies demonstrated the suitability of the selected 
excipients. 
The history of the formulations used in the clinical program was also described. The differences between those 
clinical formulations were explained (salt vs free base, minor changes in manufacturing process, development 
sites versus commercial site).  
Early clinical trials (pivotal study 1003) used capsules containing the palbociclib isethionate salt active substance 
(manufactured at the development sites).  
To support Phase 3 clinical studies, formulated capsules containing the free base drug substance form were 
developed. With the exception of capsule shell printing, the final Phase 3 free base capsule formulation is 
qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent to the registration stability and proposed commercial product. 
Bioequivalence between the isethionate capsule taken under fasted condition and the proposed commercial free 
base capsule taken under fed condition was demonstrated in pivotal bioavailability Study 1036. Bioequivalence 
in the fasted state was demonstrated between initial Phase 3 free base and final Phase 3 free base in Study 
1020. Based on the data submitted, provided commercial formulation is taken with food, as recommended in the 
SmPC 4.2. Method of administration) bioequivalence is considered demonstrated between the different 
formulations (for details on bioequivalence studies and discussion on food effect, see clinical section of this 
report).  
Overall, a satisfactory justification has been presented with regards to the choice of the dissolution media and 
parameters. Dissolution profiles for commercial batches of the three strengths (registration stability batches)

using the proposed quality control dissolution method have been provided. All profiles are similar and meet the 
proposed specification. 
For each unit operation a risk assessment was conducted to determine potential relationships between related 
process parameters and quality attributes of the finished product. The critical process parameters have been 
adequately identified. Apost-approval change management protocol (PACMP) to qualify an alternative drug 
product encapsulator for the production of palbociclib capsules 75, 100 and 125 mg at the proposed 
manufacturing site has been submitted and is considered acceptable. 
The scale up strategy has been adequately described.  
The primary packaging is polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE)/PVC blisters with 
aluminum foil backing and high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) closures. The 
material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Palbociclib immediate release 75 mg, 100 mg, and 125 mg capsules are manufactured using a standard 
manufacturing processwhich includes blending, milling, dry granulation, encapsulation and packaging using 
equipment commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry.   All strengths are manufactured from a common 
blend. 
The manufacturing process has been described with sufficient detail in terms of equipment and process 
parameters (critical and non-critical process parameters). The proposed ranges for process parameters have 
been established in a multivariate manner. Although the applicant initially did not claim a design space, during 
the review it was agreed that they represented a design space. Data provided in pharmaceutical development 
are sufficient to support the proposed ranges. In view of the fact that DoEs have been conducted at industrial 
scale (40 – 100% of the commercial scale) supported by satisfactory scale up discussion, no design space 
verification was deemed necessary. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Since palbociclib capsules are manufactured by a standard manufacturing process, no formal process validation 
data has been included in the dossier. A process validation scheme has been presented in 3.2.R. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual), identification (LC-retention time, LC-UV Spectra), assay (LC), degradation products (LC), dissolution, 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), microbial limits (Total Aerobic Microbial Count, Total 
Yeasts and Escherichia coli) (Ph Eur). 
This specification is also applicable to stability testing for the following stability indicating tests: appearance, 
assay, degradation products, dissolution, and microbial limits. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.  Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several batches palbociclib capsules manufactured at different stages of 
development confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  batches  of  palbociclib  capsules  from  each  strength  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
manufacturing site, stored for 18 months under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30°C/75% RH) 
conditions at and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. All batches have identical drug product composition, were manufactured using the 
commercial process described and were stored in container closure systems representative of the commercial 
packaging (HDPE bottles and PCTFE/Aluminium foil blister).  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay by HPLC, degradation products by HPLC, dissolution, water content 
and microbiological quality. Tests for water content and microbial enumeration were performed for information 
only. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The stability data show there is no significant effect on the physical and chemical characteristics of capsules 
stored in HDPE bottles or in blister at the studied conditions. The level of the main degradant increases slightly 
at  intermediate  and  accelerated  conditions  after  18  months.  Nevertheless,  the  values  found  remained  well 
within the specification limits under all conditions at all points.  
Water content, which was monitored for information only, also increased on storage, but remained below the 
release specification. No consistent trends were observed for other attributes. 
Supportive stress studies were performed on palbociclib 100 mg capsules stored in an open glass container 
included thermal, thermal and humidity, and photolysis exposure. These studies confirm that the assay and 
purity method is selective and stability indicating. Mass balance after treatment was close to 100% recovery for 
all samples. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation 
products, dissolution and water content. No significant changes were observed in any of the parameters tested 
for  photostability  study.  Two  degradation  products  observed  under  the  strong  light  conditions  used  in  the 
degradation study were not observed in the registration photostability study. Therefore, the drug product is 
considered as photo-stable and no precautionary packaging or labeling is required. 
An in-use open bottle study was carried out on one batch of each strength in HDPE bottles. The bottles were 
opened, with the cap and seal removed and stored at 30 °C/75% RH for 30 days. Samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, and water content. No significant changes in chemical or 
physical stability were observed except for water content that but remained within the specifications. No in-use 
restriction is required as all the results met the acceptance criteria. 
A bulk holding time study is being conducted to establish a period of time in which the bulk capsules can be held 
without  additional  retesting  conducted  prior  to  packaging.  The  data  do  not  show  any  negative  impact  and 
support the proposed holding time of 18 months.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the gelatine 
used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The proposed redefined starting materials for the synthesis of palbociclib are considered acceptable. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the 
development of the active substance and finished product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have 
been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the active substance and finished product. A combination 
of risk assessments, laboratory studies, and manufacturing experience across a range of scales and equipment 
types has resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the formulation and process conditions and their impact 
on the quality attributes of the finished product. A PACMP to qualify an alternative drug product encapsulator for 
the production of palbociclib capsules at the proposed manufacturing site has been submitted. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Palbociclib nonclinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology were studied. The 
applicant indicated that pivotal safety studies were executed under GLP. 
The applicant has received several CHMP advices. Two of these involve non-clinical questions. In the advice 
given in 2012 the applicant requested the committee’s view on the non-clinical program in relation to the 
intended indication. At this time the CHMP agreed that the completed and planned non-clinical studies would be 
sufficient for an MAA.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Biochemical characterization 
The binding and inhibition data show that palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4 and CDK6 with a 50% 
inhibitory concentration of between 0.011 and 0.015 µM for CDK4/6 and their ligands.   
In a broader panel of kinase also binding to other, off-target, kinases was observed with CLK1 showing the 
highest inhibition at the lowest concentration (clinically relevant).  
Cell line characterization 
Palbociclib was tested in vitro on molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines. Results from these 
experiments indicated that those cell lines that are more sensitive to palbociclib anti-proliferative effects have 
low levels of CDKN2A and high levels of pRb and CCND1, while resistant cell lines showed the opposite 
characteristics. Sensitive cell lines in this panel represented mostly the luminal ER-positive subtype13. 
From a functional point of view, palbociclib arrests the cell cycle at G1, inhibits cell proliferation and induces 
senescence in a broad panel of Rb+ cancer cell lines. 
The data shows that palbociclib increases the percentage of cell in G1 with increased exposure. However, in cell 
lines which lack a functional Rb no effect were observed.  
When combined with fulvestrant an additive effect was observed compared with either drug alone. Also, the data 
suggests that the additive effects is due to the direct repression of CDK4/6 by palbociclib and the reduction of 
cyclinD1 (ligand to CDK4/6) by the anti-oestrogen drugs. Combination studies also show that cultures released 
from drugs for four days retained a significant inhibition of DNA synthesis in comparison to single-drug cultures.    
In vivo 
Anti-tumour activity was registered by tumour growth delays in tumour bearing mice. The data also shows that 
palbociclib exhibit no activity in Rb-negative tumours, reinforcing the in vitro observations that intact Rb is 
critical for palbociclib activity. This is also substantiated by data showing correlation between phospho-Rb 
inhibition, drug steady state PK and anti-tumour activity.  
When combined with letrozole palbociclib led to near-tumour stasis in a transplanted human tumour murine 
model. The data also shows that combination treatment enhances the modification of Rb in comparison to single 
agent treatment. The PK data from this study also suggests no evidence of drug:drug interaction, confirming 
that the potentiation observed from this combination is not due to increased drug exposure. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary PD shows that palbociclib is able to bind a number of unrelated receptors.  
PF-05089326, metabolite M17, showed binding to a wide range of receptors.

Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential for palbociclib to cause neurofunctional effects was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats following 
administration of a single oral dose. Decreased exploratory behaviour during the open-field assessment was 
considered palbociclib-related at 300 mg/kg. Consistent with decreased exploratory behavior and hypoactivity, 
a decrease in activity (although not statistically significant) was observed at 300 mg/kg. Mean total distance and 
number of vertical movements were 19% and 18% less than controls, respectively. Palbociclib had no effect on 
neurofunction in rats at 30 or 300 mg/kg, but a decrease in locomotor activity was identified at 300 mg/kg. 
The potential effect of palbociclib on pulmonary function was assessed following administration of a single 
intravenous dose to anesthetized Beagle dogs. Two of 4 animals administered palbociclib at 5 mg/kg stopped 
breathing less than 2 minutes after initiation of drug infusion. Significant increases in minute volume and 
respiratory rate (0.6- to 4.6-times relative to the controls) were also observed at 4 to 8 minutes postdose and 
at 18 to 26 minutes postdose at 5 mg/kg. Altogether, a single IV dose of palbociclib in anesthetized dogs at 5 
mg/kg caused significant effects on pulmonary parameters, including increases in minute volume and 
respiratory rate, and decreases in compliance, peak expiratory flow, and tidal volume. The effects were 
transient, appeared related to peak-plasma concentrations of drug (≥2040 ng/mL; ≥843 ng/mL unbound, based 
on fu 0.413 in the dog, and were consistent with respiratory depression.  
The potential for palbociclib to cause cardiovascular effects following administration of a single dose was 
evaluated in conscious Beagle dogs. The data show that single doses of palbociclib were associated with QTc 
interval prolongation in dogs at ≥3 mg/kg where plasma concentrations were ≥162 ng/mL (67 ng/mL unbound 
based on fu of 0.413 in dogs, 4 times clinical Cmax[17 ng/mL]). Palbociclib also caused increases in QT interval, 
decreases in HR with a corresponding increase in RR interval, and a modest increase in systolic blood pressure 
at ≥10 mg/kg (mean Cmax at 10 mg/kg was 140 ng/mL unbound). 
The findings in telemetered dog were addressed in the clinic by ECG recordings performed during the Phase1/2 
study 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1010. A PK/PD analysis of the relationship between palbociclib exposure and ECG 
data was conducted using pooled data from Studies 1001, 1002, and 1003. A positive correlation was observed 
between QTc and palbociclib concentration. These data are further assessed in the clinical section. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacological interaction between palbociclib and anti-estrogen agents such as fulvestrant and letrozole has 
been described above. No additional pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted (see 
non-clinical discussion).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of palbociclib after oral or IV routes of administration were characterized in 
male S-D rats and Beagle dogs (toxicology species), and in male cynomolgus monkeys. Palbociclib was 
administered orally as the isethionate salt, while the dose was expressed as the free base equivalents. 
Table 8 - Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Palbociclib in Male Rats, Dogs, and Monkeys After Single IV or Oral 
Administration 
Distribution  
Radioequivalents were widely distributed into tissues and fluids, particularly in uvea, meninges, bile, harderian 
gland, preputial gland, liver, lacrimal gland, lung, thyroid, and spleen, with levels consistently greater than 
those observed in blood. These findings were consistent with the large Vss that exceeded total body water in 
rats.  
The extent of in vitro binding of palbociclib to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma proteins, human 
serum albumin (HSA), and α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was determined using equilibrium dialysis. Protein 
binding of palbociclib was moderate to low in the evaluated species, with the overall mean fraction unbound (fu) 
of 0.159, 0.125, 0.0733, 0.413, 0.147, 0.622, and 0.646 in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, human plasma, HSA, and 
AAG, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 24/140 
  
  
 
In vitro, blood-to-plasma ratios of palbociclib in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human were 1.13, 0.97, 1.0, 
1.04, and 1.63, respectively, indicating a modest preferential distribution of palbociclib to blood cells over 
plasma in human. In contrast, similar distribution of palbociclib between blood cells and plasma was observed in 
mouse, rat, dog, and monkey whole blood. 
Metabolism 
The major circulating metabolite for palbociclib in humans was M22, accounting for 14.8% of circulating 
radioactivity, this metabolite was not detected in rat or dog plasma. It was however detected after incubation 
with rat hepatocytes and in rat urine <2%. However, since M22 is a glucuronide conjugate of palbociclib it is of 
low toxicological concern. The other identified metabolites observed in human plasma (M11, M12, M16, M17, 
M24, M25, and M26), individually, showed an abundance ranging from 1.0% to 4.7%, which were less than 10% 
of circulating radioactivity and were considered as minor metabolites. In general, the human plasma recovery is 
poor with a large portion of radioactivity being uncounted for. This could be a potential concern, however the 
present indication falls under the S9 guide line and in such cases separate testing of metabolites is generally not 
warranted, especially if positive in embryo foetal toxicity testing (assessed below). However, if palbociclib is to 
be used in other indications, not falling under the S9 guide line, additional testing might be warranted.  
Excretion 
In rat, recovery of radioactivity was essentially complete (92.6% in males and 94.3% in females, respectively) 
by 168 hours after dosing, with 84% and 93.6% of the dose recovered in feces. The high fecal recovery was 
primarily via biliary excretion of the radioactivity, as evidenced by a recovery of 50.1% (male) and 81.3% 
(female) of dose in bile of BDC rats over 48 hours postdose. Feces recovery was similar in dog. In healthy 
humans, feces were also the major route of excretion accounting for 74.1% of the dose, with urine accounting 
for 17.5% of the dose. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The rat and dog were the selected rodent and non-rodent species, respectively, for general toxicity studies 
based on their suitable pharmacokinetic profiles and representation of the major metabolism pathways in 
humans. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single doses up to 500 mg/kg were tolerated in the rat. Body weight loss, foecal changes, hypoactivity, 
dyspnoea, and mortality were observed at ≥1000 mg/kg in the rat. In dog, emesis, decreased body weight and 
food consumption, foecal changes, and haematology changes (decreases in red blood cell [RBC] parameters, 
leukocytes, and platelets) that correlated with decreased bone marrow cellularity were observed in animals that 
received single doses of ≥30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Morbidity and mortality 
In rat mortality was observed at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day. The cause of the moribund condition was attributed to 
degeneration and/or inflammation in one or more of the feet; microscopic findings included myxomatous 
degeneration, vacuolated macrophage infiltrates, and neutrophilic inflammation. There was no 
palbociclib-related morbidity in the dog studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 25/140 
  
  
Non Clinical observations 
In rat, dose-depended at ≥50 mg/kg/day clinical signs of toxicity included chromodacryorrhoea, dyspnoea, 
hypoactivity, decreased skin turgor, pallor, rales, salivation, swelling of the forepaws and urogenital area, rough 
pelage, thin, red and urine staining, fecal staining small testes; swollen legs, abdomen, penis, or perioral area; 
lateral recumbence; nonformed faeces; clear or red oral discharge; pale eyes, feet, ears, or oral mucosa; cold 
skin (hind feet); discoloured (red) skin and haircoat, and foecal changes (absent, reduced, discoloured, and/or 
soft). The clinical signs were more pronounced in males. Body weights were decreased by 5% to 38% (relative 
to control) in males at ≥10 mg/kg/day body weights were only slightly decreased in females. Similar decreases 
were observed in food consumption. Clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption changes were reversible. 
Cataracts, consisting of anterior cortical, incomplete, or complete cataracts were identified from slit lamp 
biomicroscopy in male rats only at ≥30 mg/kg/day. 
In dog, emesis occurred periodically during the dosing period in males in all palbociclib-treated groups. A slight 
increase in the incidence of soft stools and red/swollen pinna(e) was noted at 2.0 mg/kg/day relative to controls. 
Slight decreases in body weight gain were also noted. Weight gain was reversible.  
Haematology 
Minimal to marked decreases included leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and/or lymphocytes), 
red blood cell parameters, and platelets, and were observed with dose-related severity in studies of ≥2 weeks 
duration in both rats and dogs. Also, increased corpuscular haemoglobin, corpuscular volume, red cell 
distribution and platelet count were observed. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow also showed decreased 
total nucleated cells in both myeloid and erythroid lineages. Not all parameters were fully reversible after 
recovery. 
Clinical chemistry 
At high-doses in rat (100 mg/kg/day, 15-week) and dog (≥3 mg/kg/day, 39-weeks) several parameters were 
effected including increased aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, albumin concentrations, A/G ratio, insulin values, glucose, urea nitrogen and 
aspartate.  
Histopathology 
Male reproductive organ effects included degeneration of seminiferous tubules, hypospermia and increased 
intratubular cellular debris of the epididymis, decreased secretion in seminal vesicles, and atrophy, decreased 
content, and/or degeneration/necrosis (moribund animal only) in the prostate. The effects on male reproductive 
organs were seen in the rat and/or dog (prostate and seminal vesicle changes in the rat only) with dose-related 
severity (minimal to severe) in studies of ≥3 weeks duration. These findings are regarded as only partly 
reversible.  
Hyperglycemia and glucosuria (up to +4 [≥1000 mg/dL]) correlated with pancreatic islet cell vacuolation and 
secondary effects in the kidney (tubule vacuolation) following 15 weeks of intermittent dosing in rats, and after 
27 weeks of intermittent dosing the effects on glucose homeostasis and the pancreas were associated with 
secondary effects in the eye (cataracts/lens degeneration), incisor teeth (ameloblast degeneration), kidney 
(tubule vacuolation), and adipose tissue (atrophy) of rats. The vacuolation in the pancreas was shown to be due 
to the loss of beta cells, and correlated with a decrease in serum insulin and C-peptide. These toxicities were 
observed at clinically relevant exposures and the damage related to glucose metabolism persisted after 
recovery.   
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 26/140 
  
  
Additional findings considered to be of less adverse nature included; gastrointestinal changes, cellular 
vacuolation in multiple tissues (liver, adrenal and respiratory), decreased mucous in glands of the glandular 
stomach (mild) and non-glandular stomach, phospholipidosis vacuolation (lung, lymphnode and bone marrow) 
and adrenal cortical cell hypertrophy.  
Genotoxicity 
The data shows that palbociclib caused micronuclei formation in an in vitro micronucleus assay in CHO-WBL cells 
that kinetochore analysis identified as due to an aneugenic mechanism. Also, significant increases in 
micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were observed in male rats at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day in a 
micronucleus assay.  
Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S9, carcinogenicity studies with palbociclib have not been conducted given the intended 
treatment of patients with advanced cancer.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Data from repeat-dose toxicity studies show macroscopic and microscopic impact on male reproductive organs, 
this was also observed in the dedicated male fertility study. However, the toxicity in the male reproductive 
organs did not influence mating and fertility of the treated males, ovarian and uterine parameters of the 
untreated females, or embryonic survival at any dose level. In the pivotal embryo-foetal developmental studies 
both maternal and foetal toxicity was observed in both species. Maternal toxicity generally consisted of 
decreased body weight gain and decreased food consumption. Thus, it can be concluded that sufficiently high 
doses were tested, as maternal toxicity was observed and the exposure in rat at the higher doses corresponds 
to 4 times the human exposure while, in rabbit, the exposure at the higher dose was 9 times the human 
exposure. In the offspring, in both species, skeletal variations were observed (increased foetal incidence of 
cervical ribs in rat and a low incidence of small phalanges on the forepaws in rabbit).  
Toxicokinetic data 
The NOAELs for palbociclib following 27 weeks of intermittent dosing were at <10 (males) and <50 (females) 
mg/kg/day in the rat and after 39 weeks of intermittent dosing in the dog were at <0.2 (males) and 3 (females) 
mg/kg/day. At these exposures the data show a very low exposure margin in animals in comparison to human 
(0.1-3 times clinical exposure).  
Local Tolerance  
In rabbit, palbociclib did not induce toxicity at the injection sites following in or perivascular administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
In 3T3 cells palbociclib is regarded as non-phototoxic and according to the present guidelines, additional in vivo 
phototoxicity testing is therefore not warranted.  
Haemolysis and Bone Marrow toxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016

Palbociclib did not induce haemolysis. Treatment of hBMNCs with palbociclib caused a concentration-dependent 
increase of cells in G1 phase, and decrease in S and G2/M phases, consistent with G1 cell cycle arrest, and was 
characterized by a fully reversible, concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation without apoptosis, cellular 
senescence, or DNA damage. The hBMNC response to palbociclib did not change when combined with 
fulvestrant.  
Impurities 
The applicant proposed specification limits for two impurities, PF-00710042 and PF-00447880, at 0.4% and 
0.5% respectively. In addition, the applicant has performed extended studies on PF-06694807, a degradant of 
palbociclib.  
In general, the lots used for the overall safety testing holds lower levels of the impurities than the levels 
suggested by the applicant (except for PF-00447880 used in bacterial mutagenicity testing). To extend the 
specification and since PF-00447880 exceed the 1 mg/day qualification threshold the applicant has performed 
additional genotoxicity studies. The data showed that PF-00447880 and PF-00710042 was negative for 
mutagenicity in bacterial revers mutation assay. In the case of PF-00447880 the data show that it causes 
micronuclei formation in the in vitro micronucleus assay performed in TK6 cells, which kinetochore analysis by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) identified as due to an aneugenic mechanism. PF-00447880 was present 
in the lot used for in vivo micronucleus assessment and the applicant concluded based of the NOAEL in that study 
(50 mg/kg/day) that PF-00447880 is safe to for use up to 0.47 mg/kg/day (0.5 mg/kg/day*0.94%).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology and toxicology programs were considered sufficient 
for the appropriate non-clinical assessment of palbociclib. No major objections for the safety evaluation have 
been identified; some other concerns regarding GLP were identified and solved during the assessment. 
In general the non-clinical program holds data/studies which are expected for an anti-cancer drug.  
The binding and inhibition data show that palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4 and CDK6 with a 50% 
inhibitory concentration of between 0.011 and 0.015 µM for CDK4/6 and their ligands. The data show that 
palbociclib increases the percentage of cell in G1 with increased exposure. However, in cell lines which lack a 
functional Rb no effect were observed.  
However, the data also show that Palbociclib has binding to a wider range of off-target kinases. The IC50 
concentration for such off-target binding is higher than clinical Cmax. However, biological consequences of 
binding below IC50 cannot be ruled out and thus some toxicity might be caused by off-target kinase binding. 
Palbociclib is a potent and selective reversible inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, the inhibition of which in turn inhibits 
the phosphorylation of the Rb protein, which results in G1-phase cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA 
synthesis. Expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1), which activates CDKs, in breast tumours correlates with ER-positive 
status. ER-positive breast cancer was therefore chosen for drug development. The combination of palbociclib 
with anti-hormonal agents in vitro in ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines indicated a synergistic effect on 
growth arrest accompanied by increased cell senescence. According to pre-clinical data, palbociclib lacks 
functional efficacy in Rb-negative cancer cell lines indicating the importance of intact Rb function for the efficacy 
of palbociclib. Alternative mechanisms of action and complementary pathways may be hypothesised, and 
confounding of preclinical experiments related to the immortalisation of cell lines that affect Rb-status has been 
suggested, but cannot be used to dismiss the actual preclinical findings. It is somewhat unclear in what way the 
dependence on functional Rb is covered by the intended indication. This matter was raised as clinical other 
concern and resulted in a preclinical post-authorisation commitment. The applicant committed to submit a 
preclinical study to address this uncertainty (see non-clinical conclusion). This is also further addressed in the 
Clinical Efficacy and benefit-risk sections. 
When combined with letrozole, palbociclib led to near-tumour stasis in a transplanted human tumour murine 
model. 
Secondary PD shows that palbociclib is able to bind a number of unrelated receptors. However, due to the low 
binding affinity against these receptors in relation to the steady state level in plasma it is unlikely that this 
binding contribute to the effect observed.  
PF-05089326, metabolite M17, showed binding to a wide range of receptors. However, considering the level of 
this metabolite in circulation, its protein binding and the intended indication, additional data on this binding was 
not considered necessary. 
The potential for palbociclib to cause cardiovascular effects following administration of a single dose was 
evaluated in conscious Beagle dogs. The data show that single doses of palbociclib were associated with QTc 
interval prolongation in dogs at ≥3 mg/kg where plasma concentrations were ≥162 ng/mL (67 ng/mL unbound 
based on fu of 0.413 in dogs, 4 times clinical Cmax[17 ng/mL]). The findings in telemetered dog were addressed 
in the clinic by ECG recordings performed during the Phase1/2 studies. 
The issue of QTcS increase and palbociclib treatment has been evaluated in non-clinical safety pharmacology 
studies and the signal has been addressed in four clinical studies. In addition, the signal has been added to the 
Assessment report

RMP and SmPC (section 5.2 and 5.3). From a non-clinical point of view additional studies or risk evaluation were 
not considered necessary at this time and future risk management is to be performed in the clinic. 
Consistent with the pharmacologic activity of palbociclib (cell cycle inhibition, CDK4/6 inhibition), the primary 
target organ findings included hematolymphopoietic and male reproductive organ effects in rats and dogs and 
altered glucose metabolism that was accompanied by effects on the pancreas and secondary changes in the eye, 
teeth, kidney, and adipose tissue (rats only). This information has been included in the SmPC in section 5.3.  
Gastrointestinal effects would be anticipated from a cell cycle inhibitor and while effects were observed in rats 
and dogs following single- and repeat-dose studies up to 3 weeks in duration (emesis, fecal changes, and 
microscopic changes in stomach and intestines), the effects were of limited severity at clinically relevant doses. 
Toxicokinetics data from the repeat-dose toxicity studies showed no or low exposure margins to the clinical 
exposure. Such low margins of exposure are not unexpected considering the mode-of-action of palbociclib.     
Palbociclib has genotoxic potential, which is not unexpected considering the mode of action.  A warning was 
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC stating that Ibrance is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. Also in section 5.3 it is stated that Ibrance may cause foetal harm 
if used during pregnancy. 
Data from embryofetal developmental studies show that palbociclib induces maternal toxicity and an increase in 
skeletal variations in the offspring. In the pivotal embryo-foetal developmental studies both maternal and foetal 
toxicity was observed in both species. Maternal toxicity generally consisted of decreased body weight gain and 
decreased food consumption. In the offspring, in both species, skeletal variations were observed (increased 
foetal incidence of cervical ribs in rat and a low incidence of small phalanges on the forepaws in rabbit). 
However, no malformations were observed and it is possible that the detected foetal variation is due to maternal 
toxicity rather than a direct toxic effect. In addition, considering the mode of action, the positive genotoxicity 
and the lack of placenta transfer data it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion as to the foetal toxicity induced by 
palbociclib. Nevertheless, the data available is accurately reflected in section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.   
However, no malformations were observed and it is possible that the detected foetal variation is due to maternal 
toxicity rather than a direct toxic effect. In addition, considering the mode of action, the positive genotoxicity 
and the lack of placenta transfer data it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion as to the foetal toxicity induced by 
palbociclib. The pharmacodynamic properties of palbociclib and the lack of foetal exposure data is reflected in 
section 5.3 and as a consequence the potential risk of reproductive and developmental toxicity needs to be kept 
in the RMP. 
The findings in male reproductive organs have been accounted for in SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 in which male 
patients are recommended to preserve sperm before initiation of treatment. 
The applicant proposed specification limits for two impurities, PF-00710042 and PF-00447880. Data showed 
that PF-00447880 causes micronuclei formation. PF-00447880 was present in the lot used for in vivo 
micronucleus assessment and the applicant concluded based of the NOAEL in that study (50 mg/kg/day) that 
PF-00447880 is safe to use up to 0.47 mg/kg/day (0.5 mg/kg/day0.94%). Based on the indication, dose and set 
specification limit it is agreed and accompanied risk for clastogenicity/carcinogenicity, is acceptable. However, 
this could potentially change if palbociclib is to be used in indications which do not fall under the S9 guide line. 
The data presented by the applicant so far show that palbociclib do not present an environmental risk following 
patient use. In addition, the applicant has agreed to rerun the OECD 308 study and to extend the analysis of 
palbociclib transformation, transformation products, half-life and potential persistence. This study is to be 
submitted no later than the 31st of January 2017.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted to support the non-clinical aspects of this application are considered acceptable. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP recommended the submission of a non-clinical study investigating the activity of 
palbociclib in vitro, and if possible in vivo, utilizing explants from human IHC Rb-positive and IHC Rb-negative 
fresh tumour samples by June 2019. 
In addition, the applicant committed to rerun the OECD 308 study and to extend the analysis of palbociclib 
transformation, transformation products, half-life and potential persistence. The CHMP recommended that the 
results are to be submitted no later than the 31st of January 2017.

Seven (7) biopharmaceutic studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers to assess absolute Bioavailability 
(BA) (Study 1015), relative BA and Bioequivalence (BE) (Studies 1009, 1020, 1022, 1036, and 1040), and food 
effect (Study 1021). In addition, 2 clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the antacid effect 
(Studies 1018 and 1038).

•  Bioavailability 
The absolute oral bioavailability (BA) of palbociclib from the 125-mg initial Phase 3 free base capsule was 46%. 
Based on CL, Cp/Cb ratio, fe and QH, the fraction absorbed is ca 70%. The rate and extent of palbociclib free 
base capsule dissolution is strongly pH dependent and decrease at higher pH (see section on drug interaction). 
The rate of absorption moderate with median Tmax in the range 6-8 hours after a single dose. Palbociclib is a 
substrate of the intestinal transporters MDR1 and BCRP in vitro. These transporters may affect the rate and 
extent of absorption of palbociclib.  
•  Bioequivalence 
The commercial formulation of palbociclib is an immediate-release free base capsule at three palbociclib dosage 
strengths of 75 mg, 100 mg, and 125 mg. When submitting this application, phase II data was available with an 
initial formulation, the isotretionate capsule. During the clinical development program, early clinical trials 
including Study 1003 (phase 1/2-study), the isethionate capsule was administered under “minimal fasting 
conditions” ie fasting 1 hour before to 2 hours after dosing. 
Another formulation, the “free base capsule formulation” has been used in the phase III study which was 
submitted during the assessment period (1023) and is administered under fed conditions. This formulation is 
intended for marketing.  
Administration with food was recommended in the Phase 3 studies submitted and this is reflected in the SmPC 
(see section 4.2). Bioequivalence has been established between the final Phase 3/commercial free base capsule 
given with food and the isethionate capsules given under fasting conditions supporting the bridge to Study 1003. 
Two (2) fasting conditions: an overnight fast and a “minimal fasting conditions” with 2 separate moderate-fat 
meals on each end represent the 2 extreme scenarios for compliant palbociclib dosing with regard to 
surrounding moderate meal intake in Study 1003 in which patients were instructed to fast from 1 hour before 
until 2 hours after palbociclib dosing. The bridge to the commercial formulation taken with food is considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 37/140 
  
  
 
well supported as BE was shown between these treatments. Equivalence was also shown between Final Phase 
3/commercial free base capsule formulation vs the isethionate capsule and the initial Phase 3 free base capsule 
under fasting conditions with respect to AUC, while Cmax was slightly lower for the isotretionate capsule. 
The effect of a high-fat, low-fat, and “minimal fasting conditions” surrounded by moderate-fat meals was 
investigated on the phase 3/commercial free base capsule formulation. There was a moderate increase in 
exposure which was considered to lack clinical relevance. However, there were three so called low-liers (see 
below) when the capsules were taken in fasting conditions. This was not the case during the studied fed 
conditions and the variability decreased accordingly. BE was shown versus administration after an overnight fast 
for the data subset excluding so called low-liers.  
The applicant submitted a special analysis on so called “low-liers” in the PK studies. The commercial/phase III 
free base capsule formulation was used in most of the clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutic studies. 13% 
of all PK profiles observed after palbociclib phase III free base capsule formulations under an overnight fasted 
condition were associated with substantially lower palbociclib exposure. These were called “low-liers”, which is 
defined as having a Cmax value less than or equal to 21.4 ng/mL or with a Cmax value that has a marginal 
studentized residual lower than –2 (based on DDI data with rabeprazol). It has been observed in clinical studies 
of palbociclib in healthy subjects that the low-lier incidence may or may not be consistent within an individual 
subject. The reason for low-lier occuring with the phase III free base formulation is thought to be the more 
sensitive pH-dependent dissolution profile of the free base capsules. Low-liers were not identified in studies 
conducted with palbociclib isothionate capsules or oral solution nor were they observed with phase III free base 
capsules administered with a high-fat or moderate-fat meal or in between meals (moderate-fat meal 1 hour 
before and 2 hours after dosing).

Figure 6 - Individual AUCs observed in phase I studies with “low-liers” marked in red. 
Distribution 
Following IV administration, palbociclib geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 1008 L. 
The fraction unbound in plasma, to HSA and the glucoprotein was 14%, 74%, and 63%. Other components, 
such as free fatty acids, may be contributing to the plasma binding. The protein binding of the palbociclib 
metabolite PF-05089326 was 0.05. For both substances, binding was not concentration-dependent. The human 
blood-to-plasma concentration ratio for palbociclib was 1.63. 
Elimination 
Palbociclib is mainly eliminated through metabolism. The major primary metabolic pathways were comprised of 
oxidation (14% of dose) and sulfonation (26% of dose), leading to metabolites M16 and M11, respectively. 
Metabolite M20 and metabolite 23 a/b were excreted in small amounts (5 and 4%, respectively). 
Glucuronidation and acylation appeared to be minor pathways. Palbociclib is not a substrate for OATP1B1 and 
1B3. 
Assessment report

Figure 7- Proposed metabolism schedule based on substances identified in faeces 
Only a small fraction of the dose was recovered as unchanged drug in faeces (2%) and urine (3.5 or 7%). Thus 
renal and biliary excretion appears of little importance for drug clearance. An extended sampling was needed for 
unchanged palbociclib in urine to reach 7%. This is not understood as the half-life (24 hrs) is sufficiently short 
for all palbociclib to be excreted within 120 hours.  
Itraconazole inhibits about half the elimination indicating that CYP3A4 is responsible for nearly half of the 
elimination of palbociclib. In addition, sulphate conjugates (SULT2A1 responsible for metabolism) is found in 
excreta contributing to 26% of the administrated dose (30-40% contribution to palbociclib elimination based on 
the fraction absorbed). Renal excretion has a minor contribution to palbociclib elimination. In conclusion, 
CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the main elimination pathways. 
Palbociclib contributed to one fifth of the radioactivity in plasma after a radiolabelled dose. Palbociclib Cmax was 
generally observed 6 hours after oral dosing, while Cmax of the metabolite PF-05089326 was observed earlier, 
around 4 hours after dosing. Median peak concentrations for total radioactivity in plasma were observed at 4 
hours after dosing (2 hours before palbociclib Cmax). 
Fifty-six % of the radioactivity in plasma over the first 120 hours was identified as palbociclib and metabolites. 
Unchanged palbociclib was the primary drug-related material accounting for 23% of the total plasma 
radioactivity. M22 (the glucuronide conjugate of palbociclib also found in urine) was the most abundant 
metabolite, at 14.8% of circulating radioactivity. The other primary clearance metabolites, M11, M26, and M12, 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 40/140 
  
  
 
 
were present in plasma at low levels (1.3%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively). M16, the major fecal metabolite, 
was present in plasma at 2.6%, whereas M20 was not detected. Three additional minor metabolites were 
identified as the lactam of palbociclib (M17, PF-05089326), a dilactam of palbociclib (M24), and a metabolite 
with the pyrido-piperazine substructure cleaved (M25), at 4.7%, 4.4%, and 2.3%, respectively. In addition, a 
number of metabolites have been identified, each with a less <2% contribution of the radioactivity up to 120 
hours. 
Metabolite M17 (PF-05089326) was shown to have comparable potency with that of palbociclib for inhibiting 
CDK 4 and CDK 6. However the exposure was too low for it to contribute to the in vivo activity. No “major 
metabolites” were identified in plasma contributing to >10% other than the glucuronide M22.  
Variability: Cmax and AUC(0-10) values demonstrated moderate inter-individual variability after single or multiple 
palbociclib dose administration. The %CVs for AUC(0-10) across all dose levels ranged from 5% to 55% on Day 1 
and 15% to 64% on Day 8. The %CV for Cmax ranged from 3% to 63% on Day 1 and 16% to 64% on Day 8 in 
the dose escalation study A5481001. Inter-individual variability in CL/F, estimated in the population PK analysis, 
was 36.7 %CV and for V/F 30 %CV.

were statistically significant. The analysis included PK information on palbociclib obtained in subjects included in 
study A5481001, A5481002 and A5481003.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Palbociclib exhibit dose-independent pharmacokinetics at single dose conditions. However as it is a TDI on 
CYP3A, it inhibits part of its own metabolism and thus, during multiple dose conditions, pharmacokinetics should 
be dose-dependent to some extent. 
The accumulation ratio is ca 2 and the terminal half-life is ca. 22 hours. Steady state is reached on day 8 in 
contrast to the day 3-5 that is expected based on the half-life. This is likely due to the weak time dependent 
CYP3A inhibitory property of palbociclib.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment: No formal study of the PK of palbociclib in renal impairment has been conducted. The effect 
of estimated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault) in the range of mild (39.6.8% of the patients CRCL ≥60 and 
<90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (15.7%, CRCL ≥60 and <90 mL/min) was evaluated in the PPK 
analysis.  
Hepatic impairment: Subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have been excluded from 
participation in clinical trials. 41 patients with mild hepatic impairment according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) scale were included in the studies. Baseline liver transaminase and bilirubin levels were evaluated as 
covariates in the PPK analysis and within the evaluated range of the liver function markers, no statistical 
significant effect was observed 
Weight, gender, race and age: The effect of weight, gender, race and age on the PK of palbociclib was evaluated 
in the population PK analysis.

Body weight (median 74 kg, range 38-123 kg) was identified as a significant covariate on CL/F and relative to 
the typical value of 60.2 L/h, CL/F was predicted to decrease by 13.2% at a weight of 55 kg (10th percentile) and 
to increase by 14.2% at a weight of 97 kg (90th percentile). Weight was also a significant covariate for V2/F. The 
quantified effects of bodyweight on exposure were not considered clinical relevant.  
Age (median 61, range 37-89) years was found to have a statistically significant effect on CL/F. At an age of 74 
years, CL/F was predicted to decrease by approximately 8 % compared to the value at 61 years, which was 
considered not being a clinical relevant effect 
A study conducted in healthy Japanese subjects showed that the mean AUCinf and Cmax values were 30% and 
35% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects (n= 14) when compared with demographic-matched non-Asian 
subjects (n=13) after 125-mg single dose. Furthermore, across studies in patients and following 125-mg 
multiple QD administration, the observed PK parameters at steady-state in Japanese patients (study 1010) 
indicated that palbociclib geometric mean AUC and C max are at least 43 and 60% respectively, higher than those 
observed in non-Asian patients who received the same 125-mg QD doses in separate studies 1001 (n=13) and 
1003 (n=12). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
IVIVC cut-offs: For DDI in vivo relevance assessment, the intestinal palbociclib concentration (0.1 x dose/250 
ml) is 112 uM. 50 x Cmax(u) is 1.9 uM. 
Enzyme inhibition: Palbociclib is a mild time dependent inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro (KI and kinact values of 10 μM, 
0.036 min-1 and 19 μM, 0.087 min-1 respectively) and this has been confirmed in vivo in a DDI study with 
midazolam where a 60% increase in AUC was observed. No inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 was observed in vitro. Unbound IC50 for UGT1A4, 1A9 and 2B7 is 58, 13, and 37 
uM, respectively and UGT1A1 and 1A6 were not inhibited. 
Transporter inhibition: Palbociclib IC50 for Pgp was 9.9 µM using digoxin and 3.8 µM using talinolol as substrate. 
For BCRP, the IC50 of palbociclib was 11.6 µM using digoxin and 4.2 µM using talinolol. It may not be excluded 
that palbociclib inhibits BCRP and Pgp in the intestine. Systemic inhibition (liver, kidney) is not expected. 
Palbociclib does not inhibit BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2. 
Increased gastric pH: Rabeprazole gave rise to a marked (61%) reduction in palbociclib exposure during fasting 
conditions due to the pH dependent solubility of palbociclib. However under fed conditions (moderate-fat meal), 
the effect was only a 13% decrease and therefore not clinically relevant. Famotidine had no effect on the 
exposure of palbociclib. Antacids 2 hours before palbociclib did not have any effect on palbociclib exposure.  
CYP3A inhibition: Itraconazole 200 mg qd gave rise to an 87% increase in palbociclib exposure, showing the 
importance of CYP3A (Pgp) in palbociclib elimination. 
Enzyme induction: Rifampicin for 7 days gave rise to a 85% reduction of palbociclib exposure. The moderate 
inducer modafinil gave a 32% reduction in exposure. 
Potential to inhibit CYP3A: Palbociclib 125 mg qd for 7 days increased the exposure of midazolam by 61%. The 
steady state is probably a bit higher but the classification will still be a mild inhibitor.  
Antiestrogens: There was no effect of tamoxifen on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib. There was no 
interaction between letrozole and palbociclib. Based on trough levels, fulvestrant does not affect the palbociclib 
pharmacokinetics.

Regarding the risk for interactions between aromatase inhibitors/LHRH agonists and palbociclib 
Palbociclib effect on anastrozole: Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A and it has been 
suggested that CYP3A4 is involved in the elimination of anastrozole. This may lead to a theoretical interaction 
risk between palbociclib and anastrozole. However, given the weak nature of palbociclib as a CYP3A inhibitor 
(61% exposure increase of midazolam) and the fact that anastrozole has multiple elimination pathways the risk 
for a clinically relevant drug interaction of palbociclib on anastrozole is considered unlikely. 
Anastrozole effect on palbociclib: Palbociclib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Anastrozole is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A 
with a Ki of 10 µM (Grimm and Dyroff, 1997). The steady state Cmax of anastrozole is 0.3 µM and its plasma 
protein binding is 40%. Consequently, the 50×Cmax(u) of anastrozole is 6 µM and lower than the anastrozole 
CYP3A Ki. In addition, multiple 1 mg doses of anastrozole did not show any effect on the CYP3A4 substrate 
tamoxifen steady-state through concentrations in a study by The ATAC Trialists’ Group, 2001. These data clearly 
shows that anastrozole is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP3A and therefore the risk of a clinically 
relevant interaction of anastrozole on palbociclib is considered low.  
In addition, currently ongoing clinical studies include palbociclib and anastrozole co-administration and may 
inform further on a possible interaction. 
Palbociclib effect on exemestane: Exemestane are metabolised by CYP3A4 and aldoketoreductase. According to 
the product information of exemestane, ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not affect the PK of 
exemestane. In contrast, rifampicin (a potent CYP3A inducer) reduced the exposure of exemestane by 54%. 
These data suggests that metabolism via CYP3A4 is a minor elimination pathway for exemestane and that the 
weak CYP3A4 inhibitor palbociclib would most probably not affect the PK of exemestane. 
Exemestane on palbociclib: Palbociclib is metabolised by CYP3A4. Exemestane at steady-state did not affect the 
exposure of tamoxifen (a CYP3A4 substrate) according to an in vivo study by Hutson 200514. Thus, it may be 
concluded that exemestane are not likely to affect the PK of palbociclib. 
In addition, currently ongoing clinical studies include palbociclib and exemestane coadministration and may 
inform further on a possible interaction. 
The effect of palbociclib on LHRH agonists: LHRH agonists are unlikely to be metabolised by microsomal 
enzymes in the liver but rather by hydrolytic cleavage and peptidases. Therefore, no interactions of palbociclib 
on LHRH agonists are awaited.  
The effect of LHRH agonists on palbociclib: No clinically relevant DDI between palbociclib and goserelin when the 
two agents were dosed concurrently. For the other LHRH agonists no indications of an interaction potential at 
CYP enzymes were found neither in its product information nor in the literature. This together with the relatively 
limited effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole on palbociclib exposure (87% increase) supports that 
the risk for an effect of LHRH agonists on palbociclib PK is low. 
The risk for clinically relevant drug interactions between palbociclib and anastrozole/exemestane is considered 
low.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not submit studies on the mechanism of action. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Based upon the observation that the expression of the downstream target of palbociclib, CCND1, in breast 
tumour isolates correlates with ER-positive status, palbociclib was tested in vitro on molecularly characterized 
human breast cancer cell lines. Results from these experiments indicated that cell lines that were more sensitive 
to palbociclib (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] <150 nM) had low levels of the CDK inhibitor 2A 
(CDKN2A; also known as ‘p16INK4A’), and high levels of the retinoblastoma (RB) 1 gene, while resistant cell 
lines show the opposite characteristics. Sensitive cell lines in this panel represented mostly the luminal 
ER-positive subtype.  
The combination of palbociclib with tamoxifen has also been tested in vitro in ER-positive (ER+) human breast 
cancer cell lines indicating a synergistic interaction, and recently, the combination of palbociclib with letrozole 
has also shown a synergistic effect. 
Exposure-response/safety 
Exposure-response analyses of palbociclib exposure on progression free survival (PFS) were conducted using 
data obtained from study 1003. The analyses indicate a trend for better PFS with increasing exposure. However, 
due to limited data (n=81) with a fixed dose of 125 mg in study 1003, a quantification of the relationship could 
not be obtained with high confidence.  
PK-safety response relationship for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia relationships were characterized by a 
semi-mechanistic population longitudinal PK/PD model. A larger exposure was associated with a larger reduction 
in absolute neutrophil count and absolute thrombocyte count.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the bioanalysis methods used were well described and both pre-study and within-study validation 
was acceptable.  
The bridging between formulations and associated food recommendations is considered well supported. 13% of 
all PK profiles obtained with the phase II/commercial free base tablet in fasting conditions were identified as 
“low-liers”. Low-liers were not identified in fed conditions (high-fat or moderate-fat meal or in between meals 
(moderate-fat meal 1 hour before and 2 hours after dosing). This, together with the fact that palbociclib was 
dosed with food in phase III, palbociclib should be taken with food, preferably a meal (see SmPC sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Palbociclib is mainly eliminated through metabolism. Only a small fraction of the dose was recovered as 
unchanged drug in faeces (2%) and urine (3.5 or 7%).Renal and biliary excretion of palbociclib appears of 
limited importance for drug clearance. CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes responsible for the majority of 
elimination of palbociclib. 
Palbociclib exhibit dose-independent pharmacokinetics at single dose conditions. However as it is a TDI on 
CYP3A4, it inhibits part of its own metabolism and thus, during multiple dose conditions, pharmacokinetics 
should be dose-dependent to some extent. Steady state is reached on day 8 in contrast to the day 3-5 that is 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 44/140 
  
  
expected based on the half-life. This is likely due to the weak time dependent CYP3A inhibitory property of 
palbociclib. Inter-individual variability in CL/F is moderate. 
Palbociclib contributed to one fifth of the radioactivity in plasma after a radiolabelled dose. Palbociclib Cmax was 
generally observed 6 hours after oral dosing, while Cmax of the metabolite PF-05089326 was observed earlier, 
around 4 hours after dosing. Median peak concentrations for total radioactivity in plasma were observed at 4 
hours after dosing (2 hours before palbociclib Cmax) but this could not be explained by the metabolite 
PF-05089326 due to too low exposure. The higher exposure for radioactivity may be due to the presence of 
metabolite(s) with high exposure in plasma. In line with this, the mean t½ for total radioactivity (77 hours) was 
more than 3-fold longer than that for palbociclib or PF-05089326 (~21 hours). 
No formal study of the PK of palbociclib in renal impairment has been submitted. The effect of mild and moderate 
renal impairment was evaluated in the PPK analysis. Since renal elimination appears to be a minor route of 
elimination for palbociclib, no initial dose adjustment is needed in subjects with mild and moderate renal 
impairment.  No data is available in severe renal impairment or ESRD which is acceptable (see SmPC sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). A study (1014) in renal impairment is ongoing and planned to be submitted in June 2017.  
There is an ongoing study in hepatic impairment which should be submitted as a post-approval commitment. 
Mild hepatic impairment was evaluated with PPK and no initial dose adjustment is needed in mild hepatic 
impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). A study (1013) in hepatic impairment is ongoing and planned 
to be submitted in December 2017. 
The applicant has not discussed whether the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib can be subject to genetic 
differences. CYP3A has some genetic component. SULT2A1 is subject to copy number polymorphism expressed. 
However, due to the apparent multiple pathways, CHMP decided to not pursue this issue further.  
Weight, gender, race and age were considered having no clinically relevant effect on palbociclib exposure. 
No statistically significant effects of gender (72.2 % female) on the PK parameters as found. Considering the 
intended patient population (women with breast cancer) the conclusion is of less importance.  
No initial dose adjustment in elderly was proposed which considered the available data was considered 
acceptable. 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib paediatric patients, which is 
acceptable since a class waiver for paediatric patients < 18 years of age apply. 
.Inhibition in vivo at a “systemic level” is unlikely. Inhibition in the intestine of UGT1A4, 1A9 and 2B7 cannot be 
excluded but is considered of negligible clinical relevance.  
The proposed Ibrance indication is treatment in combination with aromatase inhibitors and LHRH agonists. Thus, 
the risk for interactions between palbociclib and aromatase inhibitors and LHRH agonists was assessed and 
shown to be low. Consequently, the combination of palbociclib and aromatase inhibitors/LHRH agonists is 
considered acceptable from a pharmacokinetic perspective. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of palbociclib has in general been well characterised and considered acceptable to 
support this application.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two dose-response studies were mentioned, Study 1001 and Study 1010. Only the former was completed and 
available for assessment.  
Study 1001 – Dose finding 
A Phase 1 Clinical, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of 2 Schedules of Oral PD 0332991, a 
Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor, in Patients With Advanced Cancer 
Study 1001 evaluated 2 different dosing schedules of palbociclib in patients with advanced cancer: a 4-week 
schedule consisting of 21 days of treatment followed by 7 days without treatment (Schedule 3/1) and a 3-week 
schedule consisting of 14 days of treatment followed by 7 days without treatment (Schedule 2/1). The 
palbociclib treatment schedules were selected based in part on (1) anticipated toxicities and (2) plans to test 
palbociclib both as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The predicted toxicity of 
reversible myelosuppression observed non-clinically in rats and dogs prompted the inclusion in each schedule of 
a 1-week treatment interruption in each cycle to allow recovery of haematologic parameters. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose level studied for which the incidence of 
first-cycle DLT was less than 33%, i.e. as commonly done with cytotoxic compounds.  
The recommended Phase 2 doses, and MTDs, were determined to be 125 mg QD on Schedule 3/1 and 200 mg 
on Schedule 2/1. (Figure 8)

Figure 8 - Study 1001 - Dose Escalation and Schedule Summary 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
DLTs were defined as: Grade 4 haematologic toxicity, Grade 3 neutropenia associated with a documented 
infection or fever ≥38.5°C, Grade≥ 3 non-haematologic treatment-related toxicity, except those that had not 
been maximally treated (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) or that the patient considered tolerable (such as 
skin rash), inability to receive the next dose of palbociclib within 1 week (±1 day) of the last dose due to lack of 
haematologic recovery (platelets <50,000/μL, ANC <1,000/μL, and haemoglobin <8.0 g/dL) or due to 
prolonged non-haematologic toxicities of ≥Grade 3 severity.

Table 11 - Summary of Safety Outcomes Used to Determine Dose Escalation and MTD (Study 1001, Full Analysis 
Set Population) 
All observed DLTs were haematological, mostly neutropenia. The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in Cycle 
1 compared with subsequent treatment cycles (93% vs 77%) and consistently lower frequencies were seen for 
almost all SOCs, with the main exception of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders which did not reach 
the 5% frequency cut-off in Cycle 1, but occurred in 27% (4% related) of patients across regimens and doses in 
subsequent cycles.  
Efficacy 
One patient (who had testicular cancer and was on the 14/21 day dosing schedule) had a confirmed partial 
response (PR) during the study. Thirty-five percent of patients on the 21/28 day schedule and 29% of patients 
on the 14/21 day schedule had stable disease (SD) for two or more cycles of treatment; 27% of patients on the 
21/28 day schedule and 19% of patients on the 14/21 day schedule had SD for 4 or more cycles; and 16% of 
patients on the 21/28 day schedule and 10% of patients on the 14/21 day schedule had SD for 10 or more 
cycles. 
The conclusion was that the safety profiles of Schedule 2/1 and Schedule 3/1 were generally comparable; 
however, a greater proportion of patients on Schedule 2/1 had treatment-related adverse events than on 
Schedule 3/1. The safety profiles, along with the suggestion of greater long-term anti-tumour activity observed 
on Schedule 3/1, led to the selection of this treatment schedule for the advanced breast cancer study. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Phase 1/2 study 1003 (PALOMA-1) was initially submitted as the pivotal study, but in view of issues 
identified in this study, and with the submission during review of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) 
of data from 2 phase 3 studies, Study 1003 was no longer considered pivotal for the marketing application. As 
such, it is discussed in the section for Supportive studies below.  
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3)  
Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial of fulvestrant (Faslodex) 
with or without PD-0332991 (palbociclib) ± goserelin in women with hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy. 
This study was submitted in order to support the indication for palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant.

pathological or physiological cause; and serum estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females; 
o  Documented bilateral oophorectomy; 
o  Medically confirmed ovarian failure 
or 
Pre/ perimenopausal, ie, not meeting the criteria for being postmenopausal. 
o  Pre/perimenopausal women could have been enrolled if amenable to be treated with the LHRH agonist 
goserelin. Patients were to have commenced treatment with goserelin or an alternative LHRH agonist at

tumour biopsy (unless bone-only disease, see below) utilizing an assay consistent with local standards. 
4. Documented HER2-negative tumour based on local testing on most recent tumour biopsy: 
HER2-negative tumour was determined as immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ 
hybridization (FISH [fluorescent in situ hybridization]/CISH [chromogenic in situ hybridization]/SISH [silver 
fluorescent in situ hybridization]/DISH [dual fluorescent in situ hybridization]) defined as a human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2/centromeric probe for chromosome 17 (HER2/CEP17) ratio <2 or for single probe 
assessment a HER2 copy number <4. 
5. Patients were to satisfy the following criteria for prior therapy: 
o  Progressed during treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant therapy with an aromatase 
inhibitor if postmenopausal, or tamoxifen if pre- or perimenopausal. 
or

o  One previous line of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease was allowed in addition to 
endocrine therapy. 
6. Except where prohibited by local regulations, all patients were to agree to provide and had available a 
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsy sample taken at the time of presentation with recurrent

recurrent/metastatic disease was available. The sole exceptions were those patients with bone-only disease for 
whom provision of previous archival tissue only was acceptable. Patients who had surgery within the last 3 years 
(but without neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery) and relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy may 
provide a tumour specimen from that surgery.

metastatic cancer were to have a lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesion that could be accurately assessed by 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with bone-only disease and 
blastic-only metastasis were not eligible. Tumour lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy were only deemed measurable if progression at the treated site after completion of 
therapy was clearly documented.

Treatments 
Arm A: palbociclib 125 mg administered orally once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for each 
28-day cycle (Schedule 3/1) plus fulvestrant (Faslodex) 500 mg intramuscularly on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, 
and every 28 days (+/-7 days) thereafter starting from Day 1 of Cycle 1. 
Arm B: placebo administered orally once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for each 28-day cycle 
(Schedule 3/1) plus fulvestrant (Faslodex) 500 mg intramuscularly on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and every 28 
days (+/-7 days) thereafter starting from Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
Palbociclib doses could be reduced to 100 mg daily and 75 mg daily on 3/1 schedule, respectively, or to 75 mg 
on a 2-week on/2-week off (2/2) schedule. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as determined by the investigators’ assessment. The secondary 
endpoints included an assessment of secondary measures of efficacy and the safety and tolerability of 
palbociclib administered in combination with fulvestrant as well as of placebo plus fulvestrant.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, objective response, duration of response, clinical benefit response, 
and patient reported outcomes (PROs).  
Primary objective: 
To demonstrate the superiority of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) over 
fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) plus placebo in prolonging investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival (PFS) in women with hormonal receptor positive (HR-positive)/human epidermal growth factor negative 
(HER2-negative) metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. 
Secondary objectives: 
• To compare measures of tumour control, including objective response (OR), duration of response (DR), clinical 
benefit response (CBR = CR or PR or stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks) and overall survival (OS) between the 
treatment arms.  
• To compare safety and tolerability between the treatment arms. 
• To evaluate trough concentrations of palbociclib when given in combination with fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus 
goserelin compared to historical palbociclib data. 
• PK: To compare fulvestrant and goserelin trough concentrations when given in combination with palbociclib to 
those when given without palbociclib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 52/140 
  
  
• PK: To explore correlations between palbociclib exposures and efficacy/safety findings in this patient 
population. 
• To compare Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) measures between treatment arms. PRO endpoints such as 
global Quality of Life (QOL), functioning, breast symptoms, time to deterioration (TTD) in pain, EQ-5D index and 
general health status. 
• To characterize alterations in genes, proteins, and ribonucleic acids (RNAs) relevant to the cell cycle, drug 
targets, tumour sensitivity and/or resistance.  
• To conduct subgroup analysis for primary and secondary endpoints in stratified groups. 
Tumour assessments 
Post-baseline tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) for the first year, then after 1 year 
every 12 weeks (±7 days) (calculated from randomization) until radiographically and/or clinically (i.e., for 
photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, study treatment discontinuation, 
initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (e.g., death, 
patient's request, lost to follow-up) 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was determined based on the results of a randomized Phase 2 trial assessing 
fulvestrant with or without dasatinib in postmenopausal patients with HR positive metastatic breast cancer 
previously treated with an AI. The median PFS for the fulvestrant alone arm was 5.3 months and the median PFS 
for the combination arm was 6.0 months. Based upon these results, the median PFS for the comparator arm in 
this study was assumed to be 6.0 months. 
An improvement of 56% to a median PFS of 9.38 months (corresponding to a HR=0.64) was to be considered 
clinically meaningful. A total of 238 PFS events were required in the two treatment arms for the study to have 
a 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 (representing a 56% improvement in median PFS [6.00 months vs 
9.38 months]) with a 1-sided significance level of alpha=0.025. 
Assuming a non-uniform accrual accomplished over a period of about 14 months, data follow-up for 
approximately 20 months from the start of study randomization for final PFS analysis, and a non-uniform 
dropout with dropout rate of 25% at 18 months for PFS, a total sample size of approximately 417 patients (278 
in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and 139 in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm) was required. 
The sample size described above also allowed the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of OS. 
The median OS for women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with AI and fulvestrant 
monotherapy was assumed to be 24 months. With an overall one-sided α of 0.025 and one interim analysis of 
OS, the study had approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.65 (representing a 54% increase in median OS 
from 24 months to37 months) when 198 deaths had occurred.  
A sample-size re-estimation was allowed by protocol at the interim analysis (see below), using the inferential 
procedure described by Cui et al (1999)15 to preserve the type I error.

Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (Yes versus No), by 
menopausal status at study entry (pre-/peri- versus postmenopausal), and by the presence of visceral 
metastases (Yes versus No). ‘Visceral’ referred to lung, liver, brain, pleural and peritoneal involvement. 
Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either: documented clinical benefit (CR, PR, SD 
2 4  
weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting, or at least 24 months of adjuvant 
hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. 
Statistical methods 
PFS data were censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for patients who did not have 
objective tumor progression and who did not die while on study. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor 
response after randomization had their PFS time censored on the date of randomization with the duration of one 
day. Additionally, patients who started a new anticancer therapy prior to documented PD were censored at the 
date of the last tumor assessment prior to the start of the new therapy. Patients with documentation of PD or 
death after an unacceptably long interval (ie, 2 or more incomplete or non-evaluable assessments) since the last 
tumor assessment were censored at the time of last objective assessment that did not show PD. 
Time-to-event endpoints between the 2 treatment arms will be compared with a 1-sided stratified log-rank test 
adjusting for presence of visceral metastases and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (two of the baseline 
stratification factors). PFS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized for the ITT population 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate. Hazard ratios and 2-sided 95% 
confidence intervals (subject to the multiplicity adjustment at the final analysis for PFS and OS) will be estimated 
using Cox proportional hazards regression. 
Cox proportional hazard models will also be used to explore the potential influences of the baseline stratification 
factors on time-to-event endpoints. 
The study is designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis at 238 events based on the primary PFS 
endpoint with the investigator assessment. The interim analysis will be conducted to allow for early stopping of 
the study due to efficacy or to potentially re-estimate the sample size of the trial based upon the primary 
endpoint of PFS. The safety of the combination will also be assessed at the interim analysis. The Haybittle-Peto 
boundary will be used (alpha=0.00135 was to be spent at interim analysis) in developing the efficacy boundary 
of the interim analysis of PFS. The analysis will be performed after approximately 143 investigator-assessed PFS 
events (documented progressive disease or death; approximately 60% of the total events expected). The 
information fraction for the interim analysis may be adjusted if needed. 
Only one interim analysis of OS is planned. Although the first possible time for OS interim analysis could be at 
the time of the PFS IA, it is anticipated that the number of deaths could be low at PFS IA and yield non-robust 
analysis results. Therefore, the OS interim analysis will be planned at approximately 97 deaths (at the estimated 
time for planned PFS final analysis). For the interim analysis of OS, O’Brien-Fleming boundary will be used and 
the overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of OS will be preserved at 0.025 (one-sided test).

Table 12 - Patient’s Disposition (Study 1023) 
Recruitment 
Between 26 Sept 2013 and 26 Aug 2014, a total of 521 pre- /peri- and postmenopausal women were 
randomized (2:1) to the study at 144 sites in 17 countries: Australia (11 sites), Belgium (11 sites), Canada (11 
sites), Germany (2 sites), Ireland (1 site), Italy (9 sites), Japan (8 sites), the Netherlands (6 sites), Portugal (2 
sites), Romania (4 sites), the Russian Federation (5 sites), the Republic of South Korea (5 sites), Taiwan (2 
sites), Turkey (1 sites), the Ukraine (6 sites), the United Kingdom (4 sites), and the United States (56 sites). 
Three hundred forty-seven (347) patients were randomized to the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm, and 174 
patients were randomized to the placebo plus fulvestrant arm, of which 99 pre- /perimenopausal patients 
additionally received goserelin across both treatment arms.

Conduct of the study 
The frequencies of different types of protocol deviations were similar across study arms. The majority of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria violations in both arms pertained to exclusion criteria 5, which states that all 
anti-cancer treatments should have been stopped at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Secondly, violations 
with regard to providing tumour samples for central lab analysis were frequent.  
There were 2 protocol amendments and 1 SAP amendment during study. 
The protocol was amended to revise the study drug administration instructions from administration in a fasted 
state to administration with food and to prohibit the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors. Prospective 
ophthalmic examinations, and prospective monitoring of haemoglobin A1c were added to characterize whether 
or not palbociclib affected glucose metabolism. SAP amendments included eg changes due to that biomarker 
analyses were not performed.

Numbers analysed 
All efficacy analyses were based on intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Some efficacy sensitivity analyses were also 
performed on AT populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 60/140 
  
  
 
  
 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population or full analysis set will include all patients who are randomized, with study 
drug assignment designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether patients receive study 
drug or receive a different drug from that to which they were randomized. The ITT population will be the primary 
population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient characteristics.  
The as-treated (AT) population or safety analysis set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study 
medication, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received. The AT 
population will be the primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety. 
Efficacy and clinical benefit endpoints may be assessed in this population as well.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint –Progression-free survival 
The study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis; the results 
crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant 
prolongation in PFS and a clinical meaningful treatment effect. The observed HR was 0.422 (95% CI: 0.318, 
0.560; stratified 1-sided p-value <0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. The median PFS was 9.2 
months (95% CI: 7.5, not estimable) for 347 patients randomized to palbociclib plus fulvestrant and 3.8 months 
(95% CI: 3.5, 5.5) for 174 patients randomized to placebo plus fulvestrant. 
At the primary data cutoff date, the most common type of PFS event was disease progression, for 100 (28.8%) 
patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 91 (52.3%) patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. Two 
deaths were reported in each treatment arm. 
A total of 245 (70.6%) patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 81 (46.6%) in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm were censored in the investigator-assessed PFS analysis. The majority of censored patients 
were still in follow-up for disease progression at the time of censoring, 227 (65.4%) patients in the palbociclib 
plus fulvestrant arm and 70 (40.2%) patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. 
Two efficacy updates have subsequently been submitted; see further below.

Cooperative Oncology Group, HR: hazard ratio, IND: indeterminate, ITT: intent-to-treat, vs: versus, PD: progressive disease, PFS: 
progression-free survival. 
Sensitivity analysis 1: Influence of analysis population; based on AT population 
Sensitivity analysis 2: A 1-sided unstratified log-rank test was used to compare treatments and the HR was based on an unstratified Cox 
proportional hazards model. 
Sensitivity analysis 3: To investigate whether the stratification factors and important covariates influenced the outcome of the primary endpoint 
PFS. Final explanatory variables for the multivariate model were selected using a backward selection process with the significance level of 0.1 
for retaining the effects in the model. Baseline factors that entered the model selection included age (≥65 vs <65), race (White, Black, Asian, 
Other), baseline ECOG status (1 vs 0), disease site (Non-Visceral vs Visceral), sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (Yes vs No), menopausal 
status at study entry (Pre/Peri vs Post), ethnic origin (Hispanic vs Not-Hispanic), and geographical region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific). 
Assessor’s note: Baseline ECOG status (1 vs. 0), and disease site (non-visceral vs. visceral) met the criteria and were the two baseline factors 
included in the model to yield the HR 0.395. 
Sensitivity analysis 4: Influence of disease assessment scheduling. If disease progression was documented between 2 scheduled tumour 
assessments, then the date of progression was assigned to the earlier scheduled tumour assessment. In the event of death, the date of the 
endpoint was not adjusted. 
Sensitivity analysis 5: Influence of deviations in tumour lesion assessment. If a lesion was classified as “indeterminate” (IND) at time point “X” 
and was adequately evaluated as PD at the next time point “X+1”, then PD was assigned to the time point “X” or earlier (the first date of the 
consecutive INDs) instead of the date of the next time point “X+1” as the primary analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.1: Influence of bone-only disease patients. Patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, surgery, 
ECOG at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were censored at the date of prior tumour assessment with no PD. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.2: Influence of bone-only disease patients: Patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, surgery, 
ECOG at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were considered as events. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.3: Influence of bone-only disease patients: Bone-only disease patients were excluded from the analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis 7: Influence of Missing Data: The following missing PFS data that might have resulted in the censored PFS data in the 
primary analysis were considered PFS events in addition to the documented PD and death: new anti-cancer treatment, lost to follow-up, consent 
withdrawal, medication error without associated AE. 
Sensitivity analysis 8: Influence of potential investigator bias. Random sample BICR data and investigator assessed PFS (event) data were 
combined. For events identified by both BICR and investigator, BICR data were used to determine event time. For patients who were censored 
by both BICR and investigator, BICR (when applicable) data were used to determine the censoring time. 
1) For sensitivity analyses 1 and 4 to 8, stratified hazard ratios are presented, for sensitivity analyses 2 and 3 unstratified hazard ratio ratios. 
2) 1-sided p-values are reported except for sensitivity analysis 3 (2-sided p-value)

PFS updates 
16 March 2015 
An updated analysis of the PFS endpoint was performed after 259 patients had documented PD or death based 
on investigator assessment. The median duration of follow-up across the trial as of the 16 March 2015 data 
cutoff was 8.9 months. No data from blinded independent review were provided in the efficacy updates. 
At an overall event rate of 50% (42 vs. 65%) the PFS HR was 0.46 (0.36-0-59), slightly higher but in line with 
the results in the interim analysis. Median PFS was 9.5 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a difference of 4.9 months. 
23 October 2015 
A later update with data cut-off date 23 Oct 2015 was subsequently submitted based on an overall event rate of 
64% (333 events in 521 patients) and a median follow-up of over 15 months in both arms. Again the PFS HR is 
slightly higher, at 0.497, but in line with the results in the interim analysis.  
In the second update, the difference between arms in median PFS has increased to 6.6 months (11.2 vs 4.6 
months, respectively). A summary is given in table 19, details in table 20 and figure 10.

Overall survival  
At the 05 December 2014 data cut-off date for the primary PFS analysis, there were 28 deaths from 521 
patients, 19 (5.5%) patients had died in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 9 (5.2%) patients had died in 
the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. The median 
follow-up time was 5.6 months for both treatments arms. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier plot of OS is 
presented in figure 11.

At the data cut-off date of 16 March 2015 for the updated analysis, there were an additional 29 deaths resulting 
in a total of 57 deaths, 36 in the palbociclib arm and 21 in the control arm.  
A pre-specified Interim OS Analysis was undertaken with a data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015.  At this time, there 
were a total of 112 death events [71 (20.5%) vs 41(23.6%) on the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and placebo 
plus fulvestrant arm, respectively, representing 21.5% of the 521 total patients. The detailed summary of the 
deaths as of the data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015 are presented in Table 21.

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The PRO evaluable population was defined as a subset of ITT patients, who had completed a baseline and at least 
one post–baseline PRO assessment prior to end of study treatment. No update was provided for PROs.  
Patient–reported outcomes were investigated using the instruments, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQC30 and EQ-5D. 
These are considered standard. However, no primary objective and no strategy to protect the type-1 error 
rational are put forward in the study protocol or SAP. Furthermore, the results indicated emotional functioning 
as a driver for the overall health related QoL, why the plausibility of results may also be questioned. Unblinding 
due to the effects of palbociclib on the bone marrow may clearly be present and the results potentially associated 
with hopes with regard to the benefit of the experimental compound. The claims concerning Global Health 
Status/QoL were therefore not accepted. 
Time to Deterioration in Pain 
A time to event analysis was prespecified for pain. Time to Deterioration (TTD) in pain was defined as time from 
baseline to first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in pain on study. This is an established cut-off in 
QLQ-C30.

HER2-overexpression by IHC (defined as IHC3+, or IHC2+ with FISH or CISH confirmation) based on local 
laboratory results utilizing one of the sponsor-approved assays (see Appendix 2). If HER2 status is unavailable 
or was determined using a test other than a sponsor-approved assay, then testing must be performed/repeated 
using one of these assays prior to randomization. If tissue sample from both primary and recurrent/metastatic 
tumours are available, HER2 assessment from the most recent sample (i.e., recurrent/metastatic sample) 
should be used to define eligibility whenever feasible.

Treatments 
Patients received palbociclib 125 mg once daily (QD) or placebo QD orally for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off 
treatment and letrozole 2.5 mg QD orally continuously. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary objectives include the comparison of OS, 
objective response, duration of response, disease control, biomarkers, health-related quality of life, and the 
safety and tolerability between the treatment arms. 
Primary objective: 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate if palbociclib in combination with letrozole would be superior 
to placebo plus letrozole in prolonging investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in postmenopausal 
women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received any prior systemic 
anticancer therapies for their advanced/metastatic disease. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare measures of tumour control duration and overall survival between the treatment arms; 
To compare safety and tolerability between the treatment arms; 
To compare health related quality of life between the treatment arms; 
To characterize the effects of palbociclib at therapeutic doses in combination with letrozole on QTc 
interval in this patient population; 
To determine trough palbociclib plasma concentration in this patient population and explore the 
correlations between exposure and response and/or safety findings; 
To characterize alterations in genes, proteins, and RNAs relevant to the cell cycle (e.g., CCND1 
amplification, CDKN2A deletion), drug targets (eg, CDK 4/6), and tumour sensitivity and/or resistance 
(e.g., Ki67, pRb) in tumour tissues. 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was determined based on the assumptions that the median PFS for patients 
receiving placebo plus letrozole in the first-line treatment setting was 9 months and a risk reduction by 31% (a 
HR of 0.69) or an improvement by 44% to median PFS of 13 months in the palbociclib plus letrozole treatment 
was clinically significant. A total of 347 events were needed in the 2 arms of the study based on a 2:1 
randomization to have 90% power to detect a HR ratio of 0.69 in favor of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm using 
a 1-sided, log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025. A total sample size of approximately 650 patients (~433 
in palbociclib plus letrozole arm and ~217 in placebos plus letrozole arm) was required. 
The sample size described above will also allow the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of 
overall survival (OS) with a high level of significance.  
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by site of disease (visceral versus non-visceral), disease-free interval since the end 
of (neo)adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence (de novo metastatic versus ≤12 months versus >12 months), 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 74/140 
  
  
and nature of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies (prior hormonal therapy versus no prior hormonal 
therapy). “Visceral” refers to any lung (including pleura) and/or liver involvement. "Non-visceral" refers to 
absence of lung (including pleura) and/or liver involvement. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. 
Statistical methods 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who are randomized, with study drug assignment 
designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether patients receive study drug or receive a 
different drug from that to which they were randomized. The ITT population will be the primary population for 
evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient characteristics. 
The MITT population will include all patients who are randomized, with the Sponsor designated central 
laboratories confirmed ER (+) status, with study drug assignment designated according to initial randomization, 
regardless of whether patients receive study drug or receive a different drug from that to which they were 
randomized. This will be the secondary population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints as well as patient 
characteristics. 
The as-treated (AT) population or safety analysis set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study 
medication, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received. The AT 
population will be the primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety. 
Efficacy and clinical benefit endpoints may be assessed in this population as well. 
Time-to-event endpoints between the 2 treatment arms will be compared with a 1-sided stratified log-rank test 
adjusting for Site of disease and/or a 1-sided unstratified log-rank test at the α=0.025 overall significance level. 
Hazard ratios and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (subject to the multiplicity adjustment at the final analysis 
for PFS and OS) will be estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. 
Time-to-event endpoints between the 2 treatment arms will be compared with a 1-sided stratified log-rank test 
adjusting for Site of disease and/or a 1-sided unstratified log-rank test at the α=0.025 overall significance level. 
Hazard ratios and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (subject to the multiplicity adjustment at the final analysis 
for PFS and OS) will be estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. 
The study was designed to have 1 interim analysis and the final analysis at 347 events based on the primary 
endpoint of PFS. The Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary for rejecting the null hypothesis was used at the time of 
the interim analysis. The interim analysis of PFS was to be performed after at least 226 patients had documented 
progressive disease or died (approximately 65% of the total events expected). The overall significance level for 
the efficacy analysis of PFS was preserved at 0.025 (1-sided test).  OS will be hierarchically tested for 
significance at its interim analysis (at the time of the interim or final PFS analyses), provided the primary 
endpoint, PFS, is statistically significant at the interim PFS analysis, or at the final PFS analysis.

Recruitment 
Between 28 February 2013 and 29 July 2014, 666 women were randomized at 186 sites in 17 countries 
(Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Poland, 
Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States of America). Four hundred forty-four (444) 
patients were randomized to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, and 222 patients were randomized to the 
placebo plus letrozole arm. 
Conduct of the study 
Discontinuations due to protocol violations were infrequent <1% in both arms. A summary of significant protocol 
deviations was provided (abbreviated in table 25 below). Following assessment of the non-abbreviated version, 
it is considered that the observed protocol violations were unlikely to have affected the overall efficacy or safety 
results of the study.

Discontinuation 
Informed consent deviation 
The current protocol version, Amendment 6 dated 07 April 2015, was provided, including a summary of, and 
rationale for, all changes since original protocol. Changes of importance included the following: 
Based on preliminary results from two clinical pharmacology studies (A5481018 and A5481021) the drug 
administration instructions were amended (Amendment 2, 03 January 2014) from administration in a minimally 
fasted state to administration with food and also to prohibit the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors. Due 
to a concern that these effects might affect the power of the study the protocol was amended prior to the interim 
analysis to increase the sample size from 450 patients to 650 patients to preserve the desired statistical power 
(Amendment 3, 21 March 2014). The protocol was also amended to implement prospective ophthalmic 
assessments in all newly enrolled, lens grading patients at baseline and while on study treatment (Amendment 
3), and to prospectively characterize whether or not palbociclib affects glucose metabolism, through monitoring 
of appropriate laboratory measurements (Amendment 4, 18 September 2014). In Amendment 5 (02 December 
2014), the interim analysis was revised to ensure that the study would only be stopped at the interim analysis 
if the primary analysis (PFS) results are statistically significant and clinically meaningful, due to a concern that 
the planned minimum of about 4 months’ PFS improvement might not to be considered clinically relevant. In 
order to assess the breast cancer specific quality of life of patients beyond progression in the follow-up period, 
patient reported outcomes using the FACT-B questionnaire will continue to be collected every 6 months 
(Amendment 6, 07 April 2015). 
It is considered that the protocol amendments have not put the integrity of the study at risk.

The baseline characteristics are considered to be in overall balanced across arms. A 12% difference in ECOG 
performance status 0 is noted, but not considered important to the overall results. It is noted that 57% of 
patients in both study arms had prior hormonal therapy in the neo/adjuvant setting, and nearly half had prior 
chemotherapy.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint –Progression-free survival 
The final PFS analysis was conducted based on the data with the cut-off date of 26 February 2016. A total of 331 
patients had documented progressive disease (PD) or death in the final analysis. The secondary analysis of PFS 
based on BICR data is not available at this time. 
Among 331 patients with disease progression or death as PFS events, 194 (43.7% of 444 patients) were from 
the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 137 (61.7% of 222 patients) were from the placebo plus letrozole arm, 
respectively. 
The estimated HR was 0.576 (95% CI: 0.463-0.718; 1-sided p<0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus letrozole. 
The median PFS was 24.8 months (95% CI: 22.1-NE) for palbociclib plus letrozole and 14.5 months (95% CI: 
12.9-17.1) for placebo plus letrozole (Figure 13, Table 27).

Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival  
A planned OS interim analysis was performed at the time of the final PFS analysis based on 133 deaths (34% of 
390 events for final analysis) from 666 patients. Since the pre-specified level of significance was not met, the OS 
data will be continuously followed for the final analysis when 390 deaths have been observed. The median 
follow-up time for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was 23.0 months (95% CI: 22.6-23.4) and for the placebo 
plus letrozole arm was 22.3 months (95% CI: 21.9-22.9). No OS conclusions can be made due to the immaturity 
of the data. The patients will continue to be followed for the final OS analysis.

The subgroup analysis showed overall consistent results in all pre-specified subgroups, indicating robustness of 
the PFS results. 
PFS in relation to Rb expression 
Tissue samples from 568 of 666 enrolled patients were suitable for all biomarker testing and had results for 
analysis, of which 379 (66.7%) were from patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 189 (33.3%) from 
patients in the placebo plus letrozole arm. Total Rb protein expression had been evaluated using a validated IHC 
assay at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. Overall, 563 patients had 
evaluable Rb testing results.

Only patients with Central Laboratory data are included in the analysis. Positive was defined as H-Score ≥1 and negative as H-Score <1. 
H-Score was calculated as the sum of the percentage of cells at each level of staining intensity (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+) multiplied by the staining 
intensity value: 
H-Score=(% at 0)*0+(% at 1+)*1+(% at 2+)*2+(% at 3+)*3. 
H-Score values range from 0 to 300.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Critical visceral disease 
According to current international treatment guidelines, endocrine therapy is not recommended in patients with 
critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, due to a lower expectancy of a rapid tumour 
response or relevant tumour shrinkage compared with (cytotoxic) chemotherapies.  
Studies PALOMA-3 and PALOMA-2 excluded patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral spread, 
that are at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term, including patients with massive uncontrolled 
effusions (pleural, pericardial, peritoneal), pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement. 
The table below provides available data on time to response (TTR) and objective response rates (ORR) for the 
pivotal studies.

Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Randomized Study Of The Safety, Efficacy, And Pharmacokinetics Of 
Letrozole Plus Pd 0332991 (Oral Cdk 4/6 Inhibitor) And Letrozole Single Agent For The First-Line 
Treatment Of ER-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer In Postmenopausal Women 
Study design, randomisation and treatments 
The phase 1 stage enrolled 12 patients with the aim to confirm the tolerability of combining palbociclib with 
letrozole. Palbociclib 125 mg daily for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest as add-on to letrozole daily for 4 
weeks showed acceptable tolerability and 4 partial responses were reported.  
The initial Phase 2 study design included 150 patients randomized 1:1 to receive palbociclib plus letrozole (Arm 
A) or letrozole alone (Arm B). Letrozole was administered at standard dose according to label. Based upon 
evolving preclinical data suggesting that the tumours with CCND1 amplification and/or loss of CDKN2A/ 
p16INK4A gene were particularly sensitive to palbociclib, the design was revised. After a number of 
amendments the final study design was set as follows:

Study participants 
Key eligibility criteria included: Postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally recurrent or 
metastatic breast cancer, measurable disease according to RECIST 1.0 or bone-only disease (Phase 2 only), 
ECOG performance status 0 or 1, adequate blood counts and organ function, and no prior/current brain 
metastases. For full inclusion/exclusion criteria, see below. 
Inclusion Criteria 
Patients must have met all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study: 
1. Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of 1) locally 
recurrent disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent, or 2) metastatic disease. 
2. ER-positive tumour. Positivity was defined either as ≥10 fmol of tritium (H3)-oestrogen binding per mg of 
cytosol protein for dextran-coated charcoal and sucrose density methods, or ≥0.10 fmol of H3-estrogen binding 
per mg of DNA for immunofluorescence (IF)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) technique. In case of 
use of immunohistochemistry (IHC), the report was to mention positive receptor status according to the 
standards of the laboratory. 
3. HER2-negative breast cancer by FISH or IHC. 
4. Paraffin-embedded tumour block(s) available for centralized assessment of Rb and other cell cycle-related 
proteins. Ph2P2 only: CCND1 amplification and/or loss of CDKN2A as determined by the central laboratory. 
5. Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST Version 1.0) or 
bone-only disease (Phase 2 only). Previously irradiated lesions were deemed measurable only if progression was 
documented at the site after completion of radiation. 
6. Female patients, 18 years of age or older. 
Postmenopausal status defined as:

ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, nefazodone, diltiazem, and delavirdine) 
– for both Phases 1 and 2; 
• Drugs that are known strong CYP3A4 inducers (ie, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentin, and St. John’s Wort) – for Phase 1 only.

9. Known hypersensitivity to letrozole or to any of its excipients. 
10. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may have 
increased the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may have 
interfered with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would have made the 
patient inappropriate for entry into this study. 
Brain metastases, spinal cord compression (including history of), carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal 
disease were excluded. Overall, patients actually enrolled appear typical for a first-line, metastatic ER+ and 
HER2- negative breast cancer study. As expected in a small study, there were some imbalances in baseline 
factors of possible prognostic importance; these are outlined below. 
Treatments 
Phase 2: 
In all cycles, letrozole 2.5 mg (Femara, filmcoated tablet) was administered on a continuous dosing regimen QD 
together with palbociclib (Arm A) or alone (Arm B). Letrozole was thus administered at standard dose according 
to label. 
Palbociclib was provided in bottles containing either 25 mg or 100 mg capsules (isethionate salt) to patients. The 
capsules were distinguished by their size. Palbociclib was given according to the 3/1 schedule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 98/140 
  
  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Standard efficacy endpoints based on standard definitions were used, including PFS, overall survival (OS), time 
to progression (TTP),objective response (OR), duration of response (DOR). Clinical benefit response (CBR) was 
defined as the occurrence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks.  
Screening/baseline tumour assessment was carried out within 4 weeks of start of treatment. Post-baseline 
tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks. Bone scans were carried out at baseline and every 12 
weeks thereafter. Objective tumour response was measured using RECIST (Version 1.0). All patients with 
responding tumours (CR or PR) had to have the response confirmed no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial 
documentation of response. 
Recruitment 
First patient screened: 15 September 2008. 
Data cutoff date: 29 November 2013.  
Between 25 September 2008 and 03 September 2009, a total of 12 women were enrolled in the Phase 1 part of 
the study at 3 sites in the United States. At the time of data cutoff for the Clinical Study Report (CSR) (29 
November 2013), 2 patients (16.7%) were ongoing in the study. 
Between 22 December 2009 and 12 May 2012, a total of 165 women were randomized in the Phase 2 part at 50 
sites in 12 countries: Canada (2 sites), France (2 sites), Germany (8 sites), Hungary (7 sites), Ireland (4 sites), 
Italy (1 site), Russia (4 sites), South Africa (1 site), Republic of Korea (2 sites), Spain (5 sites), Ukraine (4 sites), 
and the United States(10 sites). 
At the time of data cutoff for the CSR (29 November 2013), 19 patients (22.6%) and 8 patients (9.9%) were 
ongoing in the study in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and letrozole alone arm, respectively. 
Participant flow  
In Phase 2 (Ph2P1+Ph2P2), 84 and 81 patients were randomized to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 
letrozole alone arm, respectively. One patient in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 4 patients in the letrozole 
alone arm were randomized but not treated. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
In total 14/165 (8%) of patients in the phase 2 part pf Study 1003 had a protocol deviation defined as clinically 
significant, 4 of which were related to confirmation of post-menopausal status. It is considered unlikely that 
these deviations would have a major impact on the overall study results. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
There were 7 amendments to the original study protocol (dated 27 March 2008) and there were 3 amendments 
to the original statistical analysis plan (SAP, dated 19 May 2008).  
In summary, the protocol and SAP of study 1003 were amended significantly two times during study, first to 
divide the phase 2 study population into two cohorts where the second included only patients that were positive 
for factors believed to be predictive of response to the palbociclib treatment (Amendment #3, July 2010). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 99/140 
  
  
second major change was to analyse the two cohorts together (Amendment #5, June 2012). In addition, the 
maturity of the PFS data was reduced (Amendment #7, July 2013).  
Submission of all imaging studies (including photographs for superficial disease, if applicable) from patients in 
Phase 2 Part 2 to an independent core imaging laboratory for review was required from July 2010 (Amendment 
#3). From November 2011 (Amendment #6), analyses based on independent central review were introduced as 
a possibility in the efficacy analysis part of the protocol.  
Results 
Baseline data 
There were imbalances in age and weight across study arms, potentially due to the small size of the study. 
Somewhat older and lighter (with regard to body weight) patients were included in the letrozole arm compared 
with the palbociclib + letrozole arm. The age difference in mean and medians of approximately 1 -1.5 year in 
both the overall phase 2 population and in cohort 2, could potentially favour the experimental arm, which also 
had fewer patients in pre-menopausal age. 
Overall, the majority of patients had Stage IV disease (98%), ductal carcinoma (71%) and more than half of the 
patients had an ECOG performance status of 0. There was an imbalance between treatment arms in the time 
since diagnosis of breast cancer; the median time since diagnosis was 1.3 years (range: 0 to 27 years) in the 
palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared with 2.4 years (range: 0 to 40 years) in the letrozole alone arm. A higher 
percentage of patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared with the letrozole alone arm had Grade 3 
tumours (36.9% versus 22.2%) and had progesterone receptor-positive disease (77.4% versus 65.4%).  
In Phase 2 (Ph2P1+Ph2P2), the 2 treatment arms were generally balanced across the stratification factors of 
disease site and disease-free interval using the data based on randomization criteria. However, when using the 
CRF data, there were some imbalances between the 2 treatment arms: 
• A lower percentage of patients had visceral disease in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (44.1%) than in the 
letrozole alone arm (53.1%); 
• A higher percentage of patients had bone only disease in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (20.2%) than in the 
letrozole alone arm (14.8%). These discrepancies were due to the incorrect stratification factors being used at 
the time of randomization which were discovered retrospectively during data review and source data 
verification. Sensitivity analyses using CRF data was carried out to investigate the impact of the imbalances on 
the PFS results, using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models by investigator and BICR assessments. 
These indicated that the difference in disease site as per CRF with approximately 10% more visceral disease in 
the letrozole comparator arm will favour the experimental palbociclib+ letrozole arm in the comparison (BICR 
HR 0.4 for Non-visceral vs visceral). The difference in mean and medians of age of approximately 1 -1.5 years 
may on the other hand favour the comparator arm (BICR HR 0.5 for age ≥ 65 years vs. < 65 years. How these 
imbalances balance each other is difficult to discern, but adds uncertainty to the results. 
There are imbalances across arms with regard to prior anti-cancer treatment. Mostly these are in the direction 
of the comparator arm having received more prior therapy compared to the palbociclib-containing experimental 
arm. E.g. a higher percentage of patients in the palbociclib + letrozole arm compared with the letrozole alone 
arm had received no prior systemic therapy (52 vs. 46% in the full Phase 2 population, 50 vs. 41% in Part 2 
cohort.). Less pre-treatment generally implies more chance of response and could thus favour the experimental 
arm. The received types of prior chemotherapy were well-balanced across arms, however, as were the types and 
duration of prior anti-hormonal therapies.

Of the patients who had discontinued study treatment, 26% (17/65) in the palbociclib + letrozole arm compared 
with 15% (11/73) in the letrozole alone arm had not received next-line therapy. 
Biomarker analysis  
Enrolment of patients to the part 2 cohort (Ph2P2) was a priori defined as only to include biomarker positive 
patients without knowledge of the actual outcome of part 1 (Ph2P1). When Part 1 was analysed, however, it 
appeared as if the biomarker were non-predictive for outcome:

Primary endpoint – Progression-free survival 
The primary analysis of the primary objective was based on the investigator assessment of progressive disease. 
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) was also performed. See figure xxx below.

There is a marked difference between the investigator- and BICR-based curves of Ph2 Part1. The curve of the 
control arm is considerably lower while the curve of the experimental arm is somewhat better in the 
investigator-based compared with the BICR based analysis, indicative of major bias favouring the experimental 
arm in the investigator assessments. See further comments in the table below.

A number of discordance analyses were made, a selection is shown in table 39 above. The pattern in Part 1 
indicates a bias in the investigator assessments favouring the experimental arm, with 50% of PDs determined 
by investigator in the comparator arm were not confirmed by BCIR compared with only 21% in the experimental 
arm. Conversely, nearly half (47%) of the PDs in the experimental arm determined by the BCIR were not 
confirmed by the investigator compared with only 3% in the control arm. In addition, there were further 
tendencies of bias favouring the experimental arm in Part 1 with regard timing of PD declarations by investigator 
and BCIR, respectively, as for 5 (15%) patients in the experimental arm investigator declared PD more than 7 
days later than BCIR, compared with only 2 (6%) in the comparator arm.

In Part 2 the figures were similar across arms with regard to investigator assessed PD not confirmed by BCIR (24 
vs 22%), while a potential tendency of bias in favour of the experimental arm might be noted in the BCIR 
assessed PDs not confirmed by investigator.  
In the search for explanations for the deviant findings between INV and BICR results in Ph2Part1, the Applicant 
found that an imbalance in the number of progressions based on new bone and non-target bone disease 
contributed to the disagreement between INV and BICR (INV: 13 vs. 40% in palbociclib + letrozole vs. letrozole 
alone arms; BICR 27 vs. 22% for BICR, respectively). After censoring INV progression events in both arms that 
were not called by the BICR at the time of PD and were based upon bone, the clinical benefit with the 
combination treatment on PFS was maintained (HR 0.443; 95% CI, 0.283 to 0.694). It is apparent that this does 
not explain the whole difference between assessments, however, considering the HRs 0.3 vs 0.7 in the original 
analysis by INV and BICR, respectively.  
Taken together, these results indicate that Part 1 may be significantly biased and is therefore not suitable for 
licensure. The bias in the Phase 2 Part 1 cohort impacts also on the full Phase 2 results. Therefore only Part 2 
results are considered relevant to the efficacy assessment. No number of sensitivity analyses (in the full phase 
2 population) can compensate for the major bias identified in Part 1. Due to highly likely informative censoring, 
BICR data from Part 1 is not considered informative. It is noted that even if the likely informative censoring in 
BICR data could be overlooked, the BICR-based PFS results in the full Phase 2 population were not statistically 
significant (1-sided p=0.3, corresponding to 2-sided p= 0.6).  
Secondary endpoint results in Phase 2 Part 2: 
Overall survival: At an event rate of less 30% in the survival analysis, there is a weak trend in favour of the 
experimental arm: HR 0.8, 1-sided p=0.3.

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study 1023 was a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study comparing palbociclib vs. 
placebo as add-on to fulvestrant (+ goserelin in pre- and perimenopausal patients) in patients with hormone 
receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, whose disease had progressed after prior 
endocrine therapy.  
The treatment arms were well balanced with regard to the stratification factors either based on randomization or 
based on the CRF. Neither the inclusion/exclusion criteria violations nor the changes to the protocol and SAP 
appeared to have put the integrity of the study at risk. There were no objections to the overall study design. The 
baseline disease characteristics were similar across study arms. Small imbalances were noted but were not 
considered likely to affect the overall study results.

The study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis (data cut-off 
05 Dec 2014), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a clinical meaningful treatment 
effect. A number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary analysis.  
Overall survival data were immature and thus non-informative with in total 28 deaths and event rates of 5% in 
both arms at the interim analysis. Therefore, two updated analyses were performed for investigator-based PFS, 
ORR, CBR and DOR at a median of 8.9 months follow-up (data cut-off 16 March 2015) and over 15 months (data 
cut-off 23 October 2015), respectively. In the second update, performed at an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 
76%), the PFS HR was 0.50 (0.36-0.59). Median PFS was 11.2 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a difference of 6.6 months. 
Thus in the updated analysis, the difference between arms has increased from 5.7 to 6.6 months. 
In updated PFS subgroup analyses, all subgroup HR point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% 
confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results.  
At a pre-specified interim OS analysis (data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015) there were in total 112 deaths (21%) 
in both arms; 20.5 vs. 23.6% (experimental vs. control). No deaths in the palbociclib arm were due to toxicity. 
The formal statistical analysis of OS will be performed during the planned OS interim analysis and final analysis.  
At this time, there are no signs of a detrimental effect on OS. The final analysis of Overall Survival is projected 
to occur by Q4 (Dec) 2017. The Applicant has committed to submit these results by Q2 (June) 2018. 
The difference in OR and CBR supports the PFS results. 
Study 1008 was a 2:1 randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study comparing palbociclib vs. 
placebo as add-on to letrozole as first-line treatment of postmenopausal patients with ER-positive, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.  
The baseline characteristics appear overall balanced across arms. A 12% difference between study arms in 
ECOG performance status 0 was noted, but not considered important to the overall results.  
The study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS. The final PFS analysis (data cut-off 
26 February 2016) was performed at an event rate of 50%, with 44% events in the palbociclib-containing arm 
and 61% in the placebo+ letrozole arm. The estimated HR was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.46-0.72; 1-sided p<0.000001) 
in favour of palbociclib plus letrozole, with a difference in PFS medians between arms of 10.3 months (24.8 vs. 
14.5 months, with non-overlapping confidence intervals).  
The results of a secondary PFS analysis based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) support the 
primary investigator based analysis.  
The results of the primary endpoint are supported by secondary outcome measures (ORR and DOR).  
A planned OS interim analysis was performed at the time of the final PFS analysis based on 133 deaths, but the 
results were not presented because they were considered as being immature. The final OS analysis is planned 
at 390 events and will be submitted for regulatory assessment. Given the large treatment effect observed on 
PFS, and the assessment of non-PD deaths not raising any new safety concerns, a detrimental effect of 
palbociclib on OS is considered unlikely.  
The frequency of Rb-negativity by IHC in Study 1008/ PALOMA-2 was non-trivial at 9%. A higher HR was 
observed in the small Rb-negative subpopulation compared with the Rb-positive group, and compared with the 
overall HR in the ITT. While alternative mechanisms of action may be hypothesised, in the presence of preclinical 
data suggesting requirement of intact an Rb-function for the activity of palbociclib, the presence of relevant 
clinical efficacy of palbociclib in the Rb-negative subgroup cannot be concluded without further study. 
Information on Rb is therefore given in the SmPC to inform the prescriber.

The updated indication sought based on Study 1008 and Study 1023 was worded as follows:  
 “IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, 
- in combination with fulvestrant in patients who have received prior endocrine therapy 
In pre- or perimenopausal women the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing hormone 
releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist” 
This proposed indication includes a number of extrapolations from the respective pivotal trials:  
• 
• 
• 
from letrozole to any aromatase inhibitor (AI) (Study 1008) 
from goserelin to any LHRH agonist (Study 1023) 
from fulvestrant + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal patients (Study 1023), and from AI in postmenopausal 
patients (Study 1008), to combination with AI + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women 
The extrapolation from letrozole to aromatase inhibitors is considered acceptable based on the following facts: 
• 
The PD effect of all AIs is the same (blocking the conversion of androgens to oestrogens by blocking the 
aromatase enzyme) 
•  AIs are used interchangeably in the clinic (depending on individual patient tolerability etc.) 
• 
There are no DDI/PK issues between anastrozole or exemestane (not studied in clinical trials) and 
palbociclib that preclude the extrapolation (See PK section) 
For the corresponding reasons, the extrapolation from goserelin to LHRH analogue is endorsed. 
The extrapolation to AI + LHRH in premenopausal women can be accepted. Efficacy has been shown for 
palbociclib in combination with AI in postmenopausal patients, and in combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in 
pre/perimenopausal patients, supporting the extrapolation. Furthermore, AI + LHRH constitute an accepted 
alternative (to antioestrogens/SERMs) in premenopausal patients, including as first line therapy, according to 
current clinical practice and European and international therapy guidelines. From a mechanistic perspective, 
palbociclib acts downstream of the oestrogen receptor (ER), and effective inhibition of ER signalling is achieved 
with AI or fulvestrant (+LHRH) alike, as this is the basis for anti-tumour activity of these compounds. This 
further supports that palbociclib can be used as add-on, not only to fulvestrant +LHRH, but also to AI +LHRH. 
Critical visceral disease 
According to current international treatment guidelines, endocrine therapy is not recommended in patients with 
critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, due to a lower expectancy of a rapid tumour 
response or relevant tumour shrinkage compared with (cytotoxic) chemotherapies.  
This patient population was also excluded from Studies PALOMA-3 and PALOMA-2, and palbociclib is not a 
traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agent, but acts through induction of growth arrest and senescence. Overall, 
the addition of palbociclib improved substantially on the clinical efficacy of the endocrine backbone, however. In 
both pivotal studies, ORR overall (ITT) was improved by 10-11%, and PFS by 5-10 months, respectively. In 
patients with visceral disease in PALOMA-3, the ORR was improved by 17% (from 7 to 24%), PFS was improved 
by 4.5 months (from 3.5 to 8 months) and Time to response (TTR) was improved by 1.7 months (from 5.4 to 3.7 
months). For PALOMA-2, results on the visceral subgroup are currently only available for PFS, with an 
improvement by add-on palbociclib to letrozole of 6.3 months (from 19.2 to 12.9 months).  
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 107/140 
  
  
With regard to critical visceral disease, a rapid response to therapy is of importance. There is little published data 
on TTR for comparison. From the very limited literature identified, mainly phase 2 studies in different lines of 
therapy in the metastatic setting, the data showed that the TTR of 3.7 months observed for palbociclib + 
fulvestrant as second line treatment, is more similar to the TTR of endocrine therapies (around 4 months) than 
of the chemotherapy combinations reported (around 2 months).   
Due to the limited information publicly available, and the many confounding factors such as line of therapy 
affecting cross-study comparisons, no firm conclusions can be drawn with regard to the time to response of 
palbociclib combinations relative to conventional chemotherapies, however. As the efficacy in general, as well as 
TTR for the palbociclib + fulvestrant combination, is clearly better for palbociclib combination therapy compared 
with the endocrine therapy alone, no restriction of indication is considered appropriate. Information has been 
introduced in the SmPC, however, to inform the prescriber of the ORR and TTR results for the visceral subgroups 
of studies 1008 and 1023 and that critical visceral disease was not studied. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) and Study 1008 (PALOMA-2), PFS results appear robust with regard to the level of 
statistical significance across analyses, the consistency of results in a number of PFS sensitivity analyses and in 
subgroups, and in terms of support from ORR and CBR analyses. Further data will be analysed for Study 1008 
when the full CSR will be submitted by March 2017. The magnitude of effect in both pivotal studies is considered 
of clear clinical relevance, with 5 and 10 months improvement in median progression-free survival (HRs 0.42 
and 0.58), respectively. While the data from both studies are still considered immature at a PFS event rate of 
50% (both studies) and an OS event rate of 21% and 20%, respectively, no sign of a detrimental effect on OS 
has been observed at this point (PALOMA-3), and is considered unlikely given the large treatment effect on PFS 
(PALOMA-2).  
The CHMP recommended that the final OS results from study 1023 should be submitted by June 2018.  
The CHMP also recommended that the final OS results from study 1008 should be submitted by November 2020. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database consists of approximately 2000 individuals including 1600 patients with malignancies 
whereof the vast majority were treated in breast cancer studies (n~ 1500 [studies 1023, 1003, 1010 Phase 1/ 
Phase 2, 1034, 1008, and 1001]).  
In addition and according to the A5481023 sNDA 90-Day Safety Update, approximately 10 000 patients received 
palbociclib in the US postmarketing setting from February 2015 through July 2015. 
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) 
Disposition update as of 31 July 2015: 
A total of 347 patients were randomised to the experimental arm of whom 345 received treatment while 174 
patients were randomised to the control arm of whom 172 were treated as of 31 July 2015. A total of 60 % in the 
experimental arm and 79 % in the control arm were permanently discontinued. Hence, 39 % in the palbociclib 
plus fulvestrant arm and 19.5% in the control arm were ongoing as of 31 July 2015. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 108/140 
  
  
Patient exposure 
The median number of cycles was fairly similar between the arms.  The median treatment duration was about 5 
months for both palbociclib and fulvestrant in the experimental arm and about 4 months for fulvestrant in the 
control arm.  
The relative dose intensity with a mean of 87 % and a median of 92 % for palbociclib and 97 % and 100 % for 
fulvestrant respectively, may indicate an acceptable tolerability of the combination. However, as observed in the 
1003 study, a high proportion of patients had at least one cycle delay (41 % with 22 % considered due to 
TEAEs), dose reduction (32 %) and/ or dose interruption (87 % with 54 % considered due to TEAEs) which may 
indicate certain tolerability concerns. 
Of the now 724 patients exposed to palbociclib 125 mg QD (3/1) in advanced breast cancer, 205 has been 
treated for ≥12 months. 
Update as of 31 July 2015: 
The median duration of palbociclib treatment was 330 (1 – 596) days as compared to the control arm (137 [14 
– 611] days). The median number of days on palbociclib was 221 (1 – 436) days vs. 102 (14 – 460) days for the 
control arm. The median relative dose intensity estimated for palbociclib was lower than that for placebo (89.8% 
[22% - 107%] and 99.5% [69% - 108%], respectively). 
Adverse events 
Table 41 - Overview of TEAEs All Causalities and All Cycles - As Treated Population (Study 1023) 
A higher proportion of AEs and Grade ≥3 were reported in the experimental arm compared to the control arm 
(98 % vs.89 % and 70 % vs. 18 % respectively). As opposed to what was observed in the 1003 study with

pablociclib in combination with letrozol, similarity in terms of SAEs and discontinuations were observed between 
the two arms.  
Rather few patients were permanently discontinued. On the other hand, the high proportion of temporary 
discontinuations of palbiciclob in the combination arm is noted (65 % vs 8 % in the control arm).

TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs Blood and lymphatic disorders (73 %), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (64 %), and General disorders and administration site conditions (61 %) in the experimental arm.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥20%) in the experimental arm were neutropenia (61 %), fatigue (38 %), 
nausea (29 %), WBC count decreased (27 %), anaemia (26 %), headache and neutrophil count decreased 
(21.2% each) and leukopenia (20%). In the control arm fatigue (27 %) and nausea (26 %) were reported. 
According to the CSR, febrile neutropenia was reported in two patients (0.6 %) in the experimental arm (both 
Grade 3). There are no reports on hyper-/hypoglycaemia. A total of 17 % reported eye disorders, mainly vision 
blurred (5 %), lacrimation increased (4.3 %), dry eye (3 %) and eye irritation (0.6 %). All were of grade 1/2.  No 
reports relevant to pancreas. One report judged as DILI was reported in the experimental arm.   
The safety update (as of 31 July 2015) does not reveal any difference from what is observed in the above table. 
Most TEAEs were of Grade 1/2 except for neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased and leukopenia which were 
most commonly of Grade 3 (67%, 63% and 64% respectively). 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported in about 10 % and 14 % in the experimental and control arms respectively. Most common 
in the experimental arm was pulmonary embolism and pyrexia (three patients each). Among the most common 
reported SAEs in the control arm were pleural effusion and ascites which is considered disease related. 
ECG QT prolonged and febrile neutropenia are reported in one case each.

A total of 15.4 % experienced at least one SAE in the experimental arm vs. 18 % in the control arm. Most 
common SAEs in the experimental arm included pyrexia (5 patients [1.4%]), neutropenia (4 [1.2%]), 
pulmonary embolism (3 [0.9%]) as well as deep vein thrombosis, dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, General

physical health deterioration, Pharyngitis, Pleural effusion, and suicide attempt (2 [0.6%] each). The remaining 
SAEs were experienced by one patient (0.3%) each.  
Among patients experiencing SAEs of any severity grade in the experimental arm (N=53), Grade 3 SAEs were 
reported for more than half of the patients (55 %), and Grade 4 SAEs were reported for 15 %). 
Deaths 
A total of six (1.2 %) patients died during the study (up to 28 days after last dose). All were judged to be 
associated with the disease investigated.  
Following the 28-day observation period after last dose, a total of 22 (4.3%) patients had died whereof 14 (4 %) 
patients in the experimental arm and 7 (4 %) patients in the control arm judged subsequent to the disease 
under study. 
Update on deaths as of 31 July 2015 data cut-off date: 
Table 44 - Summary of On-Study Deaths Reported in Study A5481023 as of 31 July 2015 — All Treated Patients 
Hence, no additional patient had died on study in the experimental arm during the eight months since previous 
data cut-off date while one patient in the control arm died (considered due to disease under study).   
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Almost all patients in the experimental arm with hematologic laboratory test results available for evaluation had 
abnormal white blood cell counts (98 %) and absolute neutrophil counts (95 %) as compared to 22 % and 8 % 
respectively for the control arm. 
In the experimental arm, anaemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 76 % and 57 % of the patients vs. 36 
% and 8 % in the control arm respectively. 
Clinical Chemistry 
No major concern is raised relevant to clinical chemistry. 
Hy’s Law 
One patient in each treatment arm met the laboratory criteria for a potential Hy's Law case although neither case 
was eventually considered to be a Hy's Law case as these patients also had elevations in alkaline phosphatase 
as well as alternative explanations for the laboratory changes.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
The vast majority were < 65 years of age. A total of about 25 % of the study population were ≥ 65. In terms of 
TEAEs, SAEs and discontinuations, no major difference between the two age groups were observed in either 
arm. Patients < 18 years were not eligible in the study. 
Race 
The vast majority was Caucasian (73 %) and the second largest was Asian (overall about 20 %).  
Gender 
Not performed as all patients enrolled were female.

Update with data cut-off date 31 July 2015: 
The overall proportion of TEAEs associated with temporary discontinuation was 69 % in the experimental arm 
vs. about 13 % in the control arm. Most commonly was neutropenia (48 %) and Neutrophil count decreased (17 
%) as well as white blood cell count decreased (8 %) and leukopenia (7 %). All but one TEAE of neutropenia 
were of Grade 3/4 severity.

Modification by MedDRA PT and Maximum Severity Grade Sorted by Decreasing Frequency (Grades 
1-4) for at Least 2 Patients Receiving Palbociclib Plus Fulvestrant (Study 1023) 
A total of approximately 32% in the experimental arm had their palbociclib dose reduced. According the 1023 
CSR, 29 % had their dose reduced from 125 mg QD to 100 mg QD and about 8 % from 125mg/100 QD mg to 
75 mg QD.  Palbociclib dose was reduced at least twice for 5 % of the patients.  
Update with data cut-off date 31 July 2015: 
A total of 128 patients (37.1%) in the experimental arm had their palbociclib dose reduced as of 31 July 2015: 
34 % had their dose reduced from 125 mg QD to 100 mg QD, and 12 % had their dose reduced from 125 mg to 
100 mg QD and further to 75 mg QD. Palbociclib dose was reduced at least twice for 31 patients (9.0%) in that 
treatment arm. In addition, 13 patients (3.8%) had their palbociclib dose regimen changed from Schedule 3/1 
to Schedule 2/2 (2 weeks on palbociclib treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment).

Deaths 
Table 54 - Summary of Deaths (As-Treated Population) 
A total of ten patients (2.3 %) died while on study (defined as up to 28 days after last dose) in the experimental 
arm vs. four (1.8 %) in the control arm (3/10 and 2/4 due to disease under study in the respective arms). 
The 7 deaths on study (within 28 days of last study dose) that were not due to progressive breast cancer 
included one case with treatment-related pneumonia, with death due to pulmonary failure, which should be 
considered as treatment-related. In addition, one case with death due to cardiogenic shock on Day 2 of 
treatment should be considered possibly related, since autopsy could not identify a cause. 
With regard to the 7 deaths during follow up (beyond 28 days after last dose of study treatment), the evaluation 
of the cases did not reveal signs of a relationship with the study treatment.

Study 1003 (PALOMA-1) 
The safety data from this Phase I/II study is considered providing merely support to the safety profile of 
palbociclib as identified in the two confirmatory studies 1023 and 1008. 
Patient exposure 
In terms of treatment duration for palbociclib in the combined Phase II population (Ph2P2) the median time was 
about 15 months. The relative dose intensity with a mean of 94 % and a median of 95 % indicates an acceptable 
tolerability.  
Adverse events 
Table 55 - Overview of TEAEs (All Causalities) - Phase 2: As Treated Set (Study 1003) 
A longer treatment duration of the combination arm compared to the control arm is recognised (median about 
15 and 8 months respectively). Overall a higher proportion of AEs, SAEs, Grade ≥3 (main contributors 
neutropenia and leukopenia), AEs that led to permanent or temporary discontinuation and dose reductions were 
reported in the experimental arm compared to the control arm. The one patient with a Grade 5 event died from 
PD. Note the difference between Part 1 and 2 with respect to discontinuations.  
All patients in the experimental arm reported at least one TEAE as compared with the letrozole arm (100 % vs. 
86 %).  
The following common TEAEs were reported substantially more common i.e. >10% difference,  for the 
experimental arm than those for the control arm: neutropenia (75% vs. 5%, respectively), leukopenia (43% vs. 
3.9%), fatigue (41% vs. 23%), anaemia (35% vs. 6.5%), nausea (30% vs. 14%), alopecia (22% vs. 2.6%), 
decreased appetite (21% vs. 6.5%), thrombocytopenia (19% vs. 2.6%), dyspnoea (18% vs. 8%), vomiting 
(18% vs. 4%), and upper respiratory tract infection (13% vs. 2.6%).

In study 1003, one case of hyperglycemia (Grade 2) and one case of hypoglycemia (Grade 1) were reported in 
the combination arm in the Phase 2 combined population. 
Please refer also to Discussion on Adverse Events of Special Interest (study 1003 and study 1023) below. 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 24% in the experimental arm and about 8% in the control arm experienced at least one SAE in the 
Phase 2 portion of the study as of that data cut-off date (02 January 2015). Most SAEs were reported for single 
patients, except pulmonary embolism that was reported for four patients (4.8 %) and back pain in two patients 
(2.4 %).  
One patient in the experimental arm of the Ph2P2 cohort experienced ischaemic colitis judged as 
treatment-related SAE.  
Deaths 
One patient died in the combination arm during the Phase 2 portion which was judged as due to disease 
progression. No patients died in the letrozole monotherapy arm.  
About 30 patients died during follow up (> 28 days after last dose). The vast majority were due to PD with a 
similar distribution between the two arms. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The overall proportions of TEAEs and permanent discontinuations due to TEAEs were similar between the two 
age groups in the experimental arm. SAEs were more frequently experienced by patients ≥65 years of age 
compared to the patients < 65 years of age in both treatment arms.   
The proportion of Grade 3/4 TEAE in the experimental arm was lower in patients ≥ 65 years of age (76 %) than 
that in patients < 65 years of age (85 %). 
Race 
The vast majority were caucasian (91 % and 90 % in the experimental arm and control arm respectively).  
Gender 
No analysis by gender was performed for the safety data as all patients enrolled were women. 
Discontinuation and dose adjustments due to AES 
In the experimental arm 16 % of the patients in the Phase 2 combined, permanently discontinued vs. 2.6 % in 
the control arm. The main reason was as expected neutropenia (6 %) followed by fatigue (2.4 %). In the control 
arm one patient each permanently discontinued due to arthralgia and nausea. The magnitude of patients that 
permanently discontinued due to AES does not convey any concern and is deemed acceptable. 
The proportion of temporary discontinuations (64 %) was considered high. Not surprising the most common 
reported TEAES were events of myelosuppression. Overall a total of 54% experienced hematologic TEAEs 
leading to temporary discontinuation from treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 124/140 
  
  
A total of 37% in the experimental arm experienced TEAEs leading to palbociclib dose reduction in the Phase 2 
portion of the study. Most commonly reported TEAEs leading to dose reduction were neutropenia (29%), 
leukopenia (7%), thrombocytopenia (2.4%) and fatigue (2.4%). 
Adverse events of special interest (Studies 1023 and 1003) 
Based on data of palbociclib in non-clinical studies, the following events of special clinical interest have been 
identified: myelosuppression (neutropenia-related and thrombocytopenia-related events), QT interval 
prolongation, eye disorders including cataracts, respiratory disorders including interstitial lung disease and 
pneumonitis and venous thromboembolic disorders.  
Myelosuppression 
Neutropenia 
A total of 76 % and 79 % reported neutropenia as TEAEs in study 1003 and 1023 respectively. Grade 3 and 4 
events of neutropenia were 51% and 6 % respectively in study 1003 with no cases of febrile neutropenia, 
neutropenic sepsis or neutropenic infection reported. The corresponding figures in study 1023 were 53 % and 9 
% respectively where there were two cases of febrile neutropenia reported in the experimental arm and one in 
the control arm. Both were associated with a Grade 4 event.  
In study 1003, regardless of the severity grade the median time from first dose to onset of first episode of 
neutropenia was shorter than one treatment cycle ( i.e. 28 days [for palbociclib 3 w on; 1 w off]). The minimum 
median time for any grade of neutropenia to onset was about 13 days. 
Most patients in the experiemental arm who were reported for neutropenia did not concomitantantly have 
infection related TEAEs. The types of infections/ infestations observed for those that were reported to have 
concommitant infections (38 %) were mainly of Grade 1 or 2 with no cases of Grade 4 or 5. Most common were 
upper respiratory tract infections (nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis and rhinitis).  
In study 1023, about 50 % of the patients in the experimental arm had had neutropenia of Grade 3 maximum 
severity and 9 % had Grade 4 maximum severity in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm.  For any grade 
neutropenia, the shortest time from first dose to onset was similar between the treatment arms about 14 days.  
As observed in the 1003 study, the median time from first dose to onset of first neutropenia episode regardless 
of grade was 15 days. 
The median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia and Grade 4 neutropenia was 15 days and 9 days respectively.   
The duration of neutropenia by patient regardless of severity grade was longer than one treatment cycle in the 
vast majority of patients (92 %) in the experimental arm. 
Considering the overall high incidence and severity (mainly Grade 3) of neutropenia, it is notable that overall few 
cases of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection have been reported.  Given the fairly low 
proportion of permanent discontinuations, it may be assumed that neutropenia can be managed with measures 
like dose reductions and dose interruptions. Based on cumulative, and ‘by treatment duration’ data provided by 
the Applicant, there is also no indication of a cumulative toxicity of palbociclib with regard to either neutropenia 
or febrile neutropenia. About 10 % received G-CSF in the studies.  
Febrile neutropenia will continue to be monitored in ongoing clinical studies and in the RMP (important identified 
risk of myelosuppression).

Thrombocytopenia 
In the 1003 (Phase 2 combined) a total of 23 % of the patients in the experimental arm experienced 
thrombocytopenia vs. 2.6 % in the control arm. Grade 3 and 4 were 1.5 % and 0.6 % respectively. 
In the 1023 study, 19 % of the patients in the experimental arm experienced thrombocytopenia while none in 
the control arm. A total of six patients had a maximum of Grade 3 and two patients had a maximum of Grade 4.  
It is noted that no events of bleeding were reported in association with thrombocytopenia. 
QT interval prolongation 
From non-clinical observations, a potential of palbociclib for QT prolongation and hemodynamic effects was 
identified from in vitro assays and/or in vivo cardiovascular dog studies. 
Furthermore the palbociclib exposure-response relationships for the ECG endpoints (RR and QTc intervals) were 
developed using data from Studies 1001, 1002, and 1003. The exposure-response relationships for RR and QTC 
intervals was described by linear mixed effects models, indicated no effect on heart rate of palbociclib and a 
rather flat QT-exposure relationship. 
In study 1003, one patient in the experimental arm and two patients in the control arm had a maximum increase 
of≥ 60 msec from baseline. No patients had >500 msec as maximum postbaseline value. 
In study 1023, a total of 73 patients in the experimental arm and 74 patients in the control arm were evaluable 
i.e. had both baseline and postbaseline ECG data. None of the patients in the experimental arm had a 
postbaseline QTcF of ≥500 msec.  The proportion of patients with a postbaseline QTcB of ≥500 msec was higher 
in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm (5.5%) than that in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (1.4%).  The 
proportions of patients with a >60 msec maximum increase from baseline in QTcF were similar between the two 
treatment arms. The proportion of patients with a >60 msec maximum increase from baseline in QTcB was 
higher in the experimental arm compared to the control arm.   
No TEAEs of syncope, cardiac arrest, convulsion, sudden death, death, Torsade de pointes, ventricular 
fibrillation, ventricular flutter and ventricular tachycardia have been reported. 
From the clinical perspective, observations in the 1003 and 1023 study do not reveal any clear causality between 
QT prolongation and the addition of palbociclib to either letrozole or fulvestrant. 
QTc Substudy  
Study 1008 included a QTc analysis substudy that was conducted as the definitive QTc prolongation evaluation 
for the palbociclib program.  
QTc Analysis Substudy Conclusions 
- In the QTc analysis population, QTcS was the best correction factor to account for the effect of heart rate on QT 
interval, followed by QTcF and QTcB.  
- In the QTc analysis population, no patients from either treatment arm had a post-baseline absolute mean 
maximum QTcS or QTcF ≥500 msec or an increase from QTcS or QTcF baseline value ≥60 msec during the 
intensive QTc assessment period. 
- A random effect analysis of the QTc data in the QTc analysis population demonstrated that the upper bounds 
of the 1-sided 95% CI for the mean change from clock time-matched baseline for QTcS and QTcF were all <8 
msec at all time-points in the QTc assessment period.

Thus, no indication of a QT-prolongation effect was found in this QT substudy inStudy 1008/PALOMA-2, intended 
as the definitive QT prolongation evaluation for the palbociclib programme. It should be noted that no thorough 
QT study has been performed, however, and that supratherapeutic doses have not been clinically evaluated. 
From a PK point of view, the risk of achieving an exposure four times the normal exposure (i.e. the exposure 
level where a preclinical study indicated a QT-signal) appears low, however. Theoretically possible, but unlikely, 
scenarios include: 
-  Concomitant inhibition of the enzymes CYP3A4 och SULT2A1 mainly responsible for the elimination. 
(Inhibition of only one is not expected to lead to a 4 x increase in exposure) 
-  Severe hepatic impairment (A PAM is requested) 
-  Normal variability, considered unlikely to achieve 4 x increase in exposure. 
QT prolongation is included in the RMP as an Important Potential Risk. 
Eye disorders including cataracts 
From non-clinical findings, cataracts/lens degeneration was identified in rats in association with altered glucose 
metabolism (glycosuria and/or hyperglycaemia).  A further association was found between glucose metabolism 
and pancreatic islet vacuolation. 
Hyperglycemia/ Diabetes 
In the Phase 2 portion of the 1003 study, one patient in the experimental arm experienced Grade 2 
hyperglycaemia which was considered unrelated to treatment.  
In the 1023 study, a total of three patients (0.9%) in the experimental arm and two patients (1.2%) in the 
control arm experienced hyperglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia was proposed as Important Potential Risk in the RMP which was endorsed. In addition, the 
Applicant states that prospective monitoring of hemoglobin A1c was added to characterise whether or not 
palbociclib affected glucose metabolism. No hemoglobin A1c data to report was available as of data cutoff date. 
This will be separately reported. A study addressing this issue is on-going. 
Respiratory disorders including interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis 
From non-clinical observations, clinical and microscopic findings in single- and repeat-dose rat toxicity studies 
were suggestive of a potential for palbociclib to affect the respiratory system. 
Respiratory associated TEAEs were overall more common in the combinations arms in study 1003 and study 
1023 (48 % and 35 % as compared to their comparators (26 % for letrozole and 27 % for fulvestrant). The most 
frequently reported events in study 1003 were dyspnoea (18 %), cough (13 %) and epistaxis (11 %) and in 
study 1023 cough (13 %), dyspnoea (11 %), oropharyngeal pain (9 %), and epistaxis (5.5%). 
The individual types of TEAEs and the distribution thereof are fairly similar between the two studies. Interstitial 
lung disease/Pneumonitis was included in the RMP as Important Potential Risk which was supported. 
Venous thromboembolic disorders 
The increased risk of pulmonary embolism associated with malignancy alone which may yet increase with the 
administration of chemotherapy, endocrine treatment (venous thromboembolic events are known adverse drug 
reactions to both letrozole and fulvestrant) as well with other drugs is well known. Notwithstanding, there were 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 127/140 
  
  
six events of pulmonary embolism reported in the experimental arm in study 1003 while none in the letrozole 
alone arm. Likewise in study 1023 there were events (three cases) in the experimental arm while none in the 
control arm. This may be, as suggested by the Applicant, due to differential treatment duration.   
Of note, on study 1008 (Phase III palbociclib/letrozole vs. letrozole alone), there were six events (1.4 %) of 
pulmonary embolism in the experimental arm while five (2.3 %) in the control arm. 
Immunological events 
This has not been addressed in the dossier and will not be required. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database consists of approximately 2000 individuals including 1600 patients with malignancies 
whereof the vast majority were treated in breast cancer studies (n~ 1500 [studies 1023, 1003, 1010 Phase 1/ 
Phase 2, 1034, 1008, and 1001]).  
In terms of exposure, in the 1003 study relative dose intensity for palbociclib was high (mean of 94 %, median 
of 95 %) while to lesser extent in the 1023 study (mean of 87 %, median of 90 %) although indicative of an 
acceptable tolerability  for the respective combinations The add on of palbociclib to either letrozole or fulvestrant 
appears not to convey any major concerns in regard to any added or heightened safety issue deriving from the 
accompanying treatments.  
The treatment duration was longer in study 1003 (median about 15 months for palbociclib/ letrozole arm vs. 8 
months for the letrozole alone arm) than in study 1023 (median 5 months for palbociclib/ fulvestrant vs. 4 
months for fulvestrant alone) although bearing in mind the different settings of the two studies i.e. 1st and 2nd 
line respectively. 
Study 1023 
A higher proportion of AEs (98 % vs. 89 %), Grade 3/4 (70 % vs. 18 %), AEs that led to temporary 
discontinuation and dose reductions (31 % vs. 1.7 %) were reported for the experimental arm compared to the 
control arm.  
It is recognised that few patients permanently discontinued the study or permanently discontinued palbociclib/ 
placebo or fulvestrant due to AEs. From a tolerability perspective this is reassuring. On the other hand, the high 
proportion of temporary discontinuations of palbiciclob in the combination arm is noted 65 % vs 8 % in the 
control arm. A total of 24 % temporarily discontinued fulvestrant in the experimental arm vs. about 4 % in the 
control arm. 
A substantially higher proportion of patients in the experimental arm (65 %) had TEAEs that led to temporary 
discontinuation from treatment as compared to control arm (8 %). 
The main causes leading to temporary discontinuations were as expected, haematology related. The vast 
majority of the overall TEAEs leading to this measure were judged treatment related (61 %). 
Study 1008 Summary of Top Line Results 
The Applicant has provided top line results from the confirmatory Phase III 1008 study investigating 
palbociclib+letrozole vs. placebo+letrozole. Almost all reported an AE (98.9 % and 95.5 % in the experimental 
and control arm respectively). In comparison between the two palbociclib+ letrozole arms in studies 1008 and 
1003 (Ph2P1+PhP2), a fairly similar proportion was observed in terms of SAEs (19.6 % vs. 21.7 %), Grade 3/4 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 128/140 
  
  
(77.5 % vs. 77.1 %), discontinuation due to AEs (2.5 % vs. 14.5 %), temporary discontinuation of palbociclib 
(74.8 % vs. 62.7 %) and dose reduction of palbociclib (36.0 % vs. 38.6 %).  
The most common TEAEs in the palbociclib+ letrozole arm included neutropenia, fatigue, nausea, arthralgia, 
alopecia, diarrhoea, cough, leukopenia and anaemia. 
Relevant to the high proportion of reports of neutropenia (66.2 % all grades, 46.6 % Grade 3), it is noted that 
febrile neutropenia was reported in a limited proportion (1.8 %). This is in line with what was observed in study 
1023 (0.9 %). In study 1003 there were no reports of febrile neutropenia. 
In regard to pulmonary embolism, six patients (1.4 %) in the experimental arm experienced pulmonary 
embolism (one fatal) while five (2.3 %) in the control arm (one fatal). 
A total of ten patients (2.3 %) died while on study (defined as up to 28 days after last dose) in the experimental 
arm vs. four (1.8 %) in the control arm (3/10 and 2/4 due to disease under study in the respective arms). Of 
the14 non-PD deaths, one death of pulmonary failure due to pneumonia is considered related to the palbociclib 
therapy; and one case of fatal cardiogenic shock on Day 2 of treatment of unknown cause is considered possibly 
related. No new safety concerns were raised based on the analysis of deaths in study 1008.  
From a safety perspective based on the data provided, it is agreed that the adverse events observed appears to 
be in line with what has previously been reported in studies 1003 and 1023. No new safety concern, trend or 
signal has been identified at this point. 
Study 1003 (Phase 2 [Ph2P1+Ph2P2]) 
Overall, the safety observations in study 1003 is consistent with study 1023 and what at this point is known from 
the 1008 top line results i.e. an acceptable low proportion of permanent discontinuations vs. the high proportion 
of temporary discontinuations, dose reductions and delays.  
Also in terms of TEAEs, Grade 3 and 4 events and SAEs the safety profile is consistent with the observations from 
the two Phase III studies with the main cause being events of myelosuppression and largely neutropenia. No 
cases neutropenic sepsis or neutropenic infection was reported in the Phase 2 portion of the study. 
Regardless of the severity grade the median time from first dose to onset of first episode of neutropenia was 
shorter than one treatment cycle (i.e. 28 days [for palbociclib 3 w on; 1 w off]). The minimum median time for 
any grade of neutropenia to onset was about 13 days. From the safety perspective 2 week on/ 2 week off 
regimen appears more appealing. 
The overall median duration of neutropenia by patient and any severity grade reported for the experimental arm 
was 147 days across all cycles with duration > 7 days for the vast majority of patients (94 %). The median 
duration of Grade ≥3 and Grade 4 events across all cycles was 48 days and 8 days respectively. 
Overall comments on studies 1023, 1008 and 1003  
More recent safety data has been requested during the procedure and for study 1023 the Applicant has 
submitted an A5481023 90-Day Safety Update (to support the A5481023 supplemental NDA (sNDA) to the FDA) 
with 31 July 2015 as data cut-off date. Additional safety up-dates have been provided with cut-off date February 
26 2016 for study 1023 (SAEs) and for studies 1008 and 1003 (data on AEs, laboratory test values and SAEs). 
Overall the safety profile is generally consistent through all studies. A more complete summary of clinical safety 
of study 1008 will be available by March 2017.

The add-on of palbociclib to letrozole or fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in 
events of myelosuppression largely neutropenia (mainly Grade 3) which has led to a high proportion of patients 
undergoing temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions in the respective experimental arms.  
It is notable however, that overall few cases of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection 
have been reported (none in study 1003).  Considering the fairly low proportion of permanent vs. the high 
proportion of temporary discontinuations, it may be assumed that neutropenia can be managed with measures 
like dose reductions and dose interruptions. Based on cumulative, and ‘by treatment duration’ data, there is also 
no indication of a cumulative toxicity of palbociclib with regard to either neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. 
Febrile neutropenia will continue to be monitored in ongoing clinical studies and in the RMP (important identified 
risk of myelosuppression). 
Of note, two cases of fatal hepatic toxicity have recently been reported with palbociclib associated to letrozole 
(Vuppalanchi R. et al [2016]: Pseudocirrhosis and liver failure in patients with metastatic breast cancer after 
treatment with palbociclib [Hepatology. doi:10.1002/hep.28720]).  
In addition to these two cases, there were 3 out of 179 cases of hepatotoxicity with palbociclib. However, based 
on these limited data in patients with hepatic metastasis, no clear relation between palbociclib and hepatic 
pseudocirrhosis can be evidenced. Consequently, for the time being, no modification of the SmPC will be 
required. The hepatotoxicity should be closely monitored through the MA. 
Pooled chemistry laboratory values as well as pooled hepatic laboratory values of subjects treated in studies 
1003 and 1023 were generally comparable between the palbociclib arms vs the comparator arms. Nonetheless, 
hypocalcemia and hypophosphataemia occurred more frequently in the palbociclib arm (respectively 30.6 % 
versus 18.6% and 39.2% versus 19.7%), but at mild/moderate grade (1 or 2).  
In study 1003 differences in the reporting frequencies of some adverse event parameters were observed 
between palbociclib treated subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to those <65 years of age.  This is thought to 
be most likely related to variability due to the relatively small number of subjects represented in each age group.  
In the larger and thus more representative study 1023, there was no notable difference in the incidence of SAEs. 
In regard to treatment duration by age-groups (median), no apparent difference between age group < 65 and 
≥65-74 is noted. The number of patients ≥ 75 years of age were limited in both study 1003 (n=8) and 1023 
(n=27) which preclude any firm conclusion to be drawn in this age group. No specific measures in the SmPC or 
RMP are proposed. This is considered acceptable. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The add-on of palbociclib to letrozole or fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in 
toxicity relative the respective comparators. The main underlying cause behind this is the palbociclib associated 
myelosuppression essentially neutropenia which however appears not to be translated into a corresponding high 
proportion of febrile neutropenia. Given the acceptable levels of exposure achieved and the fact that the 
magnitude and severities of the TEAEs reported did not translate into a corresponding high proportion of 
permanent discontinuations or a concerned high number of non-disease related deaths, it is concluded that 
palbociclib in its proposed combinations with supportive measures of dose adjustments as appropriate, is 
reasonably tolerable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of palbociclib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers palbociclib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ibrance is included in the additional monitoring list as 
it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product 
authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Breast  cancer  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  subtypes  having  varied  responses  to  anti-hormonal  and 
chemotherapy treatments.  Breast tumour types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, with 
one third of tumours being ER-negative and two thirds of tumours being ER-positive.   
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 133/140 
  
  
 
ER-positive tumours make up 65% of tumours in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumours in women 
older than 65 years16.  These cancers are largely oestrogen driven in postmenopausal women where the main 
source of the tumour’s oestrogen is from conversion of androgens to oestrogens via aromatase enzyme action.  
Modification of oestrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease 
and limited tumour-related symptoms 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Recommendations from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines, the European 
School of Oncology-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESO-ESMO) 2nd International Consensus 
Guidelines for Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC2), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend endocrine therapy as the preferred first-line treatment 
option for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (except for immediately 
life-threatening disease or when concerns exist regarding endocrine resistance). The choice between endocrine 
therapies for the initial treatment is often driven by prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, potential side effects, time 
to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal status. 
Currently, first-line treatment in the ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer postmenopausal 
population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, and 
tamoxifen6 with time to progression and prolongation of PFS ranging from 5 to 15 months.   
Presently, second and subsequent lines of therapy in the hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer 
population typically include endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, steroidal or nonsteroidal AIs, 
progestins, and androgens. In the pivotal studies for the present application, letrozole and fulvestrant were used 
as endocrine backbone therapy and comparators.  
In addition, postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that have 
progressed after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole may also receive everolimus (Afinitor) in combination 
with exemestane.  
Chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three main clinical studies Study 1023 (PALOMA-3), Study 1008 (PALOMA-2) and Study 1003 (PALOMA-1) were 
submitted in support of a proposed indication for palbociclib in combination with letrozole and fulvestrant, 
respectively.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PALOMA-3 (in combination with fulvestrant) 
An interim analysis was performed at a median of 5.6 months follow-up and an overall event rate of 37% 
(100/347 and 93/174 in experimental and comparator arm, respectively). At this point, the study met its 
primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS with hazard ratio (HR) 0.42 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.56; 
stratified 1-sided p-value <0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. The median PFS was 9.2 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016

(95% CI: 7.5, not estimable) for palbociclib plus fulvestrant and 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.5, 5.5) for placebo plus 
fulvestrant, and the difference in medians between arms was 5.7 months.  
In a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses HR remained stable around 0.4 in all analyses, indicating 
robustness of the results.  
A blinded independent central review (BICR) was performed on a randomly sampled subset constituting 40% 
(n=211) of the Intention-to-treat (ITT) population, showing HR 0.27, with similar median PFS in the control arm 
at 3.7 months, but median not reached in the palbociclib arm.   
Two updated efficacy analyses were performed based on investigator assessment. The latter occurred at a 
median follow-up of over 15 months in both study arms, and an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 76%). This 
showed a PFS HR of 0.50 (0.36-0.59) and median the PFS was 11.2 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a difference of 6.6 
months in favour of the palbociclib-containing arm. 
In updated PFS subgroup analyses all subgroup HR point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% 
confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results. Pre-/perimenopausal patients and 
postmenopausal patients had similar HRs, 0.46 and 0.52, respectively, both with confidence intervals below 1.0. 
Patients who had received 0 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting had a somewhat higher HR point estimate 
(0.59) than those with 1 or 2 previous lines of therapy for metastatic disease (0.46 and 0.48), but with 95% 
confidence interval below 1.0. 
In the updated analysis the difference in objective response rate (ORR), 21 vs 9% (non-overlapping confidence 
intervals, 1-sided p= 0.0001), and Clinical Benefit rate (CBR), 66 vs.40% (non-overlapping confidence 
intervals, 1-sided p<0.0001), supports the PFS results. Duration of response (DOR) was numerically but not 
statistically significantly longer in the experimental arm compared with the comparator arm, 10.4 vs. 9.0 
months. 
At a pre-specified interim analysis of overall survival (OS) (data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015), the event rate was 
21.5% of the total 521 patients (20.5% vs. 23.6%, for palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm, respectively). No death in the palbociclib-containing arm was due to toxicity.  
With regard to Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a time to event analysis was pre-specified for deterioration in 
pain (TTD), defined as first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in pain on study. Statistically 
convincing and plausible results were achieved with a difference in median time to deterioration of 8.0 vs 2.8 
months, HR 0.6, p <0.001.  
PALOMA-2 (in combination with letrozole) 
The final PFS analysis was performed at an event rate of 50%. The estimated HR was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.46-0.72; 
1-sided p<0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus letrozole. The median PFS was 24.8 months (95% CI: 
22.1-NE) for palbociclib plus letrozole and 14.5 months (95% CI: 12.9-17.1) for placebo plus letrozole, with a 
difference in PFS medians between arms of 10.3 months (with non-overlapping confidence intervals). 
The results of the primary endpoint are supported by secondary outcome measures. For objective response rate, 
based on confirmed responses, a difference between arms of 11% was noted, together with a 15% difference in 
disease control rate (CR+PR+SD ≥ 24 weeks). The difference in median duration of response) in responding 
patients with measurable disease at baseline appeared clinically relevant at 5.7 months. 
A planned overall survival (OS) interim analysis was performed at the time of the final PFS analysis based on 133 
deaths (20% event rate), but the results were not presented as being immature. The median follow-up time for 
the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was 23.0 months (95% CI: 22.6-23.4) and for the placebo plus letrozole arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 135/140 
  
  
was 22.3 months (95% CI: 21.9-22.9). There was one treatment-related death (infection), and one possibly 
related death in the palbociclib arm. 
The frequency of Rb-negativity by IHC in Study 1008/ PALOMA-2 was 9%. A higher HR was observed in the small 
Rb-negative subpopulation (n=51) at 0.675 (95% CI: 0.308, 1.481) compared with the Rb-positive group (n= 
512), HR 0.531 (95% CI: 0.416, 0.680).  
Indication 
Extrapolations from letrozole to any aromatase inhibitor, and from goserelin to any GnRH/LHRH analogue, are 
both considered acceptable based on mechanistic rationales supported by the clinical interchangeability of the 
products in question, together with a lack of PK and drug-drug interaction concerns for the products that were 
not studied. (see Discussion on Clinical Efficacy). 
The proposed extrapolation to combination of palbociclib with AI + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women, from 
combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women and from combination with AI in 
postmenopausal women, is considered acceptable based on the benefit observed in the pivotal studies, and on 
AI+LHRH being an established first line treatment option in premenopausal patients according to international 
guidelines. Also from a mechanistic perspective, the extrapolation is supported, since effective inhibition of 
oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling is achieved by both endocrine regimens and palbociclib acts downstream of 
the ER.  
PALOMA-1 (in combination with letrozole) 
For reasons described under “Discussion of clinical efficacy”, PFS results are considered likely to be without 
major bias only in the second part of the phase 2 trial (Ph2P2), presented below.  
Part 2 
At an overall event rate of 61% (26/50 and 34/49 in experimental and comparator arm, respectively), the 
investigator assessed PFS showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.51 at a 1-sided p-value of <0.005 with a median 
difference of 7 months (18 vs. 11). 
In the blinded independent central review (BICR) analysis, corresponding figures were 20/50 and 24/49, with an 
HR of 0.58 and a 1-sided p-value of 0.03 and a median difference of 5 months (20 vs. 15).  
At an event rate of 30% in the overall survival (OS) analysis, there is a weak trend in favour of the experimental 
arm in Part 2: HR 0.8, 1-sided p=0.3.  
Objective response rate (ORR) was similar in BICR-based ITT analysis, 28.0 vs 26.5% (n: 14/50 vs 13/49) 
1-sided p=0.5, and numerically higher in the experimental arm in in BICR-based analysis of patients with 
measurable disease, 45 vs 35% (n: 14/31 vs 13/37), 1-sided p=0.3. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Retinoblastoma protein status 
According to pre-clinical data, palbociclib lacks functional efficacy in Rb-negative cancer cell lines and animal 
models, demonstrating the importance of intact Rb function for the efficacy of palbociclib. Loss of Rb itself is 
rarely seen in ER positive breast cancer. The frequency of Rb-negativity by IHC in Study 1008 (PALOMA-2) was 
non-trivial at 9%, however, and the HR in this subgroup (n=51) had a wide confidence interval overlapping 1.0. 
In light of the preclinical background, the presence of relevant efficacy of palbociclib in this group cannot be 
Assessment report  
EMA/652627/2016 
Page 136/140 
  
  
concluded. It is acknowledged that alternative mechanisms of action may be hypothesised, and confounding of 
preclinical experiments related to the immortalisation of cell lines affecting Rb-status has been suggested, but 
these theories cannot be used to dismiss the actual preclinical findings. It is also noted that preclinical models of 
Rb-function are commonly based on genetic determination Rb-status, while in clinical studies protein expression 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is most frequently used, potentially impacting results differently. Considering 
the possibility that patients may have their tumours molecularly screened, providing information that includes 
Rb-status, information has been introduced in the SmPC to inform the prescriber, including results from 
preclinical models and the available clinical data. Furthermore, in order to potentially solve this uncertainty, the 
Applicant has committed to perform a non-clinical study investigating the activity of palbociclib in vitro and in 
vivo, as explants from human IHC Rb positive and IHC Rb negative fresh tumour samples, and if possible also 
based on genetic determination of Rb status. 
Critical visceral disease 
In patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, a rapid and high likelihood of 
response to therapy is of importance. Chemotherapy is therefore recommended for this group of patients, who 
were excluded from the PALOMA-3 and PALOMA-2 studies. In both studies, the addition of palbociclib 
substantially improved on both the PFS and ORR of the endocrine backbone, also in patients with (non-critical) 
visceral disease. Smaller /no improvement was observed for the clinically important Time to tumour response 
(TTR) in the visceral subgroups, however, and the observed TTRs around 4 months are difficult to contextualise 
due to the limited published data on TTRs of chemotherapies available for comparison. Information has 
therefore been introduced in the SmPC to inform the prescriber of the ORR and TTR results for the visceral 
subgroups of PALOMA-3 and PALOMA-2 studies, and that critical visceral disease was not studied.  
OS immaturity 
OS data for both pivotal phase 3 studies are immature have not been presented due to immaturity (20-21% 
event rate). Given the large treatment effect observed on PFS, and the assessment of deaths, which did not 
raise any new safety concerns, a detrimental effect of palbociclib on OS is considered unlikely, however.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were associated with myelosuppression largely neutropenia leading to a 
magnitude of temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions. Other frequently reported TEAEs 
were fatigue, infections, nausea, arthralgia, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea and alopecia. Most of the TEAEs were 
of Grade 1 or Grade 2 maximum severity except for neutropenia and leukopenia reported most commonly as a 
Grade 3 TEAE (for details please refer to the Effects Table). 
The safety findings observed in 1023, 1008 and 1003 including recent safety up-dates seem overall consistent 
which is reassuring. 
Considering the overall high incidence and severity of neutropenia, it is of note that overall few cases of febrile 
neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection have been reported.   
Given the fairly low proportion of permanent vs. the high proportion of temporary discontinuations, it may be 
assumed that neutropenia can be managed with measures like dose reductions and dose interruptions. Based on 
cumulative, and ‘by treatment duration’ data provided by the Applicant, there is also no indication of a 
cumulative toxicity of palbociclib with regard to either neutropenia or febrile neutropenia.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Palbociclib may have the potential to alter glucose homeostasis in humans in association with effects on the 
endocrine pancreas with effects on the eye, teeth, kidney, and adipose tissue considered secondary to the 
endocrine changes/glucose dysregulation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A prolongation of progression-free survival by 6-10 month’s in the early metastatic settings of breast cancer is 
of clear clinical value.  
The main safety risk associated with palbociclib is bone marrow suppression, essentially neutropenia that led to 
dose delay and dose reductions in about 1/3 patients. This type of toxicity is commonly encountered in oncology 
practice and easily managed, especially as neutropenic infections were uncommon. There is also no indication of 
a cumulative toxicity.

3.7.2.  Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) and Study 1008 (PALOMA-2) are both immature with regard to overall survival (OS), 
at event rates of 21% and 20%, respectively. For both studies, PFS results appear robust with regard to the level 
of statistical significance across analyses, the consistency of results in a number of PFS sensitivity analyses and 
in subgroups, and in terms of support from ORR and CBR analyses. Given the large treatment-effect on PFS, and 
that the evaluation of deaths on study and during follow-up did not raise concerns, a detrimental effect of 
palbociclib on OS is considered unlikely. The proposed indication includes a number of extrapolations from the 
respective pivotal trials. These extrapolations were considered acceptable based on the mechanism of action of 
palbociclib and the inhibition of downstream effectors of ER as well as based on the current accepted treatment 
paradigms published in European guidelines on breast cancer. Both pivotal studies are relatively immature, 
however, and the lack of mature data on overall survival will be addressed post-authorisation. 
The safety findings observed in studies 1023, 1008 and 1003 seem indeed consistent. The add-on of palbociclib 
to letrozole or fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in events of myelosuppression 
largely neutropenia (mainly Grade 3) which has led to a high proportion of patients undergoing temporary dose 
interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions in the respective experimental arms.  
It is notable however, that overall few cases of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection 
have been reported.  Considering the fairly low proportion of permanent vs. the high proportion of temporary 
discontinuations, it may be assumed that neutropenia can be managed with measures like dose reductions and 
dose interruptions. Based on cumulative, and ‘by treatment duration’ data, there is also no indication of a 
cumulative toxicity of palbociclib with regard to either neutropenia or febrile neutropenia.  
Given the magnitude of the clinical benefit observed and the relatively general low grades of the TEAEs reported 
which did not result in a high proportion of febrile neutropenia, permanent discontinuations or non-disease 
related deaths, it is concluded that palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor  or in combination with 
fulvestrant is reasonably tolerable. 
3.7.3.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP concludes that the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival and the 
manageable toxicity contribute to a positive B/R balance.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ibrance is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the risk-benefit 
balance of Ibrance is favourable in the following indication:

IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer:

- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor;  
in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Other conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be 
implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
The applicant compared the structure of palbociclib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers palbociclib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
(MAH) updated section 4.6 of the SmPC with information of 
the use of insulin glargine in pregnancy. In support of the 
application, the MAH presented results of a meta-analysis 
of published data on the use of insulin glargine compared 
to NPH in pregnancy, as well as additional available clinical 
data published up to 20 May 2013 and post-marketing 
data. 
The meta-analysis comprised 8 observational cohort studies 
with a total of 702 women with pregestational or 
gestational diabetes, of whom 331 received insulin glargine 
and 371 received NPH insulin. The meta-analysis examined 
maternal outcomes for efficacy and safety, and neonatal 
outcomes.  
The results of the meta-analysis did not reveal any 
significant increased risk associated with the use of insulin 
glargine compared with NPH insulin for any of the maternal 
or neonatal outcomes reported. With regard to the safety of 
insulin glargine use during pregnancy, in comparison to 
NPH insulin, there was no increased risk to the mother for 
weight gain, severe hypoglycemia, gestational/new-onset 
hypertension, preeclampsia, or cesarean section. While 
individual studies did inconsistently report differences, 
Page 11/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
many of the individual findings were favourable to insulin 
glargine. Glycaemic control as measured by first and third 
trimester HbA1c was not different between the pregnant 
women using insulin glargine and those using NPH insulin.  
The CHMP conclusion on the meta-analysis was that it 
supports the overall insulin glargine program results, but 
could not constitute a stand-alone demonstration of 
glargine efficacy and safety in pregnant women with 
diabetes due to the limitations of the observational non-
randomized design of the published reports. 
In addition to the meta-analysis the MAH also submitted a 
cumulative summary of exposure reports since the launch 
of the product and provided information received during the 
current 6-month reporting period through 21 October 2012. 
Pregnancy outcomes reported to date in this diabetic 
patient population do not suggest a new risk for patients 
treated with insulin glargine. This conclusion was endorsed 
by the CHMP.

Lantus prescribing information based on data from the 
ORIGIN trial (Outcomes Reduction with an Initial Glargine 
INtervention). This was a multinational 7-year randomized 
clinical study that investigated the effect of Lantus on 
cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in patients with 
prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired 
glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) who had evidence of CV disease. 
The first coprimary endpoint (composite of the first 
occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or 
nonfatal stroke) did not show any difference between 
insulin glargine and standard care. Also, the second 
coprimary endpoint (hospitalization for heart failure or 
revascularization procedure added to the first three 
components), did not show any difference. In addition, 
analysis by various subgroups did not reveal significant 
differences. Outcomes of secondary and tertiary endpoints 
were consistent. 
Therefore, it is concluded that early treatment with insulin 
glargine had no effect (beneficial or detrimental) on CV 
morbidity or cardiovascular and over-all mortality. This is 
an important finding that has been included in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
In subjects with prediabetes, there was a numeric 
reduction in the percentage of subjects developing diabetes 
at the first post-EUF OGTT, but this effect declined after 3 
Page 13/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months and was not clinically relevant.  
Cancer relationship to insulin glargine was not 
demonstrated in any cancer subtype (e.g. breast, colon, 
prostate, lung), or for new or recurrent cancers, or deaths 
from cancer, over 6.2 years of median follow-up. Kaplan-
Meier curves for the first cancer diagnosed during the trial, 
the first new cancer diagnosed, and death due to cancer 
were practically superimposable between the insulin 
glargine and standard care groups. Although this is 
important information, it has not been included in the 
SmPC because, (i) the design of the ORIGIN study was not 
anticipated in order to assess the risks of cancer (ii) it is 
questionable whether these results could be extrapolated to 
long-standing diabetes with high doses of insulin (iii) 
available epidemiological results regarding the risk of 
breast cancer for longer exposures to glargine are not fully 
consistent across different studies. 
No unexpected safety issues were seen in this trial. As was 
expected weight did increase, and hypoglycaemia was still 
the major adverse event seen in association with treatment 
with insulin glargine. Rates of hypoglycemia in ORIGIN 
might be lower than those seen in other CV intervention 
trials in diabetes; however, as no beneficial effect of insulin 
glargine could be detected in this trial, an increase in the 
incidence of hypoglycaemia is a disadvantage. 
In summary, any benefit of early treatment with insulin on 
lower levels of HbA1 without improvement in CV outcome is 
outweighed by its side effects and applicability. 
The following text was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
to describe the design and results of this study: 
“The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine 
INtervention) study was a multicenter, randomized, 2x2 
Page 14/35 
 
 
 
 
 
factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at 
high cardiovascular (CV) risk with impaired fasting glucose 
(IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12% of 
participants) or type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ≤1 
antidiabetic oral agent (88% of participants). Participants 
were randomized (1:1) to receive insulin glargine 
(n=6264), titrated to reach FPG ≤95 mg/dL (5.3 mM), or 
standard care (n=6273).  
The first co primary efficacy outcome was the time to the 
first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction 
(MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co primary efficacy 
outcome was the time to the first occurrence of any of the 
first co primary events, or revascularisation procedure 
(coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for 
heart failure. 
Secondary endpoints included all cause mortality and a 
composite microvascular outcome.  
Insulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease 
and CV mortality when compared to standard of care. 
There were no differences between insulin glargine and 
standard care for the two co primary outcomes; for any 
component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all 
cause mortality; or for the composite microvascular 
outcome.  
Mean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg. 
At baseline, participants had a median HbA1c value of 
6.4% and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

This update is based on the experience gained since 2006 
(e.g. following reports and questions raised by the pen 
users) and a continued evaluation of possible 
improvements of the Product Information. 
During this period a number of product technical complaints 
were received concerning the functionality of the pen, 
namely a blocked pen, where it is impossible to dial or 
inject a dose. 
The cause was identified that when dialling a dose and 
pushing the dose button without a needle attached to the 
pen, a mechanical pressure within the system builds, 
leading to a blockage of the pen mechanism. For this 
reason the Instructions for Use are updated to make the 
patient aware not to dial a dose or push the dose button

tissue at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain to form the 
two active metabolites, M1 and M2.  
With the availability of a new specific and quantitative 
bioanalytical method, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples 
collected in a euglycaemic clamp study were used to 
further explore the systemic exposure to unchanged insulin 
glargine and the two metabolites M1 and M2 in patients 
with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and the correlation to 
the established glucodynamic effect. In this clinical study 
insulin glargine was used as a reference at single SC doses 
of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 U/kg.  
The results of this study demonstrated that M1 was the 
principle circulating compound whereas unchanged insulin 
glargine and metabolite M2 were detected in only very few 
individual patients at few time points. The glucodynamic 
response correlated with metabolite M1 exposure. 
The CHMP agreed that this new data on insulin glargine 
metabolites was added to the SmPC.

The portfolio of the MAH contains several different insulins 
medication errors (insulin mix-up). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
with several insulin delivery devices (IDD), including the re-
usable devices (OptiPen Pro and OptiClik) and the 
device/drug combinations (pre-filled disposable pens 
OptiSet and SoloStar). 
The complexity regarding the various insulin treatments 
used in a single diabetic patient, (i.e. long acting, rapid 
acting; with the latter needing to be administered multiple 
times a day) in order to achieve optimal glycaemia control 
has created a situation wherein product differentiation 
Page 19/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
becomes increasingly important. 
Adverse events associated with insulins mix-ups, often 
result in massive overdose of the rapid-acting insulin which 
may subsequently lead to hypoglycaemia, which if left 
untreated may be life-threatening, or result in death. In 
most cases, however, the patients noticed the mistake and 
took measures to avoid hypoglycaemia, which may explain 
the large number of cases with no AE or non-serious cases.  
In order to mitigate the risk of medication errors, the MAH 
has focused its efforts up to now on educational activities 
to ensure the safe administration of their insulins. The MAH 
has also focused on differentiation strategies for insulin 
products to mitigate the potential risk of administering the 
wrong insulin to a person with diabetes. 
The product information for all the insulins from this MAH 
has been updated through the present variation to include 
warnings on the risk of insulin mix-up. 
Additionally, the MAH will incorporate changes to the 
existing insulins packaging. The aim of these changes is to 
better differentiate the different products and to increase 
readability for the pharmacist, Health Care Professional or 
patient in order to reduce potential mix-ups.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
18/02/2010

SmPC, 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
Labelling and 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Lantus remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
- Following the publication of four epidemiological studies 
on the risk of (breast) cancer with the use of insulin 
glargine in the journal Diabetologia, concerns were raised 
about the safety of insulin glargine in this respect. At this 
moment, three post-marketing pharmacoepidemiology 
studies are initiated by the MAH to further investigate the 
possible increased risk of cancer associated with the use of 
insulin glargine. These studies are planned to be finished 
within the next three years. 
Based on this, and according to Article 14.3 of Regulation 
EC(N0) 726/2004, the CHMP is of the opinion that one 
additional five-year renewal on the basis of 
Pharmacovigilance grounds is required. 
- The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to 
submit yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Lantus, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP

devices were investigated after the reported failure and the 
manufacturer's reports conclude in a suspected user's 
failure rather than a device failure. Information was added 
to section 6.6 of the SPC of Lantus solution for injection in 
a cartridge. This information was also added to the labelling 
of the outer packaging as well as clarification that the 
cartridges are to be used in conjunction with an insulin pen 
such as OptiPen and other pens suitable for Lantus 
cartridges. To section 3 of the Package Leaflet was added

clozapine and olanzapine) should be added to the list of 
substances, which may reduce the blood-glucose lowering

Introduction 
The company has applied for an increase in the batch size 
of the bulk solution of the finished product (3 ml cartridges) 
from 200 - 400 liter (initially approved) up to 1600 liter. 
For the 10 ml filling this increase in batch size has already 
been submitted and approved  (EMEA/H/C/284/II/06). In 
support of the variation the company has submitted 
validation data, a quality expert statement and an updated 
process narrative/flow chart.

vessels of 400 l capacity each. As a result the filling process 
itself remains unaffected. The effect on the filling duration 
is appropriately validated with media fills. The (in-process 
and final product quality control) results of three batches 
were within established limits and met all specifications 
approved in the MAA. A comparison with three batches 
prepared on the 400 ml scale indicate no differences 
between batches produced on the 400 ml scale and the 
1600 l scale. Therefore, the proposed variation to increase 
the batch size for the 3 ml cartridges from 400 l into 1600 l 
can be approved. This variation also fulfills follow-up 
measure 006.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF 
THE INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Olipudase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-CNS manifestations of 
ASMD in pediatric and adult patients with type A/B or type B. The epidemiology of the disease is 
summarized in the following table. 
Table 6 - Epidemiology of the acid sphingomyelinase deficiency  
Indication 
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency 
Incidence (birth 
prevalence) 
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease. The phenotype 
spectrum ranges from the severe infantile neurovisceral form (ASMD type A, historically 
known as NPD A) to the chronic visceral form (ASMD type B, NPD B), with an intermediate or 
chronic neurovisceral phenotypic presentation also being described (ASMD type A/B, 
NPD A/B). 
While ASMD type A is usually diagnosed before one year of age, the chronic forms are 
diagnosed during childhood or later, often after a patient presents with organomegaly. 
Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are prevalent in this population due to the rarity of ASMD 
and the unfamiliarity of the specific signs and symptoms of the disease. (1) 
The rarity of the disease renders accurate estimations of incidence and prevalence difficult, 
and robust epidemiological data for ASMD in various regions are lacking. In particular, natural 
history studies are most often limited to small numbers of patients, and would not allow to 
derive incidence or prevalence data (no denominator). (2)(3) Disease frequency estimates 
have been based on clinically suspected cases referred for biochemical and genetic testing. 
Population-wide screening has not been performed, but genetic screening may be performed 
in patients from certain populations with common SMPD1 pathogenic variants, such as 
patients with Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds. 
In a systematic review of birth prevalence studies, based on data from ASMD type A and B 
patients referred to biochemical testing facilities, the birth prevalence per 100 000 life-births 
was reported as 0.4 in Australia, 0.53 in the Netherlands, 0.6 in Northern Portugal, 0.33 in 
Czech Republic, and 0.25 in United Arab Emirates; (4) placing the birth incidence of ASMD at 
about 0.4 to 0.6 per 100 000 births. 
Newborn screening studies have reported an incidence of about 4 to 5 per 100 000. (5)(6) 
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency is a pan-ethnic disease; however, there is a higher birth 
prevalence of ASMD type A disease among persons with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. 
(6)(7)(8) 
In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, the only population that performs DNA-based screening, 
the carrier frequency of the 3 common pathogenic variants (L302P, R496L, fsP330) known to 
cause ASMD type A is 1 in 90 individuals, corresponding to a birth prevalence of about 
3 per 100 000. (5)(9) In non-Jewish populations, the prevalence of ASMD type A is unknown, 
the sensitivity of carrier screening has not been established, and the pathogenic variants that 
account for the disease-causing changes may differ from those in Ashkenazi Jewish 
populations. (10) 
For chronic forms of ASMD, several factors contribute to the absence of accurate estimates of 
the prevalence, including under-diagnosis related to poor access to enzyme testing, 
misdiagnosis due to the high degree of variability in presenting symptoms, and/or lack of 
knowledge about chronic forms of ASMD in the clinical community. (4)(5)(7) The Orphanet 
survey estimated the prevalence of chronic forms of ASMD type B 
as 0.4 per 100 000 individuals (and a birth prevalence of 0.25 per 100 000 for type A). (8) The 
highest frequencies of chronic forms of ASMD have been reported in individuals of Turkish,

Arabic, and North African descent, although the disorder affects many other distinct 
populations. (7) For example, estimates for the Chilean population based on the allele 
frequency of the p.(Ala359Asp) variant suggest a birth prevalence rate of about 2 cases 
per 100 000 births. (10) 
Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency is a multisystemic disorder with heterogeneous 
manifestations and represents a spectrum of disease, classified as:a (6) 
â¢  Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency type A or Infantile neurovisceral ASMD, historically 
known as NPD A, has onset during infancy with severe multiorgan manifestations and 
neurodegeneration, rapid progression and death typically by 3 years of age.  
â¢  Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency type B or Chronic visceral ASMD, historically known as 
NPD B, has a later onset and a variable progression rate and prognosis; patients may live 
into later adulthood but may be burdened with multiple morbidities, such as 
hepatosplenomegaly, progressive pulmonary dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and 
dyslipidemia reflected in the clinically significant pulmonary, liver, and cardiac diseases 
that are common contributors to premature death in these patients. 
â¢  Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency type A/B or Chronic neurovisceral ASMD, historically 
known as variant NPD B, intermediate type or NPD type A/B, in which patients survive 
early childhood but exhibit multiorgan manifestations and progressive neurological 
abnormalities. The intermediate phenotypic presentations support a position that ASMD 
represents rather a continuum of clinical subtypes, with the ASMD type A and ASMD 
type B being two ends of the spectrum. 
No publications have distinguished an occurrence ratio among the forms of ASMD or 
estimated the relative proportion of adult and pediatric patients with ASMD. Clinical 
experience has been that ASMD is often diagnosed during childhood. Of the patients who 
present symptomatically with ASMD, approximately 60% are diagnosed while in the pediatric 
age group. (11) 
There is limited information in the literature regarding pregnancy in ASMD. Personal 
observations from one physician note that women with chronic visceral ASMD type B having 
a wide range of disease manifestations including significant pulmonary disease and 
hepatosplenomegaly, appear to have normal pregnancies and healthy newborns. During 
pregnancy and the perinatal period, esophageal varices contribute to increased bleeding 
risks. (12) 
To date, only symptomatic therapy is available. This includes lifestyle and diet modifications, 
statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels, supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, vaccinations 
as appropriate for patients with underlying lung disease, vaccinations against viral hepatitis A 
and B, and blood transfusions to treat patients with acute episodes of bleeding due to 
splenomegaly and low platelet counts. 
Several attempts have been made to use cellular and solid organ transplantation as an 
indirect source of ASM replacement therapy. The experience to date with cell and organ 
transplantation has been limited. (13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24) 
Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of 
complications, improving quality of life, and addressing disease complications. 
Almost all patients with ASMD have massive hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid 
profile (cholesterol abnormalities), (6)(12)(25)(26) and most patients have interstitial lung 
disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities 
including markedly reduced platelet counts from an early age. (27)(28) Other common clinical 
manifestations include liver dysfunction, and growth delays. (6)(11)(26) 
Patients with ASMD type A have severe neurologic manifestations. ASMD type A has a rapid 
and fatal neurodegenerative course and uniformly leads to death by 3 years of age. 
 
Indication 
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency 
Patients with ASMD type B often survive into adulthood or can be diagnosed in the adulthood 
and have multi-systemic manifestations, including significant splenomegaly and 
hepatomegaly, progressive pulmonary dysfunction, musculoskeletal problems, 
thrombocytopenia, and dyslipidemia. (6) Greater than 80% of patients with ASMD type B 
have radiographic evidence of infiltrative lung disease, although some patients may not have 
overt symptoms. (27)(28) The most common symptoms include dyspnea, shortness of breath 
and bruising, fatigue, abdominal pain/discomfort, diarrhea, frequent bleedings, pulmonary 
infections, joint/limb pain, muscle weakness/cramps, as well as numbness and tingling in 
extremities. The disease interferes with functioning and activities of daily living, often leading 
to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities 
or work. 
Patients with ASMD type A/B have the disease manifestations mentioned above for ASMD 
type B, but also present with progressive neurologic manifestations resulting in a significantly 
shorter life span than those with ASMD type B. (6) 
Chronic forms of ASMD have a progressive course. (2) Clinically significant pulmonary, 
hepatic, bleeding and cardiac complications are common causes of mortality. (29) In patients 
with chronic forms of ASMD (type A/B and B), the prognosis is more variable than with ASMD 
type A. (6) In general, chronic forms of ASMD have a later onset and a variable prognosis; 
nevertheless pediatric patients with more severe manifestations of chronic ASMD are at 
particular risk for early mortality. (6) Patients with ASMD type A/B have a chronic, progressive 
disease that is considerably less severe than ASMD type A, but still carries a worse prognosis 
than ASMD type B. (30) Some patients with ASMD type B live into their 20s and possibly up 
to their 70s. A case series of 78 deceased patients with chronic forms of ASMD found a 
median age at death of 23.5 (range 0.58 to 72) years for ASMD type B 
and 8.5 (range 2 to 32) years for ASMD type A/B. (25) Many patients die before or in early 
adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Mortality data for chronic 
forms of ASMD are limited. (2)(11) In an 11-year natural history study, which included patients 
with ASMD type B and A/B, 8 patients died of causes related to ASMD. Six deaths occurred 
before age 50 with three occurring before age 20. Individuals with either severe splenomegaly 
or prior splenectomy were ten times more likely to have died during the follow-up period than 
those with smaller or intact spleens. 
Other than the genetic background, no other specificity or risk factor related to the target 
population has been identified. Therefore, it may be expected that any co-morbidities that are 
not related to the disease itself in the treated population, and not impacted by the disease 
itself, may be broadly similar to those in the general population. However, given the severity 
and variability of the disease spectrum, and the rarity of the disease itself, it is challenging to 
postulate or to establish whether or not a given comorbidity should be considered as 
independent from such a spectrum (ie, not influenced by ASMD disease itself). For example, 
antidepressant use has been reported in several patients with ASMD type B disease, but 
such data are limited due to the rarity of the disease; (31) hence it is challenging to establish 
whether or not ASMD patients have a higher risk of depression and to quantify such a risk.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART 
OF THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
Preclinical development of olipudase alfa 
A comprehensive non-clinical research program was conducted with olipudase alfa in a number of 
species and at a range of doses and dosing regimens. Animals in all studies were dosed 
intravenously, either as a bolus injection or infusion, as this is the route of administration used in 
patients (one exception was a study evaluating the subcutaneous route). These studies demonstrate 
that olipudase alfa safely and effectively metabolizes SM (32) in a mouse model of ASMD when a 
dose escalation regimen is used. The acid sphingomyelinase knock-out (ASMKO) mouse is a model 
of ASMD Type A (33) that lacks ASM activity. These ASMKO mice were used to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetic (PK), biodistribution (BD), and pharmacodynamic (PD) of olipudase alfa 
following administration of clinically relevant doses. Since the ASMKO mice accumulate SM in 
target organs such as the liver, spleen and lungs, they can be used to evaluate the PD effects of 
olipudase alfa administration on SM reduction. These animals show a significant neurological 
phenotype that resembles neuropathic ASMD but this phenotype was not assessed in the 
non-clinical studies because olipudase alfa does not cross the blood brain barrier. 
Toxicity studies were conducted in BALB/C mice, C57BL/6 mice, cluster of differentiation (CD-1) 
mice, ASMKO mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Study regimens varied from a single administration, dose escalation, to 
every other week administration for up to 6 months to support lifetime administration in ASMD 
patients. In studies conducted in BALB/c mice, C57Bl/6 mice, CD-1 mice, NZW rabbits, 
Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgous monkeys, olipudase alfa was well-tolerated. 
Doses selected in the pivotal toxicity studies (3 to 30 mg/kg) were based on available data. The high 
dose was the maximum feasible dose based on olipudase alfa concentrations for the first batches, 
and for later batches represented a 10-fold dose margin over the high dose to be used clinically. The 
highest clinical dose was selected as the low dose in the pivotal toxicity studies. 
The ASMKO mouse was considered to be the most sensitive toxicological species with acute 
toxicity findings at doses â¥10 mg/kg following a single dose in this species, whereas no toxicity 
was observed in all other species evaluated at doses up to 30 mg/kg. The lack of adverse findings at 
comparable olipudase alfa doses and exposures in the other non-clinical species evaluated 
suggested that the dose-related toxicity observed in ASMKO mice may be due to the rate and 
amount of substrate degradation. 
Adverse effects, including mortality, were observed in ASMKO mice administered olipudase alfa 
doses â¥10 mg/kg. Studies to evaluate these adverse effects were performed in ASMKO and 
C57BL/6 mice. There was a dose responsive increase in cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, 
Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor [G-CSF], IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and macrophage inflammatory 
protein [MIP]-1Î±) following a single administration of olipudase alfa at 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg, with no 
notable increases in cytokines observed at 0.3 mg/kg in the ASMKO mouse or at a single dose 
of 20 mg/kg of olipudase alfa in C57BL/6 mice. Concentrations of ceramide, sphingosine, and 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (catabolites of the accumulated SM) were increased following high doses 
of olipudase alfa (â¥10 mg/kg) in the ASMKO mouse, similar to that seen for cytokines. 
 
These results suggested that a dose escalation regimen may be necessary to reduce the toxic 
response at higher olipudase alfa doses. 
To test the hypothesis that the rapid accumulation of SM catabolites are responsible for the toxicity 
observed in the ASMKO mice, and upon request of Health Authorities to explore the mechanism of 
toxicity, repeat-dose studies were conducted to determine if a more gradual reduction in SM 
through dose escalation regimens could reduce the toxicity observed with a single high dose of 
olipudase alfa. When ASMKO mice received 4 IV doses of 3 mg/kg administered every other day, 
followed by a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg, 72 hours later, no mortality was observed and other 
toxicity findings were reduced in severity. Additionally, increases in cytokine and ceramide 
concentrations in the serum were reduced with this dose escalation regimen. Results from this study 
suggested that increased plasma concentrations of both total and C16-ceramide correlated with 
increased lethality and poor clinical outcome. When olipudase alfa (3 mg/kg) was administered 
once a week to ASMKO mice in a dose escalation regimen, instead of every other day, prior to a 
bolus dose of 20 mg/kg, olipudase alfa was also well-tolerated. Furthermore, in a study where 
ASMKO mice were administered olipudase alfa at 3 mg/kg every other day for 4 doses followed by 
doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg every other week for 13 weeks (7 total doses), olipudase alfa was 
well-tolerated with an no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg. 
One study was performed to evaluate the potential PD drug interaction of two functional inhibitors 
of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs). Functional inhibitors of ASM are a large group of cationic 
amphiphilic molecules that may disrupt the interaction of ASM with the lysosomal membrane. (34) 
Most FIASMAs have been identified by in silico analysis and substantial in vitro or in vivo data is 
lacking. Two common antidepressant drugs (citalopram and fluoxetine) with variable levels of 
predicted inhibitory activity against ASM were co-administered with olipudase alfa to evaluate their 
impact on PD response. Fluoxetine and citalopram were selected because they belong to the same 
class of drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and demonstrated different levels of 
inhibitory activity in vitro. Fluoxetine is predicted to be the more potent inhibitor with 
approximately 13% residual ASM activity remaining in an in vitro inhibitor assay whereas 
incubation with citalopram resulted in approximately 80% residual ASM activity. (35) The effect of 
fluoxetine and citalopram on SM reduction following a single administration of 1 mg/kg olipudase 
alfa was then evaluated in the spleen and liver of ASMKO mice. Fluoxetine did not impact 
olipudase alfa-mediated SM reduction in the liver and spleen despite previous in vitro data 
demonstrating robust ASM inhibition. Co-administration of citalopram did not impact olipudase 
alfa-mediated SM clearance in the liver. However, spleen SM levels were not significantly reduced 
compared to vehicle controls following co-administration of citalopram and olipudase alfa. These 
levels were not significantly different from the SM content in spleen from animals administered 
olipudase alfa alone, suggesting that this result may reflect the variability in PD effect at this dose 
rather than a true effect of citalopram inhibition. The inhibitor levels were in the lower end of the 
therapeutic range for both citalopram and fluoxetine, limiting the interpretation of these results. The 
data from this study suggest that fluoxetine is not a FIASMA in vivo, but a conclusion cannot be 
made regarding the inhibitory activity of citalopram. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and NZW rabbits at 
doses up to 30 mg/kg. No olipudase alfa-related adverse effects were observed at the highest dose 
of olipudase alfa evaluated, 30 mg/kg, in a male and female fertility study in CD-1 mice, in an 
embryo-foetal toxicity study in NZW rabbits, or in a pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study in 
CD-1 mice. An increased incidence of exencephaly was observed when pregnant mice were treated 
 
daily with olipudase alfa at exposure levels less than the human exposure at the recommended 
maintenance therapeutic dose and frequency. This incidence was slightly higher than historical 
control data. The relevance of this observation for humans is unknown. The daily IV administration 
of olipudase alfa to pregnant rabbits did not result in foetal malformations or variations at exposures 
significantly exceeding the human exposure at the recommended maintenance therapeutic dose and 
frequency. The developmental NOAELs in mice and rabbits are 3 and 30 mg/kg/day. 
No juvenile toxicity studies were conducted. Juvenile toxicity studies in non-diseased animals 
would not provide information that is not already available in the described toxicity program. The 
ASMKO mouse is the most sensitive species, but unfortunately cannot be used for juvenile toxicity 
studies due to reproductive and neurological deficiencies in this mouse model. ASMKO mice have 
decreased litters, decreased numbers of pups, decreased sperm motility and sperm morphology 
issues, as well as decreased body size and increased cholesterol concentrations. ASMKO mice 
develop ataxia and neurological deficiencies by 2 to 4 months of age and die 
between 6 and 8 months of age. As olipudase alfa does not cross the blood-brain barrier, both 
treated and control groups would show similar background neurobehavioral abnormalities. These 
abnormalities, combined with resulting lethargy and ultimately death, renders distinguishing the 
ASMKO phenotype from potential toxicity difficult; neurobehavioral evaluations could not be 
adequately conducted. 
Single dose BD studies were also conducted in CD-1 mice to evaluate the distribution of olipudase 
alfa to the milk of lactating mice and to the fetus of pregnant mice. Olipudase alfa was not detected 
in fetuses from pregnant CD-1 mice administered a single dose of 3 mg/kg on E15. However, 
significant levels of olipudase alfa were measured in the milk of lactating mice 2 days following 
administration of 3 mg/kg. 
The key non-clinical findings are presented in the following table:

Toxicity 
Toxicity 
â¢  Toxicity studies conducted in ASMKO mice, 
CD-1 mice, BALB/c mice, C57Bl/6 mice, 
Sprague-Dawley rats, NZW rabbits, beagle dogs, and 
cynomolgus monkeys, support the safety of olipudase 
alfa for clinical administration to ASMD patients at 
doses up to 3 mg/kg in conjunction with a dose 
escalation dose regimen. 
â¢  Adverse effects, including mortality, were observed in 
ASMKO mice administered olipudase alfa 
doses â¥10 mg/kg. Studies to evaluate these adverse 
effects were performed in ASMKO and C57BL/6 mice. 
Microscopic findings following a single dose included 
ballooning degeneration (â¥1 mg/kg) and inflammatory 
foci noted in the liver (â¥0.1 mg/kg) as well as adrenal 
gland congestion/hemorrhage (â¥1 mg/kg). There was 
a dose-responsive increase in cytokines (IL6, G-CSF, 
IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and MIP-1Î±) following a single 
administration of olipudase alfa at 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg, 
with no notable increases in cytokines observed at 
â¢  Toxicity studies conducted in ASMKO mice, CD-1 mice, 
BALB/c mice, C57Bl/6 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, NZW 
rabbits, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys, support 
the safety of olipudase alfa for clinical administration to 
ASMD patients at doses up to 3 mg/kg in conjunction with 
a dose escalation dose regimen. This dose escalation 
regimen has been implemented in all clinical studies 
starting with the Phase 1b trial (multiple ascending dose) 
and is part of the label. 
â¢  Transient elevations in transaminases during dose 
escalation have been observed in clinical trials, and do not 
raise a concern; no other findings indicating hepatoxicity 
were observed.  
â¢  Infusion associated reactions of systemic hypersensitivity 
(a majority of which were mild/moderate in intensity) 
including anaphylactic reactions, antibody mediated 
hypersensitivity reactions were seen in clinical trials. 
Immunogenicity is considered as an important identified 
risk (see [Part II SVII]).  
 
Key Safety Findings  
Relevance to human usage 
0.3 mg/kg in the ASMKO mouse or at a single dose of 
20 mg/kg of olipudase alfa in C57BL/6 mice. 
Concentrations of ceramide, sphingosine, and 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (catabolites of the 
accumulated SM) were increased following high doses 
of olipudase alfa (â¥10 mg/kg) in the ASMKO mouse, 
similar to that seen for cytokines. However, the toxicity 
can be ameliorated if a dose escalation dosing 
regimen is employed. Intravenous olipudase alfa at 
doses of 3 mg/kg administered to ASMKO mice every 
other day for four doses followed by doses of 3, 10, or 
30 mg/kg every other week for 13 weeks (7 total 
doses) was well-tolerated. No increases in 
transaminases or adverse microscopic changes in the 
liver were observed. 
â¢  Hypersensitivity reactions to olipudase alfa, a human 
protein, were sometimes observed, most notably in 
mice and rats with repeated administrations, which 
necessitated pre-treatment/post-treatment with DPH; 
IP administration. 
â¢  An increased incidence of exencephaly was observed 
when pregnant mice were treated daily with olipudase 
alfa intravenously at exposure less than the human 
exposure at the recommended maintenance 
therapeutic dose and frequency. This incidence was 
slightly higher than historical control data. The daily IV 
administration of olipudase alfa to pregnant rabbits did 
not result in foetal malformations or variations at 
exposures significantly exceeding the human exposure 
at the recommended maintenance therapeutic dose 
and frequency. 
â¢  No serious and/or severe APRs have been observed in 
clinical trials. 
â¢  Studies with olipudase alfa have not been performed in 
pregnant women. As with any investigational drug product, 
there may be a risk of congenital anomalies. The relevance 
of this observation in mice for humans is unknown. Results 
from animal studies are not always predictive with respect 
to effects on pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, 
parturition, and postnatal development. Therefore, the 
potential reproductive toxicity and risks for humans are 
unknown. 
â¢  As studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, 
âfoetal toxicityâ is considered an important potential risk in 
the RMP (see [Part II SVII]).

Safety pharmacology  
Safety pharmacology  
â¢  A GLP safety pharmacology study was conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys and cardiovascular, respiratory, 
and CNS evaluations performed as part of the GLP 
single dose study of olipudase alfa in beagle dogs. 
Endpoints encompassed the core battery as defined in 
the ICH S7A and S7B guidelines. The results indicated 
that there were no test article-related changes in 
neurobehavioral or ECG parameters, heart rate, body 
temperature, activity or respiratory rate following 
administration at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg IV.

approximately 60 minutes post-dose, which was 
accompanied by a decrease in motor activity and 
followed by a slow decline in blood pressure beginning 
approximately 130 to 140 minutes post-dose. In 
addition, cardiac function (hemodynamic response, 
heart rate, blood pressure, and activity) was measured 
 
Key Safety Findings  
Relevance to human usage 
following two doses of olipudase alfa 
at 3 and 10 mg/kg and, while a slight decline in heart 
rate was noted following the second olipudase alfa 
administration, the heart rate did not drop 
below 550 beats per minute. These data suggest that 
a controlled release of SM catabolites following 
repeated low dose administration of olipudase alfa 
would not negatively impact cardiac function. 
â¢  No adverse effects on cardiac function have been 
observed in ASMKO mice when olipudase alfa was 
administered via a dose escalation regimen.

Overall Clinical trial exposure for the 5 olipudase alfa studies  
Eleven patients were treated in the single-dose Phase 1a trial (SPHINGO00605). The phase 1b trial 
DFI13412 enrolled 5 patients and 1 patient who had not been exposed to olipudase alfa (4 of whom 
had already participated in the phase 1a trial). Therefore, there were 12 adult patients who were 
exposed to olipudase alfa in completed trials. All 5 patients who completed DFI13412 were rolled 
over to the ongoing long-term study LTS13632. 
Ongoing study DFI12712 ASCEND enrolled 36 patients, including one who was previously 
exposed to olipudase alfa in SPHINGO00605. One patient who had not previously received 
olipudase alfa was randomized to placebo and discontinued from the study without ever receiving 
olipudase alfa. Therefore, 34 patients were newly exposed to olipudase alfa in the ongoing 
DFI12712 study. 
Overall, 46 adult patients have been exposed to olipudase alfa in both completed and ongoing 
studies. 
There were 20 pediatric patients enrolled in the DFI13803 study, 4 adolescents (12 to <18 years of 
age), 9 children (6 to <12 years of age), and 7 infants/early children (birth to <6 years of age). All 
patients completed the trial and are now enrolled in the ongoing long-term study LTS13632. 
Therefore, a total of 66 patients (46 adult and 20 pediatric) have been exposed to olipudase alfa. 
Six (6) adults from phase 1a study (single dose study) did not enroll into phase 1b or DFI12712 
study. Thus, following tables summarize the exposure for all olipudase alfa exposed patients in 
multiple dose studies (DFI13412, DFI12712, DFI13803 and LTS13632) including 40 adults (5 from 
phase 1b and 35 from DFI12721) and 20 pediatric patients. 
 
Table 10 shows duration of exposure. Overall, sixty patients had a median of 3.11 years (range 0.4 to 7.8) of exposure to olipudase alfa. Almost all 
patients (98.3%) received â¥1 year of olipudase alfa treatment, 88.3% received â¥2 years of treatment, and 51.7% received â¥3 years of treatment. 
The treatment exposure was larger in adult patients than pediatric patients.

For summary of exposure by dose in Table 12, since each study has a dose escalation phase, each patient was summarized into multiple dose 
groups. 
Median duration of exposure to olipudase alfa was low across infusion doses between 0.03 to 2.0 mg/kg (range 0 to 3.1), the doses administered 
during dose escalation, compared to a median of 2.68 years (range 0.1 to 7.6) for the targeted maintenance dose 3.0 mg/kg dose.

Patients with organ transplants 
have maintenance medications 
and comorbidities that would 
confound the evaluation of the 
safety profile of olipudase alfa. 
Patients with serious 
inter-current illnesses were 
excluded from the study due to 
the possibility that it may 
significantly interfere with study 
compliance including all 
prescribed evaluations and 
follow-up activity, and 
measurement of safety 
(bleeding) and efficacy 
endpoints (improved platelet 
count). 
Lactating women

information? 
Patient with a total splenectomy. 
The patient is scheduled during 
the study for in-patient 
hospitalization including elective 
surgery and excluding the liver 
biopsies required per protocol 
(Specific to DFI13803 and 
DFI12712). 
Concomitant ingestion of several 
classes of medications (eg, 
fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, 
tricyclic antidepressants [eg, 
imipramine, or desipramine], 
cationic amphiphilic antihistamines 
[eg, loratadine, desloratadine, 
astemizole, ebastine and 
clemastine]). 
No 
Reduction in spleen size was a 
key efficacy endpoint in 
previous clinical studies, which 
could not be evaluated in 
splenectomized patients. 
Elective surgeries may interfere 
with the patientâs compliance 
with study visit schedule. 
No 
No 
Based on the available 
publications of in vitro and in 
silico data, ASM activity may be 
decreased in patients due to 
concomitant ingestion of certain 
selected cationic amphiphilic 
drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, 
SSRIs, and antihistamines). 
(34) Efficacy assessments 
could be impaired by these 
medications. 
Olipudase alfa exposure 
in patients who have had 
a splenectomy does not 
constitute an additional 
safety concern. 
Excluded for study

Clinical development program not enriched for specific populations.  
No drug interaction studies have been performed. Patients using 
these medications were not included in the clinical development 
program. 
ASMD: Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency; IND: Investigational New Drug. 
Pregnant women  
There are no data from the use of olipudase alfa in pregnant women. In study DFI12712, there was 
one pregnancy in a partner of a patient exposed to olipudase alfa. The partner gave birth to a 
 at week 38 of gestation by c-section and no congenital anomaly was 
child 
reported. The child was breastfeeding soon after birth with no neonatal illness, need for 
resuscitation or corrective or intensive care treatment.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of exencephaly was 
observed in a single species (mice) at exposure less than the human exposure at the recommended 
maintenance therapeutic dose and frequency; the relevance of this observation for humans is 
unknown. It is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of child bearing potential 
(WOCBP) not using effective contraception, unless the potential benefits to the mother outweigh 
the potential risks, including those to the foetus (see [Module part II SII] Table 7). 
Pregnant women are part of the target population. Therefore, âfoetal toxicityâ is considered as 
important potential risk (see Section SVII.1.1). 
Lactating women 
There are no data available concerning the use of olipudase alfa in lactating women.  
Lactating women are part of the target population. Therefore, the use of olipudase alfa in lactating 
women is considered as missing information (see Section SVII.1.1). 
Patients with relevant comorbidities 
Hepatic cirrhosis is a known complication of ASMD. Cirrhosis was initially an exclusion criterion 
in DFI1712 ASCEND. The protocol was subsequently amended to allow the inclusion of ASMD 
patients with cirrhosis. There have been 3 patients with stage 3 cirrhosis enrolled in the clinical 
development program. Although data are limited, the tolerability of olipudase alfa in patient with 
cirrhosis is consistent with the entire ASMD adult population. 
Populations with relevant different ethnic origin and different race 
To date, there is no information to suggest that patients with any specific racial or ethnic origins are 
differentially affected by olipudase alfa. 
 
 
Patient with ASMD Type A 
Olipudase alfa does not cross the blood brain barrier and is not expected to treat the CNS 
manifestations of the disease. 
Patient taking several classes of medications 
Based on the available publications of in vitro and in silico data, ASM activity may be decreased in 
patients due to concomitant ingestion of certain classes of medications with cationic amphiphilic 
structures including antihistamines and antidepressants. (34)(35) The clinical relevance of this 
theoretical interaction is unknown. 
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) are routinely monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance activity. 
It is not considered relevant for the RMP (see Section SVII.1.1).

POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE  
The marketing authorization holder (MAH) is currently utilizing the Margin 
Consolidated (MARCO) application for reporting of sales data from postmarketing experience and 
has been doing so since December 2019.  
As World Health Organization (WHO) defined daily dose (DDD) for parenteral formulation is not 
available, the patient exposure in patient years (PYs) could not be estimated for infusion powder, 
injection liquid (solution)1 and injection. 
Sales from the cumulative experience is available from MARCO for the period from 01 May 2020 
through 30 September 2022.  
A total of 83 vials of infusion powder, 2914 vials of injection liquid (solution) and 2202 vials of 
injection powder were sold worldwide during the cumulative period. 
Detailed usage data are not available therefore presentation of sales data by age, sex, and indication

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVI: ADDITIONAL EU 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
SVI.1 
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES  
The properties of olipudase alfa do not indicate a potential for misuse for illegal purposes. 
A drug abuse liability assessment (DALA) study was not performed with olipudase alfa as the 
protein has no ability to cross the blood-brain barrier with negligible exposure in the brain, and has 
shown no propensity for eliciting any neurological effects in toxicology studies. 
The company medical query (CMQ) related to drug abuse and associated liabilities was used to 
identify relevant treatment emergent adverse event (TEAEs). During the double-blind PAP of 
DFI12712, preferred terms (PT) related to drug abuse and associated liabilities were reported more 
frequently in the placebo group, compared to the olipudase alfa treatment group and included 
anxiety (16.7% and 0%, respectively) and dizziness (11.1% and 0%). The PT of feeling abnormal 
was reported by 1 (5.6%) patient in the olipudase alfa group. 
The most frequently observed PTs in the overall population (>20% of patients) were headache, 
pyrexia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia, fatigue, dizziness and rhinorrhoea. 
The potential for misuse of olipudase alfa for illegal purposes is considered low as this product has 
not been shown to have known pharmacological addictive effects, such as intentional overdose, 
abuse, or illegal use. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities thus, are considered sufficient to monitor a potential for 
misuse for illegal purposes related to olipudase alfa. 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVII: IDENTIFIED AND 
POTENTIAL RISKS   
SVII.1 
IDENTIFICATION OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE INITIAL RMP SUBMISSION  
The following safety topics were assessed as either not relevant to olipudase alfa RMP based on the 
currently available clinical evidence or not benefiting from additional pharmacovigilance or 
additional risk minimization activities. 
The safety topics, evaluated in Section SVII.1.1 as not important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP, are the following:  
â¢  Lack of efficacy due to neutralizing antidrug antibody (ADA) 
â¢  Reduced efficacy of olipudase alfa due to ASM inhibition in context of PD DDI 
â¢  Potential harm from overdose 
â¢  Potential for transmission of infectious agents 
â¢  Potential for off-label use 
â¢  Effect on fertility 
â¢  Use in pediatric patients 
The following safety topics were considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the initial RMP. They are discussed in Section SVII.1.2: 
Important identified risk: 
â¢ 
Immunogenicity: 
- 
Infusion associated reactions (IARs), 
-  Systemic hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions, 
-  Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) mediated hypersensitivity reactions, 
Important potential risks: 
â¢  Medication errors in home infusion setting 
â¢  Foetal toxicity 
Missing information: 
â¢  Use in lactating women  
â¢  Long-term safety (beyond 2 years) 
 
SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP  
Reason(s) for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Risks known to be associated with other therapeutic ERTs, but assessed as not relevant to 
olipudase alfa and its benefit-risk balance, based on the currently available evidence or which 
would not benefit from additional risk minimization activities or from further evaluation: 
â¢  Lack of efficacy due to Neutralizing antibodies: 
There has been no evidence throughout the clinical development program for olipudase alfa that 
detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies (NAb) is associated with lack of efficacy. 
Neutralizing antibodies are a subset of binding ADAs that bind to the drug and inhibit its 
pharmacological function by preventing target binding and biologic activity of the drug. 
Patients were initially screened for development of ADA and confirmed ADA positive samples 
were further evaluated for the presence of NAb that could inhibit enzymatic activity or uptake into 
cells. (36) Overall, 9 of 60 patients (15%) developed NAb that inhibited olipudase alfa catalytic 
activity. Three (3) patients had a persistent response that was intermittent, and 6 patients had a 
transient response which was NAb-positive at only one timepoint that reverted to NAb-negative. 
There were no patients who developed NAb that inhibited cellular uptake. Overall, the development 
of NAb, did not have a meaningful effect on PK, PD (plasma lyso-sphingomyelin), safety and 
efficacy parameters in these patients including the 3 patients with persistent NAb. 
Given the totality of the data, âLack of efficacy due to NAbâ is not considered as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. Routine pharmacovigilance should suffice to address and monitor 
potential lack of efficacy. 
Other reasons for considering the risks not important for inclusion in the RMP: 
â¢  Lack of efficacy due to acid sphingomyelinase inhibition in context of 
pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction 
Based on the available publications of in vitro and in silico data, ASM activity may be decreased in 
patients due to concomitant use of FIASMAs. Functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase are a 
large group of cationic amphiphilic molecules that may disrupt ASM interaction with the lysosomal 
membrane and are found in certain classes of medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and 
some anti-histamines. The clinical relevance of this theoretical functional inhibition is not known. 
A non-clinical PD drug interaction study (Study 19-01094) was conducted in ASMKO mice that 
suggested that fluoxetine and citalopram may not affect SM clearance following a single 
administration of 1 mg/kg olipudase alfa. Co-administration of olipudase alfa with 
fluoxetine (300 Âµg/day) or citalopram (192 Âµg/day) had no effect on olipudase alfa-mediated SM 
reduction in the liver and spleen, but the circulating levels of fluoxetine and citalopram were in the 
lower end of the therapeutic window for each drug. The possibility of reduced efficacy of olipudase 
alfa due to ASM inhibition in the context of PD DDI cannot be excluded. 
 
These concomitant medications were prohibited during the clinical development program; thus, 
there are no data to confirm the findings from the study in ASKMO mice, nor have any DDIs been 
reported. The clinical relevance of this DDI risk with FIASMAs remains unclear but is likely low. 
Therefore, if patients need to use these concomitant medications, the benefit-risk profile would 
remain favorable considering the severity of the disease and the limited treatments available. 
The risk is not considered as an important risk for the RMP.  
â¢  Potential harm from overdose: 
No instance of asymptomatic or symptomatic overdose has been observed in clinical studies during 
the dose escalation or the maintenance periods. Highest dose tested in preclinical studies was a 
NOAEL. Dose escalation regimen are described in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
for adult and pediatric patients. 
â¢  Potential for transmission of infectious agents: 
The potential for transmission of an infectious agent by olipudase alfa is considered very low based 
upon the following: 
-  No human-derived material is used during the manufacturing process; 
-  Animal derived material used during the manufacturing process complies with the 
current Committee for Human Medicinal Products, Note for Guidance, entitled 
âMinimizing the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathic Agents via 
Human and Veterinary Medicinal Productsâ; 
-  Animal serum used during the manufacturing process is irradiated to mitigate the risk of 
adventitious virus contamination; 
-  There is robust virus reducing capacity during the product purification process; total 
reduction factors vary from â¥5.7 log to â¥15.9 log for the four-model virus tested. The 
process includes a 20 nm filter which is robust and completely removed all model 
viruses tested, including demonstrated clearance of â¥5.8 log of mouse minute virus (the 
smaller virus tested); 
-  Characterization testing has confirmed the absence of infectious adventitious and 
endogenous agents in the Master Cell Bank, Working Cell Bank, and End of Production 
cells; 
- 
In the event of suspected or confirmed transmission of infectious agents or other 
contamination, pharmacovigilance will perform an assessment of the risk to patient 
safety. 
Other concerns not considered important for inclusion in the RMP: 
â¢  Effect on fertility: 
Administration of olipudase alfa had no effects on mating and fertility of the male or female mice 
or litter parameters of female mice and rabbits evaluated at mid-gestation (NOAELs 
were 30 mg/kg, highest dose evaluated). 
 
â¢  Potential for off-label use: 
According to current knowledge, it is unlikely that this drug will be prescribed for any other 
indication than ASMD. 
â¢  Use in pediatric patients: 
The safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa was studied in pediatric population (patients were eligible 
from birth to <18 years) as part of the target population. With the exception of the higher 
frequency of treatment emergent infusion associated reactions in pediatric patients, which were 
manageable and did not preclude continuation of treatment, the safety and efficacy profile of 
treatment with olipudase alfa in pediatric patients was found to be consistent with that seen in 
adults. 
SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP

Immunogenicity: Infusion associated reactions (IARs), systemic hypersensitivity including 
anaphylactic reactions, ADA mediated hypersensitivity reactions 
Scientific evidence that 
has led to the inclusion 
Clinical trial experience:  
â¢  Infusion associated reactions have been observed in all studies in the olipudase alfa 
clinical development program; 58.3% of patients in the overall safety population had at 
least one protocol defined infusion associated reaction. 
â¢  Systemic hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions; antibody-mediated 
hypersensitivity reactions with positive IgG and/or IgE ADA have been observed in the 
clinical program (phase 1/2 trial DFI13803 in pediatric patients, repeat-dose 1b trial 
DFI13412 in adult patients).  
â¢  One pediatric patient had one event of anaphylaxis and another pediatric patient had three 
events of hypersensitivity. Both pediatric patients were ADA positive, however, both 
patients recovered and continued in the study including the long-term extension. 
â¢  The clinical findings support that olipudase alfa has a low immunogenicity risk relative to 
ADA impact on clinical outcomes. A higher incidence of treatment emergent IARs and 
hypersensitivity was seen in patients who developed treatment emergent ADA versus 
those who did not; however, the IARs were manageable and did not preclude continuation 
of treatment.

Other:  
One pediatric patient, 
IND, extrinsic to the clinical development program. This patient experienced two anaphylactic 
reactions (see 5.3.5.4 Investigator initiated emergency IND report). 
Class effects: 
The potential of developing an IAR is reported in the product information of some marketed 
ERTs, including FABRAZYMEÂ®, MYOZYMEÂ®, CEREZYMEÂ®, NAGLAZYMEÂ®. 
Scientific literature: 
Olipudase alfa contains trace amounts of polysorbate 80 (<0.02% by weight). 
Hypersensitivity reactions (generalized pruritus, erythema, and orofacial angioedema) to 
polysorbate have been reported rarely in the literature with polysorbate 80 concentrations as 
low as 0.0015%. (37) 
 
Immunogenicity: Infusion associated reactions (IARs), systemic hypersensitivity including 
anaphylactic reactions, ADA mediated hypersensitivity reactions 
Risk-benefit impact 
Although IARs, severe hypersensitivity reactions and ADA mediated hypersensitivity 
reactions may occur with olipudase alfa, the benefit-risk profile of olipudase alfa remains 
favorable. The clinical findings support that olipudase alfa has a low immunogenicity risk 
relative to ADA impact on clinical outcomes.

Medication errors in home infusion setting 
Scientific evidence that 
has led to the inclusion 
There is potential for human error with respect to administration of the product (eg, dose 
calculation, reconstitution, underdose/overdose, etc.) in the home infusion setting. 
Potential medication error is listed as an important potential risk in the RMP of other 
marketed ERTs for which home infusion setting is possible.  
Clinical trial experience:  
No medication errors have been identified in home infusion setting by the time of data cutoff. 
Risk-benefit impact 
Although the possibility of medication errors cannot be excluded, home infusion is considered 
safe and feasible for patients once selected by the prescribing/treating physician and the 
benefit-risk profile of olipudase alfa is expected to remain favorable in this setting.

Foetal toxicity 
Scientific evidence that 
has led to the inclusion 
Preclinical data:  
In studies in animals, reproductive toxicity was observed. 
An increased incidence of exencephaly was observed when pregnant mice were treated daily 
with olipudase alfa intravenously at exposures levels comparable to the human exposure at 
the recommended maintenance therapeutic dose and frequency. This incidence was slightly 
higher than historical control data. The relevance of this observation for humans is unknown. 
The daily IV administration of olipudase alfa to pregnant rabbits did not result in foetal 
malformations or variations at exposures significantly exceeding the human exposure at the 
recommended maintenance therapeutic dose and frequency. 
Risk-benefit impact 
Patients with ASMD are treated throughout their lifespan and, therefore, may include 
WOCBP. Additional data are needed to characterize the safety profile in this population. 
ASMD: Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency; IV: Intravenous; WOCBP: Women of Childbearing Potential.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency patients are treated throughout their lifespan and, 
therefore, may include lactating women. Non-clinical data do not suggest adverse effects on 
growth and development of nursing pups. 
 
Use in lactating women 
Risk-benefit impact 
Olipudase alfa should be used during lactation only if the potential benefits to the mother 
outweigh the potential risks for the newborn. The benefit-risk profile of olipudase alfa is 
expected to remain favorable in this population.

The benefit-risk profile of olipudase alfa is expected to remain favorable in ASMD patients 
exposed to olipudase alfa for more than 2 years. 
Long-term use safety data beyond 2 years in ASMD patients will be collected through the 
ongoing studies LTS13632 in adults and pediatric patients and DFI12712 ASCEND ETP in 
adult patients. Patients currently enrolled in the clinical studies are expected to continue 
treatment with commercial product and will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.

Characterization of the risk  Details of the events related to the sub-types and their impact on patientâs treatment and 
outcome are presented below: 
Frequency: 
In the clinical studies  
â¢  Infusion associated reactions have been observed in all studies in the olipudase alfa 
clinical development program; 58.3% of patients in the overall safety population had at 
least one protocol defined IAR. 
â¢  One pediatric patient (5.0%, 1/20 patients) experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction 
in the clinical trial program and was determined to have IgG and IgE antiolipudase 
alfa antibodies. There were two pediatric patients (10.0%) who were positive for IgG 
antiolipudase alfa antibodies and experienced serious hypersensitivity reactions 
(urticaria, rash, and hypersensitivity). All three patientsâ events occurred within 72 hours 
of infusion. One patient with type A ASMD experienced two severe 
allergic/anaphylactic-like reactions during infusion that responded well to therapy 
(eIND). 
â¢  There were no anaphylactic reactions reported in adult patients. 
Severity and nature of risk: 
Infusion associated reactions: 
â¢  Overall, 30 (50.0%) patients experienced a total of 302 mild events, 17 (28.3%) patients 
experienced a moderate event and 1 (1.7%) patient experienced a severe event of IAR. 
â¢  Similar percentages of pediatric patients and adult patients had IARs (65.0% 
and 55.0%, respectively). Among the most frequently reported IARs, the EAIR was 
higher in pediatric than adult patients for: urticaria (11.35 versus 4.21 patients 
per 100 PY); pyrexia (14.85 versus 3.37); and vomiting (10.38 versus 2.35). The EAIR 
was higher in adult patients than pediatric patients for headache 
(9.72 versus 6.00 patients per 100 PY) and was similar in adult and pediatric patients 
for nausea (5.61 and 6.02, respectively). 
Systemic hypersensitivity: 
â¢  In one patient of the 3 pediatric patients who experienced systemic hypersensitivity, the 
events were severe ie, anaphylactic reaction (1 patient 1 event). Specifically, in study 
DFI13803, one serious case of anaphylactic reaction 
 occurred at 
week 12 (16-Jul-2019) during infusion (scheduled dose 0.6 mg/kg). This patient was 
successfully desensitized using a tailored regimen. All three pediatric patients have 
continued treatment and are enrolled in LTS13632. 
Anti-drug antibody mediated hypersensitivity reactions: 
â¢  Overall, 29 of 60 (48.3%) patients in the clinical studies developed treatment-emergent 
ADA; however, the ADA titers were predominantly â¤400 (median ADA titer was 100), 
 
 
 
Important identified 
Risk 
Immunogenicity: Infusion associated reactions (IARs), systemic 
hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions, ADA mediated 
hypersensitivity reactions 
which are considered as low response. Only 5 patients, 3 pediatric and 2 adults, 
developed intermediate titers that ranged from 800 to 3200. Some of the TEAEs 
associated with ADA also resemble to IARs and were generally mild-to-moderate and 
clinically manageable. One pediatric patient, who experienced anaphylaxis (described 
above), developed IgE ADA and had a peak IgG ADA titer of 1600, the highest titer in 
the pediatric olipudase alfa safety set. 
â¢  Overall, there was a higher percentage of patients with treatment emergent IARs in 
patients who developed treatment emergent ADA versus those who did 
not (75.9% versus 41.9%). The treatment emergent IARs with a higher incidence by PT 
in adult or pediatric patients who developed treatment emergent ADA versus those who 
did not, respectively, were: 
-  Adult patients: Urticaria (31.3% versus 0%), Pruritus (18.8% versus 0%) 
-  Pediatric patients: Urticaria (53.8% versus 0%), Pyrexia (46.2% versus 28.6%), 
Erythema (15.4% versus 0%), Abdominal pain (15.4% versus 0%). 
Seriousness and outcome:  
Three pediatric patients (2 in Study DFI13803 Peds and 1 in Study LTS13632) 
experienced protocol-defined IARs/systemic hypersensitivity that were SAEs. No event 
resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. No serious IARs were reported in study 
DFI12712. 
All patients were found to be positive for IgG ADA, with 2 of 3 patients having peak ADA 
titers in the intermediate range (800-1600), which modestly decreased over time, 
and 1 patient was low titer (200). In addition, 1 patient was positive for IgE ADA. 
All three patients experiencing a serious IAR/systemic hypersensitivity event recovered; 
resumed olipudase alfa treatment; and are currently enrolled in LTS13632.  
Background incidence/prevalence: 
Immunogenicity is specific to the biologic product and does not occur in untreated patients 
with ASMD. 
Systemic hypersensitivity and IARs: 
â¢  Patients with previous hypersensitivity/allergy to olipudase alfa and its excipients. 
â¢  Available clinical data suggest children may have greater predisposition, compared to 
adults. 
Additional risk characterization has not been fully established. 
Anti-drug antibody mediated hypersensitivity reactions: 
The immunologic response to olipudase alfa in adult versus pediatric ASMD patients was 
relatively similar. Adults had a median ADA peak titer of 50 (range 50-3200) compared to 
pediatric patients with a median ADA peak titer of 200 (range 50-1600). 
Labelling statements (See Section V.1) and educational materials (see Section V.2) 
â¢  To remind the prescribing/treating physician with appropriate patient selection for home 
infusion, the HCPs with monitoring of IARs and hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis during and 
post infusion, importance of dose escalation, management of IARs and

Patients with ASMD are treated throughout their lifespan. 
The benefit-risk profile of olipudase alfa is expected to remain favorable in type A/B and 
type B ASMD patients already exposed to olipudase alfa for more than 2 years. 
Therapeutic proteins have the potential to induce immunogenicity and generate ADA. 
However, not all ADA have clinical consequences. The majority of patients developed a low 
ADA response (ADA titer â¤400). The immunologic response to olipudase alfa in adult 
versus pediatric ASMD patients was relatively similar. In general, ADA titers tended to 
slowly decrease over time, but of note, did not increase with repeated exposure to drug. 
Overall, the median peak ADA titer since the first dose of olipudase alfa was 200 for 
pediatric patients and decreased to 100 by the end of the study. In adult patients, the 
median peak ADA titer was 75 and decreased to 50. In addition, 6.7% of patients tolerized 
or reverted to become ADA-negative by the end of the study. These data support that 
olipudase alfa has a low immunogenicity risk relative to ADA impact on clinical outcomes.

Long-term safety (beyond 2 years) 
Long-term use safety data beyond 2 years in ASMD patients will be collected through the

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN 
(INCLUDING POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
III.1 
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
The safety profile of olipudase alfa will be continuously monitored from product launch, using 
following routine pharmacovigilance activities: 
â¢  Routine pharmacovigilance practices allowing a comprehensive, continuous and global 
overview of postmarketing safety profile of olipudase alfa and signal detection. 
â¢  Periodic assessment in periodic safety update reports (PSURs)/periodic benefit-risk 
evaluation report (PBRER) for spontaneous reports related to identified and potential risks. 
â¢  Continued analysis of safety in clinical trials. 
The ongoing clinical trial program (DFI12712 and LTS13632) includes safety assessment with 
collection of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) which are defined as AEs, serious or 
nonserious, that need to be monitored, documented and managed in a pre-specified manner. These 
AESIs include pregnancy, symptomatic overdose, laboratory values meeting pre-specified criteria 
(dose limiting toxicities based on transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels and symptoms), 
Infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity reactions, APRs and cytokine release 
syndrome). 
In addition to the Sponsor, an external independent data monitoring committee (DMC) was, and 
will continue to be responsible for monitoring the safety of patients enrolled in phase 2/3 trials 
(DFI12712 ASCEND and LTS13632) up to the approval for marketing authorization of olipudase 
alfa of the three major markets (EU, US or Japan). 
III.2 
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
Additional pharmacovigilance in the postmarketing setting includes: 
â¢  An ongoing multinational, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, long-term extension, 
maintenance trial LTS13632 (final report planned in 2024) which aims to assess the 
long-term safety (up to 9 years) of olipudase alfa in adult and pediatric patients with ASMD 
(see details below and protocol in [Part VII Annex 3]). 
â¢  An ongoing extension phase of phase 2/3 clinical trial (DFI12712 ASCEND), multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, PD and PK of olipudase alfa in adult patients with ASMD (see details below and 
protocol in [Part VII Annex 3]).

Study short name and title 
LTS13632 - A long-term study to assess the ongoing safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa in patients with ASMD 
Rationale and study objectives 
To obtain data regarding the safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa in patients with ASMD who are exposed to long-term 
treatment with olipudase alfa. 
Primary objective: 
To assess the long-term safety of olipudase alfa in patients with ASMD. 
Secondary objective: 
To assess the maintenance of effect of olipudase alfa and to characterize the PDs and PKs following long-term 
administration. 
Study design 
Multinational, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, long-term treatment study of patients who completed the treatment 
period of the DFI13412 or DFI13803 Peds, respectively, with an acceptable safety profile. 
Patients are receiving olipudase alfa every 2 weeks for 9 years or marketing approval, whichever comes first. Patients 
started this study at the same dose they were receiving at the end of their primary study, provided that they have not 
missed more than 1 biweekly dose between studies. 
Study populations 
Pediatric and adult patients with ASMD: 25 (5 adults, 20 pediatrics)  
The patient completed the treatment period of a previous study (DFI13412 or DFI13803 Peds) of olipudase alfa with an 
acceptable benefit-risk outcome (in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor). 
The patient has no new condition or worsening of an existing condition which in the opinion of the investigator would 
preclude the patient from enrollment in the open label extension phase or could interfere with the patient participating in or 
completing the study.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART V: RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES 
(INCLUDING EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK 
MINIMIZATION ACTIVITIES)  
The risk management strategy for olipudase alfa consists in routine risk minimization measures 
(such as communication on the risks, specific clinical measures and legal status reported in the 
product information aimed to patients and HCPs) (see Table 31) and additional risk minimization 
measures (ie, educational materials) (see Table 32).

V.2  ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES  
Table 32 - Additional risk minimization measures  
A HCP guide for HCPs in home infusion setting including nurses 
Objectives 
Rationale for the additional risk 
minimization activity 
This guide is designed to support home infusion HCPs and nurses in managing the 
following risks associated with the home use of olipudase alfa:  
â¢  Immunogenicity: Infusion-associated reactions (IARs), systemic hypersensitivity 
including anaphylactic reactions, ADA mediated hypersensitivity reactions. 
â¢  Medication errors in home infusion setting. 
The guide is considered necessary and complementary to the product information, to 
re-inforce the key safety messages/instructions associated with olipudase alfa use. 
In addition, the guide includes contact information of the prescribing/ treating 
physician/centre that can be reached at any time, information on signs and 
symptoms related to IARs, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis and recommended actions 
for the management of ADRs when symptoms occur, medical evaluation of the 
patients prior to administration of the infusion at home, requirements and 
organization of the home infusion, details and instructions on the preparation, 
reconstitution, dilution and administration, a calculation template as a basis for 
recording infusion details in the patientâs medical record.  
Target audience and planned 
distribution path 
Target audiences: 
Healthcare professionals and nurses responsible for the preparation and/or 
administration of olipudase alfa in home setting. 
 
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and criteria for 
success 
Distribution paths: 
To be adapted country by country depending on each local situation and public 
health system: mail, face to face distribution, electronic (email, web link, 
QR Code/URL). 
Periodicity of the distribution: 
One single distribution at launch, then redistribution (eg, once a year, ad-hoc) can 
occur according to local regulatory requirements or national health systems. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions: 
Distribution Process outcome. 
Spontaneous reports of IARs, systemic hypersensitivity including anaphylactic 
reactions, and ADA mediated hypersensitivity reactions in home infusion setting. 
Spontaneous reports of medication errors. 
Criteria for judging success:  
Implementation status of the distribution plan, at each participating country level. 
Routine pharmacovigilance.  
A Patient Card for patients/caregivers 
Objectives 
Rationale for the additional risk 
minimization activity 
Target audience and planned 
distribution path 
This card is aimed to mitigate the risk of IARs of systemic hypersensitivity and their 
negative clinical consequences and provide instruction to WOCBP including in case 
of pregnancy. 
The patient card is considered necessary and complementary to the PL.  
â¢  To remind through a synthetic tool the signs and symptoms of IARs, so that 
patients/caregivers can react quickly, allowing early intervention and medical care. 
â¢  To remind the WOCBP to discuss with the prescribing/treating physician the need 
for effective contraceptive measures during treatment and for 14 days after the 
last dose if XENPOZYME is discontinued. 
â¢  To remind the WOCBP to contact their prescribing/treating physician if they 
suspect they might be pregnant or plan pregnancy. 
â¢  To document the prescribing/treating physicianâs emergency contact information 
for easy agreed reference. 
â¢  To provide patients with electronic access to patient card and PL in countries 
where applicable.  
â¢  The wallet size format enables the information to be easily available and shown to 
any HCP easily. 
Target audiences:  
Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency patients and/or caregivers through the 
prescribing/treating physicians and/or HCPs administering the treatment. 
Distribution paths: 
Educational materials for patients will be distributed as hard copies (and in digital 
format where possible via QR Code/URL) via prescribing/treating physicians or 
HCPs administering the treatment, depending on the local country options and 
requirements. 
Periodicity of the distribution: 
One single distribution at launch, then redistribution (eg, once a year, ad-hoc.) could 
be envisaged according to local regulatory requirements and national healthcare 
systems.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK 
MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for XENPOZYME (Olipudase alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for XENPOZYME. The RMP details 
important risks of XENPOZYME how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about XENPOZYMEâs risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
XENPOZYMEâs summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how XENPOZYME 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for XENPOZYME should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European public assessment report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
XENPOZYMEâs RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
XENPOZYME is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-central nervous 
system (CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in pediatric and adult 
patients with type A/B or type B. It contains olipudase alfa as the active substance, a recombinant 
human acid sphingomyelinase produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line by 
recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology. XENPOZYME is given by intravenous (IV) 
infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of XENPOZYMEâs benefits can be found in 
XENPOZYMEâs EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
medicines agency (EMA) website, under the medicineâs webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xenpozyme  
II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of XENPOZYME, together with measures to minimize such risks and the studies 
for learning more about XENPOZYMEâs risks are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
â¢  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advise on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs respectively; 
 
â¢ 
Important advise on the medicineâs packaging; 
â¢  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
â¢  The medicineâs legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of XENPOZYME, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions will be collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of XENPOZYME is not yet available, it is 
listed under âmissing informationâ outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of XENPOZYME are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of XENPOZYME. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical trial experience, class effects, scientific literature, other (eIND). 
Systemic hypersensitivity and IARs: 
â¢  Patients with previous hypersensitivity/allergy to olipudase alfa and its excipients. 
â¢  Available clinical data suggest children may have greater predisposition, compared 
to adults. 
Additional risk characterization has not been fully established. 
Anti-drug antibody mediated hypersensitivity reactions: 
The immunologic response to olipudase alfa in adult versus pediatric ASMD patients 
was relatively similar. Adults had a median ADA peak titer of 50 (range 50-3200) 
compared to pediatric patients with a median ADA peak titer of 200 (range 50-1600).

DFI12712 ASCEND Adults Phase 2/3 clinical trial (Cat. 3) 
Purpose of the study: 
To evaluate the efficacy, safety, PDs and PKs of olipudase alfa in adult patients with ASMD. 
Primary objectives:  
To evaluate the efficacy of olipudase alfa (recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase) administered intravenously once 
every 2 weeks for 52 weeks in adult patients with ASMD by assessing changes in: 
â¢  Spleen volume as measured by abdominal MRI. 
â¢  Infiltrative lung disease as measured by the pulmonary function test, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. 
Secondary objectives:  
â¢  To confirm the safety of olipudase alfa administered intravenously once every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. 
â¢  To characterize the effect of olipudase alfa on the patient perception related to spleen volume as measured by SRS 
after 52 weeks of study drug administration. 
 
â¢  To characterize the effect of olipudase alfa on the following endpoints assessed sequentially: 
-  The effect of olipudase alfa on liver volume after 52 weeks of study drug administration 
-  The effect of olipudase alfa on platelet count after 52 weeks of study drug administration 
-  The effect of olipudase alfa after 52 weeks of study drugs administration on fatigue 
-  The effect of olipudase alfa after 52 weeks of study drug administration on pain 
-  The effect of olipudase alfa after 52 weeks of study drug administration on dyspnea

ï· Requirements and organization of the home infusion including equipment, pre-treatment 
and emergency treatments.  
ï· Details and instructions on the preparation, reconstitution, dilution and administration of the 
product to prevent the risk of medication errors. A calculation template to prepare the 
infusion solution based on prescribed maintenance dose and patientâs body weight with 
instructions to record the calculation and infusion date. 
ï· The calculation template can be used as a basis for recording infusion details in the patientâs 
medical record.  
ï· Reminder to check if additional supplies are required.  
2.
Patient educational materials:
2.1  Patient Card for patients/caregivers
The patient card includes the following elements: 
ï·
Instruction to the patients/caregivers to seek urgent medical attention if any signs and 
symptoms of IARs, severe hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis listed in the card appear or 
worsen during and after infusion and to report the event to the treating/prescribing 
physician. 
ï· Contact information of the prescribing/treating physician/centre that can be reached at any 
time. 
ï· Reminder to the women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) to discuss with the 
prescribing/treating physician the need for effective contraceptive measures during 
treatment and for 14 days after the last dose if XENPOZYME is discontinued.

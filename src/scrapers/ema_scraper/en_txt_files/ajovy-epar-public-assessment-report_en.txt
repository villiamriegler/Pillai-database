2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine  is  a  neurological  disorder,  characterized  by  recurrent  episodes  of  headaches,  accompanied  by 
associated  symptoms  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  photophobia  and  phonophobia.    The  headache  is  often 
unilateral, of moderate to severe intensity, throbbing and aggravated by physical activity. An attack can be 
preceded by sensory warning symptoms or signs (auras), and may last for 4-72 hours. The attacks are often 
disabling and associated with missed activities at work, school or at home.  
Migraine  is  conceptualized  as  a  spectrum  disorder  with  two  categories:  episodic  migraine  (EM)  and  chronic 
migraine  (CM).  EM  is  characterized  by  acute  headache  attacks.  EM  accompanied  by  aura  is  called  classical 
migraine.    Individuals  with  EM  experience  headaches  on  less  than  15  days  per  month  whereas  CM  is 
characterized by more than 15 headache days per month, with at least 8 days being migraine days. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Migraine is a common neurological disorder that affects more than 10% of adults globally. The proportion of 
adults reporting migraine attacks in a single year is 15% in both Europe and the United States. Women are 
affected  three  times  more  often  than  men.  The  prevalence  is  highest  during  the  peak  performance  years 
(around 30 to 50 years of age), which provides a significant burden to the sufferer, family and society. Patients 
with EM progress to CM at a yearly rate of around 2.5%. 
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that seems to be involved in the pathophysiology 
of neurovascular headaches such as migraine at both central and peripheral levels. It is extensively distributed 
at the trigeminal nerve endings and the trigeminal ganglion. At the peripheral level the release of CGRP leads to 
vasodilation and inflammation and it modulates the  transmission of pain. It was shown that interictal CGRP 
levels are elevated in peripheral blood in both EM and CM patients. These levels were higher in CM patients.  
In  clinical  research,  small  molecule  CGRP  receptor  antagonists  were  initially  investigated  against  the  CGRP 
pathway for migraine treatment. However the molecules were found to be hepatotoxic in several studies, which 
led to the switch to the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAB) against the CGRP ligand or receptor. mABs 
bind specific to the target, have long half-lives and are not metabolized by the liver, leading to better treatment 
compliance and low risk for liver enzyme elevations. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Migraine is a disorder of recurrent headache attacks. A typical attack progresses through four phases. There is 
a prodromal phase, characterized by the presence of affective or vegetative symptoms that appear 24 to 48 
hours prior to headache onset. This phase can be followed by the aura, in which one or more focal neurological 
symptoms are present. Though this phase does not occur in every patient, and does not necessarily have to 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 9/116 
  
  
 
 
precede  the  headache,  some  patients  experience  the  aura  and  headache  combined.  The  headache  is 
characterized by an often unilateral and throbbing/pulsating pain which can be accompanied by symptoms such 
as nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia. Once the spontaneous throbbing of the headache resolves, 
in the postdromal phase, the patient experiences feeling drained or exhausted or sometimes even mild elation 
or euphoria.  
Several  factors  may  trigger  a  migraine  attack  such  as  (emotional)  stress,  hormone  levels  (related  to  the 
menstrual cycle in women) or sleep disturbances.  
Migraine is diagnosed based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 
3rd edition (ICHD-3). A patient must have had at least 5 headache attacks that lasted 4-72 hours (untreated or 
unsuccessfully treated). These headaches must fulfil at least two of the following criteria: unilateral location, 
pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical 
activity. During the headache at least one of the following symptoms should occur: nausea/vomiting or both, or 
photophobia and phonophobia.  
Migraine has also been associated with ischaemic stroke and ischaemic heart disease, in particular in women 
and patients with aura. 
Long term prognosis of migraine varies. Symptoms can gradually decrease over the years or resolve completely, 
they can continue with the same frequency and severity or become worse and more frequent.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Migraine treatment can be subdivided into two categories: acute medication and prophylactic medication.  
Acute  medication  is  aimed  to  relieve  pain  and  restore  function  during  upcoming  acute  headache  attacks. 
Typically used agents are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans with or without concomitant 
antiemetics.  
Prophylactic  treatment  is  intended  to  prevent  the  occurrence  of  attacks  /  headache.  Several  migraine 
prophylactic  treatments  are  available  in  the  European  Union,  though  the  approval  varies  between  member 
states.  It  is  recommended  by  the  European  Federation  of  Neurological  Societies  (EFNS)  that  first-choice 
prophylactic  treatment  are  either  beta-blockers  (metoprolol  and  propranolol),  calcium  channel  blockers 
(flunarizine) or anticonvulsants (topiramate and valproic acid).  
Botulinum toxin A is currently the only treatment approved in some member states (including NL) for migraine 
prophylaxis  in  adults  with  CM  who  have  responded  inadequately  or  are  intolerant  to  other  prophylactic 
medication.  
Epidemiology  studies  suggest  that  only  a  small  proportion  of  patients  that  are  candidate  for  prophylactic 
treatment currently take preventative medication. Moreover patients often switch prophylactic medication. This 
is likely due to the combination of titration schedules, requirement of daily dosing, side effects and delayed 
onset of efficacy affecting long-term compliance and/or insufficient long term efficacy.

About the product 
Fremanezumab , the active substance in Ajovy, is a fully humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) Δa monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) derived from a murine precursor. Fremanezumab is a potent, selective calcitonin gene-related 
peptide (CGRP) mAb that binds to and blocks both CGRP isoforms (α- and β-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP 
receptor. Ajovy is presented in a pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous administration.    
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 225 mg of fremanezumab as active 
substance. Other ingredients are: L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, disodium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) acid dihydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in a type I glass syringe with plunger stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and needle. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Fremanezumab  is  a  monoclonal  IgG2  antibody  targeting  both  isoforms  of  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide 
(CGRP; α- and β-CGRP). Fremanezumab is produced in CHO cells and is N-glycosylated at position Asn298 at the 
heavy chain. O-glycosylation has not been reported. 
Fremanezumab  is  comprised  of  two  identical  light  chains  and  two  identical  heavy  chains.  Each  light  chain 
consists of 214 amino acid residues, while each heavy chain is predicted to contain 448 residues. There are a 
total of 36 cysteine residues in the molecule with the potential to form disulfide bonds. The C-termini of the 
heavy  chains  are  primarily  of  the  des-Lys  form,  which  is  typical  of  IgG  molecules  expressed  in  the  Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. As such, the heavy chain actually consists of 447 residues. The molecular weight 
is 148 kDa. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Celltrion Inc, Incheon, South Korea is responsible for manufacture and testing of the active substance.  
The active substance is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  reflects  a  standard  process  for  monoclonal  antibodies.  The 
upstream  cell  culture  process  consists  of  three  consecutive  stages  (inoculum  expansion,  seed  bioreactor 
expansion, and cell culture and antibody production). The upstream process ends with a bioreactor harvest and 
clarification  step.  The  antibody  is  subsequently  purified  and  polished  using  standard  chromatography 
techniques, virus inactivation, viral filtration, and ultra-/diafiltration. The downstream process ends with the 
final formulation and final filtration.  
An adequate batch numbering system is in place. 
The  applicant  described the  control  strategy,  which  takes  the  principles  laid  out  in  ICH  Q8-11  into  account. 
Process  parameters  (PP)  and  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  are  divided  into  critical  (i.e.  CPP  and  CIPC)  and 
non-critical ones.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 11/116 
  
  
 
Reprocessing  is  described  for  the  virus  reduction  filtration  step  and  for  the  final  filtration  step,  sufficient 
information on the handling of a reprocessing event has been provided.  
Control of materials 
The applicant provided adequate information regarding the raw materials used during the manufacturing of the 
active  substance.  Compendial  substances  are  released  according  to  their  pharmacopeial  requirements. 
Acceptance criteria and test methods for non-compendial materials have been provided. Adequate information 
on the control of chromatography resins is provided. 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in upstream, cell culturing, and downstream manufacturing 
process. Foetal bovine serum (FBS) was used in the early phase of fremanezumab cell line development. The 
master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) have been stored and cultivated in FBS-free medium. 
The fremanezumab expression vector is derived from a humanized hybridoma clone. Manufacturing of the MCB 
and WCB has been described and was performed under GMP conditions.  
Stability of the MCB and WCB has been demonstrated with regard to cell viability and growth characteristics. The 
MCB, WCB, and end of production cells (EPCs) have been tested in line with ICH Q5A. With the exception of the 
retrovirus particles and reverse transcriptase activity in EPCs, no adventitious agents were detected. The MCB 
has been tested for sterility, bacteriostasis and fungistasis, mycoplasma, and mycoplasmastasis.  
Genetic stability of the cell banks has been addressed in line with ICH Q5B.   
A procedure for generation of new working cell banks has been described. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The CPPs, IPCs and CIPCs listed for the critical steps and intermediates are considered acceptable to control that 
the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  consistent  and  robust  production  of  active  substance  meeting  the 
fremanezumab critical quality attributes (CQAs). The limits defined for the bioburden and endotoxin levels are 
considered acceptable. The microbial control tests (bioburden and endotoxin) have been verified according to 
the respective compendia. 
No intermediates are defined. In process hold times are included in the manufacturing process description.  
Process validation 
Manufacturing process validation was performed using three consecutive process verification lots for the active 
substance  manufactured  with  the  commercial  process.  Additionally  three  further  active  substance  lots  have 
been  run  as  backup,  which  were  terminated  at  earlier  manufacturing  steps.  Results  have  been  reported  as 
supporting data. Media solution hold times have been validated. Overall, the upstream manufacturing process 
can be considered robust and validated.   
During process verification all acceptance criteria for PPs and CPPs, as well as endotoxin levels have been met 
for the buffers used during downstream manufacturing. 
The  down-stream  manufacturing  process  steps  met  all  process  verification  acceptance  criteria  and 
demonstrated that the process can be executed in a robust and consistent manner.  
The  provided  data  support  the  in  process  hold  duration  and  temperature  for  the  different  active  substance 
manufacturing steps up to and including excipient addition. The final filtration and filling step was shown to be 
robust and consistent. All acceptance criteria have been met.  
Biochemical  and  microbial  stability  data  for  the  intermediate  pool  holds  have  been  provided.  Additionally,  a 
worst case study was performed, which demonstrated that the maximal allowed hold time does not affect the 
tested  active  substance  intermediate  QAs.  The  proposed  target  numbers  of  chromatograph  resin  cycles  are 
supported by small scale validation studies. It is agreed that the manufacturing scale resin lifetime study is 
on-going concurrently with clinical and commercial manufacturing. As stated in the dossier “If the resin lifetime 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 12/116 
  
  
 
study extends beyond the manufacturer’s expiration date, the maximum use period will be defined as the period 
from the resin manufactured date to the study end date.” This is considered acceptable.  
Small-scale  and  large-scale  chromatography  carry  over  studies  have  been  completed  or  are  concurrently 
performed,  respectively.  The  results  verify  the  resin  cycle  numbers.  The  approach  used  to  monitor  TFF 
membrane performance gives no reason for concern.  
In  support  of  the  proposed  reprocessing  for  the  virus  filtration  step  and  the  final  filtration  step,  small  scale 
validation studies are performed. No negative effect on product quality was observed in these studies. Full scale 
validation on a total of 3 batches will be performed if a manufacturing event necessitates reprocessing. The 
provided study protocol summary is acceptable.  
A risk assessment for the leachables from the single-use (SU) equipment used during up- and down-stream 
active  substance  manufacturing  has  been  performed.  Medium  risk  components  were  further  analysed  in 
worst-case  leachable  studies.  An  ongoing  process  verification  program  has  been  implemented  for  the 
fremanezumab lifecycle. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process of fremanezumab active substance has been improved during development from 
process  1  (1P)  over  2P  to  the  proposed  commercial  process  3P.  The  changes  included  scale-ups  and  a 
manufacturing site transfer.  
The evaluation of comparability between 3P and 1P/2P consists of a comparison of the results of multiple tests 
to determine relevant product attributes (primary structure, molecular mass, secondary/higher order structure, 
post-translational modifications, biological activity, purity and impurities). Three 3P lots, 1 2P lot, and 1 1P lot 
were included in the comparison. The comparability assessment is limited in terms of number of batches that are 
included, but the test panel is acceptable and the results give no reason for concern. The phase 3 clinical trial has 
been performed with batches manufactured according to process 3P. Only minor changes are made from clinical 
manufacturing to process verification.  
The upstream and downstream process characterisation has been described.  
The PP acceptable ranges (AR) are considered acceptable. For the production bioreactor the impact of PP on 
product  QAs  and  process  performance  attributes    have  been  investigated.  Appropriate  analyses  have  been 
performed and IPCs, CIPCs and PP ranges defined.  
Characterisation 
A  range  of  state-of-the-art  orthogonal  methods  has  been  employed  to  characterise    fremanezumab  active 
substance. The primary structure, higher order structures, and the biological activity of fremanezumab were 
evaluated using a series of biochemical, biophysical and functional characterisation techniques.  
Primary structure:  
The primary structure was evaluated and 100% coverage was achieved confirming the predicted cDNA-derived 
primary  sequence.  Disulfide  bonding  was  analysed  and  confirmed  structural  intactness  of  the  fully  bonded 
molecule with low levels of free thiols.  
Higher order structure: 
Analyses demonstrated the common mAb secondary structure distribution (mainly β-sheets, and random coils 
and  lower  amounts  of  α-helices,  bends,  and  turns)  of  fremanezumab.  Fremanezumab  was  shown  to  be 
temperature stable and shows three temperature transitions. A comprehensive crystal structure analyses has 
been performed to determine the epitope/paratope interactions between fremanezumab and its antigen CGRP.  
Biological activity: 
The biological activity of fremanezumab was appropriately characterised. Binding of fremanezumab to CGRP 
was demonstrated to be highly specific. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 13/116 
  
  
Analyses were performed to determine the binding affinities of fremanezumab to Fcγ-Receptors.  
C1q binding (initial step CDC) was determined for fremanezumab, and shown to be negligible.  
ADCC activity was not analysed for fremanezumab. This is considered acceptable because the antibody belongs 
to the IgG2 family and did not show significant Fcγ-RIII binding. Furthermore, fremanezumab binds to a soluble 
antigen, which makes a potential ADCC activity more unlikely. 
Post-Translational Modifications (PTM): 
Fremanezumab contains commonly seen PTMs. These are not considered to represent a safety issue as they are 
naturally occurring in humans.  
The glycosylation pattern was shown to be similar to that commonly seen for mAbs.  
Overall  the  characterisation  of  fremanezumab  is  considered  acceptable.  The  process-related  impurities  are 
sufficiently described and controlled.  
The  applicant  has  appropriately  characterised  the  active  substance  and  product  variants,  and  elucidated 
degradation pathways by forced degradation.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure 
The control tests proposed for the active substance are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with 
respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety (microbial). 
The specifications for the release of the active substance are adequately justified based on release and stability 
data. For some parameters the applicant has committed to re-evaluate the limits when data from further 
batches become available. 
Analytical methods 
Descriptions of all analytical methods and summaries of validations thereof are provided.  
The validation of the analytical procedures has been performed taking the recommendation of ICH guideline Q2 
(R1) into account. The compendial tests have been validated according to their respective monographs. 
For potency determination a cell-based bioassay is used. Neuroblastoma cells are cultivated in the presence of 
CGRP which induces cAMP formation. Addition of active substance samples (fremanezumab) prevents CGRP 
binding thereby inhibiting cAMP formation. Intercellular cAMP is fluorescently measured as read-out.  
Batch analysis 
A sufficient number of fremanezumab active substance batches have been produced. Adequate information on 
every batch (date of manufacturing, manufacturer/process, cell bank and use) has been provided. All batches 
met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of manufacturing. The batch results of the active substance 
batches manufactured with the proposed commercial formulation at the GMP manufacturing facility at Celltrion, 
Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, Republic of Korea indicate that the manufacturing process is robust. 
Reference materials 
During early development an interim reference standard was established. It was used as reference standard for 
Phase 1-3 clinical lot release and stability. During clinical Phase 3 development a two-tiered system has been 
established. A Phase 3 manufacturing process lot was used to create the primary reference standard (PRS). 
Characterisation demonstrated that the PRS is representative of batches produced under the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process. As a second part of the two-tiered system the working reference standard 
(WRS) derived from a commercial manufacturing process and process verification lot was established. The WRS 
was characterised side-by-side with the PRS. The results demonstrated high comparability between both 
standards and qualify WRS to be used as reference for commercial lot release and stability testing. Stability of 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 14/116 
  
  
the reference standards will be monitored by predefined stability protocols. After the PRS has expired a new PRS 
will be qualified against the current PRS. New WRS will be qualified against a current PRS.  
Container closure 
The active substance is stored in carboys, with a screw cap. Sufficient description of the container closure and 
applied specifications has been provided. The CCS is considered safe in terms of extractables and leachables.  
Stability 
The active substance stability program used long-term, accelerated and stressed storage conditions as defined 
in ICH Q5C. Data from a sufficient number of primary and supportive stability lots have been provided. The data 
provided did not show significant changes in the quality attributes tested.  
Considering the totality of data from primary and supportive batches, the proposed active substance shelf-life is 
considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product is provided as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. The composition is shown in 
Table 2 below.  
Sufficient information is provided on the control of excipients. The excipients used for the fremanezumab 
finished product are L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, EDTA, polysorbate 80, and 
water for injection. All excipients are Ph. Eur. grade. No novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin 
are used.

The finished product formulation is identical to the active substance formulation (150 mg/mL fremanezumab; 
histidine; sucrose; EDTA; PS80 at pH 5.5). 
Compatibility of the finished product with the container closure system has been investigated in syringes at the 
recommended, accelerated and stressed conditions. The results demonstrated that under the recommended 
storage conditions the quality attributes did not change.  
A controlled extraction and a simulation study have been performed to evaluate extractables and leachables, 
which might leak into the finished product under harsh and more realistic conditions, respectively. The results 
demonstrate that the most of the detected compounds or impurities are below the Product Quality Research 
Institute (PQRI) Parental and Ophthalmic Drug Product (PODP) working group’s qualification threshold (QT). 
The compounds and impurities above that threshold have been further evaluated taking the recommendations 
of ICH Q3C and Q3D into account. The calculated worst-case exposures are well below the calculated permitted 
daily uptakes (PDE). Tungsten and Silicone have been further analysed for their effect on finished product 
quality attributes using spiking studies. No effect has been shown. Overall the extractable and leachable profile 
of fremanezumab does not raise concerns to patient safety.  
The risk assessment for elemental impurities has been performed in accordance with ICH Q3D and an adequate 
summary is included in the dossier. 
A design verification was performed to evaluate the suitability of the fremanezumab injection PFS. Functional 
performance has been demonstrated. 
The manufacturing process of the fremanezumab finished product changed during development, from the initial 
process 1P over 2P to the proposed commercial process 3P. Changes during development include a 
manufacturing site transfer and changes to the formulation and container closure. The finished product 
manufacturing process is divided into two parts. The primary process consists of active substance thaw, pooling, 
mixing, filtration, filling and visual inspection. The secondary process encompasses assembly and packaging of 
the PFS. In order to evaluate the robustness of the unit operations and to define ranges for the validation studies 
as well as IPCs, process characterization (PC) studies have been performed. Prior to the conduct of the PC 
studies the control strategy has been defined and a risk assessment performed, taking the recommendations of 
ICH Q9 into account. Possible CQAs have been defined and a failure-mode and effects analyses (FMEA) was 
performed. 
The PC studies are sufficiently well designed. IPC, CIPCS and PP and CPP have been defined based on the 
provided results.  The filling process will be performed at room temperature. As this storage condition has an 
impact on CQA of the finished product the maximal time of filling is defined and controlled as a CPP. 
Secondary packaging will be performed at room temperature. An AR and normal operating range (NOR) has 
been assigned based on secondary packaging capabilities, data from overall process times from process 
characterization studies and accelerated stability data. 
The fremanezumab finished product cannot be terminally sterilized and is therefore sterile filtered and 
aseptically filled into sterile PFS.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Batch release 
is carried out at Merckle GmbH, Ulm, Germany and Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe B.V., Haarlem, The 
Netherlands.  
The manufacturing process of the fremanezumab finished product consists of two stages: 1) manufacturing of 
the pre-filled syringe (PFS); 2) secondary packaging of the PFS (combination product). The manufacturing of the 
PFS is performed as standard fill-and-finish process, with no addition of new excipients.  
Reprocessing is not considered for the finished product manufacturing process. 
The CPPs and CIPCs have been listed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 16/116 
  
  
Process validation has been performed using process verification parameters and IPC results. Physico-chemical, 
biological and technical assays have been used as process verification parameters at the different stages of the 
process. The batch hold times were intentionally exceeded to prove that the assigned maximal hold times do not 
affect process parameters or finished product QAs. The results of 3 subsequent commercial process lots 
demonstrate reproducible and robust processes. All results stayed within the predefined acceptance criteria and 
proven acceptable ranges.  
The filters used for bioreduction and sterile filtration have been validated. Extractable and Leachable studies 
were performed under worst-case conditions. Extractable and Leachables from the filter materials are 
considered to pose a low-risk regarding safety and product quality.  
The filling machine is validated by media fills according to an approved standard operating procedure (SOP). 
Summaries of the last three media fill runs have been provided and demonstrate that the machine is capable to 
perform aseptic filling operations. Validation of the secondary packaging step has been performed for the three 
subsequent process verification batches. All CPP have been met as reported.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications are set in accordance with Ph. Eur. requirements and ICH Q6B. They are 
considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety 
(microbial). 
Justifications have been provided for the finished product specifications. The acceptance limits for some of the 
parameters are considered wide, however the applicant provided a commitment to re-evaluate these limits 
when data from further batches become available (see “Recommendations for future quality development”).  
Analytical methods 
General tests for the finished product (Visible Particles, Volume in Container and Sub-Visible Particles) and 
safety tests (Sterility (membrane filtration)) are performed according to the Ph. Eur. Monographs. The test for 
container integrity is performed according to USP <1207> and a summary of test parameters is provided. 
Descriptions of all analytical methods and summaries of validations thereof are provided.  
A cell-based assay is used to measure the potency of fremanezumab (see active substance section).  
Batch analysis 
The batch results for the finished product indicate that the manufacturing process is robust. All acceptance 
criteria were met.  
Reference materials 
Please refer to the active substance section, the reference standards used for active substance and finished 
product are identical. 
Container closure 
The container closure system consists of a 2.25ml single-dose prefilled syringe. The syringe barrel and its 
constituent parts conform to accepted standards. Technical drawings and specifications are provided. The 
specifications provided are acceptable. Respective vendor certificates have been provided for the syringe and 
the stoppers. Both components comply with applicable monographs.  
Stability of the product 
The stability program for the finished product has been designed taking the recommendations of ICH Q1A and 
ICH Q5C into account. It includes primary, secondary packaged, and supportive lots. The lots were placed on 
stability at long term, accelerated, and stressed conditions. The primary batches have been manufactured from 
active substance batches produced at the commercial manufacturing site and are therefore considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 17/116 
  
  
representative of the proposed commercial product. A sufficient number of batches, which have been secondary 
packaged have been included and tested for functionality.  
The results show that the finished product remains stable at the recommended storage condition and no 
significant trends were observed. Furthermore, the finished product remains within the stability specifications 
upon limited exposure at accelerated and at stress conditions.  
Beside the main stability study a photostability according to ICH Q1B and temperature excursion studies have 
been performed. The photostability study demonstrates that the finished product is sensitive to light. Hence, the 
finished product should be stored protected from light and this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Considering the data provided, the proposed finished product shelf life of 24 months at 2-8°C is acceptable. 
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been included in relation to the planned addition of 
an additional finished product manufacturing site. To support this, an outline of the comparability assessment 
has been submitted.  
The PACMP is considered acceptable. The applicant intends to implement the addition of the new site through a 
Type IB variation. 
Adventitious agents 
Compliance with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has 
been sufficiently demonstrated. The active substance is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No other 
material of bovine origin is added during fermentation. The MCB which has been established is free from 
TSE-risk substances. 
The use of a serum-free medium for the fermentation process minimizes a possible contamination of 
adventitious viruses. The cells used for production have been extensively screened for viruses. These tests failed 
to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB with the exception of intracellular A- and 
C-type retroviral particles which are well known to be present in rodent cells. This is acceptable since there is 
sufficient capacity within the manufacturing procedure for reduction of this type of viral particles. The 
purification process includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. The effectiveness of 
these steps has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicated consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
Assessment report

recommends to review some active substance and finished product specification acceptance criteria once a 
pre-determined number of batches will have been manufactured. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant submitted a comprehensive data package to characterise non-clinical development of 
fremanezumab.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Fremanezumab is a fully humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) Δa monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to 
human calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is a potent vasodilator and has been shown to be 
important in the pathophysiology of migraine. Binding affinities of fremanezumab were determined in three 
different studies for human, rat and rabbit CGRP. The affinities of fremanezumab to rat and human α-CGRP are 
different depending on the used method.  
Compared to human CGRP in which the binding affinity was high, the binding affinity is 29-400x lower for the rat 
and 50-244x lower for the rabbit. Since human and cynomolgus monkey CGRP have identical amino acid 
sequences, it is assumed that the binding affinities for both species are the same, thus lack of specific monkey 
data is acceptable. Based on these differences in binding affinity, rat and rabbit are relevant species, but less 
relevant than cynomolgus monkey. Biacore analysis further revealed that fremanezumab binds specifically to 
CGRP and not to the family members amylin, intermedin and calcitonin and extremely weakly to 
adrenomedullin.  
In vitro 
Cell based assays were conducted to determine the ability of fremanezumab to block activation of adenylate 
cyclase after stimulation with human or rat α-CGRP and to fremanezumab inhibits binding of CGRP to its 
receptor. It was demonstrated that fremanezumab binds equal or lower to FcγR than an IgG2 control. Also, as 
it was demonstrated that binding of CGRP to its receptor CGRPR1 was impaired by fremanezumab, additional 
ADCC or CDC assays are not deemed necessary. 
In vivo 
No complete animal model of migraine is available. Restriction of blood flow via inhibition of CGRP after 
administration of fremanezumab was assessed in several animal models, including animal models of pain. No 
experimental animal data exists that would support efficacy in quarterly administrations clinically. The in vivo 
evidence includes models of peripheral vasodilation and arterial vasodilation that show blockade of CGRP 
mediated signalling results in the inhibition of vasodilation, which can be maintained for up to 56 days. Inhibition 
of CGRP also results in the alleviation of symptoms associated with migraine in several animal models of disease 
(PoC). Fremanezumab is intended to be administered in excess to allow complete and sustained blockade of its 
target molecule, CGRP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 19/116 
  
  
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. CGRP is a potent vasodilator with a wide expression 
in neuronal tissue. Given the pleiotropic activity of CGRP the applicant has provided a discussion on the role of 
CGRP in wound-healing and in pregnancy.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In addition to the pivotal toxicology studies, three separate safety pharmacology studies were conducted.  
Fremanezumab (100 mg/kg) had no meaningful effect on changes in heart rate, blood pressure, ECG recordings 
or body temperature in conscious telemetered monkeys. Decreases in heart rate noted during the 1-3.75 and 
18-22 hours period on Days 3, 7, 10, and 14, reached statistical significance and are considered moderate. This 
decrease in heart rate is attributed to the moderate decreases in activity measures obtained during these same 
periods. It is considered likely that these decreases reflect the absence of in-room activities associated with dose 
administration, and not a treatment effect. Blood pressure was similarly statistically significantly and transiently 
reduced but without any meaningful clinical consequence. In repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys given 
weekly fremanezumab doses up to 300 mg/kg, there were no notable changes in any cardiovascular 
parameters, confirming that the minor transient changes seen in the cardiovascular safety study are not 
biologically meaningful.  
Fremanezumab given s.c. up to 300 mg/kg had no effect on a battery of behavioural and physiological 
parameters in rats, nor did it result in changes in respiratory parameters. The data suggest that, in line with 
other centrally acting therapeutic antibodies, fremanezumab has no adverse effect on cardiovascular, 
respiratory or CNS safety. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fremanezumab  pharmacokinetic  profile  was  characterized  following  intravenous  (iv)  administration  to  mice, 
rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Toxicokinetic profiles were characterized in rat and monkey following 
once  weekly  iv  or  subcutaneous  (sc)  dosing  for  a  total  duration  of  up  to  3  months  in  rats  and  6  months  in 
monkeys. Fetal exposure was characterized as part of the Embryo-Fetal Development Study in Rabbits and in 
the pre- and post-natal development study (PPND) in rats. 
Methods of analysis 
Three  different  ELISA  methods  were  used  for  the  determination  of  fremanezumab  in  plasma.  The  provided 
validation reports demonstrate that the assays were sensitive, selective and suitable to assess fremanezumab 
concentrations in monkey, rabbit, mouse and/or rat plasma. For the assay used in the single dose studies, the 
lower and upper limits of quantitation (LLOQ and ULOQ) were 1.95 and 125 ng/ml. This assay was validated for 
heparin samples, whereas in the single dose rabbit and monkey studies EDTA samples were collected. This is not 
expected to affect the results. It is noted that no storage stability and matrix effect data were provided for the 
assay used for the single dose studies. For the assay used in the 1 and 3 month studies and some of the rat repro 
studies, the LLOQ and ULOQ were 100 and 7500 ng/ml. For the assay used in the 6 month study and newest 
repro studies, the LLOQ and ULOQ were 250 and 3500 ng/ml. These latter assays were adequately validated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 20/116 
  
  
 
 
For  the  detection  of  antibodies  against  fremanezumab,  bridging  ELISA  methods  were  developed  for  rat  and 
monkey serum. The assays were selective and the sensitivity was found to be 0.8 ng/mL for the assay in rat 
serum (used for the 3 month study), 0.027 ng/ml for the old assay in monkey serum (used for the 3 month 
studies) and 28 ng/ml for the new assay in monkey serum (used in the 6 month study). In the newest assay 
(validated for monkey serum) drug tolerance was 336 μg/mL for fremanezumab and no interference up to 1200 
ng/ml CGRP was observed. It should be noted, however, that the levels of fremanezumab in serum may be well 
above the drug tolerance levels leading therefore, to interfere with the assay sensitivity for ADA detection.  
An assay to assess the presence of neutralizing capability of the ADA’s is not provided or discussed. 
Absorption 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mice, rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, with IV 
doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw. In three monkeys (1 mid dose and both high dose) and almost all rabbits, 
an abrupt decrease in plasma concentration was observed at 1-4 weeks after dosing, presumably due to the 
formation  of  (clearing)  antibodies.  For  these  animals,  both  full  and  truncated  (excluding  the  plasma 
concentrations from the moment the abrupt decrease started) PK analyses were performed.  
In  general,  fremanezumab  showed  a  biphasic  decline,  with  an  initial  distribution  phase,  followed  by  a  slow 
elimination phase. The steady state volume of distribution is low, about 2–3 fold the plasma volume (i.e 0.09 – 
0.14 L/kg) in rabbit, monkey, mouse and rat and in line with human (0.085 L/kg). Plasma clearance was low (i.e. 
0.003-0.006 ml/min/kg) in rabbit, monkey, mouse  and rat and seems to be even lower in humans (0.0013 
ml/min/kg). Systemic exposure of fremanezumab increased in a dose proportional manner over the dose range 
of 10 to 100 mg/kg. Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was approximately 16 days in rats, 19 days in mice, 10 
days in monkeys and 8 days in rabbits but may be influenced by ADA formation from 1 week after dosing in the 
latter two species. 
Multiple dose pharmaco- and toxicokinetic studies were performed in rats (1 and 3 months IV and 3 months SC) 
and cynomolgus monkeys (1 and 3 months IV and 1, 3 and 6 months SC) upon weekly administration at dose 
levels of 10 - 300 mg/kg. Absorption of fremanezumab was slow after SC dosing, with Tmax at 42 h in the 3 
months  study  in  rats  and  24  -  114  h  in  the  1,  3  and  6  months  studies  in  monkeys.  After  repeated dosing, 
systemic exposure of fremanezumab increased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the dose 
range of 10 to 300 mg/kg in monkeys but less than dose proportional in the 3 month study in rats.  
The  mean  terminal  half-life  (t1/2)  of  fremanezumab,  administered  SC,  ranged  from  14  to  18  days  in  the 
6-month study in monkeys and was 13 days in the 3 month study in rats, compared to 35 days in humans. 
According to the study reports, accumulation ratios were low to moderate in the 3 months study in rats (1.8-3.7 
for AUC0-168 for once weekly IV and 1.8 for once weekly SC, AUC week 13 compared to day 1) and moderate to 
high in the 6 month study in monkeys (3.2 to 9.1 for AUC0-168 for once weekly SC, AUC from day 176 compared 
to day 1).  At comparable SC doses, maximal plasma concentrations in the 6 month study were higher at D85 
compared to the 3 month study in cynomolgus monkeys (1.5-4x). This may be due to the different formulations 
of fremanezumab used in these studies. 
The mean SC bioavailability of fremanezumab was approximately 65-67% and 81-89% (range 69-100%) in the 
3-month studies in rats and monkeys, respectively. This is slightly higher when compared to healthy humans 
(~55%). There were no apparent gender differences in exposure. 
It is noted that in some of the studies, fremanezumab was observed in samples from control animals (rat and 
monkey). According to the applicant, this cannot be explained by accidental injection of the control animals with 
the test substance, and that no major deviations from standard operating procedure were reported. However, 
since the assays were adequately validated, the observed values are unexpected.

Distribution 
Consistent  with  the  known  biodistribution  of  monoclonal  antibodies,  fremanezumab  has  a  low  volume  of 
distribution, suggesting a distribution to plasma and extravascular fluid. 
Foetal exposure to fremanezumab was confirmed in Embryo-Foetal Development Studies in rats and rabbits. In 
rats  dosed  50  -  200  mg/kg  bw  once  weekly  (sc)  from  GD6  to  PND21,  dam/pup  plasma  concentration  ratio 
(measured 72 h post dose) were 1.3-1.6 at PND4 and 2.1-2.5 on PND21.  
In rabbits dosed 10-100 mg/kg/week, the fetal exposure measured on GD25 was approximately 11-20% of the 
Cmax value measured in the dams after the last dose administered on GD18. Based on the plasma concentration 
time curve in the dams, it is expected that the concentration in the foetus at GD25 (168h post last dose) is in the 
plateau phase. 
Excretion to milk has not been investigated. 
Fremanezumab  demonstrated  similar  or  lower  affinity  to  human  Fc  gamma  receptors  compared  to  an  IgG2 
control  antibody  and  lower  affinity  compared  to  an  IgG1  control  antibody.  This  is  consistent  with  the  two 
mutations in the constant region of the fremanezumab heavy chain to limit Fc effector function. Binding to the 
FcRn receptor was similar to two control IgG2 antibodies.

No metabolism studies with fremanezumab were conducted in animals. The absence of metabolism studies is in 
accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Excretion 
As  fremanezumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody,  no  renal  excretion  is  anticipated  due  to  its  molecular  size. 
Therefore, no specific studies to measure excretion of fremanezumab were conducted. The absence of excretion 
studies in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-drug  interaction  at  the  PK  level  is  highly  unlikely  for  this  type  of  product  since  biotechnology-derived 
substances do not metabolize via CYP P450 enzymes. However, the mechanism of action of a drug may have an 
effect on CYP450 enzymes or on transporters through cytokine dependent modulation but for fremanezumab 
this is unlikely and no such evidence was found.  
The Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) are assessed in the clinical PK section.

Immunogenicity 
Antibodies against fremanezumab were observed in several of the studies in non-human species, which can be 
expected since fremanezumab is a humanized antibody. In the six month study in monkeys (SC injections once 
weekly)  5  out  of  28  animals  (17.8%)  dosed  with  fremanezumab  had  treatment-related  ADA  response  with 
relative low titer values,  which apparently did not influence exposure, considering the fact that exposure to 
fremanezumab was generally similar on Days 85 and 176 in ADA-positive and negative animals. However, also 
in the 3 month study in  monkeys and rats (IV or  SC injections once weekly) and in the 1 month studies in 
monkeys and rats (using an older, less robust immunogenicity method) treatment related ADA’s were observed 
and in these studies, the presence of anti-drug antibodies in the serum of animals did appear to affect exposure. 
In  these  studies  there  seemed  to  be  at  least  some  correlation  between  presence  of  antibodies  and  plasma 
concentrations of fremanezumab. Moreover, in the single dose IV studies 3/6 monkeys and almost all rabbits 
showed a PK profile suggesting the presence of clearing ADA’s. It is noted that the anti-fremanezumab antibody 
data  might  be  an  underestimation  since  the  presence  of  fremanezumab  may  inhibit  detection  of 
anti-fremanezumab antibodies and the plasma fremanezumab concentrations in the tested samples were, in 
general, above the provided drug-tolerance levels. The possibility of a neutralizing capability of the ADA’s is not 
assessed. In addition, it is noted that ADAs were detected in samples from control animals as well as in pre-dose 
samples. Similarly, in some of the studies fremanezumab was observed in control samples. Since the assays 
seem  to  be  well  validated,  the  findings  of  multiple  positive  control  samples  (fremanezumab  or  ADA)  are 
unexpected.  
Despite  the  presence  of  ADAs,  it  seems  that  the  fremanezumab  in  the  majority  of  the  animals  remains 
sufficiently high to evaluate the toxicity of fremanezumab.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
An extensive non-clinical in vivo programme was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of fremanezumab. A 
single-dose toxicity study was conducted in the rat; the repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in the 
cynomolgus monkey and the rat. The reproduction toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Given the 
lower affinity to rat and rabbit CGRP, the cynomolgus may be considered more relevant for assessing the human 
risk.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with the duration of 1 month and 3 months were conducted both in rats and 
monkeys; the pivotal 26-week study was only conducted in monkeys.  
Toxicity studies in the rat 
In  rats,  notable  effects  were  decreased  food  consumption  in  all  fremanezumab  treated  groups  without 
corresponding decreases in weight. From 100 mg/kg/wk onwards, increased globulin was observed, which also 
resulted  in  increased  total  protein  and  decreased  albumin/globulin  ratio.  These  findings  are  considered 
non-adverse and also resolved during the recovery period.  
Toxicity studies in the monkey 
Fremanezumab was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at weekly IV injections up to 100 mg/kg for four 
weeks. No adverse findings were reported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 23/116 
  
  
 
In monkeys, in a 1 month SC study, total protein was slightly increased in the high dose group and corresponded 
to increased globulin levels. A minimal increase in lymphocytes was also noted at the end of treatment. None of 
these findings are considered to be toxicologically relevant and resolved during the recovery period. Likewise, 
minimal mononuclear cell infiltrates in brain are a common finding in Cynomolgus and not test article related. In 
the 3 month monkey study with fremanezumab, perivascular inflammation of ciliary vessels was noted in 3 
animals (one 300 mg/kg/wk IV male, one 300 mg/kg/wk SC male, and one 100 mg/kg/wk IV female). The 
inflammation was accompanied by increased monocytes and deposition of immune complexes (C3 complement, 
IgG and/or IgM). These findings were not reproduced in the 6 month study. Taken together, these findings are 
indicative of an immune response and are typical for a hypersensitivity reaction. Although adverse, the severity 
was low and because these types of immune responses are not predictive for the human population, the finding 
is adequately characterized and not otherwise relevant. In the 6 month repeat dose toxicity study with 
fremanezumab in monkeys, the only notable findings were perivascular monocellular cell infiltrates of minimal 
severity at the injection sites in females given 100 or 300 mg fremanezumab/kg/wk and slightly increased 
neutrophils in males given 300 mg fremanezumab/kg/wk. These findings are not considered to be toxicologically 
meaningful.  
All study groups were adequately exposed during the repeat dose toxicity studies. Toxicokinetic data are typical 
for  therapeutic  IgG  present  in  excess.  Anti-drug  antibodies  were  detected  in  all  studies  and  appeared  to 
influence  the  clearance  of  fremanezumab  from  serum  (see  pharmacokinetic  assessment).  Nevertheless,  the 
presence of ADA in animals assigned to study groups did not influence the safety assessment of fremanezumab. 
Exposure  multiples  (based  on  Cmax)  varied  from  2.3-43  for  i.v.  administrations  and  from  2.2-227  for  s.c. 
administrations. It is however noted that fremanezumab levels from single doses in humans are compared to 
levels from multiple dose studies in animals. Since accumulation was observed in the multiple dose studies in 
animals (1.8-9.1x), this could result in lower safety margins than the reported. 
Plasma concentrations increased approximately dose proportionally in the repeated dose toxicity studies with 
fremanezumab. At comparable s.c. doses, maximal plasma concentrations in the 6 month study were slightly 
higher  (1.5-4x)  compared  to  the  3  month  study  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  This  may  be  due  to  the  different 
formulations of fremanezumab used in these studies. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1).  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and a scientific advice. 
However, as fremanezumab is intended for long-term treatment, in line with ICH S6(R1) a carcinogenic risk 
assessment was provided. Based on this review, the carcinogenic risk for CGRP inhibition is considered low.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
A series of reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. All animals were sufficiently 
exposed during the study to allow a meaningful assessment of the reproductive toxicological potential of 
fremanezumab, with doses up to 200 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. There were no untoward 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 24/116 
  
  
 
 
effects on male or female fertility and mating performance in rats, or embryofoetal development in rats and 
rabbits. Fremanezumab was measured in foetal rat serum, with maximal levels in the 100 mg/kg dose group 
being approximately 9% of the maternal Cmax. Peri and postnatal development studies in rats revealed no 
fremanezumab related effects in either dams or pups.   
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated in the toxicology studies and in a separate study with male rabbits.  
Fremanezumab was well tolerated when administered by intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, perivenous 
or intramuscular route 
Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity study with human, cynomolgus, rabbit and rat tissue  
Specific reactions to the tissue were verified by using a negative and two positive controls. In general the 
staining pattern was comparable between human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and rabbit. Rather weak, specific 
staining of the human pituitary of one donor was detected, which was not observed in any of the animals. CGRP 
expression in the pituitary is supported by literature data; however, staining was cytoplasmic, thus it is unknown 
if fremanezumab will bind to this target in vivo. In addition, specific staining in cynomolgus monkey, rat and 
rabbit tissue was detected in parafollicular cells in the thyroid which are reported to express CGRP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment of fremanezumab was not conducted. As a monoclonal antibody, 
fremanezumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment as it is metabolised to aminoacids.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has presented non-clinical in vitro data to demonstrate the pharmacological mode of action for 
fremanezumab as a CGRP-inhibitor.  
Importantly, it was demonstrated that binding of fremanezumab to FcγR is low and that binding of CGRP to 
CGRPR1 is impaired by fremanezumab. Thus, fremanezumab does not exhibit Fc effector functions such as 
ADCC and CDC. No complete in vivo model of migraine exists, but some mechanistic and pain models have been 
conducted, suggesting that fremanezumab is effective in migraine prevention. 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. CGRP is a potent vasodilator with a wide expression 
in neuronal tissue. The applicant acknowledged that alterations in wound healing as well as increased skin 
inflammatory responses at the fremanezumab injection sites could theoretically be possible consequences of 
CGRP blockade with fremanezumab in humans and proposes to routine pharmacovigilance surveillance. Given 
the limited information on the clinical effects of CGRP blockade and its role in pregnancy, the applicant proposed 
to conduct a post-authorisation safety study to determine the possible effect of CGRP blockade during 
pregnancy. 
Antibodies against fremanezumab were observed in several of the studies, which, in some cases, did appear to 
affect exposure. The presence of clearing antibodies is also indicated by the single dose IV studies, in which 3/6 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019

monkeys and almost all rabbits showed an abnormal PK profile suggesting the presence of clearing ADA’s. There 
may  very  well  be  an  underestimation  of  the  ADAs  present  in  the  samples  as  the  plasma  fremanezumab 
concentrations in the tested samples were, in general, well above the provided drug-tolerance levels, inhibiting 
the detection of antibodies. The presence of neutralizing ADA’s is not assessed, although this is warranted since 
there is no PD marker used to demonstrate sustained activity in the in vivo toxicology studies. In addition, there 
seem to be some issues with the followed procedure and/or the assays of both fremanezumab and of antibodies 
against fremanezumab. Although the assays seem to be well validated, the presence of fremanezumab or ADA’s 
was observed in control and/or pre-dose samples in several of the studies. According to the applicant this could 
not be explained by assay variabilities nor by protocol deviations.  
The applicant has discussed the presence of clearing and/or possibly neutralizing antibodies. It is agreed that 
the methods used to detect ADA’s were adequate and the batches used in the pivotal and most recent 
repeated-dose as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were the most relevant. In these 
studies, presence of ADA’s seemed to be limited and exposure of fremanezumab was still sufficient. In addition, 
the level of ADA formation has a low predictive value for humans. Therefore, although there remain some 
questions with regard to the earlier studies, the assay limitations do not seem to have prevented an adequate 
assessment of the safety of fremanezumab in the more recent studies and the issue was considered resolved.  
To support the safety of fremanezumab, a toxicology programme in cynomolgus monkeys and rats was 
presented, which is in accordance with current guidance and considered adequate. The main findings only 
observed in the 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study were perivascular infiltrates in the eye and stifle joint of 
cynomolgus monkeys, but are considered as a result of an immune response and not otherwise relevant. 
Overall, the toxicity studies provide a sufficient safety margin to the exposure at the proposed clinical dose of 
fremanezumab. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and a scientific advice. 
However, as fremanezumab is intended for long-term treatment, in line with ICH S6(R1) a carcinogenicity risk 
assessment based on review of relevant data on CGRP functions from current literature has been provided. 
Based on this review, the carcinogenic risk for CGRP inhibition is considered low 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity was assessed in a fertility + EFD study in rats, a EFD study in rabbits 
and a PPND study in rats. These studies have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility and pregnancy 
outcome.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed clinical dose of fremanezumab is 225 mg once monthly (monthly dosing) or 675 mg every three 
months (quarterly dosing) as per patients preference.  
Of the seven studies contributing to the characterization of the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab, two phase 
1  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  with  dense  PK  sampling  were  primarily  designed  as  clinical  pharmacology 
studies.  In  study  LBR-101-011,  fremanezumab  was  administered  both  iv  and  sc  to  render  information  on 
bioavailability. In all other studies, fremanezumab was solely administered via the sc route. Pharmacokinetics in 
episodic and chronic migraine patients were investigated in two phase 2 efficacy and safety studies in patients 
with CM or EM (studies LBR-101-021 and LBR-101-022) and three phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (studies 
TV48125-CNS-30049,  TV48125-CNS-30050  and  TV48125-CNS-30051).  In  these  studies,  only  sparse  PK 
sampling was performed. In the studies with intensive PK data, non-compartmental PK analysis was conducted, 
while for the sparse PK data in migraine patients a population PK model was developed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 28/116 
  
  
 
 
 
Absorption  
Absolute bioavailability of fremanezumab after sc administration was approximately 54% to 57% from 
non-compartmental comparison of iv and sc administration of 225 mg and 900 mg single doses to healthy 
subjects. Based on the stepwise update of PPK modelling, bioavailability was estimated based on the same 
intensive PK data (Study LBR-101-011) to 65.8% in a model-based way. This value was fixed before adding 
further PK data from migraine patients. The applicant revised the wording on fremanezumab absolute 
bioavailability (F) in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to be based on both non-compartmental 
(NCA) and population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analyses. Due to the sparse data PK base, the characterization of 
absorption in terms of ka (high shrinkage and IIV) remains complex.  
Distribution and elimination 
Fremanezumab displayed PK parameters typical for therapeutic antibodies. Volume of distribution over F (Vc/F) 
was in the range of 5.7 – 6.4 L, indicating limited tissue penetration and distribution mainly in serum after sc 
administration. Fremanezumab half-life was estimated to 30 days and linear clearance over F (CL/F) was 
estimated to 0.141 L/day. Since monoclonal antibodies are known to be mainly eliminated via intracellular 
proteolysis, renal or hepatic elimination pathways are negligible. 
The updated population PK analysis resulted in a rough estimate of 66% for bioavailability based on limited data 
for healthy subjects. Assuming that this model-derived estimate holds for the patient population, the volume of 
distribution was 3.6 L and central clearance was 0.09 L/day for a typical subject following subcutaneous 
administration of 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg of fremanezumab. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the single dose studies in healthy subjects, slightly greater than dose-proportional increases in 
fremanezumab exposure with increasing doses was shown. However, the deviation was minimal and patient 
numbers quite small. The PPK analysis subsequently revealed overlapping dose-normalized AUC and Cmax for 
the different fremanezumab doses investigated, thereby indicating dose-proportionality. 
After multiple dosing of fremanezumab, the median accumulation ratios for once-monthly and once-quarterly 
dosing regimen were estimated to 2.34-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively. Exposure simulations indicated that 
steady state following both 225 mg monthly and 675 mg quarterly dosing was reached after 168 days, which 
approx. corresponds to 5 half-lifes of fremanezumab. 
Variability 
Estimated IIV was larger for ka (54.8 %SEM) compared to CL/F (29.0 %SEM) and Vc/F (22.7 %SEM). Large IIV 
for the absorption rate is acceptable as mainly sparse PK samples and few iv data have been included in the 
population PK analysis data set.  
Overall, VPC plots indicate no major deviation. The high variability of the data is captured in the model. The 
variability however remains unexplained as besides body weight, no other covariate could be identified by 
population PK data analysis including injection sites.   
The Applicant provided information on the inter-individual variation and calculated the intra-individual variability 
in Cmax,ss, Cav,ss, and AUCss following dosing with 225 mg fremanezumab once monthly and 675 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 29/116 
  
  
 
fremanezumab every 3 months. There was no difference in inter-individual variation between the once monthly 
and once quarterly dosing regimen. The intra-individual variability in Cmax,ss; Cav,ss and AUCss was low, as 
expected for monoclonal antibodies injected via the SC route. 
Special populations 
Fremanezumab  is  not  expected  to  be  eliminated  via  renal  or  hepatic  pathways  and  therefore  no  studies  in 
subjects with impaired renal or hepatic function are obligatory.  
In the PPK model, body weight was demonstrated to have a significant influence on CL and V:  
Relative  to  a  71-kg  subject  (the  median  weight  in  the  population),  a  51-kg  subject  and  a  101-kg  subject 
(corresponding to the 5th and 95th percentile of body weights observed in the analysis dataset) are expected to 
have approximately 32% lower and 52% higher CL/F and a 25% lower and 36% higher Vc/F, respectively.  
No  other  significant  covariates  were  identified,  concluding  that  no  relevant  differences  in  fremanezumab 
exposure were detected among different sex, race or age groups.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug interaction studies have been performed with fremanezumab, which was formerly agreed to by both 
FDA and EMA, since interaction with CYP450 enzymes is considered unlikely with monoclonal antibodies of high 
molecular weight. 
In  the  PPK  analysis,  the  impact  of  concomitantly  administered  migraine  medications  on  fremanezumab 
exposure was investigated. Overall, exposure ranges were demonstrated to be comparable in the presence or 
absence  of  co-medication.  Ergotamine/triptan  use  was  not  found  to  be  a  significant  covariate  in  the  PPK 
analysis. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fremanezumab is a potent, selective anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. It blocks both the α- and β-CGRP isoforms 
from binding to the CGRP receptor and does not bind to the closely related amylin, calcitonin, or adrenomedullin 
peptides. Introduction of 2 mutations into the constant region of the fremanezumab heavy chain limits antibody 
effector functions, thereby preventing fremanezumab from stimulating antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity and triggering complement-mediated lysis (Armour 1999, Zeller 2008). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The binding of fremanezumab to its targets (CGRP) has been characterized in non-human models. 
Fremanezumab prevents in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate production induced by CGRP while not 
binding to similar peptides such as amylin, calcitonin, or adrenomedullin.

Three studies addressing cardiac safety have been conducted and have collected ECGs in a well-controlled 
environment in rigorous fashion within the therapeutic dosing range. No specific PD studies regarding efficacy 
endpoints have been provided. Thus, pharmacodynamic endpoints with regard to efficacy evaluated in terms of 
monthly number of migraine days are difficult to be precisely correlated with fremanezumab exposure. Based on 
the chosen study program and achieved PK/PD results, the rationale for dose selection remains vague. 
Regarding exposure-efficacy analysis, exploratory analyses and exposure-response models have been provided 
relating Cav and change from baseline migraine days for both patient groups EM and CM.  
Overall, no clear relationship between doses/exposure and response is indicated. Following fremanezumab 
treatment, an additional but comparable decrease in migraine days in addition to a quite strong placebo 
response could be detected from the data and model-based analyses.  
Bodyweight was shown to have an appreciable impact on fremanezumab PK. According to simulation results, in 
each of the dosing regimen, except for placebo treatment, there was a trend in greater efficacy in CM patients 
at lower body weight. No trend was indicated regarding EM patients. 
Exposure response analysis based von Phase 2 and Phase 3 data with regard to the safety endpoints abnormal 
heart rate and abnormal systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not indicate a clinical relevant relationship 
between exposure metrics and safety endpoints. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In total, 7 studies were conducted in support of the characterization of the PK properties of fremanezumab. 
The analytical methods used for detection of fremanezumab and anti-drug antibodies in human serum were 
adequately validated and in line with the recent guidance.  
A population PK model was developed for the characterization of fremanezumab PK in migraine patients. No 
major deviations were identified and the model can be considered adequate. The PK parameters estimates 
deriving from the PPK analysis were mainly consistent with findings from previous analyses of fremanezumab 
pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and other monoclonal antibodies. As an update of population PK 
description, iv and long term PK data were included in the modelling process. In this line, a two-compartment 
model has been selected and F was estimated based on limited iv and sc PK data.  
Steady state exposure estimated for migraine patients was demonstrated to be comparable to PK in in healthy 
subjects. Similarly, half-life estimated by PPK analysis was similar to half-life determined after single dose 
administration of fremanezumab in healthy subjects. However, for the 675 mg quarterly dose regimen, median 
AUCinf determined by non-compartmental analysis in healthy subjects appears to be twice as high as median 
AUC(0-84d) estimated in the PPK model. In response, the applicant clarified there was a unit error and the 
values presented for the PPK model were for AUC0-28d instead of AUC0-84d. 
The PK of fremanezumab was described to be dose-proportional without any indication of time-dependent 
changes.  
The impact of liver function on fremanezumab exposure was investigated in the PPK model, revealing no 
significant differences in exposure of patients with normal liver function vs. mild or moderate liver function

impairment. However, given the possibility that monoclonal antibodies may be cleared by damaged kidneys due 
to proteinurea, section 5.2 of the SmPC includes a statement that patients with severe renal impairment have 
not been studied. 
The body weight effect on fremanezumab exposure is reflected in the SmPC, although body weight did not seem 
to have an effect on clinical efficacy in patients with body weight up to 132 kg. Since no data are available on 
patients with body weight > 132 kg, it is unknown whether the plasma levels in these patients are sufficiently 
high to have a clinically significant effect. This uncertainty was reflected in the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity of fremanezumab in both healthy subjects and migraine patients was very low (0.4 – 1.6%), 
which was confirmed by long-term data from the extension study. 
No analysis of primary or secondary pharmacology (e.g. CGRP, capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow) was 
conducted. Conclusively, the pharmacodynamic proof of concept in humans was not demonstrated in clinical 
studies. 
The exposure-efficacy analysis revealed no clear relationship between average fremanezumab concentration 
achieved with different dose regimen and respective reduction in monthly number of migraine/headache days. 
Thus, the rationale for dose selection from this perspective remains vague. In addition, long-term data beyond 
3 months of treatment are required to elucidate the presence or absence of changes in response after reaching 
a steady state fremanezumab concentration.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab has been adequately characterized. PK and immunogenicity data from the 
long-term roll-over extension study were provided.  
Although the PK data set for PPK analyses has been enlarged, the new PPK model structure, parameter 
estimates, and the necessity of fixing of central PK parameters indicate some model deficiencies in describing iv 
and sc data simultaneously. 
The only data provided regarding pharmacodynamic properties of fremanezumab was the exposure-efficacy 
analysis which investigated the effect of fremanezumab exposure on reduction of monthly number of 
migraine/headache days. The absence of further PD measures is considered adequately justified.  
Exposure response analysis based von Phase 2 and Phase 3 data with regard to the safety endpoints abnormal 
heart rate and abnormal systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not indicate a clinical relevant relationship 
between exposure metrics and safety endpoints. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of fremanezumab was evaluated in 3 Phase 3 studies, hereof 2 highly similar designed 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (study 30049 in chronic migraine and study 30050 in episodic 
migraine) and 1 long-term, double-blind safety study (study 30051), the latter ongoing at the time of 
submission of this Marketing Authorization Application. 
Supportive data come from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b studies (study 021 and study 022).

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 021 was a phase 2b study in patients with chronic migraine (CM). 264 patients were randomly assigned 
to receive 3 monthly sc doses of either: 
- placebo  
- fremanezumab 900 mg or 
- fremanezumab 225 mg (with a starting dose of  675 mg). 
As the phase 3 studies, study 021 consisted of a 28-day run-in period and a 12-week treatment period, including 
a final evaluation at week 12. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Main duration of 
migraine diagnosis was 20.4, 15.8, and 18.8 years for placebo, fremanezumab 675/225/225 mg, and 
fremanezumab 900/900/900 mg, respectively. A slight majority of patients was not using migraine preventive 
medication (57%, 60%, and 62% for placebo, fremanezumab 675/225/225 mg, and fremanezumab 
900/900/900 mg, respectively). The average age of patients was 40.8 years (range 18 to 65 years), with the 
majority of patients being women (86%) and White. Based on this distribution of age, disease history and 
female preponderance, the study population is considered representative for the group of patients with migraine 
being candidates for preventive migraine treatment. 
Primary endpoint of this study was change in monthly cumulative headache hours of any severity, assessed at 
week 12. This choice of endpoint is agreed for a population with CM. Chronic headaches often become more 
featureless over time, and patients with CM -in addition to typical migraine attacks- may present with headache 
attacks that do not fulfil the criteria of migraine. This is why the definition of CM is based on headaches on at 
least 15 days per month of which more than eight are migrainous.  
Indeed, the primary endpoint (cumulative headache hours of any severity) was found to be reduced at week 12 
in all three treatment groups, but in favour of the two fremanezumab regimens over placebo (MMRM results): 
-37.10, -59.84, and -67.51 hours for placebo, fremanezumab 675/225/225, and fremanezumab 900/900/900, 
respectively. The difference from placebo was statistically significant for both fremanezumab treatment groups. 
Superiority in this endpoint was also found for month 1 and month 2, indicating a rapid onset of treatment effect. 
However, despite statistical significance, a difference over placebo of 22.74 hours (fremanezumab 675/225/225 
mg), and 30.41 hours (fremanezumab 900/900/900 mg) equate approximately one day and is not considered 
a really huge treatment effect given the absolute number of headache hours at baseline in this population. 
A statistical significant, but in clinical terms moderate treatment effect over placebo was also found with the 
secondary efficacy endpoint “number of headache days of at least moderate severity (-4.2, -6.04, and -6.16 
days at week 12 for placebo, fremanezumab 675/225/225/, and fremanezumab 900/900/900 mg, respectively 
[FAS], indicating a difference of less than 2 days). 
The primary analysis indicated a slightly better treatment effect of fremanezumab 900/900/900 mg compared 
with the lower dose of 675/225/225 mg.

Study Participants  
TV48125-CNS-30049 (Chronic Migraine) 
This study included female and male patients, aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive, with a history of migraine for at 
least 12 months and CM (as defined by ICHD-3 criteria [Headache Classification Committee of the IHS 2013]). 
The diagnosis was prospectively confirmed via a review of headache data recorded daily during a 28-day run-in 
period in an electronic headache diary device. 
A subset of patients (specified in the protocol not to exceed 30%) were allowed to use 1 concomitant migraine 
preventive medication, and no changes in these medications were allowed until the last study assessments were 
completed. All other patients were not using concomitant preventive migraine medications at the time of the 
screening visit, and they were not allowed to initiate these medications after study start. Patients were allowed 
to use acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks as needed. 
TV48125-CNS-30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
The study population was composed of men and women, 18 to 70 years of age (inclusive), with a history of 
migraine (as defined by ICHD-3 criteria [Headache Classification Committee of the IHS 2013]) for at least 12

months prior to screening and EM prospectively documented via a review of headache data recorded daily during 
a 28-day run-in period in an electronic headache diary device. 
TV48125-CNS-30051 (LTS) 
The study included female and male patients 18 through 70 years of age with CM and EM who completed the 
pivotal efficacy studies (Studies TV48125-CNS-30049 and TV48125-CNS-30050) and approximately 300 
patients (approximately half of whom had a diagnosis of CM and half of whom had a diagnosis of EM as defined 
by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition [ICHD-3] criteria [Headache Classification 
Committee of the IHS 2013]) who had not participated in the pivotal efficacy studies. In addition, patients who 
had not completed the pivotal efficacy studies and patients who completed the pivotal efficacy studies but did 
not wish to continue treatment during this long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy study could attend a 
follow-up visit during this study for the purpose of ADA assessment approximately 7.5 months after their last 
dose of study drug during the pivotal efficacy study.

Outcomes/endpoints   
TV48125-CNS-30049 (Chronic Migraine) and TV48125-CNS-30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
Primary efficacy variable 
Primary efficacy variables of the two pivotal studies were monthly average number of headache days of at least 
moderate severity (study 30049), and monthly average number of migraine days (study 30050), respectively. 
Data were derived from headache information collected daily using an electronic headache diary device. 
Secondary efficacy variables 
The secondary variables including monthly average number of migraine days, average number of headache 
days, average number of headache days of at least moderate severity, and monthly average number of days of 
use of use of any acute headache medications, migraine related disability were also derived from daily collected 
information using the electronic headache diary. 
Study 30049: 
The HIT-6, a short form for assessing the adverse headache impact in clinical practice (social functioning, role 
functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, and psychological distress) was  conducted at pre-specified time 
points. Scores range from 36 to 78, where a higher score indicates a greater impact of headache on the daily life 
of the patient, i.e., scores ≤49 represent little or no impact, scores between 50 and 55 represent some impact, 
scores between 56 and 59 represent substantial impact; and scores ≥60 indicate severe impact (Bayliss and 
Batenhorst 2002). 
Study 30050: 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 38/116 
  
  
 
 
 
Headache-related disability was assessed using the MIDAS questionnaire, a 5-item instrument based on lost 
days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and non-work) over the previous 3 months (Stewart et al 
1999). The total of the scores of the first 5 questions is used for grading of disability, with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 
10, 11 to 20, and ≥21 interpreted as disability grades 1 (little or no disability), 2 (mild disability), 3 (moderate 
disability), and 4 (severe disability), respectively. 
Patients completed the MIDAS questionnaire at pre-specified time points 
Exploratory efficacy measures and variables 
Exploratory efficacy variables (monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity, 
monthly average number of headache days of any severity, monthly average number of migraine days, monthly 
average number of headache hours of any severity, monthly average number of headache hours of at least 
moderate severity, monthly average number of days of use of migraine-specific acute headache medications, 
monthly average number of days with nausea or vomiting, and monthly average number of days with 
photophobia and phonophobia) were also derived from headache information collected daily using the electronic 
headache diary. 
Additional exploratory variables included changes in quality of life, health status, depression status, work 
productivity and activity impairment, and patient satisfaction with treatment. Measures for these exploratory 
efficacy variables included the MSQOL, EQ-5D-5L, PHQ-2/PHQ-9, WPAI, and PGIC. 
TV48125-CNS-30051 (LTS) 
There was no primary or secondary efficacy measure in this study. 
Exploratory efficacy measures and variables 
Exploratory efficacy variables (monthly average number of migraine days, headache days of at least moderate 
severity, headache days of any severity, days of use of any acute headache medications, headache hours of at 
least moderate severity, headache hours of any severity, days with nausea or vomiting, and days with 
photophobia and phonophobia during the 4-week periods after visits 2, 3, 4, 7, and 13 for months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 
12) were derived from headache information collected daily using the electronic headache diary. 
Additional exploratory variables included changes in quality of life, health status, adverse headache impact on 
daily living, headache related disability, depression status, work productivity and activity impairment, and 
patient satisfaction with treatment. Measures for these exploratory efficacy variables included the HIT, MIDAS, 
MSQOL, EQ-5D-5L, PHQ-2/PHQ-9, WPAI, and PGIC. 
Sample size 
TV48125-CNS-30049 (Chronic Migraine) 
In a Phase 3 study in CM patients, a treatment difference of 1.7 days of monthly average headache days of at 
least moderate severity between the TEV-48125 675/225/225 mg and placebo treatment groups was observed 
at month 3. A sample size of 867 patients (i.e., 289 evaluable patients completing the study per treatment 
group) results in at least 90% power for the study to succeed (assuming a common standard deviation [SD] of 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 39/116 
  
  
 
 
 
6.29 days) at an alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 15% discontinuation rate, 340 patients per treatment group 
were to be randomized. 
TV48125-CNS-30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
A total of 768 patients were planned to be randomized in this study to have 675 completers (225 completers per 
treatment group); a 12% drop-out rate was anticipated. A sample size of 675 patients (ie, 225 evaluable 
patients completing the study per treatment group) will provide 90% power to detect a 1.6 difference in 
migraine days between an active arm (monthly TEV-48125 225mg or  TEV-48125 675mg followed by monthly 
placebo) and placebo arm at an alpha level of 0.05, assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 5.2 days. 
TV48125-CNS-30051 (LTS) 
There are no statistical considerations for this sample size. A total of 1842 patients (867 patients from Study 
TV48125-CNS-30049, 675 patients from Study TV48125-30050, and approximately 300 patients who did not 
participate in the pivotal efficacy studies) were planned for enrolment, and a 30% drop-out rate was anticipated. 
Randomisation 
TV48125-CNS-30049 (Chronic Migraine) 
Eligible patients were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a loading dose of TEV-48125 at 675 mg 
followed by monthly TEV-48125 at 225 mg, TEV-48125 at 675 mg followed by monthly placebo, or monthly 
placebo. Randomization was to be stratified by gender, country, and baseline preventive medication use (yes, 
no). 
TV48125-CNS-30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
Eligible patients were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of the 2 TEV-48125 dose regimens or 
placebo with stratification based on gender, country, and baseline preventive medication use (yes, no).  
Long-Term Study TV48125-CNS-30051 (Chronic Migraine & Episodic Migraine) 
Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who were randomized to the active treatment groups were 
to be continue receiving the same treatment throughout the study. Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy 
studies who received placebo and patients not rolling over will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
quarterly TEV-48125 at 675 mg or monthly TEV-48125 at 225 mg (Note: Patients with CM will receive a 675-mg 
loading dosing at visit 2 and TEV-48125 at 225 mg at each subsequent visit.). Patients were to be stratified by 
gender, country, and baseline preventive medication use (yes, no) during the pivotal efficacy studies or this 
study if they are not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), and patients were to 
be blinded to treatment assignment. The personnel responsible for bioanalysis were not to have access to 
clinical safety and efficacy data and were to provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that 
would not identify individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier was to be linked to an individual patient’s 
concentration data).

Statistical methods 
Efficacy studies (TV48125-CNS-30049 - Chronic Migraine & TV48125-CNS-30050 - Episodic Migraine) 
Analysis sets 
In both studies, four analysis sets were defined: ITT set (all randomized patients, as randomized), safety set 
(patients who received at least one dose, as treated), FAS (ITT set with at least one dose and 1 post-baseline 
efficacy assessment), and PP set (completers without any violations of the inclusion/exclusion criteria or any 
violations or omissions of the drug administration). 
The FAS was to be the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Statistical analyses 
In Study 30049 (Chronic Migraine), the primary efficacy endpoint (PE) was defined as the mean change from 
baseline (28-day run-in period) in the monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity 
during the 12-week period after the 1st dose of study drug. The primary endpoint was to be analysed using an 
analysis of covariance method. The model included treatment, gender, country, and baseline preventive 
medication use as fixed effects and baseline number of headache days of at least moderate severity and years 
since onset of migraines as covariates. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be constructed for the least 
squares mean differences between each TEV-48125 group and the placebo group. A hierarchical procedure was 
to be used to control type 1 error rate. The primary comparison is between the monthly TEV-48125 dose and 
placebo. 
In Study 30050 (Episodic Migraine), the primary efficacy endpoint (PE) was the mean change from baseline 
(28-day run-in period) in the monthly average number of migraine days during the 12-week period after the 1st 
dose of study drug. The primary endpoint was to be analysed using the same analysis of covariance method as 
specified for chronic migraine. A hierarchical procedure was to be used to control type 1 error rate. However, the 
primary comparison was not specified in the protocol. 
For both studies, a MMRM model for monthly migraine days was specified in the SAP as supplemental analysis. 
The MMRM model was to include baseline value, treatment, sex, region, baseline preventive migraine 
medication use (yes/no), years since onset of migraines, month and treatment-by-month interaction as fixed 
effects, and patient in the repeated statement as a random effect. The unconstructed covariance structure (sic!) 
was to be used for the repeated observations within a patient. LS means for the treatment groups, LS means for 
the treatment differences (TEV-48125 - placebo), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and associated 
p-values were to be calculated by month and for the overall treatment period. 
Missing values 
Per the SAP, missing values were to be neglected if more than 10 observations existed. In detail, if a patient had 
≥10 days of the e-diary data after 1st dose of the study drug, his/her monthly average number of days/hours of 
efficacy variables during the 12-week period were to be prorated to 28 days and set to missing otherwise. For 
monthly efficacy values, the same algorithm was to be used if ≥ 10 / < 10 entries within the respective month 
existed. 
Long-Term Safety Study (TV48125-CNS-30051 - Chronic Migraine & Episodic Migraine) 
The same analysis sets as for the pivotal efficacy studies were used with an additional ADA only data set 
containing all patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA assessment only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019

This study is a long-term safety study. Efficacy is an exploratory endpoint and as such only analysed 
descriptively. Missing values will be treated as in the pivotal efficacy studies.

Title: 
A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study comparing 
the efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens of subcutaneous administration of fremanezumab 
(TEV-48125) versus placebo for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine 
Study identifier 
TV48125-CNS-30049  
Design 
16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 dose 
regimens of sc fremanezumab and placebo in adults with CM. The study consisted 
of a screening visit, a 28-day run-in period, and a 12-week (84-day) treatment 
period, including a final evaluation at week 12 (end-of-treatment [EOT] visit, 
approximately 4 weeks [28 days] after the final dose of study drug).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No true across trials analyses have been performed.  
Comparing within each study (i.e. by treatment group) and across the studies, the patient populations were 
consistent with an adult migraine population and were generally similar with respect to age, weight, racial 
composition, and ethnic composition. The majority of patients in both studies were women, consistent with the 
observed gender distribution within the global adult migraine population. 
Within each study, the treatment groups were similar in regard to the time since initial migraine diagnosis. The 
time since initial migraine diagnosis in patients was approximately 20 years in both Study 30049 and Study 
30050. 
In Study 30049 and Study 30050, the number of patients using preventive medications at baseline (21% overall 
in each study) was comparable across the treatment groups. In Study 30049, the most frequently reported 
preventive medications were topiramate, amitriptyline, and valproate. In Study 30050, topiramate was reported 
most frequently. 
Supportive study(ies) 
LBR-101-022 
The primary and secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the number of monthly treated with 
TEV-48125 for 12 weeks (2 dose regimens: monthly 675 mg or monthly 225 mg) in comparison with placebo. 
Exploratory objectives were to evaluate the number of headache hours and headache days of different severity 
levels, the number of days with nausea or vomiting, the number of days with photophobia and phonophobia, as 
well as consumption of headache acute medications and migraine-related disability with TEV-48125 treatment. 
A statistically significant difference in favor of TEV-48125 was observed for both the high and low TEV-48125 
dose regimens in comparison with placebo for the primary endpoint, that is, change from baseline in monthly 
migraine days at month 3. Improvements were evident as early as 1 month after administration of the first dose 
of TEV-48125. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 68/116 
  
  
 
 
 
At month 3, statistically significant differences in favor of TEV-48125 were also observed in regard to the 
number of days with headache of any severity (ie, secondary objective); fewer headache days were reported 
with both the high and low TEV-48125 dose regimens than with placebo. 
Analyses of the exploratory endpoints showed similar improvements: reductions were observed in the number 
of headache days with headache of at least moderate severity, the number of hours with headache of moderate 
or severe intensity, the number of hours with headache of any severity, the number of days with photophobia 
and phonophobia, and the number of days using acute headache medication in patients treated with both the 
high and low dose regimen of TEV-48125 in comparison with placebo throughout the study. Initial improvement 
in comparison with placebo was observed in the 675-mg treatment group in regard to the number of days with 
nausea or vomiting, whereas treatment with 225 mg resulted in improvement compared to placebo throughout 
the study. Migraine-related disability, as assessed by the MIDAS questionnaire, showed that high and low dose 
TEV-48125 decreased migraine-related disability in comparison with placebo. 
Ad hoc analysis of the primary efficacy variable showed that more patients reported at least 50% reduction in 
monthly migraine days in the TEV-48125 treatment groups than in the placebo group during the study. 
Ad hoc analysis based on preventive migraine medication use demonstrated that TEV-48125 treatment is 
efficacious with and without the use of preventive migraine medication. Ad hoc analysis of patients using 
triptans at baseline showed similar results; decreases in the number of days using triptans to treat headaches 
in the TEV-48125 treatment groups in comparison with the placebo group were observed throughout the study. 
PK analysis of trough plasma concentrations of TEV-48125 indicated that steady state levels were not achieved 
following 3 months of monthly TEV-48125 dosing at 675-mg and 225-mg dose levels. Comparison of the trough 
concentrations on Days 29, 57, and 85 relative to dose indicated that exposure increased with increasing dose 
in a manner that appears to be proportional. 
In conclusion, patients in this study treated with TEV-48125 showed clinical improvement in HFEM, which was 
maintained throughout the 3-month duration of the study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
Study 30049 (Chronic Migraine) 
The study design, study endpoints/objectives and doses tested are considered acceptable. However, the 
extremely short study duration with a treatment phase of only 16 weeks (which equates only 1 to 3 study drug 
administrations) is considered not optimal. Fremanezumab is intended for migraine prophylaxis and hence is 
thought to be used as a chronic treatment for months or even years. In order to gain such long-term data on 
safety and efficacy the Applicant decided to conduct a separate, long-term safety and efficacy study, study 
30051. However, this long-term trial did not include a placebo-control which to some extend limits the validity 
of efficacy evaluations. 
The inclusion criteria are considered acceptable to define a typical migraine population and are overall 
supported.  However, the Applicant’s initial intention to claim for the broad indication “prevention of episodic and 
chronic migraine in adults”, which would have included all stages of severity of the disease and all age groups, 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 69/116 
  
  
 
was critically reviewed and discussed during the authorisation process, and as a result the Applicant chose to 
restrict the target indication to patients with at least 4 migraine days per month. In addition a statement on the 
limited data in patients > 60 years of age was included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Study 30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
The study design, study endpoints/objectives and doses tested are considered acceptable.  
However, as for study 30049 the extremely short study duration with a treatment phase of only 16 weeks (which 
equates only 1 to 3 study drug administrations) is considered not optimal. Moreover, the same shortcomings as 
for study 30049 had also been raised for study 30050 during the authorisation process, namely the exclusion of 
patients > 65 years and of patients with significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. In addition, 
patient with EM were only eligible if the number of headache days at baseline was in the range of ≥6 and ≤14 
days, with hereof ≥4 migraine days, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for migraine or probable migraine. As has 
been discussed above, the Applicant opted to restrict the indication to patients with at least 4 migraine days per 
month and to include statements on the limited data in patients > 60 years of age, both of which were 
considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Study 30051 (Long-term study in EM and CM) 
The study included female and male patients 18 through 70 years of age with CM and EM who completed the 
pivotal efficacy studies (Studies TV48125-CNS-30049 and TV48125-CNS-30050) and approximately 300 
patients (approximately half of whom had a diagnosis of CM and half of whom had a diagnosis of EM) who had 
not participated in the pivotal efficacy studies. In addition, patients who had not completed the pivotal efficacy 
studies and patients who completed the pivotal efficacy studies but did not wish to continue treatment during 
this long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy study could attend a follow-up visit during this study for the 
purpose of ADA assessment approximately 7.5 months after their last dose of study drug during the pivotal 
efficacy study. 
Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who were randomized to the active treatment groups were 
to be continued receiving the same treatment throughout the study. Patients rolling over from the pivotal 
efficacy studies who received placebo and patients not rolling over were to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive quarterly TEV-48125 at 675 mg or monthly TEV-48125 at 225 mg (with CM patients receiving a 
675-mg loading dosing at visit 2 and TEV-48125 at 225 mg at each subsequent visit.) 
The study design, study endpoints/objectives and doses tested are considered acceptable. Due to the concept of 
this study as a long-term extension trial for patients of the parental studies 30049 and 30050 the same 
objections with regard to study population as have been discussed for these studies apply. 
In addition, given the extremely short study duration of only 3 months of the pivotal studies (30049 and 30050), 
and given that fremanezumab is intended as a chronic migraine preventive treatment to be administered over 
months or even years, it would have been expected that an efficacy measure be evaluated as co-primary or at 
least secondary endpoint. This is not the case and the lack of a placebo control in this study might be the reason 
that efficacy was only assessed in the context of exploratory endpoints. This is a clear missed opportunity for 
this LTS. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints are in accordance to previous scientific advices and international 
guidelines on migraine research. For both pivotal phase 3 studies the CHMP recommended the inclusion of an 
active comparator arm in scientific advices. The Applicant has opted not to follow up this advice, arguing that the 
choice of active comparator would be difficult as not all drugs for migraine prophylaxis were available in all EU 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 70/116 
  
  
 
countries. The side-effect profiles of currently approved drugs (such as topiramate) and differences in routes of 
administration (for example botox) would further impact blinding. As no active comparator arm was included in 
the studies, the Applicant was requested to perform an exercise in comparative efficacy of versus existing 
therapies. This exercise was not included in the submitted dossier. The Applicant was therefore requested to 
perform such exercise to allow the placing of fremanezumab in the therapeutic window of currently approved 
migraine prophylaxis treatment. The Applicant provided an indirect comparison of the efficacy/safety profiles of 
fremanezumab, onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) and topiramate as requested. Taken together, the effect size of 
fremanezumab is comparable to that of these products while the safety profile of fremanezumab appeared even 
more favourable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 30049 (Chronic Migraine) 
Of the 1130 subjects in the ITT population (i.e., who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP), 1121 
patients (>99%) were evaluable for efficacy. 1034 patients (92%) completed the study. Baseline characteristics 
regarding sex and age were rather typical for a migraine population with a mean age of the patients of 41.3 
years (range 18 to 71 years) and the majority being women (88%). 
The primary endpoint was met and statistical significance for the mean reduction of monthly average number of 
headache days of at least moderate severity was demonstrated for both doses of fremanezumab compared to 
placebo. This superiority in treatment effect was demonstrated as early as 1 month after administration of the 
1st dose, and this difference was maintained at month 2 and month 3 for both active treatment groups. 
ANCOVA results showed an LS mean difference from placebo of -1.8 days for 675 mg/placebo/placebo and -2.1 
days for 675/225/225 mg. 
Results of the MMRM analysis of the mean change from baseline in headache days of at least moderate severity 
for  the  PP  analysis  were  similar,  showing  that  fremanezumab  treatment  resulted  in  a  larger  reduction  from 
baseline in the average number of headache days of at least moderate severity compared with placebo during 
the complete treatment period. 
Significant differences from placebo were also found for all secondary endpoint comparisons in favor of 
fremanzumab. 
The statistical methods planned in the protocol are considered overall acceptable. A display of missing eDiary 
data per patient was lacking at time of the initial MAA and was therefore requested to be submitted. Based on 
the data subsequently submitted the rate of missing diary entries was relatively low (5.94 to 7.41 days were 
missing over the whole 12 week period in study 30049; 7.11 to 7.69 in study 30050). So, although in certain 
patients  up  to  100%  missing  diary  entries  was  recognized  and  compliance  steeply  dropped  the  longer  the 
duration of the study, the overall rate of missing data seemed to not have impacted study results substantially. 
The hierarchical approach to control for multiplicity is in general endorsed. Although the sequence of endpoints 
(especially when compared for monthly and quarterly dosing) was found to be rather erratic, this did not impact 
study results.

TV48125-CNS-30050 (Episodic Migraine) 
Of the 874 subjects in the ITT population (i.e., who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP), 865 
patients (99%) were evaluable for efficacy. 791 patients (90%) completed the study and 686 patients (78%) 
rolled into the long-term safety study 30051. The mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range 18 to 70 
years). The majority of patients were White (80%) and women (85%). 
The primary endpoint was met and statistical significance for the mean change from baseline in the monthly 
average number of migraine days during the 12-week period after the 1st dose of study drug, demonstrated for 
both doses of fremanezumab compared to placebo. 
Albeit statistically significant, the absolute difference over placebo treatment was only modest. With 
fremanezumab the mean reduction was 3.9 and 4.0 migraine days for the 675-mg/placebo/placebo and 
225/225/225-mg treatment groups, respectively; in the placebo treatment group, a mean reduction of 2.6 
migraine days was observed, which equates a LS mean difference versus placebo of only -1.3 migraine days for 
675 mg/placebo/placebo and -1.5 migraine days for 225/225/225 mg (ANCOVA results). Although this reflects 
an only modest superiority over placebo, the beneficial treatment effect was consistently shown across all 
patient subgroups. 
Only modest superiority versus placebo was also found with regard to secondary efficacy analysis. 
The statistical methods planned in the protocol are considered acceptable.  As was discussed for study 30049 the 
rate of missing diary entries was relatively low and therefore seemed not to have substantially impacted study 
results.  In the same manner, the hierarchical sequence of endpoints was rather erratic than well-founded.  
Study 30051 (Long-term study in EM and CM) 
Of the 1889 subjects in the ITT population (i.e., who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP), 1887 
patients (>99%) were evaluable for safety. The mean age of the patients was 43.1 years (range 18 to 71 years) 
with the majority of patients being women (88%). At the time of the initial MAA data for only 16 patients (<1%), 
hereof 8 with CM and 8 with EM, who had completed the study had been presented.  
With the additional data long-term data submitted with their responses, the Applicant could demonstrate that 
the treatment effect observed during the first three treatment months was sustained over the whole study 
duration of up to 15 months. For CM patients treated with 225 mg monthly, the mean change in monthly number 
of migraine days from baseline to month 1 was -6.7 days for new/placebo rollover patients and -6.4 days for 
active rollover patients. For CM patients treated with 675 mg quarterly, the mean change in monthly number of 
migraine days from baseline to month 1 was -5.9 days for new/placebo rollover patients and -6.2 days for active 
rollover patients. For EM patients treated with 225 mg monthly, the mean change in monthly number of 
migraine days from baseline to month 1 was -4.7 days for new/placebo rollover patients and -4.5 days for active 
rollover patients. For EM patients treated with 675 mg quarterly, the mean change in monthly number of 
migraine days from baseline to month 1 was -5.3 days for new/placebo rollover patients and -4.6 days for active 
rollover patients. 
As the effect of baseline severity on efficacy was not completely clear with the initially submitted analyses, the 
Sponsor was requested to assess the effect of baseline migraine frequency on efficacy. The Applicant provided 
most of the requested analyses which show that no relevant effect modification based on baseline disease 
severity exists. It is noted that according to the displayed data patients with less than 8 migraine days at 
baseline showed a higher improvement than patients with more than 8 days. The lowest treatment benefit in 
patients with EM was observed in the intermediate group (> 8 to 12 migraine days at baseline) in both dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 72/116 
  
  
 
groups. For episodic migraine, patients with lower baseline disease severity in tendency also showed a higher 
benefit, although not to the same extend and not in all groups.  
Clinical implications of the primary endpoints 
In the main studies 7 patient reported outcomes (PRO’s) were evaluated as secondary (MIDAS and HIT-6) and 
exploratory (MSQoL, PGIC, EQ-5D-5L, PHQ-9, WPAI). Most of the questionnaires evaluated disease disability 
and some quality of life. 
The  Applicant  states  that  the  differences  between  the  EM  and  CM  studies  are  likely  to  be  explained  by  the 
baseline severity between the 2 conditions, as well as how broad or specific the PRO measure is. 
Some of the questionnaires only provide a very general score that is not migraine specific, which may lead to a 
more variable outcome and are difficult to interpret.  
The reported baseline values for the PRO’s are displayed in table 2. It can be seen that patients with CM have an 
overall  worse  score  at  baseline  (indicating  more  disability)  than  patients  with  EM.  This  is  an  indication  that 
patients with CM rate their disease as more severe than patients EM. This will have likely translated in more 
improvement when treatment with fremanezumab is initiated, compared to patients with EM which will be less 
sensitive to a change as they were not worse off at baseline.  
Different dose regimens (675-225-225 mg, 675 mg-placebo-placebo, 225-225-225 mg) have demonstrated 
highly similar efficacy results. However, the decision to recommend two alternative dosing options (675 mg 
quarterly or 225 mg monthly) for the same indication and treatment group was to be critically reflected with 
regard to accidental overdose. The Aplicant argued that the likelihood for accidental overdose would have been 
highest for patients on the 225-mg once monthly dosing regimen, with a starting dose of 675 mg for the first 
month. Based on the Applicant’s decision to remove the starting dose from the monthly dosing scheme in 
patients with chronic migraine, this risk of continued monthly administration of the 675 mg dose is substantially 
mitigated. Moreover, the information and guidance on the dosing and administration of fremanzumab provided 
with the SmPC and patient information leaflet is considered appropriate. Based on these considerations and 
given that the monthly administration of higher Fremanezumab doses (up to 900 mg) did not reveal an altered 
safety profile, CHMP agrees that there is currently no need to include “accidental overdose” to the list of 
important potential risks.  
A third dosing recommendation had initially been proposed by the Sponsor: a 675 mg loading dose for CM 
patients. Following CHMP request with respect to the results of the phase 2 and 3 studies the Applicant decided 
to change dosing recommendations in order to have the same dosing options (225 mg monthly and 675 mg 
quarterly) available for patients with EM and CM. The two dosing regimens that will now be available are 225 mg 
once monthly and 675 mg quarterly and have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety in the phase 3 study 
program. Based on these phase 3 data the 225 mg monthly regimen appears to be equally effective in the CM 
population compared to the 225 mg monthly regimen with a 675 mg starting dose. The Applicant provided 
thorough analyses on this issue, including analyses of efficacy in patients with high-frequency episodic migraine 
(as chronic migraine surrogate), PK/PD modelling and simulations. This approach was considered adequate. 
With the initial assessment CHMP raised concerns regarding the broad indication “prevention of episodic and 
chronic migraine in adults”. The Applicant acknowledged these concerns and decided to change the indication 
wording in order to limit the indication to patients with at least 4 migraine days per month. This restriction 
adequately reflects the population in the phase 3 program. Moreover, the more restricted indication statement 
takes into account that patients with less severe disease may be “overtreated” with prophylactic migraine 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 73/116 
  
  
 
treatment. The distinction of episodic and chronic migraine in the indication wording was not considered 
necessary, as these are spectrum of the same condition and not considered separate entities. 
Another concern was related to the treatment of older patients, since only few patients >65 years had been 
included in clinical studies. The Applicant therefore submitted additional analyses on the efficacy and safety of 
fremanzumab stratified by age. Based on these data no additional risks were identified for older patients. With 
regard to efficacy, the treatment effect was more pronounced in middle-aged patients. However, it was 
confirmed that patients of all age groups benefitted from fremanezumab treatment and that the (average) 
treatment effect of Fremanezumab in patients > 60 was in line with other age groups. Based on these data an 
indication wording without additional limitations in terms of age was agreed.  However, statements on the 
limited data in elderly patients (> 60 years) were included in the SmPC. 
With regard to evaluating when a person is a non-responder and should cease treatment, the Applicant initially 
stated that it would be worthwhile to allow each patient sufficient time for fremanezumab to reach its full efficacy 
potential, given the favourable safety profile. No deadline was suggested as to when this “sufficient time” is 
reached. This was not agreed by CHMP. The Applicant was requested to provide clear guidance in the SmPC  on 
when to evaluate whether a patient is a (non)responder in order to inform prescribers. Given that steady state 
of fremanezumab is reached by 3 months of dosing, a cut-off point of 3 months was considered long enough to 
evaluate if fremanezumab is working for the patient. Therefore, the following recommendation was included in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“The treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further decision to 
continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to continue treatment 
is recommended regularly thereafter.”  
Efficacy across subgroups  
Gender. Subgroup analysis on the effects of gender (male/female) was performed on mean headache days of 
at least moderate severity and migraine days for both pivotal studies. These analyses revealed a significant 
effect of all fremanezumab dosing regimens on both endpoints for women, but not for men.  
The Applicant stated in their responses that the observed differences in efficacy between men and women were 
likely caused by the small sample size in the male subgroup (< 50 men per study arm). In addition, the analyses 
performed in the main studies were not statistically powered to examine efficacy in patient subgroups. 
Region. The Applicant has not performed separate studies evaluating the efficacy/safety in the EU setting. 
European study centres were included in studies 30049 and 30050; however the majority of data was from 
North America. The Applicant was therefore requested to demonstrate that result from the global phase 3 
studies can be extrapolated to the EU setting.  
The Applicant explained that extrapolation to the EU setting is possible due to use of diagnostic criteria 
recognized worldwide, similarities of therapeutic guidelines, and the majority of the US patients were Caucasian 
which is representative of the EU general population. In addition it was also not expected that the prevalence of 
known CGRP polymorphisms to be ethnically disproportionate.  
The Applicant also stated that the subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint based on region showed 
substantial improvement after fremanezumab treatment across the geographical regions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 74/116 
  
  
 
 
Overall it can be seen that regardless of region, patients benefit from fremanezumab treatment compared to 
placebo. The observed differences in treatment response between the EU and US populations seem to be driven 
by the differences in treatment response in the placebo groups. Though the European population is small 
compared to the North American population, there is still a notion of effect modification.  
Taken together the Applicant has sufficiently justified that the study data can be extrapolated to the EU setting. 
Concomitant preventative medication use 
In the pivotal studies approximately 30% of the participants were allowed to use one concomitant preventative 
migraine treatment method, provided they were stable on a regime prior to study onset. In study 30049 it was 
shown that use of concomitant preventative treatment does not affect the effect size. The mean reduction in 
number of days was similar between the concomitant and the non-concomitant subgroups. In study 30050, the 
subgroup analysis on average number of migraine days showed that in both subgroups all fremanezumab 
treatments had a statistical significant effect. When comparing this subgroup with the subgroup that did not 
receive any concomitant treatment, there seems to be a slight numerical greater reduction in migraine days for 
concomitant users (-1.7 and -1.9 for the active treatment groups) than for the non-concomitant users (-1.1 and 
-1.3 for the active treatment groups). This is somewhat in contrast to the findings of the subgroup analysis in the 
CM study. The applicant was therefore requested to explain the possibility of a clinical benefit of combining 
fremanezumab treatment with other prophylactic medication.  
During the clinical development program it was shown that there was no additional benefit of add-on 
fremanezumab compared to fremanezumab monotherapy. The Applicant argued that patients who have more 
severe migraine and/or have a suboptimal response to their current prophylactic medication would benefit from 
add-on fremanezumab. It is also stated by the Applicant that fremanezumab could be an add-on therapy until 
the patient will have adequate migraine relief and wean off the existing prophylactic medication. Considering the 
safety profiles of existing migraine prophylaxis medication, it would be better for the patient to consider 
switching to fremanezumab altogether. Thus, this notion is supported. 
Initially there was no recommendation with regard to concomitant use of multiple migraine prophylaxis 
medication in the SmPC. The Applicant agreed to develop a rule on concomitant use of Ajovy with other migraine 
prophylaxis treatments and to which situations it applies. Additional text was included in the SmPC. 
Past use of preventative treatment  
The applicant performed a subgroup analysis on participants who have used topiramate or botox for migraine 
prophylaxis in the past. In both studies participants who previously used topiramate benefitted from 
fremanezumab treatment, as reflected by a significant reduction in the number of headache days of at least 
moderate severity or migraine days. However, this effect is not as apparent in the subgroup that previously used 
botox. In the CM study only the participants in the fremanezumab 675/225 mg group had a significant reduction 
whereas the 675 mg Q12W regimen did not. In the EM study, the analysis had no clear conclusion the efficacy 
of fremanezumab in participants who received treatment with Botox before. The applicant argued that this is 
due to the small sample size of participants who had previous exposure to botox.  
The Applicant has provided a pooled analysis on age, sex, region, and use of concomitant preventive treatment, 
exposure to previous treatment with topiramate or Botox across studies. Overall the plots support the previous 
findings that fremanezumab treatment has a beneficial effect across the subgroups.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of fremanezumab in prevention of migraine is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The fremanezumab clinical program comprises 13 studies with healthy subjects and patients with migraine: 8 
Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2b studies (double-blind, placebo-controlled), and 3 Phase 3 studies (2 double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies and 1 long-term, double-blind extension study). With the exception of the long-term, 
double-blind extension study and a Phase 1 bioequivalence study, all studies were completed at the time of data 
cut-off date (31 May 2017 for all safety data except for immunogenicity [immunogenicity data cut-off date: 02 
May 2017]). A total of 2768 patients and subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of fremanezumab in the 
migraine clinical development program. Considering all fremanezumab studies in the migraine clinical 
development program, 2229 patients received at least 3 months of fremanezumab treatment, 1343 patients 
received at least 6 months of fremanezumab treatment, and 260 patients received at least 12 months of 
fremanezumab treatment as time of the initial MAA (data cut-off 31 May 2017).  These data were completed 
with updated numbers and analyses provided with the Days 121 Responses (cut-off 30 May 2018).The 
integrated safety analysis for this MAA encompasses all completed and ongoing studies. Data from 2 Phase 2b 
studies and 3 Phase 3 studies in patients with EM and CM (Studies 021, 022, 30049, 30050, and 30051 [not 
competed] were integrated into 7 cohorts. With the exception of Study 30051, all integrated studies were 
completed by the data cut-off date. For Study 30051: 16 of these patients in the safety population had 
completed the study, 120 patients had discontinued from the study, and 1751 patients were ongoing in the 
study as of the data cut-off date. Data from patients in Study 30051 available in the clinical database as of 31 
May 2017 (or 02 May 2017 for immunogenicity data) are summarized in this SCS. Therefore, throughout this 
SCS, the summaries that include these data are footnoted as “preliminary.”

Patient exposure 
Patient disposition for all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1) 
A total of 2566 patients were randomized (862 in the placebo treatment group, 386 in the 225 mg monthly 
treatment group, 667 in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group, 467 in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting 
dose treatment group, 97 in the 675 mg monthly treatment group, and 87 in the 900 mg monthly treatment 
group), and all but 3 of these patients (>99%) received at least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluable for 
safety. Most patients (90% and 91% of patients who received fremanezumab and placebo, respectively) 
completed the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation in the fremanezumab and placebo 
treatment groups were withdrawn consent (3% and 2% of patients, respectively), lost to follow-up (2% and 3% 
of patients, respectively), and adverse events (2% in each group). The frequency of study discontinuations due 
to adverse events was similar across the proposed dosing regimens of 225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 
225 mg monthly with a 675 mg starting dose (1% to 2% of patients in each treatment group). 
Two patients in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group died: 1 patient (Study 30050) died 110 days after study 
drug exposure from an intentional overdose of diphenhydramine per the autopsy report after withdrawing 
consent due to a family emergency, and 1 patient (Study 30049) died 69 days after study drug exposure from 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) per the autopsy report. A third fatal case was reported with the 
Day 121 Responses.  
Patient disposition for all fremanezumab treated patients with migraine (cohort 4):  
A total of 2830 patients were randomized across Studies 021, 022, 30049, 30050, and 30051; 2515 patients 
were randomized to receive fremanezumab, and 862 patients were randomized to receive placebo. All but 3 of 
these patients (>99%) received at least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluable for safety. This cohort also 
included data from patients in Study 30051. A total of 1890 patients, 1578 patients from Study 30049 (N=916) 
and Study 30050 (N=661) and 312 new patients (ie, new patients and patients who completed the Phase 2b 
studies), were enrolled in Study 30051. All but 2 of these patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
were evaluable for safety. As of the last data cut-off date (30 May 2018), all but 2 patients completed the study, 
120 patients had discontinued from the study, and 1751 patients were ongoing in the study. The most frequent 
reasons for discontinuation from the study were withdrawn consent, adverse event, and lack of efficacy. The 
frequency of study discontinuations due to adverse events was similar across the proposed dosing regimens of 
225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 225 mg monthly with a starting dose of 675 mg (<1% to 1% of patients 
in each treatment group).

Adverse events 
Common Adverse Events (AE) for all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1) 
A common AE was defined as an event occurring in ≥2% of patients. A total of 1109 patients (65%; 981.10 
events/100 patient-years) who received fremanezumab experienced at least 1 adverse event compared with 
505 patients (59%; 833.61 events/100 patient-years) who received placebo. For the proposed dose regimens, 
236 patients (61%; 910.62 events/100 patient-years) in the 225 mg monthly treatment group, 458 patients 
(69%; 1112.31 events/100 patient-years) in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group, and 317 patients (68%; 
1026.24 events/100 patient-years) in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment group had at 
least 1 adverse event. 
Among patients treated with fremanezumab, adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
general disorders and administration site conditions (41%) and infections and infestations (20%). Adverse 
events in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site conditions (33%) and infections and infestations 
(19%) were also the most frequently reported among patients who received placebo. Adverse events occurred 
with similar frequency across active treatment groups with the exception of general disorders and 
Assessment report

administration site conditions, which occurred at a slightly higher frequency in the fremanezumab treatment 
groups that include patients in the Phase 3 studies (225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 225 mg monthly 
with a starting dose of 675 mg). 
The adverse event profile for all patients with CM in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 2) and all patients 
with EM in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 3) also showed the same trends as for all patients in the 
placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1). The adverse event profile of fremanezumab for all patients in the pivotal 
studies (cohort 7) was similar to that of all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1). 
Common Adverse Events for all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) 
A total of 1895 patients (75%; 998.34 events/100 patient-years) who received fremanezumab experienced at 
least 1 adverse event. The incidences of adverse events (event rates) for patients in the 225 mg monthly, 675 
mg quarterly, and 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment groups were 71% (986.48 events/100 
patient-years), 79% (998.53 events/100 patient-years), and 79% (1059.42 events/100 patient-years), 
respectively. 
As with all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1), the most frequently reported adverse events 
among all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) were in the SOCs of general disorders and administration 
site conditions (52%) and infections and infestations (34%). Adverse events occurred with similar frequency 
across the doses evaluated in Phase 3 (ie, 225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 225 mg monthly with a 
starting dose of 675 mg). 
The adverse event profile for all fremanezumab-treated patients with CM (cohort 5) and all 
fremanezumab-treated patients with EM (cohort 6) showed the same trends as for all fremanezumab-treated 
patients (cohort 4). 
Treatment-related Adverse Events in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1) 
A total of 758 patients (45%; 681.13 events/100 patient-years) who received fremanezumab experienced at 
least 1 adverse event considered related to the study drug by the investigator compared with 307 patients 
(36%; 528.17 events/100 patient-years) who received placebo. For the proposed dose regimens, 164 patients 
(42%; 642.79 events/100 patient-years) in the 225 mg monthly, 323 patients (48%; 803.52 events/100 
patient-years) in the 675 mg quarterly, and 219 (47%; 704.72 events/100 patient-years) in the 225 mg 
monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment groups had at least 1 adverse events considered related to the 
study drug. 
The most frequently occurring events in patients treated with fremanezumab were in the SOCs of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (39%), nervous system disorders (3%), and gastrointestinal 
disorders (2%), and the most frequently occurring events in patients treated with placebo were in these same 
SOCs (31%, 2%, and 2%, respectively). 
The most frequently occurring adverse events considered related to the study drug by the investigator were 
injection site reactions with a slight preponderance in patients who received fremanezumab.

Treatment-related Adverse Events in all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) 
A total of 1355 patients (54%) who received fremanezumab experienced at least 1 treatment-related adverse 
event. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events and the event rates were similar for patients in the 
225 mg monthly (53%; 737.54 events/100 patient-years), 675 mg quarterly (56%; 704.63 events/100 patient- 
years), and 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose (58%; 753.06 events/100 patient-years) treatment 
groups. 
Consistent with all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1), the most frequently reported 
treatment-related adverse events among all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) were in the SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions (49%), nervous system disorders (4%), investigations 
(3%), gastrointestinal disorders (2%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2%); all other SOCs 
reported treatment-related adverse events from ≤1% of the patients in cohort 4. Treatment-related adverse 
events occurred with similar frequency across the doses evaluated in Phase 3 (ie, 225 mg monthly, 675 mg 
quarterly, and 225 mg monthly with a starting dose of 675 mg). 
As with all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1), the most frequently occurring adverse events 
considered related to the study drug by the investigator in all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) were 
injection site pain (in 29% of patients [288.43 events/100 patient-years]), injection site induration (in 27% of 
patients [197.06 events/100 patient-years]), and injection site erythema (in 23% of patients [127.80 
events/100 patient-years]). Each of these treatment-related adverse events occurred with similar incidence and 
event rates across the 225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose 
treatment groups.

Adverse Events by Baseline Migraine Medication Use 
Table 18 Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 2% of Total Patients Treated with Fremanezumab by 
Preferred Term, Treatment Group, and Baseline Preventive Migraine Medication Use for All Patients 
in the Placebo- Controlled Studies—Cohort 1 (Safety Population) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Three deaths occurred in the fremanezumab migraine clinical development program. Additional details follow: 
•  A 59-year-old patient in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group (Study 30049) died 69 days after study 
drug exposure. The cause of death as indicated in the autopsy report was COPD, and the manner of 
death was reported to be natural. The event was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study 
drug. 
•  A 21-year-old woman with EM in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group (Study 30050) died 110 days 
after study drug exposure. According to autopsy, the patient died due to an intentional 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 84/116 
  
  
 
 
 
diphenhydramine overdose, and the manner of death was suicide.  The investigator assessed the death 
as unrelated to the study drug at the time of notification.  
•  A third fatal case was a patient with an arterial brain aneurysm and multiple strokes approximately 300 
days after the last dose of fremanezumab.  
Other serious adverse events 
Analysis of serious adverse events by MedDRA SOC and PT in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies 
revealed no clinically relevant trends. Serious adverse events were infrequent and occurred with similar 
incidences across the treatment groups. No event by PT occurred in ≥1% of patients, and the majority of serious 
adverse events (by PT) occurred in 1 patient each. Furthermore, no new safety signals were identified with 
long-term exposure to fremanezumab. 
Serious  Adverse  Events  in  all  patients  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  (Cohort  1)  Serious  adverse  events 
occurred in 21 patients (1%) who received fremanezumab and in 14 patients (2%) who received placebo in the 
placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1). No event by PT occurred in ≥1% of patients. By PT, serious adverse events 
that  occurred  in  more  than  1  patient  in  an  individual  treatment  group  were  drug  hypersensitivity  and 
nephrolithiasis in 2 patients each in the placebo treatment group. Other serious adverse events that occurred in 
more than 1 patient included pneumonia (in 1 patient each in 675 mg quarterly and 225 mg monthly with 675 
mg starting dose treatment groups), fall (in 1 patient each in the placebo and 225 mg monthly with 675 mg 
starting dose treatment groups), road traffic accident (in 1 patient each in the placebo and 675 mg quarterly

migraine (in 1 patient each in the placebo and 225 mg monthly treatment groups), and hypertensive crisis (in 
1 patient each in the 225 mg monthly and 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment groups). The 
most frequently occurring serious adverse events among all patients in the placebo-controlled studies occurred 
in 2 patients each, which included drug hypersensitivity, nephrolithiasis, pneumonia, fall, road traffic accident, 
wrist  fracture,  migraine,  and  hypertensive  crisis.  One  of  the  hypertensive  crisis  occurred  in  a  patient  with 
hypertension history. On the day of the event, the patient had a migraine attack and took ibuprofen, rizatriptan, 
and tramadol. The other event occurred in a 70-year-old woman in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting 
dose treatment group with a history of myocardial infarction and hypertension who experienced multiple similar 
events before entering the study and was diagnosed with labile hypertension on discharge from the emergency 
room.

Serious adverse events considered related to the study drug by the investigator occurred in 3 patients: 1 patient 
in the 225 mg monthly treatment group (PT: generalized tonic-clonic seizure) and 2 patients in the placebo 
treatment group (PTs: diploplia, drug hypersensitivity, dyspnea, and peripheral edema in 1 patient and lentigo 
maligna in another patient). The event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred in a 23-year-old patient who 
was taking nortriptyline for migraine headaches. The patient had a previous (at approximately age 5) and recent 
(occurred 2 weeks prior to the event) history of concussion and was diagnosed with bilateral ankle clonus 
approximately 6 months before receiving the 1st dose of study drug. With the exception of the event of 
generalized tonic-clonic seizure, each of the serious adverse events considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator led to discontinuation from the study drug. Other serious adverse events (all considered unrelated 
to the study drug by the investigator) that led to discontinuation from the study drug included migraine and 
hypertensive crisis in a 70-year-old woman in the 225 mg monthly treatment group with a history of myocardial

monthly treatment group, suicide attempt in a patient in the 900 mg monthly treatment group, and drug 
hypersensitivity in a patient in the placebo treatment group. 
All serious adverse events resolved or were resolving by the end of study participation with the exception of an 
event of intestinal hemorrhage (unknown outcome) in a patient with Munchausen syndrome, short bowel 
syndrome, and multiple intestinal surgeries who was lost to follow up, and events of antiphospholipid syndrome 
(not resolved/resolving), COPD leading to death, and death from an intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.

Adverse Events of special interest 
Ophthalmic adverse events, events of possible drug-induced liver toxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions and 
anaphylaxis were identified as adverse events of special interest based on the potential risks of fremanezumab 
identified in unconfirmed preliminary preclinical studies, small molecule CGRP antagonist development 
programs, and intrinsic factors for any biological molecule. These adverse events of special interest were defined 
as follows in the protocols for the Phase 3 studies: 
• 
• 
• 
ophthalmic adverse events of at least moderate intensity 
events of possible drug-induced liver injury (defined as any of the following: AST or ALT ≥3× the ULN, 
total bilirubin ≥2× the ULN, or INR >1.5) and Hy’s law events 
events of suspected anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions

Fourteen patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1; 2 of 861 patients who received placebo and 12 of 
1702 patients who received fremanezumab) had at least 1 ophthalmic adverse event of at least moderate 
intensity. There was no pattern in the types of ophthalmic adverse events that occurred; diplopia in 2 patients 
(1 in the placebo treatment group and 1 in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment group) and 
conjunctivitis in 2 patients (both in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group) were the only events to occur in more 
than a single patient. 
Other ophthalmic events of at least moderate intensity that occurred in patients in the placebo-controlled 
studies included eye injury in a patient in the placebo treatment group; vision blurred, retinal detachment, 
unilateral blindness (transient loss of vision on 2 occasions that resolved without treatment), eye hypoaesthesia 
and visual acuity reduced, and eye pain in 1 patient each in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose 
treatment group; optic disc drusen, vitreous detachment, and blepharitis in 1 patient each in the 675 mg 
monthly treatment group; and allergic conjunctivitis and eye infection in 1 patient each in the 900 mg monthly 
treatment group. 
Ophthalmic events of at least moderate intensity leading to discontinuation from the study drug in all patients in 
the placebo-controlled studies included a serious adverse event of diplopia considered related to the study drug 
in 1 patient in the placebo treatment group and a non-serious adverse event of retinal detachment considered 
unrelated to the study drug in 1 patient in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose treatment group. The 
latter event was associated with acute stress-induced hypertension. 
Events of possible drug-induced liver injury/ Hy’s law events 
No Hy’s law events were reported in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1). Adverse events of 
liver enzyme elevations meeting adverse event of special interest criteria (defined per the Phase 3 protocols as 
any of the following: AST or ALT ≥3× the ULN, total bilirubin ≥2× the ULN, or INR >1.5) occurred infrequently 
among patients in the placebo-controlled studies, and there was no meaningful difference in the frequency of 
events across the treatment groups.   
No adverse event of special interest related to liver enzyme elevations occurred ≥1% of patients who received 
fremanezumab. In addition, none of the adverse events of special interest related to liver enzyme elevations in 
all patients in the placebo-controlled studies were serious, and none led to discontinuation from the study. All 
the events resolved while on study drug, and none needed treatment. 
A total of 13 patients from Study 30049 (3 patients in the placebo treatment group and 5 patients in each 
fremanezumab treatment group) had adverse events of special interest related to elevated liver enzymes, 
hereof 3 patients in the placebo treatment group, 
Of the 10 patients from the active treatment group, 6 had elevation of ALT and/or AST at a single visit either 
during the study or at the end of the study. Five of these cases were 3 to 5× the ULN and 1 was 6× the ULN. No 
treatments were necessary for these events, and none led to discontinuation. 
Of the remaining 4 patients on active treatment, 
•  One patient had 3 consecutive ALT increases (3 to 4.5× the ULN). The event resolved by the end of the 
study while on study drug. The patient used oxycodone/ acetaminophen as needed for migraine and 
fluoxetine for depression. 
•  One patient had elevated ALT at screening (6× the ULN) and visit 4 (>10× the ULN). The visit 4 
elevation was concurrent with an upper respiratory tract infection, which was treated with

ethanol/paracetamol/dextromethorphan hydrobromide/ephedrine sulfate/doxylamine succinate. The 
elevated liver function test normalized after stopping the concomitant medication. This patient also had 
recent medical history of cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy (both in June 2015). 
•  One patient had elevated ALT and AST (3 to 5× the ULN) during 3 consecutive visits. This patient was 
confirmed during the study to have chronic cholelithiasis by ultrasound and moderate hepatitis B, 
moderate hepatitis C, and mild hepatitis A through serological tests. 
•  One patient had elevated total bilirubin at baseline (>1.5× the ULN) with 3 more consecutive elevations 
(1.1 to 2.3× the ULN). There were no concurrent ALT/AST increases. The elevated bilirubin value 
normalized by end of study. This patient used ibuprofen and acetaminophen/caffeine/ salicylamide as 
needed for migraine. 
A total of 4 patients (1 patient in the placebo treatment group and 3 patients in the fremanezumab treatment 
groups) in Study 30050 had adverse events of special interest related to liver enzyme elevations: 
•  One patient each who received placebo and fremanezumab had mild elevation of total bilirubin at 
baseline and at several times during the study. Both patients have Gilbert’s syndrome. 
•  One patient in the 225 mg monthly group had a single elevation of AST to 3× the ULN. The patient took 
acetaminophen/diphenhydramine approximately 5 days/week for insomnia and had wine at night 3 to 4 
days a week. 
•  One patient had several ALT increase of 3 to 5× the ULN from 10 January 2017 to 13 February 2017. 
This patient had recent cholecystectomy (2015) and used venlafaxine hydrochloride, losartan 
potassium, and metamizole sodium for different medical conditions. 
•  A total of 3 patients from the Phase 2b studies had adverse events of special interest related to liver 
enzyme elevations: 
•  One patient had hepatitis C. 
•  One patient had an unrelated adverse event of cholelthiasis and coincident elevated liver function test 
results at 3 consecutive visits, which peaked at >10× the ULN. 
•  One patient had ALT approximately 6.5× the ULN and AST approximately 4× the ULN at 1 visit, which 
normalized the visit after. This patient’s concomitant medications included valproate semisodium, 
ibuprofen, trazodone hydrochloride, pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, and macrogol. 
Liver enzyme elevations that met adverse event of special interest criteria and led to discontinuation from the 
study drug in all treated patients included the following events in Study 30051: 
•  AST increased (maximum AST value reported = 134 U/L) assessed as moderate in intensity and 
unrelated to the study drug by the investigator in 1 patient in the 225 mg monthly treatment group  
•  ALT increased (maximum ALT value reported = 121 U/L) assessed as moderate in intensity and related 
to the study drug by the investigator in 1 patient in the 225 mg monthly treatment group ( 
• 
hepatic enzyme increased (maximum ALT value reported = 274 U/L, maximum ALP value reported = 
168 U/L, and maximum AST value reported = 92 U/L) assessed as moderate in intensity and unrelated 
to the study drug by the investigator in 1 patient in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group

• 
transaminases increased (maximum ALT value=310 U/L, maximum AST value 172 U/L, and ALP and 
bilirubin within normal limits) in a patient in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group with a recent primary 
infection with Epstein-Barr virus also led to discontinuation from the study drug  
Each of these events resolved. 
Potential risks of calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibition 
Cardiovascular effects 
Because CGRP is a vasodilator, cardiovascular effects, including medication-induced hypertension, 
counterbalancing the effect of anti-hypertensive drugs that have vasodilatory properties, inhibition of stress- or 
ischemia-induced vasodilation, and impairment of cardioprotective mechanisms, are of potential concern with 
CGRP inhibition. 
Animal data have not raised any issues regarding potential cardiovascular effects of fremanezumab. 
Nonetheless, a broad evaluation of all adverse events related to cardiovascular function was undertaken to 
determine if a cardiovascular signal is apparent. No pattern was observed in cardiovascular events. The 
following PTs were evaluated: palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, aortic valve 
incompetence, arrhythmia, bundle branch block left, mitral valve incompetence, sinus arrhythmia, tricuspid 
valve incompetence, ventricular extrasystoles, blood pressure increased, heart rate increased, blood pressure 
diastolic increased, ECG PR prolongation, ECG QT prolonged, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, transient 
ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hot flush, hypertensive crisis, flushing, deep vein 
thrombosis, pallor, peripheral coldness, Raynaud’s phenomenon, hypotension, superficial vein prominence, 
peripheral venous disease, thrombophlebitis superficial, thrombosis, and venous thrombosis limb. 
Despite the prevalence of hypertension (9% and 10% of patients who received fremanezumab and placebo, 
respectively) in the patient population per medical histories, cardiovascular adverse events occurred 
infrequently with similar incidence in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1) who received 
fremanezumab and in patients who received placebo. Hypertension in 15 patients (11 patients [<1%] who 
received fremanezumab and 4 patients [<1%] who received placebo); tachycardia in 6 patients (3 patients 
[<1%] who received fremanezumab and 3 patients [<1%] who received placebo); and palpitations, blood 
pressure increased, and heart rate increased in 5 patients each (each in 3 patients [<1%] who received 
fremanezumab and 2 patients [<1%] who received placebo) occurred most frequently. The only other 
cardiovascular adverse event that occurred in more than a single patient was hypertensive crisis in 2 patients 
who received fremanezumab (<1%). 
Both patients had a medical history of hypertension, and both of these patients were taking antihypertensive 
medication at the time of onset of the event

Serious cardiovascular adverse events that occurred in all fremanezumab-treated patients during participation 
in Study 30051 included deep vein thrombosis in 2 patients, and transient ischemic attack, hypertension, and 
limb venous thrombosis in 1 patient each. Each of these serious adverse events was considered unrelated to the 
study drug by the investigator and resolved. Among these serious adverse events, transient ischemic attack and 
atrial fibrillation led to discontinuation from the study drug. The event of transient ischemic attack, which 
resolved without sequelae, occurred in a 58-year-old white female with a medical history of hypertension and 
cervical cancer. The investigator suspected atrial fibrillation as the cause of the transient ischemic attack. Other 
cardiovascular adverse events that occurred in patients in Study 30051 and led to discontinuation from the 
study drug included unrelated events of aortic valve incompetence, mitral valve incompetence, and tricuspid

valve incompetence in the same patient in the 225 mg monthly treatment group and angina pectoris (verbatim 
term: cardiac chest pain) considered related to the study drug in a patient in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg 
starting dose treatment group. The event of angina pectoris resolved within 3 hours without treatment. No 
similar events were reported before or after this event. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis 
Type I hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and type III hypersensitivity reactions are theoretically possible with 
any injected protein. Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions were analyzed as adverse events of 
special interest in the Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies and in the Phase 3 long-term safety study, and the 
individual CSR listings for the Phase 2b studies were also searched for events of anaphylaxis and severe 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
No events of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity to the study drug were observed in the studies in patients 
with migraine 
A review of events of drug hypersensitivity regardless of intensity in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies 
(cohort 1) demonstrates that drug hypersensitivity occurred in 2 patients (<1%) who received placebo and 2 
patients (<1%) who received fremanezumab. For patients in the placebo treatment group, drug hypersensitivity 
was assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug in 1 patient and attributed to a concomitant 
medication (ceftriaxone) in 1 patient. Both events in patients in the placebo treatment group were serious. For 
patients who received fremanezumab, drug hypersensitivity was assessed by the investigator as related to the 
study drug in 1 patient (900 mg monthly) and attributed to a concomitant medication (sulfa drugs) in 1 patient 
(225 mg monthly with a 675 mg starting dose). Neither event in patients who received fremanezumab was 
serious. All events resolved with steroid treatment (oral and/or topical) and/or antihistamine treatment, and all 
but 1 led to discontinuation from the study drug. The event of drug hypersensitivity that was attributed to 
ceftriaxone also required epinephrine. 
A review of events of drug hypersensitivity among all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4) demonstrates 
that 3 additional patients who received fremanezumab had drug hypersensitivity events (for a total of 5 patients 
[<1%; 0.39 events/100 patient-years]). Each of these events resolved with steroid treatment (oral and/or 
topical application) and/or antihistamine treatment, and all but 1 event led to discontinuation from the study 
drug. Drug hypersensitivity events that occurred in Study 30051 included 2 events, assessed as mild and 
moderate in intensity (1 of each intensity) and considered related to the study drug by the investigator. The 
third event was attributed to a concomitant medication (ciprofloxacin). 
In order to further characterize the safety of fremanzumab in patients with cardiovascular risk factors/ 
cardiovascular medication use the Applicant provides updated graphs and tabular overviews following analyses 
of long-term data from study 30051. Overall, these data do not reveal specific patterns of Fremanzumab’s safety 
profile in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.                                                                                                                            
Nonetheless, with regard to changes in blood pressure, there seems to be a trend for patients with poorly 
controlled hypertension (defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mm HG or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) to develop blood 
pressure (BP) increases with higher doses (675 mg, 675/225 mg) of fremanezumab.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory tests 
Clinical laboratory tests were performed at each visit in the placebo-controlled studies and at screening for 
“new” patients and at baseline and every other visit thereafter in the long-term safety study. Evaluation of 
changes from baseline in serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis parameters over time, shifts 
from baseline, and programmatically identified PCS values demonstrated no clinically meaningful trends in all 
patients in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1), and no safety signals based on laboratory test results were 
identified in all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4), the majority of whom were treated for 6 months or 
more with fremanezumab. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in mean changes from baseline for any serum chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis variables. Mean serum/ urine values for patients who received 
fremanezumab were generally similar to mean values for patients who received placebo. 
Results in all patients with CM in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 2) and all patients with EM in the 
placebo-controlled studies (cohort 3) were similar to those seen in all patients in the placebo-controlled studies 
(cohort 1). 
Vital signs 
Vital signs measurements were performed at every visit through the EOT visit for all studies included in the 
integrated safety cohorts. Evaluation of changes from baseline in vital signs parameters over time and 
programmatically identified PCS values demonstrated no clinically meaningful trends in all patients in the 
placebo-controlled studies (cohort 1), and no safety signals based on vital signs data were identified in all 
fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4), the majority of whom were treated for 6 months or more with 
fremanezumab. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in changes from baseline in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, respiratory rate, and weight, and there were no notable differences between the placebo and 
fremanezumab treatment groups in vital signs measurements over time. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed for patients receiving fremanezumab in the placebo-controlled studies (cohort 
1). In total, 1702 patients received fremanezumab in Studies 021, 022, 30049, and 30050, and 1701 patients 
had samples for immunogenicity assessment. ADA samples were collected at predose and at day 28, day 56 (in 
the Phase 2b studies only), and day 84 prior to fremanezumab administration/end of study (Study 021 CSR, 
Study 022 CSR, Study 30049 CSR, and Study 30050 CSR). Six of 1701 patients (0.4%) had 
treatment-emergent anti-fremanezumab antibody responses: 2 patients in Study 30049 and 4 patients in Study 
30050. Five of the 6 patients had ADA occurring at day 84, and the remaining patient was ADA-positive at day 
28 but became negative at day 84. 
ADA-positive patients were randomly distributed across the monthly and quarterly fremanezumab dosing 
schemes. The ADA titers were relatively low, varying from 0.306 to 1.13 in log10 scale. One of the 6 patients 
developed anti-fremanezumab NAb at day 84 in Study 30050. None of the 6 ADA-positive patients had 
significant safety consequences of ADA development. 
Immunogenicity is also being assessed in the long-term safety study (Study 30051). As of the data cut-off date 
for immunogenicity (02 May 2017), the immunogenicity response from 1140 patients (312 new patients and 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 95/116 
  
  
828 patients who rolled over from the pivotal studies [Studies 30049 and 30050]) had been monitored. In these 
interim results, ADA samples were collected at predose (new patients) and at day 84 (visit 5), day 168 (visit 8), 
and day 336 (visit 14) posttreatment. Treatment-emergent anti-fremanezumab antibody response was 
detected in a low proportion of fremanezumab-treated patients (18 patients [1.6%], 1 of whom had positive 
ADA in the pivotal study and remained positive in Study 30051), who were distributed across the monthly and 
quarterly treatment groups. Five of these patients were new patients, and 13 were rollover patients. The 
majority of the ADA positive samples occurred at day 84, ie, after 3 months of exposure (new patients or rollover 
placebo patients) or 6 months of exposure (rollover active patients) to fremanezumab. 
The ADA titers were relatively low, ranging from 0.239 to 1.14 in log10 scale. Out of 18 ADA-positive patients, 
11 had a neutralizing activity in their post-dose samples. Two of the ADA-positive patients showed decreased 
fremanezumab concentration at the time point coinciding with ADA occurrence. This observation may suggest 
that the drop in fremanezumab concentration could be due to the presence of ADA. There were no significant 
adverse events related to ADA development in patients with treatment-emergent ADAs, and no lack of efficacy 
was observed. 
With submission of the Day 121 Responses the Applicant provided an update on the immunogenicity results 
from study TV48125-CNS-30051. The results for treatment-emergent ADA (2%) were comparable to the 
previous results provided with the initial report (1.6%). The rate of neutralizing antibodies to fremanezumab 
was also unchanged (approx. 1%).  
47 of the 52 ADA-positive patients reported adverse events and none of these reported events were potentially 
related to type I or type III hypersensitivity. The other 5 ADA positive patients had no reported adverse events 
at the time of the data cut-off date. 
Therefore, the Applicant concludes that there is no evidence for a correlation between ADA development and 
hypersensitive reactions. No increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been observed in 
ADA-positive patients. 
Immunological events 
Six of 1701 patients (0.4%) had treatment-emergent anti-fremanezumab antibody responses: 2 patients in 
Study 30049 and 4 patients in Study 30050. Five of the 6 patients had ADA occurring at day 84, and the 
remaining patient was ADA-positive at day 28 but became negative at day 84. 
ADA-positive patients were randomly distributed across the monthly and quarterly fremanezumab dosing 
schemes. The ADA titers were relatively low, varying from 0.306 to 1.13 in log10 scale. One of the 6 patients 
developed anti-fremanezumab NAb at day 84 in Study 30050. None of the 6 ADA-positive patients had 
significant safety consequences of ADA development. 
Among all fremanezumab-treated patients (cohort 4), no events of anaphylaxis occurred, and only 3 patients 
had adverse events of drug hypersensitivity. Each of these events was not serious and resolved with steroid 
and/or antihistamine treatment. 
The incidence of ADA formation as of the data cut-off date was low, and there were no significant adverse event 
related to ADA or Nab development.. 
This finding was confirmed by the updated analyses submitted with the Day 121 Responses.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Fremanezumab is a fully humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2). As such it is expected to be degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins. Drug 
interactions are not expected, therefore, no drug-interaction studies have been conducted. There are no known 
interactions of fremanezumab with other medications, and there are no other forms of interactions currently 
known for fremanezumab. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The most common reasons for discontinuation in the fremanezumab and placebo treatment groups were 
withdrawn consent (3% and 2% of patients, respectively), lost to follow-up (2% and 3% of patients, 
respectively), and adverse events (2% in each group). The frequency of study discontinuations due to adverse 
events was similar across the proposed dosing regimens of 225 mg monthly, 675 mg quarterly, and 225 mg 
monthly with a 675 mg starting dose (1% to 2% of patients in each treatment group). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 2566 patients were randomized (862 in the placebo treatment group, 386 in the 225 mg monthly 
treatment group, 667 in the 675 mg quarterly treatment group, 467 in the 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting 
dose treatment group, 97 in the 675 mg monthly treatment group, and 87 in the 900 mg monthly treatment 
group), and all but 3 of these patients (>99%) received at least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluable for 
safety. Thus, the extent of exposure in the dose regimens intended for MAA (225 mg sc monthly, 225 mg sc 
quarterly with a 675 mg starting dose, and 675 mg sc quarterly) meets the exposure requirements of the 
International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) guidance. 
The median exposure for cohort 1 was 85.0 days (range 84.0; 87.00) for patients treated with fremanezumab 
and 85.0 days (range 84.0; 88.0) for patients treated with placebo. Duration of exposure corresponds to the 
12-week treatment duration that was employed in the phase 2 and phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. For 
cohort 4, as of the data cut-off date (May 2017), the median duration of exposure was 175.0 days (range 89.0; 
259.5) A total of 260 participants have had fremanezumab treatment for over a year. This is in line with the ICH 
E1 guideline on the extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term 
treatment of non-life-threatening conditions. 
The subjects integrated in the safety cohorts are considered representative for the migraine patient population 
with regards to demographics, disease characteristics, gender distribution, and concomitant medication. 
Patients with a history of or with currently suffering from clinically significant cardiac/cardiovascular disease as 
well as patients >70 years of age had been excluded from trial participation. Only few patients >65 years were 
enrolled.  The interpretation of results for older patients is hence limited due to the low number of patients > 65 
years of age. Results may indicate that the risk for psychiatric disorders, neurologic disorders, accidents and 
injuries, and vascular disorders was increased in the higher age groups. Such finding would not be completely 
unexpected for an overall older population.  
Adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 97/116 
  
  
 
 
For both cohorts approximately 65-75% of the subjects experienced at least one adverse event. Most of these 
were mild to moderate in nature. Most common reported adverse events under fremanezumab were injection 
site pain (24% and 30%, cohorts 1 and 4 respectively), injection site induration (17% and 27% cohorts 1 and 
4 respectively) and injection site erythema (16% and 24% cohorts 1 and 4 respectively). The incidences were 
similar in both cohorts. There was no difference between the treatment groups.  
The Applicant presented the incidence of adverse events over time. The most frequent occurring adverse events 
up to 24hr were injection site reactions. Adverse events seem to decline over months of exposure. The increase 
in months 3 to < 6 months is likely to be due to the start of the long term extension study. The emergence of 
adverse events over time was not further specified at time of initial MAA and it was therefore considered that the 
presented data only show that there is a general decrease. As it was considered unclear when exactly the 
adverse events emerged and how long they persisted over time, the Applicant was requested to provide data on 
when injection site reactions occurred and how long they persisted . The Applicant clarified that most injection 
site reactions after administration of fremanezumab were of short duration and mild severity. Most injection site 
reactions occurring with fremanezumab were seen with frequency similar to that of placebo-induced injection 
site reactions. All reactions resolved. Reactions that were seen with increased frequency in fremanezumab 
compared with placebo were erythema, pruritus, induration, and rash. 
There was no clear dose-response relationship seen in either duration or onset by the median times to the onset 
and the duration of the reactions in all patients in the double-blind studies (Cohort 1). The onset of reactions 
varies significantly. Injection site erythema and induration onset were seen within 1 minute in the 225-mg 
monthly, 675-mg quarterly, and 675/225/225-mg groups. Injection site pruritus had significant variations 
within these same groups, with the higher dose, 675 mg quarterly, having a later onset than the 225-mg dose. 
Injection site rash also had no clear dose-response relationship, with both the 675/225/225-mg and 675-mg 
quarterly dosing regimens having a later onset than the 225-mg dosing regimen. Variation is also seen in the 
durations of the reactions. Injection site pruritus and injection site rash both had a longer duration with the 
225-mg monthly dose than with the 675-mg quarterly dose. The Applicant concluded that this finding was likely 
due to the overall low numbers of patients with these reactions. (There were only 30 cases of injection site 
pruritus and 13 cases of injection site rash in all the fremanezumab groups together.) As a result, the 
minimum-maximum range in both duration and onset was very large. In conclusion, the injection site reactions 
in all treatment groups were of relatively short duration. All of the reactions resolved, and no significant 
differences were seen in the 225-mg monthly and 675-mg quarterly dosing regimens. The Applicant’s 
argumentation on this issue is considered plausible and the issue is therefore considered resolved. 
The percentage of injection site reactions is higher for the active treatment groups as compared to placebo. 
However in both cohorts, the 675mg Q12W treatment group has a higher incidence of injection site reactions 
when compared to the 225 mg Q4W group. Based on the lower time interval between active injections, it would 
be expected that the 225 Q4W group show a higher incidence of the injection site reactions. The applicant was 
therefore asked to clarify. The Applicant responded that the small differences in the incidence of injections site 
reactions between the active treatment groups are considered to be normal variability since there is no clear 
evidence of a greater incidence in patients who received the highest number of active injections. This 
argumentation is not completely agreed. Injection site erythema was found most frequently in the 675 mg 
quarterly group, although this dosing regimen was the one with the less frequent active injections. This might 
indicate that local tolerability of higher single doses of fremanezumab is reduced. However, the difference in the 
incidence of injection site reactions is relatively slow and data do not indicate a prolongation of symptoms with 
the administration of higher single doses. Moreover, overall safety and efficacy have demonstrated to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 98/116 
  
  
 
comparable. Therefore, the Applicants argumentation that having two alternative dosing regimens, monthly and 
quarterly dosing, may offer viable options for patients with migraine is considered acceptable.  
Abnormalities in laboratory values occurred at similar incidences among all treatment groups (all fremanzumab 
dosing regimens and placebo). No patterns could be found. 
Changes in vital sign occurred at similar incidences among all treatment groups (all fremanzumab dosing 
regimens and placebo). However, cases of hypertensive crisis occurred more often with fremanezumab. Based 
on fremanezumab’s mechanism of action, it can be assumed that patients with pre-existing hypertension may 
be at risk for aggravation of hypertensive disease with CGRP antagonists. The Applicant was therefore requested 
to present blood pressure data for all patients with a history of hypertension, patients with hypertensive blood 
pressure values at baseline, and patients using antihypertensive medications concomitantly and to discuss these 
data. It appears that the mean blood pressure remained unchanged over the course of months. The Applicant 
has provided a time to event analysis where an event was defined as consecutive visits with increase in diastolic 
blood pressure ≥10 mm Hg or increase in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mm Hg or started new hypertensive 
treatment. 
In cohort 1 it appears that more patients with diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg/ systolic blood pressure ≤ 
140 mmHg in the higher dose fremanezumab groups (675mg monthly and 900mg monthly) experience this  
event over time (~15% at month 3). For the dosing regimes as proposed in the current SmPC this is around 5% 
at month 3. This dose-response is much less visible in patients with diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg / 
systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg.  
In cohort 4 it is shown that more patients with diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg experience this event over 
time i.e. 25% at 15 months. No dose response effect is observed. For patients with blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, 
around 25% of patients also experienced an event at 15 months. It does appear that approximately 30% of 
patients in the 675mg quarterly dosing group experience this event at month 15, suggesting a dose dependent 
effect. For the systolic blood pressure, similar incidences are reported for both ≤ 140 mm Hg and > 140 mm Hg 
groups. No clear dose response relationship is observed. 
The Applicant also provided a relative risk analysis of blood pressure increased in patients without and patients 
with high blood pressure at baseline. From this, it appears that patients treated with higher doses of 
fremanezumab have a higher risk of experiencing blood pressure increases, in particular for the high dosing 
regimes. It is acknowledged that the patient groups for the 675mg monthly and 900mg monthly dosing regimes 
are small and that these regimes are also not proposed in the current SmPC by the Applicant. Nevertheless there 
dose dependent increase in relative risk. This effect is more apparent in patients who already had a high blood 
pressure at baseline. This may indicate a dose-dependent effect of fremanezumab on blood pressure in subjects 
with elevated blood pressure at baseline. However, patient numbers were rather small. 
The adverse event profile of fremanezumab in patients on preventive migraine medication at baseline (24% of 
fremanezumab-treated patients and 24% of placebo-treated patients in the placebo-controlled studies) is 
similar to that of the overall population and does not raise concerns. However, nervous system disorders 
including dizziness, headache and migraine seemed to occurr more often in fremanezumab treated patients 
using baseline migraine medications compared to those not using baseline migraine medications (in this respect 
the ISS differs slightly from the number presented in the table above). The Applicant was requested to discuss 
this finding, including results from study 30051 which had not been included in the current data set.  Based on 
the analyses submitted the incidence of neurologic AEs was not increased in patients treated concomitantly with 
standard migraine prophylactic therapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019

Adverse events leading to discontinuation were infrequent (overall < 4%). Discontinuation rates did not differ 
between the study arms and there was no pattern for the active treatment groups. The most common reason for 
study discontinuation was withdrawal of consent by the participant (5% in cohort 1, 4% in cohort 4). Time to 
withdrawal was not presented with the initial MAA and was therefore requested. The Applicant provided analyses 
on time-to-withdrawal for the long-term extension study. There appears to be no differences between treatment 
arms in drop outs for whatever reason. This may indicate that patients in the long term extension study benefit 
from fremanezumab treatment regardless of the treatment regime they have been randomized to.  
In order to improve the comparability of safety results, the Applicant was requested to provide a tabular 
overview of AEs/SAES which have been found to have occurred more often in older patients. This summary of 
AEs should be tabulated by age strata and treatment group (fremanezumab total vs. placebo) and should also 
include those data from study 30051 which had not been included in the initial dossier.  Based on the updated 
safety data submitted in response to the D120 LoQ no new safety risks were found, neither for the whole study 
population nor for the group of patients > 65 years of age.  Compared to other age strata, there was no increase 
in frequency of adverse events in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, or any other system organ 
class (SOC). These analyses are considered supportive for the Applicants intention that a restriction of the 
indication in terms of age is not required. 
Clinical withdrawal or rebound effects have not been observed in clinical studies conducted in subjects and 
patients receiving fremanezumab up to 2000 mg iv. Therefore, no concerns have been raised in this regard. 
Cardiovascular Safety 
56% of patients had at least 1 cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factor at baseline; 13% had a 
cardiovascular medical history including myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, and other, and 14% were receiving 
cardiovascular medications at baseline (patients on cardiovascular medications” used for migraine prevention 
were excluded). 65% percent of patients were using triptans that are known for potential cardiovascular effects, 
such as cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. Vascular disorders were found more frequently in 
patients treated with fremanezumab. Vascular events reported more frequently included cases of hypertensive 
crisis, peripheral coldness, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. It is recognized that the incidences of these events 
were rather small.  Drugs frequently used to treat migraine, such as triptans, and which are known to potentially 
adversely affect the cardiovascular system were included in the studies. No signal was identified in this patient 
population. Concomitant use of anti CGRP mAbs with medications that have potential cardiovascular effect, such 
as birth control pills, triptans, and ergots, did also not show to have negative cardiovascular effects in the 
assessed patient population. However, the population included in the phase 3 program was not entirely 
representative for the migraine population. It is known that migraine patients have an increased risk for vascular 
events, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors and > 70 
years of age had been excluded from trial participation. This may have led to a bias in safety signal detection. 
Consequently, even the only slightly increased number of vascular events observed should be handled as safety 
signal. The Sponsor was therefore requested to discuss this potential safety risk and to propose safety measures 
to mitigate this risk in clinical practice.  
Based on the data on cardiovascular safety presented in response to this question, the safety profile of 
Fremanezumab is comparable across age groups without specific safety signals for patients with cardiovascular 
risk factors (with exemption of the possible risk of blood pressure increase in patients with preexisting 
hypertension). Hence, the Applicant’s proposal for including a statement that safety data for patients with major 
cardiovascular diseases are lacking in section 4.4 of the SmPC (“Patients with certain major cardiovascular 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 100/116 
  
  
 
diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients.") 
is agreed. 
Based on the updated analyses, there seemed to be a trend for patients with poorly controlled hypertension to 
develop blood pressure increases with higher doses (675 mg, 675/225 mg) of Fremanezumab. This finding was 
based on rather small sample sizes, and the dosing regimen of 675/225 mg which seemed to have the strongest 
impact on BP increase is no more intended for MAA.  Moreover, of the 11 patients in the analysis, in actuality only 
one patient (13560012) in the 675mg study arm experienced 2 consecutive increases in BP. This patient had a 
history of hypertension which was not controlled, and was not on any study medication at the time of enrolment.  
The other ten cases described patients which initiated new anti-hypertensive treatment. In most of these cases 
there was also a prior diagnosis of hypertension and after initiation of a new antihypertensive treatment blood 
pressure returned to normal or improved. 
Thus, considering the above, it is agreed with the Applicant that a warning regarding monitoring of BP in patients 
with hypertension is not warranted. 
Two deaths occurred during the clinical program: one in study 30049 and one in study 30050. In the first case 
the cause of death was COPD as the report revealed evidence of COPD as well as hypertensive atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. There are theoretical concerns of potential cardiovascular risks associated with CGRP 
inhibition, thus a potential aggravating role of fremanezumab cannot completely be excluded. The second death 
concerned a suicide due to an intentional diphenhydramine overdose. Both deaths were considered to be 
unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. The Applicant was requested to further justify this labelling, in 
particular for the assumed COPD death.  In response to this question the Applicant provided a discussion of the 
relationship between fremanezumab use and the two deaths that occurred during the clinical development 
program.  
For the COPD death, the Applicant provided a discussion on the association between COPD/sudden death and 
left ventricular hypertrophy/sudden cardiac death. In the autopsy report, evidence of concentric left ventricular 
hypertrophy of the heart with perivascular fibrosis was found. The patient had a long medical history of 
hypertension, which was likely the cause of the fibrosis. In addition, the patient also recently had suffered from 
a respiratory infection, for which the patient was noncompliant to the prescribed medication. Taken together, it 
appears that the underlying medical conditions the patient had contributed to death, and not fremanezumab 
treatment. 
A third fatal case was reported with the Day 121 Responses. This case was a patient who experienced a brain 
aneurysm and multiple strokes approximately 300 days after the last dose of fremanezumab. He was 
hospitalized and died approximately a month later. The fatal event was assessed as not related to the study drug 
by the investigator and the sponsor. Detailed information on this case was provided. Based on these data, a 
relationship with fremanezumab use appears unlikely.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Eye disorders occurred most frequently in the fremanezumab 675/225/225 mg group. Ophthalmic AE by 
preferred term that occurred with higher frequencies in the fremanezumab 677/225/225 mg group included 
blurred vision, dry eye, visual acuity reduced, blindness unilateral, eye pruritus, hypoaesthesia eye, retinal 
detachment, and scleral detachment.  There was no increased incidence for eye disorders found in the 
fremanezumab 225 mg monthly and the fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly group compared with placebo. 
However, based on preclinical findings of periciliar inflammation in some animals and given the lack of long-term 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 101/116 
  
  
 
safety data at the time of MAA submission, the Applicant was requested to provide and thoroughly analyse 
updated data on ophthalmic events including final study data from study 30051.  
In response, the Applicant provided detailed analyses of all eye-related adverse events. The types of these 
events varied, and were analysed as being of different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Special attention was paid 
on the 6 cases of retinal events. There were two cases of retinal hole, one case and retinal tear and three cases 
of retinal detachment, which were classified as rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) which would point to 
a mechanistic origin. This assumption is supported by the case reports which reveal that all patients with RRD 
had specific risk factors for this disease. Overall, the Applicant concluded that a relationship of the reported 
ophthalmic AEs and Fremanezumab is unlikely and that analyses do not reveal a specific pattern with regard to 
time to onset or type of ophthalmic AE. This argumentation can be followed and the issue is considered resolved.   
Overall, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been low (<1%) and events have been of mild to 
moderate intensity. No cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity occurred. Two hypersensitivity events 
occurred during the long term extension study. The investigator assessed that these were related to the study 
drug. The Applicant was therefore requested to provide data on what time points these events occur and how 
long participants were exposed to fremanezumab treatment as well as further substantiate the relationship 
between fremanezumab treatment and the observed hypersensitivity events.  In the first case, the 
hypersensitivity reaction occurred a few hours after fremanezumab injection. In the second case the reaction 
occurred a two weeks after the first treatment session, which was reported as resolved at the next visit. After the 
second injection with fremanezumab the patient developed a reaction the following day. Both patients 
discontinued due to these adverse events.  
No conclusions with regard to a timeline of hypersensitivity reactions can be drawn based on these narratives as 
one occurred within a few hours whereas the other after a few days. Hypersensitivity to fremanezumab is 
currently addressed in the RMP and in the SmPC as a contraindication. The issue is therefore considered 
resolved. 
Elevation of hepatic enzymes was observed with a low incidence across fremanezumab treatment groups (< 
1%) and no association was found with lower or higher fremanezumab doses. For most cases of elevated liver 
enzyme test concurrent factors could be attributed (eg, co-medications with known hepatotoxicity, infections). 
In the long term extension a single case was identified with two events of increased ALT. These were assessed 
by the investigator as related to the study drug. It was unclear if there was any potential confounding of 
underlying diseases or concomitant medication use in these cases. The Applicant was therefore requested to 
clarify the relation between the elevated liver enzymes and fremanezumab. Eighteen cases were identified of 
patients with protocol-defined adverse event of possible drug-induced liver injury deemed by the Investigator as 
related to the study drug. Protocol-defined adverse events of special interest of possible drug induced liver 
injury include AST or ALT ≥3 × the ULN, total bilirubin ≥2 × the ULN, or international normalized ratio >1.5.  
A total of 18 cases of increased liver function measures as predefined were identified. Of these 18 patients, 4 
discontinued from the study due to the liver adverse event. Most of the adverse events seemed to have resolved 
within a month. All cases were assessed to be unrelated to fremanezumab. Two cases were considered 
unresolved due to completion of the study or withdrawal from the study. Overall, elevated liver enzymes were 
sporadic reported and no clear pattern could be distinguished. Most cases were confounded by concomitant 
medication use by the patient.  As fremanezumab is a monoclonal antibody and is not metabolized by the liver, 
the risk of liver toxicity is considered low. Considering all this, a relationship between fremanezumab injection 
and the observed liver injury is considered unlikely.  
Suicidality was measured by the ec-CSSRS. No obvious pattern that is related to a dosing regime could be 
identified. However, there seemed to be more adverse events of suicidal ideation/behaviour occurring in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 102/116 
  
  
active treatment groups, which has not been picked up by the eC-SSRS scores. There have also been 5 cases 
where a treatment-emergent positive score occurred on a single visit. It is unclear if there were confounding 
factors that lead to these positive scores and suicidality adverse events. The Applicant was therefore requested 
discuss how the positive scores are considered to be treatment related and provide and discuss narratives of the 
suicidality adverse events . Based on the information provided with the Day 121 Responses it was confirmed that 
the overall incidence of positive eC-SSRS scores post baseline and adverse events related to suicidal 
ideation/behaviour are low across the treatment groups. Most cases appear to be confounded by pre-existing 
psychiatric illness, such as depression or anxiety, for which they received concomitant treatment. It is agreed 
that the cases reported appear to be unrelated to fremanezumab treatment.  
The effects of fremanezumab on human foetal development are not known. The Applicant was therefore 
requested to discuss the pregnancy cases in more detail. The number of pregnancies reported on fremanezumab 
was 15. The complication rate under fremanezumab was 33%, compared to 60% in the placebo arm. Based on 
the updated data, no association of use of fremanezumab with an increase in pregnancy complications or with 
a specific pattern of pregnancy complications can be drawn. The Applicant agreed to further study the safety of 
fremanezumab in pregnancy with a Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) as an additional pharmacovigilance 
activity to collect additional data on the use of fremanezumab in pregnancy in the post-approval period. Based 
on the data on use of fremanezumab available today this approach is considered adequate.  
Immunogenicity 
Treatment-emergent anti fremanezumab antibody (ADAs) responses were low across the clinical studies and in 
the long-term extension study. In the randomized-control studies, 1 participant developed anti-fremanezumab 
neutralizing antibodies (NABs). Based on the updated immunogenicity results from study TV48125-CNS-30051 
provided, the results for treatment-emergent ADA (2%) were comparable to those provided with the initial 
report (1.6%). The rate of neutralizing antibodies to fremanezumab was also unchanged (approx. 1%).  In 
conclusion, it was confirmed that the development of ADA in response to the treatment with fremanezumab was 
rather low and that the occurrence of ADA was not associated with specific safety issues, i.e. hypersensitivity, or 
with a reduced efficacy.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Fremanezumab at all doses tested was generally well tolerated in migraine patients. The long term safety, in 
particular with regards to cardiovascular outcomes and pregnancy will be closely monitored post-approval as 
these patients were not studied in the clinical trials.

Conclusion 
The  CHMP  and  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  1.4  (dated  29  January  2019)  is 
acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14 September 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that fremanezumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers fremanezumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, AJOVY (fremanezumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and is a biological product.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine is a neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of headaches, accompanied by 
associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia.  The headache is often 
unilateral, of moderate to severe intensity, throbbing and aggravated by physical activity. An attack can be 
preceded by sensory warning symptoms or signs (aura), and may last for 4-72 hours. The attacks are often 
disabling and associated with missed activities at work, school or at home.  
Migraine prophylaxis is recommended if the subject has more than 2 - 4 attacks per month. The main goal of 
prophylactic treatment in migraine is to reduce the number of migraine attacks or number of migraine days.  
Migraine is considered a spectrum disorder, including episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). EM is 
defined as having fewer than 15 headache days per month. CM is defined by more than 15 headache days per 
month, with at least 8 days being migraine days thus having intercurrent headache days. The differential 
diagnosis between CM and medication overuse headache and tension headache can be difficult. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The majority of patients with low-frequency episodic migraine treat individual attacks by taking medication for 
acute treatment on an as needed basis.  These medications include triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, simple and combination analgesics, opioids, and ergots.   
Patients with more frequent migraine attacks may need migraine prophylactic treatments. Several migraine 
prophylactic treatments are available in the European Union. Beta-blockers (metoprolol and propranolol), 
calcium channel blockers (flunarizine) or anticonvulsants (topiramate and valproic acid) are recommended in 
prophylactic treatment of migraine in order of preference. Botulinumtoxin A is currently the only treatment 
approved in some member states for migraine prophylaxis in CM.  
Patients often switch between prophylactic medications. This is likely due to the combination of factors 
complicated titration schedules, requirement of daily dosing, side effects, delayed onset of efficacy affecting 
long-term compliance and/or insufficient long term efficacy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The primary evaluation of efficacy was based on the data from 2 nearly identical Phase 3, 16-week, multicentre, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group studies (Study 30049 in patients with CM and 
Study 30050 in patients with EM), which tested the proposed dose regimen of 225 mg monthly or 675 mg 
every 3 months (quarterly). Patients with CM received a starting dose of 675 mg the first month, when initiating 
the monthly dose regimen. The studies included female and male patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with a history 
of migraine for at least 12 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019 
Page 108/116 
  
  
 
 
The studies consisted of a screening visit, a 28-day run-in period, and a 12-week (84-day) treatment period, 
including a final evaluation at week 12 (end-of-treatment [EOT] visit, approximately 4 weeks [28 days] after the 
final dose of study drug). 
Long-term efficacy data will be evaluated in Study 30051, which is an ongoing Phase 3 multicentre, randomized, 
double-blind, parallel-group study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sc administration 
of fremanezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine. Study duration for patients who completed the 
pivotal efficacy studies of fremanezumab (Studies 30049 and 30050) consists of a 12-month treatment period 
and a 6.5-month follow-up period. Patients who received either of the 2 active fremanezumab dose regimens 
during the pivotal studies remained in their same treatment arm during the long-term study without switching 
between dose regimens at any time during the studies. Placebo-treated patients were randomized to receive 
active fremanezumab treatment (either monthly or quarterly). For patients who had not participated in a pivotal 
efficacy study, the study consists of a screening visit and 28-day run-in period, a 12-month treatment period, 
and a 6.5-month follow-up period (Figure 1 and Figure 2). There were approximately 300 new patients (not 
participants on pivotal trials 30049/30050) allowed to enter the study. Patients receive 1 of the following dose 
regimens in a treatment-blinded fashion: 
• 
• 
• 
s.c. fremanezumab at 675 mg followed by 11 monthly s.c. doses of fremanezumab at 225 mg 
monthly s.c. fremanezumab at 225 mg for 12 months 
quarterly s.c. fremanezumab at 675 mg for 12 months for a total of 4 doses 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The Applicant demonstrated superiority of fremanezumab versus placebo in the reduction in the monthly 
average number of headache days of at least moderate severity (primary endpoint in study 30049), and in the 
monthly average number of migraine days (primary endpoint in study 30050). Key secondary endpoints have 
also been met, indicating the potential of fremanezumab to decrease the  number, duration and burden of 
migraine symptoms. 
The different dose regimens tested (675-225-225 mg, 675 mg quarterly, and 225-225-225 mg) have 
demonstrated similar efficacy results. 
In the chronic migraine study (30049), subjects had a LS mean change from baseline (13.1) in monthly average 
number of headache days of at least moderate severity of -4.2 in the 675 mg Q12W group, -4.5 in the 675/225 
mg group and -2.5 in the placebo group. Differences versus placebo were significant (p<0.001) 
Change in monthly migraine days form baseline (16.2) were -4.9, -5.0 and –3.2 days for the 675mg Q12W 
group, 675/225 mg and placebo respectively. Difference versus placebo were significant (p<0.001) 
The proportion of responders defined as a subjects with a 50% reduction in headache days was 37.6% of 
subjects in the 675 mg/placebo/placebo group, 40.8% of subjects in the 675/225/225mg group and 18.1% 
subjects in the placebo group. Differences versus placebo were significant (p<0.001). 
Change in monthly days of acute headache medication use from baseline was –3.7, -4.2 and -1.9 days for the 
675mg Q12W group, the 675/225 mg group and placebo respectively. Difference versus placebo was significant 
(p<0.001 for both groups).  
The headache impact score, as measured by the HIT-6 questionnaire, also improved under fremanezumab 
treatment when compared to placebo. The change from baseline (64.3) in migraine-related disability score was 
-6.4, -6.8 and -4.5 for fremanezumab 675mg Q12W, fremanezumab 675/225mg and placebo respectively. For

the PGIC a similar effect was observed, participants in both active treatment groups were more likely to be 
responders (>= moderate improvement) than patients who received placebo (37% in placebo, 55% in 
fremanezumab Q12W, 54% in fremanezumab 675/225mg). 
Efficacy over the subgroups (i.e. age, sex, concomitant prophylactic medication use, past use of botox, past use 
of topiramate) were consistent with the findings on the primary analysis with the exception of sex. Here, there 
was a lack of efficacy in the males. In the concomitant prophylactic treatment subgroup analysis, it was shown 
that subjects who did not use concomitant migraine prophylaxis medication also had a significant reduction in 
the number of headache days of at least moderate severity (nominal p < 0.001). Overall subjects had a mean 
difference of -4.6 days for the 675mg Q12W group, -4.8 for the 675/225 group and -2.6 for the placebo group. 
Subjects with concomitant prophylactic medication had a mean reduction in the number of headache days of 
-3.8 days for the 675mg Q12W group and -4.4 days for the 675/225 mg group (p= 0.0549 and 0.0031 
respectively).  
In the episodic migraine study (30050), subjects had a mean change from baseline (9.1) in migraine days of 
3.4- in the 675 mg/placebo/placebo group, -3.7 in the 225/225/225 mg group and -2.2 in the placebo group. 
Differences versus placebo were significant (p<0.001) 
Change in monthly days of acute headache medication use from baseline (7.8) was –3.4, -3.7 and –2.2 days for 
the 675mg Q12W group, the 225 mg Q4W group and placebo respectively. Difference versus placebo was 
significant (p<0.001 for both groups).  
The proportion of responders defined as a subject with a 50% reduction in migraine days was 44.4% of subjects 
in the 675 mg Q12W group, 47.7% of subjects in the 225 mg Q4W group and 27.9% in the placebo group. 
Differences versus placebo were significant (p<0.0001 for both groups).  
The Migraine Disability Assessment Score supported the primary endpoint. Improvement form baseline MIDAS 
score (39.0) was -23.0 for the  675mg Q12W group, -24.6 for the 225mg Q4W group and -17.5 points for the 
placebo group. Difference form placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0023 and p=0.0021). For the PGIC a 
similar effect was observed, participants in both active treatment groups were more likely to be responders than 
patients who received placebo (51% in placebo, 64% in fremanezumab Q12W, 72% in fremanezumab 225mg 
Q4W) 
Efficacy over in subgroups (i.e. age, sex, concomitant prophylactic medication use, past use of topiramate or 
past use of botox) were consistent with the findings on the primary analysis with the exception of sex. Here, 
there was a lack of efficacy in males. For the concomitant prophylactic treatment subgroup analysis, it was 
shown that subjects who did not use concomitant migraine prophylaxis medication also had a significant 
reduction in the number of migraine days (nominal p < 0.001). Overall subjects had a mean difference of -3.5 
days for the 675mg Q12W group, -3.7 days for the 225mg Q4W group and –2.4 days for the placebo group. 
Subjects who did use concomitant prophylactic medication also showed statistical significant reduction in the 
number of migraine days: -3.7 days for the 675mg Q12W group, -4.0 days for the 225mg Q4W group and -2.0 
days for the placebo group  (nominal p=0.044 and p=0.0088 respectively). Participants who used topiramate in 
the past for migraine prophylaxis also benefitted from prophylactic treatment.  
Persistence of effect is likely based on the preliminary results of the ongoing long term extension study i.e. 
30051.  Overall, the results are consistent showing a positive effect of fremanezumab treatment with regard to 
the main and exploratory endpoints in both episodic and chronic migraine. The effect is present after the first 
week after the first dose. All three treatment regimens (675mg Q12W. 675/225 mg and 225mg Q4W) seem to 
have equal efficacy, thus allowing the migraine patient the choice to adopt the most convenient treatment 
regimen for them.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is still uncertain how long should treatment continue considering that migraine severity fluctuates over time. 
As requested, the Applicant agreed to add guidance on the evaluation of non-responder in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC ( “The treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further 
decision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to continue 
treatment is recommended regularly thereafter.”) 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Fremanezumab at all doses tested was generally well tolerated in migraine patients. Injection site reactions 
were the most common AEs and an increased incidence of local injection site reactions was found with higher 
fremanezumab doses, including injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site erythema, and 
injection site pruritus. With regard to the different fremanzumab dose groups, injection site reaction of each 
type occurred more frequently with the higher single dose of 675 mg quarterly.  
There is a concern that treatment with GCRP antagonists may lead to an increased risk for vascular events, 
including but not limited to ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Indeed, vascular disorders were found 
more frequently in patients treated with fremanezumab (including cases of hypertensive crisis, peripheral 
coldness, and Raynaud’s phenomenon). It is recognized that the overall incidence of these events were rather 
small.  However, since it is known that migraine patients have an increased risk for vascular events and as the 
population included in the phase 3 program was not entirely representative for the migraine population (patients 
with cardiovascular risk factors and > 70 years of age had been excluded from trial participation which may have 
led to a bias in safety signal detection), even the only slightly increased number of vascular events observed 
should be handled as safety signal.  
Changes in vital sign occurred at similar incidences among all treatment groups (all fremanzumab dosing 
regimens and placebo). However, cases of hypertensive crisis occurred more often with fremanezumab. Based 
on fremanezumab’s mechanism of action and based on the data submitted, it can be assumed that patients with 
pre-existing hypertension may be at risk for aggravation of hypertensive disease with CGRP antagonists. 
Overall, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been low (<1%) and events have been of mild to 
moderate intensity. No cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity occurred. However, hypersensitivity and 
injection site reactions are common risks of all monoclonal antibodies. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients >70 years of age and patients with major cardiovascular disease have not been included in the efficacy 
trials. Whether the safety of fremanezumab as demonstrated in studies 30049 and 30050 can be extrapolated 
to an older population and to cardio-vascularl more severely compromised subjects remains subject for further 
monitoring.  
The theoretical risk that CGRP blockade may aggravate ischemic events by lack of compensatory vasodilation 
still remains. In particular for patients with migraine, as they already have an increased risk for these events. 
However there is uncertainty whether chronic fremanezumab administration is safe in cardiovascular severly 
compromised subjects. The current exposure of fremanezumab in elderly patients is still very limited. In the 
clinical trial program only 2% of patients were >65 years. This population may be at higher risk of potential 
adverse vascular effects, but sufficient clinical data are currently not available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/118499/2019

The effects of fremanezumab on human foetal development are not known. There is some evidence that CGRP 
could be involved in feto-placental resistance and in blood pressure regulation during pregnancy. Low CGRP 
levels have found to be associated with pre-eclampsia. The data on pregnancies available today do not indicate 
a specific risk profile. However, the number of pregnancies reported is rather small which may limit the 
prognostic value of these data. ”Use in pregnant women (including those at risk for pre-eclampsia)”will 
therefore be included as an area of “Missing Information” in the RMP. Teva in addition proposes to study the 
safety of Fremanezumab in pregnancy post-marketing with a Post-Authorization Safety Study as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity (see also response to Question 164). This approach is endorsed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoints of the studies have been met and superiority of fremanezumab over placebo in reducing 
the number of headache days of at least moderate severity, and in reducing the number of migraine days in both 
CM and EM patients has been demonstrated. Key secondary endpoints have also been met, indicating the 
potential of fremanezumab of decreasing the number, duration and burden of migraine symptoms. 
However, albeit demonstration of the statistical significance of the treatment effect, the absolute difference 
compared to placebo-control was relatively small due to a significant placebo effect. Especially in the treatment 
of EM the difference in treatment effect was small. This may limit the usefulness of fremanezumab in this group 
of patients and should be considered with regard to the benefit-risk-evaluation. Reduction of acute medications 
could be considered a clinical relevant additional benefit, but even for this endpoint the absolute difference to 
placebo was rather small. However, clinical benefit was consistently demonstrated for all patient subgroups over 
a treatment period of up to 15 months. The different dose regimens tested (675-225-225 mg, 675 mg quarterly, 
and 225-225-225 mg) have demonstrated highly similar efficacy results.  
The overall LS mean reduction from baseline in the number of average monthly headache days of at least 
moderate severity during the double-blind treatment phase was -4.6 days for fremanezumab 675-225-225 mg 
and -4.3 days for fremanezumab 675 mg-placebo-placebo compared with -2.5 days for placebo (study 30049).  
The LS man change difference from placebo was -2.1 and -1.8; p<.0001 for each dose group versus placebo.

The overall LS mean reduction from baseline in the number of average monthly migraine days during the 
double-blind treatment phase was -3.7 days for fremanezumab 225-225-225 mg and -3.4 days for 
fremanezumab 675 mg-placebo-placebo compared with -2.2 days for placebo (study 30050).  The LS mean 
change difference from placebo was -1.5 and -1.3; p<.0001 for each dose group versus placebo. 
Based on current study data the safety profile of fremanezumab is considered acceptable. Fremanezumab at all 
doses tested was generally well tolerated in migraine patients. An slightly increased incidence of local injection 
site reactions was found with higher fremanezumab doses. Only few discontinuation due to AEs have been 
registered in clinical trials and most events have been judged as been manageable and being of mild to 
moderate intensity. 
However, some AEs appeared to occur with higher frequency in fremanzumab-treated patients. Such 
imbalances have been found for vascular disorders (including cases of hypertensive crisis, peripheral coldness, 
and Raynaud’s phenomenon). It is recognized that the overall incidence of these events were rather small.  
However, since it is known that migraine patients have an increased risk for vascular events and as the 
population included in the phase 3 program excluded patients with severe cardiovascular disease and patients 
> 70 years of age, this may have led to a bias in safety signal detection. Therefore even the only slightly 
increased number of vascular events observed should be handled as safety signal. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects of fremanezumab have been consistently demonstrated in two phase 2 and two phase 3 
studies in patients with chronic or episodic migraine. These results were found to be clinically relevant and 
considered to outweigh the observed risks.  
The indication has been restricted to patients who have at least 4 migraine days per month as this reflects the 
population in the phase 3 program. Moreover, the more restricted indication statement takes into account that 
patients with less severe disease may be “overtreated” with prophylactic migraine treatment.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of Ajovy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of AJOVY is favourable in the following indication: 
AJOVY is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription.

Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
N/A 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
N/A 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that fremanezumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

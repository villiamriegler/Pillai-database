1. 
Introduction 
The  active  substance,  pregabalin  is  an  analogue  of  the  mammalian  neurotransmitter  gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, pregabalin does not mediate its effects specifically though an 
effect  upon  GABA-ergic  transmission.  It  is  claimed  that  the  mechanism  of  action  of  pregabalin  is 
binding to an auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous 
system, potently displacing [3H]-gabapentin. 
On  6  July  2004,  a  Commission  Decision  was  granted  for  Lyrica  (pregabalin)  for  the  treatment  of 
peripheral neuropathic pain and for partial seizures (as adjunctive therapy) in adults. The Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) (Pfizer Ltd.) submitted on 15 July 2005 an application for the following 
extension of indication: “treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults.” The rationale 
for  the  proposed  addition  of  the  GAD  indication  is  based  on  both  preclinical  and  clinical  evidence 
obtained with pregabalin.  
2. 
Non clinical aspects 
2.1 - Primary pharmacology 
Pregabalin  has  anxiolytic-like  activity  in  animals.  In  particular,  pregabalin  is  effective  in  anxiety 
models  like  punished  responding  conflict  tests  in rodent  and  monkey  (Geller  and  Vogel  Water-Lick 
Conflict  tests;  ED50-value  of  3-10  mg/kg  p.o.)  that  are  sensitive  also  to  benzodiazepine  and  other 
clinically useful anxiolytic drugs. 
In  the  Geller  Conflict  test  in  rats  the  maximum  effect  was  observed  with  a  30  mg/kg  dose.  Higher 
doses decreased the response due to sedation/ataxia. In the rhesus monkey this dose was the minimal 
effective dose.  
It should be noted that in previously reported CNS safety pharmacology studies submitted as part of 
the  original  application  for  Marketing  Authorisation,  rats  given  oral  doses  of    >25  mg/kg  showed 
reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, keep balance in walking on a narrow rod and ataxia. In the 
Sidman avoidance test in squirrel monkeys, pregabalin dose-dependently reduced activity and motor 
coordination  at  30  and  100  mg/kg  indicating  sedative-like  activity  and  reduction  of  motor 
coordination.  
These data suggest that similar side-effects in humans may occur at therapeutic doses, which should be 
weighed in the risk-benefit assessment for this indication. 
2.2 - Safety pharmacology 
One additional piece of pharmacological data is in vitro hERG potassium channel pharmacology. 
tested  at  60  and  600  µM  concentrations  with  single  cell  voltage-clamp 
Pregabalin  was 
electrophysiology in a stable mammalian fibroblast cell line expressing recombinant hERG channels. 
Pregabalin  did  not  alter  the  function  of  hERG  channel  in  a  manner  that  was  different  from  5  min 
incubation  without  drug  addition  (Pfizer  Study  Report  PD144723/IC/001/05).  These  results  suggest 
that pregabalin is unlikely to alter cardiac function via interaction with hERG channels in the heart. 
The  maximum  concentration  chosen  in  this  study  exceeded  the  human  therapeutic  free  plasma 
concentration by a factor of 10. Therefore the margin of safety that can be derived from this study is 
limited. Yet, in view of the minimal effect observed at 600 µM (∼11% inhibition), it may be concluded 
that the results do not raise a concern with respect cardiac safety.

Clinical aspects 
GCP statement on application of ethical standards in clinical trials  
The  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted 
outside  the  community  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  standards  of  Directive 
2001/20/EC (Articles 8 (ia) of the amended Directive, 9.4(c) and 127 (a) of the new Regulation).  
The  MAH  provided  a  statement  that  Lyrica  (pregabalin)  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  of  the 
Community  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ethical  standards  of  ICH  GCP  and  therefore  in 
accordance  with  the  ethical  standards  of  Directive  2001/20/EC.  The  CHMP  considers  the  MAH’s 
response acceptable. 
3.1   Clinical efficacy 
3.1.a  Introduction 
Treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 
GAD  was  introduced  into  the  psychiatric  nomenclature  in  1980  with  the  publication  of  DSM-III 
(Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders).  The  diagnostic  changes  applied  to  GAD 
between  DSM-III  and  DSM-IV  have  made  it  difficult  to  develop  a  consistent  understanding  of  its 
course.  The  Epidemiologic  Catchment  Area  (ECA)  study  found  that  the  duration  of  DSM-III  GAD 
was  longer  than  five  years  in  40%  of  patients.  The  reported  lifetime  prevalence  rates  for  DSM  IV 
GAD in the general population is approximately 5-6% with rates as high as 10% among women aged 
40 years and above and in elderly (aged 55-85 years) of about 7%. 
Cross-sectional  rates  among  primary  care  attendees  are  about  8%,  making  GAD  the  most  prevalent 
anxiety disorder in primary care. 
GAD seems to be a disorder not occurring in children, as a condition on its own. Prevalence rates of 
GAD in adolescents seem to be low. 
As GAD is a more chronic disorder, treatment needs to be prolonged beyond short-term usage. 
Diagnosis 
The defining features of GAD are excessive anxiety and worry, and the diagnosis can only be made 
when there is significant social, occupational, and functional impairment that has persisted for at least 
6 months (according to DSM IV functional impairment is not necessary for the diagnosis if clinically 
significant distress is evident) 
Clinical manifestation 
Patients with GAD may have many somatic complaints. This may account for the high use of medical 
resources  among  patients  with  GAD.  In  addition,  patients  with  GAD  have  higher  risk  of  negative 
outcome (e.g. increased burden on the health care system, increased morbidity and mortality rates). 
GAD  is  associated  with  diminished  overall  emotional  health  and  identified  evidence  of  decreased 
employment and corresponding increased reliance on public assistance, impaired social life, and low 
ratings of life satisfaction.  
In  conclusion  GAD  is  associated  with  significant  psychosocial  impairment  and  significant  negative 
effect on quality of life.  
Co-morbidity 
GAD  is  frequently  associated  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  other  mental  disorders,  with  a  lifetime 
comorbidity among 90.4% of the people who had a history of GAD (about 17% of the GAD patients 
report  a  lifetime  major  depression;  also  other  anxiety  disorders  are  very  common  in  patients  with 
GAD).

Scales 
In  the  GAD  studies  the  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  is  the  primary  outcome  measure. 
This  scale  is  not  ideal  to  measure  GAD  but  is  “routinely  used  in  GAD  studies  for  registration 
purposes”. The HAM-A provides an overall measure of global anxiety, including psychic and somatic 
symptoms.  The  HAM-A  is  a  clinician-rated  scale  that  measures  the  severity  of  anxiety-related 
symptoms in 14 areas, with total scores ranging from 0 to 56. 
In  this  application,  some  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  used  to  support  the  primary  efficacy 
parameter of HAM-A change from baseline. Secondary efficacy parameters that were assessed in one 
or more of the controlled GAD studies (adult and elderly) included:  
change in HAM-A total score at each week of treatment;  
- 
HAM-A  responder  rate  (the  proportion  of  patients  having  a  ≥50%  reduction  from  baseline  to 
- 
endpoint in total HAM-A);  
Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Improvement  (CGI-I)  responder  rate  [the  proportion  of  patients 
with a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved)];  
onset of effect assessments;  
change  in  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HAM-D)  score.  In  some  studies  also  other 
secondary measures were used.

Physician  Withdrawal  Checklist  (PWC):  The  PWC  is  a  clinician-rated  instrument  that  measures  20 
common symptoms of withdrawal on a scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe); scores on the 
20  individual  items  are  summed  to  obtain  a  PWC  total  score  23.  The  PWC  was  used  to  determine 
whether patients experienced withdrawal symptoms during taper. 
3.1.b  Efficacy results 
The  efficacy  results  are  based  on  6  short-term  placebo  controlled  trials  (4-6  weeks),  1  short-term 
placebo controlled elderly study (8 weeks) and 1 long-term study (6 months). 
1. 
Short-term efficacy: HAM-A and HAM-D 
To substantiate short-term efficacy six placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies were conducted (Studies 
021, 025, 026 083, 085, and 087). The methodology of these studies was in most respects in line with 
the CHMP GAD guideline.  
The double-blind treatment period in the controlled adult studies was 4 to 6 weeks:  
- 
- 
4 weeks in four studies (Studies 021, 025, 026 and 083); 
and 6 weeks in the remaining two (Studies 085 and 087).  
Although  the  recently  issued  CHMP  guideline  (Note  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigation  of 
Medicinal  Products  for  Treatment  of  Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder  CPMP/EWP/4284/02) 
recommends that the duration of short-term trials for GAD should be at least 8 weeks, these studies 
were  planned  and  designed  during  the  period  (1998-1999)  prior  to  the  draft  CHMP  guideline 
(September 2003) and in line with the 4 to 6 weeks duration requirements for short-term GAD studies 
at the time. All but one of the six controlled adult GAD studies included a benzodiazepine or serotonin 
noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI)  active  validator:  lorazepam  in  Studies  021,  025,  026, 
alprazolam in Study 083 and venlafaxine in Study 087.  
The controlled elderly GAD study (study 090/152) had a double-blind treatment period of 8 weeks but 
no third arm.

1.a  Mean HAM-A improvement (see table 1 below): 
In all studies the mean HAM-A score was at baseline between 23 and 25 points indicating a moderate 
severity of GAD symptoms: 
- 
study 21 is presenting that lorazepam 6 mg given by TID (total daily dose, administered)  is a 
very effective in the treatment of GAD with a rather large magnitude of effect. Pregabalin 150 
mg given by TID and pregabalin 600 mg given by TID were  also superior to placebo but the 
magnitude of effect was modest. 
study 25 was a study with no assay sensitivity. All active treatments including lorazepam 6 mg 
were not superior to placebo. This study should be considered as a failure. 
In study 26 pregabalin 150 mg given by TID was not superior to placebo but pregabalin 600 mg 
given by TID and lorazepam 6 mg were significant superior to placebo with modest magnitudes 
of effect.  
All  active  treatments  in  study  83  were  superior  to  placebo  with  modest  magnitudes  of  effect. 
The same applies for studies 85, 87 and 090/152.

- 
1.b  HAM-A Responder results(see table 1 below): 
In  study  21  lorazepam  6mg  and  pregabalin  600  mg    given  by  TID  were  superior  to  placebo  but 
pregabalin 150 mg was not superior to placebo. 
Study  25  was  a  study  with  no  assay  sensitivity.  More  placebo  responders  than  lorazepam  6  mg 
responders. 
In study 26 pregabalin 600 mg  given by TID was superior to placebo but pregabalin 150 mg  given 
by TID and lorazepam 6mg were not significantly superior to placebo. 
Study 83 presented confusing results: pregabalin 300 mg  given by TID and pregabalin 600 mg were 
superior  to  placebo,  while  pregabalin  450  mg  given  by  TID  and  alprazolam  were  not  better  than 
placebo. Moreover the magnitude of effect of pregabalin 300 mg was the largest. 
All  active  treatments  except  pregabalin  600  mg  in  studies  85,  87  were  showing  a  statistically 
significant  difference  superior  to  placebo,  while  the  elderly  study  090/152  was  negative  for 
responders. 
All other (secondary) efficacy outcome measures were more or less in line with the primary outcome 
measures. 
Although  not  all  results  are  convincing,  it  can  be  that  short-term  efficacy  for  pregabalin  is 
demonstrated,  with  a  modest  magnitude  of  effect.  This  magnitude  is  comparable  to  other  medicinal 
products that have already been granted a Marketing Authorisation for the indication GAD.  
The MAH states that in the adult studies, patients with current diagnoses of any of the Axis I disorders 
of major depressive disorder (MDD), social phobia, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, acute 
stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anorexia, bulimia, and/or 
delirium, dementia, amnesic, and other clinically significant cognitive disorders, were excluded.  
Although  patients  with  an  MDD  diagnosis  (as  well  as  other  axis  I  disorders)  were  presumably 
excluded, baseline HAM-D scores are high (baseline HAM-D scores in the studies, indicate that the 
patients were having at least mild depressive symptoms on average). In addition, during the course of 
the  trials  considerable  improvements  in  HAM-D  were  observed.  In  most  studies  there  was  a 
statistically significant and clinical relevant improvement on the HAM- D that seem to be parallel with 
the improvement on the HAM-A. Therefore the CHMP requested the MAH to disentangle effect on 
anxiety from effect on depression i.e. to demonstrate that improvements in HAM-A scores are not due 
to improvement in HAM-D scores, request to be responded by examining the improvement in HAM-A 
while controlling for improvements in HAM-D; the question was whether improvements in HAM-A 
are statistically significant and clinically relevant once changes in depression scores are controlled for 
(whether  pregabalin  is  an  effective  compound  in  the  treatment  of  GAD  and  improving  depressive 
symptoms  is  secondary  or  that  it  is  mainly  effective  as  an  antidepressant  and  improving  GAD 
symptoms is secondary.)

The CHMP also requested the MAH to provided further information about:  
- 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria with respect to maximum total HAM-D scores and/or HAM-D 
item 1 scores. 
the  mean  and  spread  of  HAM-D  total  scores  and  HAM-D  item  1  scores  at  baseline  in  each 
study. 
- 
The MAH explained that the effect of pregabalin seen on reduction of anxiety in patients diagnosed 
with GAD was not due to improvement in depression: 
(cid:131)  Analysis  of  the  data  and  published  literature  show  that  HAM-A  and  HAM-D  total  scores  are 
highly  correlated  due  to  a  substantial  overlap  in  items  on  the  scales.  These  scales  are 
instruments that have been separately validated in patients who have either been diagnosed with 
anxiety (HAM-A) or depression (HAM-D). 
(cid:131)  Improvement in HAM-A is not consistently related to the HAM-D score at baseline. 
(cid:131)  Even  when  adjusting  for  the  changes  seen  in  HAM-D  scores  changes  in  HAM-A  still  favour 
pregabalin over placebo. 
(cid:131)  The  Mini-International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI)  a  validated  structured  psychiatric 
interview,  was  used  to  diagnose  patients  for  the  studies,  therefore  no  patients  with  major 
depression were included in the study (only patients with GAD were included). There were no 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for HAM-D scores specified in the protocols; however, the Raskin 
Depression Scale total score had to be ≤ 7 and the Covi Anxiety Scale total score ≥ 9 to insure 
predominance of anxiety symptoms over depression symptoms. 
(cid:131)  The mean and spread of HAM-D total scores at baseline were similar across treatment groups 
within  each  study  and  were  also  comparable  across  studies.    The  majority  of  patients  had 
baseline HAM-D Item 1 scores of 0 or 1. 
There is a high comorbidity between GAD and MDD and analysis of the data and published literature 
show  that  HAM-A  and  HAM-D  total  scores  are  highly  correlated.  The  GAD  CHMP  guideline 
recommends to include only patients with a low HAM-D score. Nevertheless in the pivotal studies the 
MAH  allowed  patients  with  at  least  mild  depressive  score  leading.  Moreover  because  the  HAM-D 
scores are treatment-dependent it cannot be properly used as a covariate in a model.  
Moreover  the  MAH  presented  data  showing  that  there  is  no  consistent  pattern  of  lower  or  higher 
HAM-D  baseline  having  greater  HAM-A  response.  The  MAH  also  presented  the  HAM-D  Item  1 
(depressed mood) at baseline (most patients had 0’s and 1 on this item (> 70%)).   
In view of the above it can be concluded that the comorbidity is an important issue in GAD, especially 
comorbidity with MDD. From the data submitted by  the MAH the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
effect seen on the HAM-A is not driven by an antidepressant effect. This question has therefore been 
resolved.

1.c  Dose 
The MAH initially proposed the following wording for section 4.2 of the SPC (Posology and Method 
of Administration): 
"The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two divided doses. 
Pregabalin  treatment  can  be  started  with  a  dose  of  150mg  per  day.  Based  on  individual  patient 
response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300mg per day after 1 week. Following an 
additional week the dosage may be increased to 450mg per day. The maximum dosage of 600 mg per 
day may be achieved after an additional week." 
To substantiate the BID (twice daily) dosage regimen the MAH stated that in Study 085, BID dosing 
with 200 and 400 mg/day achieved significant improvement of anxiety symptoms as measured by the 
change from baseline in HAM-A total scores compared with placebo. Both doses of pregabalin were 
also significantly better than placebo as measured by HAM-A responder rate changes from baseline in 
the  HAM-A  Psychic  Anxiety  and  Somatic  Anxiety  subscales  at  endpoint  and  Clinical  Global 
Impression of Change (CGIC) responder rate (see table 1). 
Effects  of  pregabalin  administered  BID  versus  TID  were  compared  by  looking  at  the  primary  and 
secondary efficacy results for 400 mg/day taken BID versus 450 mg/day taken three times daily (TID), 
and  for  600  mg/day  BID  versus  600  mg/day  TID.  In  general,  pregabalin  given  BID  produced 
comparable  effects  to  equivalent  TID  doses.  Based  on  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  (see  table  1), 
HAM-A  improvements  were  similar  for  both  400  mg/day  BID  and  450  mg/day  TID.  For  the  600 
mg/day dose, HAM-A improvements were similar for both regimes. In general, as with the HAM-A 
change  scores,  400  mg/day  BID  had  slightly  better  effects  on  the  secondary  parameters  than  450 
mg/day  TID.  For  600  mg/day,  TID  dosing  produced  slightly  better  effects  on  some  secondary 
parameters in some studies compared with 600 mg/day BID. 
In most studies pregabalin 450 mg/day taken TID does not seem to be an effective dose and also 600 
mg/day given by TID is not always better than placebo. A TID regimen does not seem to differ from a 
BID regimen concerning efficacy (see table1). Therefore the CHMP is the opinion that the proposed 
text by the MAH is acceptable. However, the general sentence in section 4.2 of the SPC stating that 
the  product  can  be  given  BID  or  TID  is  also  relevant  for  this  indication.  Therefore  the  following 
wording in the section 4.2 of the SPC is endorsed by the CHMP: 
"The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses.  The need for treatment 
should be reassessed regularly. 
Pregabalin  treatment  can  be  started  with  a  dose  of  150 mg  per  day.    Based  on  individual  patient 
response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after 1 week.  Following an 
additional week the dosage may be increased to 450 mg per day.  The maximum dosage of 600 mg per 
day may be achieved after an additional week." 
1.d  Early onset of action 
The MAH claimed that the effect of pregabalin is observed starting from week 1:  
“Relief  of  the  symptoms  of  GAD  as  reflected  by  the  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  was 
observed by Week 1.” 
The  time to Onset of Sustained HAM-A Improvement at 30% 
To substantiate this claim the MAH investigated the following: 
1. 
Time  to  onset  of  sustained  HAM-A  improvement  was  examined  in  several  short-term  studies. 
Sustained HAM-A improvement, defined as a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in HAM-A total score 
that is sustained for the remainder of the study, was compared between treatment groups. Comparisons 
were  done  using  log-rank  statistics  in  all  studies  except  for  Study  087,  which  used  the  Cox 
proportional hazards  model.  Every  pregabalin  treatment  group, except  for  pregabalin  400  mg/day  in 
Study  087,  demonstrated  a  significantly  shorter  time  to  onset  of  sustained  improvement  than  the 
placebo group at the 0.05 significance level.

The Early Onset of Effect 
2. 
Analyses  were  planned  to  examine  early  onset  of  effectiveness.  The  objective  was  to  investigate  if 
pregabalin  is  effective  in  providing  sustained  improvement  as  early  as  Week  1.  This  was  done  by 
comparing rates of sustained response (defined as a 30% or a 50% improvement in HAM-A at Week 1 
which  was  sustained  to  the  end  of  treatment)  between  placebo  and  each  active  treatment.  In  most 
cases,  for  both  the  30%  and  the  50%  criteria,  pregabalin  treatment  groups  achieved  statistical 
significance indicating that pregabalin is effective as early as Week 1 in treating GAD. 
For  those  comparisons  that  did  not  reach  statistical  significance,  the  responder  rates  for  pregabalin 
were  higher  than  placebo  for  all  but  1  comparison  (study  026,  150  mg/day).  The  elderly  study 
090/152did  not  achieve  statistical  significance.  However  it  should  be  noted  that  at  week  1,  patients 
were on 150 mg/day only for 3 days. 
The  MAH  did  the  analysis  on  the  Intention  to  Treat  (ITT)  population.  To  demonstrate  sustained 
response the completers should be analysed and secondary the ITT population. Moreover studies with 
a duration of 8 weeks are really necessary to substantiate this claim. Therefore, the CHMP considered 
that the early onset of action could not be granted upon this analysis and this question was addressed 
to the MAH.  
Two types of evaluations were performed: ‘Time to Onset’ and ‘Early Onset of Effect’: 
- 
The  first  evaluation,  time  to  onset  of  sustained  HAM-A  improvement,  supported  the  primary 
hypothesis  that  pregabalin  is  an  effective  treatment  and  consistently  leads  to  improvement 
earlier than placebo.  
The  latter  analyses  showed  that  pregabalin  is  effective  in  providing  sustained improvement  in 
the HAM-A total score as early as Week 1 of treatment. 
- 
In  response  to  the  CHMP’s  request  to  better  substantiate  sustained  response  of  pregabalin  by 
performing  analyses  on  the  completers,  the  MAH  has  evaluated  the  ‘Early  Onset  of  Effect’  on  this 
group  in  the  short-term  controlled  GAD  studies.  These  new  analyses  provided  further  evidence  that 
pregabalin provides sustained improvement in GAD as early as Week 1 of treatment. 
Regarding  the  duration  of  short-term  trials  in  the  GAD  programme,  although  the  recently  issued 
CHMP  guideline  CHMP/EWP/4284/02  recommends  that  the  duration  of  short-term  trials  for  GAD 
should be at least 8 weeks, the short-term studies in the clinical development programme were planned 
and  designed  during  the  period  1998-1999,  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  draft  CHMP  guidelines 
(September 2003) and in line with the 4 to 6 weeks duration requirements for short-term GAD studies 
at  the  time.  However  to  demonstrate  sustained  response  in  the  absence  of  short-term  studies  of  8 
weeks duration the MAH has analysed the sustained nature of the anti-anxiety response to pregabalin 
between  4  and  6  weeks  in  the  three  short-term  controlled  trials  of  greater  than  4  weeks  duration 
(Studies  085,  087  &  090/152).  By  exploring  the  temporal  relationship  of  the  response  it  can 
determined  if  there  is  any  evidence  that  the  effect  seen  in  these  studies  would  be  compromised  in 
longer studies. This was accomplished by plotting the change at Week 4 versus the change at Week 6 
for patients with both a Week 4 and Week 6 change score. The sustained response data between 6 and 
8 weeks in the controlled elderly study, Study 90/152 was investigated in a similar manner. 
Studies  085,  087  and  090/152  demonstrate  that  the  Week  4  HAM-A  change  scores  of  patients  on 
pregabalin  are  highly  predictive  of  their  Week  6  HAM-A  change  scores  in  all  of  the  three  studies. 
These  figures  demonstrate  that  the  effect  seen  at  Week  6  is  very  similar  to  that  seen  at  Week  4  for 
most patients.  
The  MAH  presented  the  completers  analysis  (see  table  2)  as  an  addition  to  the  ITT  analysis  and 
demonstrated that early onset of effect globally occurred more in the active compound groups than in 
the placebo-groups. Moreover in the study where venlafaxine - 75 mg  BID (Study 087) was used as 
an  active  comparator  pregabalin  600  mg/  day  (BID)  showed  early  onset  of  effect  in  contrast  to 
venlafaxine 75 mg.

Although the answer from the MAH concerning the duration of the short-term studies (< 8 weeks may 
be too short to demonstrate early onset of effect) did not seem very relevant (no reduction of effect 
between 4 weeks and 6 weeks) the CHMP considers that the above-mentioned objection is resolved. 
The claim in section 5.1: “Relief of the symptoms of GAD as reflected by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating 
Scale (HAM-A) was observed by Week 1” is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2. 
Long-term efficacy 
Pregabalin’s  maintenance  of  efficacy  was  evaluated  in  a  randomized,  double-blind,  fixed-dose, 
placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  multicenter  study  that  followed  a  standard  relapse  prevention 
design.  
2.a 
Study design 
The study consisted of 4 phases (see figure 10 below): 
• 
• 
• 
a 1-week screening phase, 
a 8-week open-label acute phase in which all patients received pregabalin,  
a  6-month  double-blind  maintenance  phase  in  which  patients  received  either  placebo  or 
pregabalin 450 mg/day, and 
a 2-week discontinuation assessment phase. 
• 
10/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the start of the open-label phase, patients received 300 mg/day (total daily dose, administered TID) 
for  the  first  3  days  and  450  mg/day  (TID)  for  4  days.  Dosage  adjustments  for  intolerance  could  be 
made during the second week of treatment only. Any patient who could not tolerate the 450 mg/day 
dose by the end of Week 2 was discontinued from the study.  
For  the  remainder  of  the  open-label  phase,  all  patients  received  the  fixed  dose  of  450  mg/day 
pregabalin. If patients met the entry criteria (HAM-A total score ≤ 11 and ≥ 50% reduction from open-
label  baseline  in  HAM-A  total  score  at  2  of  the  last  3  open-label  visits)  for  the  double-blind 
maintenance phase, they were then randomly assigned to placebo or pregabalin.  
The initial double-blind treatment for patients randomized to placebo was a taper from pregabalin (300 
mg/day for 3 days). Double-blind treatment continued for up to 6 months or until patients met study 
exit criteria.  
In the discontinuation phase, study medication was reduced to 300 mg/day (TID) for 3 days before it 
was  discontinued.  Patients  who  discontinued  or  completed  the  double-blind  phase  were  eligible  to 
enroll in the open-label Study 084. 
2.b  Patient population 
Eligible patients were men or nonpregnant women, ≥ 18 years of age with the diagnosis of GAD who 
were  recruited  from  the  general  outpatient  population.  The  primary  parameter  was  time  to  relapse. 
Relapse was defined as removal of the patient from the double-blind maintenance phase for any of the 
following 3 reasons: 
1. 
fulfillment  of  the  study  entry  criteria  of  observer-rated  HAM-A  (≥  20)  and  Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI)  diagnostic  criteria  of  GAD  (excluding  duration)  at  2 
successive visits 1 week apart;  
a score of “much worse” (score of 6) or “very much worse” (score of 7) on the CGI-I scale 
and meeting the criteria (excluding duration) for GAD assessed by the MINI at 2 successive 
visits 1 week apart; or 
worsening anxiety symptoms such that immediate intervention was needed per the clinical 
judgment of the principal investigator. 
2. 
3. 
Patients  who  completed  6  months  of  treatment,  patients  who  were  withdrawn  for  other  reasons 
(adverse  events,  noncompliance,  withdrew  consent,  other/administrative  reasons),  and  patients  who 
were lost to follow up were categorized as “not relapsed”.

2.c  Analysis 
For  the  primary  analysis,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time  to  relapse  of  GAD  were  calculated 
separately  for  the  placebo  and  pregabalin  treatment  groups.  The  treatment  groups  were  compared 
using  the  log-rank  statistic.  Observations  were  treated  as  right-censored  for  patients  who  completed 
the 6-month double-blind maintenance phase or who withdrew early due to non-compliance, adverse 
events, withdrawal of consent, other/administrative reasons, or who were lost to follow-up. 
A total of 859 patients were screened, 624 entered the open-label phase, 339 entered the double-blind 
phase  and  239  completed  the  double-blind  phase  (see  table  23  below).  Two  hundred  thirty  five 
patients  entered  and  205  completed  the  discontinuation  phase.  The  ITT  population  comprised  338 
patients since one of the 339 randomized patients did not take study medication.  
During the 6-month double-blind maintenance phase, time to relapse of GAD was significantly  longer 
for patients treated with pregabalin than placebo (p = 0.0001). A total of 111 (65%) of placebo-treated 
patients relapsed compared with 71 (42%) of pregabalin-treated patients (see figure 11 below).  
Based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time-to-event,  25%  of  placebo-treated  patients  had  relapsed  by 
Day  14  whereas  25%  of  the  pregabalin  patients  had  relapsed  by  Day  25  and  50%  of  the  placebo 
patients had relapsed by Day 23 whereas, by Day 116, 50% of pregabalin group still had not relapsed. 
12/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For  the  placebo  group,  the  last  relapse  was  on  Day  153,  at  this  time  there  were  23  patients  left  of 
whom 21 completed 6 months of treatment. In the pregabalin group the last relapse was on Day 116, at 
this  time  there  were  50  patients  left  of  whom  36  completed  6  months  of  treatment.  A  secondary 
analysis  expanding  the  definition  of  relapse  was  carried  out.  In  addition  to  the  patients  defined  as 
relapsers  in  the  primary  analysis,  patients  who  withdrew  due  to  an  adverse  event  (AE)  or 
noncompliance  were  categorized  as  relapsers.  Using  these  criteria,  time  to  relapse  was  significantly 
longer in the pregabalin treatment group compared with placebo. Results are presented in the table 24 
below. 
In Study 088, the secondary endpoints of HAM-A change score, HAM-D change score and Clinical 
Global  Impression  of  Severity  (CGI-S)  were  analyzed  using  an  ANCOVA  statistical  model;  CGI-I 
responder  analysis  was  assessed  by  logistic  regression.  At  endpoint,  treatment  differences  from 
placebo  were  –4.64,  -2.68,  -0.63  for  the  HAM-A  change  score,  HAM-D  change  score  and  CGI-S, 
respectively. Each result was statistically different from placebo (p <0.0002). 
At  endpoint,  64%  of  the  placebo  patients  were  CGI-I  non  responders  versus  43%  of  the  pregabalin 
group. A post hoc analysis of time to relapse was performed using a definition of relapse, which takes 
into consideration the possible confounding of medication discontinuation effects, and relapse during 
the first 2 weeks of the double-blind phase. Relapse was defined as in the primary analysis with the 
following exceptions:  
13/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
all  patients  removed  from  the  double-blind  phase  for  any  reason  during  the  first  week  were 
considered non-relapsers; 
patients removed from the double-blind phase during the second week were considered to have 
relapsed only if the reason for withdrawal was “investigator judgment.”  
Using  this  definition,  time  to  relapse  continued  to  be  significantly  longer  for  patients  treated  with 
pregabalin 450 mg/day compared with placebo (p=0.0008). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of time-
to-event, 25% of placebo-treated patients relapsed by Day 22 compared with Day 35 for the pregabalin 
group. 
Based on the above data the long-term efficacy was not shown unequivocally. The MAH claimed that 
relapse  prevention  was  demonstrated  by  means  of  a  well-conducted  placebo  controlled  relapse 
prevention study with duration of the double blind period of 6 months. The CHMP is of the opinion 
that this study was positive for the relapse criteria as defined in the study. However, the third reason 
for  relapse  was:  worsening  anxiety  symptoms  such  that  immediate  intervention  was  needed  per  the 
clinical judgment of the principal investigator. This criterion seemed to be the largest contribution to 
the positive result of this study.  The CHMP guideline, however, states that "worsening or relapse has 
to  be  defined  in  the  protocol  and  should  be  a  clinical  relevant  increase  of  symptoms,  scored  on  a 
validated rating scale at one or more visits."  
Reason 1 (HAMA/MINI criteria) seemed to comply with the CHMP guideline criterion. 19 % of the 
placebo  treated  patients  relapsed  according  to  this  criterion,  while  14%  of  the  pregabalin  patients 
relapsed.  To  overcome  this  result  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  submit  the  HAM-A  data  of  all 
patients at relapse and use that for a new relapse analysis: the MAH was requested to find out, analyse 
and  submit  the  data  related  to  what  the  HAM-A/  CGI-I  score  was  at  the  moment  the  investigator 
judged  that  the  patient  was  taken  out  of  the  study,  in  order  to  conclude  on  the  concerning  relapse 
prevention.  In  addition,  an  analysis  in  which  all  patients  removed  from  the  study  during  the  first  2 
weeks of the double blind period would not be considered as relapsers was requested by the CHMP.  
i) 
Analysis of the HAM-A data of all patients at relapse (new relapse analysis): 
The MAH responded that in the long-term relapse prevention study (Study 088), relapse was defined 
as patient discontinuation from the double-blind maintenance phase for any of the following 3 reasons: 
1. 
Fulfilling study entry criteria of observer-rated HAM-A (≥ 20) and Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic criteria of GAD (excluding duration) at 2 
successive visits 1 week apart; 
Score of “much worse” (score of 6) or “very much worse” (score of 7) from double-blind 
baseline on the CGI-I and meeting diagnostic criteria (excluding duration) for GAD as 
assessed by the MINI at 2 successive visits 1 week apart; 
2. 
3.  Worsening anxiety symptoms that necessitated immediate intervention per the clinical 
judgment of the principal investigator. 
In  view  of  the  concern  raised  by  the  CHMP  regarding  investigator  judgement  as  a  method  for 
diagnosis of relapse, the MAH has performed analyses using the HAM-A score as a sole measure for 
determining relapse. Relapse was defined as the first occurrence of HAM-A total score ≥ 20 excluding 
baseline and follow-up as per the CHMP guidelines. Investigator judgment and CGI-C scores were not 
considered reasons for relapse. This definition is the same as the first criteria specified above with the 
exception that there is not the requirement of confirmation at 2 successive visits. 
Results  of  this  analysis  demonstrate  that  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  time–to- 
relapse  for  pregabalin  compared  to  placebo  (p<0.0001).  Overall  relapse  occurred  earlier  and  more 
frequently in the placebo group (see figure a and table b below). 
14/34

Using  HAM–A  scores  ≥  20  as  the  sole  criteria  for  relapse  in  Study  088,  58%  of  the  placebo  group 
relapsed (99/170 patients) compared to only 40% in the pregabalin group (67/168 patients). Table b 
below provides a summary of the Kaplan Meier estimates of time to relapse of GAD, where relapse is 
defined as a HAM-A score ≥ 20.

Table b -  Summary of Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Time-to-Relapse of GAD. 
Relapse Defined as First Occurrence of HAM- ≥ 20 in Study 088 
For patients who were determined to be relapsed by investigator judgment, the majority had HAM-A 
scores  ≥  20.  This  data,  summarised  in  table  c  below,  describes  the  frequency  and  percentage  of 
patients having HAM-A≥ 20 or CGI-C scores ≥ 6 at time of relapse for each protocol-defined relapse 
status/reason.  The  “investigator  judgment”  relapse  decision  is  very  strongly  linked  to  a  relevant 
increase  of  symptoms,  scored  on  a  validated  rating  scale,  as  indicated  by  the  large  proportion  of 
patients with HAM-A scores > 20. These summaries demonstrate that for all reasons the relapse were 
consistently based on clinical relevant increase of symptoms, scored on a validated rating scale at one 
or more visits.

ii) 
Analysis in which patients removed from the study during the first 2 weeks of the double blind 
period would not be considered as relapsers: 
An  analysis  that  did  not  consider  patients  as  relapsers  during  the  first  two  weeks  was  conducted  as 
requested  by  the  CHMP.  This  analysis  censored  patients  who  either  dropped  out  of  the  study  or  
relapsed  during  the  first  two  weeks  and  demonstrates  that  there  was  a  statistically  significant 
difference in time to relapse for pregabalin compared to placebo (p<0.0142).  
Using  HAM-A  scores  ≥  20  as  the  sole  criteria  for  relapse  and  removing  all  patients  who  were 
withdrawn  during  the  first  two  weeks  of  double-blind,  41%  of  the  placebo  group  relapsed  (41/101 
patients)  compared  to  only  28%  of  the  pregabalin  group  (39/138  patients).  Overall  relapse  occurred 
earlier and more frequently in the placebo group (see table d and figure 2 below). This analysis shows 
that the long-term efficacy seen on pregabalin is evident even when the early relapsers are excluded. 
Table d -  Relapse Defined as First Occurrence of HAM ≥ 20 After Second Week of Double 
Blind in Study 088 
The  MAH  concluded  that  these  additional  analyses  of  relapse  prevention  data  in  Study  088  using 
HAM-A scores ≥ 20 as the sole criterion for relapse, further demonstrate that pregabalin is effective in 
preventing relapse of GAD, and maintaining both symptom reduction and improved functioning when 
given  for  up  to  6  months.  In  addition,  the  MAH  stated  that  most  patients  who  relapsed  based  on 
investigator judgment indicated clinical relevant increases of symptoms. 
By  means  of  the  above-mentioned  analyses  that  complete  the  original  analysis,  the  CHMP  is  of  the 
opinion that the relapse prevention was sufficiently demonstrated for pregabalin in GAD.  
3.2  Clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  the  product  is  based  on  the  AEs  reported  in  the  previous  mentioned  clinical 
studies:

3.2.a  AEs in the short-term studies 
The table 17 below presents the adverse events for the adult GAD studies. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events in pregabalin treated subjects during the 
short-term controlled adult GAD studies were CNS events: mainly dizziness and somnolence. These 
two  adverse  events  were  the  two  most  frequent  severe  events  reported  and  were  the  most  frequent 
adverse  events  associated  with  discontinuation  (see  table  17).  Somnolence  was  also  the  most 
frequently  reported  treatment-related  adverse  event  reported  for  lorazepam  (53.4%)  and  alprazolam 
(41.9%), although nausea was the most frequently reported event for venlafaxine (27.4%). The pattern 
of frequently reported adverse events in pregabalin treated subjects with GAD was similar to that seen 
in  the  overall  safety  database  for  the  randomised  controlled  pregabalin  studies  for  all  indications 
(reported in the original MAA) i.e. the adverse reactions summarised in Section 4.8 of the currently 
approved SPC.  
Adverse events, whether treatment related or not, that were reported with an incidence of at least 5% 
and  with  a  higher  incidence  than  placebo  in  the  controlled  adult  GAD  studies  are  dizziness, 
somnolence, dry mouth, asthenia, amblyopia, peripheral oedema, thinking abnormal and weight gain. 
This was similar for both the controlled studies for all indications (original MAA) and the controlled 
adult  GAD  studies.  Few  adverse  events  were  considered  to  be  severe  in  intensity  in  either  study 
populations.  Therefore  the  adverse  event  profile  in  controlled  adult  GAD  studies  as  stated  above  is 
similar to that of the controlled studies in all indications that was presented in the original MAA. 
As  in  the  overall  database  of  controlled  pregabalin  studies  in  all  indications  (original  MAA),  the 
incidence  of  treatment  related  adverse  events  in  the  150  mg/day  pregabalin  treatment  group  in  the 
controlled  adult  GAD  studies  was  similar  to  that  seen  with  placebo.  Although  dizziness  and 
somnolence  were  the  most  common  adverse  events,  the  incidence  was  varied  with  no  clear 
relationship to dose or regimen. The profile of treatment related adverse events in the controlled adult 
GAD  studies  was  very  similar  to  the  treatment  related  adverse  event  profile  of  pregabalin  in  the 
controlled  pregabalin  studies  in  all  indications  presented  in  the  original  MAA.  Dry  mouth  occurred 
more frequently in the GAD patient population than in the other study populations (neuropathic pain 
and  epilepsy),  whereas  peripheral  oedema,  unlike  in  the  neuropathic  pain  population,  was  not  a 
common adverse event in the GAD population. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  adverse  events  in  the  short-term  studies  are  well-known  pregabalin 
adverse  events.  However  symptoms  like  depersonalistion,  euphoria,  nervousness,  abnormal  thinking 
and  amnesia  may  reflect  benzodiazepine  -like  adverse  events.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  explain 
these  symptoms  more  extensively  and  explain  why  pregablin  should  not  be  considered  as  a 
benzodiazephine-like compound. This question was addressed by the CHMP to the MAH along with 
additional questions on the rebound effect (see below item vi, paragraph 5 of section 3.3.2.b)

1. 
Controlled study in elderly GAD (Study 090/152) 
Although the adverse event profile for the short-term controlled elderly GAD study (Study 090/152) 
was similar to short-term controlled adult GAD studies, the incidence of the common adverse events 
were  lower  in  Study 090/152.  The  flexible  dosing  regime  used  in  the  controlled  elderly  GAD  study 
may  explain  this  reduced  incidence.  The  most  common  treatment-related  adverse  events  reported 
during  Study  090/152  were  CNS  events:  mainly  dizziness  and  somnolence,  the  incidences  of  which 
were much less in the elderly study. The incidence of dizziness in Study 090/152 was 16.4% compared 
with 30.2% in the controlled pregabalin adult GAD studies. Like wise the incidence of somnolence in 
Study 090/152 was 13.0% compared with 28.6% in the controlled adult GAD studies. 
2. 
Controlled study in elderly GAD vs Elderly patients in Controlled studies in all 
Indications 
The safety profile of Study 090/152 was also very similar to that seen in the patients who were ≥65 yrs 
of  age  in  the  controlled  pregabalin  studies  in  all  indications,  most  of  whom  were  patients  with 
neuropathic  pain  (original  MAA).  The  majority  of  all  causality  events  were  reported  at  a  lower 
frequency  in  pregabalin  patients  in  controlled  elderly  GAD  (Study  090/152)  compared  with  elderly 
patients in controlled pregabalin studies in all indications (original MAA). 
3. 
Discontinuations due to Adverse Events 
Similar percentages of placebo- and pregabalin-treated patients completed the controlled adult GAD 
studies  (74%  and  77%,  respectively).  The  proportion  of  subjects  withdrawing  early  from  the 
controlled  adult  GAD  studies  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  placebo  and  pregabalin  groups  was  also 
similar (9.3% and 11.3%, respectively).  
The  most  frequent  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  in  all  pregabalin-treated  patients  in  the 
controlled adult GAD studies were somnolence (4%) and dizziness (2.5%); in these studies all other 
adverse events that led to discontinuation occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1% in all pregabalin-treated 
patients.  There  did  not  appear  to  be  any  clear  pregabalin  dose-response  on  the  frequency  of 
discontinuations;  however,  the  withdrawal  rate  in  patients  treated  with  pregabalin  600  mg/day  was 
almost twice that in patients treated with any other dose of pregabalin.  
Similar percentages of placebo and pregabalin-treated patients completed the controlled elderly GAD 
study (72% and 75%, respectively). The proportion of subjects withdrawing early from the controlled 
elderly GAD study due to adverse events in the placebo and pregabalin groups was also similar (9.4% 
and 10.7%, respectively), and overall this was similar to that seen in the controlled adult GAD studies. 
Pregabalin is tolerated as well in the elderly population as it is in the younger population. 
As  in  the  controlled  adult  studies,  the  most  frequent  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  in  all 
pregabalin-treated  patients  in  the  controlled  elderly  GAD  study  (Study  090/152)  were  dizziness  (8 
patients, 4.5%) and somnolence (2 patients, 1%).  
4. 
Discontinuation Emergent Adverse Events and PWC data 
The  potential  discontinuation  effects  of  pregabalin  were  investigated  in  the  GAD  studies  using 
discontinuation  emergent  signs  and  symptoms  (DESS)  and  the  Physician’s  Withdrawal  Checklist 
(PWC). 
Adverse  events  appearing  during  taper  of  study  drug  and  up  to  2  weeks  after  this  were  termed 
discontinuation  emergent  and  assessed  in  the  DESS  evaluation.  If  an  adverse  event  occurred  with 
greater  severity  during  the  2  week  follow-up  period,  this  was  also  termed  discontinuation  emergent 
and  was  counted  in  the  DESS  assessment.  In  the  short-term  controlled  adult  GAD  studies,  the 
18/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentage of pregabalin-treated patients with at least one DESS adverse event (16.3%) was low and 
similar to that of placebo-treated patients (12.6%).  
PWC  data  were  evaluated  prospectively  in  the  controlled  adult  GAD  studies.  The  PWC,  which  was 
developed  specifically  to  measure  symptoms  of  benzodiazepine  withdrawal,  rates  20  common 
symptoms  of  withdrawal  and  was  used  to  determine  whether  patients  experienced  withdrawal 
symptoms  after  cessation  of  study  medication.  The  symptoms  measured  are  based  on  those  that  are 
potentially  related  to  benzodiazepine  withdrawal:  gastrointestinal,  mood,  sleep,  motor,  somatic, 
perception and cognition. 
In  the  table  below  (table  2)  the  most  relevant  results  of  the  PWC  in  the  short-term  studies  are 
presented.  The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  below  results  indicate  that  pregabalin  causes 
withdrawal symptoms.

Serious Adverse Events (Controlled GAD Studies (Adults & Elderly): 
The  frequency  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  pregabalin  treatment  groups  in  the  controlled  adult 
GAD  studies  was  low  (0%  to  1.8%;  overall  0.6%),  and  comparable  to  the  placebo  group  (1.2%). 
Serious adverse events frequency did not increase with increased pregabalin dose. One serious adverse 
event,  accidental  injury,  was  reported  by  2  pregabalin-treated  patients.  The  other  serious  adverse 
events  reported  by  pregabalin-treated  patients  were  anxiety,  bone  pain,  cardiomyopathy,  dizziness, 
gastrointestinal  disorder,  and  myocardial  infarction.  There  were  no  deaths  in  any  of  the  controlled 
adult GAD studies. The frequency of treatment-related serious adverse events in the controlled adult 
GAD studies was similar between placebo and pregabalin. 
The  overall  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  controlled  elderly  GAD  study  was  similar 
between  the  pregabalin  treated  patients  (4%)  compared  with  the  placebo  treated  patients  (3%).  The 
serious adverse events reported by the pregabalin  treated patients were accidental injury, chest pain, 
cerebral  haemorrhage,  palpitation,  vascular  disorder,  ventricular  tachycardia,  anxiety,  dizziness, 
somnolence  and  skin  ulcer.  The  patient  who  suffered  from  a  cerebral  haemorrhage  died  but  the 
investigator did not consider the event to be related to pregabalin treatment.

3.2.b  Adverse events in Long-Term GAD Studies (Studies 088, 084 &100):  
1. 
GAD - long-term safety 
Study 088 
i) 
The  long-term  safety  of  GAD  has  been  assessed  in  Study  088,  in  which  up  to  8  months  pregabalin 
treatment was administered: 8 weeks open-label, before randomisation to either pregabalin or placebo 
for up to 6 months.  
The incidence of CNS adverse events in the open-label phase of Study 088 was similar to that of the 
six  controlled  adult  GAD  studies,  with  the  most  common  adverse  events  (>10%)  of:  somnolence, 
dizziness,  dry  mouth,  euphoria,  weight  gain,  headache,  incoordination,  infection  and  thinking 
abnormal. 
For  most  adverse  events,  there  did  not  seem  to  be  an  increase  in  risk  with  continued  pregabalin 
treatment, as the incidence of all adverse events was lower in the double-blind phase compared with 
open-label  phase.  Adverse  events  that  started  during  the  double-blind  phase  and  had  a  higher 
incidence  among  pregabalin-treated  patients  than  in  open-label  included  infection,  sinusitis  and 
somnolence.  In  addition,  some  events  that  occurred  in  <5%  of  patients,  were  reported  with  higher 
frequency  in  the  pregabalin  treatment  group:  weight  gain,  back  pain,  depression,  amblyopia  and 
paraesthesia.  The  incidence  of  dizziness  in  this  phase  of  the  study  was  markedly  reduced  in 
comparison with the open-label phase, being reported in 4.2% of pregabalin-treated patients compared 
with 2.9% of placebo-treated patients. 
DESS  were  also  assessed  in  Study  088  and  were  assessed  in  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study 
(including  the  3-day  taper  off  medication  for  subjects  switching  from  pregabalin  to  placebo).  These 
DESS were measured in patients not relapsing, therefore with long exposure to pregabalin (8 months). 
The incidence of DESS was similar between placebo (18.8%) and pregabalin (17.9%) and was similar 
to that observed in the short-term studies. 
PWC change scores were also assessed in Study 088, and scores of 2.05 and 1.87 were observed at the 
first  and  second  follow-up  visits,  respectively  after  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  at  450 
mg/day.  This  was  statistically  significantly  different  from  placebo,  the  difference  at  both  follow-up 
visits was comparable to the scores noted after short-term treatment.  
The CHMP is of the opinion that the long-term PWC results, like the short-term results indicate that 
pregabalin may cause withdrawal symptoms after stopping. 
Other Studies – 084 and 100 
ii) 
Seven  hundred  and  ninety  seven  patients  from  the  controlled  adult  and  elderly  studies  entered  the 
open-label  studies  (084  &  100),  which  make  up  the  uncontrolled  GAD  studies.  Within  this 
uncontrolled GAD studies the patient population was split according to age for the safety assessment. 
In  patients  ≥  65  yrs  of  age,  157/683  patients  (23%)  had  not  been  previously  exposed  to  pregabalin. 
Overall, the adverse event profile in the patients ≥ 65 yrs of age in these studies was similar to that of 
the  controlled  adult  GAD  studies.  Although  dizziness  and  somnolence  were  again  the  two  most 
common adverse events, the incidences were lower in these studies than the controlled adult studies. 
As  patients  were  dosed  flexibly  in  the  open-label  studies,  guided  by  the  physician’s  clinical 
assessment  of  efficacy  and  tolerability,  this  might  have  contributed  to  the  apparent  improved 
tolerability.  The  adverse  event  profile  in  the  patients  ≥  65  yrs  of  age  was  similar  to  that  of  the 
controlled  adult  GAD  studies.  Dizziness  and  somnolence  had  similar  incidences  to  the  younger  age 
group and lower than that of the controlled adult studies.

2. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In Study 088, 2 patients (0.3%) experienced serious adverse events during open-label treatment and 3 
patients  (1.8%),  all  pregabalin-treated,  experienced  serious  adverse  events  during  the  double-blind 
phase.  The  serious  adverse  events  (preferred  terms)  that  occurred  during  pregabalin  treatment  were 
cardiovascular  disorder,  ovarian  cancer,  grand  mal  convulsion,  breast  carcinoma,  and  hernia  (one 
each). One patient, who later entered treatment and received placebo during double-blind, experienced 
a serious adverse event (pancreatitis) during screening. None of these adverse events were considered 
related to treatment. 
The  overall  frequency  of  serious  adverse  events  in  uncontrolled  Adult  GAD  (Studies  084  &  100) 
patients  was  3.5%,  (24/683  patients).  Overdose  was  the  only  SAE  reported  in  more  than  one 
pregabalin  patient.  The  pattern  of  these  SAEs  was  generally  reflective  of  the  pattern  in  the  overall 
combined  controlled  and  uncontrolled  GAD  studies  (mainly  cardiac,  vascular,  or  CNS  events  and 
carcinomas). Three SAEs (0.4%) were considered related to pregabalin treatment in uncontrolled adult 
GAD patients (neoplasm, rectal disorder and convulsion). 
3. 
Deaths 
In the pregabalin GAD clinical program there were 3 deaths in total. One patient each died in Study 
090/152,  Study  181  and  in  Study  100.  None  of  these  deaths  were  considered  to  be  related  to 
pregabalin  treatment.  However  no  details  about  these  deaths  were  available  for  assessment.  The 
overall incidence of death was 0.14% or 4.2 deaths per 1000 patient years. 
4. 
GAD Studies – Other Safety Parameters 
The results of the clinical  laboratory analyses for controlled GAD studies  were comparable to those 
for the overall profile of pregabalin presented in the original MAA. Overall, few GAD patients met the 
MAH-defined very high or very low laboratory criteria during the controlled or open-label studies. 
As  with  the  overall  vital  sign  profile  observed  with  pregabalin,  there  were  no  clinically  significant 
changes observed specifically in the GAD population. The results of the analyses of change in body 
weight are consistent with the overall safety profile of pregabalin presented previously in the original 
MAA. 
In general, there were no clinically significant ECG findings in any of the GAD studies, similar to the 
overall product safety profile noted across all indications. 
3.2.c  Special safety topics 
The  CHMP  guidance  on  generalised  anxiety  disorder  identifies  a  number  of  adverse  reactions  of 
particular  interest  for  medicinal  products  intended  for  the  treatment  of  generalized  anxiety  disorder, 
such  as  rebound/withdrawal/dependence,  key  central  nervous  system  adverse  reactions  and  those  of 
other  body  systems.  These  events  were  considered  within  the  initial  MAA  for  pregabalin  in  the 
treatment of neuropathic pain and partial seizures.  
Review of the current safety data from the overall  GAD development programme has not identified 
any clinically significant differences in the profile of these events within the GAD patient population 
compared  with  the  neuropathic  pain  and  partial  seizure  patient  populations.  The  additional  events 
reviewed  below  are  those,  which  are  considered  most  pertinent  to  this  application  and  the  intended 
patient population.

Oedema 
1. 
Oedema, which is mainly peripheral oedema, is associated with the use of pregabalin. Importantly, it 
is not clearly indicative of any underlying changes in renal or cardiac function, and does appear to be 
responsive to diuretic therapy. GAD patients do not seem to have an increased incidence of oedema 
compared with some other patient populations e.g. neuropathic pain. 
2.  Weight gain 
As presented in the original Marketing Authorisation application, pregabalin associated weight gain is 
time and dose dependent. It is more likely with the higher doses of pregabalin, it remains with chronic 
therapy  and  ceases,  or  reverses,  on  discontinuing  therapy.  Weight  gain  in  pregabalin  treated  GAD 
patients was similar to that seen in pregabalin treated patients in all indications (original MAA). In the 
integrated  safety  database,  there  was  no  evidence  of  sustained  changes  in  blood  pressure  or  glucose 
dysregulation,  no  evidence  of  any  drug-drug  or  drug-disease  interaction  and  1%  of  patients 
discontinued  treatment  because  of  weight  gain.  Most  patients  did  not  gain  more  than  10%  of  their 
baseline  weight  whilst  on  therapy;  however,  weight  gain  of  greater  than  25%  occurred  in 
approximately  1%  of  patients.  Patients  experiencing  weight  gain  may  be  at  greater  risk  for  obesity 
related morbidities.  
Dependence potential, tolerance and withdrawal 
3. 
Drugs  that  are  active  in  the  central  nervous  system  are  sometimes  associated  with  withdrawal 
symptoms  after  discontinuation  of  treatment.  In  some  cases,  withdrawal  symptoms  can  lead  to 
potential  for  dependence  as  patients  attempt  to  avert  the  unpleasant  discontinuation  symptoms.  The 
presence of discontinuation symptoms is not always a precursor to dependence. As an analgesic and 
anxiolytic agent, pregabalin has been investigated extensively for any dependence or abuse potential in 
a  specific  clinical  study  and  in  preclinical  models.  In  addition,  withdrawal  and  discontinuation 
symptoms have been examined in the clinical studies, as well as tolerance, to ensure a comprehensive 
review of any potential signals for dependence.  
In  animal  studies,  pregabalin  did  not  produce  the  subjective  and  reinforcing  effects  associated  with 
drugs  of  abuse.  Specifically  with  regard  to  subjective  effects,  pregabalin  did  not  produce 
benzodiazepine-like  discriminative  stimulus  effects  in  rhesus  monkeys  trained  to  discriminate 
midazolam  from  vehicle,  nor  did  it  maintain  IV  self-administration  in  rhesus  monkeys.  Unlike 
morphine,  pregabalin  did  not  induce  conditioned  place  preference  or  drug  discrimination  in  rats, 
suggesting low reinforcing effects. 
The  subjective  effects  of  pregabalin  were  evaluated  in  a  study  conducted  in  15  recreational 
alcohol/sedative  users.  This  was  a  single  dose  crossover  study  with  5  treatment  arms  –  placebo, 
diazepam 15 mg, diazepam 30 mg, pregabalin 200 mg, and pregabalin 450 mg. Pregabalin did produce 
subjective effects on a wide variety of measures that were different than placebo as would be expected 
from any psychotherapeutic agent. However, the pregabalin responses were divergent from 
those seen with diazepam and indicate that pregabalin does not share a profile of abuse liability similar 
to benzodiazepines. 
The  lack  of  any  dependence  or  abuse  signal  from  the  gabapentin  post-marketing  database  provides 
confidence  that  pregabalin  would  similarly  not  be  associated  with  abuse  or  dependence.  For 
thoroughness,  the  pregabalin  database  has  been  examined  extensively  for  any  signs  of  dependence 
potential in accordance with established indicators. 
Tolerance 
4. 
Tolerance is defined as loss of pharmacological effect despite constant dosing of a drug. Tolerance to 
the therapeutic effect of a compound may contribute to the potential for misuse of the compound when 
it  is  marketed.  Patients  who  experience  tolerance  may  inappropriately,  and  perhaps  without  medical 
supervision, escalate their medication dose in an attempt to re-establish the drug effect. 
The  possible  development  of  tolerance  was  analysed  in  the  neuropathic  pain  studies  because  they 
provided the most extensive open-label long-term treatment data. 
22/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although open-label data are available for GAD and provide some data for interpretation on tolerance, 
the  neuropathic  pain  population  was  considered  more  likely  to  develop  measurable  tolerance  and 
possibly abuse. 
No  evidence  of  significant  dose  escalation  was  detected  in  these  patients,  suggesting  that  tolerance 
does not develop to the analgesic effects of pregabalin. Similarly, in the open-label psychiatric Studies 
084 and 100, subjects did not escalate their doses, which can be interpreted as a lack of tolerance to 
the anxiolytic effects of pregabalin. 
Discontinuation Phenomena 
5. 
The  two  specific  measures  previously  defined  (DESS  and  PWC)  prospectively  allow  to  investigate 
potential  withdrawal  symptoms.  DESS  data  were  analysed  prospectively  in  the  controlled  GAD 
studies and in DPN Study 040. PWC data were evaluated prospectively in the controlled adult GAD 
studies. 
Adverse  events  appearing  during  taper  of  study  drug  and  up  to  2  weeks  after  this  were  termed 
discontinuation emergent and assessed in the DESS analysis. If an adverse event occurred with greater 
severity during the 2 week follow-up period, this was also termed discontinuation emergent and was 
counted in the DESS assessment. For the post hoc assessment of the full 49-study dataset, DESS were 
defined as any adverse event that began or increased in intensity within 10 days after the last full dose 
of  study  medication.  In  the  healthy  volunteer  Study  072,  withdrawal  emergent  signs  and  symptoms 
(WESS) were collected per protocol. 
The  PWC,  developed  specifically  to  measure  symptoms  of  benzodiazepine  withdrawal,  rates  20 
common symptoms of withdrawal and was used to determine whether patients experienced withdrawal 
symptoms  after  cessation  of  study  medication.  The  symptoms  measured  are  based  on  those  that  are 
potentially  related  to  benzodiazepine  withdrawal:  gastrointestinal,  mood,  sleep,  motor,  somatic, 
perception and cognition. Patient PWC change scores were calculated by subtracting the patient’s last 
study  visit  PWC  score  (on  full  dose  of  study  medication)  from  the  follow-up  visit  PWC  score.  A 
positive PWC change score was indicative of an increase in withdrawal symptoms following taper of 
study  medication.  The  taper  period  varied  across  studies  from  3  to  7  days,  and  patients  receiving 
pregabalin 200 and 300 mg/day did not taper but stopped their study medication abruptly.  
Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms 
6. 
Overall, DESS events of insomnia, nausea, diarrhoea and headache were reported in small numbers of 
patients  after  discontinuation  of  short  or  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  in  the  GAD  studies. 
However,  in  DPN  Study  040,  none  of  these  events  were  reported  in  the  pregabalin-treated  group. 
These  DESS  are  similar  to  the  discontinuation  symptoms  seen  with  cessation  of  other  CNS  active 
compounds such as anti-depressants. 
In a small sample of healthy volunteers exposed to pregabalin 450 to 600 mg/day for 14 weeks (Study 
072),  anxiety  or  nervousness  were  reported  in  3  subjects  following  abrupt  discontinuation  of 
pregabalin, although the majority of subjects did not experience adverse events upon discontinuation 
of pregabalin. 
The  low  level  of  DESS  events  and  there  being  no  evidence  of  patients  having  difficulty  in 
discontinuing  pregabalin  during  the  protocol  specified  taper  period  of  the  studies  leads  to  the 
conclusion that pregabalin does not appear to produce physiologic dependence beyond what might be 
associated with any unscheduled anxiolytic or antidepressant compound.  
Physician Withdrawal Checklist. 
PWC change scores of 12 to 25 have been observed with benzodiazepines and can be regarded as a 
potentially clinically significant indicator of a withdrawal syndrome. In the short-term adult studies of 
4 to 6 weeks, PWC change scores for  pregabalin-treated patients were generally small (<10 points), 
ranging  from  1.36  to  9.41.  The  PWC  total  score  was  highly  correlated  with  the  HAM-A  score 
(p=0.0001)  prior  to  and  after  medication  discontinuation  in  all  studies,  indicating  that  the  PWC  is 
measuring, in part, symptoms of anxiety. Clinically, a return of anxiety would be anticipated when an 
effective  treatment  is  discontinued  after  short-term  treatment  of  GAD.  Assessment  of  the  PWC

following  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  allows  a  better  comparison  to  withdrawal  seen  after 
long-term benzodiazepine treatment. 
The effect on the PWC following long-term treatment with pregabalin was examined in Study 088, a 
relapse prevention study in which patients received pregabalin for up to 8 months. PWC change scores 
were low following discontinuation of pregabalin treatment in this study (2.05 at follow-up visit 1 and 
1.87 at follow-up visit 2) and were comparable to those in the short-term studies, indicating that long-
term pregabalin treatment does not result in more than mild withdrawal symptoms, just as those seen 
with short-term treatment. The PWC change scores of 12 to 25 seen with discontinuation of long-term 
benzodiazepine treatment are not seen with pregabalin.  
The  MAH  stated  that  pregabalin  does  not  appear  to  produce  physiologic  dependence  beyond  what 
might  be  associated  with  any  unscheduled  anxiolytic  or  antidepressant  compound;  these  have  been 
associated  with  generally  mild  discontinuation  reaction  syndromes.  The  MAH  stated  that  this 
conclusion is supported by the mild effects observed in the rat dependence study, the low incidence of 
discontinuation-emergent adverse events and there being no evidence of patients having difficulty in 
discontinuing pregabalin during the protocol specified taper period of the studies. 
As with all psychotropic medication, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided and this is reflected in 
recommended wording in the proposed SPC to guide the prescriber with an appropriate taper period 
following treatment. 
However  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  this  conclusion.  The  studies  allow  a  direct  comparison  of 
pregabalin with benzodiazepines (lorazepam) and venlafaxine:  
- 
the  short-term  PWC  results  indicate  that  pregabalin  has  more  or  less  the  same  properties 
concerning withdrawal phenomena as the benziodiazephines (lorazepam 6 mg) and venlafaxine 
(75 mg); 
the  long-term  PWC  results  also  indicate  withdrawal  symptoms  comparable  to  the  short-term 
withdrawal symptoms.  
- 
The  withdrawal  phenomena  observed  from 
like 
depersonalistion,  euphoria,  nervousness,  abnormal  thinking  and  amnesia  observed  in  the  short-tem 
studies with pregabalin reflect some CNS-active properties that are also observed with benzodiazpines 
and  other  anxiolytic  agents  such  as  SSRIs  and  SNRIs.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  explain  these 
results more extensively, including the rebound effect (see paragraph 3.3.2.d below).

Psychomotor effects: driving and operating machinery 
7. 
Pregabalin is a CNS active drug associated most commonly with the adverse events of dizziness and 
somnolence. Therefore, individual patients should be advised against driving, operating machinery or 
undertaking potentially hazardous activities until each patient is familiar with how well they tolerate 
pregabalin  treatment.  This  is  reflected  in  the  existing  approved  product  information  for  neuropathic 
pain and epilepsy. 
Three clinical pharmacology studies evaluated safety and the potential pharmacodynamic interaction 
between pregabalin and lorazepam, oxycodone, or ethanol, respectively, in healthy volunteers.  
In addition, the cognitive and psychomotor effects of pregabalin, including the effect on driving ability 
and sleep, were assessed in 24 healthy subjects in Study 097. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  cross-over  study  was  to  assess  the 
effects  of  pregabalin  (450  mg/day),  relative  to  a  standard  benzodiazepine  control  (alprazolam,  3 
mg/day), on cognitive and psychomotor function. Overall this study suggested that pregabalin is safe 
for  use  in  ambulant  patients  performing  the  activities  of  everyday  living,  based  on  the  lack  of 
impairment on BRT (Brake Reaction Time) and lack of effect or mild impairment on other cognitive 
and  psychomotor  parameters.  Although  dizziness  and  somnolence  were  frequently  reported  adverse 
events, these events did not seem to impair significantly the ability to function. Overall, the combined 
psychomotor  and  cognitive  function  profile  of  pregabalin  was  unlike  the  profile  exhibited  by 
alprazolam;  the  psychometric  profile  of  alprazolam  was  as  expected  for  a  benzodiazepine,  and 
therefore alprazolam was an appropriate positive control.

Overdose 
8. 
Data  from  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  indicates  that  the  900  mg/day  dose  was  generally  well 
tolerated  in  healthy  volunteers,  but  that  it  was  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  and  duration  of 
central nervous system adverse events. This finding limited the maximum dose explored in the Phase 
2/3 programme and thus that in the proposed labelling: the maximum recommended daily dose of 
pregabalin is 600 mg/day. 
For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  pregabalin  overdoses  were  categorized  in  2  ways:  1)  overdoses  of 
>600 mg that were reported in the dosing records during the Phase 2/3 trials,  with a focus  on those 
>900 mg/day, and 2) serious adverse events of overdose or  suicide attempt involving pregabalin that 
were not recorded in the dosing records.  
Based on the dosing records, 11 patients (≤0.005%) took pregabalin total daily dosages >600 mg/day 
during the combined controlled and uncontrolled GAD studies .These overdoses ranged from 650 to 
1700 mg/day, with durations of 1 day to a maximum of 87 days. The majority of the adverse events 
reported during overdoses between >600 and 900 mg/day were mild in intensity, comparable to events 
observed  with  the  patients’  regularly  scheduled  doses,  and  without  medically  significant  effects. 
Among  the  2  patients  who  reported  taking  >900  mg/day  (one  of  which  was  reported  as  a  serious 
adverse  event  in  the  open-label  extension  study,  Study  100),  the  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity and the patients recovered. No clinically significant abnormalities in physical examinations, 
vital  signs,  ECG,  or  clinical  laboratory  examinations  were  found  after  a  review  of  all  safety  data 
collected from these patients.  
One additional patient had serious adverse events that involved an overdose of pregabalin that was not 
recorded in the dosing record, with reported overdoses (by the patient or a relative) ranging from 1500 
to 8000 mg. This patient also recovered. 
There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose with pregabalin. Therefore, patients should be 
monitored and receive general supportive measures for at least 30 hours after ingestion of drug (half-
life  approximately  6  hours)  or  while  symptoms  and  signs  persist.  It  should  also  be  noted  that 
pregabalin  is  effectively  removed  from  plasma  by  haemodialysis:  over  a  four  hour  haemodialysis 
treatment, plasma pregabalin concentrations are reduced by approximately 50%. 
This is covered in the current section 4.9 of the approved SPC:  
In overdoses up to 15 g, no unexpected adverse reactions were reported. Treatment of pregabalin 
overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see 
section 4.2 Table 1). 
3.2.d  Conclusion on the original analysis and discussions:  
1.  Withdrawal and rebound symptoms 
The adverse events in the short-term studies are the well-known pregabalin adverse events. However 
symptoms like depersonalisation, euphoria, nervousness, abnormal thinking and amnesia may reflect 
benzodiazepine-like  adverse  events.  Based  on  the  clinical  data  in  the  pivotal  studies  the  MAH  was 
requested by CHMP to discuss these effects and their relation to dependence and/or withdrawal. 
The PWC short-term and long-term results indicate that pregabalin is a compound causing withdrawal 
symptoms after stopping. Historically data presented by the MAH are not relevant as the studies allow 
a direct comparison with benzodiazepines and venlafaxine. The withdrawal phenomena measured on 
the PWC, especially in the 600 mg dosage, seem to be comparable to benzodiazepines (lorazepam). In 
a  single  study  ulitizing  venlafaxine  to  assess  assay  sensitivity,  the  incidence  of  moderate  to  severe 
PWC  symptoms  in  the  pregabalin  600  mg  dosage  group  were  numerically  greater  than  75  mg  of 
venlafaxine  in  11  out  of  20  items,  while  the  converse  was  true  in  the  remaining  nine  items.    No 
statistically  significant  differences  were  noted  between  pregabalin  and  venlafaxine  or  placebo.  A 
pooled analysis of all PWC data was requested by CHMP. 
25/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH was requested to discuss the withdrawal symptoms thoroughly, especially in relation to the 
indication and duration of treatment, along with a detailed description on how this will be managed in 
the risk management plan. 
The MAH responded that data do not support the conclusion that pregabalin has benzodiazepine-like 
properties and that the adverse events observed are common to other CNS-active agents. On the PWC, 
a scale that measures benzodiazepine-like effects, the increase in scores in short-term studies is similar 
for paroxetine, a non-benzodiazepine, and pregabalin (including the pregabalin 600 mg dose group), 
reflecting a return of anxiety. 
The MAH stated that in short-term studies of 4 to 10 weeks, the PWC change scores for pregabalin-
treated patients were generally small (< 5 points). These differences were much lower than the PWC 
change  scores  of  12  to  25  that  are  associated  with  discontinuation  of  long-term  benzodiazepine 
treatment and are consistent with some return of anxiety. 
The  MAH  confirmed  that  there  was  no  increase  in  PWC  change  score  for  long-term  treatment 
compared  with  short-term  treatment,  indicating  that  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  does  not 
result in clinically significant medication discontinuation symptoms. Two studies evaluated the PWC 
in  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin.  Studies  1008-082  and  1008-088  were  relapse  prevention 
studies  (450  mg/day  of  pregabalin  per  patient  for  up  to  8  to  9  months).  Least  squares  mean  PWC 
change scores for pregabalin-treated patients in these studies were low and were comparable to change 
scores  in  the  short-term  studies  (1.36  to  9.41  points).  These  differences  were  much  lower  than  the 
PWC change scores of 12 to 25 that are associated with discontinuation of long-term benzodiazepine 
treatment and are consistent with some return of anxiety. 
The  MAH  agreed  that  adverse  events  do  occur  on  rapid  or  abrupt  discontinuation.  DESS  were 
evaluated  systematically  and  prospectively  in  all  psychiatric  studies  in  the  Lyrica  development 
program but were not collected in any epilepsy studies and were collected but analysed retrospectively 
in  only  one  neuropathic  pain  study.  The  data  from  the  12  short-term  double-blind  controlled 
psychiatric studies is considered the most appropriate for inclusion in Section 4.8 of the SPC. This was 
reflected in the amendments made in the wording of the section 4.8 of the SPC (see section “changes 
to the product information”), as follows: 
After  discontinuation  of  short-term  and  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  withdrawal  symptoms 
have been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: insomnia, headache, 
nausea, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, pain, sweating, and dizziness. The patient 
should be informed about this at the start of the treatment. 
Concerning discontinuation of long-term treatment  of pregabalin there are no data of the incidence 
and severity of withdrawal symptoms in relation to duration of use and dosage of pregabalin. 
The CHMP is in agreement with the above-proposed wording. 
Post Hoc Analysis for Rebound Anxiety 
2. 
The  rebound  anxiety,  a  feature  of  withdrawal  syndromes,  is  an  increase  in  the  severity  of  anxiety 
symptoms  to  levels  greater  than  pre-treatment  after  treatment  is  discontinued,  but  which  lasts  for  a 
short duration that depends on the half-life of the drug. Rebound and relapse appear similar, but are 
differentiated by the severity and duration of symptoms: 
- 
rebound  anxiety  occurs  soon  after  plasma  concentrations  become  subtherapeutic,  and  is 
associated  with  severe  symptoms  beyond  baseline  levels  that  rapidly  return  to  termination 
values.  
relapse, the return of anxiety, would be expected to persist at all follow-up visits.  
- 
Short-term  Study  1008-083  and  long-term  Study  1008-  088  were  assessed  post  hoc  for  rebound 
anxiety, because both studies were designed with 2 follow-up visits, 1 week and 2 weeks after last full 
dose.  Because  of  the  short  half-life  of  pregabalin,  rebound  anxiety  would  be  observed  at  the  first 
follow-up visit as elevated HAM-A score, but the HAM-A scores would return to closer to termination 
26/34

values by the second follow up visit. Rebound anxiety is defined here as HAM-A score greater than or 
equal  to  the  baseline  value  at  the  first  follow-up  visit  with  subsequent  decrease  in  HAM-A  score 
between the first and second follow-up visits. 
Rebound Anxiety Analysis - Short-Term Study 1008-083: The MAH evaluated patients who completed 
the study and who had complete HAM-A data at baseline and at both follow-up visits; in this study 
patients  were  treated  with  placebo,  pregabalin  300,  450,  or  600  mg/day,  or  alprazolam  1.5  mg/day. 
One of 16 patients (6.3%) treated with  placebo, 1 of 18 patients (5.6%) treated with pregabalin 300 
mg/day, and 1 of 18 patients (5.6%) treated with pregabalin 450 mg/day had had a HAM-A total score 
greater than baseline at the first follow-up visit with a drop in their HAMA score between the first and 
second follow-up visits. However, for all 3 patients, the HAM-A total score at follow- up visit 2 did 
not  return  to  termination  visit  values  and  thus  is  not  consistent  with  rebound  anxiety  and  is  more 
consistent with a relapse of anxiety. No patient treated with pregabalin 600 mg/day had a pattern of 
HAM-A  scores consistent  with rebound anxiety; however, these  patients were tapered over a longer 
period, so the follow-up visits may not have been timed properly to assess rebound anxiety. 
Rebound  Anxiety  Analysis  -  Relapse  prevention  Study  1008-088:  The  MAH  evaluated  non-relapsing 
patients  who  received  at  least  3  months  of  treatment  in  the  double-blind  phase  and  had  complete 
HAM-A data at open-label baseline and at both follow-up visits; patients in this study received either 
placebo or pregabalin 450 mg/day. A pattern of HAM-A scores consistent with rebound anxiety was 
not observed in any of the non-relapsers with 3 months or more of exposure to placebo or pregabalin 
450 mg/day. There is no evidence for rebound anxiety in patients receiving long-term treatment. 
3. 
Conclusion on the secondary analyses (rebound and withdrawal symptoms) 
Historical data are used as an argument to demonstrate that there is a difference between pregabalin 
and benzodiazepines in withdrawal symptoms but the CHMP considers that that the results from the 
short-term  studies  submitted  allow  a  direct  comparison  between  pregablin  and  benzodiazepines 
(lorazepam) showing no difference in withdrawal symptoms between pregabalin and lorazepam 6 mg. 
To demonstrate that there is no difference between paroxetine and pregablin in PWC score the MAH 
submitted a study in social phobia that was not in the original file and which is not assessed. Moreover 
it  should  be  stressed  that  the  PWC  is  an  instrument  that  measures  withdrawal  symptoms  (new 
symptoms after stopping). Anxiety is only one of the 34 items on this checklist.  
The CHMP considered that the argument that there was no increase in PWC change score for long-
term  treatment  compared  with  short-term  treatment  was  not  relevant.  The  long-term  placebo-
controlled relapse prevention studies 1008-082 (in patients with Social Phobia) and 1008-088 (in the 
GAD  population)  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  at  both  follow-up  visits  on  the  PWC 
change  (indicating  more  withdrawal  symptoms  in  the  patients  that  stopped  with  pregabalin).  The 
MAH compared these long-term results to historical data arguing that the PWC scores of the patients 
who stopped with pregabalin were low at follow-up but a direct comparison versus benzodiazepines in 
study 1008-082 and 1008-088 has not been investigated.  
To answer the question concerning withdrawal after long-term use versus short-term use, the CHMP 
requested  the  MAH  to  compare  the  PWC  scores  in  the  placebo-group  after  randomization  (after  the 
short-term open label phase) with the PWC scores of the pregabalin group (after long-term treatment). 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  submit  these  data  for  the  studies  1008-082  and  1008-088.  These  data, 
however, cannot provide information about the tapering off; they are only informative about the issue 
of abrupt stopping. 
In  its  response  the  MAH  provided  a  comparison  of  PWC  scores  between  patients  who  discontinued 
pregabalin treatment shortly after randomization and patients who followed longer-term treatment in 
study 1008-088, a comparison of DESS AEs between the first 2 weeks of the double-blind phase and 
the end of the double-blind phase in studies 1008-82 and 1008-88 (as well as the rebound anxiety data 
from short-term study 1008-083 and long-term study 1008-88).

The  submitted  information  suggests  that  long-treatment  with  pregabalin  does  not  increase  the 
incidence and severity of discontinuation symptoms and that there is no evidence of rebound anxiety 
following  pregabalin  treatment.  However,  the  CHMP  does  not  consider  the  information  presented 
conclusive and the issues need to be further investigated. To address this, the MAH was requested by 
the  CHMP  to  make  a  commitment  to  conduct  a  post-authorisation  safety  study  to  investigate 
withdrawal symptoms, which will include an assessment of issues such as dose, duration, and rebound 
anxiety. A proposal for this study will be submitted to the CHMP for discussion in the 2nd quarter of 
2006, as per the Risk Management Plan submitted by the MAH. 
3.2.e  Spontaneous reports 
The following information was available from post-marketing surveillance: 
• 
During  the  period  covered  by  PSUR  1  (07  July  2004  to  06  January  2005),  3  cases  of  drug 
withdrawal syndrome were reported.  
During the period covered by PSUR 2 (07 January 2005 to 31 July 2005), there were 11 cases 
reporting  withdrawal  symptoms.  The  reporter  did not  confirm  the  withdrawal  symptoms  upon 
follow-up for one of the cases. Of the remaining 10 cases, 2 were assessed as serious. In three 
cases  one  week  or  more  was  allowed  for  a  gradual  reduction  in  pregabalin  dose  prior  to 
discontinuation. Abrupt withdrawal with no reduction was noted in four cases. An assessment 
regarding  pregabalin  withdrawal  symptoms  in  one  case  was  confounded  by  amitriptyline 
withdrawal  on  the  same  day.  Symptoms  reported  more  than  once  include  the  following: 
insomnia, diarrhoea, sweating, shivering, depression, and itching. 
A report of pregabalin withdrawal encephalopathy and splenial edema was identified through a 
search of the literature. This case is quite different from the possible signal currently of interest, 
namely withdrawal symptoms similar to those observed with benzodiazepines. 
• 
• 
3.2.f  Suicidality 
Since  the  issue  of  suicidality  is  being  discussed  as  a  general  concern  the  CHMP  requested  the 
company  to  submit  the  data  available  on  this  matter  and  incorporate  amendments  in  the  SPC  if 
appropriate. 
The MAH considers that adverse events relating to suicide attempt occur at a very low frequency with 
pregabalin  treatment,  and  on  the  whole,  are  not  related  to  pregabalin  treatment,  but  to  the  patients 
underlying medical history and therefore no change to the SPC is warranted. The MAH takes adverse 
events relating to attempted suicide very seriously and will continue to actively monitor such events. 
 The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  at  this  moment  no  change  to  the  SPC  is  warranted,  but  the  final 
discussion on this will await the analysis the MAH is doing at present, as previously requested. The 
MAH will continue to actively monitor such events.

5. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION  
Changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) 
- Section 4.1 
The MAH proposed the following text in the section 4.1 (“Therapeutic indication”) of the SPC is: 
LYRICA is indicated for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. 
The above wording is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
- Section 4.2 
In the section 4.2 (“Posology and method of administration”) of the SPC, the MAH proposed the 
following wording: 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two divided doses. 
Pregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150mg per day. Based on individual patient 
response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300mg per day after 1 week. Following an 
additional week the dosage may be increased to 450mg per day. The maximum dosage of 600 mg per 
day may be achieved after an additional week. 
29/34 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In view of the scientific discussions, the CHMP considered that the following underlined amendments 
should be made: 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses.  The need for treatment 
should be reassessed regularly. 
Pregabalin  treatment  can  be  started  with  a  dose  of  150 mg  per  day.    Based  on  individual  patient 
response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after 1 week.  Following an 
additional week the dosage may be increased to 450 mg per day.  The maximum dosage of 600 mg per 
day may be achieved after an additional week. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the above wording is acceptable. 
With regards to the discontinuation of pregabalin, the CHMP considered that the text can be shortened 
as mentioned in the scientific discussion, however the committee was of the opinion that ‘independent 
of  the  indication’  should  be  added  to  avoid  confusion  (as  this  text  does  not  only  apply  for  the 
indication  GAD).  In  addition,  following  QRD-review,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  add  a  cross-
reference  to  section  4.8.  The  MAH  agreed  with  the  CHMP  conclusion  and  amended  the  wording 
accordingly: 
Discontinuation of pregabalin 
In  accordance  with  current  clinical  practice,  if  pregabalin  has  to  be  discontinued  either  in 
neuropathic pain,  epilepsy  or  Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder,  it  is  recommended  this  should  be  done 
gradually over a minimum of 1 week independent of the indication (see section 4.8). 
Concerning  the  paragraph  “Patients  with  renal  impairment”,  the  formula  was  amended  following 
CHMP comments that European clinical-chemical laboratories will express their results of creatinine 
levels in μmol/l and not in mg/dl. 
Concerning the paragraph “Use in children and adolescents”, the CHMP was of the opinion that the 
definitions of age should be stated more clearly in the text, therefore the CHMP requested that the age 
limit of adolescents (12 – 17 years of age) be mentioned as follows: 
Use in children and adolescents  (12 to 17 years of age)
Lyrica  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  below  the  age  of  12  years  and  adolescents  (12  -  17 
years of age) due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.3). 
The  safety  and  effectiveness  of  pregabalin  in  paediatric  patients  below  the  age  of  12  years  and 
adolescents has not been established. 
The use in children is not recommended (see section 5.3)
The  MAH  was  in  agreement  with  the  change  suggested  by  the  CHMP  and  amended  the  wording 
accordingly.  
- Section 4.4 
The  statement  concerning  lactose  was  moved  to  the  end  of  section  4.4  as  requested  by  the  CHMP. 
Furthermore, the CHMP was of the opinion that the 2 following clarifications should be made into this 
section:  
- 
after  discontinuation  of  short-term  and  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  withdrawal 
symptoms  have  been  shown.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  patients  populations  should  be 
informed about this at the start of the treatment and this should be reflected in the SPC. 
In  addition  concerning  the  discontinuation  of  long-term  treatment  of  pregabalin  there  are  no 
data  of  the  incidence  and  severity  of  withdrawal  symptoms  in  relation  to  duration  of  use  and 
dosage of pregabalin. The CHMP is of the opinion that this should be reflected accordingly.

Following discussion with the MAH, the CHMP agreed that the anxiety term could be removed based 
on  the  fact  that  it  occurs  at  in  incidence  lower  than  placebo.  Therefore  the  following  wording  was 
proposed by the CHMP (changes underlined) and then agreed by the MAH: 
“……After  discontinuation  of  short-term  and  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  withdrawal 
symptoms have been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: insomnia, 
headache,  nausea,  diarrhoea,  flu  syndrome,  nervousness,  depression,  pain,  sweating  and  dizziness. 
The patient should be informed about this at the start of the treatment.  
Concerning discontinuation of long-term treatment  of pregabalin there are no data of the incidence 
and severity of withdrawal symptoms in relation to duration of use and dosage of pregabalin. 
Patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of  galactose  intolerance,  the  Lapp  lactase  deficiency  or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. ” 
- Section 4.6  
The following wording was suggested by the MAH: 
Therefore,  Lyrica  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  the  benefit  to  the  mother  clearly 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus 
Lyrica should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (for example if the benefit to the 
mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the underlined section should be added and the crossed-out 
wording  ‘For example’ should be removed, leading to the following wording: 
“…..Lyrica should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother 
clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).” 
The MAH agreed with the comment from CHMP and amended the wording accordignly. 
- Section 4.7 
In  view  of  the  scientific  discussion  with  regards  to  the  Psychomotor  effects:  driving  and  operating 
machinery,  the  following  amendment  in  the  section  4.7  of  the  SPC  was  proposed  by  the  MAH  and 
adopted by the CHMP:  
Lyrica  may  cause  dizziness  and  somnolence  and  therefore  may  influence  the  ability  to  drive  or  use 
machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially 
hazardous  activities  until  it  is  known  whether  this  medication  affects  their  ability  to  perform  these 
activities. 
- Section 4.8 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the order of the undesirable effects within each frequency should 
be modified in order to take into account the decreasing seriousness of the adverse events. 
In  addition,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  undesirable  effect  “Amnesia”  to  be  added  as  a  common 
ADR under the Nervous system disorders. In the original application the term “amnesia” was included 
within “memory impairment” and the summation of the two frequencies led to “memory impairment” 
being described as a common adverse event. This was originally proposed by the MAH to simplify the 
use of the table. In the view of the CHMP request, the MAH proposed to split the two terms to comply 
with  the  request.  However,  to  follow  the  frequency  convention,  the  MAH  proposed  that  the 
term“memory impairment” remains in “common” adverse event but “amnesia” (with an incidence of 
0.6%) would be classed as an “uncommon” adverse event.

The  proposed  revised  section  of  the  table  in  section  4.8  for  under  the  Nervous  system  disorders  is 
shown below: 
Nervous system disorders  
Very Common 
Common 
Uncommon 
Dizziness, somnolence 
Ataxia, disturbance in attention, coordination abnormal, memory 
impairment, tremor, dysarthria, memory impairment, disturbance in 
attention, paraesthesia 
Syncope, stupor, myoclonus, psychomotor hyperactivity, cognitive 
disorder, visual field defect, ageusia, dyskinesia, dizziness postural, 
intention tremor, nystagmus, hypoaesthesia, visual field defect, 
nystagmus, cognitive disorder, speech disorder, myoclonus, 
hyporeflexia, dyskinesia, hypoaesthesia, amnesia, psychomotor 
hyperactivity, dizziness postural, hyperaesthesia, ageusia, burning 
sensation, intention tremor, stupor, syncope.
In addition, the CHMP requested to change the withdrawal section beneath the adverse event table in 
the section 4.8 to reflect the wording adopted in the section 4.4. Furthermore, an adapted proposal for 
section  4.8    (as  for  section  4.4  mentioned  above)  of  the  SPC  concerning  discontinuation  was  also 
submitted by the MAH. The proposed text is as follows: 
After  discontinuation  of  short-term  and  long-term  treatment  with  pregabalin  withdrawal  symptoms 
have been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: insomnia, headache, 
nausea, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, pain, sweating, and dizziness. The patient 
should be informed about this at the start of the treatment. 
Concerning discontinuation of long-term treatment  of pregabalin there are no data of the incidence 
and severity of withdrawal symptoms in relation to duration of use and dosage of pregabalin. 
The CHMP is in agreement with the above-proposed wording. 
- Section 5.1 
The following text was proposed by the MAH:  
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
Pregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled studies of 4-6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 week 
duration and a long-term relapse prevention study of 8 months duration. 
Relief  of  the  symptoms  of  GAD  as  reflected  by  the  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  was 
observed by Week 1. Pregabalin has also been shown to significantly reduce scores on both the HAM-
A Psychic and Somatic subscales. 
In controlled clinical trials (4-8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% of the 
patients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline to endpoint. 
Based  on  the  scientific  discussion,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  above  wording  should  be 
amended as follows: 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
Pregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled studies of 4-6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 week 
duration and a long-term relapse prevention study of 8 months duration with a double blind relapse 
prevention phase of 6 months duration. 
Relief  of  the  symptoms  of  GAD  as  reflected  by  the  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  was 
observed by Week 1.  Pregabalin has also been shown to significantly reduce scores on both the 
HAM-A Psychic and Somatic subscales.
In controlled clinical trials (4-8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% of the 
patients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline to endpoint.

- Other changes to the SPC 
Other QRD and minor changes were introduced in some sections of the SPC, with the agreement of 
the CHMP. 
Changes to the Package Leaflet (PL) 
The  PL  was  amended  in  accordance  with  the  changes  made  in  the  SPC;  any  comments  mentioned 
above for the SPC applicable for the PL were taken into account and the PL was amended accordingly. 
The  CHMP  is  in  agreement  with  the  following  wording  in  the  sections  of  the  PL  mentioned  below 
(underlined additions and deletion highlighted): 
- Section 1 - WHAT LYRICA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder:  LYRICA  is  used  to  treat  Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder  (GAD).    The 
symptoms of GAD are prolonged excessive anxiety and worry that are difficult to control. GAD can 
also  cause  restlessness  or  feeling  keyed  up  or  on  edge,  being  easily  fatigued,  having  difficulty 
concentrating or mind going blank, feeling irritable, having muscle tension or sleep disturbance.  This 
is different to the stresses and strains of everyday life. 
Section 3 - HOW TO TAKE LYRICA 
Always take LYRICA exactly as your doctor has instructed you. You should check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not unsure. 
Your doctor will determine what dose is appropriate for you. 
Peripheral neuropathic pain, epilepsy or Generalised Anxiety Disorder: Take the number of capsules 
as instructed by your doctor. 
If you forget to take LYRICA 
It is important to take your LYRICA capsules regularly at the same time each day.  If you forget to 
take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for your next dose.  In that case, just 
carry on with the next dose as normal.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.Do 
not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for the one you missed.
Amendments to the wording in the sections 1,2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were suggested by the CHMP, to comply 
with the current version of the QRD template. The CHMP was in agreement with the related wording 
proposed by the MAH. 
“User Consultation” of the package leaflet 
According  to  the  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  the  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  the  CHMP 
requested  the  MAH  to  provide  results  of  assessments  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  target  patient 
groups  on  the  package  leaflet  (‘user  consultation’)  or  a  justification  for  not  performing  such 
consultation. 
The MAH provided a justification for not performing a Readability test at this time. The MAH stated 
that  the  changes  to  the  PIL  due  to  the  proposed  addition  of  Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder  do  not 
significantly change the readability. The CHMP considers this justification acceptable. 
Changes to the Labelling 
The labelling was changed in line with the current version of the QRD template. The MAH proposed 
changes, which were acceptable to the CHMP.

Overall conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment  
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  variation 
application  EMEA/H/C/546/II/04  for  Lyrica  (pregabalin),  to  include  treatment  of  General  Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD) is approvable. The safety profile of Lyrica for GAD is similar to the observed in the 
previously  approved  indications.  However,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  withdrawal  symptoms 
need to be monitored. The RMP includes a commitment to conduct a post-authorisation safety study to 
investigate withdrawal symptoms that will include an assessment of issues such as dose, duration, and 
rebound anxiety; a proposal for the post-authorisation study will be submitted for discussion in the 2nd 
quarter of 2006.  
CONCLUSION 
On 26 January 2006 the CHMP considered this type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and 
Package Leaflet based on the observations and appropriate conclusions. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measure as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report):

be beneficial for patients co-treated with drugs known to 
available evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing 
experience and literature and to present ADRs in 
compliance with the SmPC guideline. Update of 
section 4.4 of the SmPC to include therapeutic dose 
monitoring for the addition or removal of an 
interacting medication based on an expert 
consensus. Update of section 4.7 of the SmPC to 
include a statement on the moderate influence on 
the ability to drive. Update of section 5.2 of the 
SmPC based on current literature on the 
pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
throughout the PI and to bring the PI in line with the 
latest QRD template version 10.1. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and PL 
interfere with MPA in improving therapeutic outcome.  
The SmPC section 4.7 has been updated to include a 
statement on a moderate influence on the ability to drive 
based on the ADRs of somnolence, confusion, dizziness, 
tremor and hypertension which have been reported at a 
high frequency.  
The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated to replace all 
specific infections under the umbrella terms bacterial, 
fungal and viral infections, to include neoplasm, 
pseudolymphoma, ecchymosis, venous thrombosis, mouth 
ulceration, abdominal distension, haematuria, hernia 
protozoal infections, lymphoma, lymphoproliferative 
disorder, aplasia pure red cell, bone marrow failure, 
lymphocele, gingival hyperplasia as ADR and to replace 
anorexia by decreased appetite, myasthenic syndrome by 
muscular weakness, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer by 
gastrointestinal ulcer. PTs previously under SOC 
investigations are now included under the SOC Renal and 
urinary disorders (PTs of blood creatinine increased and 
blood urea increased), under the SOC Hepatobiliary 
disorders (PTs of hepatic enzyme increased, blood lactate 
dehydrogenase increased and blood alkaline phosphatase 
increased) and under the SOC Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (PT of weight decreased).

The SmPC section 4.4 on interactions has been updated to 
the information on concomitant use of tacrolimus 
with CellCept and to provide recommendations on 
therapeutic drug monitoring for management of 
transplant patients, based on reviews of the medical 
literature and clinical treatment guidelines. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to correct inconsistencies in the 
Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
state that therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be 
appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from 
ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or to ensure 
adequate immunosuppression in patients with high 
immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, treatment with 
antibiotics).

Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria 
pharmaceutical forms, in order to update information 
regarding potential interactions with antibiotics and 
other drugs interfering with glucuronidation pathway, 
based on a review of published literature. The 
package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, 
update of section 6.6 of the SmPC and section 3 of 
the package leaflet to improve the recommendations 
regarding safe handling of the powder for oral 
in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, 
fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may 
interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of phenolic 
glucuronide of mycophenolic acid (MPAG) /mycophenolic 
acid (MPA) and should therefore be used with caution due 
to their potential to reduce systemic MPA exposure and 
thus reduce the efficacy of CellCept. Drugs inhibiting 
glucuronidation of MPA may increase MPA exposure and

without Ph. Eur. certificate - new manufacturer 
date in patients treated with CellCept. In 16 of the reported 
cases, dose reduction (in 4 cases) or discontinuation (in 12 
cases) of CellCept led to resolution of the condition. A 
causal association between CellCept and PRCA could not be 
excluded.  
The review of the isolated cases of acquired Pelger-Huet 
anomaly and abnormal neutrophil morphology reported in 
patients treated with CellCept shows that a causal 
association between abnormal neutrophil morphological 
abnormalities, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly 
and CellCept can not be excluded. 
The assessment of the pharmacokinetic data shows an 
interaction between CellCept and ciprofloxacin or 
amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid which can lead to a 
reduction in pre-dose concentration of mycophenolic acid of 
about 50% compared to baseline pre-antibiotic 
concentrations. Gum hyperplasia, swelling or gingival 
hyperplasia are expected adverse drug reactions for 
CellCept. "Gingival hyperplasia" is listed in the Company 
Core Data Sheet of the MAH.  
The CellCept's product information has been updated 
accordingly.

the summary of product characteristics (SPC) to 
implement the warning on BK virus-associated 
nephropathy (BKVN) and JC virus associated 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
requested by the CHMP in July 2008. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to include 
information on the excipient sorbitol in the SPC and 
package leaflet (PL) of the powder for oral 
suspension formulation, to comply with the EU 
guideline on "Excipients in the label and package 
leaflet on medicinal products for human use".

mycophenolate mofetil with ciclosporin and steroids. 
Although the risk of BKVN may be related to the total 
burden of immunosuppression, an association specifically 
with MMF is biologically plausible and cannot be ruled out. 
It is therefore considered important to make physicians 
fully aware of the risks of opportunistic infections that may 
occur under potent immunosuppression. Thus physicians 
should consider BKVN and PML in the differential diagnosis 
in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal 
function and neurological symptoms.

on pregnancy the CHMP noted that among the 191 
pregnancy cases received by the MAH since CellCept has 
been first marketed, 38 cases had been reported as 
spontaneous abortion. Thus, the CHMP concluded that 
spontaneous abortion should be included in section 4.6 of 
the SPC.

Leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have 
been reported in CellCept treated patients and that 
physicians should consider PML in the differential 
diagnosis in patients reporting neurological 
symptoms. The PL was updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
took the opportunity to amend the storage condition

the wording in the PL.

treated patients based on a safety review of all PML cases 
reported with mycophenolate mofetil in the company safety 
database. In the reported cases patients generally had risk 
factors for PML, including immunosuppressant therapies 
and impairment of immune function. Nevertheless based on 
the temporal relationship observed in some cases, the 
contributory role of CellCept cannot be excluded. Thus, in 
immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider 
PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting 
neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist 
should be considered as clinically indicated. Furthermore, in 
patients who develop PML, physicians should consider the 
reduction of the total immunosuppression. In transplant 
patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place 
the graft at risk.

updated to include that congenital malformations (including 
ear malformations, i.e. abnormally formed or absent 
external/middle ear) were reported in children of patients 
exposed to CellCept, in combination with other 
immunosuppressants, during pregnancy. Section 4.8 of the 
SPC was updated to include a cross-reference to section 
4.6 for congenital disorders. Finally, section 2 of the PL was 
updated in order to reflect the changes in the SPC and to 
re-inforce the message that CellCept should not be used 
during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by doctors.

medicinal products: 
- tacrolimus: in hepatic transplant patients, the exposure of 
MPA (mycophenolic acid), which is the active metabolite of 
CellCept, was not significantly affected by the 
coadministration of tacrolimus; 
- ciclosporin A: if concomitant ciclosporin treatment is 
stopped, an increase in the concentration of MPA should be 
expected; 
- sirolimus: in renal transplant patients, concomitant 
administration of CellCept and ciclosporin A resulted in 
reduced MPA exposures by 30 50% compared with patients 
receiving the combination of sirolimus and similar doses of 
CellCept; 
- norfloxacin and metronidazole: in healthy volunteers, no 
Page 32/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant interaction was observed when CellCept was 
administered with - norfloxacin and metronidazole 
separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole 
combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30 
% following a single dose of CellCept; 
- rifampicin: in patients not also taking ciclosporin, 
concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin 
resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure; 
 - sevelamer: decrease in MPA exposure was observed 
when CellCept was concomitantly administered with 
sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft 
rejection). 
The PL has been updated accordingly. 
Additionally, the MAH took the opportunity to reword 
section 4.9 "Overdose" of the SPC in order to include 
information on signs and symptoms of overdose and on 
treatment of overdose.

of a detailed examination of the cases  reported by the 
MAH,   it is reasonable to conclude that aplastic anaemia 
and bone marrow depression are potential adverse drug 
reactions attributable to Cellcept. Therefore the MAH has 
amended the list of undesirable effects from post-
marketing experience in the SPC to include  that there have 
been isolated reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow 
depression in patients treated with CellCept, some of which 
have been fatal.

angioedema of approximately 3:100,000 (i.e. <1:10,000 -

Anaphylaxis:  A total of 19 case reports were retrieved. No 
rate estimates were possible but the figures suggest a rate 
that is likely to be less that the estimated incidence of 
angioedema. 
Allergic reaction: The Meddra-preferred term 
"hypersensitivity" has been proposed by the MAH instead of 
"allergic reaction" in section 4.8. For consistency section 
4.3 was also amended.

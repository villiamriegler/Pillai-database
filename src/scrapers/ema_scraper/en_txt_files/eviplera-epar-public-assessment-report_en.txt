Table 2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Infection  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  and  the  resulting  Acquired  Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) are having a significant human and socio-economic impact.  
Introduction  of  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)  has  led  to  a  dramatic  reduction  in  mortality 
and morbidity in treated HIV-infected individuals. Further improvements in therapy and outcome have 
been  challenged  by  limitations  of  the  commercially  available  antiretroviral  (ARV)  agents,  including 
safety  and  tolerability,  dosing  complexity,  and  the  emergence  of  viral  resistance  resulting  in  reduced 
ARV activity. 
Current  treatment  guidelines  recommend  a  combination  of  2  nucleoside/tide  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitor  (N(t)RTIs)  plus  a  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NNRTI)  or  a  protease 
inhibitor (PI) for first line therapy in HIV infected individuals. Treatment guidelines list FTC and TDF as 
a preferred NRTI/NtRTI backbone in an antiretroviral regimen for initial therapy. 
Improved tolerability, safety, and simple dosing regimens are important drivers of good adherence and 
hence  lessen  risk  of  development  of  drug  resistance  and  should,  therefore,  be  considered  as  major 
elements  in  the  development  of  new  potent  ARV  compounds,  especially  for  the  ARV  treatment-naïve 
population. 
In  recent  years,  new  antiretroviral  therapies  have  been  approved  with  improved  safety  profiles  and 
convenient dosing regimens. To achieve successful long-term treatment, maximizing viral suppression 
and  prevention  of  drug  resistance  have  become  the  primary  goals.  Adherence  is  known  to  be 
paramount in maintaining viral suppression, as missing doses can result in viral rebound and increased 
risk of resistance development. Among regimens of comparable efficacy, both physicians and 
HIV-1  infected  patients  receiving  antiretroviral  therapy  rate  total  pill  burden,  dosing  frequency,  and 
safety  concerns  among  the  greatest  obstacles  to  achieving  adherence.  Thus,  there  continues  to  be  a 
need  for  new  treatments  that  combine  potent  and  sustained  efficacy  with  acceptable  tolerability  and 
minimal long-term toxicity, as well as practical and convenient dosing. 
NNRTIs play an important role and are widely used in the treatment of HIV infection, most commonly 
in first line therapy. The currently approved NNRTIs in Europe for use in treatment-naïve adult patients 
are  nevirapine  (NVP),  and  efavirenz  (EFV).  These  NNRTIs  can  be  associated  with  safety/tolerability 
problems (mainly hepatotoxicity, central nervous system symptoms, and/or rash). Currently one novel 
NNRTI,  etravirine  (ETR), is  approved  for  use in HIV-1 infected,  treatment-experienced  adult  patients, 
including those with NNRTI resistance. 
Rilpivirine has been coformulated with the standard-of-care NRTI backbone FTC/TDF into an FDC tablet 
to be administered once daily with a meal. This FDC represents a significant benefit to HIV-1 infected 
patients  due  to  simplified  dosing.  The  FDC  of  FTC/RPV/TDF  has  the  potential  to  combine  a  next 
generation  NNRTI,  having  an  improved  safety  profile  compared  to  EFV,  with  the  standard-of-care, 
preferred-agent  NRTIs  FTC  and  TDF.  This  fixed-dose  regimen  would  potentially  be  the  second  highly 
active,  once  daily  FDC  regimen,  and  will  address  limitations  with  the  only  other  fixed-dose  regimen 
EFV/FTC/TDF (Atripla). The combination tablet of FTC/RPV/TDF offers an attractive treatment option to 
a  significant  number  of  patients  who  wish  to  avoid  using  EFV  due  to  concerns  about  tolerability 
(including  central  nervous  system  adverse  reactions)  and  its  potential  for  teratogenicity.  Of  note, 
Atripla  is  not  approved  for  use  in  treatment-naïve  patients  but  is  indicated  in  adults  with  virologic 
Eviplera

suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy 
for more than three months. However, when used separately, the 3 active agents (EFV, TDF and FTC) 
are considered one of the standard first line regimens in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients and as 
such they are approved. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The  Rilpivirine  /  Emtricitabine  /  Tenofovir  Disoproxil  Fumarate  (RPV/FTC/TDF)  fixed-dose  combination 
tablet represents a new complete regimen for administration as a single tablet, to be taken once daily 
with  a  meal,  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  HIV-1  infection.  Rilpivirine  (TMC278)  is  a  novel  NNRTI 
with in vitro activity against wild-type HIV-1 and NNRTI-resistant mutants. It has been developed for 
treatment  of  ARV  naïve  HIV-1  infected  individuals  with  the  aim  to  have  a  better  safety/tolerability 
profile compared to other NNRTIs.  
There are currently no data available from clinical studies with RPV/FTC/TDF in treatment-experienced 
or  in  heavily  pretreated  patients;  and  there  are  no  data  available  to  support  the  combination  of 
RPV/FTC/TDF and other antiretroviral agents. 
At the time of submission RPV/FTC/TDF was not registered in any country in the world. 
The applicant applied for the indication: Eviplera is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine 
hydrochloride  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate.  It  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over. The recommended dose 
one tablet, once daily (q.d.), taken orally with a meal. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

and process validation of the active substance has been supplied in the form of an active substance 
master file (ASMF). The manufacturing process consists of five steps. 
Rilpivirine  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR),  identification  of  chloride  (Ph 
Eur), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content, particle size, sulphated ash, 
and heavy metals. 
Batch  analysis  data  of  10  batches  of  active  substance  are  provided.  The  tests  and  limits  in  the 
specifications are considered appropriate for controlling the quality of this active substance. 
Stability data are presented for three batches of rilpivirine hydrochloride, stored for 36 months at 5°C, 
25 °C / 60% RH, 30°C/ 65% RH and 30°C/ 75% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH. A photostability 
study and a force degradation study were also performed according with ICH guidelines The packaging 
used in stability trials is identical to that proposed for storage and distribution. 
The test parameters evaluated in these studies were appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water 
content, particle size, microbiological purity, identification of polymorph. The testing was performed in 
accordance with the tests in the specifications for the drug substance. In the stability studies additional 
tests for microbiological purity and polymorphism are also included. 
The active substance remained unchanged at all time points and under all conditions tested. No trends 
have been observed for any test parameter under any conditions. The results justify the retest period 
proposed.  
Emtricitabine 
Emtricitabine is already approved for centralized products Emtriva (EU/1/03/261/001-003) and more 
recently for the fixed dose combination tablet products Truvada (EU/1/04/305/001-002) and Atripla 
(EU/1/07/430/001-002). It has been confirmed that the submitted active substance information for 
emtricitabine is identical to the currently approved information for the EU approved products Emtriva 
and Truvada and Atripla. 
Emtricitabine which has the chemical name is 4-Amino-5-Fluoro-1-(2R-hydroxymethyl-[1,3]- 
Oxathiolan-5S-yl)-(1H)-Pyrimidin-2-one is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic. The chemical 
structure is: 
Figure 2. 
Emtricitabine possesses two chiral centers. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist;. The 
synthetic route has been chosen to be stereo-selective for the formation of the desired cis-(-) 
enantiomer, emtricitabine. Emtricitabine is produced in a single polymorphic form. However, three 
polymorphs of emtricitabine have been observed. Form I, is consistently produced.

The manufacturing process consists of 2 steps. Adequate In-Process Controls are applied during the 
manufacture of the active substance. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting materials and reagents, have been presented and are satisfactory. 
Emtricitabine  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR,  HPLC),  clarity  of  solution, 
water  content,  enantiomeric  purity,  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  residue 
on ignition (Ph Eur), organic volatile impurities (GC), and particle size. 
The  specifications  for  emtricitabine  have  been  justified  and  are  based  on  results  of  emtricitabine 
batches used in formulation, stability, non-clinical toxicological and clinical studies.  The specifications 
are  the  same  as  those  already  approved  for  use  in  previously  approved  products  Truvada  and  are 
considered toxicologicaly qualified. 
Stability data for production 18 batches stored in a package representative of the commercial package 
and were manufactured using synthetic processes that are representative of commercial active 
substance manufacture. The batches were stored 36 months at 25C/60% RH, 12 months at 30C/65% 
RH and 6 months at 40C/75% RH. A photo-stability study was carried in 1 batch and confirmed that 
emtricitabine is not susceptible to degradation under the influence of light. The following parameters 
are tested during the stability studies: Appearance, purity, impurities/degradation products, water 
content and enantiomeric purity. No significant changes were observed. Based on the presented 
stability data the proposed re-test period is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is already approved for centralized products Viread (EU/1/01/200/001-
002) and more recently for the fixed dose combination tablet products Truvada (EU/1/04/305/001-
002) and Atripla (EU/1/07/430/001-002). It has been confirmed that the submitted active substance 
information for tenofovir is identical to the currently approved information for the EU approved 
products Viread, Truvada and Atripla. 
Tenofovir which has the chemical name is (R)-5-[[2-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-1-methylethoxy]methyl]-

forms of have been observed 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 steps. Adequate In-Process Controls are applied during the 
manufacture of the active substance. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting materials and reagents, have been presented and are satisfactory. 
Tenofovir specifications include tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), identification of fumaric 
acid,  clarity of  solution, water  content,  enantiomeric  purity,  assay  (HPLC), impurities  (HPLC),  fumaric 
acid  content,  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  organic  volatile  impurities  (GC),  particle  size,  and  differential 
scanning calorimetry. 
The  specifications  for  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  are  the  same  as  those  approved  for  use  in  the 
manufacture of previously approved products .  The specifications are considered justified based on the 
results of clinical, non-clinical, stability and commercial batches. The limits for drug related impurities

Tenofovir  disproxil  fumarate  has  been  subjected  to  long  term  (5C)  and  accelerated  (25C/60% RH) 
storage  conditions  according  to  ICH  guidelines.  The  active  substance  was  packaged  in  sealed 
polyethylene  bags  and  placed  in  tightly  closed  HDPE  bottles.  Data  up  to  36 months  long  term  have 
been  provided  for  three  batches  from  each  of  the  three  manufacturers..  For  six  of  the  batches, 
6 months  accelerated  data  have  been  submitted.  The  batches  are  tested  for  appearance,  purity, 
impurity  and  degradation  product  content,  and  water  content  at  each  scheduled  time  point.  In 
addition, enantiomeric purity and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is determined annually (after 
six  months  at  the  accelerated  condition).  Photostability  according  to  ICH  Q1B  hwas  also  been  carried 
out. No significant changes were observed. Based on the presented stability data the proposed re-test 
period is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The development of the product has been adequately performed and described, the choice of 
excipients justified and their functions explained. Goal of development was an immediate release, solid 
oral dosage form, bioequivalent with the single-agent products, with no interactions between the three 
active substances, and a robust manufacturing process. Granulation processes of the single-agent 
products were adopted and based on Bioequivalence studies the proposed tablet formulation was 
chosen out of four developed formulations. The wet-granulation manufacturing process was 
successfully transferred from the development to the commercial manufacturing scale on the same site. 
The pharmaceutical development of the product was adequately performed. 
Excipients are used at unexceptional concentrations and have been shown to be compatible with the 
active substances.  
The excipients used are microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), lactose monohydrate (diluent), povidone 
(binder), pregelatinised starch (binder), polysorbate 20 (surfactant), croscarmellose sodium 
(disintegrant), magnesium stearate (lubricant) and Opadry II Purple (film coat). The selection and 
function of the excipients has been described. All excipies used in the manufacture of the finished 
product meet the requirements of Ph Eur except for the film-coating material which is tested according 
to an in-house specification. 
The container closure system comprises a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a 
polypropylene (PP) continuous thread child-resistant cap lined with aluminium foil. The package 
contains a silica gel dessicant (in a sachet or canister) and a polyester fibre coil.   
The HDPE bottles and PP closures comply with EU requirements for plastic containers and olefins. They 
also comply with Directive 2002/72/EC and Ph Eur requirements. All container closure components 
must pass appearance, dimension, identification, and certificate of conformance requirements.  
Adventitious agents 
As regards excipients of human or animal origin, the following applies. The lactose monohydrate is 
sourced from from cow’s milk that is fit for human consumption. A letter of confirmation in respect of 
this from the supplier has been submitted. The magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin which also 
has been confirmed by supplier statement. All other excipients, (including the Opadry film coat for 
which a supplier statement also has been enclosed) are of vegetable, synthetic or mineral origin.  
Manufacture of the product 
The proposed manufacturing process for the finished product involves standard technology using 
standard manufacturing processes such as wet granulation, dry granulation, milling, blending, 
compressing and film-coating.. Standard manufacturing equipment is used.  
The manufacturing process including intermediate products and critical steps have been adequately 
validated. by a number of studies for the major steps of the manufacturing process and is satisfactory. 
The in process controls are adequate for this tablet preparation.

The batch analysis data on three consecutive batches show that the tablets can be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specifications., which is suitable for control of 
this oral preparation. 
Product specification 
The  product  specifications  include  tests  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identification  of  the 
active substances (HPLC or UPLC), water content, uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution, assay 
of the active substances (HPLC or UPLC), degradation products (HPLC or UPLC). 
Degradation  products  are  controlled  and  their  limits  are  justified  by  reference  to  stability  studies  and 
toxicology studies. 
The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality 
of the finished product for their intended purpose. 
Batch analysis data confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  on  the  product  was  provided  for  three  pilot-scale  batches  stored  during  12  months  at 
25°C/60%  RH  and  30°C/75%  RH,  and  during  6  months  at  40°C/75%  RH,  together  with  results  of 
photo stability- and stress tests, and with supportive stability results of Truvada tablets (48 months at 
25°C/60%  RH,  12  month  at  30  °C/75%  RH,  and  6  months  at  40°C/75%  RH)  and  of  three  full-scale 
batches of rilpivirine 25 mg tablets (24 months at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH, and 6 months at 
40°C/75% RH). The parameters tested in the stability studies comprise appearance, strength (assay), 
degradation products, dissolution and water content.  
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SPC 
are  acceptable,  and  it  is  concluded  that  the  tablets  need  to  be  stored  in  the  original  packaging  to 
protect from moisture. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non clinical studies have been performed for all three individual agents, and for the combination of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are well known active substances. These 
products and their combination are already approved for some time. A summary of the data are 
provided. Data for rilpivirine are identical to data for rilpivirine 25 mg single component that was 
evaluated in parallel of this fixed dose combination. The studies with rilpivirine are presented in more 
detail.  
No toxicity studies on the triple combination (Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir) have been performed 
in line with a centralised scientific advice procedure in 2007. The CHMP endorses that no toxicity 
studies on the triple combination is needed.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is intracellular phosphorylated to its 5’-
triphosphate.  Rilpivirine  is  a  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor.  It  binds  to  reverse 
transcriptase separately from the polymerase active site, inhibiting reverse transcriptase allosterically. 
Tenofovir  is  a  nucleotide  analogue  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor.  It  is  intracellular  converted  to 
tenofovir diphosphate.  
No effect of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir on human DNA polymerases is expected, because of 
a much lower (35- up to 3000-fold) Ki value for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase compared to human DNA 
polymerases, and because rilpivirine had no effect on human DNA synthesis up to 1000 µM.  
For  emtricitabine,  EC50  against  HIV-1  was  0.0013  –  0.5  µM  and  against  HIV-2  0.08  –  1.5  µM. 
Emtricitabine showed similar activity against different HIV-1 subtypes. EC50 for rilpivirine against HIV-
1 group M was 0.07 – 1 nM. Against group O, EC50 was 2.88 – 8.45 nM. EC90 against HIV-1 was 1.12 
– 1.79 nM (0.41 – 0.66 ng/mL). 
Rilpivirine demonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to 
10,830  nM  (920  to  3,970  ng/ml.  A  reduction  in  antiviral  activity  was  observed  in  the  presence  of 
human  serum  proteins.  The  protein  binding  correction  factor  for  rilpivirine  was  experimentally 
determined to be 39.2 in the presence of 45 mg/mL human serum albumin. This corresponds to a high 
protein  binding  of  rilpivirine.  EC50  for  tenofovir  against  HIV-1  was  0.04  –  6  µM.  The  activity  was 
similar against the HIV-1 subtypes. The potency of tenofovir against HIV-2 was also similar. 
In  passage  experiments,  emtricitabine  induced  rapid  emergence  of  resistance,  with  as  first  and  most 
common  mutation  M184V/I.  Apart  from  inducing  reduced  susceptibility  of  the  virus  to  the  drug, 
M184V/I mutations cause a reduction in replication capacity of the virus, an effect which is increased 
by  the  presence  of  the  K65R  mutation,  which  is  induced  by  tenofovir.  In  fixed-dose  selection 
experiments at high MOI, the concentration of rilpivirine to prevent viral replication was lower (40 nM) 
than  that  of  efavirenz,  etravirine  and  nevirapine  (at  least  200  nM).  Experiments  in  wild-type  and 
NNRTI  resistant  strains  showed  that  the  in  vitro  resistance  profile  of  rilpivirine  may  include  the 
mutations  V90I,  L100I,  K101E,  V106A/I,  V108I,  E138G/K/Q/R,  V179F/I,  Y181C/I,  V189I,  G190E, 
H221Y,  F227C,  and  M230I/L.  It  was  shown  crystallographically  that  rilpivirine  is  capable  of 
conformational changes to mutations in the reverse transcriptase, thus providing protection to at least 
some of the potential mutations. Among a large amount of recombinant clinical isolates resistant to at 
least 1 first generation NNRTI, 62% remained susceptible to rilpivirine, which was similar to etravirine 
(62%)  and  better  than  efavirenz  (11.3%)  and  nevirapine  (4.6%).  Experiments  with  site-directed 
mutants  showed  that  M184V/I  did  not  induce  resistance  to  rilpivirine.  The  K65R  mutation  causes 
reduced  susceptibility  to  tenofovir,  which  is  attenuated  by  the  M184V/I  mutations.  This  resensitizing 
effect  of  M184V/I  is  also  observed  for  other  mutations  including  L74V/I  and  thymidine-analog 
associated mutations. Viruses with insertion mutations between positions 67 and 70 were resistant to 
tenofovir. Also here, attenuation of this resistance was observed when combined with M184V. Among 
1000 clinical isolates (treatment-naïve), 97.5% were susceptible to tenofovir. 
In vitro resistance selection experiments with the combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir 
revealed  no  resistance  mutations  to  rilpivirine.  The  emtricitabine  mutation  M184I  was  observed  at  a 
later point in time than in experiments with only emtricitabine. The tenofovir mutation K65R was only 
observed in the fixed-dose experiment (at similar point in time for the combination and for the single 
agent), but not in the dose-escalation experiment.

Antiviral activity of emtricibabine was confirmed in SCID mice, reconstituted with human PBMCs which 
were  infected  with  HIV-1  A018.  In  vivo  activity  of  tenofovir  was  shown  in  SCID  mice  infected  with 
murine  sarcoma  virus,  in  FIV  infected  cats  and  in  SIV  infected  macaques.  In  neonatal  macaques, 
complete protection was obtained when one tenofovir dose was administered prior to inoculation and a 
second dose 24 h after inoculation. A combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine was effective against 
SIV in macaques with no evidence of resistance in 6 months. No in vivo studies were performed with 
rilpivirine.  Considering  the  sufficient  presence  of  in  vitro  data  and  the  limited  relevance  of  in  vivo 
animal data in this case (in animal studies, animal variants of the virus are investigated instead of the 
human HIV), this is endorsed. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Besides  antiviral  activity  against  human  hepatitis  B,  no  potential  off-target  activity is  expected  of  the 
triple  combination  emtricitabine,  rilpivirine  and  tenofovir  when  administered  at  therapeutic 
concentrations. In addition, at these concentrations, cytotoxicity of this fixed combination is expected 
to be low with no effect on DNA synthesis. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In contrast to emtricitabine and tenofovir, results of the in vitro hERG test reveal that rilpivirine has 
the potential to prolong the QT-interval. Delayed QT prolongation was also observed in a thorough QT 
study, in which healthy subjects were exposed to 75 and 300 mg rilpivirine. This QT prolonging 
potential and its delayed onset was confirmed by the results of the additional in vitro cardiovascular 
safety studies. However, none of the studies do explain the mechanism behind the (delayed) onset of 
QT prolongation observed in man. It might be concentration-related since it was only observed 
following exposure to concentrations exceeding the clinically relevant concentrations in man. QT 
prolongation might also be highly species-specific, since it was only observed in man and not in any of 
the animal models used, not even following exposure to supratherapeutic concentrations. The role of 
accumulation can not be excluded either. The applicant indicates that a steady-state plasma 
concentration of rilpivirine was reached at day 7 after starting treatment. The occurrence of 
accumulation following long-term treatment with the intended dose of 25 mg rilpivirine needs to be 
followed up. Overall, due to the results of the performed cardiovascular safety studies, the potential of 
rilpivirine to induce QT prolongation can still not be disregarded. Since the potential to induce QT 
prolongation was only observed in a human channel model and occurred after a certain time of delay, 
the applicant is requested as a post authorisation measure to investigate the whether species-specific 
metabolites maybe responsible for the QT prolongation of rilpivirine in man and the mechanism behind 
the QT prolongating and proarrhythmic potential of rilpivirine in man. 
Since none of the individual agents adversely affected the respiratory or central nervous system, it is 
not  to  be  expected  that  the  triple  combination  will  affect  these  organ  systems  when  administered  at 
therapeutic concentrations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In vitro, combinations of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir with agents in the NRTI, NNRTI, and PI 
classes  were  additive  or  synergistic.  No  antagonisms  were  observed  among  the  investigated 
combinations  with  emtricitabine,  rilpivirine  or  tenofovir.  The  combination  of  emtricitabine,  rilpivirine 
and tenofovir was synergistic.

Conclusion 
Based on in vitro efficacy data, the combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir is expected to 
be  effective,  and,  due  to  different  mutation  profiles  of  the  agents  and  the  inhibiting  effect  of  the 
combined  M184V/I  and  K65R  mutations  on  the  replication  capacity  of  the  virus,  resistance  is  not 
expected  to  be  increased  due  to  the  use  of  the  combination  and  may  possibly  even  be  delayed 
compared to the separate compounds.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
One  study  in  dogs  has  been  performed  on  the  kinetics  of  the  FTC/RPV/TDF  fixed-dose  combination. 
The  exposure  of  FTC/RPV/TDF  after  single  oral  administration  of  a  bilayer  formulation  and  the 
individual  compounds  was  compared  in  fasted  dogs  and  has  demonstrated  comparable  systemic 
exposure to all compounds.  
Other  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with  the  FTC/RPV/TDF  fixed-dose  combination.  Studies  with 
the  individual  compounds  showed  that  the  plasma  protein  binding  of  rilpivirine  is  high  in  all  species 
(>99%), while the binding of FTC and tenofovir to plasma proteins was very low (<10%). Therefore, it 
is  unlikely  when  the  drugs  are  co-administered  that  interactions  via  plasma  protein  binding  might 
occur. 
Rilpivirine-related material crosses the placenta barrier in rats. Also FTC and tenofovir are transferred 
across the placenta in animals.  
No  additional  preclinical  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  metabolism  of  emtricitabine, 
rilpivirine,  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  and  tenofovir.  Emtricitabine  is  metabolised  by  Phase  I 
enzymes (oxidation to a diastereometric sulfoxide) and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of 
the hydroxymethyl group), both to a limited extent. Rilpivirine is metabolised via hydroxylation (Phase 
I)  and  conjugation  (glutathione  and  glucuronide)  and  a  large  number  of  metabolites  were  detected. 
The pro-drug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is metabolised to tenofovir soproxil and tenofovir through 
cleavage  of  the  phosphoester  linkages  by  non-specific  esterases  in  blood  and  tissues.  Tenofovir  is 
anabolised  intracellular  to  an  active  diphosphorylated  species  (tenofovir  diphosphate)  and  no  other 
metabolic pathways have been observed for tenofovir. 
Rilpivirine  is  excreted  predominantly  by  faeces  but  both  tenofovir  and  emtricitabine  are  primarily 
excreted by the renal pathway. The clearance of both FTC and tenofovir is by glomerular filtration and 
active  tubular  secretion.  It  is  considered  unlikely  that  there  would  be  an  interaction  affecting 
elimination for the FTC/RPV/TDF fixed-dose combination. 
Both  rilpivirine  and  tenofovir  are  excreted  into  milk  in  animals.  Studies  on  excretion  into  milk  of  FTC 
are not performed. Based on this finding, it is reasonable to assume that rilpivirine and tenofovir are 
also excreted in human milk. 
No  additional  preclinical  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  potential  pharmacokinetic  drug 
interactions. However, based on the biotransformation data of the individual drugs, no interactions are 
expected  of  combining  emtricitabine,  rilpivirine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate.  Only  drug-drug 
interactions are expected for rilpivirine and tenofovir with other drugs as already stated for these drugs 
in  their  SmPC.  A  rilpivirine  toxicity  study  in  dogs  showed  changes  in  the  liver  which  suggest 
cholestasis,  which  indicates  that  rilpivirine  may  mediate  causative  and  adaptive  transporter  changes. 
Cholestasis  can  be  caused  by  alterations  of  transporter  function  in  the  liver,  such  as  sodium 
taurocholate  cotransporting  polypeptide  (NTCP),  organic  anion-transporting  polypeptides  (OATPs)  or 
multidrug resistance–associated proteins (MRPs). No information is given about possible effects of FTC, 
Eviplera

RPV  and  TDF  on  these  drug  transporters.  It  can  not  be  excluded  that  OATP  transporters  may  be 
involved  in  the  observed  cholestasis  in  dogs.  However,  as  cholestasis  was  not  observed  in  clinical 
studies,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  rilpivirine  will  lead  to  interaction  via 
drug transporters. 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  rilpivirine  metabolism  as  well  as  formation  of  all  its  metabolites  was  mainly 
catalysed  by  CYP3A4.  CYP1A1,  CYP1A2,  CYP1B1,  CYP2C8/9/10,  CYP2C18,  CYP2C19,  and  CYP3A5  are 
also  involved,  but  to  a  lesser  extent.  Also  CYP3A7  is  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  rilpivirine.  The 
apparent  Michaelis-Menten  constant  Km  and  Vmax  values  for  the  metabolism  of  14C-rilpivirine  in 
human liver microsomes were 4.17 μM and 381 pmol/mg/min, respectively. CYP3A5 is inactive in the 
majority  of  the  population.  However,  due  to  an  SNP  in  20-30%  of  the  population,  in  this  group, 
CYP3A5 may be more active than CYP3A4. Evidence regarding involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 is 
inconsistent throughout several experiments. However, clinical data indicate that any clinically relevant 
influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine is unlikely. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity and Repeat dose toxicity 
Toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  for  all  three  individual  agents,  and  for  the  combination  of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir. Provided toxicity data for emtricitabine and tenofovir are identical to data 
provided for the medicinal products already approved. Provided data for rilpivirine are identical to data 
for the rilpivirine 25mg single component that was evaluated in parallel as this fixed dose combination.  
No toxicity studies on the triple combination (Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir) have been performed.  
The  Applicant  has  submitted  a  comprehensive  package  of  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  for  rilpivirine. 
Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  sexually  immature  female 
monkeys. In all studies high exposure multiples were reached varying from 5 in the monkey to >500 in 
the mice at the highest dose. 
In  mice  the  target  organs  were  liver  and  kidney.  Additional  treatment-related  toxicity  was  seen  on 
haematopoiesis and the female genital organs possibly due to a reduced oestrus cycle. In rats target 
organ are liver and thyroid with accompanying changes in the serum thyroid hormone concentrations. 
Also  some  effects  on  red  blood  cell  parameters,  coagulation  and  pituitary  gland  were  apparent,  but 
mostly at higher doses and/or in males only. The effects on thyroid and pituitary were considered to be 
species-specific.  An  adverse  effect  of  rilpivirine  on  the  kidney  in  rats  cannot  be  fully  excluded  as 
reduced  kidney  weight  was  seen  in  the  high  dose  of  some  studies  and  some  changes  in  urine 
parameters  indicative  of  kidney  toxicity  were  noted  in  several  studies  including  the  carcinogenicity 
study.  However,  these  effects  were  seen  at  the  highest  dose  with  a  sufficient  safety  margin  and  in 
none of the studies were they accompanied by histopathological findings.  
In dogs the main target organs are the reproductive organs, adrenal gland and the liver. In particular, 
in  females  the  increased  hormonal  activity  (suggestive  of  increased  oestrus  cycling  was  noted  in 
ovaries,  and  uterus/vagina.  In  males  hypertrophy  of  Leydig  cells  and  decreased  spermiogenesis  was 
noted. Also changes in the sex hormones were noted. Adverse effects on then kidney were only seen in 
the 1 year toxicity study. 
In the juvenile monkey study rilpivirine was very well tolerated by the immature females but an effect 
on  the  adrenal  steroidogenesis  was  noted  leading  to  a  change  of  17-OH-progesterone,  progesterone, 
DHEA  and  androstenedione  levels.  In  addition  minimal  follicular  cell  hypertrophy  in  thyroid  was  also 
observed already at the lowest dose tested.  
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 19/90
 
 
 
The  Applicant  has  performed  additional  mechanistical  studies  to  explain  the  observations  on  the 
adrenal gland and steroid hormone levels. From these studies it was concluded that these effects were 
most likely caused by partial inhibition of cytochrome CYP21 and CYP17 (enzymes are involved in the 
adrenal  steroid  synthesis).  It  was  postulated  that  the  effects  seen  on  the  reproductive  organs  were 
caused  by  the  rilpivirine  -induced  effects  on  the  steroid  hormone  synthesis.  These  effects  were  not 
seen in the clinic. 
Several  target  organs  of  toxicity  are  shared  between  rilpivirine  and  emtricitabine  or  rilpivirine  and 
tenofovir.  These  include  the  kidney,  liver  enzymes,  haemotopoiesis,  and  possibly  also  ovaries,  testes 
and  thyroid.  Potential  toxicological  interactions  of  rilpivirine  with  either  emtricitabine  or  tenofovir 
cannot be excluded. However given the amount of clinical data with the combination, and in line with 
the scientific advice the lack of a non-clinical toxicity study of the combination is accepted. 
Genotoxicity 
Neither rilpivirine nor emtricitabine showed to have a genotoxic potential in the standard battery of in 
vitro and in vivo tests, at the highest feasible concentration or dose. Some equivocal results were 
obtained with tenofovir. 
Carcinogenicity 
In long term carcinogenicity studies of emtricitabine, no drug-related increases in tumour incidence 
were found in rats and mice. Long term carcinogenicity study in rats with tenofovir DF did not show 
any carcinogenic potential. Mice showed a low incidence of duodenal tumours, considered likely related 
to high local concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract at the highest dose of 600 mg/kg. Rilpivirine 
induced increases in liver tumours in mice and rat and in the thyroid in the rat. These tumours were 
caused by the induction of liver enzymes, which is a rodent-specific mechanism and not relevant to 
humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No  effect  on  male  or  female  fertility  was  noted  in  fertility  studies  in  rats  treated  with  rilpivirine, 
emtricitabine or tenofovir.  
There  were  no  marked  effects  of  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  in  embryo-foetal  development  studies. 
Rilpivirine did cause some foetal deviations in rat and rabbits at doses at or below maternal toxicity. In 
the  rat  embryo-foetal  development  study  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  dilated  renal 
pelvis  increased  dose  related  (0/140,  2/155,  5/149,  7/149)  was  noted.  However  all  incidences  were 
below  the  maximal  historical  control,  and  high  exposure  multiples  were  reached  in  this  study.  It  was 
thus concluded that this effect is most likely not of toxicological relevance. In rabbits the incidence of 
branches of left subclavian artery and hypoplastic interparietal bone was increased.  
No marked effects were noted in the peri/post-natal development study with rilpivirine or emtricitabine 
in the rat. Some signs of embryo/pup toxicity were noted for tenofovir.

Regarding the Environmental Risk Assessment of emtricitabine, since PECsurfacewater is above 0.01 μg/L a 
phase II assessment has been performed. Results from phase IIa studies do not indicate any risks for 
the  surfacewater,  groundwater,  STP  and  sediment  compartments.  Based  on  the  log  Kow  value, 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 23/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emtricitabine  is  not  considered  PBT  nor  vPvB.  Considering  the  above  data,  emtricitabine  is  not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Rilpivirine is very persistent in the environment ((v)P). However the bioconcentration study showed 
that rilpivirine is not B, thus the compound is not PBT nor vPvB. Since PECsurfacewater is above 0.01 
μg/L, a phase II assessment has been performed. Results from phase IIa studies do not indicate any 
risk for the surface water, groundwater and STP.  
For  tenofovir,  since  the  PECsurfacewater is  above  0.01  μg/L,  a  phase  II  assessment  has  been  performed. 
Results  from  phase  IIa  studies  indicate  no  risks  for  the  surfacewater,  ground  water  and  STP 
compartments. Based on the log Kow value, tenofovir DF is not considered PBT nor vPvB.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
For rilpivirine the applicant should submit studies in accordance with OECD 123 (regarding the 
determination of log Kow) and OECD 106 (regarding sediment and soil compartment). 
For tenofovir the applicant should submit a study on effects on sediment dwelling organisms (Hyalella 
sp; Lumbriculus sp. Or Chironomus sp.) according to OECD 218. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on in vitro efficacy data, the combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir is expected to 
be  effective,  and,  due  to  different  mutation  profiles  of  the  agents  and  the  inhibiting  effect  of  the 
combined  M184V/I  and  K65R  mutations  on  the  replication  capacity  of  the  virus,  resistance  is  not 
expected  to  be  increased  due  to  the  use  of  the  combination  and  may  possibly  even  be  delayed 
compared to the separate compounds.  
Based on the biotransformation data of the individual drugs, no interactions are expected of combining 
emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  
The  toxicological/safety  profile  of  rilpivirine  is  acceptable.  Further  investigation  regarding  QT 
prolongation by rilpivirine will be provided in accordance with the measures in the RMP. 
Data  from  the  single  components  is  considered  acceptable.  Therefore  no  safety  studies  have  been 
performed with the triple combination, as agreed during the scientific advice. 
Sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3 SmPC were updated to reflect the relevant non-clinical data. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measure to be included in the RMP necessary to address the 
following non-clinical issues: 
Since the potential to induce QT prolongation was only observed in a human channel model and 
occurred after a certain time of delay, the applicant will investigate whether species-specific 
metabolites may be responsible for the QT prolongation of rilpivirine in man and the mechanism behind 
the QT prolongating and proarrhythmic potential of rilpivirine in man. 
With respect to the Environmental Risk Assessment and in the context of the obligation of the MAH to 
take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following point to be 
addressed: 
For rilpivirine, the Applicant should submit studies in accordance with OECD 123 (regarding the 
determination of log Kow) and OECD 106 (regarding sediment and soil compartment). 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report

For tenofovir the applicant should submit a study on effects on sediment dwelling organisms (Hyalella 
sp; Lumbriculus sp. Or Chironomus sp.) according to OECD 218. 
The applicant was recommended based on available samples from patients, to further elaborate on the 
impact of CYP3A5 on the exposure of rilpivirine. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Furthermore,  the  applicant  performed  bioequivalence  studies.  The  phase  I  bioequivalence  study  GS-
US-264-0103  forms  the  basis  for  this  application  as  it  establishes  bioequivalence  between  the  FDC 
tablet and the concurrent administration of the individual agents. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed for all three individual agents, and for the combination 
of emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada). Provided phamacokinetic data for emtricitabine and tenofovir 
are  identical  to  data  provided  for  the  three  medicinal  products  already  approved.  Provided  data  for 
rilpivirine are identical to data for rilpivirine 25 mg single component that was evaluated in parallel of 
this fixed dose combination.  
Rilpivirine pharmacokinetics has been studied as primary or secondary objective in 33 conducted Phase 
I, II and III trials. Four validated bioanalytical assays LC-MS/MS were used during development. When 
Eviplera

exposed to light the drug is transformed to another isomeric form (Z- isomer); selectivity towards the 
Z-isomer has been demonstrated. 
Absorption  
Rilpivirine is a poorly soluble (even less at pH above 2) drug with intermediate permeability in vitro.  
Efflux data indicate that rilpivirine may be a substrate for P-gp. 
There is no indication of increased bioavailability with increasing dose above 25 mg hence the impact 
of active efflux for rilpivirine absorption seems not relevant at the chosen dose level. 
Absolute bioavailability has not been determined. Comparable bioavailability is obtained with phase II 
and Phase III tablet forms.  
The influence of food is substantial where normal fat and high fat meal result in similar exposure while 
if taken in fasting state the AUC is reduced by about 40%. If taken with only a protein rich nutritional 
drink  the  exposure  is  reduced  by  50%  as  compared  to  a  normal  fat  meal.  Influence  of  food  has  not 
been  studied  for  the  combination  product  but  the  effect  on  the  rilpivirine  monoproduct  is  considered 
worst  case  also  for  the  combination  product.  Eviplera  is  recommended  to  be  taken  with  a  meal  to 
ensure optimal absorption. 
Distribution 
Blood  to  plasma  ratio  was  0.65-0.75  indicating  limited  distribution  to  blood  cells.  Plasma  protein 
binding was on average 99.7%. Rilpivirine was extensively bound to albumin and to a lesser extent to 
alpha  acid  glycoprotein.  Apparent  volume  of  distribution  was  estimated  to  be  152  l  in  the  Phase  III 
population analysis. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life was around 45-50 hours across trials. 
Rilpivirine is metabolised by hydroxylation, oxidation, glucuronidation and conjugation with glutathion. 
At 14 days after the administration of a single oral dose of radiolabelled rilpivirine, on average 85.1% 
± 4.0% of the administered radioactivity had been excreted via the faeces. The average recovery in 
urine was 6.1% ± 2.1% with only trace amounts ( 0.03%) of unchanged rilpivirine. The total 
radioactivity recovered was about 91.2 ± 5.1%. Only sixty % of the excreted radioactivity was 
identified. The major loss in radioactivity appears to be caused by the fact that late faeces samples 
were not analysed for metabolites, some during extraction and some not identified. Unchanged drug 
was excreted in faeces and accounted for 25.5% of the dose on average (range 12.1-33.4%). No 
quantitative conclusion can be made on the origin but some of the unchanged drug may originate from 
poor absorption (solubility issue at higher doses). It can also not be excluded that biliary excretion of 
rilpivirine exists as an elimination pathway.  
In plasma, unchanged drug accounted for a major part of the total radioactivity (76% based on Cmax 
and 51% based on AUClast). Fifty nine - 84 % of the drug related plasma exposure has been identified. 
Several metabolites were detected in plasma (glucuronides, direct and following oxidation, tricyclic and 
hydroxymethyl metabolite). Two metabolites were tested for antiviral activity M33 (hydroxymethyl-
rilpivirine, which constituted 4-11% of parent exposure in plasma) had similar activity on wild type 
virus while metabolite 42 (oxidation at the pyrimidinyl moiety, main metabolite in faeces, 16% of dose) 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 26/90
 
 
 
 
had 36 times lower activity. Neither is active on resistant strains. Possible contribution of metabolites 
to the QTc effect will be further investigated according to the measure mentioned in the RMP. 
In vitro data suggest that CYP3A4 is the major pathway involved in metabolism of rilpivirine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Less than dose proportional increase in exposure at higher doses was observed, which is likely due to 
the  limited  solubility  of  the  substance.  The  assessment  of  dose  proportionality  at  lower  doses  was 
hampered  by  the  fact  that  parallel  group  design  was  applied  in  all  studies.  Approximately  dose 
proportional  increase  was  observed  in  healthy  subjects  up  to  200  mg  while  in  patients  some  studies 
indicated  less  than  proportional  increase  already  at  lower  doses  while  others  suggested  dose 
proportional  increase.  Only  one  dose  with  currently  no  dose  adjustment  is  applied  for.  Hence, 
assessment of dose proportionality in patients is currently not essential. 
No time dependency was obvious however no comparison of CL/F between first dose and steady state 
dose within study was provided. Based on interaction data limited induction is expected at a dose of 25 
mg, hence this issue will not be further pursued. 
Special populations 
Interindividual variability was about 40%CV in oral clearance. No estimate on interoccasion variability 
in CL/F has been provided. 
In the population PK study of the Phase IIb trial 20-30% lower exposure was observed in patients as 
compared  to  healthy  volunteers.  In  the  Phase  III  studies  comparison  was  made  with  on  study  C152 
(second thorough QT study). The exposure was 40 % lower in patients. Other data in healthy subjects 
suggest that Study C152 was at the higher end of exposures observed in healthy subjects. 
No study has been performed in patients with renal impairment. Increased total exposure (47%) was 
observed  in a  study  with  mild  hepatic  impairment,  while  no  effect  on  total exposure  was  observed  in 
moderate  hepatic  impairment.  The  available  pharmacokinetic  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment  is  very  limited  and  very  few  subjects  appear  by  score  to  have  an  affected  metabolic 
capacity. It cannot be excluded that the effect on unbound exposure would be larger in other subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment. Safety data is very limited in subjects with hepatic impairment. A 
cautious use is recommended in the SmPC. 
No  clinically relevant impact  of  sex,  race  (White, Black  or Asian),  weight  or  BMI  on  rilpivirine  PK  was 
identified  in  the  population  PK  analysis.  There  is  essentially  no  data  in  elderly  (2  subjects  above  65) 
and no conclusions regarding elderly can be made. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In  vivo  interaction  data  was  to  a  large  extent  obtained  with  rilpivirine  at  a  higher  dose  (150  mg)  in 
healthy  subjects.  Steady  state  conditions  for  the  interactions  were  aimed  for.  No  interaction  studies 
have been performed with the fixed dose combination.

Table 3. Some main DDI studies for rilpivirine 
No effect of tenofovir, didanosine, sildenafil, atorvastatin, anticontraceptives or methadone on 
rilpivirine exposure was observed. 
Inducers of CYP3A affected the exposure of rilpivirine and can affect as such the efficacy. 
Therefore the anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; the 
antimycobacterials: rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine; the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, 
except as a single dose treatment and St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are contra-indicated. 
Drugs affecting the gastric pH substantially also affected the exposure of rilpivirine. Therefore proton 
pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole are 
contra-indicated. 
Staggered dosing is suggested for H2 antagonists and antacids. 
No dose adjustments are suggested for CY3A inhibitors.

Further data on interaction studies with raltegravir and rifabutin will be provided according to the 
measures mentioned in the RMP. 
Rilpivirine exhibit a dose dependent induction in vivo with limited or no effect observed at lower doses 
than 150 mg q.d. At a dose of 25 mg no relevant impact on substrates of CYP3A, CYP2E1 and CYP2C19 
is expected. Tenofovir exposure was increased by 23% when co-administered with rilpivirine (150 mg). 
The mechanism is not fully clear; the clinical relevance of this interaction is further discussed under 
safety. 
Bioequivalence studies 
Two bioequivalence studies have been submitted for the FDC. Study GS-US-264-0101 studied two 
development formulations that failed to demonstrate bioequivalence. Study GS-US-264-0103 studied 
the proposed commercial formulation (formulation 3) of the fixed dose combination and also a different 
fixed dose development formulation (formulation 4) that failed to demonstrate bioequivalence. 
Bioequivalence was evaluated in study GS-US-264-0103, which was a single-dose, three-treatment, 
three-period, six-sequence single-dose crossover study conducted in 36 (34 completed) healthy 
volunteers, comparing the proposed commercial formulation of the fixed dose combination tablet with 
the individual components emtricitabine (hard capsule), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tablet), and 
rilpivirine (tablet) under fed conditions (standardised breakfast (representative of a healthy diet)). The 
study was conducted in USA between 12th February 2010 (first subject screened) and 12th April 2010 
(last subject observation).  
Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 192 hours post-dose. The study design is considered 
acceptable. Plasma concentrations of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir were determined with 
validated LC/MS/MS methods.  
The tables below show that for formulation 3 (the one used in the clinical trials) For AUC0-t and Cmax 
the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the conventional 
acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for all three substances.

Table 6. Statistical comparisons of tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters for Test versus 
Reference treatments. 
The study was performed under fed conditions, as rilpivirine should be taken with food. This is also the 
case for tenofovir (Viread). Emtricitabine can be taken with or without food as food did not affect 
systemic exposure. Furthermore, the combination tablet of emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada) 
recommends taking the tablet with food. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamics  for  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  are  well  described.  Only  data  pertaining  to 
rilpivirine is further discussed. 
Mechanism of action 
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell 
line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/ml).  
The activity to HIV-2 is, in line with other NNRTI compounds, much lower. Such virus is not of interest 
for the clinical development of rilpivirine. 
Resistance 
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different 
origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1.  
- 
In sequential passages of different fixed doses of rilpivirine, no virus was seen using 40 nM or 
higher.  
- 
Passages with gradually increasing dose, starting low, suggested the in vitro genotypic profile 
for rilpivirine to be:  V90I, L100I, K101E, V106A/I, V108I, E138G/K/Q/R, V179F/I, Y181C/I, 
V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C, and M230I/L. 
Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data, the following amino acid substitutions, when 
present at baseline, are likely to affect the activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, 
E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, H221Y, F227C, M230I, and M230L. The basis for this list 
of rilpivirine-associated mutations is discussed in more detail in section Failure and Resistance 
development in the clinical part. The fold changes seen with the most common rilpivirine-associated 
single mutations are low to modest. 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 30/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is of major importance to understand that this list only refers to treatment naïve patients, prior to 
starting therapy, and previously treatment naïve patients failing therapy with rilpivirine. In contrast, 
this list is not sufficient for a safe use in patients with prior virological failure with another NNRTI-
based regimen. This is because a large number of NNRTI-associated mutations were used as exclusion 
criteria in the clinical studies. In addition to in vitro selection studies, that list of excluding mutations 
was based on data from the literature, and also included mutations not known to be associated to 
rilpivirine (or efavirenz).  
Hence,  the efficacy of rilpivirine in patients with virus showing the NNRTI mutations listed as exclusion 
criteria, but not selected for within the in vitro studies (or in vivo), has in fact not been studied. It is 
not straightforward to rely on in vitro sensitivity to make extrapolated assumptions about clinical 
activity against the excluded mutants/polymorphisms, since the in vitro fold changes are relatively low 
also for mutations clearly associated with virological failure on rilpivirine. 
In addition to the mutations included in the list above, mutation M184I (intermediate mutation in the 
development of typical lamivudine/emtricitabine resistance) doubles the fold change of the most 
common rilpivirine-associated mutation E138K, and is in practice directly involved in the resistance 
score. This double mutation, E138K+M184I, was indeed the most common mutation pattern in 
patients failing rilpivirine in the phase 3 studies. Interestingly this pair of mutations were found in 
patients with the tenofovir/FTC backbone - but not in those treated with zidovudine/3TC (true for both 
phase 3 and phase 2b studies), and in only 1 patient treated with abacavir (low numbers), table 7 
below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted are considered satisfactory. The influence of 
rilpivirine with food is substantial where normal fat and high fat meal result in similar exposure while if 
taken in fasting state the AUC is reduced by about 40%. 
In addition, the fixed dose combination tablet should also be taken with a meal (SmPC 
recommendation). As such, the study design applied in the bioequivalence study is acceptable. 
Eviplera should be taken with a meal to ensure optimal absorption. This information is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted are considered satisfactory. 
The CHMP considers the following measures as part of the RMP necessary to further characterise the 
pharmacology of the product: 
- To further investigate inhibitory properties (time dependent) of rilpivirine on CYP2C9 
- To provide further data on interaction studies with raltegravir and rifabutin 
- To perform an interaction study with metformin, which also includes investigations of the MATE 
inhibitory potential of rilpivirine 
- To submit a report of the metabolite profiling and decision on synthesis of disproportional metabolites 
in relation to QT prolongation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
Clinical efficacy was determined on the clinical dossier which consisted of established data for 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , and new data presented on RPV (when used in 
combination with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) which consist of (see Figure 4):  
  2 phase IIa studies proof-of-principle (functional) monotherapy studies in ARV-naïve (C201) 
and ARV-experienced (C202) HIV-1 infected patients to confirm its antiviral activity. 
  1 phase IIb dose finding study in ARV naïve HIV-1 infected adults with rilpivirine 25 mg, 75mg 
or 150 mg q.d. 
  2 pivotal phase III randomized trials (C209 and C215) in ARV naïve HIV-1 infected adults 
comparing rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. plus 2 N(t)RTIs to efavirenz 600 mg q.d. plus 2 N(t)RTIs.   
Figure 4.
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Phase IIa studies 
Two  phase  IIa  proof-of-principle  studies  were  performed  with  rilpivirine  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  to 
confirm its antiviral activity. One study (C201) explored the efficacy of different dosages  of rilpivirine 
mono-therapy  in  treatment-naïve  patients  (n  =  36  received  rilpivirine)  while  the  other  study  (C202) 
explored  the  efficacy  of  different  dosages  of  rilpivirine  in  treatment-experienced  patients  (n  =  36 
received  rilpivirine)  as  a  substitute  for  a  failing  NNRTI  or  protease  inhibitor  (PI)  (=  functional  mono-
therapy).  The  treatment  duration  in  both  studies  was  limited  to  7  days  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report

Rev06.11 
 
 
 
 
emergence  of  mutations.  Both  studies  confirmed  a  significant  in  vivo  activity  to  HIV-1  of  different 
dosages  (25  mg  –  150  mg  q.d.)  of  rilpivirine.  Based  on  these  results  a  final  dose-finding  phase  IIb 
study was performed (C204). 
A 1.2 log10 reduction of HIV-RNA was seen, with no relevant difference between doses tested. This 
means that the potency of rilpivirine is low compared to other agents (raltegravir > 2log10 reduction, 
PI/r around -2log10, efavirenz -1.6 log10; tenofovir and abacavir around 1.6 log10 reduction in 
monotherapy).   
No emerging resistance in the RT gene was detected at any time during treatment, using population 
sequencing. 
Phase IIb study 
C204 is a randomized, active controlled, partially blinded (to dose of rilpivirine) trial in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1  patients  to  evaluate  the  dose-response,  efficacy,  tolerability,  and  safety  of  a  96-week  regimen 
with 3 doses (25mg, 75 mg and 150mg) of rilpivirine. The active comparator was EFV 600 q.d. and all 
patients 
received  a  background 
regimen  of  2  N(t)RTIs  selected  by 
the 
investigators 
(tenofovir/emtricitabie,  abacavir/lamivudine  or  zidovudine/lamivudine).  After  96  weeks  all  patients 
were offered to continue or switch their study medication to rilpivirine 75 q.d. After 144 weeks, based 
on  the  evaluation  of  the  96  weeks  data,  they  were  switched  to  rilpivirine  25  q.d.  This  trial  is  still 
ongoing to obtain long-term (up to 240 weeks) efficacy and safety data.  
It should be noted that the rilpivirine 25 mg formulation (F001) used in this trial is different from the 
formulation (F006) used in the pivotal phase III trials The current request for marketing authorization 
concerns the latter rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. formulation (F006). The different formulations are considered 
to be bioequivalent. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria were those commonly used for treatment naïve patients. Two specific 
issues are considered particularly relevant. 1) An extensive number of NNRTI-associated mutations 
constituted exclusion criteria (n=37); 2) A cortisol level on the screening assessment requested for 
inclusion. This criterion was the major reason for screening failures (around 8% of screened patients). 
The reason for this and for endocrine monitoring performed, were effects on the steroid hormones 
seen pre-clinically.  
The  study  included  HIV-1  infected  ARV  treatment  naïve  adults  with  a  plasma  viral  load  of  >  5,000 
copies/mL  who  were  appropriate  to  initiate  ART  according  to  the  investigator’s  judgment,  who  were 
susceptible to the selected ARV regimen (according to baseline genotyping). 
As  defined  by  exclusion  criteria  all  subjects  were  relatively  healthy  (e.g.  life  expectancy  >  6  months, 
absence of AIDS defining illness, absence of renal impairment or other significant coexisting illness).  
Of 515 screened subjects, 368 (71%) were randomized and received treatment (≈ n = 90 per 
treatment arm). The most common reasons for screen failures were cortisol levels outside the required 
levels, abnormal lab values and viral load values ≤ 5,000 copies/mL.  The proportion of screen failures 
excluded because of NNRTI RAMs from the exclusion list was 3.5% (5/142); this represented 1.0% of 
the total screened population (5/515). The mutations observed at screening in these 5 subjects were 
K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A. All of these mutations are listed in the most recent IAS-USA 
December 2010 Resistance Mutations Update as associated with resistance to NNRTIs. 
The  demographics  were  quite  representative  of  today’s  patients,  including  race  other  than  white  and 
non-B  subtypes  being  well  represented.  Discontinuations  were  rather  common  with  around  25%  of 
Eviplera

patients  stopping  therapy  prior  to  week  96  for  various  reasons.  However,  reasons  for  stopping  were 
not markedly different between the treatment arms, including the control. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  virologic  response  (<  50 
copies/mL,  TLOVR)  at  96  weeks  which  demonstrated  rilpivirine  to  be  efficacious  across  different 
dosages. 
Results are presented in table 8 below.

Numbers  are  small  for  proper  sub  analyses  regarding  dose  dependency  according  to  baseline  VL. 
However,  the  difference  between  doses  25  mg  and  150  mg  in  patients  with  a  baseline  VL  >100000  
(94% vs 72%) is significant at week 48.  
The  majority  of  patients  were  taking  zidovudine/lamivudine  in  this  study  (75%),  in  contrast  to  the 
pivotal studies. 
Rilpivirine seems to be doing better when combined with zidovudine/3TC (given in low income regions) 
than with tenofovir/FTC (given in EU/US) and it is not expected that EU and US study sites yield worse 
outcomes than sites in the other regions of this study (this trend is further discussed in the main 
clinical studies).  
The  efficacy  of  rilpivirine  was  maintained  up  to  192  weeks  of  treatment.  By  Week  144,  64.5%  of 
subjects had maintained virologic response (< 50 copies/mL, TLOVR) (note that all rilpivirine recipients 
used  75  mg  q.d.  between  week  96  and  144).  By  Week  192,  a  total  of  58.8%  of  subjects  taking 
rilpivirine  had  maintained  virologic  response  (note  that  all  rilpivirine  recipients  used  25  mg  q.d. 
between  week  144  and  192).    These  long  term  outcomes  were  similar  to  the  results  in  the  control 
group (EFV 600 mg q.d.). 
Thirty-one  of  279  subjects  (11.1%)  randomized  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and  8  of  89  subjects  (9.0%) 
randomized  in  the  control  (EFV)  group  experienced  virological  failure  at  the  time  of  the  Week  192 
analysis.  For  21/30  patients  treated  with  TCM278  and  with  available  genotypic  and  phenotypic  data, 
emergence  of  reverse  transcriptase  mutations  was  observed.  The  most  frequently  emerging  reverse 
transcriptase  mutations  were:  L74V,  K101E,  V108I,  E138K,  E138R,  I178L,  Y181C,  M184V,  M184I, 
M230L,  and  N348I.  Thirteen  of  the  30  subjects  had  emerging  nucleoside/tide  reverse  transcriptase 
inhibitor  resistance  associated  mutations.  Emergence  of  M184V  or  M184I  (associated  to  the

development  of  resistance  to  lamivudine  and  emtricitabine)  was  observed  in  the  rilpivirine  group  but 
not  in  the  control  (EFV)  group.  In  the  control  (EFV)  group,  the  emerging  non-nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase  inhibitor  resistance-associated  mutations  observed  in  the  subjects  experiencing 
virological failure were K103N and V106M. 
Subjects experiencing virological failure in the rilpivirine group with phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine 
were  generally  cross-resistant  to  etravirine  and  efavirenz,  and  subjects  from  the  control  (EFV)  group 
with phenotypic resistance to EFV retained sensitivity to rilpivirine and etravirine. 
Dose selection  
A  dose-response  relationship  could  not  be  demonstrated.  However,  initially  the  75  mg  q.d.  dose  was 
selected for the Phase III trials and further development of rilpivirine because, though not statistically 
significant, the proportion of virologic failures in the rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. group was 8.6% compared 
to 5.3% and 6.6% in the 75 mg q.d. and 150 mg q.d. dose groups, respectively. Furthermore, there 
was a trend towards lower efficacy of the 25 mg q.d group among those with a high baseline viral load. 
Later, data became available demonstrating a possible dose-response relationship with respect to AEs 
(see below and safety assessment).  
A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between change from baseline in QTcF 
interval and exposure (AUC24h) to rilpivirine (p < 0.001) as illustrated by the following scatterplot 
(Figure 5).  
Figure 5. Scatter-plot of rilpivirine AUC24h vs the Maximum Change in QTcF Interval From Baseline 
(Phase IIb Trial C204) 
Thus rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. formulation was finally chosen for further evaluation in phase III studies as 
well as the prolonged arm of this phase IIb study.  
A concern was raised on the possible suboptimal dose of 25 mg q.d. in terms of efficacy, especially 
among patients with high baseline viral load, and the applicant was requested to further clarifiy the 
relation between dosage, exposure, efficacy, virologic failure and emergence of resistance stratified by 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report

baseline viral load. The phase IIb study did not show a dose-response in terms of virologic response 
for both low and high baseline viral load categories, however, there was a tendency towards a lower 
reponse in patients with lower AUC, although there was a large overlap in AUC values between 
responders and non-responders. This trend was also observed within the phase 3 studies using the 25 
mg dose based on population PK. Also within the dose-finding study there appeared a trend for higher 
rates of emerging resistance in the lowest dose group of 25 mg TCM278 q.d. and especially for 
patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/ml. Analyses of phase 3 studies stratified by 
baseline viral load showed lower virologic response, higher rate of virologic failure, and increased risk 
of resistance for patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/ml compared to control group and 
compared to patients with lower baseline viral load. It remains unknown whether an intermediate dose 
of 50 mg rilpivirine q.d. would allow enhancing the virological suppression at the level of efavirenz 
without exposing to a critical risk of QT prolongation.  
2.5.2.  Main studies  
C209 and C215 
The two phase III studies (C209 and C215) are both randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, trials 
of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus EFV 600 mg q.d. in combination with a fixed background regimen 
consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (C209) or with a background regimen 
containing 2 investigator initiated N(t)RTIs (either ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC or TDF/FTC) (C215) in ARV-
naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
The design of these trials were similar and therefore there is a common description. The outcomes are 
presented separately together with the pooled data.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
Included HIV-1 infected adults with a plasma viral load of > 5,000 copies/mL who were appropriate to 
initiate ART according to the investigator’s judgment, had never received ARV treatment, who were 
susceptible to the selected background regimen at screening, and who had no NNRTI RAMs from a 
predefined list were eligible for this trial (A098G, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, F227C, 
G190A, G190C, G190E, G190Q, G190S, G190T,K101E, K101P, K101Q, K103H, K103N, K103S, K103T, 
K238N, K238T, L100I, M230I, M230L, P225H,P236L, V106A, V106M, V108I, V179D, V179E, Y181C, 
Y181I, Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, Y318F).  
Exclusion criteria were the use of disallowed concomitant therapy, life expectancy < 6 months, 
presence of AIDS defining illness except cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma and HIV wasting syndrome, acute 
HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 coinfection, any active clinically significant disease, subjects with a risk factor 
for QTc prolongation, pregnancy or breastfeeding, absence of effective birth control methods, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50mL/min.   
Both trials are conducted in USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and Latin America with some 
differences seen in the proportions of subjects recruited per region and country between the two 
trials.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rilpivirine 25 mg q.d or to EFV 600 mg q.d. 
(control) plus a background regimen containing TDF/FTC (C209) or 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs 
(either ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC or TDF/FTC) (C215).  
Rilpivirine (or placebo) q.d. should have been taken with food, preferably breakfast, each dose 
separated by approximately 24 hours. EFV (or placebo) q.d., was taken on an empty stomach, 
preferably at bedtime, each dose separated by approximately 24 hours. The background regimen was 
recommended to be taken at the same time as rilpivirine (or placebo). Due to the differences in 
administration with or without food, a double-dummy design was chosen so subjects receiving active 
rilpivirine also took placebo EFV (and vice versa) in addition to their background regimen. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with rilpivirine 25 mg q.d 
compared to control (EFV 600 mg q.d.) in regard to the proportion of virologic responders (plasma 
viral load < 50 human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-1 ribonucleic acid [RNA] copies/mL, according to 
the TLOVR algorithm at 48 weeks, with a maximum allowable difference of 12%. 
Secondary objectives included: 
- demonstrate non-inferiority of rilpivirine compared to EFV with a maximum allowable difference of 
10% at 48 weeks for the primary efficacy endpoint; 
- evaluate superiority in efficacy of rilpivirine compared to EFV, in case non-inferiority was established; 
- evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of rilpivirine when administered as 25 mg q.d. 
versus (vs.) EFV over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate and compare the antiviral activity of rilpivirine when administered as 25 mg q.d. vs. EFV 
over 
48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate and compare immunologic changes (as measured by CD4+ cell count) in the rilpivirine 
group vs. those in the EFV group over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- assess the evolution of the viral genotype and phenotype over 48 and 96 weeks; 
- evaluate the population pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships 
for efficacy and safety of rilpivirine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of subjects with virologic response, i.e. a viral 
load < 50 HIV-1 copies/mL at Week 48, according to the time to loss of virologic response 
(TLOVR) algorithm. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of subjects with virologic response, i.e., a 
plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL, according to the FDA’s TLOVR algorithm. Based on previous trials 
with EFV, the proportion of virologic responders (response rate) in the control group was expected to 
be approximately 70–80%. Assuming a response rate of 75% at 48 weeks for both treatment options, 
it was calculated that 340 subjects would be needed per treatment group (rilpivirine or control) to 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 37/90
 
 
 
 
 
establish non-inferiority of rilpivirine vs. EFV with a maximum allowable difference of 12%, at 95% 
power. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either rilpivirine or EFV. Randomization was stratified by 
screening viral load (strata were ≤ 100,000; > 100,000 - ≤ 500,000; and > 500,000 copies/mL) and 
for trial C215 also by background regimen (ABC/3TC, AZT/3TC, TDF/FTC). 
Predefined randomization schedules using permuted blocks were applied to ensure balance across 
treatment groups in the strata and random treatment assignment. 
Blinding (masking) 
After randomization on Day 1, neither Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, the investigator, nor the subjects who 
had been allocated to one of the double-blind NNRTI treatments (rilpivirine or EFV) were aware of the 
identity of their treatment. In addition to the investigator-selected N(t)RTIs, subjects assigned to one 
of the double-blind treatments took 2 tablets daily, either: 
- Active rilpivirine and EFV placebo 
- Active EFV and rilpivirine placebo 
The placebo tablets were identical in appearance to their respective active treatments. 
The primary analysis was performed once all randomized subjects had been treated for 48 weeks, or 
had been withdrawn earlier (cut-off date 28 January 2010). For this analysis, the blind was broken for 
Tibotec Pharmaceuticals but not for subjects, investigators, and monitors who interact with site 
personnel. 
Once the trial is completed (96-week data and follow-up visits) and the database is locked, a final 
analysis will be performed on all available data. The investigator will receive a copy of the 
randomization codes for the subjects participating in his/her center, clearly identifying the treatment 
numbers and the corresponding treatment group (rilpivirine or control). 
A DSMB was installed to monitor the safety of the subjects included in the trial. Blinded data was sent 
to the DSMB every 16 weeks. A summary of SAEs, grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation was provided on a monthly basis. Two formal DSMB analyses were performed: the first 
when 340 randomized subjects (50% of the planned number of subjects) had reached ≥12 weeks of 
treatment or discontinued, and the second when almost all randomized subjects had reached 24 weeks 
of treatment or discontinued. Data of these analyses were shared with the DSMB but not with Tibotec 
Pharmaceuticals (other than the Sponsor Review Committee) or site personnel directly involved in trial 
conduct. In these analyses, the treatment code was partially unblinded (up to code level) to the DSMB, 
but not revealed to Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (other than the Sponsor Review Committee). Involvement 
of the Sponsor Review Committee in these analyses was according to the DSMB Charter. Although full 
unblinding did not occur, if deemed necessary by the DSMB, treatment codes could be fully unblinded 
to the DSMB members only. Based on these analyses, the DSMB recommended that the trial could 
continue without modification. 
Statistical methods 
The intent-to treat (ITT) population was defined as the set of all subjects who were randomized and 
who took at least 1 dose of study medication, regardless of their adherence with the protocol 
or their eligibility. 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 38/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
The per protocol (PP) population was defined as the set of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 
dose of study medication and experienced no major protocol violations during the trial. 
The primary population was the ITT population. However, since an analysis on the ITT population may 
not be conservative in a non-inferiority setting, an analysis based on the PP population was also 
performed to investigate the impact of exclusion of subjects with major protocol violations and to 
evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. 
The safety analyses were performed on the ITT population. 
The primary efficacy variable in the primary population (ITT) was compared between rilpivirine 
and control at the Week 48 time point, adjusted for factors treatment group and background 
regimen (C215), and using baseline log10 plasma viral load as a continuous variable. The model-based 
odds ratio for rilpivirine relative to control was presented along with the associated 95% CI. The 
predicted proportion of responders with 95% CI as well as the differences in these proportions with 
95% CI, based on the above logistic regression model, for the rilpivirine and control was calculated. 
A p-value for non-inferiority of rilpivirine compared with control was provided for a maximum 
allowable difference of 12% (the primary efficacy analysis) and 10% (secondary efficacy 
analysis). A p-value for superiority of rilpivirine compared with control was also provided where 
non-inferiority was achieved.

Screening failures 
The reasons for screening failures are displayed in the following Table 9 (of note: as subjects could 
have more than one reason for screening failure these numbers outweigh the number of patients):

Of  1895  screened  patients,  1368  (72%)  were  randomized  and  received  allocated  treatment  (686 
rilpivirine versus 682 EFV). The reasons for screening failure (n = 527) were low baseline viral load (< 
5.000  copies/mL),  presence  of  at  least  NNRTI  RAM  or  having  risk  factors  for  QTc  prolongation  or 
laboratory toxicities.  
A  considerable  part  (165/1895;  8.7%=35%  of  screening  failures)  of  the  population  failed  inclusion 
because  of  baseline  viral  load  of  <  5,000  copies/ml,  and  the  applicant  was  asked  to  justify  this 
threshold (Q62). In their response, the applicant argued that this threshold was chosen to allow for a 
measureable decrease in viral load of ≥ 1.0 log10 copies/mL, given the detection limit of 50 copies/ml. 
This is considered acceptable.   
In the overall screened population with genotypic data, 156 (8.7%) out of 1,796 subjects had at least 
1  NNRTI  RAM  of  the  protocol  list.  To  what  extent  this  8.7%  primary  genotypic  resistance  implicates 
phenotypic  resistance  to  either  rilpivirine  or  EFV  is  unclear.  The  most  frequent  mutation  was  E138A 
that is associated with resistance to rilpivirine and not to EFV.  
Recruitment 
Primary analyses were performed when all subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment or 
discontinued earlier (cut-off date of 01 February 2010 for C209 and 28 January 2010 for C215). 
The final analysis of the two Phase III trials will be performed when all subjects have completed 
96 weeks of treatment, or discontinued earlier. 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic characteristics are the following: 
Table 10. 
The median age was 36 years (range 18-78), 76% were men. The number of patients aged above 65 
years was low (4 subjects).

The background regimens were:

About 9% of the included population had active hepatitis B or C infection, well balanced between the 
two treatment arms.  
The baseline disease characteristics are:

Dividing the CD4 T-cell count and viral load into different categories revealed the following: 
Figure 8. 
Figure 9. 
The median baseline CD4 T-cell count was around 250 cells/L. The proportion of subjects with CD4-
cell count ≥ 500 cells/L was low (4.1% and 6.7%, respectively).  
About  10%  of  the  randomized  population  had  a  CD4  T-cell  count  <50  cells/uL  and  5%  had  a  high 
baseline viral load above 500,000 copies/mL.

The distribution per region was follows: 
Table 13. 
The most notable differences in baseline characteristics between C209 and C215 were differences in 
region of origin (region 1 = western countries 55-60% versus 45-50%), gender (male sex 78-80% 
versus 72-73%) and HIV- 1 subtype (clade B ≈71% versus ≈68%).  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary objective was to establish non-inferiority in efficacy of rilpivirine vs. control with regard to 
the proportion of subjects achieving a confirmed viral load of < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of treatment, 
according to the TLOVR algorithm, with a maximum allowable difference of 12%. 
The proportion of subjects demonstrating virologic response was as follows:

Figure 10. 
Figure 11. 
The proportion of subjects that achieved a viral load < 50 copies/mL according to the TLOVR algorithm 
at Week 48 was similar between the rilpivirine group (84.3%) and the control group (82.3%). 
Statistical  comparison  using  a  logistic  regression  model  showed  a  predicted  difference  [95%  CI]  in 
virologic response (viral load < 50 copies/mL, TLOVR) at Week 48 between the pooled rilpivirine and 
control treatment groups of 1.6 [-2.2; 5.3] (p-value < 0.0001), demonstrating non-inferiority at both 
the 12% (primary endpoint) and 10% (secondary endpoint) margins. 
Superiority  of  rilpivirine  compared  to  control  was  not  established.  In  both  trials  C209  and  C215 
individually, there was no notable difference in response rate (< 50 copies/mL, TLOVR, ITT population) 
between the rilpivirine group and the control group (82.9% vs 82.8% in C209, and 85.6% vs 81.7% in 
C215, see Figure 10) and the primary endpoint of non-inferiority at the 12% margin was met in each 
trial independently. Based on the ITT and PP population, non-inferiority was also demonstrated at the 
10% margin in both trials.

The proportion of virologic responders seen in the control group in the Phase III trials was greater than 
or comparable to that seen for the same EFV-based combination ARTs in previous trials. In light of this 
and  the  non-inferiority  of  rilpivirine  to  control  established  in  the  Phase  III  trials,  the  efficacy  of 
rilpivirine  in  respect  of  the  proportion  of  virologic  responders  can  be  considered  comparable  to 
efavirenz. 
With respect to differences in response rates, the logistic regression model shown in the above figure 
was not adjusted for age, sex, CDC class category, HIV clade or baseline CD4 T-cell count. 
The  percentages  of  patients  with  treatment  failure  were  similar  between  rilpivirine  and  EFV  (13%  vs 
9%) but the reasons were different; for rilpivirine this predominantly was virological failure and for EFV 
adverse events (see table 14).

Both treatment groups showed a reconstitution of absolute and relative (%) CD4+ cell count at Week 
48.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  in  imputed  absolute  CD4+  cell  count  at  Week  48  was  192.1 
cells/μL; 95% CI [181.30;202.94] in the rilpivirine group and 176.2 cells/μL; 95% CI [164.63;187.76] 
in the control group.  
Subgroup analysis revealed that the efficacy of rilpivirine was comparable to EFV across gender, race, 
region of origin, HIV clade and background regimen.  
However,  though  the  subgroups  were  small,  there  was  a  trend  towards  lower  virological  efficacy  of 
rilpivirine compared to EFV for subjects with high viral load (>500.000 copies/mL; 70% vs 76%) and 
low CD4 T-cell count (< 50 cells/uL; 59% vs 81%) (see table 15).

The different backbones used were highly associated with region. Hence, comparing outcomes between 
for example zidovudine and tenofovir subsets will also include such large differences (social structures, 
adherence  etc).  However,  within  NRTI  subsets  (stratification  factor)  it  seems  reasonable  to  make 
comparisons, see table 16 below.

Outcomes in the tenofovir subsets of patients are of particular importance since this is by far the most 
commonly used first line NRTI backbone in EU. As seen above, the incidence of virological failure was 
more than twice as common with rilpivirine as with control in the tenofovir subset of patients but not 
for  the  other  NRTI  subsets.  However,  numbers  are  low  in  the  non-tdf  subsets,  and  should  be 
interpreted cautiously. 
The failure rate was driven by patients with a high baseline viral load as seen in the table 17 below.

These data show that efficacy was high for rilpivirine-treated patients with baseline VL<100,000 
copies/ml, but considerably lower in patients with baseline VL ≥ 100,000 copies/ml regardless of NRTI 
backbone used.  As a consequence of suboptimal virologic response when baseline viral load is high, 
the number of patients ending up with resistance is much higher for the rilpivirine-treated patients 
compared to the control group (discussed in the next section). Outcomes in patients with baseline viral 
load <100,000 copies/ml are comparable to that of the control group.

Failure and Resistance development  
Regardless  of  failure  population  looked  at  (those  with  protocol  defined  virological  failure,  and 
successfully  paried  genotypes  -  as  well  as  the  broader  population  of  all  patients  with  a  viral  load 
possible to genotype at time of failure), the absolute number of patients ending up with resistance was 
considerably higher for those treated with rilpivirine (2-3 fold higher for NNRTI-resistance, 3-4 for NRTI 
resistance), table 18 below.  
The table below shows the number of patients ending up with resistance by baseline viral load category 
for the overall population and the TDF subset.

The emerging NRTI RAMs are in the vast majority of cases resistance to cytidine analogues 
(emtricitabine/lamivudine). These drugs are important for the patient, with a low toxicity. 
Subsequently to selecting for a M184V/I mutation (i.e. resistance to FTC and 3TC), there will not be 
any obvious non-toxic dual NRTI backbone. Thus, 3TC/FTC resistance has more consequences as 
regards future therapy than just those related to cytidine analogue activity. 
The emerging NNRTI RAMs in patients failing with rilpivirine were associated with cross-resistance to 
all other NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine). In contrast, those failing efavirenz therapy and 
with emerging NNRTI RAMs would generally still be able to use etravirine. 
It  is  of  interest  comparing  resistance  outcomes  in  studies  C209/C215  with  those  of  studies  for  other 
first  line  agents.  The  amount  of  resistance  seen  in  patients  treated  with  rilpivirine  (in  this  example 
always combination with tenofovir/FTC) is high also in such a comparison, see table 19 below.

CHMP’s  table:  figures  from  ongoing  report,  Lancet  2009,  and  Reyataz  AR  respectively.  “Virological  failure”  not 
necessarily standardized between studies. 
Post-hoc analyses showed that the following factors increased chance of virologic response (in 
decreasing order of importance): 1. higher adherence, 2. higher rilpivirine exposure (C0h), 3. lower 
baseline viral load, 4. lower fold change in EC50 (FC) for rilpivirine at baseline, and higher baseline 
CD4+ cell count.  
Analyses of risk of virological failure and emerging resistance stratified by adherence indicate that risk 
of virologic failure was about twice as high in patients with less perfect adherence in both treatment 
arms. Still, risk of virologic failure in patients on rilpivirine with optimal adherence was higher than that 
in patients on efavirenz with low adherence, confirming that rilpivirine is indeed not a “forgiving agent” 
and adherence needs to be high. 
In conclusion, the data  indicate that, compared to EFV,  rilpivirine is associated with a 2-fold higher 
risk to develop NNRTI RAMs (10.5*64% = 6% absolute risk versus 5.7*54% = 3%) and a 3 to 4-fold 
higher risk to develop resistance to N(t)RTIs (10.5*63% = 6.6% absolute risk versus 5.7*32% = 
1.8%). Additional analyses stratified for baseline viral load confirm that this increased risk of emerging 
resistance is driven by patients with high baseline viral load which show lower virologic response rates 
and higher rates of virologic failure compared to control. For patients with baseline viral load <100,000 
copies/ml TCM278 shows comparable efficacy to EVF with low risk of emerging resistance and in the 
same order of magnitude as observed for EFV. Furthermore, in case of rilpivirine resistance, second 
line therapy with etravirine is no option due to cross-resistance whereas etravirine is still efficacious in 
case of EFV resistance.  
Summary of main studies 
The  following  tables  20  and  21  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the 
present  application.  These  summaries  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  discussion  on  clinical 
efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Table 20: Summary of Efficacy for trial TMC278-TiDP6-C209(ECHO study)  
Title:  A Phase III, randomized, double-blind trial of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus efavirenz 600 mg 
q.d. in combination with a fixed background regimen consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Study identifier 
TMC278-TiDP6-C209  
Design 
TMC278-TiDP6-C209 is an ongoing, 96-week, randomized, double-blind, double 
dummy, active-controlled, international Phase III trial in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected, treatment-naïve adult subjects. The 
trial was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. compared with efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg q.d. (control), each 
in combination with a background regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC).  
Adult subjects with an HIV-1 viral load of ≥ 5,000 HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
copies/mL, who were treatment-naïve, susceptible to their background regimen 
at screening, and had no non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
resistance associated mutations (RAMs) in their screening genotype, were 
eligible for the trial. 
Approximately 680 HIV-1 infected subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. or to EFV 600 mg q.d. The trial was designed to consist 
of a maximum screening period of 6 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, a post 
96-week treatment period (until all subjects in the trial who had not discontinued 
earlier had been treated for at least 96 weeks and the Week 96 database had 
been locked), followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

Design 
TMC278-TiDP6-C215 is an ongoing 96-week, randomized, double-blind, double-
dummy, active-controlled, international Phase III trial in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected, treatment-naïve adult subjects. The 
trial was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. compared with efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg q.d. (control). Each 
of these non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was given in 
combination with a background regimen containing two nucleoside/nucleotide 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). The investigator-selected N(t)RTIs 
were either abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT)/3TC, or tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC).  
Adult subjects with an HIV-1 viral load of ≥ 5000 HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
copies/mL, who were treatment-naïve, susceptible to their background regimen 
at screening, and had no NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in their 
screening genotype, were eligible for the trial. Approximately 680 HIV-1 infected 
subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. or to EFV 
600 mg q.d. after the investigator had selected the N(t)RTI background regimen.  
The trial was designed to consist of a maximum screening period of 6 weeks, a 
96 week treatment period, a post 96-week treatment period (until all subjects in 
the trial who had not discontinued earlier had been treated for at least 96 weeks 
and the Week 96 database had been locked), followed by a 4-week follow-up

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has performed one phase IIb study and two phase III studies.  
The phase IIb study was a dose-finding study.  
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 57/90
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on this study, initially a 75 mg q.d. dosage was chosen  for further development  as the 25 mg 
q.d.  formulation  was  associated  with  lower  exposure  and  a  trend  towards  lower  efficacy  especially 
among subjects with high baseline viral load. However, a dose-relationship could not be demonstrated. 
Later, when additional safety data became available suggesting a dose-safety relationship, the 25 mg 
q.d was selected for further evaluation in clinical studies.  
The  two  pivotal  phase  III  (C209  and  C215)  studies  are  ongoing  randomized,  double-blind,  double-
dummy, trials of rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. versus EFV 600 mg q.d. in combination with a fixed background 
regimen in ARV treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. The efficacy of rilpivirine for the treatment of 
HIV-1  infection  in  ARV  treatment-naïve  adult  patients  is  based  on  efficacy  data  of  the  Week  48 
analysis. The results of the Week 96 analysis are expected by 1Q2012. 
The chosen treatments are appropriate and EFV is the preferred NNRTI in first-line ARV regimens. Both 
trials do reflect daily clinical practice of a general relatively healthy population of HIV-1 individuals with 
an  indication  to  start  ARV  according  to  accepted  HIV  treatment  guidelines.  The  design  of  the  studies 
are similar and in accordance with the CHMP guideline (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02/Rev.1) for marketing 
authorisation application. 
With  respect  to  generalisability  of  the  trial  findings,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  studied  population 
consisted of ARV-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects, who had no NNRTI associated resistance mutations at 
baseline. However, few of these subjects had AIDS-defining or clinically significant coexisting illness, or 
CD4 T-cell counts below 50 cells/µL. Therefore, the results can not be extrapolated with to individuals 
with significant comorbidities. The median age was 36 years (range 18-78), 76% were male and 95% 
had a CDC category A or B stage of HIV infection. 
With respect to selection bias, the most relevant issue is the baseline screening for potential resistance 
as  this  might  not  be  a  routine  screening  tool  across  all  countries.  However,  according  to  European 
treatment guidelines, resistance testing is always recommended prior to starting HIV therapy. 
Up to 10% of the screened population indeed had NNRTI-associated mutations, which could lower the 
effect  of  rilpivirine  -  although  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  those  mutations  actually  would  lead  to 
treatment  failure.  About  3.3%  of  the  patients  would  have  been  excluded  based  on  the  currently 
selected list of mutations, the way these actually affect outcome is not known. Use of therapy should 
be  guided  by  resistance  testing  which  is  considered  current  good  clinical  practice  and  addressed  in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC. 
In  total  686  patients  were  randomized  to  rilpivirine  and  682  to  EFV.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  viral  loads  <50  copies/mL  at  48  weeks  in  an  ITT,  TLOVR  analysis.  Both 
groups had high rates of success at 48 weeks; 84.3% in the rilpivirine group versus 82.3% in the EFV 
group  meeting  the  non-inferiority  objective.  The  per  protocol  analysis  showed  similar  results.  The 
difference in response rate (rilpivirine versus EFV) was minus 0.4 (95% CI: minus 5.9 – 5.2) and 3.5 
(95% CI: minus 1.7 – 8.8) for the C209 and C215 trial respectively; both meeting the margins of non-
inferiority.  
The selected non-inferiority margin of 12% difference was chosen according to the FDA guideline while 
10% was recommended in a previous Scientific Advice. The observed CI is acceptable as it meets also 
the CHMP requested 10% delta value. 
The obtained response rates are comparable to previous trials with EFV used for first line ARV.  
Subgroup  analysis  demonstrated  that  rilpivirine  seems  to  be  less  efficacious  in  subjects  with  high 
baseline  viral  load  or  low  CD4  T-cell  count.  For  subjects  with  a  viral  load  >  100.000  -  ≤  500.000 
copies/mL the virologic response at week 48 was 79.5% vs 82.6% and for subjects with a viral load > 
500.000  copies/mL  this  was  69.6%  vs  75.6%  (n  =  69  vs  n  =  89)  for  TMC78  and  EFV  recipients 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 58/90
Rev06.11 
 
 
 
respectively.  For  subjects  with  CD4+  T-cells  <50  cells/uL  (n  =  34  versus  n  =  36)  the  response  rate 
was  58.8%  vs  80.6%.  Definite  conclusions  of  inferiority  of  rilpivirine  for  these  subgroups  can  not  be 
made  due  to  limited  sample  size  but  the  possible  lower  efficacy  is  of  concern.  There  were  no 
differences in efficacy across subgroups with respect to gender, age, region, HIV clade or background 
regimen.  
In addition to this it is of special interest to know the virological efficacy among the different strata of 
adherence  as  non-adherence  is  associated  with  virological  failure.  Post-hoc  analyses  showed  that 
virologic  response  rates  were  about  20%  lower  in  patients  with  less  perfect  adherence  compared  to 
patients  with  optimal  adherence  whereas  the  proportion  of  virologic  failures  roughly  doubled  in  this 
group  for  both  treatment  arms.  However,  since  there  appears  to  be  an  efficacy  problem  per  se  with 
rilpivirine,  the  risk  for  virological  failure  was  actually  lower  with  efavirenz  taken  with  low  adherence, 
than with rilpivirine taken with optimal adherence. Therefore, rilpivirine appears not to be a “forgiving 
agent” and adherence needs to be very high. 
The rilpivirine group had a lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs (2% versus 7%), but the EFV group 
had  a  lower  rate  of  virological  failure  (10.5%  versus  5.7%,  4.7%  versus  1.8%  leading  to 
discontinuation).  Among  the  subjects  with  virological  failure,  NNRTI  resistance  mutations  emerged  in 
63%  of  the  rilpivirine  recipients  (most  commonly  E138K  leading  to  cross-resistance  to  etravirine) 
versus  54%  of  the  EFV  recipients  (most  commonly  K103N)  and  resistance  to  NRTIs  emerged  in  68% 
versus 32%, respectively.  
Thus,  rilpivirine  is  associated  with  a  two-fold  higher  absolute  risk  than  EFV  for  the  development  of 
resistance  associated  mutations  and,  moreover,  in  case  of  emergent  resistance  mutations  the  clinical 
impact is greater leaving fewer alternatives for sensitive second line ARVs. 
Post-hoc multivariate analyses showed that the following factors increase chance of virologic response 
(in decreasing order of importance): 1. higher adherence, 2. higher rilpivirine exposure (C0h), 3. lower 
baseline  viral  load,  4.  lower  fold  change  in  EC50  (FC)  for  rilpivirine  at  baseline,  and  higher  baseline 
CD4+  cell  count.  From  a  labelling  point  of  view,  baseline  viral  load  and  CD4  count  are  the  only 
parameters  that  can  be  affected.  rilpivirine  is  approvable  provided  the  indication  is  restricted  to 
patients  with  low  baseline  viral  load  ≤  100,000  copies/ml.  Although  response  rate  appears  lower  in 
patients  with  low  baseline  viral  load  and  CD4  count  <  50  cells/ul,  numbers  are  too  low  to  draw 
conclusions on the impact of low CD4 count. 
The 25 mg dose appeared suboptimal in terms of efficacy (lower virologic response) for the population 
in  general.  Whereas  there  appeared  no  dose-relationship  in  terms  of  virologic  response  (phase  2b), 
lower AUC tended towards a lower response within the phase 3 studies using population PK. Hence, the 
exposure achieved with the 25 mg dose is just at the edge, or slightly below the Emax of RPV - which 
gives efficacy problems mainly in patients with a high baseline viral load. The applicant does not have 
the intention to continue to develop the 50 mg dose due to the safety concerns. 
Any  concomitant  drugs  that  would  lower  the  rilpivirine  exposure,  as  well  as  intake  in  fasted  state,  is 
likely related to a risk of lower efficacy, and the development of resistance. It is crucial that the need 
for correct intake (fed state) and the risk associated with certain interacting drugs is emphasized in the 
SmPC  (contraindication).  However,  the  latter  restrictions  might  be  difficult  to  handle  in  clinical  and 
daily  practice,  with  the  potential  risk  of  lower  virologic  response  and  emergence  of  resistance.  The 
applicant was requested to perform a drug utilisation study to evaluate how the drug is used in clinical 
practice (see corresponding measure in the RMP) and subsequent PSURs. 
It remains to be seen whether an increased dose of this order would make a substantial difference in 
the  numbers  of  virological  failure  in  those  patients  with  a  high  baseline  viral  load;  although  the  low 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev06.11 
Page 59/90
 
 
 
potency of rilpivirine might be the main obstacle with regards the risk of resistance development (1.2 
log10 reduction in monotherapy, regardless of dose used).  
In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken  with  more  potent  drugs,  especially  for  patients  who  do  not  tolerate  efavirenz.  Although  the 
drug might be an effective option, there is currently no data available in support of such use. Such use 
should  be  monitored  in  clinical  practice  and  new  studies  on  use  in  patients  switching  from  other 
therapies  to  RPV  (See  corresponding  measures  in  the  RMP).  In  addition  to  this,  the  applicant  will 
perform  a  drug  interaction  study  with  efavirenz  and  50  mg  rilpivirine  dose  as  metabolic  induction  by 
efavirenz holds for quite some time (See corresponding measures in the RMP). This study is aimed to 
investigate  the  concerns  that  further  lowering  exposure  of  the  25  mg  dose  rilpivirine  might  increase 
the risk of virological failure.  
Furthermore, the available limited data upon individuals with high viral load, do suggest that rilpivirine 
is less virological efficacious than EFV. Together with the previous noted higher risk for development of 
resistance special caution should be warranted for rilpivirine use in such individuals. The concern that 
rilpivirine is less virological efficacious than EFV in patients with high viral load was further confirmed 
by  the  post-hoc  analyses  stratified  for  baseline  viral  load.  Overall  the  lower  virologic  response,  the 
higher number of patients with virologic failure and the 3 times increased risk of emerging resistance 
compared  with  EFV,  precludes  use  of  rilpivirine  in  the  patient  population  with  baseline  viral  load 
>100,000 copies/ml).  
The  impact  of  the  above  addressed  concerns  will  likely  become  clearer  once  the  96-weeks  become 
available  (see  corresponding  sections of  the  RMP).  Thus  these  96-week  data  are  required  for  definite 
assessment of the benefits and risks.  
A bioequivalent study showed equivalence between the fixed dose combination tablet and the free 
combination of the individual mono-components. Since efficacy and safety have been established with 
the monocomponents the results are considered also applicable for the combination product.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on two pivotal phase III studies, it can be concluded that rilpivirine is non-inferior to the golden 
standard comparator EFV for treatment of ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals.  
However, to generalise the conclusion to subjects with baseline low CD4 counts and high viral load is 
disputable.  Furthermore,  the  higher  rate  of  virological  failure  and  the  development  of  resistance 
associated  mutations  is  a  major  concern,  especially  as  this  hampers  available  second  line  treatment 
options.  
Post-hoc  analyses  confirmed  that  the  observed  increased  risk  of  emerging  resistance  with  TCM278  is 
driven by patients with high baseline viral load; these patients show lower virologic response rates and 
higher  rates  of  virologic  failure  compared  to  EFV.  On  the  other  hand,  for  patients  with  baseline  viral 
load  ≤100,000  copies/ml  TCM278  shows  comparable  efficacy  to  EVF  with  low  risk  of  emerging 
resistance and in the same order of magnitude as observed for EFV. Therefore, rilpivirine is approvable 
for a restricted indication to patients with low baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml. Interaction with 
drugs that could lower TCM278 exposure should be contraindicated as this might lead to a potentially 
lower  response  and  increased  risk  of  resistance  with  a  possible  loss  of  treatment  options  and  the 
product must be taken with a meal.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary in the risk management plan to address issues 
related to efficacy: 
-To provide the 96 weeks clinical study report of study C209 and C215 by 1Q 2012 
-To submit the results of the ongoing switch studies GS-US-264-0111 by 1Q 2013 and GS-US-264-
0106 by 4Q 2012 
Additionally the CHMP recommended the applicant to submit the experiments planned for assessing 
outcomes with rilpivirine in combination with zidovudine and abacavir (to be compared to the results in 
the Gilead PC-264-2003 study).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
There  were  6  trials  in  HIV-1  infected  subjects.  1  phase  I,  2  phase  IIa  trials,  1  phase  IIb  trial  and  2 
phase  III  trials.  All  studies  except  study  phase  I  and  phase  IIa  C202  were  conducted  in  treatment 
naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. In total 1052 HIV-infected subjects of which 1001 treatment naïve HIV-
1 infected subjects were exposed to rilpivirine. In addition 660 non-HIV infected subjects were exposed 
to rilpivirine in phase I studies.  
The number of treatment naive HIV-1 infected subjects treated with at least 25 mg rilpivirine is 1001, 
611  of  these  subjects  were  included  in  the  phase  III  studies.  This  number  is  sufficient  to  explore 
adverse events which occur with a frequency of approximately 1%. The proposed dose of 25 mg q.d. 
was given in the phase III studies. The Phase IIb  study was a dose-finding study with 25, 75 or 150 
mg  rilpivirine  q.d.  More  than  84%  of  the  subjects  from  the  phase  IIb  and  phase  III  studies  were 
treated  for  at  least  48  weeks.  This  is  in  line  with HIV  guideline  that  safety  data  of  at  least  48  weeks 
treatment should be submitted.  
The  safety  assessment  is  based  on  pooled  data  from  1,368  patients  in  the  Phase  III  controlled  trials 
TMC278  C209  (ECHO)  and  TMC278  C215  (THRIVE)  in  antiretroviral  treatment  naïve  HIV  1  infected 
adult patients, 686 of whom received rilpivirine 25 mg once daily. The median duration of exposure for 
patients in the rilpivirine arm and efavirenz arm was 55.7 and 55.6 weeks, respectively. 
Based  on  non-clinical  and  early  clinical  findings  QTc  interval  and  adrenal  function  effects  were  given 
particular attention in clinical trials. In addition special attention was given to skin events, neurologic 
events, psychiatric events and hepatic event. 
Adverse events  
Phase I 
Overall,  rilpivirine  appeared  to  be  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated.  The  main  finding  in  the  phase  I 
studies was the dose-dependent increase in QTcF interval observed in study C131 at doses of 75 mg 
q.d. and 300 mg q.d. This finding led to the selection of the 25 mg q.d. for further development. 
Phase III 
Based upon the week 48 analyses of the pooled phase III studies any treatment related adverse event 
occurred  less  frequent  in  the  rilpivirine  group  compared  to  control  (46.4%  versus  64.1%)  For  any 
treatment AE at least grade 2 this was 15.9% versus 31.1%, indicating that in both groups most of the 
treatment  related  adverse  events  were  mild.  This  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  the  differences  in 
treatment related AEs which occurred within the first four weeks of treatment.

See figure 12 below. 
Figure 12 
At week four the incidence of adverse events in the rilpivirine group is approximately 35%, while it is 
approximately 55% in the control group. When treatment continues the differences become less. 
This picture is seen for all treatment related adverse events but also for the individual adverse events 
like skin events (rash) and neurological events. 
By  SOC,  the  most  observed  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  rilpivirine  group  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders (19.2% on rilpivirine vs 17.7% on control), nervous system disorders (17.2% on rilpivirine vs 
36.7% on control), psychiatric disorders (14.9% vs 22.7%) skin and subcutaneous disorders (7.0% vs 
16.1%). By preferred term, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the rilpivirine group 
were  nausea  (10.1%  vs  11.3%  on  control),  dizziness  (8.0%  vs  26.2%  on  control),  abnormal  dreams 
(6.3% vs 9.4% on control) and headache (6.1% vs 6.2% on control). Dizziness and rash (2.5% versus 
8.9%) occurred significantly more often in the control group (see table 22 below).

Table  22:  Adverse  Events  at  Least  Possibly  Related  to  rilpivirine/Control  in  at  Least  2%  of 
Subjects  (by  System  Organ  Class  or  Preferred  Term)  in  the  rilpivirine  or  Control  Group 
(Phase III Week 48 Pooled Analysis) 
With  regard  to  grade  3  or  more  AE,  these  were  observed  in  13.3%  of  the  rilpivirine  group  versus 
18.0% in the control group. The most reported grade 3 or 4 events in the rilpivirine group were AST 
increased  (1.0% vs 1.2% on control), blood amylase increased (1.0% vs 1.0% on control), neutrophil 
count decreased (1.0% vs 1.8% on control) and neutropenia (1.0% vs 1.0% on control).None of these 
AEs were considered at least possibly related to treatment. 
The  overall  AE  profile  was  similar  in  the  Phase  IIb  and  Phase  III  trials,  except  for  grade  3  or  4  AEs 
which were reported more frequently in the Phase IIb trial (25.8% for 25 mg q.d. and 24.7 % for all 
rilpivirine) than in the pooled Phase III trials (13.3%) with rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. 
For the Phase IIb study there were also safety analyses at week 96 and at week 192. 
At week 96 there was no dose relationship in the overall incidence of AEs reported in the 3 rilpivirine 
dose groups. Although there appeared to be a trend towards a higher discontinuation rate due to AEs 
with  increasing  dose,  there  is  no  specific  SOC  or  preferred  term  level  which  contributes  to  this 
phenomenon.  A  dose  trend  was  observed  in  the  incidence  of  the  skin  event  of  interest,  the  grouped 
term  “rash”,  which  increased  in  incidence  with  increasing  rilpivirine  dose  (5.4%,  9.5%  and  13.2% 
versus 21.3% for control).

Adverse events of special interest 
Effects on QTc 
In phase I studies the dose-dependent increase in QTcF interval observed in study C131 at doses of 75 
mg q.d. and 300 mg q.d led to the selection of the 25 mg q.d. for further development. 
In  phase  II  studies  at  week  192  the  main  observation  was  that  following  the  gradual  mean  increase 
from  baseline  in  QTcF  up  to  week  48,  this  interval  remained  stable  up  to  week  144,  but  showed  a 
further increase thereafter. 
Mean  increases  in  QTcF  interval  after  Week  96  continued  to  be  more  pronounced  in  subjects  treated 
with AZT/3TC compared with those treated with TDF/FTC, regardless of treatment group (rilpivirine or 
control), with greater increases in QTcF interval observed for females than for males.

Overall,  similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  the  combined  rilpivirine  and  control  groups  had  a  QTcF 
interval abnormality, an abnormal increase in QTcF interval during the trial, or an abnormal increase in 
QTcF interval that resulted in an abnormal QTcF value. No pattern was observed at the different time 
points  in  the  number  of  subjects  with  increases  in  QTcF  interval  of  >  60  ms,  and  only  a  small 
proportion  of  subjects  with  an  abnormal  increase  in  QTcF  interval  had  an  abnormal  actual  value. 
Therefore,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  obtained  QT-prolongation  at  a  dose  of  75  mg  is  currently 
unclear. 
in phase 3 studies the ECG data were included in 5 planned subgroup analyses: by background N(t)RTI 
regimen, by gender, by race, by race-by-gender, and by co-medication with a potential impact on QT 
interval. 
Overall there was an increase over time in the mean QTcF interval in both rilpivirine and control groups. 
The  increase  was  gradual  and  numerically  higher  in  the  control  group.  The  mean  maximum  change 
from  baseline  in  QTcF  interval  in  the  overall  population  was  +17.9  ms  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and 
+19.2 ms in the control group.  
A  summary  of  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ECG  abnormalities  (worst  abnormality)  is 
presented in the table 24 below. 
Table 24: Treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities (phase III week 48 pooled analysis) 
There were no clinically relevant differences between the rilpivirine and control groups in the incidence 
of treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities overall. In both treatment groups, the most frequent (in at 
least 2.0% of rilpivirine-treated subjects) treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities were abnormally low 
HR (8.0% with rilpivirine vs 4.7% in the control group), QTcB interval > 450 ms (6.3% vs 9.0%), and 
abnormal  increases  in  QTcF  and  QTcB  interval  (QTcF:  19.8%  vs  20.9%,  QTcB:  27.3%  vs  32.7%). 
Abnormalities in the QRS and PR intervals were infrequent in both treatment groups. 
The QTcF interval increase was lower in the TDF/FTC subgroup than in the AZT/3TC subgroup, with a 
QTcF  interval  increase  at  Week  48  of  +10.6  ms  and  +12.1  ms  in  the  rilpivirine  group  and  +12.1  ms

and +17.8 ms and in the control group, respectively. No differences were found for gender and race or 
co medication. 
Subjects with pre-existing risk factors for QTc prolongation were excluded in the phase III trials. Post-
hoc analyses showed that about 3% of the screened subjects failed screening for this reason. The most 
frequently  reported  ECG  finding  was  incomplete  right  bundle  branch  block  occurring  in  28  subjects, 
followed  by  complete  right  bundle  branch  block  in  seven  subjects.  Given  the  low  incidence  at 
screening,  the  fact  that  the  most  frequently  observed  ECG  finding  is  of  limited  clinical  relevance  and 
the  fact  that  the  25  mg  dose  was  not  associated  with  QT  interval  prolongation,  there  is  no  need  to 
screen with ECG before starting treatment with rilpivirine.  
Adverse events of special interest for an NNRTI 
Skin  events  (rash),  neurological  events  (headache,  dizziness  and  somnolence)  and  psychiatric  events 
(insomnia,  abnormal  dreams  and  depression)  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  first  four  weeks  of 
treatment with a lower incidence of events in the rilpivirine group compared to control. After the first 
four weeks the incidence decreased but remained somewhat lower for the rilpivirine group compared to 
control.  
The  incidence  of  hepatic  events  of  interest  was  low  in  the  pooled  Phase  III  trials  (2.2%  out  of  5.5% 
were  considered  treatment  related  in  the  rilpivirine  groups  versus  2.1%  out  of  6.6%  in  the  control 
groups). 
With regard to hepatic events (AST, ALT) incidence seems to be comparable between the two groups; 
also  for  this  kind  of  adverse  events  the  occurrence  is  somewhat  higher  in  the  first  four  weeks  but 
overall low. 
With  regard  to  the  adverse  events  of  special interest,  the  safety  profile  of  rilpivirine  appears  to  be  in 
favour compared to the safety profile of the control (efavirenz). 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
In  total  there  were  9  deaths,  all  were  considered  not  related  to  the  study  medication.  Five  subjects 
died (with 6 AEs leading to death) during the course of the 2 Phase III trials, 1 in the rilpivirine group 
in  trial  C215  and  4  in  the  control  group  (1  in  trial  C209  and  3  in  trial  C215).  Causes  of  death  were 
bronchopneumonia  for  the  subject  on  rilpivirine  and  Burktt’s  lymphoma,  cerebral  toxoplasmosis  and 
respiratory  failure,  dysentery,  cerebrovascular  accident  for  the  4  subjects  in  control  group.  In  the 
phase IIb study up to week 192 in total four subjects died. Up to the week 96 analysis of the phase IIb 
study  it  is  described  that  one  subject  died  in  a  car  accident  and  another  died  of  cardio-respiratory 
arrest both  were on rilpivirine 75 mg. After the week 96 analysis two subjects died. One of unknown 
cause, the other died from acute infarction of the intestines following multiple drug intoxication. 
Overall, 45 subjects (6.6%) in the rilpivirine group and 55 subjects (8.1%) in the control group had at 
least  1  SAE  during  the  treatment  period.  The  highest  incidence  of  Seas  was  in  the  SOC  of  infections 
and  infestations  (2.6%  for  rilpivirine  versus  2.5%  versus  control).  The  only  notable  difference  was 
seen in the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders (0.9% on rilpivirine vs 0.1% on control). 
Most  SAEs  were  considered  not  related  to  treatment.  Seven  subjects  (1.0%)  in  the  rilpivirine  group 
and  6  subjects  (0.9%)  in  the  control  group  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-related  SAE.  Thus  no 
difference  between  the  two  groups,  also  psychiatric  disorders  (0.4%  versus  0.3%),  skin  disorders 
Eviplera 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 66/90

(0.1% versus 0.1%) and nervous system disorders (0.1% versus 0.1%) were comparable between the 
two groups.  
Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent graded laboratory abnormalities of at least grade 2 
in  the  rilpivirine  group  were  hypophosphatemia  (9.1%),  increased  pancreatic  amylase  (6.1%), 
hyperglycemia  (5.4%),  and  elevated  LDL  cholesterol  (5.5%).  There  were  no  apparent  differences 
between  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  of  at  least  grade  2  hypophosphatemia,  increased 
pancreatic amylase or hyperglycemia. 
With  regard  to  haemoglobin,  hepatic  parameters  (ALT,  AST)  and    pancreatic  parameters  (amylase, 
lipase) overall the pattern between TMC 278 and control appear comparable. 
Adrenal hormones 
Effects on adrenal glands were seen preclinically in all species except rabbits. This is considered to be 
related to partial inhibition of the CYP21 enzyme - which catalyzes major steps in the aldosterone and 
cortisol pathways, figure below. 
Figure. 14. 
Therefore  basal  cortisol,  17-OH-progesterone,  aldosterone, androstenedione,  DHEAS,  progesterone 
and testosterone were monitored in both phase 2b and phase 3. In addition an ACTH stimulation test 
was also performed at baseline, at Week 48, and at unscheduled visits if based on basal cortisol results 
or an abnormal ACTH test.  
In study C204 cortisol levels of ≥ 550 nmol/ at least at one of the 3 time points (i.e., morning cortisol, 
30  or  60  minutes  after  250  μg  ACTH  stimulation)  on  the  screening  assessment  was  an  inclusion 
criterion. However, in phase 3 there were no such restrictions. 
Changes  of  adrenal  hormones  in  the  phase  3  study  (rilpivirine  dosed  25  mg)  were  small,  and  varied 
inconsistently between treatments. In study C204 25mg, 75 mg, 150 mg), there was a tendency for a 
slightly lower cortisol response to ACTH-stimuli in patients with the higher TMC-doses (table 25 below), 
while morning values were not affected. No clinical symptoms related to cortisol deficiency were noted.

performed on each individual delta. 
No significant changes were seen in levels of androstenedione, progesterone, testosterone and LH. 
Likewise, not symptoms related to impaired levels of these hormones were reported to occur.  
Renal parameters 
In  patients  treated  with  rilpivirine  there  was  an  immediate  increase  of  serum  creatinine  -  causing  a 
decrease in calculated clearance, not seen with the control regimen. In the phase 3 studies (25 mg), 
this decrease in clearance was more pronounced with tenofovir (left) than with zidovudine (right).  
Figure 15. Change in calculated creatine clearance in studies C209 + C215 pooled. 
Left: tenofovir/FTC subset;  right: zidovudine/3TC subset 
In  the  tenofovir  subset  of  patient  in  study  C204  (3  doses  of  rilpivirine),  this  change  in  creatinine 
clearance seen with rilpivirine was, however, not dose dependent (data shown in Clinical report). 
The  immediate  change  in  creatinine  clearance  is  likely  to  be  caused  by  an  inhibition  of  creatinine 
secretion  on  the  tubular  level.  In  contrast,  cystatin  C  is  freely  filtered by  the  glomeruli  without  any

proximal tubular secretion. Therefore, also cystatin clearance was calculated in study C215 - where the 
different  NRTI  back  bones  made  this  analysis  more  interesting.  Although,  increases  of  cystatin 
clearance was seen from baseline to week 48 for all dose groups (an effect of controlling HIV-infection), 
smaller increases were obtained in rilpivirine-treated patients regardless of NRTI backbone used.  Also 
a lower increase, not only a decrease, could be indicative of a slight renal toxicity.  
Considering the pre-clinical data (kidney target organ) and renal effects seen in patients, it is clear that 
long  term  renal  toxicity  should  be  monitored  also  with  parameters  adequate  for  determining  tubular 
dysfunction.  
It  is  of  particular  interest  to  see  such  data  by  tenofovir  and  non-tenofovir  subsets  for  both  rilpivirine 
and control; as tenofovir per se carries a, dose dependent, risk for that kind of toxicity. It is important 
to  verify  that  rilpivirine  and  tenofovir  given  in  combination,  does  not  give  an  additive/synergistic  risk 
for the tubular toxicity already described for tenofovir, which in turn causes phosphate loss with bone 
loss as perhaps the most important outcome measure. Such data was requested as part of the primary 
LoQ  (urine-protein,  urine-β2-microglobulin  etc).    For  the  issue  of  possible  tubular  toxicity,  DEXA-
scanning  for  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  is  of  major  interest,  particularly  comparing  the  tenofovir 
subsets of rilpivirine treated vs control, for reasons outlined above.  
To  be  noted,  long  term  bone  safety  with  tenofovir  was  only  shown  for  tenofovir  in  combination  with 
efavirenz - in practice as Atripla, which given in a fasted state. It is therefore a concern that, based on 
the  data  presented  the  tenofovir  exposure  is  increased  around  50%  compared  to  the  Atripla 
combination, when given with rilpivirine (+25%) and food (+25%) (rilpivirine needs to be taken with 
food). 
The  phase  3  studies  included  an  optional  DEXA  sub  study  looking  at  BMD  progress  from  baseline  to 
weeks 48 and 96.  
The applicant could not provide additional safety data on parameters adequate for monitoring tubular 
injury,  as  these  were  not  collected  during  the  studies.  However,  other  available  data  do  not  point 
toward  tubular  toxicity  with  rilpivirine.  There  was  no  difference  in  bone  parameters  in  the  DEXA 
substudy  for  rilpivirine  and  EFV,  regardless  of  NRTI  backbone.  Also,  rates  of  hypophosphatemia  were 
quite the same between treatment arms.  
Given the fact that tenofovir exposure is highly dependent on renal clearance the effect of rilpivirine on 
renal clearance and creatinine levels should however be reflected in the SmPC, as well that rilpivirine 
was only studied in patients with normal renal function.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The company describes a methodology used to identify Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). The first step 
was  the  generation  of  a  list  of  preferred  terms  to  be  considered  as  potential  ADRs,  the  second  step 
(review  of  individual  and  multiple  cases)  to  generate  a  draft  ADR  list  and  finally  this  draft  list  was 
discussed  in  a  broader  group  leading  to  the  Final  ADR  list.  In  some  cases,  MedDRA  preferred  terms 
related to a common pathology or symptom were grouped to a single common preferred term. These 
are  called  ‘grouped  terms’  and  were  assigned  to  the  primary  SOC  associated  with  the  preferred  term 
which  corresponds  to  the  term  used  as  an  ADR  grouped  term.  This  methodology  was  considered 
appropriate.  
All ADRs of at least grade 2 identified from the Phase III pooled database are listed in the table 26.

Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Co-infection 
In  the  Phase  III  pooled  analysis,  approximately  9%  of  subjects  were  reported  to  be  co-infected  with 
hepatitis  B  and/or  C  at  baseline  or  on-treatment.  As  expected,  in  both  treatment  groups,  elevated 
hepatic  parameters  were  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  in  subjects  who  were  co-infected  with 
hepatitis  B  and/or  C  than in  subjects who  were  not co-infected.  The incidence  in  co-infected  subjects 
was comparable in both the rilpivirine and control groups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase III: Overall, 23 subjects (3.4%) in the rilpivirine group and 52 subjects (7.6%) in the control 
group had at least 1 AE leading to discontinuation. Psychiatric disorders (1.5% vs 2.2% on control) 
were the most frequent. rilpivirine-treated subjects who discontinued because of AEs did so later than 
subjects in the control group and this difference was sustained throughout the treatment period. 
Overall the discontinuation rate due to AEs was 2.2% the rilpivirine group versus 7.2% on the control.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
TMC  278  appeared  to  be  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated.    The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-
related AEs in the rilpivirine group were nausea, dizziness, abnormal dreams and headache. Especially 
within the first four weeks of treatment rilpivirine the safety profile of TMC seemed in favor compared 
to  control.  After  the  first  four  weeks  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events  decreased  but  there  remained 
somewhat difference in safety profile in favor of TMC although to a lesser extend. 
With regards to AEs frequently discussed for approved NNRTIs Neurological AEs often experienced 
during the first weeks of treatment for the preferred NNRTI efavirenz (control), was less frequently 
seen with rilpivirine. Psychiatric AEs, often discussed as a problem with efavirenz, were rather 
uncommon for both regimens; anxiety and abnormal dreams were somewhat more common with 
control, while depression was slightly more frequently reported in rilpivirine treated patients.  Rash, 
commonly seen with efavirenz (but only causing 1 patient from each treatment arm to permanently 
stop therapy in phase 3), was less frequent with rilpivirine. However, dermatitis/eczema appearing 
later during treatment was more common. Lipid parameters are not significantly affected by rilpivirine. 
Hepatic events were uncommon and mild for both treatments, Three subjects had grade 4 hepatic 
events of while on rilpivirine, none of which were reported as SAEs. Those 3 patients all had hepatitis 
co-infection. 
Renal function was lowered with rilpivirine compared to control, regardless if using creatinine (lowered 
from baseline value) or cystatin C (somewhat less improvement from baseline vs control) as the 
parameter used to calculate GFR. This did not seem to be dose related when looking at the phase 2 b 
study (cystatin C data only presented for the 25 mg dose). Since kidney was a target organ in rats and 
dogs, primarily with tubular toxicity the company was asked to provide safety data on parameters 
adequate for tubular injury. This is particularly important having in mind that rilpivirine is used in 
combination with tenofovir; an agent with well known risk for tubular toxicity. Post-hoc analyses 
provided did not point toward tubular toxicity with rilpivirine. There was no difference in bone 
parameters in the DEXA substudy for rilpivirine and EFV, regardless of NRTI backbone, and rates of 
hypophosphatemia were similar between treatment arms. These data are therefore reassuring. The 
effect of rilpivirine on renal clearance and creatinine levels is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC, as well as that rilpivirine was only studied in patients with normal renal function.

Due to QT results, during the phase 2b study, the dose for further development was lowered from 75 
mg q.d. to 25 mg q.d.. The clinical relevance of the QT-prolongation seen with 75 mg is currently not 
clear. Long term safety in this regard is of interest. Although the 25 mg q.d. does not show QT 
prolongation, a warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that QT prolongation was observed at 
doses of 75 mg q.d. 
Inhibition of adrenal hormone-axis does not seem to be a relevant issue for rilpivirine dosed 25 mg 
q.d. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The safety conclusions are further discussed in the context of the overall benefit-
risk balance.

creatinine clearance decrease to < 50 mL/min 
in any patient receiving Eviplera. 
Section 4.5 of the Eviplera SmPC:  
  An interaction statement that FTC and TDF 
are primarily eliminated by the kidneys and 
therefore co-administration of Eviplera with 
medicinal products that reduce renal function 
or compete for active tubular secretion may 
increase serum concentrations of FTC/TDF 
and/or the co-administered products.

Section 4.4 of the Eviplera SmPC: 
  Statement that in HIV infected patients from a 
144-week controlled clinical study that 
compared TDF with stavudine in combination 
with lamivudine and efavirenz in 
antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases 
in bone mineral density of the hip and spine 
were observed in both treatment groups. 
Decreases in bone mineral density of spine 
and changes in bone biomarkers from 
baseline were significantly greater in the TDF 
treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in 
bone mineral density of hip were significantly 
greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, 
there was no increased risk of fractures or 
evidence for clinically relevant bone 
abnormalities over 144 weeks. 
  Warning that bone abnormalities (infrequently 
contributing to fractures) may be associated 
with proximal renal tubulopathy and that if 
bone abnormalities are suspected then 
appropriate consultation should be obtained.

Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the Eviplera SmPC: 
  Statement that there is limited information 
regarding the use of Eviplera in patients with 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-

  Statement indicating that limited data from 
clinical studies support once daily dosing of 
Eviplera in patients with mild renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 
mL/min). 
  Statement that long-term safety data for the 
FTC and TDF components of Eviplera have not 
been evaluated in patients with mild renal 
impairment, therefore, in patients with mild 
renal impairment Eviplera should only be used 
if the potential benefits of treatment are 
considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
  Statement indicating that the Eviplera is not 
recommended for patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 50 mL/min) as this patient population 
requires dose interval adjustment of FTC and

The Applicant provided a protocol for a drug utilisation study (DUS) implicating the use of the already 
existing European HIV cohorts: Observational Cohort Study Including a Nested Case-Control Study to 
Assess Rilpivirine (RPV) Utilization According to the European SmPC. 
The  development  of  resistance  and  the  utilization  of  RPV-containing  products  according  to  the 
products’  SmPC  will  be  assessed  through  a  drug  utilization  study  (DUS)  conducted  in  existing  HIV 
observational cohorts within Europe. Additionally, the DUS will provide context to the observed rates of 
virologic failure and development of resistance for patients initiating RPV treatment by describing the 
treatment  outcomes  of  patients  initiating  efavirenz  (EFV).  The  relative  risk  of  virologic  failure  and 
resistant-associated  mutations  (RAMs)  after  initiating  RPV-containing  regimens  will  be  estimated 
separately by comparing the incidence rates of virologic failure and RAMs among RPV-treated patients 
to  the  incidence  of  virologic  failure  and  RAMs  among  EFV-treated  patients.  For  all  study  objectives, 
frequency and rates will be reported for the RPV and EFV-treated groups separately, as well as for RPV 
relative to EFV.  
A  minimum  of  600  HIV-positive  patients  are  to  be  included.  Additionally,  a  comparator  cohort  of  a 
minimum of 600 EFV-treated patients will be included.   
A  nested  case-control  study  will  be  conducted  to  assess  the  effects  of  ARV  treatment  adherence  and

Primary objectives include: to describe the proportion of patients treated with RPV in accordance with 
the  SmPC,  to  describe  treatment  emergent  RAMs  in  patients  treated  with  RPV  or  EFV-containing 
regimens and to describe virologic failure in patients treated with RPV or EFV-containing regimens. 
The final protocol of the DUS study, including the nested case control study protocol, is agreed by the 
CHMP. The Applicant should report on this study as well in the PSURs and the RMP updates. 
USA a cohort study in women 
In the USA a cohort study in women will be conducted, which will provide additional data on the use of 
rilpivirine-containing regimens for treatment of HIV-infected women, in everyday clinical practice. The 
primary objective of this cohort study is to characterize the population and treatment outcomes of 
ARV-naïve women (including switches) in routine clinical practice initiating rilpivirine-containing 
regimens. The Applicant has submitted the protocol of this study. The Applicant should report on this 
study as well in the PSURs and the RMP updates. 
Switch studies GS-US-264-011 and GS-US-264-0106 
The two ongoing Gilead FDC switch studies are: 
A Phase III randomized, open-label study to evaluate switching from regimens consisting of a 
ritonavir-boosted PI and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to FTC/rilpivirine/TDF 
fixed-dose regimen in virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 infected patients (study GS-US-264-0106) 
A Phase IIb open-label pilot study to evaluate switching from a regimen consisting of an EFV/FTC/TDF 
single tablet regimen to FTC/rilpivirine/TDF single tablet regimen in virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 
infected subjects (study GS-US-264-0111) 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The fixed dose combination tablet combining tenofovir, emtricitabine and rilpivirine is the second ARV 
regimen containing one tablet once daily for treatment of HIV-1 in adults (the targeted indication). RPV 
is a new agent and the fourth representative of the Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor 
(NNRTI) after nevirapine, efavirenz (EFV) and etravirine. As RPV is a new ARV, this assessment 
primarily focuses on the benefit-risk balance of this new agent in combination with TDF and FTC. 
As bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the FDC tablet compared to the separate agents, 
this approach is considered appropriate for the risk-benefit assessment of the FDC tablet.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The beneficial virological effects of RPV is clearly demonstrated in two pivotal phase III randomized 
trials, comparing RPV to EFV, both in combination with 2 NRTIs,  in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adults. NRTI backbones used were tenofovir/FTC (major part), abacavir/lamivudine or 
zidovudine/lamuvidine.  Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority of RPV to EFV; at 48 weeks follow-
up, the overall response rate (< 50 copies/mL) for pooled results was 84% and 82% for RPV and EFV 
respectively. Such response rates are similar to previous studies with EFV. 
A bioequivalent study showed equivalence between the fixed dose combination tablet and the free 
combination of the individual mono-components. Since efficacy and safety have been established with 
the monocomponents the results are considered also applicable for the combination product.  
RPV has a favourable tolerability profile compared to EFV, as relatively common skin disorders and 
neuro-psychiatric side effects were reported less frequently. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The beneficial effects in individuals with high baseline viral load (and low CD4 T-cell counts, often 
associated with high viral loads) are questionable.  Post-hoc analyses stratified for baseline viral load 
(≤100,000 versus >100,000 copies/ml) for the overall population and the tenofovir/emtricitabine 
subset confirmed the trend towards lower efficacy in patients with high baseline viral load (77% with 
TCM278 versus 81% with EFV) whereas efficacy was comparable (numerically higher) for patients with 
baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml (90% versus 84%). Although response rate appears lower in 
patients with CD4 count < 50 cells/l, numbers are too low to draw conclusions on the impact of low 
CD4 count.   
In phase 2b three doses of RPV were tested:  25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg. There was not an obvious 
difference in overall efficacy between doses, although a trend for higher incidence of virological failure 
with the lowest dose was noted. Due to concerns of QT-effects with the higher doses in a thorough QT 
study, the lowest dose was chosen for phase 3. Within phase 3, using the 25 mg dose, outcomes were 
associated to RPV exposure (using population PK data); the response rate was significantly lower for 
RPV patients belonging to AUC quartile 1 compared to AUC quartile 3. Hence, the exposure achieved 
with the 25 mg dose is just at the edge , or slightly below the Emax of RPV - which gives efficacy 
problems mainly in patients with a high baseline viral load, but less so in patients with lower viral 
loads.  Hence, any concomitant drugs that would lower the RPV exposure, as well as intake an intake 
in fasted state, is likely related to a risk of lower efficacy, and the development of resistance. It is 
uncertain whether these issues will be handled as carefully in clinical practice as within a well 
controlled trial. It is crucial that the need for correct intake (fed state) and the risk associated with 
certain interacting drugs is emphasized in the SmPC. However, the later restrictions might be difficult 
to handle in clinical and daily practice, with the potential risk of lower virologic response and 
emergence of resistance. Whether restrictions like low baseline viral load and dosing instructions can 
be met in daily clinical practice or that the somewhat suboptimal dose is more fragile here than within 
clinical trials, needs to be confirmed by the drug utilisation study and subsequent PSURs.  
It remains to be seen whether an increased dose of this order would make a substantial difference in 
the numbers of virological failure in those patients with a high baseline viral load. The rather low 
potency of rilpivirine might be the main obstacle with regards the risk of resistance development (1.2 
log10 reduction in monotherapy, regardless of dose used).  
Eviplera

In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken with more potent drugs. Although the drug might be an effective option, there is currently no 
data available in support of such use. The applicant will monitor such use in clinical practice and 
studies are ongoing in patients switching from other therapies to RPV. In addition to this, the applicant 
is requested to perform a drug interaction study with efavirenz and 50 mg rilpivirine dose as metabolic 
induction by efavirenz holds for quite some time. Further lowering exposure of the 25 mg dose 
rilpivirine might increase the risk of virological failure.  
Patients with a number of baseline HIV resistance associated mutations, an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate < 50 ml/min, AIDS defining illness or any significant co-existing illness were excluded 
from the phase III trials.  
The number of HIV patients aged over 65 years treated with RPV is too low to draw any conclusions for 
this subgroup. However, based on the mechanism of action there is no reason to expect a less 
beneficial effect of RPV among the elderly or those with co morbidity including renal insufficiency.  
Finally, the beneficial effect (non-inferiority of RPV to EFV) has been demonstrated in the phase III 
trials for 48 weeks of follow-up. The 96-weeks data of these trials are expected to become available by 
1Q 2012.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As with all ARVs, once there is virological failure there is a risk of emerging resistance. The 
extensiveness of this determines the available alternative ARVs left for 2nd line treatment. 
In the pivotal studies there was overall a 2-fold risk for virological failure for RPV-treated patients 
compared to those treated with for EFV; 10.5% versus 5.7%. About half of the patients with virological 
failure (both with RPV and EFV) developed resistance associated mutations; thus RPV was also 
associated with a 2-fold higher risk to develop resistance. Moreover, RPV resistance was associated 
with cross-resistance to the 2nd line NNRTI (etravirine) whereas in case of resistance to EFV, 
susceptibility to etravirine remained. In addition, patients failing RPV therapy more frequently 
developed resistance to the NRTI backbone (particularly emtricitabine/lamivudine) than did patients 
failing with efavirenz.  
Post-hoc analyses demonstrated that this increased risk of virologic failure was driven by patients with 
high baseline viral load ( i.e >100,000 copies/ml) , 15% with RPV versus 6% with EFV, whereas 
virologic failure rates were comparably low for patients with low baseline viral load, 3.8% versus 3.3%, 
regardless of NRTI backbone used.  Hence, for the high viral load strata, the risk for emerging 
resistance (NNRTI and/or NRTI) was 3-4 times higher for those treated with RPV compared to those 
treated with EFV. In contrast, the number of patients developing resistance was low and similar to that 
seen for efavirenz-treated patients within the low viral load strata.     
The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the patients treated with RPV were nausea, 
dizziness, abnormal dreams and headache. These AEs were mild and occurred less frequently with RPV 
than with EFV. 
Tenofovir carries a, dose dependent, risk for renal tubular toxicity which in turn causes phosphate loss 
with bone loss. Post-hoc analyses of the optional DEXA sub study within the phase 3 studies showed 
that there was no difference in bone parameters for rilpivirine and EFV at week 96, regardless of NRTI 
Eviplera

backbone. Also, rates of hypophosphatemia were quite the same between treatment arms. Therefore, 
there are no suggestions for a possible additive/synergistic risk for tubular toxicity when rilpivirine is 
given in combination with tenofovir. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
An extensive list of NNRTI-associated mutations (n= 39) constituted exclusion criteria in both phase 2b 
and phase 3 (around 10% of all screening failures).  Many of these NNRTI-associated mutations were 
quite infrequent though, and were neither seen in the in vitro resistance profile of RPV, nor in patients 
failing RPV therapy in the trials. In the final analyses of all data a list of 15 RPV-associated mutations is 
proposed to constitute those baseline mutations precluding RPV therapy in treatment naïve patients.  
This list covers the majority of the population not included in the trials, and the analyses behind it are 
endorsed. The combined frequency of these 15 mutations is high enough in untreated patients to 
request that resistance testing should be done prior to the use of RPV. This is reflected in the 
indication: as with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance testing should guide 
the use of rilpivirine and cross reference is made to the relevant sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
To perform resistance testing prior to the use of RPV is in line with the general recommendation in 
Europe - which implies that a baseline resistance testing should be done prior to starting HIV therapy 
(Vandamme et al, 2011). The other mutations used as exclusion criteria, not included in this list, were 
deselected by the company after final analyses of pre-clinical and clinical data; they were not found to 
affect activity in vitro and were not seen in any significant numbers in those failing RPV. Although they 
were formally not properly studied in vivo, the impact in response rates of the phase 3 studies would 
not have been significantly affected by their presence in the list of exclusion criteria. Future follow-up 
of resistance should be provided according to the proposed pharmacovigilance measures and the 
correctness of associated mutations should be confirmed. 
In a thorough QT-study a somewhat unexpected QTc increase above the threshold (just above 10 ms 
for female subjects) was seen at doses 75 mg or higher. As consequence any risk factor for QT 
prolongation was an exclusion criterion in the phase III trials giving an uncertainty about the safety of 
RPV in individuals with such risk factors. However, no difference in QTc increase was seen for the 75 
mg dose compared to and efavirenz in the phase 2b study (using common 12-lead ECGs). Also no 
significant QTc change was noted in an interaction study with RPV 150 mg qd in combination with 
darunavir/r, which further doubles the exposure. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the QT-
prolongation observed at a dose of 75 mg is currently unclear. 
Furthermore, post-hoc analyses showed a low incidence for patients with risk of QTc prolongation at 
screening to phase 3, and observed risk factors were of limited clinical relevance. Therefore, as the 25 
mg dose was not associated with QTc interval prolongation, no special warnings are required for the 
moment. A warning on QT prolongation with supratherapeutic dose (75 mg and higher) was included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The applicant could not provide additional safety data on parameters adequate for monitoring tubular 
injury (urine-protein, urine-β2-microglobulin etc), as these were not collected during the studies. 
However, other available data do not point toward tubular toxicity with rilpivirine. Still, given the fact 
that tenofovir exposure is highly dependent on renal clearance the effect of rilpivirine on renal 
clearance and creatinine levels is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC, as well that rilpivirine 
was only studied in patients with normal renal function.

Benefit Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As the targeted indication is the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ARV-naïve individuals, both tolerability 
and efficacy of the ARV regimen are of high importance; this is the start of a potential life-long 
treatment. In this light, the noted better tolerability of RPV compared to the golden standard EFV, is 
considered of clinical relevance. Also the qd dosage and low pill burden are advantages that can make 
it easier for patients to comply with therapy.  
A prerequisite of the ARV regimen is its virological potency. Any inability to suppress HIV replication is 
considered of clinical concern as this may lead to resistance hampering 2nd line ARV treatment 
options. Virological failure due to resistance should therefore be considered of greater clinical relevance 
than the tolerability of the regimen.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, it can be concluded that RPV was non-inferior to the active comparator EFV with respect to the 
most relevant clinical endpoint (<50 copies/mL). The potential extra benefit over EFV relies in a better 
tolerability, all be it predominantly the first four weeks of treatment, and the patients convenience 
having one tablet, once daily as ARV regimen. 
This benefit, together with the non-inferior efficacy, should be balanced against an overall 2-fold higher 
risk of RPV for developing virological failure and emerging resistance of which the latter has greater 
clinical consequences, as resistance to RPV was also more frequently associated with resistance 
development to the backbone NRTIs.  
In the pivotal phase III studies, the overall risk of emergence of resistance appeared to be about 6% 
versus 3% for RPV and EFV, respectively. In further analyses it was shown that, the increased risk of 
emerging resistance with TCM278 is driven by patients with high baseline viral load (>100,000 
copies/ml); these patients show lower virologic response rates and higher rates of virologic failure 
compared to EFV. On the other hand, for patients with baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/ml TCM278 
showed numerically higher response rate and a low risk of emerging resistance and in the same order 
of magnitude as observed for EFV. It can be expected that the ongoing studies up to 96 weeks will 
confirm the observed comparative efficacy and safety profiles of RPV.  
Based on these arguments the limited benefit of better tolerability does not weigh against the higher 
risk for emerging resistance for treatment naïve patients at large - the risk of failure and its 
consequences are not acceptable for patients with a high baseline viral load, taking into account the 
performance of other available first line options for such patients. Therefore, the CHMP considers that 
the benefits outweighs the risks when RPV is restricted to patients with low baseline viral load.  
Since the 25 mg dose is at the edge of being suboptimal, it is crucial that the exposure is not lowered 
(concomitant drugs, need for intake in fed state); there is always a risk that these issues are handled 
less strict in clinical practice than within a clinical trial, where everything is closely monitored. This risk 
was emphasized in the respective sections of the SmPC. Therapy should be guided by resistance 
testing as it is considered current good clinical practice in line with the general recommendation 
according to updated European treatment guidelines. 
In clinical practice rilpivirine might be considered a potential option for switch once viral load has been 
broken with more potent drugs. Although the drug might be an effective option, there is currently no 
Eviplera

data available in support of such use. The applicant will monitor such use in clinical practice and new 
studies are on going on use in patients switching from other therapies to RPV. 
Discussion on the Benefit Risk Balance 
From an individual patient perspective, the reason for judging an ARV agent to be abandoned from the 
1st line regimen, either intolerability or insufficient virological effect, is not so relevant as long as 
alternate future, 2nd line, options are still available. Rilpivirine presents a higher risk for emerging 
resistance limiting 2nd line options, although nevertheless available 2nd line options in general still 
remain. However, whenever possible, avoidance of emerging resistance is considered more critical 
than tolerability.    
The restriction of the indication to patients with low baseline viral load resolves the major concern on 
increased risk of emerging resistance compared to efavirenz. As mention above although the potential 
consequences of developing resistance are of greater concern with RPV given the potential loss of 
treatment options, the absolute risk is low and available 2nd line options still remain. Interaction with 
drugs that lower RPV exposure is contraindicated given the potential lower efficacy and subsequent 
emergence of resistance and RPV must be taken in fed state. Within these restrictions, in patients with 
low viral load the risks are outweighed by the benefits of RPV showing a comparable high virologic 
response rate with a better tolerability profile to efavirenz and a favourable once-daily dosing regimen.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Eviplera “indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult patients with a viral load ≤ 100,000 
HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The demonstration of the benefit of the combination emtricitabine, rilpivirine 
hydrochloride and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in antiretroviral therapy is based on week 48 safety 
and efficacy analyses from two randomised, double-blind, controlled Phase III studies in treatment-
naïve patients (see section 5.1). As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance 
testing should guide the use of Eviplera (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

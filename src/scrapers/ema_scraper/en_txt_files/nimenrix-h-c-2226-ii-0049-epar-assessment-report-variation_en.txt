2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
10 November 2016 
Nimenrix is a vaccine indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and 
above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 
and Y. Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies are known to protect against meningococcal diseases via 
complement mediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies 
against capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, which are measured by assays using 
either rabbit complement (rSBA) or human complement (hSBA). Vaccine efficacy was inferred from the 
demonstration of immunologic non inferiority (based mainly on comparing proportions with rSBA titres at 
least 8) to licensed meningococcal vaccines.  
This variation includes submission of the clinical study reports (CSR) on a randomised, open label, 
controlled, multicentre, primary vaccination study (MenACWY-TT-083) to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of 2 vs. 3 doses of Nimenrix in infants followed by a booster dose at the age of 12 
months.   
As background to this variation the initial application dossier for Nimenrix included studies to support use 
from 12 months of age. At that time the MAH (GSK) had only data on one vs. two doses for the age group 
9 to 12 months in MenACWY-TT-055/062, in which infants aged 9 months received 2 doses (the second 
dose when they were ~12 months old) and those aged 12 months received a single dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 6/61 
 
  
  
 
 
One month after vaccination (i.e. at month 4 (M4) of study) in the single dose (ACWY-1) group, 79.5% 
and 94.6% had hSBA-MenA and C titres ≥1:8, respectively, compared to 50.8% for MenW and 56.1% for 
MenY. In the ACWY-2 group the post-dose 2 (i.e. M4) percentages with hSBA ≥1:8 were at least 
numerically higher at 88.4%, 100%, 99.3% and 99.3% for respective meningococcal serogroups. The M4 
GMTs were lower for the ACWY-1 group vs. the ACWY-2 group. Even for MenA, with the least difference 
between one and two doses, the 95% CI did not overlap.    
By month 12 (M12) of the study the percentages with hSBA titres ≥1:8 were 87.5%, 89.4% and 80.0% 
for MenC, MenW-135 and Men Y, respectively, in the ACWY-1 group. Higher percentages (91.2%, 99.1% 
and 92.5%, respectively) had such titres in the ACWY-2 group. In contrast, against MenA 20.6% ACWY-1 
and 25.9% ACWY-2 subjects had hSBA titres ≥1:8. For MenA and MenC in the ACWY-1 group and for all 
meningococcal serogroups in the ACWY-2 group the hSBA GMTs decreased from M1 to M12. The ACWY-1 
group showed increases in the GMTs for MenW (from 11 to 128) and Y (from 15 to 56). These hSBA data 
suggested a possible benefit for two doses when the first was given at 9 months.   
The MAH has since completed a study (MenACWY-TT-083) that compares two doses of Nimenrix at 2 and 
4 months of age with 3 doses at 2, 3 and 4 months of age in infancy, each followed by a single booster 
dose at 12 months of age. Two control groups are used (a MenC-CRM197 conjugate and a MenC-TT 
conjugate). In each group the meningococcal conjugate vaccines were co-administered with Infanrix 
hexa (DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T) and Synflorix (10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). Based on the 
results, the MAH proposes a 2+1 dose regimen starting from 6 weeks of age in this variation. 
Some elements of the design of study MenACWY-TT-083 were discussed as part of the request for 
scientific advice from CHMP. In particular, the use of non-inferiority immune responses compared to 
licensed MencC conjugate vaccines was agreed, along with the immunological endpoints 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310864/2007). Study MenACWY-TT-083 is also part of the paediatric investigation 
plan (PIP) and its design was discussed in detail with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The most 
appropriate control vaccines were discussed and agreed during the initial PIP procedure. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The application is based on a single newly reported clinical study MenACWY-TT-083. This was an open 
label randomised and active controlled study in infants. It was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
the immune response to MenC elicited by Nimenrix (MenACWY-TT) when given intramuscularly at 2, 4 
and 12 months of age or at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age compared to two licensed MenC conjugate 
vaccines (one CRM197 and one TT conjugate) given intramuscularly at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. The 
study was conducted between July 2010 and September 2013 at 44 centres in three countries (Estonia, 
Germany and Spain). 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

Study participants 
The study population consisted of previously unvaccinated (except for neonatal HBV or BCG) healthy 
male and female infants aged between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) at the time of the first vaccination 
and born after a gestation period of at least 36 weeks. Infants were excluded if they had received > 14 
days in total of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth or had any other 
reason to have immunodeficiency. Non-study vaccinations were not allowed except for rotavirus and 
influenza vaccines (at any time) and MMR[V], which was allowed due to a measles outbreak that led to 
relaxing the initial plan to delay administration of MMR[V] until after Visit 6. Other exclusions were 
standard for infant vaccination studies, including state of health at each visit that could result in deferred 
dosing. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives  
The following 6 co-primary objectives were assessed in a hierarchical manner in the following order: 
1.  To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) non-inferiority (5% NI margin) of the 3-dose 
schedule of MenACWY-TT vs. the 2-dose schedule of MenC-CRM197 (Menjugate) for percentages 
with rSBA-MenC ≥1:8. 
2.  To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) non-inferiority (5% NI margin) of the 3-dose 
schedule of MenACWY-TT vs. the 2-dose schedule of MenC-TT (NeisVac-C) for percentages with 
rSBA-MenC≥1:8. 
3.  To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) the immunogenicity of the 3-dose schedule for 
MenACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y based on rSBA ≥ 1:8 in at least 80%. 
Objectives 4, 5 and 6 were the same as 1, 2 and 3 except that the comparisons were made for the 2-dose 
schedule of MenACWY-TT.   
Secondary objectives 
These included comparisons of rSBA at different time points, hSBA titres as measured in subsets, immune 
responses to the antigens in Infanrix hexa (including the anti-poliovirus titres that were submitted during 
the procedure) and to Synflorix. These comparisons were based on the usual cut-off values except that 
there was a change in the pneumococcal assay so that data are reported for 0.15 μg/ml and 0.35 μg/ml 
cut-offs.

antibodies in a randomised subset of 25% of subjects, at pre-vaccination, one month 
after the final priming vaccination, pre-booster and one month post-booster dose.  
Sample size 
The target sample size was 1650 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity (412 per vaccine group). 
Assuming ~20% might have withdrawn or not been evaluable for immunogenicity, the target sample size 
was 2060 (515 per vaccine group). 
Treatment and Randomisation 
The randomisation of subjects to vaccine group was performed at GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, using 
MATEX. Subjects were allocated using GSK’s SBIR system. A randomisation block scheme was used to 
ensure that correct balance between treatments was maintained. The randomisation algorithm used a 
minimisation procedure accounting for centre. Treatments were as follows for the four groups:

Laboratory assays and time-points 
The assays were conducted in various laboratories as shown below. Most were conducted by GSK using 
previously reported methodologies that have been fully reviewed in recent years. 
Immunological parameters used to interpret immune responses  
1.  Functional anti-meningococcal activity was determined by a serum bactericidal test according to 
the CDC protocol [Maslanka, 1997] using baby rabbit complement. Using human complement, 
hSBA  titres  of  at  least  1:4  broadly  correlate  with  protection  against  invasive  meningococcal 
disease due to serogroup C [Goldschneider 1969]. This same cut-off has been proposed to apply 
to serogroups A and B. Bactericidal antibody titres measured using baby rabbit complement are 
higher than those measured using human complement. Based on UK data, rSBA titres against 
MenC of at least 1:8 have been proposed to correlate with short-term protection [Andrews, 2003; 
Borrow, 2005]. However, rSBA titres of 1:128 also correlate well with hSBA titres 1:4 for MenC 
and a rSBA titre of 1:168 has been regarded as a more conservative correlate of protection than 
1:8. Therefore, the MAH presented percentages reaching rSBA titres at least 1:8 and at least 
1:128. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 12/61 
 
  
  
 
2.  Functional anti-meningococcal activity was also determined by a serum bactericidal test using 
human  complement  (hSBA).  Percentages  reaching  titres  at  least  1:4  and  at  least  1:8  were 
presented. 
3.  Specific antibodies against DT (anti-D) and TT (anti-TT) were measured by an ELISA developed 
in-house or a multiplex immuno-assay (Luminex) developed in-house. The cut-off of the tests 
was set at 0.1 IU/ml [Camargo, 1984; Melville-Smith, 1983]. Antibody concentrations greater 
than or equal to this value were considered as protective. In subjects with post-vaccination anti-D 
concentration <0.1 IU/ml, thepost-vaccination serum samples was to be retested using a Vero 
cell neutralisation test [Miyamura, 1974a; Miyamura, 1974b]. The cut-off of the Vero-cell assay 
was 0.016 IU/ml. 
4.  Antibodies  against  the  pertussis  components  PT,  FHA  and  PRN  were  measured  by  an  ELISA 
technique developed in-house or a multiplex immuno-assay (Luminex) developed in-house. The 
cut-off  for  all  three  pertussis  antibodies  was  5  EL.U/ml.  Subjects  with  antibody  concentration 
below  this  cut-off  were  considered  seronegative.  No  correlate  of  protection  is  defined  for  the 
immune response to pertussis antigens [Granstrom, 1987; Kaprinski, 1987]. 
5.  Antibodies to HBs antigen were measured by a CLIA developed in-house. Antibody concentrations 
greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml were considered protective [CDC, 1991 and WHO, 2009]. 
There was a change in the Hepatitis B assay at the time of testing. Antibodies to HBsAg were 
measured using CLIA with a cut-off of 6.2 mIU/ml.  
6. 
 Antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were determined by a virus microneutralisation 
test adapted from the WHO Guidelines for WHO/EPI Collaborative Studies on Poliomyelitis [WHO, 
1993]. The lowest dilution at which serum samples are to be tested is 1:8, from which a test is 
considered positive. Titres will be expressed in terms of the reverse of the dilution resulting in 
50% inhibition. Antibody titres greater than or equal 1:8 are considered as protective. 
7.  Total  antibodies  against  the  Hib  polysaccharide  PRP  were  measured  by  an  ELISA  or  multiplex 
developed in-house. The cut-off of the test was 0.15 μg/ml. Antibody concentrations greater than 
or equal to this value were considered as protective [Makela 1977]. 
8.  Pneumococcal serotype specific total IgG antibodies (antibodies to 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19F and 23F) were each measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA [Concepcion, 2001]. The antibody 
concentration was determined by logistic log comparison of the ELISA  curves  with a standard 
reference serum 89-SF available from the US FDA for which concentration of IgG and IgM to the 
10 serotypes are known in μg/ml [Quataert, 1995]. The cut-off of the assay was 0.15 μg/ml. 
One extra dose of the most appropriate licensed vaccine was offered to subjects presenting with any of 
the following at the post-booster vaccination time point: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
anti-PRP antibody concentration < 0.15 μg/ml, 
rSBA-MenC antibody titre < 1:8, 
anti-D or anti-TT antibody concentration < 0.1 IU/ml,

As no immunological correlate of protection had been defined for pneumococcal serotypes, no extra dose 
of a pneumococcal vaccine was to be offered.

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open study. However, the laboratory in charge of testing was blinded to treatment 
assignment. Codes were used to link the subject and study to each sample.  
Statistical methods 
The co-primary objectives (1-6 as stated above) were to be assessed in a hierarchical manner. A 
co-primary objective could only be met if the statistical criterion for that objective was met as well as the 
statistical criteria for all previous co-primary objectives. For this reason, the multiplicity of objectives did 
not require an alpha adjustment. However, it impacted the beta parameter as Objective 6 could only be 
reached if all six objectives were met simultaneously. The global power to meet all primary objectives 
considering a sample size of 412 evaluable subjects per group was at least 82.3%.  
Analysis sets

• 
• 
The Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort included all vaccinated subjects during the primary 
phase.  
The Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort for Immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects from 
the primary phase with immunogenicity data. 
The Primary ATP cohort for safety included all vaccinated subjects who met the selection 
criteria 
The Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the Primary 
ATP cohort for safety who did not receive forbidden medications, had no medical condition 
which might have influenced the immune response, complied with the vaccination schedule 
for Visits 1, 2 and 3 and the blood sample schedule for Visit 4.  
The Booster Total Vaccinated cohort included all subjects who received a booster dose at Visit 
5.  
The Booster Total Vaccinated cohort for immunogenicity included all who received a booster 
dose with post-booster immunogenicity data. 
The Booster ATP cohorts for safety and immunogenicity were defined as for the primary 
cohorts with addition of having a blood sample from Visit 6. The interval between the Visit 5 
and 6 blood samples was to be 21 to 48 days.  
The primary analyses of immunogenicity were based on the defined ATP immunogenicity cohorts.  
All CI computed were two-sided 95% CI. The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group were 
calculated based on the method by Clopper. The standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference 
in proportions were based on the method of Newcombe [1998]. 
The 95% CIs for GMTs/GMCs were obtained within each group separately. The 95% CI for the mean of 
log-transformed titre/concentration was first obtained assuming that log-transformed values were 
normally distributed with unknown variance. The 95% CI for the GMTs/GMCs were then obtained by 
exponential transformation of the 95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titre/concentration. The 95% 
CIs of the group GMC/GMT ratios were computed using an ANOVA model on the log10 transformation of 
the concentrations/titres. The ANOVA model included the vaccine group as fixed effect. 
The final analysis was performed on the data collected up to one month after the booster vaccine dose 
(administered at Visit 5) and used cleaned data.

2.4.1.1.  Results 
Recruitment, Conduct of the study and numbers analysed 
The first subject was enrolled on 01 July 2010 and the last study visit was on 10 September 2013. 
There were 3 amendments to the original protocol dated 27 January 2010: 
•  Amendment 1 (06 December 2010) included some administrative changes. 
•  Amendment 2 (25 May 2011) increased the sample size by approximately 50% so that 680 
additional subjects were to be enrolled to reach 1650 evaluable subjects. Testing for S. 
pneumoniae OPA was removed. 
•  Amendment 3 (30 July 2012) allowed administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine throughout the 
study to address a measles outbreak in Spain. 
Most (1559) of the 2095 subjects were enrolled in Spain, followed by 502 in Germany and 34 in Estonia. 
Of these, 2042 subjects completed the primary phase and 1841 were included in the primary ATP 
immunogenicity cohort. Most of the exclusions were due to missing immunogenicity data (148) or due to 
lack of adherence to the vaccination (41) or sampling (25) schedules. The mean age of the subjects in the 
primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks (range 6 to 12 weeks; median 9 weeks) with an 
equal gender split.   
Table 2.  Numbers of subjects vaccinated, completed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal – 
primary epoch (primary total vaccinated cohort) 
A total of 2017 subjects received a booster vaccination of which 2006 completed the booster phase, 1995 
completed the study and 1815 were included in the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The mean 
age of the subjects in the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 12.1 months (range 12 to 13 
months). 
Baseline data 
Primary vaccination phase 
Across all vaccine groups, the mean age of the subjects at the first vaccination in the primary TVC was 8.6 
weeks (standard deviation [SD] ±1.5). The distribution of males and females was similar, with 50.2% 
male and 49.8% female. By race, the majority of subjects were of White Caucasian/European heritage 
(94.4%). 
Booster phase

Across all vaccine groups, the mean age of the subjects at the time of booster vaccination in the booster 
TVC was 12.1 months (SD ±0.4). The distribution of males and females was similar, with 50.1% male and 
49.9% female. By race, the majority of subjects were of White Caucasian/European heritage (94.5%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Immune responses to meningococcal polysaccharides 
In accordance with the pre-defined criteria, non-inferiority of the 3-dose schedule of MenACWY-TT was 
demonstrated vs. MenC-CRM and MenC-TT. 
The lower confidence interval limits around the percentages with rSBA titres ≥1:8 in the ACWY_3 group 
were >80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages in the 3-dose 
group with titres ≥1:128 except for MenY (76.6%).  
Except for MenA, the GMTs were numerically lower for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT. GMTs for MenC were 
significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the MenC-CRM197 and MenC-TT groups as well as 
vs. the MenACWY-TT 2-dose group (95% CI did not overlap).

immunogenicity) 
PIII(M3): time point for blood sampling one month after the primary vaccination 
Non-inferiority  of  the  2-dose  schedule  of  MenACWY-TT  was  demonstrated  vs.  MenC-CRM197  and 
MenC-TT and the lower confidence interval limits for percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were >80% for 
each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages in the 2-dose group with titres 
≥1:128 except for MenA (78.2%). The MenC GMT was significantly lower for the 2-dose MenACWY-TT 
group vs. the monovalent MenC vaccines (95% CI did not overlap). 
Further exploration of the rSBA MenC GMTs indicated that the 95% CI around the GMTs for the 
MenACWY-TT 2-dose and 3-dose groups vs. the monovalent MenC conjugate vaccines all fell below 0.80 
and, except for 2 doses vs. MenC-CRM197, were ≤0.60.

The results by country suggested lower responses in Estonia based on percentages with ≥1:128 and GMTs 
but there were very few subjects so such comparisons are not robust. 
The hSBA titres are summarised below and demonstrate a very similar pattern of between-group 
comparisons as described for the rSBA data.

hSBA-MenY antibody titre equal to or above 1:4 and 1:8 and GMTs (primary cohort for immunogenicity) 
The percentages with MenC hSBA titres ≥1:4 and 1:8 were comparable between each MenACWY-TT and 
monovalent MenC conjugate groups with lower 95% CI around the differences all within -4%. The 
comparisons of GMTs showed upper 95% CI that fell below 0.7 and, except for the 2-dose group vs. 
MenC-TT, below 0.6. 
Before and after the booster dose, the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 
3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose 
group with non-overlapping 95% CI. 
Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar proportions with pre- and post-boost 
titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI within -4%. GMTs were similar for the 
two MenACWY-TT and MenC-CRM197 groups but lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not 
overlap. The post-boost results were similar for Spain and Germany.

The  pre-  and  post-boost  hSBA  data  showed  comparable  titres  between  the  MenACWY-TT  2-dose  and 
3-dose groups. The GMTs for MenW and MenY were higher in the 2-dose group but the 95% CI overlapped 
(only just for MenW). For MenC the GMTs were higher in the two monovalent groups but the 95% CI 
overlapped for all between-group comparisons.

Immune responses to co-administered antigens 
Anti-D and anti-TT antibody concentrations 
After the primary series: 
•  All subjects had anti-D and anti-TT ≥0.1 IU/ml. 
• 
• 
The percentage with anti-D ≥1.0 IU/ml and the anti-D GMT were highest in the MenC-CRM197 
group but at least 84% per group reached this titre. 
The percentage with anti-TT ≥1.0 IU/ml and the anti-T GMT were highest in the MenC-TT group 
but at least 95% reached this titre. 
Table 7.  Number and percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-TT antibody concentrations equal to or 
above 0.1 IU per ml and 1.0 IU per ml and GMCs (Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
Pre-booster: 
•  At least 86% retained anti-D ≥0.1 IU/ml (97.5% in the MenC-CRM197 group) but the percentages 
with ≥1.0 IU/ml were from 6.1% (ACWY_3) to 21.0% (MenC-CRM197). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016

•  At least 99% per group had anti-TT ≥0.1 IU/ml while 30.3% (MenC-CRM197 group) to 47.0% 
(MenC-TT group) had ≥1.0 IU/ml. 
Post-booster: 
•  All subjects had anti-D and anti-TT ≥0.1 IU/ml. 
• 
• 
Percentages with anti-D ≥1.0 IU/ml ranged from 94.6% (ACWY_2) to 100% (MenC-CRM197) and 
the highest GMC was in the MenC-CRM197 group. 
Percentages with anti-TT ≥1.0 IU/ml were at least 99% per group and the highest GMT was 
observed for the MenC-TT group.

Responses to pertussis antigens 
In the absence of any established ICP, the analysis was based on percentages with anti-PT, anti-FHA and 
anti-PRN antibody concentrations ≥ 5 EL.U/ml, the percentages classified as responders and the GMCs. 
These were broadly comparable between the four vaccine groups at each time point and are summarised 
by the figures below.

There were no important differences between the four treatment groups for the post-primary, pre-boost 
or post-boost anti-HBsAg antibody concentrations.

Responses to Hib antigens 
Differences in the anti-PRP responses emerged for percentages with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥
1.0 μg/ml and the GMCs, such that the lowest response was seen in the MenC-CRM197 group after the 
primary doses.

Table 11.  Number and percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations equal to or above 
0.15 microgram per ml and 1.0 microgram per ml and GMCs (Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
However, this pattern disappeared after the booster dose when GMCs were numerically lower for the 
MenACWY-TT groups but almost all subjects achieved ≥1.0 μg/ml anti-PRP. 
Table 12.  Number and percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations equal to or above 
0.15 microgram per ml and 1.0 microgram per ml and GMCs (Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
Responses to IPV antigens 
It should be noted that all subjects received both IPV and a meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Therefore 
the only comparisons that can be made are with respect to any differences for the Nimenrix groups and 
the monovalent groups with respect to immune responses to the IPV contained in Infanrix hexa. 
Bearing in mind this limitation, the relevant tables comparing 2-dose and 3-dose Nimenrix groups with 
the monovalent MenC groups are shown below for the post-primary time point. These tables demonstrate 
no disadvantages for the Nimenrix groups in terms of percentages reaching titres 1:8 to any of the 3 
polioviruses. After the booster dose all subjects in all vaccine groups who were tested had titres of at least 
1:8 for each poliovirus (data not shown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 26/61 
 
  
  
 
 
The comparisons of GMTs at the post-primary time point also generally showed no major differences. 
There are instances in which values are slightly higher or lower with Nimenrix. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 27/61 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the booster dose all GMTs exceeded 900 and all except the GMT in the 3-dose Nimenrix group for 
poliovirus 1 exceeded 1000. The GMTs were higher in the monovalent MenC groups with the exception of 
the response to poliovirus 3 in the Nimenrix 2-dose group, which was higher than values in either 
monovalent MenC group. However, since there was a very clear and profound anamnestic response to IPV 
in all groups it is not at all likely that the differences observed are clinically important. 
Responses to Synflorix 
After the primary series the percentages with antibody concentrations ≥0.35 µg/mL was at least 74.0% 
for all groups and all serotypes. The lowest GMC observed was 0.7 μg/ml (serotype 5 in the ACWY2 
group) and the highest was 8.51 μg/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As shown in the table 
below, antibody concentrations for individual serotypes were generally comparable across the four 
treatment groups.

Prior to the booster dose there were considerable differences in antibody concentrations between 
serotypes but, within each serotype, there were no major differences between treatment groups. After 
the booster dose concentrations ≥0.35 µg/mL were observed for at least 91.1% of subjects against each 
serotype. The lowest GMC was 0.84 μg/ml (serotype 5 in the MenC-TT group) and the highest was 9.75 
μg/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As before, the antibody concentrations for individual 
serotypes were broadly similar across the four treatment groups.  
Total vaccinated cohort analysis 
Since the percentage of subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohorts (primary and 
booster phases) was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohorts (TVC) was 
performed. The exploratory and descriptive results for immunogenicity for the Total Vaccinated Cohorts 
were consistent with the results for the ATP immunogenicity cohorts for both the primary and booster 
phases.

The MAH seeks approval from 6 weeks of age, however the mean age of the subjects in the primary ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks and the median was 9 weeks and infants had to have been born 
after at least 36 weeks gestation. The MAH was therefore requested during the procedure to present the 
numbers of infants who were actually 6-8 weeks old at the time of the first dose and to provide the 
immune responses to meningococcal antigens for those aged <8 weeks and >8 weeks at enrolment. 
The protocol stipulated that eligible subjects were to be between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) old at the 
time of the first vaccination. The demographic characteristics of infants aged 6 to 8 weeks and >8 weeks 
at the time of first dose for the primary analysis according to protocol (ATP) cohort showed that overall 
the distribution of infants between the two age groups was balanced, with 869 infants (47.2%) 6 to 8 
weeks of age and 972 infants (52.8%) >8 weeks of age. Similar female:male distributions were seen in 
the ≤8 weeks group (433 females and 436 males; 49.8% and 50.2%, respectively) and the >8 weeks 
group (479 females and 493 males; 49.3% and 50.7%, respectively).  These similar distributions for 
infants 6 to 8 weeks and >8 weeks are seen in each of the vaccine groups.  
At the 1-month post-primary vaccination series time point (1 month after the last priming dose [PIII(M3)] 
in Table 14), in both the 2-dose and the 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups, the percentage of subjects 
achieving rSBA titres of ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the >8 weeks age 
groups for all meningococcal serogroups (Table 14).  
At the same time point and for the 2-dose and 3-dose regimens, the percentage of subjects achieving 
hSBA titres ≥1:4 and ≥1:8 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the >8 weeks age groups for all 
serogroups (not shown in this report). 
There are some instances for rSBA suggesting slightly lower responses in the younger cohort but these 
become apparent only at the upper titre cut-off. This pattern was not seen with the hSBA data.

Assay performance 
During the procedure the MAH was asked to discuss changes in sensitivity with the rSBA and hSBA used 
in the initial Nimenrix application and the assays used in this extension of indication (assay results were 
higher with rSBA vs. hSBA in the MAA but the opposite was seen in the current application). The MAH 
clarified that for post-licensure studies (including Study MenACWY-TT-083) the Company switched from 
the GSK rSBA to the Public Health England (PHE) rSBA assay at the end of 2011. The GSK and PHE rSBA 
assays have different levels of sensitivity. Titres measured with the PHE rSBA are generally lower than 
those obtained with the GSK assays used at the time of licensure of Nimenrix. This is especially true for 
pre vaccination (baseline) sera. 
It was clarified that there were no changes in assay procedure or conditions during testing, except for 
routine changes in qualified lots of complement and bacteria to replace lots that became consumed. Assay 
performance during the testing of serum samples from Study MenACWY-TT-083 was monitored routinely 
via quality control sample (QCS) titres, which did not reveal a shift or drift in assay performance over the 
period spanning MenACWY-TT-083 testing. Based on the data submitted using either assay it is clear that 
there is a marked immune response to Nimenrix, that it is not substantially improved by giving 3 vs. 2 
doses, that immune responses to MenA, W-135 and Y are much higher in the Nimenrix group, whilst GMTs 
for MenC are higher with the monovalent vaccines.  
Additionally the MAH was also asked to provide rSBA and hSBA assay performance data generated at PHE 
and GSK, respectively, during the testing of sera from studies submitted with the initial MAA. These data 
did not indicate any shifts in sensitivity of either assay. 
Data on GMTs for Meningococcal serogroup C in Nimenrix vs. control groups 
It was observed that one month post-primary vaccination rSBA-MenC and hSBA MenC geometric mean 
titres (GMTs) are lower in the MenACWY-TT groups compared to the control vaccines. The clinical 
significance of this difference in GMTs is not known. The clinically relevant endpoint is rather the 
percentage of subjects with MenC titers equal to or above the seroprotective level (>1:8) one month post 
primary vaccination.   
As can be seen in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC and 
hSBA-MenC titers >1:8 one month after the primary vaccination [time point PIII(M3)] are similar 
between MenACWY-TT and the control vaccines (>98.6% of subjects with titres >1:8 for rSBA and hSBA).  
The same holds true for both the pre-booster and post-booster time points [PIII(M10) and PIV(M11) in 
Table 5 and Table 6. This observation suggests that the protection against MenC provided by 
MenACWY-TT can be expected to be similar to that provided by both Menjugate and NeisVac-C in infants 
and toddlers.    
Using the PHE assay, prior evaluations using MenC serological data and vaccine effectiveness data 
support the utility of looking at percentages with titres at least 1:8 but also at percentages reaching 
higher thresholds (e.g. at least 1:64 post-primary). Nevertheless, the reverse cumulative distribution 
curves for post-primary rSBA and hSBA titres (shown below) do not diverge (i.e. in that no group falls 
below 90% reaching that threshold) until titres higher than ~128-256. These curves support a conclusion 
that the differences in GMTs are not very likely to have clinical significance.

Notes 
Post-boost GMTs demonstrated anamnestic responses to MenACWY-TT 
No indication of important differences in co-administration effects for

The subset hSBA data followed the rSBA data in pattern of responses 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study was of adequate design and conduct. It was of necessity open label but the primary endpoints 
are laboratory readouts and these were produced by staff unaware of the treatment assignment. Given 
the age of the subjects and volumes of blood needed, it is acceptable that assays were conducted in 
randomly selected subsets. 
Although enrolment was predominant in Spain, the data by country indicated comparable patterns of 
responses between Spain and Germany. There are too few subjects from Estonia to comment. In 
accordance with the countries that participated in the study, in which there has not been widespread 
vaccination of women now of child-bearing age against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W or Y, the 
pre-vaccination titres in infants were very low. In the UK, where there was a large catch-up programme 
at the time of introduction of MenC vaccination, a substantial proportion of women now giving birth may 
have been primed with a MenC conjugate. Nevertheless, their circulating antibody is likely to be low, so 
that infant levels are not expected to be at a level that could interfere with the infant immune response. 
Minimum age for use 
The MAH seeks approval from 6 weeks of age. The mean age of the subjects in the primary ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks and the median was 9 weeks and infants had to have been born after at 
least 36 weeks gestation. The demographic characteristics of infants aged 6 to 8 weeks and >8 weeks at 
the time of first dose for the primary analysis according to protocol (ATP) cohort showed that overall the 
distribution of infants between the two age groups was balanced, with 869 infants (47.2%) 6 to 8 weeks 
of age and 972 infants (52.8%) >8 weeks of age. At 1-month after the last priming dose [PIII(M3)] in 
Table 14), in both the 2-dose and the 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups, the percentage of subjects achieving 
rSBA titres of ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the >8 weeks age groups for 
all meningococcal serogroups (similar results with hSBA at titres ≥1:4 and ≥1:8).   
The data indicate a good spread of ages and the rSBA and hSBA results support the use of 2 doses even 
in infants aged 6-< 8 weeks at the time of the first dose. 
Immune responses to meningococcal polysaccharides 
This study met all six of the pre-defined elements of the primary analysis, which was conducted in a 
hierarchical fashion. It is noted that the comparisons of percentages achieving the pre-defined titres were 
based on a non-inferiority margin of 5% in each case. In light of the anticipated high titres and the 
life-threatening nature of the disease to be prevented, this margin is acceptable. In the primary series the 
rSBA data indicated at least comparable responses to MenC between either 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY-TT 
and the two monovalent MenC conjugates. In addition, the data showed that the lower bounds of the 95% 
CI around the differences in percentages with MenC rSBA titres ≥1:8 were actually within -4%.  
Only at the higher cut-offs, reflecting the differences in GMTs, was there a possible advantage for the 
monovalent MenC vaccines. Even then, >90% in the MenACWY groups had rSBA titres ≥1:128. Some of 
the findings suggested that 2 doses of MenACWY might actually be better than 3 doses. For example, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 40/61 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
rSBA GMTs for MenC were significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the other three groups 
(95% CI did not overlap).  
In addition, the rSBA responses to MenA, W and Y did not suggest an advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of 
MenACWY-TT. In each case very high percentages in both groups had rSBA titres ≥1:8 at M3 of the study 
(i.e. at about 5 months of age). The lower confidence interval limits around the percentages with rSBA 
titres ≥1:8 were >80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages with 
titres ≥1:128 except for MenY in the 3-dose group (76.6%) and MenA in the 2-dose group (78.2%).  
Although the study was not powered for the comparison of hSBA data (as measured by GSK) between 
groups, there was a very similar pattern of between-group comparisons as described for the rSBA data 
(as measured by PHE) for each meningococcal serogroup at M3 of the study. The hSBA data 
demonstrated a greater advantage for 2 vs. 3 doses of MenACWY-TT than the rSBA data. 
The hSBA titres at M3 also showed that the advantage of monovalent MenC conjugates was evident only 
at the upper titre cut-offs, again reflecting the GMTs. As for the rSBA data, it seems unlikely that the 
differences observed are clinically important given that > 90% who received MenACWY-TT had hSBA 
titres ≥1:8. 
Before and after the booster dose the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 
3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose 
group with non-overlapping 95% CI. Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar 
proportions with pre- and post-boost titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI 
within -4%.  
The post-boost GMTs for MenC rSBA were similar for the two MenACWY-TT and MenC-CRM197 groups but 
lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not overlap. In the two MenACWY-TT groups all 
post-boost GMTs were higher than the post-primary GMTs, supporting the existence of anamnestic 
responses to the final dose. 
The pre- and post-boost hSBA data showed a comparable pattern of post-boost responses vs. rSBA and 
further demonstrated anamnestic immune responses to the final dose of MenACWY-TT.    
Immune responses to co-administered antigens 
In the CHMP scientific advice of 2013 the MAH (GSK) asked about omitting documentation of immune 
responses to co-administered vaccines. The MAH was advised that in the absence of such data the SmPC 
would have to carefully clarify that all information on co-administration came from subjects at least 12 
months old. Therefore, although lack of such data would not per se preclude an approval for use of 
Nimenrix in infancy, it would likely severely limit the use of the vaccine at routine immunisation 
programme visits.  
In response, the MAH decided to conduct assays of immune responses to co-administered antigens. Since 
this was performed for a representative sample from each treatment group, the data allow for an 
assessment of any impact of MenACWY-TT compared to MenC-CRM197 or MenC-TT. In addition, since all 
the data on immune responses to meningococcal antigens were obtained against the same background of 
co-administered vaccines, concluding that responses to MenACWY-TT are satisfactory automatically 
implies that it may be given with DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T and with Synflorix. Such data cannot be used to 
support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with PRP-CRM197 or PRP-D constructs or with Prevenar13 in 
infancy. With regard to the actual immune responses to co-administered antigens: 
• 
The post-primary and post-boost anti-D and anti-TT antibody concentrations were satisfactory 
and GMCs showed the expected effects of the conjugates co-administered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 41/61 
 
  
  
•  Whilst there is no ICP applicable to pertussis there were no marked differences in antibody to PT, 
FHA or PRN between treatment groups. 
• 
• 
The post-primary antibody results demonstrate no disadvantages for the Nimenrix groups in 
terms of percentages reaching titres 1:8 to any of the 3 polioviruses. After the booster dose all 
subjects in all vaccine groups who were tested had titres of at least 1:8 for each poliovirus. 
Antibody concentrations data showed no major differences. 
There were no important differences between the four treatment groups for the post-primary, 
pre-boost or post-boost anti-HBsAg antibody concentrations. 
•  Differences in the anti-PRP responses emerged for percentages with anti-PRP antibody 
concentration ≥1.0 μg/ml and the GMCs such that the lowest response was seen in the 
MenC-CRM197 group after the primary doses. This effect of the type of MenC conjugate has been 
noted before in studies in which PRP-T has been given to young infants with different MenC 
conjugates. However, this pattern disappeared after the booster dose when GMCs were 
numerically lower for the MenACWY-TT groups but almost all subjects achieved ≥1.0 μg/ml 
anti-PRP concentration. 
•  Responses to Synflorix, in which 8/10 serotypes are conjugated to Protein D, one to DT (19F) and 
one to TT (18C), showed the expected variability in immune responses by serotype. The lowest 
post-primary responses were to serotypes 5 and 6B and the highest to serotype 14. However, for 
each serotype there were no marked differences in responses between the four treatment 
groups. There were no OPA data generated so it is not known whether the serotype-specific 
difference noted in older children (see the SmPC) would also occur in infancy. After the booster 
dose, concentrations ≥0.35 µg/mL were observed for at least 91.1% of subjects against each 
serotype. The lowest GMC was 0.84 μg/ml (serotype 5 in the MenC-TT group) and the highest 
was 9.75 μg/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As before, the antibody 
concentrations for individual serotypes were broadly similar across the four treatment groups.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In summary, the data support use of Nimenrix from 6 weeks of age. 
There is no advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT in infants and the 2-dose regimen, with at least 
8 weeks between doses, is acceptable. Experience has already demonstrated that a booster dose of MenC 
is needed. It is very reasonable to assume that this also applies to the other meningococcal serogroups. 
Immune responses at M12 are clearly anamnestic and can be expected to prolong protection. As in older 
age groups, for whom a single dose is currently recommended, the need for further doses later in life is 
not yet fully established. However, long term antibody persistence data for MenC suggest that there could 
be a benefit from an additional dose(s) after several years have elapsed. This may apply particularly to 
those who were at the younger end of the age range (e.g. < 5 years old) when first vaccinated. For the 
present, the SmPC should recommend a booster dose of Nimenrix at 12 months of age.  
In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and with 
10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Prior to this variation, the safety profile of Nimenrix in the existing indication was based on a pooled 
analysis on 9,621 subjects who have been vaccinated with one dose of Nimenrix in clinical studies. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 42/61 
 
  
  
pooled analysis includes data for 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 
5 years of age, 990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and 2,326 
adults (18 to 55 years).  
In all age groups the most frequently reported local adverse reactions after vaccination were pain (24.1% 
to 41.3%), redness (15.5% to 35.6%) and swelling (11.3% to 19.9%).  
In the 12-23 months and 2-5 years age groups, the most frequently reported general adverse reactions 
after vaccination were irritability (44.0% and 9.2% respectively), drowsiness (34.1% and 10.8% 
respectively), loss of appetite (26.6% and 8.2% respectively) and fever (17.1% and 8.1% respectively). 
In the 12-14 months age group who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given 2 months apart, the first and 
second doses were associated with similar local and systemic reactogenicity.  
In the 6-10, 11-17 and ≥ 18 years age groups, the most frequently reported general adverse reactions 
after vaccination were headache (15.7%, 22.0% and 21.5% respectively), fatigue (15.6%, 21.9% and 
20.7% respectively), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.3%, 9.4% and 8.3% respectively) and fever (8.0%, 
5.3% and 4.9% respectively).  
In a separate study a single dose of Nimenrix was administered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and 
older. All adverse reactions reported in this study were already observed in younger age groups.  
Study MenACWY-TT-083  
See the description of the study design in section 2.4.1. The collection and analysis of the safety data, 
including the solicited symptoms collected and the grading of AEs, was in accordance with all other 
vaccine studies conducted by GSK in this age group. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2095 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in the study, of which 1052 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of MenACWY-TT (Table 16); 2017 subjects received a booster vaccination, of which 1008 
subjects received MenACWY-TT. Overall, 3601 doses of MenACWY-TT were administered. 
Table 16.  Number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine or control vaccines 
and total number of doses administered 
The study groups were balanced in terms of demographic characteristics (see section 2.4.1). In the 
primary TVC, the mean age at the first vaccination dose was 8.6 weeks, the ratio of female/male showed 
a good balance and was close to 1 (0.99), and the majority of subjects were from White - Caucasian / 
European heritage (94.4%).

AEs in the primary phase 
In the primary phase of the study at least 96.8% of subjects in each treatment group received all their 
assigned doses of study vaccines.  
During the 8-day follow-up period, almost all subjects had at least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited; 
most of which occurred within 4 days and were considered to be vaccine-related) and about one third had 
at least one Grade 3 symptom. Reporting rates were similar or slightly lower with sequential doses.   
Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in all four groups during the 8-day 
post-vaccination period followed by pain and swelling. 
Table 17.  Incidence of solicited local symptoms reported during the 8-days (Days 0-7) post-vaccination 
period following each dose and overall (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort) 
(from table 370 – Module 5.3.5.1 study report body) 
The data shown by individual vaccine indicated that the meningococcal vaccine sites were least likely to 
be associated with local symptoms and the Infanrix hexa sites were more likely than the Synflorix sites to 
be associated with redness and selling.  
Irritability was the most frequently reported (in >80% of subjects) solicited general symptom in all four 
groups during the 8-day post-vaccination period. Grade 3 irritability was reported in about one fifth. Next 
common was drowsiness followed by loss of appetite. Generally the trend was to slightly lower reporting 
rates with sequential doses. Low grade fever was very common. Fever >390C was common, although 
<1% had fever >400C. The pattern did not indicate that higher rates of general symptoms occurred with 
MenACWY-TT compared to the two monovalent MenC groups.

Tabulations are also provided by country but there are too few subjects from Estonia to comment. For 
Germany and Spain the reporting rates for solicited symptoms overall by subject were broadly similar 
between countries.  
At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 52-57% of subjects in each treatment group. Grade 3 
unsolicited AEs were reported in ~3-5% per group, most commonly bronchiolitis, bronchitis, URTI and 
gastroenteritis. Most occurred within the first 4 days of a dose. Overall, the unsolicited AEs were very 
scattered in nature by PT. Skin rashes, collectively, were very common but individual rash types were 
diverse. 
Drug-related AEs were reported for ~2-4% per group, most commonly diarrhoea, vomiting and injection 
site induration. As shown below, these were also scattered in nature. Apart from the AEs associated with 
the injection site it seems unlikely that the others were related to vaccination. The unsolicited AEs of 
epilepsy and hypotonia were both Grade 3 and serious. The case of hypotonia was in the MenC-CRM197 
group. The case of epilepsy occurred in the 3-dose MenACWY-TT group and is discussed below.

AEs in the booster phase to ESFU (6 months post-booster dose) 
All subjects vaccinated in the booster phase received a dose of meningococcal vaccine and all except one 
in the MenC-CRM197 group (99.8%) received the designated additional vaccines. During the 8-day 
follow-up period, at least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited) was reported in 86-89% per group and 
most were considered to be vaccine-related. Grade 3 symptoms were reported in ~22% per group. The 
majority was reported during the 4-day follow-up period.

Redness and pain were the most frequently reported solicited local symptoms in all four groups. Grade 3 
redness was reported in 0.6-1.2% per group but Grade 3 pain was reported in ~4-6%. When viewed by 
vaccine injection site local symptoms were generally less common at the meningococcal vaccine sites 
compared to Infanrix hexa or Synflorix sites.

Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (~58% in each group) with Grade 
3 irritability in 7-9% per group. About one third had fever after the booster dose. Fever >390C was 
common.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths and SAEs 
There were no fatal events reported at any stage of the study. 
Any SAE was reported up to the day preceding the booster dose by ~6-8% per group but none was 
considered vaccine-related. Any SAE was reported from the primary vaccination to the end of the ESFU (6 
months after the booster dose) by ~10% per group. In both cases bronchiolitis and bronchitis 
predominated. 
From study start to one month post-primary vaccination, one subject had an SAE of epilepsy which was 
considered by the investigator to be vaccine related. The onset occurred 7 days after the third dose of 
MenACWY-TT, the subject was hospitalised and was recorded as still recovering at the cut-off date (05 
November 2015). One subject in the MenC-TT group reported four SAEs considered not related to study 
vaccines (bronchitis, elevated AST, ALT and ALP). The subject was hospitalized for 3 days after the onset 
of bronchitis which occurred 37 days after vaccination with Synflorix and Infanrix hexa (dose 2) and this 
resolved. The elevated enzymes occurred 38 and 97 days after vaccination and did not recover/resolve. 
One SAE of febrile convulsion was reported up to the pre-boost visit. This occurred in the 3-dose 
MenACWY group but the onset was several months after the third dose.  
Any SAE was reported from the booster vaccination up to the end of the ESFU by ~3% per group but none 
was considered vaccine-related. There were 3 additional SAEs of febrile convulsion but these cases 
occurred in the monovalent meningococcal conjugate groups.

Laboratory findings 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g. electrocardiograms, X-rays, vital signs) that were judged by the investigator to be 
clinically significant were to be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they met the definition of an AE or SAE.

were to be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other 
abnormal assessments that were associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the 
investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that were present or detected at 
the start of the study and did not worsen, were not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant medications /vaccinations 
In the primary phase intake of concomitant medication(s) was reported for about half the subjects in each 
group during the 8-day post-vaccination period. Although ~35% per group received antipyretic 
medication < 2% received a prophylactic antipyretic. Most of the intake was during the 4-day 
post-vaccination period. During 31 days post-dose use of concomitant medication(s) was reported for 
~60% per group and ~40% received antipyretic medication.

After the booster dose intake of concomitant medication(s) was reported for about one third of subjects 
in each treatment group. About 20% received any antipyretic but < 1% received a prophylactic 
antipyretic. Most use was within 4 days of the dose. Up to 31 days post-booster about 40% had 
concomitant medication(s) and about 25% received any antipyretic.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five subjects withdrew due to an AE or SAE during the primary phase of the study. Two withdrew due to 
SAEs and one withdrew due to an AE in the ACWY_3 group. One subject withdrew due to an SAE in the 
MenC-CRM197 group and one withdrew due to an AE in the MenC-TT group. The three SAEs in two 
subjects leading to withdrawal from the study were considered unrelated to study vaccine and were: 
1)  Apparent life threatening illness/Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) 
2)  Muscle spasms 
3)  RSV bronchiolitis  
No adverse events led to premature discontinuation of the study in the booster phase.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In light of co-administration of the meningococcal conjugate vaccines with Infanrix hexa and Synflorix in 
the primary and booster phases the overall safety profile was not substantially different between the four 
groups since it was driven by the background routine infant immunisations. The profile, including the 
range of unsolicited AEs, was typical of that observed with routine infant and toddler vaccinations and 
reflected what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the monovalent meningococcal 
conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with sequential doses and mostly 
decreased slightly. 
Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC 
vaccines and these, collectively, were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine 
vaccines given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were 
comparable across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high 
and fevers exceeding 390C were common. In this study there was very little use of prophylactic 
anti-pyretic use. There does not seem to be a need to make a specific statement about prophylactic 
anti-pyretic use in the Nimenrix SmPC since this is covered by relevant SmPCs for co-administered

vaccines. Despite the lack of prophylactic anti-pyretics, there was a single febrile convulsion reported in 
a recipient of MenACWY-TT, which occurred a long time after the last dose and was not related.  
With regard to the SAE of epilepsy which was considered by the investigator to be vaccine related and had 
onset 7 days after the third dose of MenACWY-TT, the MAH was asked to report the final outcome and 
provided an updated narrative. The investigators considered that the clinical picture of this boy could be 
due to an infectious disease or an intercurrent illness or could be related to vaccination. The investigator 
reports that the SAE of epilepsy resolved as of 20 October 2012. Whether or not vaccination was a trigger 
remains unsubstantiated. Even if this is the case, it is not possible to determine which vaccine might have 
been causative. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Study MenACWY-TT-083 showed that the overall safety profile was not substantially different between 
the four groups including the range of unsolicited AEs, and it was typical of that observed with routine 
infant and toddler vaccinations, reflecting what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the 
monovalent meningococcal conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with 
sequential doses and mostly decreased slightly. 
Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC 
vaccines and both were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine vaccines 
given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were comparable 
across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high and fevers 
exceeding 390C were common, which was expected due to concomitant vaccinations and lack of use of 
anti-pyretics in the study.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The main SmPC changes are reflected 
below. 
Section 4.11: 
Nimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks 12 months and 
above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135, and 
Y. 
Section 4.2: 
Posology 
Nimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations. 
Infants from 6 to 12 weeks of age 
The recommended immunisation series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant series 
consists of two doses, with the first dose given from 6 weeks of age and with an interval of 2 months 
between doses. The third (booster) dose is recommended at 12 months of age (see section 5.1).  
In section 4.8 the MAH has added a short paragraph on infant data and has amended the table (AEs 
frequencies – see Product Information).   
In addition to the new data included in section 5.1, during the procedure the CHMP recommended that 
section 5.1 be rationalised by age group. For example, all the data for infants, including booster 
responses, are shown in a single table for each of rSBA and hSBA (see Product Information).

Changes were also made to the PI to improve clarity, streamline redundant text and to incorporate 
changes of variations that concluded in parallel (variations II-45 and II-53). These changes were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  As part of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application for Nimenrix, the MAH performed a 
readability test of the Package Leaflet.  
•  An additional patient consultation for the proposed update has not been performed as it is 
considered that the changes in the Package Leaflet are not significant enough to warrant 
additional readability testing. Nimenrix was already intended for use in small children from 1 year 
of age on, with the extension of the indication to infants aged 2 months – 1 year, and from 1 dose 
in over 1’s to 2 doses in infants the PL does change significantly. There is no change to the 
presentation, legal status, active substance or other changes as per the guideline which would 
warrant further consultation with the target patient group at this time.  
• 
Further, the product will be administered by healthcare professionals who are trained to 
administer and follow dosing schedules for vaccines. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
This variation does not impact in any way on the current approval for Nimenrix from the age of 12 
months. Therefore the following sections consider only the new data and benefit-risk in infants when 
Nimenrix is used from 6 weeks of age.   
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The MAH’s study to identify a suitable regimen for use in infants was of adequate design and conduct. The 
inference of efficacy is based on a measure of functional antibody. There is adequate evidence available 
to support this approach and therefore an application based on comparisons of safety and SBA is 
acceptable. There is no appropriate comparator for MenA, W or Y in infants. Use of two MenCC vaccines 
with different conjugating proteins was appropriate. 
The data support use of Nimenrix from 2 months of age. On request, the MAH provided a further 
breakdown of numbers aged 6-8 vs. >8 weeks at the time of the first dose (which showed similar 
proportions above and below 8 weeks) and their immune responses to meningococcal antigens to 
substantiate use from 6 weeks of age.    
This study met all six of the pre-defined elements of the primary analysis, which was conducted in a 
hierarchical fashion using an appropriate non-inferiority margin. In the primary series the rSBA data 
indicated at least comparable responses to MenC between either 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY-TT and the two 
monovalent MenC conjugates. In addition, the data showed that the lower bounds of the 95% CI around 
the differences in percentages with MenC rSBA titres ≥1:8 were actually within -4%. On this basis, either 
of the two infant regimens of Nimenrix could be considered adequate for eliciting satisfactory immune 
responses to MenC. Only at the higher cut-offs, reflecting the differences in GMTs, was there a possible 
advantage for the monovalent MenC vaccines. Even then, >90% in the MenACWY groups had rSBA titres 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/805536/2016 
Page 57/61 
 
  
  
 
≥1:128, hence it seems unlikely that the differences observed are clinically important. The post-primary 
hSBA titres also showed similar results.  
Some of the findings suggested that 2 doses of MenACWY might actually be better than 3 doses. For 
example, rSBA GMTs for MenC were significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the other three 
groups (95% CI did not overlap). Overall, the 2-dose infant regimen of Nimenrix is considered acceptable 
with regard to immune responses to MenC. The rSBA responses to MenA, W and Y did not suggest an 
advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT. In each case very high percentages in both groups had rSBA 
titres ≥1:8 at M3 of the study (i.e. at about 5 months of age). The lower confidence interval limits around 
the percentages with rSBA titres ≥1:8 were >80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also 
applied to percentages with titres ≥1:128 except for MenY in the 3-dose group (76.6%) and MenA in the 
2-dose group (78.2%). There is no comparator but the data support the adequacy of Nimenrix for use in 
infancy. Although descriptive, the hSBA data showed a very similar pattern of post-primary 
between-group comparisons as described for the rSBA data for each meningococcal serogroup. The hSBA 
data demonstrated a greater advantage for 2 vs. 3 doses of MenACWY-TT than the rSBA data.  
Since there is no advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT in infants, the 2-dose regimen, with at least 
8 weeks between doses, is preferable. 
Concerning interactions with other vaccines, the MAH conducted assays of immune responses to 
co-administered antigens for a representative sample from each treatment group, allowing assessing the 
impact of MenACWY-TT compared to MenC-CRM197 or MenC-TT. In addition, since all the data on 
immune responses to meningococcal antigens were obtained against the same background of 
co-administered vaccines, and since responses to MenACWY-TT were satisfactory in comparison to other 
treatment groups, it can be concluded that Nimenrix may be given with DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T and with 
Synflorix. Such data cannot be used to support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with PRP-CRM197 or 
PRP-D constructs or with Prevenar13 in infancy.    
Before and after the booster dose, the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 
3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose 
group with non-overlapping 95% CI. Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar 
proportions with pre- and post-boost titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI 
within -4%. The post-boost GMTs for MenC rSBA were similar for the two MenACWY-TT and 
MenC-CRM197 groups but lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not overlap. This finding is in 
keeping with observations made in other studies with NeisVac-C. However, the MenC responses were 
highly satisfactory for all four groups. All four groups demonstrated an anamnestic response for MenC and 
the two Nimenrix groups demonstrated anamnestic responses for MenA, W and Y, supporting adequate 
priming with 2 or 3 doses in infancy. However, there was no strict control group (i.e. one dose of Nimenrix 
in subjects with no prior vaccination against meningococci) to confirm this supposition. The pre- and 
post-boost hSBA data showed a comparable pattern of post-boost responses vs. rSBA and further 
demonstrated anamnestic immune responses to the final dose of MenACWY-TT.    
Experience has already demonstrated that a booster dose of MenC is needed. It is very reasonable to 
assume that this also applies to the other meningococcal serogroups. Immune responses at M12 are 
clearly anamnestic and can be expected to prolong protection. As in older age groups, for whom a single 
dose is currently recommended, the need for further doses later in life is not yet fully established. 
However, long term antibody persistence data for MenC suggest that there could be a benefit from an 
additional dose(s) after several years have elapsed. This may apply particularly to those who were at the 
younger end of the age range (e.g. < 5 years old) when first vaccinated. For the present, the SmPC should 
recommend a booster dose of Nimenrix at 12 months of age for those initially vaccinated in early infancy.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
As pointed out above, unlike MenC, there is no appropriate comparator for MenA, W or Y in EU infants. 
Therefore it is only possible to observe the titres obtained and interpret them in light of widely held 
assumptions regarding the predictive value of SBA for efficacy. The responses to MenA, W and Y were 
very high and the post-boost responses indicated anamnestic responses (although vaccination of an 
age-matched unvaccinated control group was not done). While the evidence does support use of Nimenrix 
in infants, with a mandatory booster at 12 months of age due to the anticipated waning of titres between 
M4 and M12 of age, the magnitude of the vaccine efficacy that will be conferred cannot be predicted. 
For practical reasons immunogenicity was measured in pre-selected subsets. This is an acceptable 
strategy given the age range studied but it does mean that the available data do reflect subsets. 
As with the monovalent MenCC vaccines and for use of Nimenrix in older age groups, it is not yet known 
whether further booster doses will be needed after the booster dose to be mandated at 12 months of age.  
It is not yet known whether Nimenrix can be given with other possible concomitant vaccines, which poses 
limitations on the routine programmes into which it can fit without adding visits. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
After the primary series, redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in all four 
groups (in ~70% of the subjects) during the 8-day post-vaccination period followed by pain and swelling. 
Irritability was the most frequently reported (in >80% of subjects) solicited general symptom in all four 
groups  during  the  8-day  post-vaccination  period.  Next  common  was  drowsiness  followed  by  loss  of 
appetite. Low grade fever was very common. Fever >390C was common, although <1% had fever >400C. 
In light of co-administration of the meningococcal conjugate vaccines with Infanrix hexa and Synflorix in 
the primary and booster phases the overall safety profile was not substantially different between the four 
groups studied, since it was driven by the background routine infant immunisations. The profile, including 
the range of unsolicited AEs, was typical of that observed with routine infant and toddler vaccinations and 
reflected what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the monovalent meningococcal 
conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with sequential doses and mostly 
decreased slightly. 
Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC 
vaccines and these, collectively, were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine 
vaccines given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were 
comparable across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high 
and fevers exceeding 390C were common. In this study there was very little use of prophylactic 
anti-pyretic use. There does not seem to be a need to make a specific statement about prophylactic 
anti-pyretic use in the Nimenrix SmPC since this is covered by relevant SmPCs for co-administered 
vaccines. Despite the lack of prophylactic anti-pyretic agents there was a single febrile convulsion 
reported in a recipient of MenACWY-TT, which occurred a long time after the last dose and was not 
related. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There was no control group that received only Infanrix hexa and Synflorix for comparison. Nevertheless, 
the comparisons made suggest that the various meningococcal conjugates were not really contributing 
much to the overall safety profiles. 
Just over 1000 subjects received at least one dose of Nimenrix in this study. Since the MAH proposes 2 
rather than 3 doses the safety data from all subjects who received Nimenrix can be taken into account as

relevant. Whereas for a completely new vaccine this safety database for a vaccine potentially to be widely 
used in infants would be considered small, taking into account the wealth of safety information already 
available with Nimenrix itself in older age groups and with MenCC vaccines in infants as well as the actual 
data available there seems to be a sufficient database available. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Based on functional antibody responses, whether measured by rSBA or hSBA, two doses of Nimenrix in 
early infancy since 6 weeks of age with a booster dose at 12 months of age appears to elicit a high 
probability of protection in early life associated with efficient priming of the infant immune system, as 
demonstrated by the anamnestic responses to the booster dose at 12 months of age. For MenC the 
comparable responses observed with Nimenrix vs. licensed monovalent vaccines supports a conclusion on 
efficacy. Whereas the magnitude of protection against MenA, W and Y cannot be predicted from the SBA 
responses, all the available evidence supports a benefit. There is no indication at present that Nimenrix 
presents any additional safety concern over and above the routine infant vaccines with which it will be 
given. 
Conclusion 
Based on the above, the benefit-risk balance of Nimenrix is favourable for use in infants since 6 weeks of 
age in the approved indication.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include a wider paediatric population starting from 6 weeks of age for Nimenrix; 
as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet 
and the RMP (version 6.0) are updated in accordance. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

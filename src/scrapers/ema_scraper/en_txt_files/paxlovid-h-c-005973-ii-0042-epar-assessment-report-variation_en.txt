C4671006 (EPIC-PEP) as well as a supplemental report to Pop PK analysis PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323, 
following the reanalysis of data after the removal of data related to four sites from the Paxlovid data 
analysis. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
GLP/GCP inspections 
This type II variation relies on the outcome of a systematic FDA inspection during the review process of 
the MAA (after the Emergency Use Authorisation). 
2.  Introduction 
Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the coronavirus 19, including the SARS-CoV-2 
Mpro. Inhibition of the Mpro renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads 
to inhibit viral replication. 
Nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir (acting as a PK enhancer) to achieve and maintain 
exposures greater than the in vitro antiviral EC90 throughout the duration of the dosing interval. 
Ritonavir is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and is not expected to have any antiviral activity against 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby 
providing increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir. 
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets; ritonavir tablets) is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults 
who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-
19. 
The recommended oral dose is 300 mg PF-07321332 (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 
100 mg tablet) all taken together orally twice daily (BID) for 5 days. The dose is adjusted to PF-
07321332 (single 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) in patients with moderate 
renal impairment.  
The drug product is available as a film-coated tablets containing PF-07321332 (one single strength 150 
mg) and film-coated tablets containing ritonavir (one single 100 mg strength). 
In the current type II variation, the marketing authorization holder (MAH) proposed to update the Product 
Information removing data from sites with GCP and data anomaly issues following interactions and 
correspondence with US FDA and US FDA site inspections.

3.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
A new Pop PK analysis of nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) was submitted (Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-
1323-Supplement). This analysis follows two type II variations where a Pop-PK model was developed on a 
limited PK dataset, (please refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008, Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323) 
and a full PK dataset (please refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037, Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-Other-
1463). 
Therefore, the methodology used for the PopPK model development and qualification in the current 
submission is the same as previously described as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 and 
EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037 and will not be detailed in this report (full information contained in 
assessment reports for these specific variations). 
Then, in addition to update a previously developed Pop PK model (without PK data from 2 study sites) an 
objective of this analysis was to: 
- 
generate post-hoc predictions of plasma nimatrelvir exposures co-administered with RTV and 
compute secondary PK parameters as Cmin, Cmax and AUC tau at steady state for adults with 
COVID-19 in the EPIC-HR study C4671005 (Study 1005), and 
- 
calculate the percentage of participants achieving Cmin≥ 90% of EC90 for adults with COVID-19 
in the EPIC-HR study 1005. 
3.2.  Results 
In the EPIC-HR study 1005, 71 participants enrolled (48 in 1 site and 23 in another) accounting for n=210 
observations (144 in 1 site and 66 in another) were excluded. 
The total PK dataset consisted of 1166 participants, including 150 healthy subjects from Phase 1 studies 
and 1016 patients from Phase 2/3 study 1005 contributing 4249 PK samples (Table 1).

Table 1: Demographics summary of the Population PK analysis dataset 
Final PK parameter estimates with and without exclusion of subjects are provided in Table 2. In 
comparison to the previous Pop PK model parameter estimates reported in PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 
(refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008), the parameter estimates from the updated Pop PK model with 
exclusion of participants enrolled in the EPIC-HR Study 1005 did not deviate more than 10%.  
The exceptions are for the nCLCR breakpoint (from 70.1 to 84.1 mL/min/1.73 m2), the exponent of the 
power model for nCLCR effect on CL (from 1.05 to 0.812), and IIV in V2 (from 27.3% to 31.7%) and ka 
(60.7% to 69.6%). It is anticipated that these changes would have minimal impact on the nirmatrelvir 
exposure predictions.

Model-based simulations 
The studied dosing regimen nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg BID for 5 days was simulated for 
participants in Study 1005 using the updated Pop PK model and individual’s post hoc PK parameters. 
Table 3 and Table 4 show the predicted nirmatrelvir exposure parameters and the percentage of subjects 
achieving Cmin_EC90 of 292 ng/mL on Day 1 and Day 5. Predictions based on the Pop PK model without 
site exclusions are available in Table 3 and Table 4 for references.

Based on 1016 subjects with their post hoc PK parameters. Excluded participants enrolled at sites in the EPIC-HR 
Study C4671005.  
In comparison to the previous nirmatrelvir exposure predictions for nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg 
reported in PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323, the geometric mean of the predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir 
exposure parameters (Cmin, Cmax, AUCt ) using the updated Pop PK model were higher but within the 
previously reported 10th and 90th percentile range. Similar to the previous predictions, >99% of 
participants in the EPIC-HR Study 1005 following a dose of nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg BID achieve 
Cmin_EC90 of 292 ng/mL on Day 1 after the first dose and on Day 5. 
3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The current report is a supplemental report to PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 and presents the results of 
updating the final PopPK model PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 by removing data from participants 
enrolled in 2 sites in the EPIC HR study 1005.  
Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 was submitted as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008, and the 
CHMP concluded that the developed PopPK model and model-based simulations were not considered 
valid. During this submission several critical issues have been raised (High RUV >100%, High Eta-
shrinkage >50%, biased pcVPC, exclusion of the RUV during the model-based simulations) and remained 
unsolved. As part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037, where an update PopPK model was submitted, 
despite significant efforts made by the applicant, these same several critical issues remained and the 
developed PoPK model was again not considered valid. 
Then, it appears obvious that discarding PK data of 71 subjects from the 2 study sites  of study 1005 
would have minimal impact on both the fixed and random effects, as demonstrated by the applicant with 
less than 10% of deviation between PK parameter estimates (Table 2). Similarly, RUV and eta-shrinkage 
were slightly decreased (RUV of 134% vs 139% and eta-shr > 54% vs 55%) and diagnostic plots were 
not provided.  
In conclusion, given the preceding as part of this submission, the proposed PopPK model and model-
based simulations are not considered valid. Therefore, the MAH was asked, in the first round, to delete 
the predicted exposure metrics at steady-state (model-based simulations) from patients of EPIC-HR 
reported in section 5.2 of the SmPC. This was agreed and the SmPC has been revised according to this 
recommendation.

4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
4.1.  Methods – analysis of submitted data  
The pivotal clinical development for the treatment of non-hospitalized, symptomatic adult participants 
with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illnesses was supported by one Phase 
2/3 trial: Study C4671005 (abbreviated Study 1005). 
During the clinical study conduct of Study 1002, Pfizer conducted an audit and noted that a site not 
reported to the US FDA was used for data collection and that the Principal Investigator’s (PI) oversight of 
the study was inadequate. Pfizer decided to terminate this site for GCP noncompliance and participants 
were transferred to another site. The termination of the site from Study 1002 in common with Study 
1005 was previously communicated in the interim Study 1002 CSR dated 16 June 2022 and in both the 
interim 1005 and in LPLV CSR’s, dated 21 November 2021 and 6 June 2022, respectively submitted to 
the US FDA and EMA. The US FDA also inspected this site and following the inspection requested that all 
clinical and safety data from this site be excluded from Study 1005 and Study 1002 analyses. 
In addition, the US FDA performed a marketing application GCP inspection for studies 1005 and 1002 in 3 
sites . The FDA noted unusual patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and/or COVID-19 symptom diary data 
from these sites. Based on the findings, Pfizer conducted a review of all site data in the Study 1005 and 
Study 1002 to identify unexpected data patterns related to SARS CoV-2 viral RNA, COVID-19 symptom 
data, vital signs, adverse events, laboratory safety data, demographics, PK parameter and ECG 
parameter data. No unusual patterns of symptom diary data were identified. Differences in virology and 
patient symptom data were observed in 1 site. Pfizer performed an in-depth review of the differences and 
noted a level of homogeneity between virology results which could not be biologically explained. The data 
differences in virology and symptom data were assessed and determined to not be the result of vendor or 
technical issues. Pfizer performed a review of safety laboratory data, and this review did not identify any 
concerns. Based on a review of data from all sites, Pfizer identified no additional sites with unusual data 
patterns. 
Following interactions and correspondence with US FDA and US FDA site inspections, a decision was made 
to remove data from the analysis for 2 sites (1 site due to GCP noncompliance and 1 site due to data 
anomaly issues) in Study 1005. Of note, data from the analysis were removed for 4 sites in Study 
C4671002 (abbreviated Study 1002), and 2 sites in Study C4671006.  
Reanalysis of the data was performed without data from the excluded sites (including those participants 
who transferred to another site) for Study 1005. 
4.2.  Results 
The following section presents the main results before and after the exclusion of the sites in order to 
compare the changes removing the data.

Primary analysis: Proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalization or death 
from any cause through Day 28 in mITT 
This analysis was conducted in patients who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive 
COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment and were treated ≤3 days of COVID-19 onset.

4.3.  Discussion 
The pivotal clinical development of Paxlovid was based on a single Phase 2/3 trial conducted in 
participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe disease: Study C467-1005. 
Two additional studies were also conducted by the MAH: Study C4671002 (treatment of participants with 
COVID-19 who are at low risk of progressing to severe illness) and Study C4671006 (preventing 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult household contacts of individuals with symptomatic COVID-
19). These studies are out of the scope of the current indication and did not meet the primary endpoints, 
therefore they are not considered further. 
Following the MAH’s audit of a study site during the conduct of the Study 1002 (this study site was 
common to both Study 1005 and Study 1002), and a US FDA routine marketing application GCP 
inspection for studies 1005 and 1002, 2 sites included in Study 1005 were identified by US FDA as 
presenting major issues. 
Considering that there were no apparent signs towards a systemic nature of the issues identified and that 
it was rather judged that the inadequacy of the study process was confined to the 2 sites, it was decided 
to remove the data from the two sites. This removal was anticipated as being of limited impact on the 
study results considering the total number of sites (2 sites among n=343) and the total number of 
participants (133 participants among N=2246). 
The results after the sites exclusion are largely consistent with the results on the totality of the data, and 
efficacy outcomes are only marginally impacted by removing the data. No case of death was removed 
from the results in mITT as well as in mITT1 (mITT1 is considered as the population of interest). 
However, 2 cases of hospitalization due do COVID-19 were coming from the 2 identified sites in the 
mITT1. Nonetheless, the size effect as well as the 95% confidence interval remain very close: the 
estimated difference from placebo in proportion of participants with COVID-19-related-hospitalization or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/214389/2023 
Page 22/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
death from any cause through day 28 in mITT1 was -5.522 (95%CI: -7.122, -3.923) before sites 
exclusion, and -5.638 (95%CI: -7.308, -3.967) after sites exclusion.  
Therefore, it is acceptable to update the Product Information with results after sites exclusion. However, 
considering that study site was not a stratification factor at randomisation, some blocks of randomisation 
may be incomplete. Thus, the information indicating that data from 2 sites were removed after 
completion of the study should be mentioned in describing Study C4671005 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The datasets used to determine ADR frequencies for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were Studies C4671005 (LPLV), 
C4671002 (LPLV), and C4671006 (LPLV) with data from the aforementioned sites excluded (Section 2.5). 
These 3 data sets consisted of a total of 3515 participants who were treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
and 2585 participants who received placebo. 
The ADR is coded based on MedDRA, Version 25.0. Based on the determination of ADR frequencies with 
the site exclusions and the inclusion of final C4671002 data, the frequencies for Hypersensitivity, 
Anaphylaxis, Dysgeusia, Headache, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain, Malaise, and 
Hypertension have been updated. However, based on these updates there were no changes to frequency 
category for any of the ADRs. 
5.2.  Results 
An overview of the ADR frequencies and categories are provided in Table 6 and Table 7. 
Across the 3 studies, 3515 participants received a dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2585 participants 
received a dose of placebo. The most common adverse reactions (≥1% incidence in the 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group and occurring at a greater frequency than in the placebo group) were 
dysgeusia (5.9% and 0.4%, respectively) and diarrhoea (2.9% and 1.9%, respectively).

5.3.  Discussion 
The safety reanalysis was based on the subjects included in studies C4671005, C4671002, and C4671006 
with data from the aforementioned sites excluded and included a dataset of 3515 subjects treated with 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2585 participants who received placebo. In comparison, the latest safety 
analysis used a safety pool including both studies C4671005, C4671002 and C4671006 with a total of 
3643 participants who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2668 participants who received placebo.

Overall, the safety profile remains consistent between the primary safety analysis and the reanalysis, with 
no changes of frequency category for the ADRs. The impact of the exclusion of the identified sites for the 
analysis of the safety profile of Paxlovid is minor. 
The PI has been slightly modified with the updated ADRs frequencies of dysgeusia (4.6%), diarrhoea 
(3.0%), headache (1.2%) and vomiting (1.2%) based on the frequency reported in the pivotal study 
C4671005, which is endorsed. For consistency with the assessment of the variation II/0026/G (i.e., not 
supporting that the population included in studies C4671005, C4671002 and C4671006 was 
homogeneous considering that study C4671002 targeted a population at standard risk ,and C4671006 a 
population for a post exposure prophylaxis with a treatment duration up to 10 days while the current 
indication is the high risk population with a treatment duration of 5 days, the ADR frequencies of the 
pivotal study C4671005 were used in section 4.8 of the SmPC instead of the pooled safety data for the 
ADRs already identified during the MAA, and the pooled safety data was used for the frequency of new 
emerging ADRs. The safety profile from these 3 studies was comparable which support the use of the 
pooled data for the estimation of ADR frequency for new emerging ADRs. Nevertheless since “vomiting” 
was already identified as an ADR in the pivotal study targeting the intended population and treatment 
duration, the frequency should remain “common”. 
6.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The pivotal clinical development for the treatment of non-hospitalized, symptomatic adult participants 
with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illnesses was supported by one Phase 
2/3 trial: Study C4671005 (abbreviated Study 1005). 
Following interactions and correspondence with the US FDA and US FDA site inspections, a decision was 
made to remove data from the analysis for 2 sites (1 site  due to GCP noncompliance and 1 site  due to 
data anomaly issues) in Study C4671005. 
This Type II variation includes a reanalysis of the data performed without data from the excluded sites 
(including those participants who transferred to another site )  for Study 1005, accordingly with identified 
site by US FDA. 
Similarly, from a clinical pharmacology perspective, the MAH submitted a Pop-PK analysis (Report PMAR-
EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323-Supplement), developed without PK data collected in patients from the excluded 
sites from Study 1005.  
This analysis is an update of a Pop-PK model (Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-1323) submitted as part of 
EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 where the CHMP considered that the Pop-PK model and model-based 
simulations were not valid / reliable. Therefore, the same limitation raised as part of 
EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 remains in this current submission. Consequently, the applicant was asked to 
delete the predicted exposure metrics (model-based simulations) from patients of EPIC-HR reported in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the updated clinical results with excluded sites are consistent with the results submitted at the 
time of the marketing authorization. It is thus agreed to update the Product Information accordingly. The 
MAH was requested to mention the sites exclusion in section 5.1 of the SmPC. This reference was 
included.

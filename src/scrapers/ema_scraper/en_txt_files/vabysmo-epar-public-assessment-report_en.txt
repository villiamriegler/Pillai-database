2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant has submitted an application for marketing authorisation for the following indications for 
the treatment of adult patients with: 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic, progressive, multifactorial disease of the macula 
and a leading cause of central vision loss among people over the age of 50 years. nAMD (also known 
 
as macular or choroidal neovascularisation [CNV] secondary to AMD) is a form of advanced AMD that 
causes rapid and severe vision loss. It is characterised by the abnormal proliferation of new blood 
vessels within the retina, or in the subretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) spaces. 
These neovascular membranes leak fluid, lipids, and blood into the outer retina often causing severe, 
irreversible loss of central vision if left untreated. 
DME is the most common complication as well as a leading cause of central vision loss in patients with 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and can develop at any stage of DR severity, with increasing frequency as 
the underlying disease worsens. DME and DR are forms of the same underlying pathophysiological 
processes subsequent to microvasculopathy that is driven by hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. 
Approximately half of patients with DME will lose two or more lines of visual acuity within 2 years if left 
untreated. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
nAMD  
The prevalence of nAMD increases with age, with estimates in the United States in 2011 ranging from 
0.5% among people 65-69 years old to 14.6% among those 90 years old or older (Rudnicka et al. 
2012). Of the estimated 253 million people worldwide with visual impairment, more than 10 million 
(4.1%) were caused by AMD. 
In the future, the global population aged 60 years and older is projected to increase dramatically, 
resulting in a significant increase in the prevalence of nAMD from 23.47 million in 2010 to 80.44 million 
by 2050. 
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) 
DME affects 21 million people around the world, including 12% of people with Type 1 diabetes and 
28% of those with Type 2 diabetes. In patients diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes before the 
age of 30, the prevalence of DR reaches 97% when diabetes duration exceeds 15 years. 
Eventually, nearly all patients with diabetes will develop some form of retinopathy (ADA 2013; Postel 
et al. 2013). In 2019, the worldwide population of people living with diabetes was approximately 463 
million, and this is estimated to grow to 548 million by 2045 (Saeedi et al. 2019). The global burden of 
DME and DR is expected to increase significantly with considerable public health, socioeconomic, and 
quality-of-life consequences due to the combined impact on patients, caregivers, family members, and 
HCPs. 
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the central portion of the retina 
(the macula) that results primarily in loss of central vision. AMD can be classified as dry or wet 
(neovascular AMD). Dry AMD progressed to nAMD in a minority of patients.  
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) (also known as choroidal neovascularisation or 
wet AMD) causes rapid and severe visual loss. It is a leading cause of visual impairment in older 
people. Several biochemical and biological processes, including angiogenesis, oxidative stress and 
inflammation are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of nAMD, which is characterised by the 
abnormal growth of new blood vessels in the subretinal space usually from the choroidal circulation.  
These new vessels leak leading to collections of subretinal fluid or blood.  
 
nAMD can be subcategorized, based upon the pattern of choroidal neovascularisation seen 
in fluorescein angiography, into classic, occult, or fibrous lesions. Lesions that are predominantly 
classic typically progress more rapidly. 
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is regarded as the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and 
can occur as a complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Diabetic macular oedema (DME) is the 
most common complication of DR and is a leading cause of central vision loss in DR patients. DME can 
develop at any stage of DR severity, with increasing frequency as the underlying disease worsens. 
Approximately half of patients with DME will lose two or more lines of visual acuity within 2 years if left 
untreated. 
The underlying pathophysiological process of DME and DR is a loss of pericytes, development of retinal 
micro-aneurysms, dilated capillaries and vascular inflammation which lead to an increase in vascular 
permeability. 
The diagnosis of DR is based on the detection and clinical manifestations of microvascular 
abnormalities in the retina. DME is characterised by intraretinal fluid in the macular area.  NPDR is 
characterized by microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, exudates, retinal nerve fibre layer infarcts 
and, in more severe cases, venous beading and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. PDR is 
characterised by neovascularisation that can be detected anywhere on the retina, optic disc or in the 
anterior segment.  
The excess of Ang-2 and VEGF in the vitreous of patients with diabetic eye disease was shown to 
correlate with disease severity, and is thought to mediate vessel destabilisation, vascular leakage, 
inflammation and, in later stages of disease, neovascularisation. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
nAMD  
Patients with nAMD usually present with a visual impairment and can have sudden changes in vision. 
The condition is diagnosed based on results of a slit lamp examination, fluorescein angiography and 
optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
The symptoms of nAMD include central vision loss characterized by metamorphopsia, scotomas, and 
blurriness, which negatively affect reading, driving, patient mobility, face recognition, and other daily 
activities, including self-care. The diagnosis of nAMD is made clinically by ophthalmoscopy and 
multimodal retinal imaging techniques, which include optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus 
fluorescein angiography (FFA). The clinical manifestation of nAMD includes the presence of subretinal 
fluid (SRF) and/or intraretinal fluid (IRF), retinal and subretinal hemorrhage, retinal thickening, and 
pigment epithelial detachment. Without treatment, progression of the disease results in the formation 
of a fibrous scar and consequently severely reduced vision. 
DME 
On a molecular level, DME and DR are characterized by hypoxia-mediated release of pro-angiogenic, 
hyperpermeability, and pro-inflammatory mediators in the retina, with Ang-2 and VEGF-A playing the 
key role. 
 
The excess of Ang-2 and VEGF in the vitreous of patients with diabetic eye disease was shown to 
correlate with disease severity, and is thought to mediate vessel destabilization, vascular leakage, 
inflammation and, in later stages of disease, neovascularization. 
The diagnosis of DR is based on the detection and clinical manifestations of microvascular 
abnormalities in the retina. NPDR is characterized by microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, 
exudates, retinal nerve fibre layer infarcts and, in more severe cases, venous beading and intraretinal 
microvascular abnormalities. PDR is characterized by neovascularization that can be detected 
anywhere on the retina, optic disc or in the anterior segment. 
2.1.5.  Management 
nAMD 
The major goal of treatment is to avoid or recover lost vision and subsequently maintain vision in 
nAMD patients over time. Previously, laser photocoagulation therapy and photodynamic therapy with 
verteporfin were the standard of care and were shown to stabilize, but not recover, vision.  
The introduction of anti-VEGF therapies has markedly improved vision outcomes and changed the 
management of nAMD. 
The anti-VEGF therapies ranibizumab (Lucentis), aflibercept (Eylea), and brolucizumab (Beovu) are 
approved and used for the treatment of nAMD in the United States and European Union. 
The introduction of anti-VEGF therapy has resulted in an improvement of vision outcomes in patients 
with nAMD. However, for most patients, the current treatment paradigm involves frequent health care 
provider (HCP) visits and intravitreal injections in order to maintain vision gains (Heier et al. 2012; 
Maguire et al. 2016). This imposes a considerable burden on patients, their families, caregivers, and 
the healthcare system (Jaffe et al. 2018). 
Real-world data show that many patients with nAMD do not receive treatment as the perlabel 
recommended frequency, and the under-treatment in clinical practice may result in lower visual acuity 
gains compared with those observed in the clinical trials.  
Although anti-VEGF therapy is the current mainstay of treatment, nAMD is a multifactorial disease with 
VEGF being only one of the key drivers; sustained efficacy over time with fewer injections may be 
achievable by targeting additional drivers of angiogenesis such as Ang-2. In addition, nAMD has an 
inflammatory component not completely addressed by anti-VEGF treatments alone. New and more 
durable treatments that target additional pathways to those mediated by VEGF are therefore required, 
in order to provide visual acuity outcomes with less frequent dosing that are at least as good as those 
achieved with more frequent anti-VEGF monotherapy regimens. 
DME 
The primary treatment goals in DME are improving or maintaining visual acuity, reducing retinal fluid, 
improving the underlying diabetic retinopathy and preventing irreversible damage to the macula. One 
of the factors found to be elevated in intraocular fluids in animal models of diabetic eye disease and in 
patients with diabetic eye disease is VEGF, a key mediator of both vascular leakage and growth of new 
vessels. 
Macular laser used to be the standard of care for treatment of DME, however the development of anti-
VEGF therapy in the last decade has led to dramatic improvements in visual outcomes for patients with 
DME. Other available approved options for the treatment of DME include periocular or intravitreal 
steroids and steroid implants which have the limitations of severe side effects such as cataract and 
glaucoma. 
The availability of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments enabled robust improvements in visual outcomes 
accompanied by robust improvements in the underlying DR severity in patients with DME and DR 
severity improvements with anti-VEGF treatments were enabled also in patients with DR, with or 
without DME (Antoszyk et al. 2020). Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is approved for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME and the treatment of patients with PDR (with or without DME) in the European 
Union. Aflibercept (Eylea) is approved for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME in the 
European Union. Although intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of patients with DME and 
DR represent major advances, there is still an unmet need for improved therapies in these diseases. 
In the real world, a significant proportion of DME patients treated with approved therapies do not 
experience clinically meaningful improvements in vision or are unable to maintain their initial vision 
gains long-term due to a need for frequent HCP visits for injections or monitoring (Souied et al. 2015; 
Stefanickova et al. 2018; Shimura et al. 2020; Naujokaitis and Balaciuniene 2021). 
Given the multifactorial pathogenesis of DME and DR, treatments targeting additional pathways beyond 
VEGF are needed to comprehensively address the underlying pathology and to provide more durable 
efficacy which could reduce the burden of frequent HCP visits and intravitreal injections in these 
patients.

active substance. Each vial contains 28.8 mg faricimab in 0.24 mL solution. This provides a usable 
amount to deliver a single dose of 0.05 mL solution containing 6 mg of faricimab.  
Other ingredients are: L-histidine, acetic acid, L-methionine, polysorbate 20, sodium chloride, D-
sucrose, water for injections.   
The product is available in vial with a coated rubber stopper sealed with an aluminum cap with a yellow 
plastic flip-off disk and it is co-packaged with a blunt transfer filter needle (18-gauge x 1½ inch, 1.2 
mm x 40 mm). Pack size of 1 vial and 1 transfer filter needle. The user is instructed to transfer the 
finished product from the vial into a disposable injection syringe, which is not included in the package.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The active substance (INN faricimab) is a recombinant bispecific antibody produced in Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells and consists of two different heavy chains (452 amino acid residues and 462 amino 
acid residues) and two different light chains (214 amino acid residues and 213 amino acid residues) 
with inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds, that are typical for IgG1 antibodies plus an additional 
disulfide bridge in the CH3-CH3 interface.  
To enforce heterodimerisation of the two different heavy chains, several point mutations were 
introduced (“knobs into holes”). Exchange of CH1 and CL domains in the Ang-2 binding Fab promotes 
the correct assembly of the two different light chains, known as the “CrossMAb approach”. 
 
Modification of faricimab neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding sites 
disables the antibody’s Fc-mediated effector functions.  
The Fc domain of each heavy chain contains one N-linked glycosylation site at the conserved Asn297 
according to Kabat et al. 1991, at Asn303 for HC1 and Asn313 for HC2, respectively, according to the 
faricimab amino acid sequence numbering. 
Faricimab is a next generation antibody with a dual action that targets not one but two pathways 
involved in angiogenesis/vascularisation/inflammation and retinal vessel destabilisation in the eye. 
Faricimab selectively binds with high affinity to VEGF-A and Ang-2 thereby preventing binding of VEGF-
A and Ang-2 to its receptors. Binding of VEGF-A and Ang-2 to their receptors results in retinal vessel 
destabilization, inflammation, endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularisation and vascular leakage, 
which mediate onset and progression of neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration 
(nAMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema (DME). The mechanism of action of 
faricimab works through the interference with the ligand-receptor binding process in Ang-2 and VEGF 
pathways that play a key role in these retinal diseases. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The active substance is manufactured by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany. 
The active substance manufacturing site, testing sites, cell bank preparation, testing and storage sites 
are listed in the application. Valid manufacturing authorisations and/or Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) certificates are available for all active substance manufacturers. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Faricimab is produced using a suspension-adapted CHO cell line. Up-stream manufacturing of faricimab 
active substance starts with thawing of 1 vial of working cell bank (WCB) followed by serial culture 
expansion from agitated flasks through 1) seed train bioreactors and 2) inoculum train cultures to the 
3) production bioreactor. The seed train culture is used to provide a continuous source of cells for the 
production of multiple batches from a thaw of the WCB.. The production culture is harvested by 
separating the secreted molecule in the cell culture fluid (CCF) from cells and cell debris by 
centrifugation and filtration. The filtered harvest cell culture fluid (HCCF) hold time and conditions are 
properly validated. From each production run, a single batch of HCCF is produced, which can be traced 
back to the WCB thaw used to initiate the manufacturing process. Critical process parameters (CPPs) 
and non-CPPs with acceptance ranges are determined and summarised, in-process control (IPC) output 
parameters and acceptance/action limits are indicated. 
The faricimab purification process consists of chromatography steps and additional steps for removal 
and inactivation (low pH and viral retention filtration) of potential viral contaminants. The final step in 
the active substance purification process is concentration of the product and buffer exchange using 
ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UFDF). Protein concentration and buffer composition are adjusted to the 
active substance specification by addition of a stock solution containing histidine/acetic acid buffer, 
sodium chloride, sucrose, methionine and polysorbate 20. The active substance solution is filtered into 
appropriate storage containers. 
Faricimab is fully formulated at active substance level, no further formulation takes place during 
finished product manufacture. 
CPPs/non-CPPs and IPCs were determined based on defined quality target product profile and critical 
quality attributes, process characterization, and criticality assessment of process parameters and 
attributes. The classification of the process parameters and their acceptable ranges are adequately 
justified. IPCs with action limits or acceptance criteria are implemented at critical steps. In conclusion, 
the process parameters and IPCs in combination with the other control measures appear appropriate to 
ensure quality and safety of faricimab as well as to monitor process consistency. Batch numbering 
system allows proper traceability of the manufacturing process of the active substance. 
Pre-harvest Cell Culture Fluid (PHCCF) is sampled for appropriate IPCs for microbial control; 
appropriate microbial safety tests are performed throughout the purification process, with appropriate 
action/acceptance limits.  
Chromatography processes are described sufficiently. Number of cycles needed for processing one 
batch is stated, critical and non-critical process parameters with acceptable ranges are determined. 
Resin reuse limits are determined, and the selected validation approach is acceptable. Materials and 
types of UFDF membranes are listed. Appropriateness of the sanitisation, regeneration and storage 
procedures have been demonstrated. There are multiple filtration steps using 0.2 µm filters in the 
purification process. Reprocessing conditions are specified in the dossier. Refiltration has been 
appropriately validated. Type of the virus filter is stated and the filter is tested for integrity prior to and 
after use. Information about the integrity test method and the acceptance criterion is provided. Actions 
taken in case of failure are described in the Applicant’s quality system. 
Hold times have been established for the in-process pools based on biochemical and microbial hold 
time studies. Defined hold times are adequately justified by hold time studies. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. There 
are no raw materials of human/animal origin or any directly derived non-animal biological material 
used in the manufacturing process.  
The generation of the production cell line and the expression vectors has been described in detail. 
Faricimab is manufactured in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line which is regarded as well 
established. Sufficient details have been provided on the source and history of the cell substrate. The 
preparation of the expression constructs for the different antibody chains has been appropriately 
described and vector maps have been provided. 
Cell line development, clonality, source, history, generation and composition of the Cell Substrate is 
described adequately. The cell bank system is composed of the MCB and the WCB and is appropriately 
qualified by characterization and testing according to relevant guidelines Test methods performed to 
confirm identity, microbial, viral and retroviral safety as well as genetic stability of master cell bank 
(MCB), WCB and Cells at limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) are described. Results demonstrate that no 
changes to the faricimab DNA sequences have occurred during the establishment of the cell bank 
system and the production process. Cell viability and MCB and WCB stability are suitably addressed.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
IPC tests and limits applied to the cell culture and purification process steps are summarized in tabular 
format. Depending on criticality, IPCs are tested against defined action limits or acceptance criteria. 
Appropriate IPC tests including for microbial control are conducted throughout the manufacturing 
process with action limits. Acceptance criteria is determined for safety relevant parameters where 
conformance is required for release.. The IPCs and their acceptance criteria/action limits are 
considered adequate.  
No intermediates are defined for the faricimab active substance manufacturing process. 
 
Process validation 
The process validation/characterisation approach described in the dossier includes: 1. A process impact 
assessment (based on the outcome of the scale-down model (SDM) studies, linkage studies, large 
scale data from manufacturing scale runs, and hold time studies a process risk score is defined for 
CQAs), 2. PPQ batches, 3. Small-scale studies (Design of experiment (DOE) studies to identify CPPs, 
non-CPPs and acceptable ranges), 4. Qualification of scale-down models, 5. Process linkage studies for 
reduction/clearance of impurities/variants, 6. Validation of hold times, 7. Evaluation of raw material 
removal and leachables, 8. Validation of re-use of chromatography resins and ultrafiltration 
membranes, 9. Shipping qualification studies, 10. Validation of active substance re-filtration. 
An appropriate number of  consecutive batches from independent thaws of the WCB were 
manufactured at the commercial active substance manufacturing site in accordance with pre-approved 
protocols and according to the commercial process, scale, and control procedures. A subset of batches 
were manufactured at the limit of in vitro cell age.  
For the at scale qualification, Quality Attributes (QAs) were assessed. PPQ results are provided for all 
individual process steps and phases for process parameters as well as for process attributes/IPCs and 
for release testing. All process validation data are within the pre-defined ranges/acceptance 
criteria/specifications, including the critical parameters and attributes (CPPs, CPAs and CQAs). For the 
product related impurities, data show consistent reduction throughout the purification steps across all 
batches. 
Process Parameter (PP) Ranges for the upstream and downstream manufacturing steps, like 
chromatography steps and additional steps for removal and inactivation of potential viral 
contaminants,  were evaluated in small scale studies.. PP Acceptable Ranges were set to ensure that 
each CQA is within the in-process pool limit (IPPL). A Risk Ranking and Filtering (RRF) assessment 
(based on development data and prior knowledge) was completed for each unit operation to assess the 
criticality of all PPs. Based on the outcome of the RRF, multifactor and single-factor studies were 
planned and evaluated using DOE concepts in the determination of CPPs. The SDMs were suitably 
qualified. 
In-process hold time validation includes microbial and biochemical validations. Validation is ongoing. 
Upon completion of the hold time validation, the Applicant intends to submit a corresponding Type IB 
variation.  
Resin lifetime and re-use studies are ongoing and have been verified at manufacturing scale. The 
small-scale data and the available data from large-scale manufacture support the proposed lifetimes 
and regeneration/sanitisation procedures for resins.  
Shipment of faricimab active substance from Roche Penzberg, Germany for long-term storage and to 
the finished product manufacturing site has been validated.  
Overall, the process validation results demonstrate that the process performed consistently and 
removal of impurities is generally considered adequately demonstrated. 
Manufacturing process development 
During development, different versions of the faricimab active substance manufacturing process were 
used.. Process steps/process parameters of the different processes are compared in tabular format, 
and rationale of the changes are provided and are deemed sufficient.   All phase III clinical and the 
PPQ batches were manufactured at the commercial active substance manufacturing facility at 
commercial scale,. The potential impact of the manufacturing changes on product quality was assessed 
in an extensive comparability program that included routine analytical and extended characterisation of 
the biological and physicochemical properties of faricimab active substance as well as comparative 
stress stability studies. The earlier developmental batches were also tested for comparability. Routine 
analysis results show that batches are consistent in terms of purity, potency, identity, and that all 
process versions have sufficient clearing capacity of impurities. 
The same production cell line was used throughout development,  
In conclusion, the process comparability exercise performed on the different developmental batches 
confirms that neither the process changes introduced during clinical development nor the changes 
introduced between the phase III clinical and PPQ batches are expected to adversely affect the activity 
and safety of the post-change materials.  
Characterisation 
Faricimab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-
of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a IgG1-type 
antibody derived from CHO cells.  
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size 
and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. 
The approach to confirm the primary structure of faricimab is acceptable. Molecular mass figures 
corresponded with the expected mass figures of the main glycoforms, mass figures obtained showed 
close correspondence with the expected heavy- and light- chain masses. Peptide map analysis 
confirmed the theoretically expected amino acid sequences for each of the four different polypeptide 
chains. N-and C-terminal variants were quantitated by the peptide map analysis. The Applicant 
conducted peptide map analysis to detect sequence variants. The expected disulphide bonds were 
identified.  
A study of active substance steric structure was conducted. Taken together the data in the original 
MAA and in the response, it may be reasonably assumed that faricimab is similar to the known IgG1 
type mAbs by overall structure. 
The N-glycosylation analysis presented is considered satisfactory; the glycosylation pattern is similar to 
that of other CHO-derived mAbs. Non-human carbohydrate structures have not been identified. 
Stress studies were used to gain an insight into post translational modifications such as oxidation, 
deamidation. 
Analysis of the active substance revealed a low abundance of high molecular weight (HMW) and low 
molecular weight (LMW) components. The formation of HMW and LMW components was found to 
impact biological activity. Charge variants have been analysed and been assigned to structural variants 
by various techniques.  
An isoelectric point figure has been determined.  
An extinction coefficient was also determined for faricimab.  
Functional characterisation of faricimab included an assay to measure the anti-Ang-2 potency and a 
reporter gene assay to measure anti-VEGF potency. Both the assays are part of active substance as 
well as finished product release specification. A full description of the assays as well as justification of 
method choice have been provided. The faricimab treatment of ophthalmopathic patients is aimed at 
inhibiting vascular proliferation, therefore the anti-proliferation capacity of the active substance is to be 
explored.  
Size -, and charge-related variants as well as stressed samples (the preparation of stressed samples 
was described) were assessed for functional activity. 
Characterisation: assessment of critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
A separate sub-section has been devoted to the definition of CQA-s within S.3. QAs have been 
reviewed to decide whether CQA-assessment is applicable.. Criticality was assessed by a procedure 
called risk ranking and filtering (RRF). In this procedure, impact and uncertainty scores were assessed 
on bioactivity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety, taking clinical and non-clinical 
experience, physicochemical and biological characterisation, general knowledge on antibodies and 
published literature into account.  
No high or medium impact attribute was identified for immunogenicity. The Applicant used clinical data 
for justification, namely the lack of finding ADAs with an impact on PK, efficacy or safety.  
Based on the favourable safety profile of faricimab recorded during phase II and phase III clinical 
studies, no high or medium impact attribute was identified with respect of safety.  
The potential synergistic effects of quality attributes as well as interactions that have been associated 
with potential stability issues have also been addressed. 
In general, the definition of CQAs is considered approvable. 
Impurities 
The Applicant did not distinguish between product-related substances and product-related impurities 
referring to difficulties in isolating the individual variants. Nevertheless, in certain cases) a low 
biological activity was reported for some variants. These ones might have been identified as impurities. 
As CQAs have been defined for the variants with defective potency, they are controlled. 
Concerning process-related impurities, characterisation and removal of these impurities are described.  
Elemental impurities are discussed in connection with the active substance container-closure system. 
Only acetic acid is discussed as residual solvent, its removal is also described. Ethanol levels found in 
the PPQ batches are well below the acceptable limit. For control of potential contaminants (adventitious 
agents) refer to section below.  
2.2.2.3.  Specification  
The active substance release specification includes general tests, test for identity, purity and impurity 
tests, test for protein content, potency by bioassays(anti Ang-2 assay and anti VEGF reporter gene 
assay) , polysorbate 20, including appropriate microbial safety tests.   
Tightening of some criteria in the specification was undertaken during the procedure.  
Analytical methods 
Description of the analytical tests as well as their validation and the justification of specification is 
found in section P.5  
Two bioassays serve as quantitative in vitro assays to determine potency of faricimab active substance 
and finished product. The anti-Ang-2 functionality of faricimab is measured in a cell-based assay. The 
anti-VEGF functionality of faricimab is measured in a cell-based VEGF reporter gene assay. 
Batch analysis 
Data for all the available active substance batches has been provided. Genealogy of the batches 
starting from the cell bank origin is presented. Results on all the batches meet the specification in 
 
 
effect by the time of testing. Test results on the four PPQ batches meet the proposed commercial 
release specification criteria as well.   
Reference materials 
The same Reference Standards were used for active substance and finished product. Refer to the 
respective finished product section. 
Container closure system 
The active substance is stored in specified bags. A description of the active substance container, 
closure component (cap/seal), and technical drawing of the container are presented. Vendor certificate 
and irradiation certificate have been provided. . The active substance storage container is in 
compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.1.7.  
Extractables study has been conducted by the vendor, the results are briefly summarised. A leachables 
study has been initiated and continued throughout the active substance shelf life.. 
So far, the study did not reveal any leachable posing a potential risk. The Applicant committed to 
submit full results of the study upon completion (recommendation 1). 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
A shelf life and storage conditions were proposed for the active substance.  
The long term stability study results include data on an appropriate number of clinical and PPQ 
batches.. All the results are within specification. The comparability of the clinical batches to the PPQ 
batches has been demonstrated. In view of the storage conditions and the stability profile of faricimab 
active substance, the claimed shelf life can be granted.  
Accelerated stability study revealed an increase in the HMW species as well as an increase in thebasic 
component.  
The Applicant committed to include at least one commercial active substance batch per year if 
commercial production occurs during the calendar year.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Faricimab finished product is provided as a sterile, colourless to brownish-yellow solution for injection. 
The finished product is formulated as 120 mg/mL faricimab. Each single-use vial contains 28.8 mg of 
faricimab at target pH 5.5, and it is designed to deliver 6 mg of faricimab. The manufacturing fill 
parameters were selected so as to deliver the net quantity (nominal fill volume) declared on the label.  
The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial with a fluororesin-laminated butyl rubber 
stopper and crimped with an aluminum seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap.  
The faricimab finished product is co-packaged with 1 blunt transfer filter needle (Becton Dickinson 18 
G 1 × 1/2’’stainless steel transfer filter needle 5 µm; filter material: acrylic copolymer). 
Formulation development 
The finished product formulation is identical to the active substance formulation. L-histidine and acetic 
acid used for buffering, L-methionine as stabiliser, sodium chloride and D-sucrose are used as tonicity 
 
agents, and polysorbate 20 used as surfactant as well as to minimise formation of aggregates. The 
formulation does not contain any preservatives. The rationale used to select the excipients was 
sufficiently described in the dossier. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. 
Four different finished product formulation were used during faricimab development . Changes in 
formulation during development were sufficiently described. The rationale used to select the final 
composition has been described in the dossier. The proposed commercial finished product formulation 
is identical to the formulation used in phase III clinical trials. A multivariate formulation robustness 
study was performed, and it demonstrated that the formulation ensures the finished product stability 
during manufacture, storage, transportation and administration. 
Considering that faricimab is an ophthalmologic product and developed for intravitreal injection, the 
number of particles is of special interest. No visible particles have been detected in finished product so 
far. The Ph. Eur does not set specific limits for subvisible particulates in ophthalmologic products. 
Faricimab finished product is intended to use with a transfer filter needle. The effectiveness of filter 
was demonstrated using polystyrene beads in formulation buffer, faricimab finished product and 
surrogate protein formulation.  The use of filter needle is mandatory, and this is appropriately reflected 
in the SmPC. The filter needle is co-packed with the finished product. The control of subvisible 
particulates is considered acceptable. 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process includes thawing and optional refreeze of active 
substance, pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction and sterile filtration, filling, stoppering, capping 
and crimping. The finished product is stored at 2°C-8°C.  
Different finished product manufacturing processes were used during development. The manufacturing 
site was also changed. Processes used for manufacture of batches used during phase 3 pivotal studies 
and PPQ batches have been described. 
A comprehensive comparability exercise was performed on finished product batches to account for 
changes between the development finished product process and the finished product proposed 
commercial process. The comparability exercise included quantitative comparison with predefined 
comparability acceptance criteria, qualitative comparability assessment of chromatograms and 
electropherograms, and stress stability studies. In general, the studies demonstrated comparable 
quality of materials. The results are in line with the finding of the active substance comparability 
exercise and demonstrate improved quality of the PPQ batches compared to phase III material with 
respect to main peak purity. 
Overall, comparability data demonstrated that the material derived from the clinical trials and PPQ 
process- finished products were comparable.  
The finished product does not contain any overages. Minimal fill volume was defined based on the 
results of user handling study. The minimum fill volume ensures that the appropriate dose (0.05 mL) 
can be withdrawn. 
Compatibility of active substance with container closure system and devices used for administration 
was demonstrated. Extractable and leachable studies were conducted, and no risk was identified. 
Leachable studies are still ongoing. . The Applicant committed to provide data from ongoing leachables 
studies and any new leachables not previously identified will be reported to EMA (recommendation 2). 
In-use stability of finished product was assessed using representative injection syringes, equipped with 
transfer needle.  The results demonstrated that finished product in simulated intravitreal administration 
is physically and chemically stable under the tested conditions.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacture, release and stability testing sites are specified in the dossier. The 
finished product is released by Roche Pharma AG, Germany. GMP certificates were provided for the 
finished product sites. Batch formula is appropriately presented for minimum and maximum batch 
sizes. 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing, pooling and mixing of active substance, bioburden 
reduction and sterile filtration, filling, stoppering and capping. The thawed active substance may be 
optionally refrozen. The vials are visually inspected before labelling and secondary packaging (including 
co-packaging with filter needle). The finished product is stored at 2-8°C. Vials and stoppers are 
sterilised by the finished product manufacturer. Manufacturing process is briefly described.   
Summary of critical, non-critical process parameters, and hold times are presented. Acceptable ranges 
were defined for CPPs and non-CPPs.  In-process controls include bioburden, bacterial endotoxin, filter 
integrity (for bioburden reduction filtration and sterile filtration), fill volume and visual inspection. 
Acceptance criteria or action limits were defined for in-process controls and are in compliance with 
guideline requirements and Ph. Eur.  
The consecutive finished product PPQ batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
site.. PPQ results are provided for all individual process steps for both process parameters and in-
process controls. All data comply with the pre-defined acceptance criteria. PPQ batches demonstrated 
that the finished product can be consistently manufactured within predefined processing parameters. 
A risk assessment (RFF) was used to identify critical process attributes and parameters and to design 
the process design studies. The risk assessment and the scoring system is considered appropriate. 
Process design studies were performed to support the proposed process parameters, process and hold 
times. Process parameters were classified as CPPs or non-CPPs based on the observed impact on 
relevant CQAs in the process design studies and acceptable ranges were defined.. Aseptic filling has 
been validated. Hold times were justified from microbial perspective.  All maximum hold times are 
sufficiently covered through either process design or PPQ studies.  
In general, the PPQ batch data presented, in addition to the release and stability data of the PPQ 
batches along with the process design studies, confirm that all CQA met the acceptance criteria and 
the IPCs met their acceptance criteria or limits, respectively. All CPPs and non-CPPs were within their 
acceptable ranges and process performance was consistent between the PPQ batches. The finished 
product manufacturing process is considered thoroughly validated. 
Supply chain and shipping system of finished product were sufficiently described. Several studies have 
been performed to ensure that shipment of faricimab finished product is adequate from a thermal and 
mechanical perspective. Validation for the depyrogenation and sterilisation of vials as well as for the 
sterilization of stoppers are described sufficiently and performed in accordance with EMA guideline. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification  
The finished product release specification includes general tests, test for identity , purity and impurity 
tests, test for protein content , test for polysorbate 20 content , potency by bioassays (anti Ang-2 
assay and anti VEGF reporter gene assay)  , as well as tests for safety, including entoxin and sterility .   
Justification of active substance and finished product release and shelf-life specifications was provided. 
The Applicant used information from clinical experience, manufacturing history and stability studies for 
establishment of acceptance criteria.  
 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.  
Finally, the nitrosamine risk assessment has been provided. The assessment has been carried out for 
the manufacturing process, active substance, excipients (including water for injections) and primary 
packaging materials, as required. It is agreed that the risk assessment shows that the risk of 
formation/introduction of nitrosamine impurities for the entirety of the finished product is negligible. 
Analytical methods 
The list of analytical methods is considered adequate.. Test method identification numbers are 
provided. The analytical procedures used in routine testing of active substance and finished product 
were described in sufficient details. Validation reports covering all the non-compendial methods have 
been submitted. Batch analyses results of all finished product batches were provided.  
Batch analysis 
All batch analysis results meet the specifications that were in effect at the time of testing and release 
for each batch. In addition, all available release data from the finished product batches produced 
during the PPQ campaign meet the commercial release specification acceptance criteria. 
Reference materials 
A two-tiered reference system was prepared from the same active substance batch, using the same 
procedure for the primary (pRS) and the secondary (sRS) reference standard. This active substance 
batch was produced with a manufacturing procedure, which is considered representative of the 
commercial procedure. The secondary RS was appropriately characterized, including release methods 
as well as extended characterization. The same RS was used for the active substance and for the 
finished product. Potency of sRS is equivalent to former RSs.  
The list of RSs used in clinical development is provided, along with their qualification history.  Future 
RS will be prepared and characterized according to the defined protocol. In the response to day 120 
questions, the Applicant committed that defined additional testsare going to be included in the testing 
panel when either a new primary reference standard or an updated RS testing protocol is going to be 
submitted for post marketing approval (recommendation 3). 
Reference standard storage conditions are suitably defined.The stability of secondary RS is tested 
annually, which is adequate. After having the current secondary RS replaced, stability testing of the 
primary RS will be initiated (that far stability testing of secondary RS could stand for the primary RS as 
well). 
Container closure system  
The container closure system of faricimab finished product consists of a 2ml Type I glass vial closed 
with a fluororesin-laminated butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum seal with a plastic flip-off cap. The 
materials in contact with the finished product comply with Ph. Eur. requirements and appropriate for 
storage of the finished product. Specifications, drawing of elements and information on the dimensions 
of components are adequately provided.  
The finished product is co-packaged with a transfer filter needle (BD 18G 1 x 1/2’’stainless steel 
transfer filter needle 5 µm; filter material: acrylic copolymer) and a leaflet in a carton folding box. The 
filter is CE-marked.. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 30 months when stored at 2-8°C is claimed for the finished product. 
In general, stability studies were carried out in accordance with ICH Q5C. The protocol (including 
specification, methods, and test intervals) is provided and considered appropriate. Quality attributes 
(potency, purity, content) general attributes (pH, colour, clarity) and container closure integrity were 
addressed. The analytical methods used were demonstrated to be stability indicating.. 
Stability studies are being conducted under long-term (5°C), accelerated (25°C) and stress conditions 
(40°C). The stability batches are representative of the commercial finished product batches. The same 
containers were used in the stability studies as for marketing.   
Additional stability data was provided in the response document.  
Photostability study was performed in line with ICH Q1B. In summary, the results demonstrated that 
the faricimab finished product is photolabile, but the secondary packages provide adequate protection 
from light. The finished product should be kept in the original carton to protect from light, this issue is 
reflected in the SmPC. 
The in-use stability studies were described. The results demonstrated that faricimab finished product is 
physically and chemically stable under the tested conditions. From a microbiological point of view, the 
prepared injection solution should be used immediately, as described in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
The commitment to put at least one finished product batch per year on long-term storage stability, 
using the proposed post approval stability protocol is endorsed. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Cell banks were suitably tested to demonstrate freedom from adventitious agents. The use of 
appropriate analytical methodology revealed no identifiable virus-like particles other than A-type and 
C-type retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs), which are intrinsic to the CHO cell line. 
Preharvest cell culture fluid (PHCCF) is tested for adventitious viruses, mycoplasma and endotoxin. 
Additionally, endotoxin and bioburden is tested with action limits throughout the purification process. 
Tests methods are compendial, and are briefly described. Product specific verification has been 
performed, results are provided. 
None of the materials (including raw materials and reagents) used in the faricimab active substance 
and finished product manufacturing process are derived from TSE/ BSE relevant species. 
Small scale virus clearance studies (using model viruses) demonstrated that satisfactory log reduction 
values could be achieved by virus inactivation (low pH inactivation step) and removal (chromatography 
columns and small virus retention filter) in the faricimab purification process supporting the acceptable 
parameter ranges. Conditions of sanitisation and re-use of columns are reported and validated. The 
virus filter is a single-use filter and therefore a new filter was used for each validation experiment. 
An appropriate retrovirus risk evaluation was also conducted. It can be concluded that the purification 
process provides sufficient capacity for retrovirus reduction. 
Validity of small-scale models for the inactivation by low pH and removal by small-virus retentive 
filtration and chromatography steps is demonstrated. 
Additionally, the common quantification median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay validation 
demonstrate the suitability of the TCID50 to quantify the model viruses. 
Overall, Faricimab is safe for use with regards to lack of risk for transmission of adventitious agents.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Overall, the manufacturing process, process control, elucidation of structure and specifications for 
Faricimab active substance and finished product have been appropriately presented. Some additional 
information/clarification have been requested at day 120 regarding active substance heterogeneity, 
characterisation and validation results/criteria of certain analytical methods used for impurity testing; 
and further justification was required in some areas of the product control strategy including finished 
product release acceptance criteria. Additional stability data was provided to support the proposed 
active substance/finished product shelf life. Based on the extensive comparability studies it can be 
concluded, that the batches used in clinical trials are representative to the commercial product to 
guarantee that the latter will be the same as the clinical batches. All raised questions have been 
addressed and 3 recommendations are proposed related to submission upon completion of leachable 
studies and inclusion of defined additional tests of the RS.  
A satisfactory overview on a nitrosamine risk assessment is included in the dossier. 
The risk for transmission of adventitious agents seems adequately controlled and minimised by 
complementary measures implemented at various stages of the manufacturing process.  
From the quality perspective, Faricimab is considered approvable.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of Vabysmo is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. To provide full leachable data for the active substance container closure system upon study 
completion (up to maximum 60 months). The study is foreseen to be completed in Q2 2025. 
2. The long-term leachables study the finished product container closure system will be continued for 
at least up to 36 months covering the proposed finished product shelf life of 30 months, and any 
results that are above the toxicological thresholds or any new leachables not previously identified will 
be reported to EMA. Final results of the 36 months’ time point will be available after study completion 
in October 2023. 
3. To include defined additional tests when either a new primary reference standard or an updated 
protocol is submitted for post marketing approval. 
 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
Faricimab (RO6867461) is a humanized bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody generated by 
CrossMAb technology that selectively binds to and neutralizes both angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is composed of two different heavy chains (HC) and 
two different light chains (LC). One arm of the antibody binds VEGF and the other arm binds Ang 2. 
The VEGF binding domain is a humanized fragment antigen binding (Fab) and is comparable to other 
anti VEGF molecules, e.g., ranibizumab. The Ang 2 binding domain is a human Fab derived from phage 
display. The constant part is based on a human IgG1 framework. The variable part contains heavy 
chain VH3 and light chain Vκ1 subgroup sequences (for the anti VEGF arm) and heavy chain VH1 and 
light chain Vλ3 (for the anti-Ang-2 arm), respectively. To enforce heterodimerization of the two 
different heavy chains, several point mutations were introduced (“knobs into holes”). Exchange of CH1 
and CL domains in the Ang-2 binding Fab promotes the correct assembly of the two different light 
chains, known as the “CrossMAb approach”. 
The fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion was specifically engineered to reduce systemic exposure and 
reduce inflammatory potential. Mutations in the Fc domain of RO6867461 abolish binding to Fcγ 
receptors located on effector cells, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). 
Faricimab has a total molecular weight of approximately 146 kDa and is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology using mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture. 
Angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of intraocular neovascular syndromes (e.g. Age-related 
Macular Degeneration (AMD)). Targeting VEGF-A with monoclonal antibody is a state-of-art therapy in 
case of patients suffering from neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) or Diabetic 
Macular Edema (DME) (ranibizumab (LUCENTIS)). Ang-2 seems to be a complex regulator of vascular 
remodelling that plays a role in both vessel sprouting and vessel regression. Ang-2 causes vascular 
instability by promoting endothelial destabilization, pericyte loss, and pathological angiogenesis. The 
bispecific antibody targets both VEGF-A and Ang-2 mediated mechanisms. 
In vitro studies 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies used in vitro test systems to determine the specificity of faricimab 
to VEGF-A and Ang-2 and to exclude the possible binding to FCγRI, FCγRII, FCγRIIIa, C1q and to FcRn. 
These test systems on one hand were binding assays performed by Surface Plasmon Resonance and 
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry techniques. These experiments showed specific binding of faricimab to 
human VEGF-A and Ang-2 antigens, and no Ang-1 binding was observed. The KD value of faricimab 
binding to human VEGF-A121 And VEGF-A165 was 3 nM investigated by Isothermal Titration 
Calorimetry. Based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments faricimab appears to bind to 
ANG-2 and VEGF-A both independently and simultaneously i.e., faricimab can bind to both ligands at 
the same time.

Genetic modification was carried out on the molecule to inhibit the Fc arm binding. These modifications 
of faricimab neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding sites (located in the 
CH3 domains) disable the antibody’s Fc mediated effector functions: The “PG-LALA” mutation 
abrogates the binding to FcλRs and C1q. Additional point mutations (“TripleA”) located in the CH3 
domains of the Fc region of faricimab disable the functional binding to the FcRn. According to the 
binding measurements, these modifications were effective, and no binding was observed to FcγRI, 
FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa and FcR receptors. These experiments exclude the possible Fc fragment-mediated 
unwanted effects. 
The Applicant provided additional data in the amended report. These sensogram data clearly show the 
binding affinities for FCγ, FCγRIIA, FCγRIIIA and FcRn binding sites. In case of “no binding”, positive 
and negative binding controls were applied to ensure the suitability of the assay.  
Cell based in vitro assays 
For pivotal clinical studies, mode of action-reflective cell-based assays were selected and validated to 
be used as potency assays. Considering that both faricimab functionalities have independent biological 
 
effects related to clinical efficacy, two independent cell-based assays, each addressing one of the two 
faricimab functionalities, were used in conjunction with two independent potency specifications. 
Tie-2 Phosphorylation Assay: Tie-2 is the main receptor for Ang-2, downstream effects (e.g. 
proliferation) are mediated via Tie-2 receptor activation. The best characterized in vitro system to 
monitor Ang-2 function is to measure its agonistic function on Tie-2 phosphorylation in the absence of 
Ang-1. Tie-2 phosphorylation assay was shown to be sensitive to the neutralisation of the Ang-2 ligand 
by faricimab (HEK293 cell lines (VEGFR2, Tie-2). 
VEGF Reporter Gene Assay: Faricimab dose-dependent inhibition of the NFAT-Luciferase reporter gene 
expression is quantified by measuring luminescence after addition of a luminescent Luciferase 
substrate.  
Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) anti-proliferation assay: Faricimab dose-dependent 
inhibition of VEGF-induced HUVEC cells proliferation is quantified using a luminescence substrate after 
3 days incubation at 37ºC. 
The results of all of the three cell-based in vitro experimental setup show effectiveness of faricimab in 
vitro in a dose-dependent fashion.  
Simultaneous binding events were detected by measuring the sequence of binding by first adding Ang-
2 followed by VEGF-A and first adding VEGF-A followed by Ang-2.  
In vivo studies 
The PD and PK of faricimab was tested on the eyes of Cynomolgus monkeys in vivo, pre-treated by 
laser beam to induce damage, leakage and neovascularization in the retina as a model of wet Age-
related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). Ranibizumab, the VEGF-targeting mAb was investigated 
simultaneously with other mAbs as active controls. 
The intravitreal administration of faricimab showed effectiveness dose dependently and in the dose of 
30 µg proved to be equally effective to ranibizumab (Lucentis 30 µg). The higher (equimolar) dose of 
faricimab 90 µg reduced the damage severity (Fig.10) and the Grade-4 lesions (Fig.11) in the retina 
substantially better than ranibizumab in the dose of 30 µg ((0.91 vs 0.55, respectively, p=0.0039). (Of 
note faricimab has three times higher molecular weight - 146,157 Da than ranibizumab - 48,350 Da).

The CHMP noted that the Applicant presented the in vivo experimental model only for nAMD and not 
for DME, in contrast with the intended indications of faricimab. Hence, the Applicant was requested to 
justify the scientific (pathological, molecular) basis of intended use in other indications. In response, 
the Applicant explained that in diabetic macular edema (DME), Ang-2 is up-regulated due to chronic 
hyperglycemia, which increases vascular destabilization and sensitivity to VEGF similar to the situation 
in nAMD. An alternative rodent model for DME was not tested because the antibody in question reacts 
with human VEGF-A antigen and not with rodent, so classical animal models of diabetes could not work 
according to the applicant. However, it might have been possible to test the effect of faricimab in 
cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous diabetes (Sun et al. 2020), as this bispecific Ab works in this 
species, similarly to ranibizumab used across the studies in this application. This is however not a 
blocking issue.  
There was no apparent safety pharmacology signal in the submitted documentation of faricimab in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. 
In summary the effectiveness of faricimab was tested on the eyes of Cynomolgus monkeys in vivo, 
pre-treated by laser beam to induce damage, leakage and neovascularization in the retina as a model 
of wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). The intravitreal administration of faricimab showed 
effectiveness dose dependently and in the dose of 30 µg proved to be equal effective as ranibizumab 
(Lucentis) (30 µg). The higher dose of faricimab (90 µg) reduced the damage severity grade in the 
retina significantly higher than ranibizumab in the dose of 30 µg. 
The primary characteristics of faricimab as a VEGF-A and ANG-2 neutralizing antibody have been 
demonstrated in in vitro pharmacology studies. The in vitro and in vivo assays seem to support the 
binding affinity, specificity, and biological activity of the bispecific monoclonal antibody faricimab on 
the target structures VEGF-A and Ang-2 and the Applicant provided evidence on lack of unwanted 
bindings to other similar binding sites; with elimination of binding to FcRn to limit systemic plasma 
residence time. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have been conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics 
of faricimab (also termed RO6867461 and mAb<Ang2/VEGF>) in rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys 
following intravitreal (IVT) administration, the intended administration route in clinical studies. The PK 
parameters after a single-dose administration of faricimab were investigated via IVT and intravenous 
(IV) routes in rabbits and monkeys and after multiple-dose administration of faricimab as part of the 
toxicokinetic studies. The repeat dose pharmacokinetics of faricimab were evaluated following multiple 
IVT and IV doses in 2-week non-GLP tolerance studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, and in 2-
month and 6-month GLP toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
The pilot PK and toxicology studies in rabbits demonstrated that the rabbit is not an appropriate 
species for the safety evaluation of IVT administered faricimab. 
2.3.3.1.  Methods of analyses 
Serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor samples were analyzed for faricimab concentration with ELISA 
methods. Several methods were developed, but only methods used for the determination of faricimab 
in Cynomolgus monkey serum in the pivotal GLP toxicology studies were validated. An ELISA method 
was developed for the determination of faricimab in Cynomolgus monkey plasma, but it was used only 
to analyze monkey serum samples in a pharmacological study.  
 
The ELISA method used for the determination of faricimab in Cynomolgus monkey vitreous humor 
assays in a pivotal GLP toxicology study was qualified. 
ADAs were analyzed using a one-step bridging ELISA format. The method used for the determination 
of ADA against faricimab in Cynomolgus monkey serum in the pivotal GLP toxicology studies were 
validated. 
2.3.3.2.  Absorption 
The Fc region of faricimab has been engineered to abolish binding interactions with the FcRn, which, 
after entering into systemic circulation via either the choroidal vasculature and/or uveal blood flow 
following distribution in aqueous humor, leads to rapid systemic elimination. Following single IVT 
administration of 1.5 mg/eye faricimab in cynomolgus monkeys, absorption-rate limited elimination 
resulting in flip-flop pharmacokinetics (slow elimination from the eye to systemic circulation as rate 
limiting factor for elimination from the systemic circulation [as shown after IV injection with a 
clearance of 0.0107 mL/min/kg]) was observed with a strong correlation between exposure in vitreous 
humor, aqueous humor, and systemic circulation. 
Following single IV administration, faricimab exhibited fast systemic clearance, which was associated 
with a short elimination half-life (t1/2) when compared with wild-type IgG, consistent with the 
engineered reduction in affinity for FcRn. 
In the toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys, there was a dose-proportional increase in the mean 
values for maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC) following both IVT and IV administration of faricimab. A correlation between ADA 
development and reduced systemic exposure was observed in both 2- and 6-month GLP toxicology 
studies; this did not compromise the overall readout of the studies because there was still sufficient 
exposure in ADA-positive animals. 
2.3.3.3.  Distribution 
No specific distribution study was performed to characterize the distribution of faricimab. 
Following IVT administration in cynomolgus monkeys, faricimab was distributed into aqueous humor 
(about 30% of vitreous humor AUC0-∞) and systemic circulation (approximately 1.3% of vitreous 
humor AUC0-∞). Faricimab was not detected in the untreated eye at any of the measured time points. 
Following IV administration in cynomolgus monkeys, faricimab was mainly distributed in the serum, 
with a mean volume of distribution under steady-state conditions value of 0.025 L/kg. This distribution 
pattern is similar to that of endogenous IgG. 
2.3.3.4.  Metabolism 
As the metabolism/catabolism of antibodies generally involves degradation to smaller peptides and 
amino acids, classical biotransformation studies were not conducted. 
2.3.3.5.  Excretion 
No specific excretion study was performed to characterize the excretion of faricimab. 
As described in Section 3.2.2.4, the elimination of faricimab is expected to occur via cleavage to small 
peptides and amino acids, which may be excreted renally, in a similar manner to the elimination of 
endogenous IgG. 
2.3.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
No PK drug interaction studies (e.g., cytochrome P450 interaction) were performed with faricimab. 
There was no evidence of faricimab-mediated specific cytokine release within the range of 0.1-
100 μg/mL, thus no interaction via cytochrome P450 is expected. Additionally, faricimab is not 
expected to interact with other small molecule drugs because the clearance pathways of IgG molecules 
are distinct from those of small molecules. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program for faricimab has been designed to evaluate the non-clinical safety profile of 
faricimab and to support intravitreal (IVT) dosing in patients. 
Consistent with ICH S6 (R1) guidance the rabbit and cynomolgus monkey were chosen as the test 
species for the in vivo safety evaluation with faricimab on the basis of their superior suitability for 
intravitreal (IVT) administration, their ocular anatomy being most comparable to human, and their 
overall pharmacological relevance as responders compared with rodent species, which were shown to 
be not fully cross-reactive.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 2 weeks in rabbits and up to 6 months in cynomolgus monkeys 
have been conducted. In addition, a GLP embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus 
monkeys, a non-GLP and a GLP tissue cross-reactivity study, and in vitro whole blood cytokine release 
assays have been conducted.  
Based on an initial exploratory study in rabbits, the severity of the ADA-related immune-mediated 
adverse ocular and systemic effects precluded using rabbits as a second species in subsequent GLP 
toxicology studies. The GLP general toxicology and safety pharmacology investigations were conducted 
only in cynomolgus monkeys, in which the animal immunogenicity-related findings were less impacting 
feasibility. 
All in vivo repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted using the IVT route of administration, which 
is the administration route in humans. In addition, intravenous (IV) administration was used in 2-week 
pilot toxicity studies, 2-month pivotal toxicity study and reproductive toxicity studies to investigate any 
possible systemic toxic effects of faricimab. 
The test material used in pivotal GLP non-clinical safety studies and the test material used in clinical 
trials and planned to be used for commercialization were considered comparable on the basis of 
analytical and biological comparability. All excipients of the IVT clinical Phase III and market 
formulation were included in the faricimab formulation used in the regulatory toxicology studies 
(except methionine). The safe use of methionine as novel pharmaceutical excipient for intravitreal use 
in humans was justified by appropriate toxicology and literature data in the Quality module. 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was performed in all general toxicology studies as well as in the embryo-fetal 
development study in Cynomolgus monkeys. Although NOAEL doses were 1.5 and 0.5 mg/eye/dose for 
IVT administered faricimab in 2-month and 6-month pivotal toxicology studies in Cynomolgus 
monkeys, the approach to calculate systemic exposure margins with the highest doses used in the 
pivotal toxicological studies due to the lack of ocular immune-mediated effects in the clinical trials is 
reasonable. Accordingly, systemic exposure margins were 8-10-fold (IVT) and more than 80-fold (IV) 
the faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in patients with nAMD or DME. Serum 
exposure (Cmax) at the high dose of 3 mg/kg in the embryo-fetal development study was more than 
 
500-fold greater than faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in patients with 
nAMD or DME.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, faricimab is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In the pathomechanism of neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) and Diabetic Macular 
Edema (DME) at least two factors are relevant. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) was described as a unique 
factor serving essential role in vascular leakage and plays a role in both vessel sprouting and vessel 
regression and pathological angiogenesis. The other factor is a homodimeric glycoprotein Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which plays a pivotal role in mediating active intraocular 
neovascularization in patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy and retinal-vein occlusion. Targeting 
VEGF-A with monoclonal antibody (e.g. IVT ranibizumab) is a state-of-art therapy in patients with 
nAMD or DME.  
The present application is a new invention concerning the antibody construction technique combining 
two different Fab sequences together to target VEGF-A and Ang-2 in one molecule, thus this construct 
is the main virtue of this drug development. Modifications in the sequence of this bispecific antibody 
resulted in elimination of binding to FcRn (TripleA) and to FCγRI, FCγRII, FCγRIIIa, C1q (PG-LALA).  
Faricimab binding to human VEGF-A and to Ang-2 was determined with Surface Plasmon Resonance 
(SPR) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) in vitro, while no binding was observed to human 
Ang-1, FcRn, FCγRI, FCγRII, FCγRIIIa, C1q excluding the possibility of potential adverse events. Cell-
based in vitro experiments like Tie-2 Phosphorylation Assay, VEGF reporter gene assay and Human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) anti-proliferation assay were carried out with a limited number 
of data presented and found in the Quality module. 
The in vitro binding was supported by additional figures for the SPR and ITC assays. The Applicant has 
demonstrated that double binding occurs regardless of which antigen the antibody binds first as it was 
demonstrated in the publication of Regula, 2016, 2017, 2019.  
The effectiveness of faricimab was tested on the eyes of Cynomolgus monkeys in vivo, pre-treated by 
laser beam to induce damage, leakage and neovascularization in the retina as a model of nAMD. The 
intravitreal administration of faricimab showed effectiveness dose dependently and in the dose of 30 
µg proved to be equal effective to ranibizumab 30 µg. The higher dose of faricimab (90 µg) reduced 
the damage severity grade in the retina substantially better than ranibizumab in the (equimolar) dose 
of 30 µg. Concentration of faricimab was determined in the aqueous humour, in the tear and in the 
plasma. Data provided in tables about the individual cases show decline in concentration versus time in 
all of the examined sample source.  
In pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys, IV injections of faricimab resulting in serum exposure (Cmax) more 
than 500-times of the maximum human exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity 
and had no effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its pharmacological action 
faricimab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/fetotoxic biological.  
 
Drug-drug interactions are not expected as faricimab is given alone intravitreally and the resulting 
plasma concentrations have been considered to be very low. 
There was no apparent safety pharmacology signal in in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Toxicology 
In the 2-week non-GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys, no ocular or systemic effects related to 
faricimab were observed following two applications of 1.5, 3, or 6 mg/right eye/dose (the maximum 
feasible dose) IVT or 3 and 10 mg/kg IV administered 14 days apart. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was established at the highest doses of 6 mg/right eye/dose for IVT and 10 mg/kg for 
IV. One half of the treated animals were confirmed positive for ADA formation against faricimab, 
however, there was no reduction in systemic exposure of RO6867461. 
In 2- and 6-month GLP studies, cynomolgus monkeys received up to 3 monthly doses of 1.5, 3, or 6 
mg/right eye/dose IVT and up to 7 monthly doses at 0.5, 1.5, or 1.5/3 mg/right eye/dose IVT, 
respectively, with the high-dose group in the 6-month study receiving 1.5 mg/right eye/dose for the 
first IVT dose only followed by 3 mg/right eye/dose for subsequent doses. In the 2- and 6-month GLP 
study, the NOAEL was 1.5 mg/right eye/dose and 0.5 mg/right eye/dose, respectively. The effects of 
monthly IV doses of faricimab at 5 mg/kg were evaluated in the 2-month GLP study. The majority of 
animals in both studies were confirmed positive for ADA formation against faricimab. 
In the 2- and 6-month GLP studies, animal immune-mediated ocular inflammatory cell infiltration and 
clinical signs of ocular inflammation occurred in faricimab-treated eyes following IVT administration 
every 4 weeks at doses of 3 and 6 mg/right eye/dose or 1.5 and 1.5/3 mg/right eye/dose, 
respectively. Ocular findings generally correlated with the systemic presence of ADAs against faricimab 
and exposure loss in the serum of animals. In addition, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence 
of immune-complex deposits in affected eyes of faricimab-treated animals. No clinical ocular findings 
were observed in recovery animals after a 4- or 13-week treatment-free recovery period in the 2- and 
6-month study, respectively. Inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltration was the only histopathological 
finding at the end of recovery in the 6-month study at 1.5 and 1.5/3 mg/right eye/dose. There were no 
relevant findings in the vehicle-treated eyes up to 6 months of treatment. 
Faricimab did not induce any systemic effects in general toxicology studies up to 6 mg/eye IVT and up 
to 10 mg/kg IV, except for animal immune-mediated minimal mixed-cell inflammation in the aortic 
root of the heart observed in 2 animals at the end of the 4-week recovery period in the 2-month GLP 
study. Systemic presence of ADAs against faricimab was confirmed in 1 animal, and 
immunohistochemistry confirmed immune-complex formation and deposition in both animals at the 
aortic root. No extra-ocular findings were observed in the 6-month study in monkeys. 
Although the systemic exposure margins of the highest tested doses in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
appear sufficiently high compared to expected human dose (around 10-fold for 1.5 / 3 mg/eye/dose), 
the exposure margin at the NOAEL of 0.5 mg/eye/dose (based on the animal immune mediated ocular 
effects in the 6 month monkey study) with mean AUC(0-72h) = 20200 ng•hr/mL and a mean Cmax = 
220 ng/mL on Day 141, is only around 1 when compared to values of human exposure listed and used 
for calculation by the applicant. This should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. The ocular 
immune-mediated effects observed in animal studies were not recorded in the completed clinical 
development program with faricimab. 
Moreover, some (slight) deviations between control and high dose group were observed in the ECG 
after IVT administration to the right eye in the male recovery group, e.g. decrease in QT and QTc 
interval and increase of QRS duration at Day 87 of recovery in the male treatment group. The 
Applicant stated that ‘Electrocardiograms (ECGs) using jacketed external telemetry (JET) procedures 
were collected during the pre-dose phase, on dedicated days of the dosing phase, and during the 
recovery phase in conscious animals. In both studies, heart rate and ECG endpoints, including QT and 
QTc, were comparable between control and faricimab-dosed groups.’ The Applicant was able to provide 
a plausible explanation for the deviations in the recovery phase by to the small number of animals, 
compared to all other days in the “inlife phase”, biasing the mean ECG data in the recovery phase to 
these few animals. 
No dedicated local tolerance studies were conducted. Tolerability for application of faricimab following 
the IVT and IV route was established in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys. 
Consistent with ICH S6 (R1) guidance no genotoxicity studies have been conducted; faricimab is a 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical that is not expected to directly interact with DNA or other 
chromosomal material. 
Faricimab is a biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical, and the need for animal studies for carcinogenic 
potential of faricimab has been assessed, consistent with ICH S6 (R1) guidance. No standard rodent 
carcinogenicity studies have been conducted as faricimab is not fully cross-reactive in rodents. The 
intended anti-angiogenic effects of faricimab and the weight of evidence do not suggest a carcinogenic 
potential of faricimab. 
No effects of faricimab on male or female fertility were observed following 7 monthly IVT doses of 
1.5/3 mg in the chronic 6-month study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. 
An embryofetal development study in cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal any effects of faricimab on 
the course and outcome of pregnancy or fetal viability following 5 weekly IV injections starting on 
gestation day 20 (GD20) at up to 3 mg/kg. A pre- and postnatal development study could not be 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys due to ADA formation and exposure loss observed in general 
toxicology studies preventing sufficient systemic exposure with faricimab in such a study. 
No adverse findings in RDT and EFD studies after IV Faricimab administration (at sufficiently high 
exposure) were somehow surprising with regard to the known class effect of VEGF inhibitors, however 
the Applicant covered this already known class effect accordingly in the SmPC under 5.3. ‘In pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys, IV injections of Vabysmo resulting in serum exposure (Cmax) more than 500-
times the maximum human exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity, and had no 
effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its pharmacological effect Vabysmo 
should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic.‘ Thus, no further action/studies 
are required as (expected) adverse findings in such studies would result in the same outcome, i.e. 
appropriate depiction in the SmPC. 
No unexpected tissue binding of faricimab was observed in cross-reactivity studies of normal human 
tissues. The results of in vitro cytokine release assays in human cells indicated no substantial risk of 
cytokine release syndrome, direct complement activation, or peripheral immune-cell depletion with 
administration of faricimab. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The in vitro binding- and cell-based assays seem to support the binding affinity, specificity, and 
biological activity of the bispecific monoclonal antibody faricimab on both of the target structures 
VEGF-A and Ang-2 and Applicant provided evidence on lack of unwanted bindings to other binding 
sites.  
 
The effectiveness of faricimab was demonstrated in vivo on laser beam induced damage model for 
nAMD in Cynomolgus monkeys. IVT administered faricimab substantially and dose dependently 
diminished the severity of retinal damage, and this efficacy seems to be superior to the comparator 
ranibizumab, one of the widely used VEGF inhibitors. 
No specific safety signals have emerged during the studies. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Intravitreal administration is the established clinical route for faricimab. Faricimab administered IVT 
distributes mainly in the eye, but it also reaches the systemic circulation. The elimination is slow from 
the eyes. Due to absorption-rate limited elimination, the elimination is also slow from the serum.  
After IV administration, faricimab exhibits fast systemic clearance.  
In the toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, there was a dose-proportional increase in the mean 
values for maximum observed serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve 
following both IVT and IV administrations of faricimab. 
Toxicology 
In summary, no target-related toxicological changes were observed up to the highest doses tested with 
faricimab including the evaluation of repeat-dose toxicity, male and female fertility, and embryofetal 
development using cynomolgus monkeys, the only feasible species cross-reactive to faricimab. Ocular 
and systemic changes observed in general toxicology studies mainly at higher doses were related to an 
animal immune-mediated response to faricimab. 
There seems to be no safety margin at IVT administration as ocular inflammation was observed in 
some monkeys in case of the medium, 1.5 mg/eye dose used in 6-month repeat dose study. The high 
IVT dose of 3 mg/eye used in the 6-month repeat dose monkey study provides exposure coverage for 
the 6 mg clinical dose of faricimab based on the difference in vitreous volume. Inflammatory ocular 
reactions observed at higher doses in the 6-month study were animal immune-mediated responses to 
the administration of a humanized protein like faricimab. .     
The ocular inflammations were mild to moderate and were reversible after recovery phase, therefore 
this toxic effect is not expected to impact the final Benefit/Risk conclusion, taking into consideration 
the serious target indication, treatment of progressive eye sight loss secondary to nAMD and DME. 
Animal immune-mediated responses were also observed in studies with ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF 
Fab, and lampalizumab, an anti-factor D antibody. Ocular immune-mediated effects observed in animal 
studies were not recorded in the completed clinical development program with faricimab.  
Faricimab can be considered a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, faricimab is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
The systemic exposure margins were 8-10-fold (IVT) and more than 80-fold (IV) the faricimab human 
steady-state systemic exposure estimates in patients with nAMD or DME. Serum exposure at the high 
dose of 3 mg/kg in the embryo-fetal development study was more than 500-fold greater than 
faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in patients with nAMD or DME. 
In conclusion, also in light of the responses to the questions formulated during the assessment, the 
toxicological evaluation can support the application for approval of faricimab as a new therapeutic 
option for treatment of the proposed indications at the intended dose via IVT administration. 
 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The present application seeks approval for faricimab, a bispecific IgG1 antibody, for the treatment of 
adult patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema 
(DME). The recommended dose of faricimab is 6 mg administered by intravitreal injection Q4W for the 
first 4 doses, followed by 6 mg at intervals of up to Q16W for both nAMD and DME. 
The clinical pharmacokinetics of faricimab has been characterized in nine clinical studies in patients 
with nAMD and DME; 2 Phase I, 3 Phase II and 4 Phase III studies. A population PK analysis was also 
conducted. No dedicated clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. 
Bioanalytical methods 
 
 
 
Concentrations of faricimab (active drug), Ang-2, VEGF-A (biomarkers), ranibizumab, and aflibercept 
(active comparators) were measured in human aqueous humor and plasma, and anti-drug antibodies 
(ADAs) against faricimab in plasma samples. All available Phase III samples and faricimab and ADA  
samples obtained from Phase I and Phase II studies were analyzed using fully validated assay 
methods. The ADA assay strategy used a three-tiered approach. 
Generally, both the pre-study and in-study validations were appropriate and well documented. The 
concentration ranges were appropriate for the clinical trials. The methods were demonstrated to be 
precise and accurate for the analysis of human samples. The assays were carried out within the 
validated long-term stability period (except of biomarker assays). 
Population PK analysis of faricimab 
The population PK analysis was performed using data from Phase I (BP28936, JP39844), Phase II 
(BP29647, CR39521, BP30099), and Phase III (GR40306, GR40844, GR40349, GR40398) studies, 
which included PK measurements of faricimab in plasma and aqueous humour (AH). 
A total of 1095 AH observations from 284 patients and 8372 plasma observations from 2246 patients 
were available for the analysis. There were 1366 (60.8%) patients that had DME and 880 (39.2%) who 
had nAMD. Patients with nAMD (mean age 76.0 years, range 50-99 years; mean weight 75.2 kg, range 
37.3-172 kg) were on average older and lighter than patients with DME (mean age 62.1 years, range 
24-91 years; mean weight 86.8 kg, range 40.5-209 kg). ADAs were detected at least once after the 
start of faricimab administration in 218 (9.7%) patients. 
This was a 3-compartment linear model, composed of the VH compartment, where the drug is injected, 
the AH compartment, and the plasma compartment with clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) (Figure 12). 
Bioavailability (F) was assumed to be 1. The volume of VH compartment (VVH) was fixed to the 
literature value of 0.0045 L (Hutton-Smith et al, 2016). The parameters of the final popPK model 051 
are presented in Table 8.

Phase I studies  
Study BP28936 
This was a SAD and MAD study in patients with nAMD (≥50years). 
The study was divided in two parts: 
• 
Part A where SADs were administered. 3 patients were enrolled at each dose level and the 
doses evaluated sequentially were 0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg (N=12). 
 
• 
Part B, MAD where three doses were administered at Q4W intervals to 6 patients/dose. Part B 
was initiated only once the maximum tolerated dose was identified in Part A. 
Plasma and optional AH samples were collected for measurement of faricimab and ADA. 
Ocular and plasma pharmacokinetics 
The individual concentration time profiles for the patients that had evaluable AH and plasma data are 
presented in Figure 15. For each patient, the AH concentration time profile declined in parallel to the 
profile in plasma and is consistent with flip flop kinetics, where the slowest rate, i.e., elimination from 
the vitreous, governs the overall elimination of faricimab from the body. The individual t1/2 in AH 
ranged from 6 to 13 days. 
Figure 15. AH concentration time profiles 
Plasma PK parameters derived using NCA are reported in Table 9. Based on Cmax, plasma faricimab 
concentrations were >100-fold lower than those in AH. The estimated apparent plasma t1/2 ranged 
from 5-15 days across SAD and MAD. The Tmax was either Day 3 or Day 7 in the SAD part, 
independent of dose.

Study JP39844 
This was a multiple dose study in Japanese patients (50-85 years) with nAMD or DME. 
In Step 1, patients (N=6) received 1.5 mg intravitreal faricimab Q4W (for a total of up to three doses). 
Step 2 was initiated upon demonstration of safety in Step 1 and different patients (N=6) received 6 mg 
intravitreal faricimab every Q4W (for a total of up to three doses). Plasma samples were collected for 
measurement of faricimab and ADA. AH faricimab concentrations were not analysed because no 
patients consented to collection. 
Plasma pharmacokinetics 
Plasma PK parameters are summarized in Table 10. The mean plasma faricimab concentration peaked 
2 days after administration with a monophasic elimination with a mean steady-state t1/2 of 
approximately 10 days at both dose levels. Consistent with the observed t1/2, the accumulation index 
was approximately 1, which is similar to the ratio in non-Asian patients observed in Study BP28936.

Phase II studies  
Study CR39521 (STAIRWAY) 
This was a multiple dose 52-week study in patients with nAMD (≥50 years). 
Eligible patients were randomized to one of three treatment arms: 
• 
• 
Faricimab Q12W: 6 mg faricimab Q4W by intravitreal injection up to Week 12 (4 injections), 
followed by 6 mg faricimab Q12W up to Week 48 (3 injections) (N=29). 
Faricimab Q16W: 6 mg faricimab Q4W by intravitreal injection up to Week 12 (4 injections), 
followed by 6 mg faricimab Q16W up to Week 48 (2 injections). A protocol-defined assessment 
of disease activity at Week 24 required patients with active disease to then receive a Q12W 
dosing interval for the remainder of the study (N=31). 
•  Ranibizumab Q4W (comparator arm): 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W by intravitreal injection for 48 
weeks (13 injections) (N=16). 
Ocular and plasma pharmacokinetics 
Faricimab PK in AH are summarised in Table 11. AH samples (optional) were collected from only 14 
faricimab-treated patients. Therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. 
 
 
 
Table 11. STAIRWAY – Summary of concentration in aqueous humor. 
Faricimab PK in plasma are summarised in Table 12. At Week 16 (i.e., 4 weeks following administration 
of the fourth Q4W faricimab dose), concentrations in plasma were similar in both groups. After Week 
16, patients received faricimab either Q12W or Q16W. For the faricimab Q12W group, 4 weeks after 
administration of a previous dose, plasma concentrations were >580-fold lower than those in the AH. 
 
 
 
Table 12. Study STAIRWAY: PK in plasma. 
Study BP29647 (AVENUE)  
This was a multiple dose 36-week study in patients with nAMD (≥50 years). 
A total of 273 patients were randomized into five treatment arms and were administered study 
treatment by intravitreal injection from Day 1 to Week 32 according to the following schedule: 
•  Ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4W (N=68) 
• 
• 
• 
Faricimab 1.5 mg Q4W (N=46) 
Faricimab 6 mg Q4W (N=39) 
Faricimab 6 mg Q8W (N=46): 6 mg Q4W up to Week 12 followed by 6 mg Q8W 
•  Ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4W followed by faricimab 6 mg Q4W (N=64): 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W 
up to Week 8 followed by 6 mg faricimab Q4W 
Ocular and plasma PK 
AH samples (optional) were collected in 10 patients randomized to faricimab 1.5 mg Q4W, 9 patients 
randomized to faricimab 6 mg Q4W, and 9 patients randomized to faricimab 6 mg Q8W. Mean 
faricimab concentration-time profiles in AH are presented in Figure 16. 
 
 
 
Figure 16. Mean concentration-time profiles in AH 
Mean faricimab concentration-time profiles in plasma are presented in Figure 17. For 6 mg Q8W, the 
Week 36 sampling time point represents the only 8 weeks post-dose assessment. Exposures at 8 
weeks post-dose were about 10% that of exposures at 4 weeks post-dose (6 mg Q4W versus Q8W at 
Week 36). Based on the Week 12 concentrations, plasma concentrations were >400 times lower than 
those in AH.

Study BP30099 (BOULEVARD) 
This was a multi-dose study in patients with DME (≥18 years). 
A total of 229 patients were randomized to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  Ranibizumab 0.3 mg Q4W, N=90  
• 
• 
Faricimab 1.5 mg Q4W, N=55  
Faricimab 6 mg Q4W, N=84  
Study treatment was administered on Day 1 followed by Q4W for a total of 6 intravitreal injections. 
Ocular and plasma pharmacokinetics 
Samples of AH were collected for 46 faricimab-treated patients (N=16 for 1.5 mg arm and N=30 for 6 
mg arm).  
Mean faricimab concentration-time profiles in AH are presented in Figure 18. Faricimab concentrations 
in AH remained stable with Q4W dosing. Following administration of the last dose (Week 20), faricimab 
concentrations in AH declined in parallel at both dose levels. 
 
Figure 18 Study BOULEVARD – mean log-scale faricimab concentration-time profiles in aqueous 
humor 
The mean faricimab plasma concentration-time profiles are presented in Figure 19. Plasma 
concentrations remained stable with subsequent Q4W doses at both dose levels. Plasma concentrations 
at later times postdose were lower as expected due to the exponential decrease after cessation of 
treatment. On Day 7, plasma concentrations were >580 times lower than those in AH.

•  Bioequivalence 
Three formulations were used in the clinical trials (F03, F04 and F06). F03 and F04 were used in the 
Phase I/II studies and only differed in concentration of the active ingredient. F06, the to-be-marketed 
formulation, was used in the Phase III studies.  
A formal bioequivalence study between formulations was not conducted. Based on the final population 
PK model, the plasma exposure (steady-state AUC) was predicted to be 22.6% higher in Phase I-II 
studies compared to Phase III studies for a similar dose. This was caused by plasma clearance being 
18.4% lower in Phase I-II studies. However, there were no differences in VH exposure between Phase 
I-II and Phase III studies and the safety profile of faricimab was consistent between studies. Since the 
formulation changed between Phase I-II and Phase III, it was not possible to differentiate the study 
effect from a formulation effect. Overall, the difference in plasma exposure observed between Phase II 
and Phase III studies is considered not clinically meaningful. 
Distribution 
In the population PK analysis, plasma Vc/F was 1.48 L, which is consistent with a limited distribution. 
Elimination 
 
 
Faricimab was engineered to abolish binding to the FcRn receptor, which is responsible for the 
recycling of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the normally long terminal t1/2 of IgG of ~21 days. Without 
recycling, faricimab metabolism is through IgG proteolysis, which results in rapid elimination from the 
plasma. A summary of individual PK parameter estimates from the final population PK model (rate 
constants and corresponding half-lives for VH, AH and plasma) for Phase III study patients are 
summarised in Table 13.  
Table 13. Individual estimates of faricimab PK parameters. 
Since the estimated kVH is much lower than kAH (kAH/kVH = 168) and k (k/kVH = 16.9), the kinetics 
of faricimab are dominated by slow release from the VH. The estimated VH elimination half-life is 7.5 
days, whilst the estimated plasma elimination half-life is 0.44 days. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Faricimab doses tested in the clinical studies ranged from 0.5 mg to 6 mg.  
In the Phase I study BP28936, based on single dose maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under 
the concentration-time curve (AUC), there was an approximate dose-proportional increase in faricimab 
plasma exposure up to 3 mg. There was no apparent increase in systemic exposure for the 6 mg dose 
group as compared to the 3 mg dose group. However, the apparent lack of systemic exposure increase 
from 3 mg to 6 mg should be interpreted with caution due the sparse sampling schedule. There was no 
apparent faricimab accumulation in plasma following multiple faricimab administration, as assessed 
with AUCtau and Cmax. 
In the Phase II AVENUE study (nAMD), observed mean faricimab plasma concentrations at trough and 
at Week 13 (1 week after the last administration) were about 4-fold higher at 6 mg Q4W as compared 
to 1.5 mg Q4W. No plasma accumulation was observed following Q4W administration. 
In the Phase II BOULEVARD study (DME), mean plasma Ctrough faricimab concentrations were 
approximately 2-4 times higher following administration of 6 mg compared with 1.5 mg. No plasma 
accumulation was observed following Q4W administration. 
The popPK model described the single and multiple dose AH and plasma data. All transfer and 
elimination processes were first-order linear processes. No faricimab accumulation in the ocular or 
 
plasma compartments was observed, with steady state reached by the end of the 12-week Q4W 
initiation dose period. 
Inter-individual variability 
In the Phase III TENAYA and LUCERNE studies (nAMD patients), high inter-patient variability was 
observed in faricimab AH concentrations (CV 40-394% and 51-245%, respectively) and plasma 
concentrations (CV 44-144% and 48-154%, respectively). Similarly, in the Phase III YOSEMITE and 
RHINE studies (DME patients), high inter-patient variability was observed in faricimab AH 
concentrations (CV 59-100% and 69-105%, respectively) and plasma concentrations (CV 45-199% for 
YOSEMITE; CV 52-184% for RHINE). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study GR40306 (TENAYA) and Study GR40844 (LUCERNE) 
Studies TENAYA and LUCERNE are ongoing, 112-week, identically designed pivotal Phase III studies in 
patients with nAMD. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: 
• 
Faricimab: Patients received 6 mg of intravitreal faricimab Q4W up to Week 12 (4 injections). 
At Week 20, patients with active disease received faricimab at that visit and continued on a 
fixed-Q8W dosing regimen. At Week 24, following a second assessment of disease activity, 
patients with active disease (excluding those with active disease at Week 20) received 
faricimab at that visit, and continued on a fixed-Q12W dosing regimen. Patients who did not 
have active disease at Week 20 and Week 24 were treated with a fixed-Q16W dosing regimen. 
These fixed dosing regimens continued until Week 60. 
From Week 60 onward, all patients are treated according to a personalized treatment interval (PTI) 
dosing regimen up to Week 108. 
•  Aflibercept: 2 mg of intravitreal aflibercept Q4W up to Week 8 (3 injections), followed by 2 mg 
of intravitreal aflibercept Q8W up to Week 108. 
The primary analyses were performed when all patients had either completed the study through Week 
48 or had discontinued from the study prior to Week 48.  
TENAYA ocular and plasma pharmacokinetics 
Faricimab concentrations in AH from 47 patients who consented to optional AH sampling were included 
in the PK data analysis. Mean faricimab AH concentration-time profiles are displayed in Figure 20. The 
maximum observed concentration [mean (SD) 92.5 (37.0) µg/mL] was 1 week post-dose (first 
timepoint following the first faricimab administration). At 12 and 16 weeks post-dose, approximately 
13% and 26% of the samples were BLQ.

concentration-time profiles are shown in Figure 21. The maximum observed concentration [mean (SD) 
0.207 (0.091) µg/mL] was 1 week post-dose (first timepoint following the first faricimab 
administration). Faricimab was measurable up to 8 weeks post-dose, where approximately 30% of the 
samples were BLQ. The ratio of faricimab AH to plasma on Day 7 was approximately 450.

Study GR40349 (YOSEMITE) and Study GR40398 (RHINE) 
Studies YOSEMITE and RHINE are 100-week, identically designed pivotal Phase III studies in patients 
with DME. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: 
•

AH faricimab concentrations from 80 patients who consented to optional AH sampling were included in 
the PK analysis. The mean AH concentration-time profiles are shown in Figure 24. The maximum 
observed mean (SD) concentrations at Week 1 (1 week after the first administration) were 74 (43.3) 
and 121.6 (71.4) for the Q8W and PTI regimen, respectively. At 12 weeks post-dose, approximately 
30% of the samples were BLQ.

Faricimab exposure predictions based on the population PK model  
Individual PK parameters estimated from the final population PK model were used to simulate 
individual faricimab concentration-time courses in plasma, AH, and VH for nAMD patients from Phase 
III studies GR40306 and GR40844 and DME patients from Phase III studies GR40349 and GR40398. 
The individual estimates of the steady-state exposure parameters following 6 mg Q8W doses (the 
highest proposed maintenance dose regimen) are summarised by disease type in Table 14. For a 
reference male patient with DME or nAMD (80 kg body weight, 65 years old, treated with the Phase III 
formulation and without ADAs), maximum free faricimab concentrations in plasma are predicted to be 
approximately 600 and 6000-fold lower than in aqueous and vitreous humour, respectively. 
 
 
 
Table 14. Steady state exposure estimates. 
The relationship between vitreous elimination rate constant and the frequency of drug administration 
was evaluated using the Phase III data. Figure 28 shows distribution of vitreous rate constant by 
dosing frequencies in the nAMD population treated with faricimab. Figure 29 shows distribution 
vitreous rate constant for each dosing frequency in the DME population treated with faricimab in the 
PTI arm. 
Despite the overlap between the different dosing regimens, the figures indicate an overall trend for 
patients who were treated less frequently to have lower vitreous elimination rate constants and, 
therefore, longer vitreous half-lives.

Immunogenicity 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was low (ranging from 0-11%), based on Phase I 
and II, and remained low (8-10%), based on Phase III study results (Table 15). 
 
 
In the Phase I and Phase II studies of faricimab in patients with nAMD and DME ≤11% of post-dose 
evaluable patients demonstrated treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA responses. In the 
pooled Phase III studies, 68/663 (10.4%) patients with nAMD and 105/1255 (8.4%) patients with DME 
showed treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA responses, which were persistent in 75-85% of 
the patients. The median time to onset of ADA response was 20 to 28 weeks. Titers ranged from 10-
20480 in nAMD and 10-81920 in DME. 
PopPK covariate analyses showed that plasma ADA had an effect on vitreous elimination t1/2. Patients 
with detected ADAs had 30.4% higher ocular elimination rate. As a consequence, ADA positive patients 
had 23.4% lower ocular exposure at steady state compared with ADA negative patients. Presence of 
plasma ADA had no effect on the plasma exposure. 
The impact on ocular exposure was considered minor, and exposure-response analysis showed a 
similar response across the range of vitreous exposure in Phase III, confirming that the changes in 
vitreous exposure in ADA-positive patients are unlikely to be associated with a change in efficacy. 
Based on all available data to date, no meaningful impact of ADA was observed on efficacy and on 
overall safety. Although a higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive compared with ADA-
negative patients, this observation is not considered to be clinically relevant (see Safety section for 
further details). 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
 
No specific studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment were conducted with faricimab. Both 
renal impairment and hepatic impairment were not identified as covariates influencing faricimab PK in 
the population PK analysis. No dose adjustment is necessary. 
•  Gender 
Systemic faricimab clearance was 13.7% slower in females, while VH elimination rate (and thus, VH 
exposure) was independent of sex. This change is not expected to be clinically significant due to the 
small magnitude of the effect and the low incidence of systemic, non-ocular, AEs. No dose adjustment 
is needed. 
•  Race 
In the popPK analysis, race was not identified as a clinically relevant covariate affecting either ocular or 
plasma faricimab disposition. Plasma PK data in Japanese patients from Study JP39844 were consistent 
with those in Study BP28936, which enrolled Caucasian patients. No dose adjustment is necessary. 
•  Weight 
Plasma volume and clearance increased with body weight. As patients with DME were on average 
heavier (mean weight 86.8 kg versus 75.2 kg for patients with nAMD), this translates to approximately 
10% lower systemic exposure (steady state AUC) in a typical patient with DME compared to a typical 
patient with nAMD. 
Faricimab was well tolerated across the broad plasma exposure range with low incidence of systemic, 
non-ocular AEs; therefore, differences in plasma exposure by bodyweight are considered not clinically 
meaningful and no body-weight based dosing is needed. 
•  Elderly 
In the four Phase III clinical studies, approximately 60% (1149/1929), 25% (486/1929) and 5% 
(95/1929) of patients randomised to faricimab were ≥65, ≥75 and ≥85 years of age, respectively. 
Age was an important covariate that influenced faricimab vitreous disposition (the site of action). The 
population PK model indicated that kVH declined with age and, therefore, VH t1/2 increased with age. 
A typical 44 year old patient had a VH elimination half-life approximately 31% shorter than a typical 89 
year old patient. This effect might be explained by changes in VH with age. As patients with DME were 
on average younger (mean age 62.1 years versus 76 years for patients with nAMD), this translates to 
approximately 10% shorter VH elimination half-life in a typical patient with DME compared to a typical 
patient with nAMD.  
The resulting age-based difference in ocular exposure is not considered to be clinically meaningful in 
view of the flat exposure BCVA correlation. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in patients aged 
65 years or above. 
Interactions 
Since faricimab is a monoclonal antibody, no drug-drug interactions are expected via cytochrome 
P450, other metabolizing enzymes, or transporters. Therefore, no formal drug-drug interaction studies 
were conducted for faricimab. In the population PK analysis, IOP lowering drugs did not have any 
effect on faricimab ocular PK. 
 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacodynamics of faricimab has been characterized in 8 clinical studies in patients with 
nAMD and DME; 1 Phase I, 3 Phase II and 4 Phase III studies. The PD markers of faricimab assessed 
in the clinical studies were angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). 
In addition, the relationships between efficacy endpoints (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and 
central subfield thickness [CST]) and vitreous faricimab PK were assessed in exposure-efficacy 
analyses. Exposure-safety analyses evaluated the relationship between intraocular inflammation (IOI) 
and vitreous faricimab PK. 
Mechanism of action 
Faricimab is a humanized bispecific IgG1 antibody that acts through inhibition of two distinct pathways 
by neutralization of both Ang-2 and VEGF-A. Ang-2 and VEGF are two key mediators in the 
pathogenesis of nAMD and DME. Ang-2 causes vascular instability by promoting endothelial 
destabilization, pericyte loss, and pathological angiogenesis, thus potentiating vascular leakage and 
inflammation. It also sensitizes blood vessels to the activity of VEGF-A resulting in further vascular 
destabilization. Ang-2 and VEGF-A synergistically increase vascular permeability and stimulate 
neovascularization. 
Primary pharmacology 
Phase I studies 
Study BP28936 
AH PD data were only available for 3 patients in the SAD part and 2 patients in the MAD part. 
Faricimab administration resulted in target engagement i.e., decrease in AH Ang-2 and VEGF.  
Phase II studies 
Study CR39521 (STAIRWAY) 
AH samples (optional) were only available for 11 patients in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W arm and 3 
patients in the Q16W arm. Therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. 
Data were not presented for Ang-2 since the majority of free Ang-2 levels in AH were BLQ.  
Mean free VEGF-A levels in AH were <10% of the baseline levels at 4 weeks post-first dose. In the 
Q12W group, AH VEGF-A levels remained lower than baseline at 8 and 12 weeks post-dose (Weeks 32 
and 36, respectively). The Q16W dose group suggested a trend for some VEGF-A suppression at 12 
weeks post-dose (Week 24), while the VEGF-A concentrations were similar to baseline values at 16 
weeks post-dose (Week 28). 
Study BP29647 (AVENUE)  
A large free Ang-2 suppression was observed for all faricimab treatment groups, assessed by either the 
proportion of BLQ or by mean values. Ang-2 was suppressed for at least 4 weeks, with 8 weeks being 
inconclusive due to lack of data. 
Trough free VEGF levels were at <10% (median) of the baseline levels for both doses (1.5 mg and 6 
mg faricimab) and both regimens (Q4W and Q8W; 4 and 8 weeks post-dose). 
There was no apparent change from baseline in mean Ang-2 or VEGF-A plasma concentrations across 
treatment arms. 
Study BP30099 (BOULEVARD) 
A large free Ang-2 suppression was observed for all faricimab treatment groups assessed by either the 
proportion of BLQ or by mean values. After cessation of treatment, free Ang-2 levels increased in the 
faricimab treatment groups, starting at 6 to 8 weeks postdose at 6 mg, but did not reach baseline 
levels at the end of the observation period (12 weeks postdose). 
Treatment with either 1.5 mg or 6 mg faricimab resulted in an almost complete free AH VEGF 
suppression at 1-week post dose and remained at ≤10% (median) of the baseline levels at trough. 
After cessation of treatment, free VEGF levels were close to the baseline levels at 6-8 weeks postdose 
for 1.5 mg faricimab, whereas for the 6 mg, VEGF levels were close to the baseline levels only at 12 
weeks postdose. 
No apparent changes in the Ang-2 and VEGF-A plasma profiles were observed at the 1.5 or 6 mg dose 
levels. 
Phase III studies in nAMD patients 
Study GR40306 (TENAYA) 
High inter-patient variability was observed in AH Ang-2 (CV 36%-134%) and VEGF-A (CV 47%-270%) 
concentrations.  
Rapid suppression of Ang-2 starting 7 days post-dose was observed and maintained at least up to 
Week 20, after which patients were assigned to a regimen based on disease activity. The percentage of 
Ang-2 levels measured BLQ decreased as the time from most recent dose increased. However, at 16 
weeks post-dose, a higher proportion of samples continued to have Ang-2 concentrations measured 
BLQ compared to at baseline (Figure 30).  
 
 
Figure 30. Aqueous Humor free Ang-2 Concentration. 
Rapid suppression of VEGF-A was shown starting 7 days post-dose and remained suppressed at least 
up to Week 20, after which patients were assigned to different dosing regimens. VEGF-A levels 
increased as the sampling time from most recent dose increased and were approaching baseline values 
16 weeks post-dose (Figure 31). 
 
 
 
Figure 31. Aqueous Humor Free VEGF-A concentrations. 
No change in plasma free Ang-2 or in free VEGF-A was observed post-dose as compared to baseline in 
any of the faricimab treatment arms. 
Study GR40844 (LUCERNE) 
High inter-patient variability was observed in AH Ang-2 (CV 35%-198%) and VEGF-A (CV 39%-103%) 
concentrations. 
Rapid suppression of Ang-2 starting 7 days post-dose was observed and maintained at least up to 
Week 20, after which patients were assigned to a regimen based on disease activity. The percentage of 
Ang-2 levels measured BLQ decreased as the time from last-dose increased. However, at 16 weeks 
after last dose, a higher proportion of samples continued to have Ang-2 concentrations measured BLQ 
compared to baseline (Figure 32).

Rapid suppression of VEGF-A was shown starting 7 days post-dose and remained suppressed at least 
up to Week 20, after which patients were assigned to different dosing regimens. VEGF-A levels 
increased as the sampling time from last-dose increased and were approaching baseline values 16 
weeks after the last dose (Figure 33).

Phase III studies in DME patients 
Study GR40349 (YOSEMITE)  
High inter-patient variability was observed in AH Ang-2 (CV 51-89% in the Q8W arm) and VEGF-A (CV 
80-222% in the Q8W arm) concentrations.  
Both faricimab arms showed rapid suppression of Ang-2 starting 7 days post-dose and mean 
concentrations remained below mean baseline throughout the study (Figure 34). 
 
 
 
 
Figure 34. Aqueous Humor Free Ang-2 Concentrations 
Both faricimab treatment arms showed rapid suppression of VEGF-A from day 7 onwards and 
thereafter sustained target suppression was observed in both arms. In the PTI arm, there was a trend 
for increased VEGF-A concentrations as sampling time from last dose increased (Figure 35).

High inter-patient variability was observed in AH Ang-2 (CV 60-87% in the Q8W arm) and VEGF-A (CV 
66-197% in the Q8W arm) concentrations. 
Both faricimab arms showed rapid suppression of Ang-2 starting 7 days post-dose and mean 
concentrations remained below mean baseline throughout the study (Figure 36).

Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac physiology 
No thorough QTc study has been performed with faricimab, as monoclonal antibodies are not known to 
cause QT prolongation, and faricimab plasma concentrations were low.  
Information on obtained ECG data during the clinical development of faricimab is provided in the 
Safety section of this report.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No PD interaction studies have been conducted. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses 
The analyses of exposure-efficacy relationships were performed by indication using the PK and efficacy 
data from Phase III studies in nAMD (GR40306 and GR40844) and DME (GR40349 and GR40398). The 
efficacy endpoints analysed were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), change from baseline in BCVA 
(dBCVA) and % change from baseline in BCVA (pdBCVA). Additional efficacy endpoints included, 
central subfield thickness (CST), change from baseline in CST (dCST) and % change from baseline of 
CST (pdCST). Different exposure metrics or predictors were used for inference between faricimab 
exposure and responses. The effect of relevant covariates (e.g. ADA) was assessed as appropriate. 
nAMD trials 
For BCVA, dBCVA, and pdBCVA and for CST, dCST and pdCST, there were no marked differences in 
response between different groups of VH elimination half-life (t1/2,kVH). Similarly, none of the three 
dosing groups (Q8W, Q12W, and Q16W) showed marked differences in response between the VH 
exposure categories (VH Ctrough,ss). The linear regression analyses suggested flat relationships 
between half-life or exposure and responses to faricimab treatment, with no apparent trends 
noticeable. 
The logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships between the probability of requiring a Q8W 
dose regimen and the probability of either a Q8W or Q12W regimen vs t1/2,kVH are presented in 
Figure 38 and Figure 39, respectively. Results showed that in patients with nAMD the probability of 
requiring a Q8W administration decreased with longer t1/2,kVH. The same trend was observed for the 
probability of receiving faricimab Q8W or Q12W.  
 
 
 
Figures 38 and 39. Logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships between the probability of 
requiring a Q8W dose regimen and the probability of either a Q8W or Q12W regimen vs t1/2,kVH 
The parameter estimates of the logistic regression final model are presented in Table 16. Probability of 
Q8W dosing was lower for ADA-positive patients, and it was higher for patients with higher baseline 
pigment epithelium detachment thickness (PEDT). No other covariates had a significant effect on 
probability of Q8W dosing. 
Table 16. Logistic regression of Q8W dosing in nAMD 
 
 
DME trials 
Arm A 
The time courses of BCVA, dBCVA, and pdBCVA by exposure categories (VH Ctrough,ss) showed no 
marked differences in response between the exposure categories. There was greater CST reduction in 
patients with higher exposure. The linear regression analyses suggested flat relationships between 
exposure and response (BCVA and CST) to faricimab treatment. 
Arm B 
For BCVA, dBCVA, and pdBCVA, there were no marked differences in response between number of 
administered doses between week 12 and 56. All three measures were higher in the lowest t1/2,kVH 
tertile, lower in the highest tertile, and similar to the control group in the intermediate t1/2,kVH tertile. 
Results of the linear regression analyses, did not demonstrate a trend deviating strongly from a flat 
relationship between the endpoints and their predictors. 
For CST, dCST and pdCST, there were no marked differences in response between number of 
administered doses between week 12 and 56. CST appeared to reach lower levels in patients with 
longer t1/2,kVH. Results of the linear regression analyses, did not demonstrate a trend deviating 
strongly from a flat relationship between the endpoints and their predictors. 
Table 17 shows the number and percent of patients in different dosing groups (defined by dosing 
schedules at Week 52) by tertiles of t1/2,kVH. Patients who needed fewer doses (i.e groups with 
longer inter-dose interval) tended to have longer t1/2,kVH. 
Table 17. Patients with different dosing regiments, by tertile of VH elimination half-life 
Logistic regression to assess the relationship between the dosing frequencies and the vitreous t1/2 is 
shown in Figure 40. The probability of Q4W regimen at Week 52 decreased with increasing vitreous 
t1/2. A similar trend was observed for the probability of a Q4W or Q8W regimen, as well as for a Q4W 
or Q8W or Q12W regimen. 
Figure 40. Logistic regression for probability of Dosing Intervals at w56 for DME studies. 
 
 
 
Table 18 shows the parameter estimates of the final logistic regression models. Low CST at baseline 
and longer VH t1/2 decrease the probability of Q4W regimen. The probability of Q12W or Q16W 
regimens was higher in NAIVE patients with long VH elimination half-life and low CST. The probability 
of Q16W regimen was higher in patients with low CST, longer VH elimination half-life and in patients 
with no cataract surgery.

Arms A and B combined 
Figure 41 illustrates the logistic regression models for the probability of disease activity at Week 16 
(DAW16) versus Ctrough,ss following Q4W dosing and versus the other exposure parameters. The 
probability of DAW16 declined with increasing Ctrough,ss but the relationship was shallow. The logistic 
regression models for the probability of DAW16 versus VH elimination rate and VH t1/2 also indicated 
shallow dependencies.

Ang-2 
For the Phase III studies, the relationships of free Ang-2 vs time after dose by VH Ctrough,ss (only 
Q16W regimen shown) and by VH t1/2 are illustrated in Figure 42 and Figure 43, respectively. For the 
Phase II study, the relationship between Ang-2 vs time after dose by VH Ctrough,ss is illustrated in 
Figure 44. Overall, the results indicated that groups with higher VH Ctrough,ss and longer VH t1/2 
have longer Ang-2 suppression and a higher fraction of BLQ observations.

respectively. For the Phase II study, the relationship between Ang-2 vs time after dose by VH 
Ctrough,ss is illustrated in Figure 50. No appreciable differences between patients with high and low 
VH exposure following 6 mg Q8W dosing were noticeable. In Arm B (PTI), patients with longer VH t1/2 
had longer Ang-2 suppression and higher fractions of BLQ observations.

Exposure-safety analyses 
The analyses of exposure-safety relationships were performed by indication, using the data of patients 
receiving faricimab in Phase III studies. As the onset of the safety events (intraocular inflammation, 
IOI) occurred mostly during the initial Q4W dosing period, the VH Ctrough,ss following 6 mg Q4W 
dosing regimen was used as a metric of exposure. The individual PK parameters from the final 
population PK model were used to predict individual VH Ctrough,ss. In addition, log(VH Ctrough,ss), 
VH elimination rate constant (kVH), and VH t1/2 were used as potential predictors of response. IOI 
was defined as binary 0/1 variable, irrespectively of the severity of the event or the number of 
occurrences. 
nAMD trials 
Table 26 shows incidence rates of IOI by tertiles of VH Ctrough,ss. The logistic regression models for 
VH Ctrough,ss, log(Ctrough,ss), kVH, and t1/2,kVH indicated that the probability of IOI did not 
increase with faricimab exposure. 
 
DME Trials 
Table 19 shows incidence rates of IOI by tertiles of VH Ctrough,ss. The logistic regression models for 
Ctrough,ss, log(Ctrough,ss), kVH, and t1/2,kVH indicated that the probability of IOI did not increase at 
higher exposures.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Faricimab, Ang-2, VEGF-A, ranibizumab, and aflibercept (as active comparators) concentrations were 
measured in aqueous humor and plasma, and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against faricimab in plasma 
samples. All available Phase III samples and faricimab and ADA Phase II and Phase I samples were 
analyzed using fully validated assays. The ADA assay strategy used a three-tiered approach. 
Generally, both the pre-study and in-study validations were appropriate and well documented. The 
concentration ranges were appropriate for the clinical trials. The methods were demonstrated to be 
precise and accurate for the analysis of human samples. The assays were carried out within the 
validated long-term stability period. 
In the case of the aflibercept assays in Phase II and Phase III studies many plasma and aqueous 
humor samples were analyzed significantly outside the validated stability.  
Population PK analysis of faricimab (RO6867461) 
The population PK analysis of faricimab was based on aqueous humour (AH) and plasma 
concentrations collected from patients with nAMD and DME in two Phase I, three Phase II, and four 
Phase III studies. The methods used for model development and evaluation are acceptable. Data 
exclusions were well documented and are acceptable. Post-dose BLQ observations were appropriately 
handled using the M3 method. 
 
 
 
Over the dosage range tested, a 3-compartment linear model, composed of the vitreous humour (VH) 
compartment, where the drug is injected, the AH compartment, and the plasma compartment 
adequately described faricimab concentration-time profiles. The VH volume was fixed to the literature 
value of 4.5 mL, which is considered acceptable. 
All final model parameters were estimated with adequate precision. There was high shrinkage (~50-
60%) of plasma CL and Vc as well as the AH elimination rate constant (KAH). However, the reliability of 
AH and systemic faricimab PK parameters, as reported in the SmPC, were adequately justified by the 
applicant. Importantly, shrinkage of KVH was low (5%). As such, predicted VH exposure and VH 
elimination half-life, which were used as predictors in the PK-PD analyses, can be considered reliable. 
The goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots indicated that the final model described the observed data 
adequately. The visual predictive checks showed that the final model captured both the central 
tendency and the interindividual variability of faricimab PK in AH and plasma reasonably well. However, 
the model does show deviations at the later time points, starting from around day 50. The Applicant 
acknowledged these shortcomings and argued that this is mainly due to the increasing number of BLQ-
values in the dataset. This can be followed. Nevertheless, respective simulations for later timepoints 
have to be interpreted with care. 
The covariates found to influence faricimab ocular PK parameters were age, formulation, and presence 
of ADAs, while faricimab systemic PK parameters were influenced by sex, body weight, and 
formulation. However, the effects of these covariates were considered not clinically meaningful (see 
Section 2.1.9 [Special Populations] for further discussion of the impact of relevant covariates). No 
other covariates (including race, patient disease characteristics at baseline, prior medication or 
treatment, fellow eye treatment, concomitant administration of drugs lowering IOP, hepatic or renal 
impairment) affected the faricimab PK parameters.  
Absorption 
•  Bioavailability 
Phase 1 studies 
In Study BP289936, following SAD and MAD dosing administered intravitreally to patients with nAMD, 
faricimab apparent t1/2 in AH ranged from 6-13 days, which is similar to the range of mean apparent 
t1/2 in plasma (6-15 days) and consistent with flip-flop kinetics. Faricimab concentrations in plasma 
were >100-fold lower than those in AH. Plasma faricimab exposure increased approximately dose-
proportionally up to 3 mg faricimab. No plasma accumulation was observed following Q4W 
administration, which is consistent with the apparent t1/2. 
In Study JP39844, following Q4W faricimab intravitreal administration at a dose of 1.5 or 6 mg for 3 
doses to Japanese patients with nAMD or DME, faricimab systemic exposure was generally within the 
range of the data in non-Japanese patients, with higher plasma concentrations following administration 
of 6 mg compared with 1.5 mg. Plasma faricimab t1/2 was similar at both dose levels with values 
ranging from 6-10 days. No plasma accumulation was observed following Q4W administration, 
consistent with faricimab t1/2. 
Phase II studies 
In Study CR39521 (STAIRWAY) in patients with nAMD, faricimab concentrations in plasma were >580-
fold lower than in AH. 
In Study BP29647 (AVENUE) in patients with nAMD, faricimab exposure in both AH and plasma was 
dose linear. Compared with AH, faricimab plasma concentrations were >400-fold lower. No plasma 
accumulation was observed following Q4W administration. 
In Study BP30099 (BOULEVARD) in patients with DME, faricimab concentrations in AH were around 3 
times higher following administration of 6 mg compared to 1.5 mg, and at both dose levels, 
concentrations declined in parallel for both doses following administration of the last administration. 
Faricimab plasma concentrations were >580-fold lower compared to AH, and were approximately 2-4 
times higher following administration of 6 mg compared to 1.5 mg. 
•  Bioequivalence 
A formal bioequivalence study between the formulations used in the clinical trials was not conducted. 
This is considered acceptable since the to-be-marketed formulation was used in the pivotal Phase III 
studies. 
Based on the population PK analysis, there was no difference in faricimab vitreous exposure between 
formulations. As such, a formulation effect on efficacy or safety would not be expected. It is agreed 
that the predicted difference in faricimab systemic exposure between the different formulations is 
unlikely to be of clinically relevance. 
Distribution and elimination 
The distribution of faricimab in the plasma is limited. The popPK estimate of apparent volume of 
distribution was 1.48 L. 
As expected, faricimab plasma clearance is higher than typical for monoclonal antibodies, which is 
consistent with the effect of the abolished binding of faricimab to the FcRn receptor. Slow elimination 
from the VH dominates faricimab kinetics. The elimination rate from the plasma compartment is 
around 17 times faster than the VH elimination rate. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Overall, faricimab exhibits approximately dose-proportional increases in exposure. Consistent with the 
PK and frequency of administration, there is minimal ocular or systemic accumulation of faricimab. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Intra-individual variability was not assessed. High inter-individual variability was observed in both AH 
and plasma faricimab exposure in the pivotal Phase III studies in nAMD and DME patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The AH and plasma PK of faricimab in the pivotal Phase III studies in patients with nAMD (TENAYA and 
LUCERNE) were similar and consistent with Phase II studies. In both studies, high inter-patient 
variability was observed in faricimab AH and plasma concentrations. Mean faricimab concentrations in 
plasma were approximately 450-fold and 560-fold lower than in AH in TENAYA and LUCERNE, 
respectively. 
The AH and plasma PK of faricimab in the pivotal Phase III studies in patients with DME (YOSEMITE 
and RHINE) were similar and consistent with Phase III studies in patients with nAMD. In both studies, 
high inter-patient variability was observed in faricimab AH and plasma concentrations. Mean faricimab 
concentrations in plasma were approximately 480-700-fold and 530-700-fold lower than AH 
concentrations in YOSEMITE and RHINE, respectively. 
The relationship between individual VH elimination rate estimates (KVH) from the population PK model 
and dosing frequency of faricimab in the Phase III studies suggested that patients with slower KVH and, 
hence, longer VH elimination half-life (longer retention of the drug in the VH) may need less frequent 
dosing. However, there was considerable overlap between the different dosing regimens. As such, 
variability in faricimab PK alone does not appear to fully explain the variability in response to faricimab 
treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
In the Phase I studies BP28936 and Study JP39844, no patients were ADA-positive at any time during 
either study. 
In the three Phase II studies STAIRWAY, AVENUE and BOULEVARD, the incidence of treatment-induced 
or treatment boosted ADA was relatively low (10.9%, 11.3% and 7.3%, respectively). In each of the 
studies, there was no apparent effect of ADA response on PK, safety or efficacy outcomes. However, 
this is based on a limited number of ADA-positive patients in each study. 
Consistent with Phase II studies, the incidence of faricimab ADAs was relatively low in the pivotal 
Phase III studies in patients with nAMD, TENAYA and LUCERNE; 8.8% and 11.9% of patients had 
treatment-emergent ADA respectively. No apparent influence of ADA on systemic exposure, overall 
safety or efficacy was observed based on the available data, acknowledging the limitation in the 
assessment due to the low number of ADA-positive patients. 
Also consistent with other studies, the incidence of faricimab ADAs was relatively low in the pivotal 
Phase III studies in patients with DME, YOSEMITE and RHINE; 10.0% and 6.9%, respectively. In each 
study, there was no apparent influence of ADAs on systemic exposure, overall safety or efficacy. 
However, this observation was based on a low number of ADA-positive patients. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Given that faricimab is eliminated by proteolytic catabolism, the lack of specific studies in patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment is acceptable. It is agreed that no dose adjustment of faricimab is 
warranted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Gender 
Plasma clearance of faricimab was slightly slower in females (~14%) compared to males. However, it 
is agreed that this difference is unlikely to be clinically relevant and, therefore, a dose adjustment of 
faricimab in terms of sex is not warranted. 
Race 
Race was not identified as a clinically relevant covariate in the population PK analysis. It is agreed that 
no dosage adjustment of faricimab is warranted in terms of race. 
Weight 
As with the majority of monoclonal antibodies, plasma clearance and volume of faricimab increased 
with increasing body. In DME patients, who are typically heavier than nAMD patients, the systemic 
faricimab exposure was ~10% lower compared to nAMD patients. It is agreed that this difference is 
unlikely to be clinically relevant and, therefore, a dose adjustment in terms of weight is not warranted. 
Elderly patients 
Age was identified as a significant covariate affecting the elimination rate from the VH, with VH half-life 
increasing with age. The VH half-life in a typical 44 year old patient had a VH half-life ~31% shorter 
than a typical 89 year of old patient. However, the age-related difference in the duration of faricimab 
VH exposure is not considered to be clinically relevant given the flat exposure relationship with BCVA. 
Therefore, it is agreed that a dose adjustment in elderly patients is not warranted. 
Interactions 
Since faricimab is a monoclonal antibody, the lack of formal drug-drug interaction studies is 
acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
Phase 1 studies 
In Study BP289936, whilst limited by the small sample size, the data suggest inhibition of Ang-2 and 
VEGF-A in AH following faricimab administration in nAMD patients. Faricimab administration resulted in 
a minor increase in plasma Ang-2 at Week 1, with no changes seen in plasma VEGF-A. Improvement in 
BCVA was observed at all dose levels in the SAD part, but only for the 6 mg dose in the MAD part. 
Decrease in CST was observed with a larger decrease observed for the 6 mg dose in the MAD part. 
Phase II studies 
In Study CR39521 (STAIRWAY) in patients with nAMD, exploratory PD assessments of AH samples 
from a subset of patients demonstrated suppression of Ang-2 and VEGA-A treated with faricimab 
including up to 8 weeks post-dose. However, there was a high level of non-quantifiable Ang-2 levels at 
baseline, limiting the interpretation of Ang-2 suppression data. 
In Study BP30099 (BOULEVARD) in patients with DME, Ang-2 and VEGF-A suppression was observed in 
AH with 1.5 mg and 6 mg Q4W regimens and remained below baseline for 8-12 weeks after the last 
administration of 6 mg. No apparent changes in the Ang-2 and VEGF-A plasma profiles were observed 
at the 1.5 or 6 mg dose levels. 
Phase III studies 
The PD of faricimab in both pivotal Phase III studies in patients with nAMD (TENAYA and LUCERNE) 
were similar. High inter-patient variability was observed in free Ang-2 and free VEGF-A AH and plasma 
concentrations. Suppression of Ang-2 and VEGF-A in AH was observed from Day 7 onwards in the 
faricimab treatment arms, which supports the proposed mechanism of action of faricimab. Suppression 
was maintained at least up to Week 20 after which patients were assigned to a regimen based on 
disease activity. Free VEGF-A and Ang-2 levels increased as the sampling time from most recent dose 
increased. No systemic target inhibition was observed. 
The PD of faricimab in both pivotal Phase III studies in patients with DME (YOSEMITE and RHINE) were 
similar and consistent with the results of the Phase III studies in patients with nAMD. High inter-
patient variability was observed in Ang-2 and VEGF-A concentrations. Suppression of free Ang-2 and 
free VEGF-A in AH was generally observed from day 7 onwards in faricimab treatment arms and free 
target concentrations remained below the average baseline at later visits. In the plasma, no change in 
the free Ang-2 and VEGF-A levels was observed after administration of Faricimab. This is in line with 
the low Faricimab levels observed in plasma. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No formal QTc study was performed with faricimab. This is acceptable since mAbs have a low likelihood 
for ion channel interactions and therefore thorough QT/QTc studies are not generally needed. Please 
see the Safety section of this report for discussion of ECG data from the clinical trials. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Pharmacodynamic interactions were not discussed by the Applicant. This is not unusual in clinical 
developments of monoclonal antibodies and is based on the argument that they are specific for their 
ligand(s) and unbound molecules are rapidly degraded into pharmacologically inactive peptides and 
amino acids. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses 
In patients with nAMD, the analyses suggested comparable increases in BCVA across the range of 
predictors. Similar results were observed in terms of decreases in CST. This supports the dosing 
algorithm used in the clinical trials since patients seem to have been appropriately allocated to the 
regimen that would likely lead to an optimal response. 
Results of the logistic regression analyses suggested that patients with longer VH t1/2 need less 
frequent dosing. This is as expected since patients with higher VH t1/2 will retain the drug longer in 
vitreous (the site of action). However, PK variability alone cannot fully explain the variability observed 
in response to treatment given the observed overlap in the distribution of VH t1/2 values between the 
different dosing regimens. 
The final logistic regression model suggested that, in addition of the VH t1/2, size of PEDT and the 
presence of ADA influence the dosing regimen. The larger the size of PEDT (more severe disease) the 
higher the probability of Q8W regimen, whilst ADA-positive patients had a lower likelihood of Q8W 
dosing. However, the difference in probability between the two groups for the Q8W regimen was 3.7%, 
which is not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Consistent with patients with nAMD, the analyses in DME patients suggested comparable increases in 
BCVA and comparable decreases in CST across the range of predictors. This supports the dosing 
algorithm used in the PTI treatment arm since patients seem to have been appropriately allocated to 
the regimen that would likely lead to an optimal response. This was also evidenced in the Q8W 
treatment arm by the flat relationship between faricimab exposure and the clinical endpoints. Also 
consistent with nAMD patients, the results suggested that patients with longer VH t1/2 need less 
frequent dosing. 
The probability of receiving different dosing regimens (Q4W, Q4W or Q8W, Q4W or Q8W or Q12W) was 
modelled using logistic regression and the VH t1/2. In addition to VH t1/2, the probability of receiving 
the Q4W regimen was influenced by the size of CST; the larger the size of CST the higher the 
probability of Q4W regimen. NAIVE patients had a lower probability to be in the Q4W or Q8W regimen 
compared to previously treated patients. The probability to be in the Q16W regimen was influenced by 
the size CST and cataract surgery; the smaller the size of CST and not having cataract surgery 
increased the probability of needing the Q16W regimen. However, the trials were not powered for 
assessment of such subsets within the PTI study and should only be considered as exploratory. The 
probability of less frequent dosing will likely be a multifactorial function of several patient-specific and 
disease-specific factors but also of previous treatments received. Therefore, additional data is required 
to prove or disprove the relationships between these patient characteristics and the durability of 
treatment effect. 
The probability of disease activity at Week 16 declined with increasing faricimab exposure (from 17.2% 
among patients in the lower exposure tertile to 12.5% among patients in the upper exposure tertile). 
However, the relationship was shallow. 
Graphical analysis of exposure-PD relationships 
In patients with nAMD, observed concentrations of free Ang-2 in AH declined from the median value of 
around 5 ng/L to undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and then increased when 
faricimab VH concentrations decayed. In the lower exposure groups, they returned to baseline level by 
week 16 post-dose. In patients with higher exposure, Ang-2 levels remained lower than the baseline 
level by week 16 post-dose. Patients with higher VH exposure and longer VH t1/2 had longer Ang-2 
suppression. 
Observed concentrations of free VEGF-A in AH declined from the median value of around 50 ng/L to 
nearly undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and rebounded when faricimab VH 
concentrations decayed. By week 16 post-dose, VEGF-A levels remained about half of baseline values. 
Patients with higher VH exposure and longer VH t1/2 had longer VEGF-A suppression. 
The group of patients with longer half-life had their median VEGF-A level increasing to ~20 pg/ml at 
around 12 weeks post dose. This means that, if the dosing regimens were based on VEGF suppression 
time, then at most only 50% of the patients would reach the Q12W regimen, which is a much lower 
percentage than what was observed in the Phase III nAMD trials. This suggests that VEGF-A inhibition 
alone cannot explain the observed response to faricimab treatment. 
In patients with DME, observed concentrations of free Ang-2 in AH declined from the median value of 
around 10 ng/L to undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and remained below 
quantification limit during Q8W dosing. No appreciable differences between patients with high and low 
VH exposure following 6 mg Q8W dosing were noticeable. This is explained by the fact that the Q8W 
regimen maintains the target maximally suppressed in all patients during the dosing interval and, 
therefore, no exposure-response is apparent. Among patients administered PTI dosing, patients with 
higher VH t1/2 had longer Ang-2 suppression. 
Observed concentrations of free VEGF-A in AH declined from the median value of around 100 ng/L to 
nearly undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and rebounded when faricimab 
concentrations decayed. By Week 4 post-dose, VEGF-A levels remained about 10 times lower than at 
baseline. By Week 12 post-dose, VEGF-A levels returned to baseline values. Patients with higher VH 
exposure and longer VH elimination half-life had longer VEGF-A suppression. The group of patients 
with longer half-life had their median VEGF-A level increasing to ~60 pg/ml at around 12 weeks post 
dose. This means that, if the dosing regimens were based on VEGF suppression time, then at most 
only 50% of the patients would reach a Q12W regimen, which is a much lower percentage than what 
was observed in the Phase III DME trials. This suggests that VEGF-A inhibition alone cannot explain the 
observed response to faricimab treatment. 
Overall, the results of the graphical analyses for Ang-2 and VEGF-A suggest a strong correlation 
between the lengths of time these biomarkers are suppressed and dosing regimens in both nAMD and 
DME patients. 
Exposure-safety analyses 
Overall, the analyses of exposure-safety relationships for nAMD and DME populations indicated that the 
total number of IOI events was low and the probability of IOI did not increase at higher vitreous 
faricimab exposures. 
It is noted that a higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive compared with ADA-negative 
patients. However, the applicant does not consider this observation to be clinically relevant. Please see 
Safety section for further discussion. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
After considering the submissions from the Applicant – including responses to questions raised by the 
CHMP – the product is approvable from a clinical pharmacology point of view. 
 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has sought the following indications for faricimab: 
• 
• 
treatment of adult patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration 
treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema. 
In support of the age-related macular degeneration indication, the Applicant has submitted two phase 
II studies AVENUE (BP29647) and STAIRWAY (CR39521), and two phase III studies TENAYA 
(GR40306) and LUCERNE (GR40844) which are similar studies. 
For the diabetic macular oedema indication the Applicant has submitted one phase II study 
BOULEVARD (BP30099) and two phase III studies RHINE (GR40398) and YOSEMITE (GR40349) which 
are also similar studies. 
The Applicant has confirmed that all studies were conducted under GCP conditions. However, during 
the compilation of this application, the Sponsor identified two breaches of GCP in the Phase III studies: 
1) potential unmasking of 3 patients due to an internal software update to the safety database and 2) 
unconsented optional plasma samples or optional aqueous humor samples were collected from a total 
of 235 patients (TENAYA: 52, LUCERNE: 23, YOSEMITE: 69, and RHINE: 91). Internal audits by the 
Sponsor did not identify any critical findings for the phase III studies. 
For the Phase II studies (STAIRWAY, AVENUE, and BOULEVARD), critical audit findings of non-
compliance with GCP were identified at one site, and appropriate corrective and preventive actions 
were implemented.   
 
 
Age-related macular degeneration indication  
 
 
 
 
 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
The applicant conducted two double blind randomised active controlled studies with ranibizumab 0.5mg 
intravitreally as the active control, AVENUE (BP29647) and STAIRWAY (CR39521) that could be 
construed as dose finding studies.  
The primary objective of the phase II AVENUE study was to evaluate the efficacy of RO6867461 
compared to ranibizumab monotherapy in treatment-naive and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) incomplete-responder patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-
related macular degeneration (AMD). The study duration was up to 40 weeks with a treatment duration 
of 32 weeks and efficacy evaluation at 36 weeks. 
The study was designed to allow the evaluation of RO6867461 in a treatment-naive patient population 
(comparison of Arms A, B, C, and D) and an anti-VEGF-incomplete-responder patient. The anti-VEGF-
incomplete-responder population is defined as a subgroup of patients from Arms A and E (Population 
C) with a BCVA ≤68 letters at Week 12. Only one eye per patient was chosen as the study eye. 
The study evaluated the following treatments: (A) 0.5 mg ranibizumab IVT every 4 weeks for 32 
weeks;  (B) 1.5mg faricimab administered 4- weekly for 32 weeks; (C) 6 mg faricimab IVT every 4 
weeks for 32 weeks; (D) 6 mg faricimab IVT every 4 weeks up to Week 12 (4 injections), followed by 6 
mg faricimab IVT every 8 weeks; (E) 0.5 mg ranibizumab IVT every 4 weeks up to Week 8 (3 
injections), followed by 6 mg faricimab IVT every 4 weeks (6 injections). 
The primary efficacy outcome measure in the treatment naive population (Population A; all patients 
randomized to Arms A, B, C and D) was the mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 36 using the 
ETDRS-modified charts. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure in the anti-VEGF-incomplete-responder population (Population 
C; all patients randomized to Arms A and E with a BCVA ≤68 at Week 12) was the mean change in 
BCVA from Week 12 baseline to Week 36. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters from baseline in 
BCVA and mean change from baseline in foveal centre point thickness at Week 36 amongst others. 
The primary endpoint of superiority of RO6867461 compared to 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W in the mean 
change of BCVA from baseline at Week 36 using ETDRS modified letter charts was not met. There was 
no statistically significant difference in BCVA outcomes in any faricimab treatment arm over 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab Q4W in the population of treatment-naïve patients with CNV secondary to AMD. The 6 mg 
faricimab Q8W (Arm D) provided numerically similar BCVA results to 6 mg faricimab Q4W (Arm C) 
dosing. Note the improvement from baseline in BCVA was numerically greater for the 1.5mg dose of 
faricimab. 
Pre-defined incomplete-responder analysis: 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W/6 mg faricimab Q4W treatment 
arm (Arm E) did not demonstrate additional benefit compared to 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arm in the 
protocol-defined incomplete-responder population (those not achieving 20/40 vision, or vision ≤68 
letters, after 3 monthly loading doses of 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W), Population C in either BCVA or 
OCT (CST). 
STAIRWAY 
The study was a multicenter, randomized, active comparator-controlled (ranibizumab), subject and 
outcome-assessor masked, parallel group (three treatment arms), 52-week study in treatment-naïve 
patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) conducted in the US. 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of faricimab on visual acuity when 
administered at 12- and 16- week intervals. 
 
 
Secondary efficacy objectives included evaluating the efficacy of faricimab on additional visual acuity 
outcomes, and anatomic outcome measures using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-
OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). 
The study evaluated the following treatments: (A) 6 mg faricimab every 12 weeks (Q12W arm) (i.e. 6 
mg faricimab IVT Q4W up to Week 12, followed by 6 mg faricimab IVT Q12W up to Week 48); (B) 6 
mg faricimab every 16 weeks (Q16W arm) (i.e 6 mg faricimab IVT Q4W up to Week 12 (4 injections), 
followed by 6 mg faricimab IVT Q16W up to Week 48). A protocol-defined assessment of disease 
activity at Week 24 required Arm B patients with active disease to then receive a Q12W dosing interval 
of 6 mg faricimab for the remainder of the study. The comparator was ranibizumab 0.5mg IVT 4 
weekly for 48 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 
Week 40 using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like charts. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: mean change from baseline BCVA over time using 
the ETDRS-like charts, proportion of patients gaining ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or ≥ 0 letters from baseline 
BCVA over time, Mean change from baseline in mean central subfield thickness CST over time amongst 
others. 
At Week 40, the adjusted mean BCVA change from baseline in the study eye was 9.3, 12.5 and 11.4 
letters (ETDRS) in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W 
arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA between the 6 mg 
faricimab Q12W and Q16W dosing arms when compared to the control 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arm 
at Week 40 was -2.1 (CI -6.8, 2.6) and 1.1 (CI-3.4, 5.5) letters, respectively. 
At Week 52, the adjusted mean BCVA change from baseline in the study eye was 10.1, 11.4, and 9.6 
letters (ETDRS) for the 6 mg faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W 
arms, respectively (Table 9). The difference between the 6 mg faricimab Q12W and Q16W dosing arms 
when compared to the control 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arm, respectively, was 0.5 (CI -4.3, 5.3) and 
1.8 (CI -2.7, 6.4) letters at Week 52, respectively. 
 
At Week 52, 33.3%, 46.4%, and 37.5% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from 
baseline in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arms, 
respectively. The difference between the 6 mg faricimab Q12W and 6 mg faricimab Q16W arms when 
compared to 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arms in the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 
letters from baseline at Week 52 was -4.2% (CI -24.5, 16.2) and 8.9% (CI -10.7, 28.6), respectively. 
At baseline, the mean CFT assessed on SD-OCT was 290.8 µm, 280.8 µm, 375.6 µm for the 6 mg 
faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arms, respectively. On average, 
CFT values in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arms, 
showed rapid decreases after the first treatment injection with final adjusted mean CFT changes from 
baseline at Week 52 of -141.0, -135.0, -136.1 µm in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W, 6 mg faricimab Q16W 
and 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arms, respectively 
 
 
 
Main study(ies) 
For the neovascular age-related macular degeneration indication the applicant has submitted two 
phase III randomised, double-masked, active comparator (aflibercept) controlled studies that have the 
same design, inclusion and exclusion criteria and efficacy endpoints. Both studies are ongoing. 
•  Study GR40306 (TENAYA) enrolled its first patient on 19 February 2019. The last patient in the 
trial was randomised on 19 November 2019. The data cut off was 26 October 2020.  
•  Study GR40844 (LUCERNE) enrolled its first patient on 11 March 2019. The last patient was 
randomised on 1 November 2019 and the data cut off point was 5 October 2020.  
Study GR40306 (TENAYA) and Study GR40844 (LUCERNE)  
Methods 
TENAYA and LUCERNE are Phase III, multicenter, randomized, active comparator-controlled, double-
masked, parallel-group, 112-week studies to investigate the efficacy, safety, durability, and 
pharmacokinetics of faricimab administered at up to 16-week intervals to treatment-naive patients 
with nAMD. Figure 54 presents an overview of the study design. 
Figure 54. Study Schema for TENAYA and LUCERNE. 
 
Study Participants 
The study population was made up of treatment naive patients with neovascular AMD. Patients had to 
have a functioning non-study eye. As part of the screening process, the central reading center (CRC) 
evaluated CFPs, FFA, and OCT images to provide an objective, masked assessment of patient 
eligibility.

pharmacological intervention, argon laser photocoagulation, verteporfin photodynamic therapy, diode 
laser, transpupillary thermotherapy, or ocular surgical intervention. 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to Arm A received 6 mg of intravitreal faricimab Q4W up to Week 12. At Week 20, 
protocol-defined assessment of disease activity required patients in Arm A with active disease to be 
treated with a Q8W dosing regimen of 6 mg of faricimab (i.e., injections at Weeks 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 
and 60). 
A second protocol-defined assessment of disease activity at Week 24 required patients in Arm A with 
active disease (excluding those with active disease at Week 20 and therefore receiving a Q8W dosing 
regimen of 6 mg of intravitreal faricimab) to be treated with a Q12W dosing regimen of 6 mg of 
intravitreal faricimab (i.e., injections at Weeks 24, 36, 48, and 60). 
Patients receiving faricimab who did not have active disease according to the protocol-defined criteria 
at Week 20 and Week 24 were treated with 6 mg of intravitreal faricimab Q16W (i.e., injections at 
Weeks 28, 44, and 60). 
From Week 60 (when all patients in Arm A are scheduled to receive study drug) to Week 108, patients 
in Arm A will be treated according to a PTI dosing regimen (between Q8W and Q16W). At study drug 
dosing visits, treatment intervals can be maintained or adjusted (i.e., increased by 4 weeks or 
decreased by 4 or 8 weeks), based on OCT, BCVA, and clinical assessment). This part of the study is 
not complete yet. 
Patients randomized to the active comparator (Arm B), received a 2 mg dose of intravitreal aflibercept 
administered Q8W after 3 consecutive monthly doses during the 108-week treatment period (see 
Figure 54).  
Both treatment arms (faricimab up to Q16W and aflibercept Q8W) maintained Q4W study visits for the 
duration of the study.  
Dose modification was not allowed during the study. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal injections of the 6 mg dose of 
faricimab on BCVA outcomes compared with aflibercept There were a number of secondary objectives 
relating to other BCVA outcomes and anatomic measures.  
The primary comparison was to test non-inferiority of faricimab (up to Q16W) compared with 
aflibercept (Q8W), as measured by the primary endpoint - change from baseline in BCVA averaged 
over Weeks 40, 44, and 48, in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The non-inferiority test was 
conducted with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters at the one-sided 0.02485 significance level. 
The null hypothesis: H0: µfaricimab-µaflibercept ≤- 4 letters, and the alternative hypothesis: Ha: 
µfaricimab-µaflibercept >- 4 letters, were tested, where µfaricimab and µaflibercept are the expected 
change from baseline in BCVA averaged over Weeks 40, 44, and 48 for the faricimab and aflibercept 
arms respectively. If the lower bound of a two-sided 95.03% CI for the difference in adjusted means of 
the two treatments was greater than - 4 letters (the non-inferiority margin), then faricimab was 
considered non-inferior to aflibercept. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline BCVA (as assessed on the ETDRS chart at a 
starting distance of 4 meters based on the average at Weeks 40, 44 and 48). There were a number of 
secondary endpoints related to visual function, frequency of study drug administration and anatomical 
endpoints such as:  
•  Change from baseline in BCVA over time 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients gaining ≥15, ≥10, ≥5, or ≥0 letters in BCVA from baseline averaged 
over Weeks 40, 44, and 48 and over time 
Proportion of patients avoiding loss of ≥15, ≥10 or ≥5 letters in BCVA from baseline averaged 
over Weeks 40, 44, and 48 and over time 
Proportion of patients in the faricimab arm on a Q8W, Q12W, and Q16W treatment interval at 
Weeks 48, 60, and 112 
•  Number of study drug injections received through Weeks 48, 60, and 112 
•  Change from baseline in CST(ILM-RPE) based on an average at Weeks 40, 44, and 48 and over 
time 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
After written informed consent was obtained, all patients received a screening number assigned 
through the IxRS. A patient had to have satisfied all eligibility criteria prior to randomization through 
the IxRS. As part of the screening process, the central reading center (CRC) evaluated CFPs, FFA, and 
OCT images to provide an objective, masked assessment of patient eligibility. After all patient eligibility 
requirements were confirmed, site personnel contacted the IxRS at the Day 1 visit for assignment of a 
patient identification number (a separate number from the screening number). Patients were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms (faricimab up to Q16W or aflibercept Q8W). 
After randomization and at each study treatment visit (i.e., including Day 1), the IxRS assigned the 
appropriate study treatment kit to be used. Patients were randomized on the same day study 
treatment was to be initiated (the Day 1 visit). 
Randomization was stratified by the following baseline factors (Day 1): 
•  Baseline BCVA ETDRS letter score (≥ 74 letters, 73-55 letters, and ≤ 54 letters) 
 
• 
Low luminance deficit (LLD) (< 33 letters, and ≥ 33 letters) 
•  Region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world) 
A stratified permuted-block randomization scheme was used to obtain approximately a 1:1 ratio 
among the treatment groups overall and within each of the above strata. 
Screen fail patients were eligible for two additional re-screens during the enrolment period of the 
study. At re-screening, a new screening number was assigned to each patient through the IxRS and all 
screening visit assessments were performed. Only FFA images did not have to be repeated, provided 
that the same eye was selected for the study eye at re-screening and acceptable FFA images were 
received by the CRC within 4 weeks before the new Day 1 visit (randomization) date. 
The studies were double-masked study. A minimum of two investigators per site were needed to fulfill 
the masking requirements of this study, and a masked and unmasked investigator are required to be 
present at each scheduled study visit. Patients received a sham injection at each 4 week visit where 
they were not due active treatment. The sham is a procedure that mimics an intravitreal injection and 
involves the blunt end of an empty syringe (without a needle) being pressed against the anesthetized 
eye.  
Sample Size 
A sample size of approximately 320 patients in each arm provided greater than 
90% power to show non-inferiority of faricimab to aflibercept in the change in BCVA 
averaged over Weeks 40, 44, and 48 in the ITT population, using a non-inferiority margin 
of 4 letters, and under the following assumptions: 
- No difference in the mean change from baseline in BCVA between two treatment 
arms; 
- Standard deviation of 14 letters for the change from baseline in BCVA averaged 
over Weeks 40, 44, and 48; 
- Two-sample t-test; 
- 2.5% one-sided type I error rate; 
- 10% dropout rate. 
Estimand and Estimator 
The primary Estimand was described as follows: 
Population: Adult treatment-naive patients with nAMD, as defined by the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (ITT Population); 
Variable: Change in BCVA score from baseline averaged over Weeks 40, 44, 
and 48. BCVA score was based on the ETDRS VA chart assessed at a starting 
distance of 4 meters; 
Population-level summary: Difference in adjusted mean between faricimab (up to 
Q16W) and aflibercept (Q8W) arms 
Intercurrent events: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs or lack of efficacy not due to COVID-19: A treatment 
policy strategy was applied where all observed values were used regardless of the occurrence of the 
intercurrent event. 
– Use of any prohibited systemic treatment or prohibited therapy in the study eye not due to COVID-
19: A treatment policy strategy was applied where all observed values will be used regardless of the 
occurrence of the intercurrent event. 
– Discontinuation of study treatment due to COVID-19: A hypothetical strategy was applied where all 
values were censored after the intercurrent event. 
– Use of any prohibited systemic treatment or prohibited therapy in the study eye due to COVID-19: A 
hypothetical strategy was applied where all values were censored after the intercurrent event. 
– Missed dose(s) with potentially major impact on efficacy due to COVID-19: A hypothetical strategy 
was applied where all values were censored after the intercurrent event 
– COVID-19 death: A hypothetical strategy was applied. 
The primary analysis was performed using a MMRM. The model included the change from baseline at 
Weeks 4 to 48 as the response variable and included the categorical covariates of treatment group, 
visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), as well as randomization 
stratification factors as fixed effects. Comparisons between the two treatment arms were made using a 
composite contrast over Weeks 40, 44, and 48. The MMRM model assumed an unstructured covariance 
structure, as pre-specified in the SAP. All MMRM analyses used an unstructured covariance structure. 
Missing data were implicitly imputed by the MMRM model, assuming a missing at random missing data 
mechanism. Non-standard BCVA data (BCVA testing performed incorrectly) were excluded from the 
analyses. 
Results 
TENAYA  participant flow 
A total of 989 patients were screened, of which 318 patients failed screening, mainly due to not 
meeting the ocular inclusion criteria of subfoveal CNV or juxtafoveal/extrafoveal CNV with a subfoveal 
component (63 patients); CNV lesion of any type that exhibits all four characteristics listed in Section 
3.5.1.2 (59 patients); BCVA of 78-24 letters, inclusive (n = 39); or meeting the exclusion criteria on 
FFA/CFP. A total of 671 treatment naive patients were randomized: 334 to the faricimab arm and 337 
to the aflibercept arm (Figure 55) in 149 sites in 15 countries. 
As specified in the protocol, three randomization stratification factors were used (baseline BCVA ETDRS 
letter score, LLD, and region) to balance these characteristics between the treatment arms 
Two patients (1 patient in the faricimab arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept arm) were randomized but 
did not receive treatment, both due to physician decision.  
Completion rates of study treatment at week 48 were high in both treatment groups 92.2% in the  
faricimab arm and 95.5% in the aflibercept arm. 
LUCERNE 
A total of 1012 patients were screened, of which 354 patients failed screening, most commonly due to 
not meeting inclusion criteria (227 patients). The main reasons for screen failure were not meeting the 
ocular inclusion criteria of subfoveal CNV or juxtafoveal/extrafoveal CNV with a subfoveal component 
 
 
(65 patients); CNV lesion of any type that exhibits all the characteristics listed in Section 3.5.1.2 (70 
patients); BCVA of 78 to 24 letters, inclusive (26 patients); or meeting the exclusion criteria on 
FFA/CFP (54 patients). A total of 658 treatment-naive patients with nAMD were randomized 1:1 into 
the study: 331 to the faricimab arm and 327 to the aflibercept arm (Figure 2) in 122 sites in 20 
countries. 
One patient in the aflibercept arm was randomized but did not receive treatment due to a reason of 
“other” (not eligible).  
Treatment completion rates at Week 48 were high in both treatment arms 94.6% in the faricimab arm 
and 93.3% in the aflibercept arm. 
Reasons for discontinuation prior to Week 48 were broadly similar in both treatment arms in both 
studies. 
Note both studies experienced mis-stratification of patients.

comparable between treatment arms. Overall, the baseline absence of PED was comparable between 
the treatment arms (8.7% of patients in the faricimab arm and 7.7% in the aflibercept arm) but the 
mean (SD) baseline PED height was numerically greater in the faricimab arm (125.3 [161.0] µm vs. 
116.9 [149.4] µm in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. At baseline, CNV lesion location 
(determined by FFA) was most commonly subfoveal (57.7%), followed by juxtafoveal (26.2%), and 
extrafoveal (14.3%). The most common CNV lesion types were occult (52.3%), classic (23.4%), and 
minimally classic (9.2%); this was comparable between treatment arms. Mean total area of CNV lesion

intraretinal fluid was absent in 54% of patients, subretinal fluid was absent in 31.9% of patients, and 
pigment epithelial detachment was absent in 7.6% of patients; this was comparable between 
treatment arms. Overall, the baseline absence of PED was comparable between the treatment arms 
(6.9% of patients in the faricimab arm and 8.3% in the aflibercept arm), but the mean (SD) baseline 
PED height in the study eye was numerically greater in the faricimab arm (140.8 [170.9] µm vs. 108.2 
[139.4] µm in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. At baseline, CNV lesion location 
(determined by FFA) was most commonly subfoveal (60.8%), followed by juxtafoveal (23.9%), and

Numbers analysed 
 
 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the ITT population. 
TENAYA 
The ITT population included 671 patients (see Table 21). 
Two patients were randomized but did not receive treatment and were not included in the safety 
population. Overall, 92 patients were excluded from the PP population due to protocol deviations (90 
patients had major protocol deviations that impacted the efficacy evaluation or the treatment interval 
determination, and 2 patients were not dosed). 
LUCERNE 
The ITT population included 658 patients (Table 21). One patient was randomized but did not receive 
treatment and was not included in the safety population. Overall, 81 patients were excluded from the 
PP population due to protocol deviations (80 patients had major protocol deviations that impacted 
efficacy evaluation or the treatment interval determination, and 1 patient was not dosed.

Primary endpoint 
TENAYA 
At Week 40/44/48, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 5.8 and 5.1 letters in the 
faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in 
BCVA between the faricimab arm when compared with the aflibercept arm at Week 40/44/48 was 0.7 
letters (95% CI: - 1.1, 2.5) 
 
 
 
 
LUCERNE 
At Week 40/44/48, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 6.6 and 6.6 letters in the 
faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in 
BCVA between the faricimab arm when compared with the aflibercept arm at Week 40/44/48 was 0.0 
letters (95% CI - 1.7, 1.8) (Table 23). 
For the primary efficacy analysis, a hypothetical strategy was applied for COVID-19 related intercurrent 
events where all values were censored after such intercurrent event. The primary analysis assessed in 
the ITT population excluded measurements after COVID-19 related intercurrent events (hypothetical 
strategy) and was performed based on all other observed data (treatment policy strategy for non-
COVID-19 related intercurrent events), with the missing data imputed implicitly under the MAR 
assumption. 
The following sensitivity/supplemental analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results 
using the same MMRM method as the main analysis, but applying different handling strategies for the 
intercurrent events and missing data: 
• 
• 
LOCF: missing BCVA assessments due to any reason were imputed using the last available 
post-baseline observation prior to the occurrence of missing data (sensitivity analysis) 
Treatment policy strategy for all intercurrent events 
•  Hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events.  
In addition, the following analyses were also performed using the ANCOVA method and different 
handling strategies for the intercurrent events and missing data: 
1. 
Trimmed means analysis performed using a truncated distribution, truncating patients with 
the worst outcome, with the assumption that patients have the worst outcome after non-
COVID-19 related intercurrent events. Missing data and measurements after COVID-19 
related intercurrent events, as well as missing data due to other reasons, were considered 
MAR and were censored  
2. 
ANCOVA analysis with the average of non-missing values of Weeks 40, 44, and 48 
assessments as the dependent variable. Measurements after COVID-19 related intercurrent 
events were censored and missing observations were not imputed 
3. 
Multiple imputation, assuming a missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism for non-COVID-
19 related missingness. Missing data and measurements after COVID-19 related intercurrent 
events, as well as missing data due to other reasons, were imputed using multiple imputation 
method assuming MAR.

ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; CI = confidence interval; 
COVID-19 = Coronavirus Disease 2019; ITT = intent-to-treat; LLD = low luminance deficit; MMRM = 
mixed-model repeated measurement; LOCF = last observation carried forward; PP = per-protocol. For 
the MMRM analysis, the model is adjusted for treatment arm, visit, visit-by-treatment arm interaction, 
baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA (≥ 74 letters, 73–55 letters, and ≤ 54 letters), baseline 
LLD (< 33 letters and ≥ 33 letters), and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the 
world). An unstructured covariance structure is used. The estimate of the difference between the two 
arms uses a composite contrast over Weeks 40, 44, and 48.  
For the primary estimand and LOCF analyses, treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were 
applied to non-COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively. For the 
treatment policy analysis, observed BCVA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of 
intercurrent events. For the hypothetical strategy analysis, hypothetical strategy was applied to non-
COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events. For the MMRM analyses, missing data 
were implicitly imputed by MMRM. For the LOCF analyses, missing data were imputed using the last 
post-baseline observation carried forward. Invalid BCVA values are excluded from analysis. 95% CI is a 
rounding of 95.03% CI. 
a.Units: letters. For the primary analysis, if the lower bound of a two-sided 95% CI for the difference 
in adjusted means of the two treatments is greater than -4 letters (the non-inferiority margin), then 
faricimab is considered non-inferior to aflibercept. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
TENAYA 
 
Change from Baseline in BCVA over Time 
The change from baseline in BCVA through Week 48 was comparable between the faricimab and 
aflibercept arms. The results for change from baseline in BCVA through Week 48 for the sensitivity 
analysis and supplementary analyses were consistent with the main analysis. At all times in the 
TENAYA study BCVA gains from baseline was numerically greater for faricimab than aflibercept. This 
was also noted for the LUCERNE study but only up to week 36. Efficacy appeared similar in both 
treatment arms from Week 36 to Week 48.

Change from Baseline in Central Subfield Thickness at Week 40/44/48 
At Week 40/44/48, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -136.8 µm and -129.4 µm for 
the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively in the TENAYA study (Table 25). The difference in 
adjusted mean change from baseline in CST between the faricimab arm when compared to the 
aflibercept arm at Week 40/44/48 was - 7.4 µm (95% CI: - 15.7, 0.8). Change from baseline over 
time to week 48 was similar in both treatment arms (Figure 56). Similar changes were seen in the 
LUCERNE study. At Week 40/44/48, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -137.1 µm 
and -130.8 µm for the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively (Table 25). The difference in 
adjusted mean change from baseline in CST between the faricimab arm when compared to the

Patients treated with faricimab had a comparable mean change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 
composite score at Week 24 and Week 48 compared with patients treated with aflibercept. At Week 
48, the descriptive mean (SD) change from baseline in NEI VFQ-25 composite score was 4.82 (10.81) 
and 2.54 (10.93) in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. In the LUCERNE study, the 
descriptive mean (SD) change from baseline at Week 48 in NEI VFQ-25 composite score was 4.35 
(10.65) and 5.55 (11.17) in the faricimbab and aflibercept arms respectively. 
Ancillary analyses 
The primary endpoint of the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 40/44/48 was 
analyzed across subgroups including: 
•  Baseline BCVA (≥ 74 letters, 73-55 letters, and ≤ 54 letters) 
•  Region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world) 
• 
LLD (< 33 letters and ≥ 33 letters) 
•  Choroidal neovascularization lesion subtype (classic, minimally classic, and occult) 
• 
Total CNV lesion area (< 1 mm2, 1-3 mm2, and > 3 mm2) 
•  CNV lesion size (< 1 mm2, 1-3 mm2, and > 3 mm2) 
•  Age (< 75 years and ≥ 75 years) 
•  Gender 
•  Race (White, Asian, and other) 
The differences in mean change in BCVA at Week 40/44/48 between the two treatment arms across 
subgroups were consistent with those of the overall population. In the ITT population, BCVA analyzed 
across subgroups was generally consistent with the overall population.

For the MMRM analysis, the model adjusted for treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group 
interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA (≥74 letters, 73-55 letters, ≤54 letters), 
baseline LLD (<33 letters, ≥33 letters) and region North America, Asia and rest of the world). The 
stratification factor is excluded if it is the subgroup. An unstructured covariance structure is used. The 
estimate of the difference between the two groups uses a composite contrast over Weeks 40, 44 and 
48. Treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were applied to non-COVID-19 related and 
COVID-19 related inter-current events, respectively. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. 
Invalid BCVA values are excluded from analysis. 
In general the differences in mean change in BCVA at Week 40/44/48 between the two treatment arms 
across subgroups were consistent with those of the overall population. However within sub-groups 
there appears to be a pattern showing greater numerical improvement in BCVA from baseline in both 
treatment arms in specific groups within sub-groups e.g. those with a baseline BCVA of ≤ 54 letters, 
those with a low luminance deficiency of < 33 letters, those aged < 75 years, those with classic lesions 
and those with smaller lesion size.

In TENAYA and LUCERNE at Week 60, 79.8% and 78.4% of patients, respectively, in the faricimab 
dosing arm were on a fixed dosing regimen of Q12W or Q16W. In TENAYA, the proportions of 
faricimab-treated patients on a fixed Q8W, Q12W or Q16W treatment interval at Week 60 were 20.2%, 
33.4% and 46.4%. In LUCERNE, the proportions of faricimab-treated patients on a fixed Q8W, Q12W, 
or Q16W treatment interval at Week 60 were 21.6%, 32.8%, and 45.6%. In the pooled ITT population 
at Week 60, 79.1% of patients in the faricimab dosing arm were on a fixed Q12W or Q16W dosing 
regimen. Overall, 20.9%, 33.1%, and 46.0% of patients were on a fixed Q8W, Q12W, and Q16W 
dosing regimen at Week 60. Percentages are based on the number of patients randomized to the 
 
faricimab arm who had not discontinued the study at Week 60.

Diabetic macular oedema 
In support of the indication the applicant submitted one phase II study (BOULEVARD BP30099) that 
could be construed as a dose finding study and two phase III (RHINE and YOSEMITE) main studies. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
BOULEVARD was a multiple-center, multiple dose, randomized, active comparator controlled 
(ranibizumab 0.3mg), double-masked, three parallel group study in patients with diabetic macular 
oedema. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of faricimab compared with the active 
comparator ranibizumab in treatment naive patients with center-involving diabetic macular edema 
(CIDME). 
Secondary efficacy objectives included exploring the duration of effect of RO6867461 
The three treatments arms of this study were as follows (see Figure 57): 
•  Arm A: 0.3 mg ranibizumab IVT 
•  Arm B: 1.5 mg RO6867461 IVT 
•  Arm C: 6 mg RO6867461 IVT 
The total duration of the study for each patient was up to 40 weeks, with screening up to 4 weeks, 
study treatment period from Day 1(baseline) to Week 20, an observational period from week 20 to 
week 36 or earlier and a safety follow-up call during the observation period and 7 days after 
ranibizumab administration. All treatments were administered every 4 weeks. 
Up to 210 patients were planned to be randomized, including approximately 150 treatment-naive 
patients and approximately 60 patients who had been previously treated with IVT anti-VEGF. 
Approximately 50 treatment-naive patients were planned to be randomized into each arm (1:1:1 
randomization scheme) and approximately 30 patients previously treated with IVT anti-VEGF were to 
be randomized into arms A and C. 
Patients had to meet the following criteria for inclusion:  
•  Macular oedema associated with diabetic retinopathy defined as macular thickening by spectral 
domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) involving the center of the macula: central 
subfield thickness (CST) of ≥325 µm with Spectralis® (Heidelberg) at screening (where 
Spectralis was not available, the following devices and CST thresholds were acceptable: CST 
≥315 µm for CirrusTM, CST ≥315 µm for TopconTM, CST ≥295 µm for OptovueTM) 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
•  Decreased visual acuity attributable primarily to DME, with BCVA letter score of 73-24 letters 
(inclusive) on ETDRS-like charts (20/40-20/320 Snellen equivalent) on Day 1 
•  Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow acquisition of good quality retinal 
images to confirm diagnosis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in BCVA (ETDRS letters) from baseline at Week 24 in 
treatment-naive patients. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: proportion of patients gaining ≥15 
letters from baseline BCVA at Week 24; mean change from baseline in foveal center point thickness 
(FCPT, also referred to as Central Retinal Thickness [CRT]) at Week 24. Analysis of the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints was also carried out in  the previously treated population. 
In total, 168 treatment-naive patients were randomized into Study BP30099, 59 to the 0.3 mg 
ranibizumab arm, 54 to the 1.5 mg RO6867461 arm, and 55 to the 6 mg RO6867461 arm (Table 29). 
Two patients in the 6 mg RO6867461 arm were excluded from the analysis populations due to GCP 
non-compliance at a single site. 
A total of 61 patients who had received prior anti-VEGF treatment were randomized: 31 to the 0.3 mg 
ranibizumab arm and 29 to the 6 mg RO6867461 arm. One previously treated patient was incorrectly 
randomized to the 1.5 mg RO6867461 arm; this patient was excluded from the efficacy analyses.

population 
In the treatment-naive patient population, the mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 
resulted in a statistically significant +3.6 ETDRS-letter difference in the 6 mg RO6867461 arm 
compared with the 0.3 mg ranibizumab arm (p=0.03, 80% CI: 1.5, 5.6; Table 30); the difference for 
the 1.5 mg RO6867461 arm compared with the 0.3 mg ranibizumab arm was not statistically 
significant (+1.4 letters, p=0.37, 80% CI:-0.6, 3.4). 
The adjusted (by MMRM model) absolute mean change from baseline at Week 24 was 10.3, 11.7, and 
13.9 ETDRS-letters for the 0.3 mg ranibizumab, 1.5 mg RO6867461, and 6 mg RO6867461 arms 
respectively. 
Table 30. Summary of mean change from baseline in BCVA 
 
 
Secondary endpoints 
For previously treated patients, the model-based changes from baseline were 8.3 and 9.6 letters for 
0.3 mg ranibizumab and 6 mg RO6867461 arms, respectively. The difference of +1.3 letters was not 
statistically significant (p=0.63, 80% CI:-2.3, 5.0). The unadjusted mean change from baseline at 
Week 24 was 9.3, and 11.1 letters for the 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 6 mg RO6867461 arms, 
respectively (Table 31). 
In the total All Patients (ITT) population (both treatment-naive and previously treated patients), the 
effect was smaller than for the treatment-naive population, but still statistically significant (p=0.04, 
80% CI: 1.1, 4.8) with +2.9 letter difference in the 6 mg RO6867461 arm compared with the 0.3 mg 
ranibizumab arm. In the 1.5 mg RO6867461 arm the difference at Week 24 to 0.3 mg ranibizumab 
was not statistically significant with a change of +2.3 letters from baseline (p=0.15, CI: -0.2, 4.3). The 
absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was 9.4, 11.7, and 12.3 letters for the 0.3 mg ranibizumab, 
1.5 mg RO6867461, and 6 mg RO6867461 treatment arm, respectively. 
 
 
 
Table 31. BCVA change from baseline at Week 24 
. Starting from Week 8 up to Week 24, patients in both 1.5 mg RO6867461 and 6 mg RO6867461 
arms had a numerically higher proportion of patients gaining ≥15 letters BCVA than patients in the 0.3 
mg ranibizumab arm. 
At Week 24, 36.7% and 43.2% of observed treatment-naive patients in the 1.5 mg RO6867461and 6 
mg RO6867461 arms, respectively, gained ≥15 letters from baseline compared with 32.7% of patients 
in the 0.3 mg ranibizumab arm (Table 32). 
The proportions of previously-treated patients gaining ≥15 letters at Week 24 were 17.9% and 26.1% 
for the 0.3 mg ranibizumab and 6 mg RO6867461 treatment arms respectively (Table 32).

The adjusted mean difference in FCPT change from baseline at Week 24 was -6.5 µm and -22.8 µm 
between 0.3 mg ranibizumab and the 1.5 mg RO6867461 and 6 mg RO6867461 arms, respectively in 
the treatment naïve population.  
For the previously treated patient population, the adjusted mean difference in FCPT change from 
baseline at Week 24 was also not statistically significant (-49.2 µm, p=0.07) for the 6 mg RO6867461 
treatment arm compared with the 0.3 mg ranibizumab arm. The difference in mean change from 
baseline at Week 24 in the reduction of FCPT for the All Patients population was statistically significant 
for the 6 mg RO6867461 arm compared with the 0.3 mg ranibizumab arm (-29.2 µm, p=0.05, 80% 
CI: -47.8,-10.6). 
 
The absolute mean change from baseline at Week 24 was -212.1 µm, -260.2 µm, and -227.8 µm for 
0.3 mg ranibizumab, 1.5 mg RO6867461, and 6 mg RO6867461, respectively (Table 33).

Study GR40398 (RHINE): A Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Masked, Active 
Comparator-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Faricimab in Patients with Diabetic 
Macular Edema. Report No. 1102957 
Study GR40349 (YOSEMITE): A Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Masked, Active 
Comparator-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Faricimab (RO6867461) in Patients 
with Diabetic Macular Edema. Report No. 1102956 
Methods 
RHINE and YOSEMITE are Phase III, double-masked, multicenter, randomized, active comparator-
controlled, parallel-group studies, evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and optimal 
treatment frequency of faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 8-week intervals or PTI of 
approximately 100 weeks' duration (excluding the screening period) to patients with DME. Aflibercept 
 
2mg administered 4-weekly to Week 16, followed thereafter by 8 weekly dosing was the control arm. 
An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 57. 
Only one eye was assigned as the study eye. If both eyes were considered eligible, the eye with the 
worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as assessed at screening, was selected as the study eye 
unless the investigator deemed the other eye to be more appropriate for treatment in the study.

Treatments 
There were three treatment arms 
o  Arm A 6 mg intravitreal faricimab injections Q4W to Week 20, followed by 6 mg intravitreal 
faricimab injections Q8W to Week 96, followed by the final study visit at Week 100. 
o  Arm B 6 mg intravitreal faricimab injections Q4W to at least Week 12, followed by PTI dosing 
of 6 mg intravitreal faricimab injections to Week 96, followed by the final study visit at Week 
100.  
Patients randomized to the PTI arm (Arm B) were treated with faricimab on a Q4W dosing interval until 
at least the patient’s Week 12 visit, or a later visit when CST met the predefined reference CST 
threshold (CST < 325 µm for Spectralis SD-OCT, or < 315 µm for Cirrus SD-OCT or Topcon SD-OCT), 
as determined by the central reading center (CRC). The reference CST is used at study drug dosing 
visits by the IxRS for the drug dosing interval decision-making. 
After a patient’s initial reference CST was established, their study drug dosing interval was increased 
by 4 weeks to an initial Q8W dosing interval by the IxRS. From this point forward, the study drug 
dosing interval was extended, reduced, or maintained based on assessments made at study drug 
dosing visits. 
Interval extended by 4 weeks: 
• 
If the CST value increased or decreased by ≤ 10% without an associated ≥ 10-letter 
BCVA decrease 
Interval maintained: 
• 
If the CST decreased by > 10% or  
•  CST value increased or decreased by ≤ 10% with an associated ≥ 10-letter BCVA 
decrease or 
•  CST value increased between > 10% and ≤ 20% without an associated ≥ 5-letter BCVA 
decrease 
Interval reduced by 4 weeks: 
• 
If the CST value increased between > 10% and ≤ 20% with an associated ≥ 5- to < 10-letter 
BCVA decrease or 
•  CST value increased by > 20% without an associated ≥ 10-letter BCVA decrease 
Interval reduced by 8 weeks: 
• 
If the CST value increased by > 10% with an associated ≥ 10-letter BCVA decrease. 
Arm C 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept injections Q4W to Week 16, followed by 2 mg intravitreal 
aflibercept injections Q8W to Week 96, followed by the final study visit at Week 100. 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal injections of the 6-mg dose of 
faricimab on BCVA outcomes. 
The key secondary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of faricimab on DR severity outcomes 
Other secondary efficacy objectives included the following: evaluate efficacy of faricimab on additional 
BCVA outcomes; evaluate efficacy of faricimab on additional DR outcomes; evaluate faricimab 
treatment intervals in the PTI arm; evaluate the efficacy of faricimab on anatomical outcome measures 
using SD-OCT; evaluate the efficacy of faricimab on patient-reported vision-related functioning and 
quality of life using the NEI VFQ-25 
For each of the two faricimab arms (Q8W and PTI), the following three hypotheses were tested 
separately against the active comparator (aflibercept Q8W) at an overall significance level of α = 
0.0496 using a graph-based testing procedure (Bretz et al. 2009, Bretz et al. 2011) to control for the 
overall type I error rate: 
 
•  Non-inferiority of faricimab compared with aflibercept Q8W in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population with a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters  
•  Superiority of faricimab compared with aflibercept Q8W in the treatment naive (TN) population 
•  Superiority of faricimab compared with aflibercept Q8W in the ITT population. 
For each faricimab group (Q8W or PTI) the null hypothesis for the non-inferiority comparison: 
H0: µfaricimab-µaflibercept ≤ -4 letters, and the alternative hypothesis: 
Ha: µfaricimab-µaflibercept >-4 letters, will be tested, for which µfaricimab and µaflibercep are the expected change 
from baseline in BCVA averaged over Weeks 48, 52, and 56 for the treatment group in question 
(faricimab Q8W or PTI) and the active comparator (aflibercept Q8W), respectively. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA averaged over Weeks 48, 52, and 
56. The BCVA outcome measure was based on the ETDRS VA chart assessed at a starting distance of 
four meters 
Secondary endpoints 
Key secondary endpoint 
• 
Proportion of patients with a ≥ 2-step DRS improvement from baseline on the ETDRS DRSS at 
Week 52 
Other secondary endpoints 
•  Change from baseline in BCVA (as measured on the ETDRS chart at a starting distance of 4 
meters) over Time 
• 
•

• 
Proportion of patients gaining ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or ≥ 0 letters in BCVA from baseline over time 
and at 1 year 
Proportion of patients with a ≥ 2-step DRS improvement from baseline on the ETDRS DRSS 
over time 
Proportion of patients in the PTI arm on a Q4W, Q8W, Q12W, or Q16W treatment interval at 
Week 52, Week 96, and over time 
Proportion of patients in the PTI arm at Week 52 who achieved a Q12W or Q16W treatment 
interval without an injection interval decrease below Q12W 
•  Change from baseline in CST at 1 year  
•  Change from baseline in NEI VFQ-25 composite score over time and at Week 52 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
After written informed consent had been obtained, all patients received a screening number assigned 
through the IxRS. A patient had to satisfy all eligibility criteria prior to randomization through the IxRS. 
As part of the screening process, the CRC evaluated CFPs and SD-OCT images to provide an objective, 
masked assessment of patient eligibility. After all patient eligibility requirements were confirmed, site 
personnel contacted the IxRS at the Day 1 visit for assignment of a patient identification number (a 
separate number from the screening number). Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, or aflibercept Q8W. After randomization and at each study treatment 
visit (i.e., including Day 1), the IxRS assigned the appropriate study treatment kit to be used. Patients 
were randomized on the same day study treatment was to be initiated (the Day 1 visit). 
Randomization was stratified by the following baseline factors (Day 1): 
o  Baseline BCVA ETDRS letter score (≥ 64 letters vs. < 64 letters) 
o  Prior intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment (yes vs. no) 
o  Region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). 
Patients who were not eligible for enrolment (screen failures) may have been eligible for re-screening 
for up to an additional two times during the enrolment period of the study. 
These are double-masked studies. A minimum of two investigators per site are needed to fulfill the 
masking requirements, and both are required to be present at each scheduled study visit. 
All patients received a sham procedure (the blunt end of an empty syringe was pressed against the 
anaesthetised eye) at the 4-weekly visits at which they did not receive faricimab or aflibercept.  
Sample Size 
A sample size of approximately 300 patients in each arm will provide greater than 90% 
power to show non-inferiority of faricimab to aflibercept (pairwise comparisons between 
the active comparator and each of the faricimab arms) in the ITT population, using a 
non-inferiority margin of 4 letters and under the following assumptions: 
- True mean difference between faricimab and aflibercept of 0 letters 
- Standard deviation (SD) of 11 letters for the change from baseline in BCVA 
averaged over Week 48, Week 52, and Week 56 
- Two-sample t-test 
- 1.25% one-sided type I error rate 
- 10% dropout rate 
Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise noted, analyses of efficacy outcome measures were stratified by baseline BCVA 
ETDRS letter score, as assessed on Day 1 (64 letters or better vs. 63 letters or worse), prior 
intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (yes vs. no), and region (U.S. and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the 
world). The stratification factors as recorded in IxRS were used. The primary comparisons were the 
pairwise comparisons between the active comparator (aflibercept Q8W) and each of the faricimab arms 
(Q8W and PTI). Continuous outcomes were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM). Binary endpoints were analyzed using stratified estimation for binomial proportions. The 
estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for the mean (for continuous variables) or 
proportion (for binary variables) for each of the three treatment arms and for the difference in means 
or proportions between pairwise comparisons of active comparator (aflibercept Q8W) and each of the 
faricimab arms (Q8W and PTI). 
Results 
RHINE 
A total of 1715 patients were screened, and 764 patients failed screening due to not meeting the 
inclusion criteria. The main reasons for screen failure were: not having a BCVA of 73 to 25 letters 
inclusive (20/40 to 20/320) range; having concurrent exclusionary ocular diagnoses such as tractional 
retinal detachment, pre-retinal fibrosis, or epiretinal membrane involving the fovea or disrupting the 
 
 
 
 
macular architecture in the study eye; and failing to meet the criterion for macular thickening 
secondary to DME involving the center of the fovea. 
As specified in the protocol, three randomization stratification factors were used (baseline BCVA ETDRS 
letter score, prior IVT anti-VEGF treatment, and region) to balance these characteristics across the 
treatment arms. Overall, 35 patients were mis-stratified by the incorrect BCVA letter score category 
(63 letters or worse, or 64 letters or better) and 33 patients were mis-stratified by the incorrect prior 
intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy category. Taking both types of mis-stratification 9.8% were mis-
stratified in the faricimab Q8W arm, 6% in the faricimab PTI arm and 5.7% in the aflibercept arm. 
One patient in the aflibercept Q8W arm was randomized but did not receive any treatment. This 
patient did not receive treatment because they were registered in IxRS in error. 
Overall, in the ITT population, 7.6%, 3.4%, and 6.1% of patients discontinued treatment prior to Week 
56 in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The most frequent 
reasons for treatment discontinuation were withdrawal by subject (2.2%, 1.3%, 1.6% in the three 
treatment arms, respectively), lost to follow-up (1.9%, 1.3%, 1.0% in the three treatment arms, 
respectively), and AEs (1.3%, 0.9%, 1.3% in the three treatment arms, respectively. 
YOSEMITE 
A total of 1532 patients were screened, and 592 patients failed screening due to not meeting the 
inclusion criteria. The reasons for screen failure were similar to those for the RHINE study. 
Stratification was similar in both trials, 39 patients were mis-stratified by the incorrect BCVA letter 
score category (63 letters or worse, or 64 letters or better;) and 24 patients were mis-stratified by the 
incorrect prior intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy category. In total 21 (6.7%) were mis-stratified in 
Faricimab Q8W arm, 25 (8%) in the Faricimab PTI arm and 13 (4.2%) in the aflibercept arm. 
Three patients (2 patients in the faricimab Q8W arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept Q8W arm) were 
randomized but did not receive any treatment. The reasons for these patients not receiving treatment 
were withdrawal by subject and a protocol deviation of exclusion criteria (study eye: tractional retinal 
detachment, pre-retinal fibrosis, or epiretinal membrane) for the 2 patients in the faricimab Q8W arm, 
and a protocol deviation of exclusion criteria (any use of medicated intraocular implants within 6 
months of Day 1) for the patient in the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Overall, in the ITT population, 9.9%, 9.6%, and 8.4% of patients discontinued treatment prior to Week 
56 in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The most frequent 
reasons for treatment discontinuation were withdrawal by subject (1.9%, 1.6%, 3.5% in the three 
treatment arms, respectively), death (2.2%, 2.9%, 1.3% in the three treatment arms, respectively) 
and lost to follow-up (2.2%, 2.2%, 1.3% in the three treatment arms, respectively; Table 34). 
Two patients withdrew from treatment for reasons categorized as other; 1 patient in the faricimab PTI 
arm left the country to visit family with no set return date, and for 1 patient in the aflibercept Q8W 
arm it was mutually agreed (between the Sponsor and investigator) that treatment with the current 
standard of care was more appropriate due to the patient’s existing comorbidities

Baseline data 
RHINE 
In the ITT population, baseline demographics were comparable across all treatment arms (Table 35). 
The overall mean age at randomization was 62.2 years (62.5 years in the faricimab Q8W arm, 61.6 
years in the faricimab PTI arm, and 62.3 years in the aflibercept Q8W arm) with the majority of 
patients (57.0%) in the < 65 years of age category. 
The majority (60.9%) of patients were male, white (79.1%), from the ‘Rest of the world countries’ (i.e. 
not USA/Canada or Asia, 56.5%), and of Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (76.1%). 
Baseline demographic characteristics in the TN population were similar to the ITT population and 
generally comparable across arms 
In the ITT population, baseline non-ocular characteristics were comparable across treatment arms. The 
majority of patients had Type 2 diabetes (94.1%) and the mean (SD) HbA1c was 7.7% (1.2), as 
expected based on the inclusion criterion of HbA1c of ≤ 10% within 2 months prior to the Day 1 visit 
date. Baseline non-ocular characteristics in the TN population were similar and comparable across 
treatment arms

Baseline ocular characteristics 
RHINE 
In the ITT population, mean baseline BCVA and mean baseline CST in the study eye was comparable 
across the treatment arms (Table 36). Mean baseline BCVA values were 61.9 letters in the faricimab 
Q8W arm; 62.5 letters in the faricimab PTI arm; and 62.1 letters in the aflibercept Q8W arm. Mean 
baseline CST values were 466.2 µm in the faricimab Q8W arm; 471.3 µm in the faricimab PTI arm; 
and 477.3 µm in the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Patient-reported mean (SD) time since DME diagnosis was 20.0 (34.2) months, while the median (min-
max) was 6.6 months (0-380). The categorical data for diagnosis ≤ 3 months or > 3 months is shown 
in Table 36. The mean (SD) time since last anti-VEGF treatment in previously-treated patients was 
18.7 (19.2) months. Baseline DR status was generally comparable across the treatment arms. The 
majority of patients (approximately 60%) had moderate-to-severe (DRSS 43/47/53) NPDR, followed 
by mild (DRSS < 43) NPDR (approximately 30%), and PDR (DRSS > 53) (approximately 8%). 
As per study design, the majority of patients were naive to anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye 
(79.6%) with a comparable proportion of TN patients across all treatment arms; the remaining 
patients were previously treated with anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because approximately 80% of the ITT population consisted of TN patients, there were expected 
differences between the populations in the time since diagnosis data. Patient reported mean (SD) time 
since DME diagnosis was 15.9 (34.1) months in the TN population, while the median (min-max) was 
3.5 (0-380) months.  
YOSEMITE 
In the ITT population, mean baseline BCVA and mean baseline CST in the study eye were comparable 
across the treatment arms. Mean baseline BCVA values were 62.0 letters in the faricimab Q8W arm; 
61.9 letters in the faricimab PTI arm; and 62.2 letters in the aflibercept Q8W arm. Mean baseline CST 
values were 492.3 µm in the faricimab Q8W arm; 485.8 µm in the faricimab PTI arm; and 484.5 µm in 
the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Patient-reported mean (SD) time since DME diagnosis was 16.4 (29.1) months, while the median (min-
max) was 3.1 months (0-304). The categorical data for time since diagnosis (≤ 3 months or > 3 
months) are shown in Table 36. The mean (SD) time since last anti-VEGF treatment in previously-
treated patients was 18.3 (17.3) months. Baseline DR status was generally comparable across the 
treatment arms. The majority of patients (approximately 60%) had moderate-to-severe (DRSS 
43/47/53) NPDR, followed by mild (DRSS < 43) NPDR (approximately 30%), and PDR (DRSS > 53) 
(approximately 8%). 
As per study design, the majority of patients were naive to anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye 
(77.1%) with a comparable proportion of TN patients across all treatment arms; the remaining 
patients were previously treated with anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye. 
Because approximately 77% of the ITT population consisted of TN patients, there were expected 
differences between the populations in the time since diagnosis data. The mean and median patient-
reported mean (SD) time since DME diagnosis was 9.7 (23.4) months in the TN population, while the 
median (min-max) was 1.6 (0-304) months.

Outcomes and estimation 
Confidence Intervals (CI): 97.5% CI is a rounding of 97.52% CI for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, and 95% CI is a rounding of 95.04% CI for other secondary endpoints. Pooled results are 
presented with 95% CIs. 
RHINE 
In the ITT population, patients treated with faricimab Q8W or PTI had a non-inferior mean change from 
baseline in BCVA at Week 48/52/56 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q8W, as the lower 
bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and 
aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters. At Week 48/52/56 the adjusted mean change from 
baseline in BCVA was 11.8, 10.8 and 10.3 letters in the faricimab Q8W, PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA between the 
faricimab Q8W and PTI dosing arms when compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 
was 1.5 letters (97.5% CI: -0.1, 3.2) and 0.5 letters (97.5% CI:-1.1, 2.1), respectively (Table 37). 
In the TN population, patients treated with faricimab Q8W or PTI did not have a superior mean change 
from baseline in BCVA at Week 48/52/56 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q8W. The 
results of the TN population were similar to the results of the ITT population where the difference in 
adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA between the faricimab Q8W and PTI dosing arms when 
compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 was 1.1 letters (97.5% CI: -0.7, 3.0; p = 
0.1718) and 0.6 letters (97.5% CI:-1.2, 2.4; p = 0.4602), respectively (Table 37).

ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; LOCF = last observation carried 
forward; MMRM = mixed model for repeated measures; PTI = personalized treatment interval (from Q4W up to Q16W); Q8W = every 8 weeks; TN = 
treatment naive. 
Note: ITT population: faricimab Q8W = 315, faricimab PTI = 313, aflibercept = 312; TN population: faricimab Q8W = 238, faricimab PTI = 245, 
aflibercept = 242; PP population: faricimab Q8W = 251, faricimab PTI = 275, aflibercept = 274. 
Note: For the MMRM analysis, the model adjusted for treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline 
BCVA (< 64 letters vs >= 64 letters), region (U.S. and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world), and for the ITT and PP population prior intravitreal 
anti-VEGF therapy (yes vs. no). An unstructured covariance structure was used. The estimate of the difference between the two groups used a 
composite contrast over Weeks 48, 52 and 56. For the primary estimand and LOCF analyses, treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were 
applied to non-COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively. For the treatment policy analysis, observed BCVA 
assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events. For the hypothetical strategy analysis, hypothetical strategy was applied to 
non-COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events. For the MMRM analyses, missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. For the 
LOCF analysis, missing data were implicitly imputed by using the last post-baseline observation carried forward. Invalid BCVA values were excluded 
from analysis. 
Note: For trimmed mean analysis, distribution of the test statistics was estimated by permutation test with 30,000 samples. Patients were considered 
to have the worst outcomes and were trimmed if any of the following occurred: 1.Patient had intercurrent events not related to COVID-19 prior to 
Week 48; 2.Patient had a missing BCVA 
assessment at Week 48 and had intercurrent events not related to COVID-19 at Week 48; 3.Patient had missing BCVA assessments at Weeks 48 and 
52, and had intercurrent events that were not related to COVID-19 in either one of these two visits; 4.Patient had missing BCVA assessments at Weeks 
48, 52 and 56, and had intercurrent events not related to COVID-19 in either one of these three visits. 
Note: For multiple imputation, the analysis is the same as described for ANCOVA below except missing post-baseline BCVA assessments after the 
occurrence of intercurrent events that were not due to COVID-19 were imputed using MI assuming not MAR. BCVA assessments after censoring due to 
COVID-19 related intercurrent events were imputed using MI assuming MAR. Other missing post-baseline BCVA assessments were imputed assuming 
MAR. 
Note: For the ANCOVA analysis, the model used the average of non-missing change from baseline in BCVA at Weeks 48, 52 and 56 as the response 
variables adjusted for the treatment group, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA (< 64 letters vs. >= 64 letters), prior intravitreal anti-VEGF

bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and 
aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters. At Week 48/52/56 the adjusted mean change from 
baseline in BCVA was 10.7, 11.6, and 10.9 letters in the faricimab Q8W, PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA between the 
faricimab Q8W and PTI dosing arms when compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 
was -0.2 letters (97.5% CI: -2.0, 1.6) and 0.7 letters (97.5% CI: -1.1, 2.5), respectively (Table 39). 
In the TN population, patients treated with faricimab Q8W or PTI did not have a superior mean change 
from baseline in BCVA at Week 48/52/56 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q8W. The

The proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRS from baseline as measured on the 
ETDRS DRSS at Week 52 was a key secondary endpoint. In the RHINE study the proportion of patients 
achieving a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRS from baseline as measured on the ETDRS DRSS at Week 52 
was 44.2%, 43.7%, and 46.8% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI and aflibercept arms respectively 
In the ITT population, the pre-specified DRSS non-inferiority (margin of 10%) was not met as the 
lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in the adjusted proportion between the 
faricimab and aflibercept arms was below -10% for both the faricimab Q8W and PTI arms at Week 52: 
-2.6% (97.5% CI: -12.6%, 7.4%) and -3.5% (97.5% CI: -13.4%, 6.3%), respectively (Table 41). 
In the TN population, the difference in the adjusted proportion of patients who had a ≥ 2-step

In the YOSEMITE study the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 2-step improvement in DRS from 
baseline as measured on the ETDRS DRSS at Week 52 was 46.0%, 42.5%, and 35.8% in the faricimab

In the ITT population, the pre-specified DRSS non-inferiority (margin of 10%) was met as the lower 
bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in the adjusted proportion between the 
faricimab and aflibercept arms was above  -10% for both the faricimab Q8W and PTI arms at Week 52: 
10.2% (97.5% CI: 0.3%, 20.0%) and 6.1% (97.5% CI: -3.6%, 15.8%), respectively (Table 42). 
In the TN population, superiority was not met. The results of the TN population were similar to the

Note: The sample size for each analysis is based on the intercurrent event handling.  
Note: CMH weighted % for aflibercept arm presented for faricimab Q8W vs. aflibercept comparison, however the corresponding CMH weighted % for 
for faricimab PTI vs. aflibercept comparison is similar to the one shown above; the weighted estimate is based on CMH test stratified by baseline BCVA 
score (< 64 letters vs. >= 64 letters), region (U.S. and Canada vs. the rest of the world), and for ITT and PP population prior intravitreal anti-VEGF 
therapy (yes vs. no). Asia and rest of the world regions are combined due to a small number of enrolled patients. For the primary estimand, treatment 
policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were applied to non-COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the ITT population in the RHINE study at Week 48/52/56, 33.8%, 28.5%, and 30.3% of patients 
gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and 
aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively (Table 43a). The difference in the adjusted proportion of patients 
who gained at least 15 letters from baseline between the faricimab Q8W and faricimab PTI arms when 
compared with the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 was 3.5% and -2.0%, respectively. 
Comparable results were also seen across all three treatment arms for patients gaining ≥10, ≥5, or ≥0 
letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 48/52/56 
In the ITT population in the YOSEMITE study at Week 48/52/56, 29.2%, 35.5%, and 31.8% of patients 
gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and

In the RHINE study at Week 52, 13.3%, 15.6%, 20.1%, and 51.0% of patients in the PTI arm were on 
a Q4W, Q8W, Q12W or Q16W treatment interval, respectively. The proportion of patients achieving a 
faricimab dosing interval of Q12W or Q16W and maintaining it without an injection interval decrease 
below Q12W through Week 52 was 64.3%.  
In the YOSEMITE study at Week 52, 10.8%, 15.4%, 21.0% and 52.8% of patients in the PTI arm were 
on a Q4W, Q8W, Q12W or Q16W treatment interval, respectively. The proportion of patients achieving 
a faricimab dosing interval of Q12W or Q16W and maintaining it without an injection interval decrease 
below Q12W through Week 52 was 67.8%. 
In the RHINE study in the ITT population patients treated with faricimab Q8W or PTI had numerically 
greater reductions in CST from baseline at Week 48/52/56 compared with patients treated with 
aflibercept Q8W. At Week 48/52/56 the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -195.8 µm, -
187.6 µm, and -170.1 µm in the faricimab Q8W, PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The 
difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in CST between the faricimab Q8W and PTI dosing 
arms when compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 was -25.7 µm and -17.6 µm 
respectively 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the YOSEMITE study in the ITT population patients treated with faricimab Q8W or PTI also had 
numerically greater reductions in CST from baseline at Week 48/52/56 compared with patients treated 
with aflibercept Q8W. At Week 48/52/56, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -206.6 
µm, -196.5 µm, and -170.3 µm in the faricimab Q8W, PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. 
The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in CST between the faricimab Q8W and PTI 
dosing arms when compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm at Week 48/52/56 was -36.2 µm and -26.2

Units: microns. BCVA = Best-corrected Visual Acuity; CRC = Central Reading Center; CST = Central Subfield Thickness; ILM = Internal 
Limiting Membrane; MMRM = Mixed-Model Repeated- Measures; PTI = Personalized Treatment Interval (from Q4W up to Q16W). For the 
MMRM analysis, the model adjusted for treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline CST (continuous), baseline 
BCVA score (< 64 letters vs. >= 64 letters), prior Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (yes vs. no), and region (U.S. and Canada, Asia, and the 
rest of the world). An unstructured covariance structure is used. The estimate of the difference between the two groups is using a 
composite contrast over Weeks48, 52 and 56. Treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were applied to non-COVID-19 related 
and COVID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. 95% CI is a rounding of 95.04% 
CI. CST is defined as the distance between ILM and Bruch's membrane (BM) as assessed by CRC. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following subgroups were analyzed with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint and key 
secondary endpoint using the same method as specified above for each respective endpoint. Forest 
plots were created to summarize the results. The subgroup categories defined in the SAP were 
combined when there was not enough representation of a specific subpopulation.

BCVA = best corrected visual acuity;  MMRM = Mixed-Model Repeated- Measures. For the MMRM analysis, the model adjusted for treatment 
group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline CST (continuous), baseline BCVA score (< 64 letters vs. >= 64 letters), prior 
Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (yes vs. no), and region (U.S. and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). The stratification factor is excluded if 
it is the subgroup. An unstructured covariance structure is used. The estimate of the difference between the two groups uses a composite 
contrast over Weeks 48, 52 and 56. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. Invalid BCVA values were excluded from analysis. 95% CI is 
a rounding of 95.04% CI. 
Long-term data to Week 100 YOSEMITE and RHINE studies 
The global enrolment cohorts completed Week 100 of the DME Phase III studies (YOSEMITE and 
RHINE) on September and August 2021, respectively, with the last patient rolling over to the extension 
study RHONE-X on 15 September 2021. The efficacy and safety of the PTI dosing regimen was 
assessed for both studies for the entire 2-year study period up to Week 100. 
• 
In both YOSEMITE and RHINE, the mean change from baseline in BCVA averaged over Weeks 
92, 96, and 100 (Week 92/96/100) was comparable across the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and aflibercept Q8W arms (Figure 58 and Figure 59, respectively). At Week 92/96/100 the 
adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 10.7, 10.7, and 11.4 letters in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms in YOSEMITE and 10.9, 10.1, and 
9.4 letters, respectively, in RHINE. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in 
BCVA between the faricimab Q8W and PTI dosing arms when compared to the aflibercept 
Q8W arm at Week 92/96/100 was -0.7 letters (95% CI: -2.6, 1.2) and -0.7 letters (95% CI: -
2.5, 1.2), respectively, in YOSEMITE, and 1.5 letters (95% CI: -0.5, 3.6) and 0.7 letters (95% 
CI: -1.3, 2.7), respectively, in RHINE. The final BCVA efficacy results (Week 92/96/100) are 
consistent with the efficacy results at the time point of the primary analysis (averaged over 
Weeks 48, 52, and 56)

•  During the 2-year period of YOSEMITE and RHINE, patients in the PTI dosing arm were able 
to follow an individualized dosing regimen based on a treat-and-extend concept, which 
allowed dosing interval extension, maintenance or reduction based on the CST and BCVA 
 
 
 
change at study dosing visits after completion of the initial four Q4W doses. Therefore, during 
a 2-year period of the studies, patients could have up to a maximum of four full Q16W dosing 
cycles and up to a maximum of six full cycles of Q12W dosing (study schematic below, Figure 
59). 
• 
• 
The proportions of patients in the PTI arm on a Q4W, Q8W, Q12W, or Q16W treatment 
interval at Week 96 (last study visit where a treatment decision was made) were 7.0%, 
14.8%, 18.1%, 60.0% in YOSEMITE, and 10.1%, 11.8%, 13.6%, 64.5% in RHINE (Table 3). 
Therefore, at Week 96, the total of patients in the faricimab PTI arm who achieved a Q16W or 
Q12W dosing interval was 78% in each of the two studies (60% on Q16W + 18.1% on Q12W 
in YOSEMITE and 64.5% on Q16W + 13.6% on Q12W in RHINE; Table 48). 
Table 48.

• 
Through Week 96, the proportion of patients in the faricimab PTI arm who achieved a Q12W 
or Q16W treatment interval without an injection interval decrease below Q12W was 60.4% in 
YOSEMITE and 63.1% in RHINE. 
The proportion of patients at Week 96 who achieved a Q16W treatment interval without an 
injection interval decrease below Q16W was 52.6% in YOSEMITE and 58.2% in RHINE.  
Among patients who were on a Q12W or Q16W interval at Week 52, the proportion of patients 
who remained on Q12W or Q16W dosing without an interval decrease below Q12W through 
Week 96 was 75.0% in YOSEMITE and 83.5% in RHINE  
Among patients who were on a Q16W interval at Week 52, the proportion of patients who 
remained on Q16W dosing without an interval decrease below Q16W through Week 96 was 
69.9% in YOSEMITE and 81.8% in RHINE. 
The maintenance of vision gains achieved at Year 1 through Year 2 across all three treatment 
arms was supported by anatomical results as measured on SD-OCT. The benefit of faricimab 
Q8W and faricimab PTI treatment as compared to aflibercept Q8W was observed on the 
endpoints of CST change from baseline over time, proportions of patients with absence of 
DME over time, and proportions of patients with absence of IRF over time  
Additionally, the proportions of patients with a ≥2-step DRS improvement across both 
faricimab treatment arms in the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies at Week 52 (46.0% and 44.2% 
in faricimab Q8W arms, 42.5% and 43.7% faricimab PTI arms, respectively) were maintained 
 
 
at Week 96 (51.4% and 53.5% in faricimab Q8W arms, 42.8% and 44.3% faricimab PTI 
arms, respectively); The 11 percentage point difference between the aflibercept arms of 
YOSEMITE and RHINE studies in the proportions of patients with ≥2-step DRS improvement 
at Week 52 (35.8% in YOSEMITE versus 46.8% in RHINE; was no longer apparent at Week 
96. At Week 96, aflibercept-treated patients in both studies achieved comparable ≥ 2-step 
DRSS improvements (42.2% in YOSEMITE and 43.8% in RHINE;  
• 
In summary, the BCVA gains achieved by patients on PTI dosing at Year 1, which were non-
inferior compared to standard of care aflibercept Q8W dosing, were maintained along with the 
anatomical benefits over time up to Year 2. Through Week 100, patients in the PTI arm were 
able to complete up to a maximum of four Q16W cycles or up to six Q12W cycles in the Phase 
III DME program. At Week 96, there were 78% of patients in the faricimab PTI arm who 
achieved a Q16W or Q12W dosing interval in each study. 
Among the patients on a Q16W interval at Week 52, 70% or more maintained Q16W dosing without an 
interval decrease through Week 96 reproducibly in both studies.

2.4.5.2.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The Applicant provided pooled analyses of data across the two pivotal Phase III studies Yosemite and 
Rhine. Due to the identical design of the two studies and the comparable baseline characteristics of the 
recruited population, this is considered acceptable. The analyses were in line with the results achieved 
in the individual studies. Differences in efficacy results across the Phase III studies were already 
discussed in the results section above. 
The key secondary EP “Proportion of patients with ≥ 2-step DRS improvement from baseline at week 
52”, which was met in Yosemite but not met in Rhine, revealed comparable results across the three 
treatment arms in the pooled analysis. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of studies to support both indications (neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration and diabetic macular oedema. 
A number of GCP irregularities were reported in the studies which led to a triggered GCP inspection at 
the request of the CHMP.    
The Sponsor identified two breaches of GCP in the Phase III studies: 1) potential unmasking of 2 
patients due to an internal software, and 2) unconsented optional plasma samples or optional aqueous 
humor samples were collected from a total of 235 patients across all 4 phase III studies. 
A GCP inspection was conducted remotely at the sponsor (Roche/Genentech) site in the USA, all 
participants, including the inspectors conducted the inspection using video conferencing; and at one 
investigational site in Slovakia. The site inspection was conducted on site. At the inspection of the 
sponsor site Genentech/Roche there were 1 critical, 15 major and 8 minor findings. At the inspection of 
the investigator site in Slovakia there were 0 critical, 5 major and 8 minor findings. The inspectors 
recommended acceptance of all data of all four inspected trials for the assessment of the Vabysmo 
MAA.  
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration indication (nAMD) 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of this indication the Applicant submitted two phase II studies which can be considered as 
dose-finding studies and two ongoing duplicate phase III studies that can be considered pivotal. All 
four studies were in treatment naïve nAMD populations.  
All studies were randomised active controlled double-blind trials. The randomisation of the phase III 
studies was stratified according to BCVA (≥ 74 letters, 73-55 letters, and ≤ 54 letters); low luminance 
deficit (< 33 letters, and ≥ 33 letters) and region (North America, Asia and rest of the world). Both 
studies had patients mis-stratified in the BCVA and low luminance strata. 
The active comparator in the phase II trials was ranizibumab 0.5mg IVT, whilst the comparator in the 
phase III trials is aflibercept 2mg IVT. The Applicant justified the change to use of aflibercept as an 
active control in the phase III trials on the basis that the product is a globally approved anti-VEGF 
treatment for nAMD with an eight weekly maintenance regimen. It is noted that aflibercept has been 
 
 
 
accepted as the active control arm in the MA for brolucizumab (Beovu). The study design allowed for 
three different treatment intervals (8 weekly, 12 weekly or 16 weekly) for faricimab dependent on 
disease stability at weeks 20 and 24 following four weekly dosing up to and including week 12. From 
week 60 patients in the faricimab arm will be treated on a personal treatment interval (PTI) schedule. 
Study drug dosing intervals in the PTI regimen will be determined by calculations made automatically 
by the IxRS based on an algorithm that includes data on change in CST, change in BCVA, and presence 
of new macular hemorrhage. 
The treatment regimen for aflibercept was fixed after an initial treatment phase with 3 monthly 
injections up to week 8, with following injections every 2 months. No personalised treatment was 
allowed, even though the EU Summary of Product Characteristic would allow longer treatment intervals 
of up to 16 weeks, this regimen was not approved in other countries participating in these global trials. 
The total number of injections was thus maintained in the control groups regardless of the disease 
activity of the patients, contrary to the faricimab groups. Although a reduced need for injections while 
maintaining visual acuity would pose a significant benefit, due to the fixed comparator regimen, the 
clinical development does not allow to demonstrate strong conclusion on the reduction of the 
treatment burden of faricimab 6 mg compared to a standard of care. 
Both phase III studies and the STAIRWAY phase II study were non-inferiority studies with a non-
inferiority margin of – 4 letters. This is considered acceptable from both a statistical and clinical point 
of view. 
Regarding the study population only treatment naïve patients were recruited. The Applicant has 
justified the non-inclusion of treatment experienced patients on the basis of challenges in determining 
an appropriate non-inferiority margin for change in visual function in a mixed treatment naive and pre-
treated population given that pre-treated patients have a lower capacity to benefit from treatment than 
treatment naïve patients (supported by data from the literature). In addition, the registration studies 
for ranibizumab, aflibercept and brolucizumab only included treatment naïve patients. The non-
inferiority margin of the Phase III faricimab studies for nAMD is based on data from the MARINA and 
ANCHOR ranibizumab pivotal nAMD studies and is also supported by data from the VIEW1 and VIEW2 
aflibercept pivotal nAMD studies, all of which included only treatment naive patients.  
The Applicant has also presented data on the maintenance of visual function following a switch in anti-
VEGF therapy. In the phase II Avenue study, patients maintained visual gains after switching from 
ranibizumab to faricimab. Although this study included only a limited number of patients and had a 
shorter study duration, results support the maintenance of a treatment effect in previously treated 
patients. Real world data from other anti-VEGF therapies also indicate that vision can be maintained 
after a therapy switch. The responses are considered acceptable and it is not proposed to restrict the 
indication to treatment naïve patients. 
The inclusion criterion threshold for the focal lesion size of ≤ 9 disc areas (DA) on FFA was considered 
likely to exclude a more advanced nAMD population. The VIEW study for aflibercept included patients 
with a DA of ≤ 12 disc areas. This raised questions regarding the generalisability of the results to a 
more advanced population. In their response the applicant justified the exclusion of patients with 
larger lesion sizes i.e. > 9 and < 12 disc areas on the basis that nowadays treatment is initiated earlier 
because of better outcomes and consequently lesion sizes are not as large as those treated in earlier 
registration studies e.g. ranibizumab and aflibercept. Consequently, the proportion of study subjects 
with a lesion size between 9 and 12 disc areas is likely to be small. The average CNV lesion size in the 
HAWK study brolucizumab is similar to the lesion size in the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies, whilst the 
lesion size in the HARRIER study is smaller. The Applicant’s argumentation is accepted. In addition, 
 
only unilateral treatment was allowed in the phase III studies. With regard to establishing efficacy and 
safety profiles of faricimab, this strategy was considered acceptable.  
During previous advice, the Applicant was further recommended to select the study eye at random. 
According to the protocol synopsis if both eyes were considered eligible, the eye with the worse BCVA, 
as assessed at screening, was selected as the study eye.  
For all four studies, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA (as measured on the 
ETDRS chart at a starting distance of 4 meters). For the AVENUE phase II study this was evaluated at 
20 weeks and at Week 40 for the phase II STAIRWAY study. For the phase III studies the primary 
endpoint was evaluated by averaging the change from baseline over Weeks 40, 44 and 48. There were 
a number of other supportive visual endpoints including: a responder analysis for gain in ≥ 15, ≥10, ≥ 
5 letters BCVA from baseline as well as a responder analysis for avoidance of a loss of letters; change 
from baseline BCVA over time. Anatomical secondary endpoints included change from baseline in 
central subfield thickness (CST), absence of sub-retinal and intra-retinal fluid and change in lesion size. 
Descriptive data was provided on frequency of faricimab administration. Change from baseline in NEI 
VFQ-25 composite score over time was an exploratory endpoint. The primary and supporting 
secondary endpoints in particular those related to vision are considered appropriate given that the 
objective of treatment is to improve vision and/or prevent any further deterioration. Change in CST is 
an accepted biomarker. 
The primary endpoint was evaluated in the ITT population in both pivotal studies using an MMRM 
model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in the ITT population using last observation carried 
forward. Supplementary analyses included a per-protocol analysis; a treatment policy strategy analysis 
for all intercurrent events and a hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events. All were conducted 
using an MMRM model and all except the per protocol analysis were conducted in the ITT population. 
Both phase III studies are conducted in tandem and have both been affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic, with some patients being unable to attend treatment visits including those at weeks 40, 44 
and 48. Prior to finalisation, the analysis plan was updated to address intercurrent events due to 
COVID-19. Uncertainties with respect to conclusions about the treatment schedule remain, as there 
likely have been substantial deviations from the prescribed dosing schedule (across all arms) due to 
the pandemic situation. In TENAYA 27 patients [8.1%] and 31 patients [9.2%], and in LUCERNE 25 
patients [7.6%] and 21 patients [6.4%] in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively, missed an 
active dose due to COVID-19. With regard to these intercurrent events, the Applicant has provided 
additional analysis on how many patients in each of the different treatment intervals were affected and 
when the actual dose was received and discussed any potential impact on efficacy analysis. These 
intercurrent events are not believed to have impacted on treatment outcomes. 
In conclusion, the design of the studies is considered adequate.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both pivotal studies showed an improvement from baseline in BCVA averaged over weeks 40, 44 and 
48. The adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 40/44/48 in the TENAYA study was 5.8 
and 5.1 letters in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted mean 
change from baseline in BCVA at week 40/44/48 between the faricimab arm and aflibercept arm was 
0.7 letters (95% CI: - 1.1, 2.5). The adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 6.6 letters in 
both the faricimab and aflibercept arms of the LUCERNE study with the difference in adjusted mean 
change from baseline between the faricimab arm and aflibercept arm of 0.0 letters (95% CI - 1.7, 
1.8). In both studies, the lower bound of the 95% CI were above -2 and clearly above the non-
inferiority margin of -4. A sensitivity analysis using LOCF and supplementary analyses including per 
 
protocol, a treatment policy strategy analysis for all intercurrent events and a hypothetical strategy for 
all intercurrent events all produced similar results. Similar results between treatment arms in both 
studies for the responder analysis of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters from baseline BCVA (TENAYA: 
faricimab 20%, aflibercept 15.7%; LUCERNE faricimab 20.2%, aflibercept 22.2%) and reduction from 
baseline in CST of the order of 130µm are all supportive of non-inferiority.  The results are considered 
clinically relevant. 
The Applicant has provided further data to address the potential impact of intercurrent events due to 
COVID-19. Overall, it is not considered that these events have impacted the overall study outcomes.  
During the initial assessment, there were uncertainties regarding the durability of effect particularly in 
the longer faricimab treatment intervals, which were resolved following provision of week 52/56/60 
data. Patients randomised to faricimab could have been assigned from the Week 20/24 treatment visits 
to one of three treatment intervals (dependent on specific criteria relating to CST and BCVA), namely 
an 8, 12 or 16 week interval. The study design did not allow for modification of the faricimab dose in 
the case of an inadequate response. The period of follow up from Week 20/24 to Week 48 was 
considered to be inadequate to make any judgement on durability of response particularly in those 
treated at a 16 week interval. However further data confirmed that BCVA gains at 12 weeks in those 
treated with faricimab 6mg Q16W were preserved when averaged over Weeks 52/56/60. 
The proportions of faricimab-treated patients on a fixed Q8W, Q12W, or Q16W treatment interval at 
Week 48 were 20.3%, 34.0%, and 45.7% in TENAYA and 22.2%, 32.9%, and 44.9% in LUCERNE. The 
Applicant provided efficacy results for the individual treatment intervals (Q8W, Q12W and Q16W, 
respectively) which showed that in the TENAYA study change from baseline BCVA averaged over weeks 
52, 56 and 60 was greater for those treated with faricimab 6mg at Q16W intervals compared to 
faricimab at Q8W, Q12W or aflibercept at Q8W intervals. This difference was less marked in the 
LUCERNE study. 
Efficacy assessments at week 60 included three cycles of Q16W and four cycles of Q12W and results 
were provided as average from weeks 52, 56 and 60. The difference in change in BCVA at week 
52/56/60 was 0.7 (95% CI: -1.2, 2.7) in TENAYA and -0.6 (95% CI: -2.4, 1.3) in LUCERNE. In the 
pooled ITT population, the difference between treatment arms was 0.1 (95% CI: -1.2, 1.4) at Week 
52/56/60. Also week 60 data for secondary endpoints are comparable between faricimab and 
aflibercept. In the pooled ITT population, 20.9% and 20.2% of patients in the faricimab and aflibercept 
arms, respectively, gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 52/56/60 with a difference 
of 0.7% (95% CI: -3.6%, 5.1%) between the treatment arms. Overall, additional data up to week 60 
support the results observed for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints seen at earlier timepoints. 
Regarding section 4.2 of the SmPC the amended posology proposed by the Applicant is in the main 
accepted  
Diabetic macular oedema indication 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant submitted one Phase II (BOULEVARD) that could be considered dose finding and two 
phase III (RHINE and YOSEMITE) studies that can be considered pivotal in support of this indication. 
The phase III studies are duplicate studies. 
All studies were randomised active controlled double-blind trials. The phase III studies were stratified 
by baseline BCVA ETDRS score (≥ 64 letters v < 64 letters), prior intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment and 
 
 
region (North America, Asia and rest of the world). A number of patients in each of the phase III 
studies were mis-stratified. 
The BOULEVARD study was a superiority study. Overall, the design of the study is considered 
acceptable. Regarding the selected dose of the comparator (0.3 mg ranibizumab), there is a 
discrepancy with what is approved in the European Union and this is regarded suboptimal. In the 
European Union, the approved dose of Ranibizumab is 0.5 mg. However, the selection of the 0.3 mg 
dose might rely on the fact that the study was only conducted in the US, where Ranibizumab is 
approved for the 0.3 mg dose. In the EPAR of Ranibizumab, it is stated that no statistically significant 
differences between the 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg doses are obtained. However, due to the consistency of 
the trends and an increased benefit from the higher dose across all the pivotal trials, the higher dose 
was approved. Thus, it would have been preferred that the Applicant would have chosen the approved 
0.5 mg dose over the non-approved 0.3 mg dose for the comparator. However, in light of the fact that 
the results of this study are only regarded as supportive, the selection of the lower dose for the active 
comparator Ranibizumab is accepted. 
The RHINE and YOSEMITE studies are non-inferiority studies with a non-inferiority margin of - 4 letters 
on the BCVA EDTRS chart. Superiority of faricimab compared to aflibercept was also planned to be 
tested in the treatment naïve population and then in the ITT population. The chosen non-inferiority 
margin is considered acceptable from a clinical and a statistical point of view.  
All studies included patients with diabetic macular oedema who were either treatment naïve or had 
previously been treated with IVT anti-VEGF products. Pre-treated patients were capped at 25% of the 
total study population in the phase III studies. Patients with HbA1C > 10% were excluded from the 
study unlike the VIVID and VISTA studies which included diabetic patients with HbA1C ≤ 12%. 
For the phase II study, which was conducted in the US, the active control arm was ranibizumab 0.3mg 
in line with the approved FDA posology for diabetic macular oedema but lower than the 0.5mg 
posology authorised in the EU. The control arm for the phase III studies was aflibercept 2mg 
administered 4 weekly until week 16 and then 8-weekly. This is in line with the EU approved posology 
for diabetic macular oedema of one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one 
injection every two months in the first year of treatment. Similar or better efficacy versus ranibizumab 
up to 1 year in diabetic macular oedema has been shown in a systematic review (Virgili 2018). Two 
dose schedules of faricimab 6mg an eight weekly and a personal treatment interval (PTI) schedule 
were compared to aflibercept. Those in the faricimab Q8W arm received a Q4W dose up to Week 20 
and those in the PTI arm received a Q4W dose up to at least Week 12.  
In the PTI arm, the dosing interval could be maintained or increased by 4 weeks/ decreased by 4 or 8 
weeks increments, based on the relative change of the CST and BCVA compared with reference CST 
and reference BCVA. It seems as if this algorithm was based on the anatomical outcome rather than on 
the BCVA, as e.g. the interval was reduced if the CST increased by 20% compared to the reference 
CST (independent of BCVA change). However, the interval was only maintained and not reduced if the 
patients lost more than 10 letters on the BCVA compared to reference BCVA and the CST increased by 
less than 10%. The Applicant was asked to explain the rationale of this algorithm in detail as it was 
questioned how far an improvement in an anatomical outcome with a concomitant decrease in the 
BCVA score could have justified the maintenance of the treatment interval. In their response, the 
Applicant explained the algorithm on which the treatment interval extension/maintenance/reduction 
was based in detail. The Applicant justified the focus on CST measurement rather than BCVA on the 
basis that this was an objective measure and unlike BCVA unlikely to be affected by other factors 
unrelated to DME. Given the study results of RHINE and YOSEMITE (similar gains in BCVA across study 
groups, similar proportion of patients avoiding a loss of letters in BCVA across the groups) it is agreed 
that the algorithm, although mainly based on changes in CST, seems to have been appropriate for 
treatment interval adjustment during the clinical trials. 
The Applicant chose a fixed dose regimen for the comparator arm. This is in line with the posology of 
aflibercept in the DME indication which states that treatment should be initiated with one injection per 
month for five consecutive doses, followed by one injection every two months. Nonetheless, the 
aflibercept SmPC also states that after the first 12 months of treatment with aflibercept, and based on 
visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be extended, such as with a treat-and-
extend dose regimen, where the treatment intervals are gradually increased to maintain stable visual 
and/or anatomic outcomes. A T&E regimen for the comparator at year 2 in one of the two pivotal trials 
would have been preferable for a better evaluation of the conclusions drawn from the T&E dose 
regimen of the faricimab PTI arm, especially in terms of number of required injections. However, at the 
time of the initiation of the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies, the Q8W interval for aflibercept was 
regarded as the most efficacious regimen and the T&E regimen for aflibercept was only approved after 
initiation of the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies.  
The primary endpoint for the phase III studies was the change from baseline in BCVA averaged over 
Weeks 48, 52, and 56. The BCVA outcome measure was based on the ETDRS VA chart assessed at a 
starting distance of four meters. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 
2-step DRS improvement from baseline on the ETDRS DRSS at Week 52. There were a number of 
other secondary endpoints related to visual acuity and DRS changes as well as changes in the CST and 
absence or intra-retinal fluid.  
The choice of endpoints is considered to be relevant to the indication. However, the timepoint for the 
evaluation of the primary endpoint (the change from baseline in BCVA averaged over weeks 48, 52, 
and 56) was considered too early. With regard to the faricimab PTI arm, patients received initially 4 
monthly injections and then their dosing intervals could be increased based on BCVA/OCT assessment. 
This happened with 4 week increments. Therefore, with the primary analysis based on the week 
48/52/56 assessment, only two injections of the week 16 interval and three injections of the week 12 
interval were covered. This was not regarded as optimal for properly informing the posology of the 
product. Thus, a later time point for the primary analysis would have been preferred. This has also 
been discussed in a Scientific Advice procedure (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/784935/2017). At that time, the 
Applicant proposed a fixed 8-week and 12-week interval for faricimab. It was stated by the CHMP that 
the primary evaluation conducted at week 52 would be insufficient in order to conclude on the 
adequacy of the Q12W regimen (with three Q12W administrations at that time point). In such a 
scenario, the data generated during the second year are of outmost importance. These data have been 
provided with the responses to questions.  
In addition there were concerns with regard to the averaging of the results across three time points 
(weeks 48, 52 and 56). In conjunction with the three different treatment schemes having different 
number of initial doses (faricimab 6 mg Q8W: 6 initial monthly doses, faricimab 6 mg PTI: 4 initial 
monthly doses and aflibercept 2 mg Q8W: 5 initial monthly doses), this could have introduced bias. 
Patients in the aflibercept 2 mg Q8W received doses at week 40, 48 and 56 thus only the week 52 
timepoint of the primary endpoint analysis had a temporal distance of 4 weeks to the last injection. On 
the other hand, patients in the faricimab 6 mg Q8W received doses at week 44 and 52. Thus, there 
was the week 48 and week 56 timepoint of the primary endpoint analysis that had a temporal distance 
of 4 weeks to the last injection. This could have been a disadvantage for the Aflibercept 2 mg Q8W 
arm and was not regarded conservative in a non-inferiority design.  The provided additional analyses 
including a variety of different endpoints with respect to timing of the endpoint assessment. The 
efficacy results were considered robust despite the different dosing schedules between faricimab Q8W 
and aflibercept Q8W arms. This applies to both pivotal studies (i.e., YOSEMITE and RHINE). 
The primary endpoint was evaluated in the ITT population in both pivotal studies using an MMRM 
model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in the ITT population using last observation carried 
forward. Supplementary analyses included a per protocol analysis; a treatment policy strategy analysis 
for all intercurrent events and a hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events. All were conducted 
using an MMRM model and all except the per protocol analysis were conducted in the ITT population. 
Both phase III studies are conducted in tandem and have both been affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic, with some patients being unable to attend treatment visits including those at weeks 44, 48 
and 52 (DME). Prior to finalisation, the statistical analysis plan was updated to address intercurrent 
events due to COVID-19.  
In the protocol of the Phase III studies, the Applicant defined that if both eyes were considered eligible 
for the study, the eye with the worse best-corrected visual acuity, as assessed at screening, was 
selected as the study eye unless the investigator deemed the other eye to be more appropriate for 
treatment in the study. In a Scientific Advice procedure (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/784935/2017) concerning 
the design of the pivotal Phase III studies, the Applicant was recommended to select the study eye at 
random, if both study eyes would have been eligible. This advice was not followed. According to the 
baseline ocular characteristics, the bilateral eligibility concerned 84 patients in the Yosemite trial and in 
53 of these patients, the eye with the worse BCVA was selected. In Rhine, the bilateral eligibility 
concerned 94 patients and in 60 of these patients, the eye with the worse BCVA was selected. In their 
response to question, the Applicant justified that the process of selecting the worse eye (based on 
BCVA) if both eyes were eligible for study treatment, was due to ethical considerations. Testing an 
investigational drug administered via intravitreal injection on the better seeing eye would not have 
been ethical. It is also agreed that due to the low number of patients that were affected (in about 10% 
of the patients both eyes were eligible) and the randomization process that was in place (leading to 
balanced baseline characteristics among groups), an impact on study results was not expected. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both pivotal studies demonstrated non-inferiority of both faricimab treatment schedules to aflibercept 
in the ITT and treatment naïve populations for change from baseline in BCVA averaged over weeks 48, 
52 and 56. Superiority to aflibercept was not shown in the treatment naïve population.  
The adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48/52/56 in the RHINE study was 11.8 
letters in the faricimab Q8W population, 10.8 letters in the faricimab PTI population and 10.3 in the 
aflibercept population. The difference in adjusted means for the faricimab Q8W dose was 1.5 letters 
(97.5% CI -0.1, 3.2) and for the PTI dose 0.5 letters (97.5%CI -1.1, 2.1) when compared with the 
aflibercept Q8W.  Similar results were seen in the treatment naïve population. In the YOSEMITE study 
in the ITT population the adjusted mean change from baseline at week 48/52/56 was 10.7 letters for 
faricimab Q8W, 11.6 for faricimab PTI and 10.9 for aflibercept. The difference in adjusted means for 
the faricimab Q8W dose was -0.2 letters (97.5% CI -2.0, 1.6) and for the PTI dose 0.7 letters 
(97.5%CI -1.1, 2.5) when compared with the aflibercept Q8W. Broadly similar results were seen in the 
treatment naïve population. In both studies, the lower bound of the 97.5% CI were well above -4 in 
the treatment naïve and ITT populations. A sensitivity analysis using LOCF and supplementary 
analyses including per protocol, a treatment policy strategy analysis for all intercurrent events and a 
hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events all produced similar results for both studies. 
In response to a question, the Applicant provided the requested year 2 data for the pivotal RHINE and 
YOSEMITE studies. Mean change from baseline in BCVA was comparable across the faricimab Q8W, 
 
 
faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q8W groups throughout year 2, both in YOSEMITE and in RHINE and 
BCVA efficacy data at week 92/96/100 were similar to the BCVA efficacy data at week 48/52/56, 
showing maintenance of the effect beyond year 1. 
For the primary analysis, missing data were not imputed. This is acceptable - for inferences based on 
an MMRM model - assuming that data were missing at random. However, to a large degree, sensitivity 
and supplementary analyses also require the assumption that a large proportion of data (e.g. for 
COVID-19 related reasons) are missing at random. Consequently, additional analyses evaluating the 
robustness of results with respect to deviations from the MAR assumptions were requested. Tipping 
point analyses were conducted and the results were considered to be sufficiently robust to support the 
conclusions on the primary endpoint. 
While there is little concern that the results of studies YOSEMITE and RHINE support a non-inferiority 
conclusion with respect to the applied dosing schemes (on average) on BCVA, there remain 
uncertainties as to what degree the presented results may support conclusions of non-inferior efficacy 
within subgroups of an individualized treatment schedule with faricimab (i.e. the concern may be that 
undertreatment with the longest treatment interval is compounded by overtreatment with the shortest 
interval). This appears especially relevant as a substantial proportion of subjects (~7% through Week 
56 and ~4% through Week 96, always on Q4W dosing regimen) in the individualized treatment arm 
have been dosed more often (see above) compared to a fixed Q8W treatment schedule with unclear 
implications on efficacy and safety (see also corresponding concern on safety below). In addition, there 
remain uncertainties with regard to adherence to the fixed dosing schemes of faricimab and aflibercept 
for the treatment of DME, as there likely have been substantial deviations from the prescribed dosing 
schedule due to the pandemic situation. Several additional analyses were presented by the Applicant in 
response to questions raised during the assessment with respect to adherence to and impact of the 
prescribed treatment intervals on efficacy. These additional analyses did not raise any concerns with 
regard to the conclusions on non-inferiority. 
Secondary endpoint results were generally supportive of the primary endpoint. In the RHINE study, a 
slightly higher proportion of those in the aflibercept arm achieved a ≥ 2-step improvement than those 
in the faricimab arms in DRS and non-inferiority was not demonstrated compared to aflibercept 
whereas in the YOSEMITE study, improvement was greater in both faricimab arms and non-inferiority 
was demonstrated. However, there were discrepancies in the aflibercept arms regarding this endpoint 
in the two studies. Faricimab treated patients in both studies demonstrated greater reduction in CST 
from baseline than aflibercept. However, the improvement in the anatomic outcome CST did not seem 
to translate into a further improvement in the visual outcomes, where the outcomes were similar 
between the treatment arms. Sub-group analysis showed similar improvement from baseline in BCVA 
in treatment naïve and pre-treated patients in both studies. 
In the RHINE and YOSEMITE studies 51% and 52.8% respectively of participants on a PTI dosing 
interval were on a Q16W treatment interval at Week 52 and 20.1% and 21% were on a Q12W 
treatment interval. Across the two studies approximately 65% maintained a Q12W or Q16W dosing 
interval without a decrease in injection interval below Q12W. However, the results of this analysis was 
not considered to be very informative, as it was done at week 52.  In the D120 response, the Applicant 
explained that within the 2-year period of the study, the patients in the faricimab PTI arm could have 
up to a maximum of four full Q16W dosing cycles and up to a maximum of six full cycles of Q12W 
dosing. This is considered to be acceptable in order to fully investigate the treatment potential of these 
intervals in the PTI arm. The Applicant provided further data showing the proportion of patients in the 
PTI arm on a Q4W, Q8W, Q12W or Q16W treatment interval at week 96. The results were consistent 
between the YOSEMITE and RHINE study and show that approximately 62% of the patients were on a 
 
Q16W interval and 16% were on a Q12W interval at week 96. The Applicant further corroborated the 
adequacy of the treat-and-extend regimen by providing additional analyses on proportion of patients in 
the faricimab PTI arm who achieved a Q12W or Q16W treatment interval without an injection interval 
decrease below Q12W at Week 96 (being approximately 61%) and proportion of patients at Week 96 
who achieved a Q16W treatment interval without an injection interval decrease below Q16W (being 
approximately 55%). The number of patients who were on a Q16W interval at week 52 and remained 
on Q16W dosing through week 96 was also high (69.9% in YOSEMITE and 81.8% in RHINE). These 
results further strengthen the proposed treat-and-extend regimen. 
The Applicant provided the mean number of study drug administrations through week 56. The mean 
number of injections did not differ significantly between the three treatment arms. This is in clear 
contrast to the argumentation of the Applicant provided throughout the dossier, where it is stated that 
there might be a reduction in treatment burden. 
Analyses were also performed for the “proportion of patients with ≥ 2-Step DRS Improvement”. These 
analyses revealed that in the subgroup of patients with baseline DRSS>53, a higher proportion of 
patients in the aflibercept arm had an improvement compared to the faricimab arms. This might also 
be explainable by the small number of patients analysed in this subgroup. In response to a question by 
the CHMP, the Applicant submitted that the discrepancy regarding the “proportion of patients with ≥2-
step DRS improvement from baseline at week 52” observed in the aflibercept arms in the two main 
studies (35.8% in Yosemite and 46.8% in Rhine) was caused by the variability in this endpoint. The 
number of patients achieving a ≥2-step DRS improvement across all treatment arms in both pivotal 
studies was high and similar to historical controls (anti-VEGF pivotal trials). In addition, the newly 
provided year 2 data show maintenance of the effect regarding this endpoint throughout year 2 and 
show also more consistent results across aflibercept arms between the studies (42.2% in YOSEMITE 
and 43.8% in RHINE). 
In contrast to the Yosemite trial, in the subgroup of patients with a baseline BCVA <=63 letters a 
higher proportion of patients in the Aflibercept arm had a ≥ 2-Step DRS improvement compared to the 
Faricimab Q8W arm in Rhine. It is agreed with the Applicant that this might be a chance finding given 
variability in the endpoint and the low number of subjects in the sub-group. 
It should be noted that the phase III studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior 
to finalisation, the statistical analysis plan was updated to address intercurrent events due to COVID-
19. Further information was sought in order to better understand the potential impact of these 
intercurrent events on the study results.  Further analysis using more conservative approaches were 
sought. These analyses did not raise any concerns with regard to the robustness of the study results. 
Regarding the SmPC the posology proposed in section 4.2 should more closely reflect the approach to 
dosing for the PTI arm in the clinical studies (see SmPC comments). See SmPC for further comments 
on the sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
 
 
 
 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the clinical development for the nAMD indication was acceptable and the design of both pivotal 
Phase III studies was appropriate. Efficacy results demonstrate non-inferiority of faricimab 6 mg 
compared to 2mg aflibercept.  
With regard to the diabetic macular oedema indication overall, the results of the Phase III trials 
(Yosemite and Rhine) demonstrated non-inferiority of Faricimab 6 mg, compared with Aflibercept 2 
mg. Data has since been provided for Year 2 which confirms maintenance of effect with regard to best 
corrected visual acuity. Further data up to two years has also been provided on treatment intervals 
which support the proposed posology.  
2.4.8.  Clinical safety

Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Patients) 
Common Adverse Events (nAMD) 
Ocular AEs in the Study Eye from the Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies 
AEs by Frequency through Week 48 
Through Week 48, the incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye was comparable between the treatment 
arms (38.3% in the faricimab arm and 37.2% in the aflibercept arm), with the exception (≥1% 
difference in any treatment arms: faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) of dry eye (13 patients [2.0%] 
 
 
 
 
vs. 22 patients [3.3%]), vitreous floaters (20 patients [3.0%] vs. 11 patients [1.7%]), and retinal 
pigment epithelial tear (19 patients [2.9%] vs. 9 patients [1.4%]).  
The difference in frequency of these AEs (95% CI) were -1.37 (-3.31, 0.51) for dry eye, 1.35 (-0.43, 
3.21) for vitreous floaters, and 1.50 (-0.19, 3.30) for retinal pigment epithelial tear; the differences 
were not considered to be clinically significant. The vitreous floaters were all reported as non-serious 
and mild in severity.  
The retinal pigment epithelial tear events were mostly reported as either mild or moderate in severity. 
There were 5 patients in the faricimab arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept arm with a retinal pigment 
epithelial tear event in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters (4 patients in the 
faricimab arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept arm with vision loss ≥ 15 letters; and 1 patient with 
vision loss ≥ 30 letters in the faricimab arm). Sustained vision loss of ≥ 15 letters or ≥ 30 letters 
associated with an AE by Week 48 was measured as the change in vision defined as the highest BCVA 
recorded after the event onset until Week 48 minus the BCVA closest to and strictly before the first 
event onset;, events with vision loss ≥ 30 letters were counted in both the vision loss ≥ 15 letters and 
≥30 letters categories. 
 
 
The most common ocular AEs in the study eye (≥ 2% incidence in any treatment arm: faricimab arm 
vs. aflibercept arm) by PT were conjunctival haemorrhage (6.8% vs. 7.7%), neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) (5.7% vs. 5.7%), vitreous detachment (3.3% 
vs. 3.0%), eye pain (2.6% vs. 3.0%), dry eye (2.0% vs. 3.3%), cataract (3.0% vs. 2.1%), intraocular 
pressure increased (2.6% vs. 2.3%), vitreous floaters (3.0% vs. 1.7%), retinal pigment epithelial tear 
(2.9% vs. 1.4%), foreign body sensation in eyes (1.5% vs. 2.0%), and punctate keratitis (1.4% vs. 
2.0%) (Table below).  
The per-injection rate of ocular AEs in the study eye through Week 48 was 12.24% in the faricimab 
arm and 9.95% in the aflibercept arm. 
The per-injection rate of ocular AEs in the study eye with a ≥ 0.1% higher incidence (in faricimab arm 
vs. aflibercept arm) by PT were nAMD (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) (1.06% vs. 0.83%), vitreous 
detachment (0.52% vs. 0.41%), eye irritation (0.75% vs. 0.12%), vitreous floaters (0.50% vs. 
0.28%), cataract (0.47% vs. 0.28%), retinal pigment epithelial tear (0.45% vs. 0.18%), ocular 
discomfort (0.42% vs. 0.16%), ocular hyperaemia (0.38% vs. 0.08%), and eye discharge (0.21% vs. 
0).

Treatment Arm through Week 48 from Individual and Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies 
(Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
Ocular AEs by Treatment Relationship through Week 48 (nAMD) 
Through Week 48, the incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab 
was low (2.9%). The most common treatment-related ocular AEs in the study eye (≥ 0.5%) were 
retinal pigment epithelial tear (8 patients [1.2%]) and vitritis (3 patients [0.5%]).  
The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept was low (2.6%). 
The most common treatment-related ocular AE in the study eye (≥ 0.5%) was intraocular pressure 
increased (3 patients [0.5%]).  
 
 
 
 
Ocular AEs in the Study Eye (nAMD) 
At the time of the primary analysis, the Phase III trials continue to be ongoing. Therefore, cumulative 
safety data available as of the Clinical Cut-Off Date associated with the primary endpoint was also 
assessed (i.e., the subset of patients with follow-up data beyond Week 48). From baseline to the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date, 41.0% of patients in the faricimab arm and 40.0% of patients in the aflibercept 
arm experienced at least one ocular AE in the study eye. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the most common ocular AEs in the study eye (≥ 1% 
incidence in any treatment arm) by PT was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, 
worsening of nAMD; 7 patients [1.1%] in the faricimab arm). From baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off 
Date, 2.9% of patients in each treatment arm experienced at least one treatment related ocular AEs in 
the study eye. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the treatment-related ocular AEs in the study eye were 
intraocular pressure increased and non-infectious endophthalmitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the 
aflibercept arm. There were no treatment-related ocular AEs in the faricimab arm after Week 48 to the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date.  
Ocular AEs in the Fellow Eye through Clinical Cut-Off Date (nAMD)   
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 29.2% in the faricimab arm 
and 26.9% in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one ocular AE in the fellow eye. After Week 48 
to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the most common ocular AEs in the fellow eye (≥ 2% incidence in any 
treatment arm) by PT was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of 
nAMD; 2.1% in the faricimab arm).  
Ocular AEs in Study Eye by Severity from the Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies  
The majority of ocular AEs in the study eye through Week 48 were mild or moderate in severity in the 
faricimab and aflibercept treatment arms. Through Week 48, 13 patients (2.0%) in the faricimab arm 
and 11 patients (1.7%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one severe ocular AE in the study 
eye. The severe ocular AEs in the study eye in the faricimab arm by PT were retinal pigment epithelial 
tear, uveitis, intraocular pressure increased (2 patients [0.3%] each), neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD), eye pain, cataract, punctate keratitis, subretinal fibrosis, 
cataract nuclear, hyalosis asteroid, procedural pain, viral uveitis, chorioretinitis (viral) (1 patient 
[0.2%] each).  
The severe ocular AEs in the study eye in the aflibercept arm by PT were neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) (3 patients [0.5%]), eye pain, subretinal 
fibrosis, vitreoretinal traction syndrome, uveitis, cataract cortical, diplopia, intraocular pressure 
increased, and blepharal papilloma (1 patient [0.2%] each).  
The severe ocular AEs in the study eye that were not resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date were retinal 
pigment epithelial tear (2 events), cataract nuclear, cataract, subretinal fibrosis, and uveitis (1 event 
each) in the faricimab arm; and vitreoretinal traction syndrome and subretinal fibrosis (1 event each) 
in the aflibercept arm.  
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 3 patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 5 patients 
(0.8%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one severe ocular AE in the study eye. The severe 
ocular AEs in the study eye by PT were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, 
worsening of nAMD), blepharitis, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 patient [0.2%] each) in 
the faricimab arm; and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD), 
macular fibrosis, visual acuity reduced, cataract operation complication, and cataract traumatic (1 
patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the severe 
ocular AEs in the study eye were not suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
The majority of the severe ocular AEs (62.5% [5/8]) in the study eye that occurred after Week 48 to 
the Clinical Cut-Off Date resolved or were resolving with the exception of 3 ocular AEs that were not 
resolved (neovascular age-related macular degeneration [verbatim, worsening of nAMD], visual acuity 
reduced, and macular fibrosis, all in the aflibercept arm) by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. 
Ocular Adverse Events of Special Interest (nAMD)   
Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) 
Adverse events of special interest were required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately: 
Adverse events of special interest for this study were as follows: 
•  Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination 
with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law 
•  Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below: Any 
organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A 
transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory 
findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term 
applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
•  Sight-threatening adverse events: an adverse event is considered to be sight-threatening and 
should be reported expeditiously if it meets one or more of the following criteria: 
– It causes a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score (compared with the last assessment of 
VA prior to the most recent assessment) lasting more than 1 hour. 
– It requires surgical or medical intervention (i.e., conventional surgery, vitrectomy, 
vitreous tap, or biopsy with IVT injection of anti-infective treatments, or laser or retinal 
cryopexy with gas, or a medication) to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
– It is associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., endophthalmitis, 4+ anterior 
chamber cell/flare, or 4+ vitritis) 
 All of the above listed sight-threatening adverse events should be reported as serious adverse events, 
listing the underlying cause (if known) of the event as the primary 
Sight-Threatening Adverse Events Through Week 48 (nAMD)    
Through Week 48, the incidence of AESIs in the study eye was low and comparable between the 
treatment arms (8 patients [1.2%] in the faricimab arm and 12 patients [1.8%] in the aflibercept arm; 
Table 53). Through Week 48, the most common sight-threatening AE in the study eye which caused a 
decrease of ≥30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour (≥2 patients in any treatment arm) by PT 
were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) and retinal 
pigment epithelial tear (2 patients [0.3%] each) in the faricimab arm; and neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 2 patients [0.3%]) in the aflibercept arm.  
Through Week 48, the sight-threatening AEs in the study eye which was associated with severe 
intraocular inflammation by PT were chorioretinitis (viral; 1 patient [0.2%]) in the faricimab arm; and 
corneal abrasion and endophthalmitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. The 
chorioretinitis event in the faricimab arm was reported as viral choriretinitis based on serology 
assessment and of herpectic origin. 
Through Week 48, the only sight-threatening AE in the study eye which required surgical or medical 
intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight was neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
(verbatim, neovascular age-related macular degeneration; 1 patient [0.2%]) in the aflibercept arm; 
the patient underwent a tissue plasminogen activated vitrectomy. There were no events in the 
faricimab arm. The majority of the ocular AESIs in the study eye resolved, resolved with sequelae, or 
were resolving by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. The sight-threatening AEs in the study eye which caused a 
decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour that were not resolved by Week 48 were 
retinal pigment epithelial tear (2 events) and cataract in the faricimab arm; and subretinal fibrosis in 
the aflibercept arm. The per-injection rate of AESIs in the study eye was 0.21% in the faricimab arm 
and 0.24% in the aflibercept arm. 
Table 53. (nAMD)  Adverse Events of Special Interest in the Study Eye through Week 48 
from Individual and Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
Sight-Threatening Adverse Events up to Clinical Cut-Off Date in the Study Eye (nAMD)    
Through cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 1.7% of patients in the faricimab 
arm and 2.6% of patients in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one AESI in the study eye. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the sight-threatening AEs in the study eye which caused a 
decrease of ≥30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour by PT were visual acuity reduced (1 
patient [0.2%]) in the faricimab arm; and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, 
worsening of nAMD), cataract, visual acuity reduced, cataract traumatic, and retinal degeneration (1 
patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the sight-
threatening AEs in the study eye which required surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent 
loss of sight by PT were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) 
and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and cataract 
operation complication (1 patient [0.2%]) in the aflibercept arm. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off 
Date, there were no sight-threatening AEs in the study eye which was associated with severe 
intraocular inflammation. 
 
 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there was 1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept arm with a 
suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug (non-infectious endophthalmitis).  
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the majority of the ocular AESIs in the study eye resolved 
or were resolving by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. The sight-threatening AEs in the study eye which caused 
a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour that were not resolved by the Clinical 
Cut-Off Date were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD), 
retinal degeneration, and visual acuity reduced in the aflibercept arm.  
Ocular Selected Adverse Events Intraocular Inflammation Events through Week 48 (nAMD)    
Through Week 48, the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) events in the study eye was low and 
comparable between the treatment arms (13 patients [2.0%] in the faricimab arm and 8 patients 
[1.2%] in the aflibercept arm). There were no IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive 
disease in any treatment arms based on the reported preferred terms.  
There were 2 patients with an IOI event in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters (1 
patient with vision loss ≥ 15 letters and 1 patient with vision loss ≥30 letters); both patients were in 
the faricimab arm. The IOI event in the study eye associated with the patient with vision loss ≥15 
letters was chorioretinitis (viral); this event was considered serious, suspected by the investigator not 
to be related to study treatment (related to varicella zoster), and resolving by Week 48. 
The IOI event in the study eye associated with the patient with vision loss ≥ 30 letters was uveitis; this 
event was suspected to be related to study treatment, serious, and resolving by Week 48. Sustained 
vision loss of ≥ 15 letters or ≥ 30 letters associated with an AE by Week 48 was measured as the 
change in vision defined as the highest BCVA recorded after the event onset until Week 48 minus the 
BCVA closest to and strictly before the first event onset; in the table, events with vision loss ≥ 30 
letters were counted in both the vision loss ≥ 15 letters and ≥30 letters categories.  
The most common IOI events in the study eye (≥2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab arm vs. 
aflibercept arm) by PT were iridocyclitis (3 patients [0.5%] vs. 2 patients [0.3%]), iritis (3 patients 
[0.5%] vs. 2 patients [0.3%]), uveitis (2 patients [0.3%] in each arm), and vitritis (3 patients [0.5%] 
vs. 1 patient [0.2%]).  
Through Week 48, 3 patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept arm 
experienced at least one severe IOI event in the study eye. The severe IOI events in the study eye 
(treatment arm: faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) by PT were uveitis (2 patients [0.3%] vs. 1 patient 
[0.2%]) and chorioretinitis (viral;1 patient [0.2%] vs. 0). The AE severity grading scale is provided in 
Table 54. Five patients in the faricimab arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept arm experienced a serious 
 
 
IOI event in the study eye. The serious IOI events by PT were uveitis (2 events), vitritis (2 events), 
and chorioretinitis (viral) in the faricimab arm; and uveitis in the aflibercept arm. Two of the serious 
IOI events were associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters (1 patient with chorioretinitis [viral] with vision 
loss ≥ 15 letters and 1 patient with uveitis with vision loss ≥ 30 letters); 1 of these serious IOI events 
(uveitis) in the faricimab arm was not resolved by Week 48. There was no clear relationship between 
injection day of study treatment and the timing of the IOI events. The majority of the IOI events 
occurred after the initial loading doses, 4 to 5 injections (range: 1−8) of faricimab and after 4 or 6 
injections (range: 3−8) of aflibercept.  
Through Week 48, the incidence of IOI events occurring in the fellow eye was low (3 patients [0.5%] 
in the faricimab arm and 4 patients [0.6%] in the aflibercept arm). The IOI events in the fellow eye 
(treatment arm: faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) by PT were post procedural inflammation (2 
patients [0.3%] vs. 1 patient [0.2%]), iritis (1 patient [0.2%] in each arm), iridocyclitis (0 vs. 1 
patient [0.2%]), and uveitis (0 vs. 1 patient [0.2%]).  
Intraocular Inflammation Events up to Clinical Cut-Off Date (nAMD)   
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2.3% in the faricimab arm and 
1.5% in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one IOI event in the study eye. The 2 IOI events in 
the study eye associated with vision loss ≥15 letters through Week 48 (chorioretinitis and uveitis) were 
still resolving by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no 
additional patients with an IOI in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the IOI events in the study eye by PT were iritis and vitritis 
(1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and post procedural inflammation (i.e., post-cataract 
operation inflammation) and non-infectious endophthalmitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept 
arm.  
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, all of the IOI events in the study eye were mild or moderate 
in severity. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no additional IOI events in the fellow eye. 
Retinal Vascular Occlusive Disease Through Week 48 (nAMD)   
Through Week 48, 1 patient [0.2%] in the faricimab arm was found to have a retinal artery embolism 
AE (Hollenhorst plaque) in the study eye during clinical examination. The finding was not associated 
with any retinal vascular occlusion, and was noted during the clinical examination and confirmed with 
fundus fluorescein angiography. There was no anterior or posterior segment inflammation noted at any 
visit from the date of AE onset through follow up. The retinal artery embolism AE (Hollenhorst plaque) 
 
had no impact on vision (BCVA immediately before the event: 70 letters; on day of onset: 70 letters; 
from AE onset to Clinical Cut-Off Date, range 63−70 letters). It was reported that on follow-up with the 
cardiologist, no abnormality was found. The retinal artery embolism AE (Hollenhorst plaque) was 
considered non-serious, suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment, and not 
resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no additional retinal vascular occlusive disease 
AEs in the study eye. 
Intraocular Pressure Mean (nAMD) 
Pre-dose IOP and mean IOP change from baseline over time through the Clinical Cut-Off Date in the 
study eye were comparable between the faricimab and aflibercept arms. 
There was no observable increase in pre-dose IOP over time. Overall, mean IOP changes from pre-
dose to post-dose by visit in the treatment arms were similar. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the mean change from pre-dose to post-dose IOP 
across the treatment arms. Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 18 patients (2.7%) in each treatment 
arm experienced an intraocular pressure increased AE in the study eye. One of the intraocular pressure 
increased AEs (in the faricimab arm) was considered serious, suspected by the investigator not to be 
related to study treatment, and resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. 
Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 4 patients (0.6%) in the faricimab arm and 5 patients (0.8%) in the 
aflibercept arm developed ocular hypertension in the study eye. One of the patients in the faricimab 
arm experienced worsening of pre-existing ocular hypertension. Two of the ocular hypertension AEs in 
the study eye (both in the aflibercept arm) were suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment and not resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. None of these ocular hypertension AEs were 
considered serious.  
Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 3 patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 5 patients (0.8%) in the 
aflibercept arm developed glaucoma in the study eye. Two of the patients in the faricimab arm and 1 of 
the patients in the aflibercept arm experienced worsening of pre-existing glaucoma.  
 
 
Slitlamp Examination (nAMD) 
The proportion of patients by grade for the worst post-baseline outcome in the study eye through the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date on slitlamp examination including intraocular inflammation, cataract and vitreous 
haemorrhage were generally comparable between the treatment arms. 
A small proportion of patients developed new or worsened cataracts by Week 84 (latest visit 
corresponding to the Clinical Cut-Off Date), and the distribution of cataract by grade was generally 
comparable between the treatment arms.  
Slitlamp Findings in the Study Eye through Clinical Cut-Off Date from Pooled Phase III nAMD 
Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) (nAMD)   
 
 
 
Indirect Ophthalmoscopy (nAMD) 
The proportion of patients having any post-baseline retinal break or retinal detachment through the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date in the study eye were low and comparable between the treatment arms (see 
Table below).  
At baseline, 1 patient (0.2%) in the faricimab arm was reported to have developed a new retinal break 
in the study eye since their Screening visit, which was attributed to a new serous macular detachment 
secondary to nAMD. Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab arm 
experienced any post-baseline retinal break in the study eye (1 patient attributed to a serous macular 
detachment secondary to nAMD and 1 patient with posterior vitreal detachment and peripheral retinal 
break which was repaired by photocoagulation). There were no patients in the aflibercept arm that 
experienced a retinal break in the study eye at baseline or through the Clinical Cut-Off Date. At 
baseline, 14 patients (2.1%) in the faricimab arm and 11 patients (1.7%) in the aflibercept arm were 
reported to have a retinal detachment in the study eye. These baseline detachments were serous 
macular detachments secondary to nAMD. 2.4% of patients in the faricimab arm and 1.7% of patients 
in the aflibercept arm developed any post-baseline retinal detachment in the study eye; the majority of 
these were serous macular detachments secondary to nAMD. One patient had a rhegmatogenous 
retinal detachment in the study eye (faricimab arm), which occurred after the Week 52 visit and was 
repaired prior to the Week 56 visit.

Ocular safety from Supportive Phase II nAMD Study STAIRWAY (CR39521) 
STAIRWAY is a completed Phase II, multicenter, randomised, active comparator-controlled, subject 
and outcome-assessor masked, parallel group (three treatment arms), 52-week study investigating the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 6-mg faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 
Q12W and Q16W in treatment-naive patients with nAMD. 
 
A total of 76 patients from 25 sites in the United States were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 
three treatment arms (29 patients to the 6 mg faricimab Q12W arm, 31 patients to the 6 mg faricimab 
Q16W arm, and 16 patients to the 0.5 mg ranibizumab Q4W arm). 
Overall, 6 mg of faricimab administered Q12W or Q16W was generally well tolerated, and no new 
safety signals were observed. Treatment with 6 mg of faricimab resulted in generally consistent overall 
ocular and non-ocular safety in nAMD patients compared with 0.5 mg of ranibizumab administered 
Q4W through Week 52. 
Treatment exposure and the key safety results are summarized below:  
• 
• 
• 
The median duration of treatment exposure in the study eye was comparable across the three 
treatment arms: 339 days (range: 57− 344) in the faricimab Q12W arm, 311 days (range: 30− 
341) in the faricimab Q16W arm, and 338 days (range: 330−344) in the ranibizumab Q4W 
arm.  
The incidence of AEs was generally similar across the three treatment arms (75.0%, 74.2%, 
and 81.3% in the faricimab Q12W, faricimab Q16W, and ranibizumab Q4W arms, respectively).  
The incidence of ocular AEs occurring in the study eye was numerically lower in the faricimab 
treatment arms compared to the ranibizumab arm (37.5% and 35.5% in the faricimab Q12W 
and Q16W arms compared with 50.0% in the ranibizumab Q4W arm); all ocular AEs occurring 
in the study eye in the faricimab and ranibizumab arms were of mild or moderate intensity, 
with the exception of one severe AE (eye pain) reported in the ranibizumab arm.  
• 
The most common ocular AEs in the study eye (≥2 patients: faricimab Q12W, faricimab Q16W, 
and ranibizumab Q4W arms, respectively) were conjunctival haemorrhage (5 patients, 4 
patients, and 4 patients), eye pain (2 patients, no patients, and 2 patients), and retinal 
haemorrhage ( 2 patients, no patients, and no patients).  
• 
There were no serious ocular AEs reported in the study or fellow eye.  
•  No AEs were reported that led to discontinuation of treatment. Two patients experienced 4 AEs 
that led to a dose interruption of the study drug in the 6 mg faricimab Q12W arm including the 
AEs of fall, headache and mental status changes for one patient and chalazion for the other 
patient. 
One patient in the faricimab Q12W arm had a sight-threatening event (AESI) of visual acuity reduced 
(BCVA score at AE onset on Study Day 46: 24 letters, BCVA score from previous assessment: 59 
letters) in the study eye, which was considered unrelated to study treatment and resolved (BCVA score 
at AE resolution on Study Day 88: 58 letters). No non-ocular AESIs were reported in the study.  
• 
Two mild ocular inflammatory events (iritis and anterior chamber flare) were reported in the 
study eye in the faricimab arms, both of which resolved within 3 weeks of onset. 
Supportive Phase II nAMD Study AVENUE (BP29647)-ocular safety: 
AVENUE is a completed Phase II multicenter, multiple-dose and regimen, randomized, active 
comparator controlled, double masked, parallel group (five treatment arms), 36-week study 
investigating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 1.5 mg and 6 mg faricimab 
administered by intravitreal injection at Q4W and Q8W in treatment-naive and anti-VEGF-incomplete-
responder patients with nAMD.  
A total of 273 treatment-naive patients with nAMD at 58 sites in the United States were enrolled in the 
study and randomized (Arm A: 68 patients, Arm B: 47, Arm C: 42, Arm D: 47, and Arm E: 69). 
 
Non-Ocular AEs from the Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies  
Through Week 48, the incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable between the treatment arms 
(52.1% of patients in the faricimab arm and 54.8% of patients in the aflibercept arm), with the 
exception (≥ 1% difference in any treatment arms: faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) of hypertension 
(3.6% vs. 2.4%), arthralgia (3.0% vs. 1.7%), fall (1.8% vs. 2.9%), bronchitis (2.6% vs. 1.4%), blood 
pressure increased (0.2% vs. 1.2%), and dyspnoea (0.2% vs. 1.2%).  
The most common non-ocular AEs (≥5% incidence in any treatment arm) by PT was nasopharyngitis 
(6.3% in the faricimab arm and 6.6% in the aflibercept arm). The majority of non-ocular AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity in both the faricimab arm and aflibercept arm. 
Through Week 48, 5.6% of patients in the faricimab arm and 10.0% of patients in the aflibercept arm 
experienced at least one severe non-ocular. 
Table (nAMD) Non-Ocular Adverse Events (≥2%) through Week 48 from Individual and 
Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 56.8% of patients in the 
faricimab arm and 59.1% of patients in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one non-ocular AE. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the most common non-ocular AEs (≥1% incidence in any 
treatment arm: faricimab vs. aflibercept arm) by PT were urinary tract infection (10 patients [1.5%] 
vs. 8 patients [1.2%]) and fall (11 patients [1.7%] in each arm).  
Serious Non-Ocular AEs Through Week 48 (nAMD)  
Through Week 48, the incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was comparable between the treatment 
arms (10.2% of patients in the faricimab arm and 12.4% of patients in the aflibercept arm). The most 
common serious non-ocular AEs through Week 48 (≥ 0.5% incidence in any treatment arm) are 
presented in the Table below.

Arm through Week 48 from Individual and Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-
Evaluable Population) 
nAMD: SAFETY DATA THROUGH WEEK 60  
The extent of exposure and safety results based on the pooled data from the two pivotal Phase III 
Studies TENAYA and LUCERNE up to Week 60 and up to the Week 60 Clinical Cut-Off Date of 19 
January 2021 for TENAYA and 28 December 2020 for LUCERNE are presented below. The safety results 
up to Week 48 are presented below for comparison and are based on the original Week 48 results for 
Clinical Cut-Off Date of 26 October 2020 for TENAYA and 05 October 2020 for LUCERNE. The safety 
profile of faricimab up to Week 60 is consistent with the safety profile up to Week 48 with no new or 
unexpected safety signals identified for the study through the Week 60 Clinical Cut-Off Date.  
Table 56 (nAMD)   Overview of Safety from Phase III nAMD Studies through Week 48 and 
Week 60 from Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Patients) 
 
 
Non-Ocular Adverse Events by Frequency (nAMD) 
Through Week 60, the incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable between the treatment arms and 
generally consistent with the Week 48 dataset considering the increase in exposure duration 
(faricimab: 58.4% [Week 60] and 52.1% [Week 48] vs. aflibercept: 60.1% [Week 60] and 54.8% 
[Week 48]. 
Non-Ocular Adverse Events of Special Interest (nAMD) 
Between Week 48 and Week 60, there were no additional non-ocular AESIs.  
Through Week 60, the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an 
independent clinical coding committee) remained low and was comparable between the treatment 
arms (faricimab: 2.0% [Week 60] and 1.1% [Week 48] vs. aflibercept: 1.5% [Week 60] and 0.9% 
[Week 48]. 
Between Week 48 and Week 60, the death adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs were cardiac failure 
congestive, ill-defined disorder, pneumonia bacterial, pulmonary oedema, and subarachnoid 
haemorrhage (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and cardiac failure and glioblastoma 
multiforme (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. None of the death adjudicated APTC ATEs 
were suspected to be related to study treatment. Between Week 48 and Week 60, there was 1 patient 
(0.2%) in the faricimab arm and 2 patients (0.3%) in the aflibercept arm who experienced a non-fatal 
stroke (cerebrovascular accident in all patients). None of the non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs 
were suspected to be related to study treatment. Two of the cerebrovascular accident events (1 in the 
faricimab arm and 1 in the aflibercept arm) occurred prior to the Week 48 data cutoff but the 
adjudication information for these events were not available until the Week 60 data cutoff; hence, 
these events were not included in the Week 48 dataset but rather the Week 60 dataset. Between Week 
48 and Week 60, there were no non-fatal MI adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs in both treatment arms. 
Non-ocular events from supportive Phase II study STAIRWAY- nAMD indication 
The incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable between the treatment arms (58.3%, 64.5%, and 
56.3% in the faricimab Q12W, faricimab Q16W, and ranibizumab Q4W arms, respectively). None of the 
non-ocular AEs reported were considered related to study treatment.  
In total, 7 patients experienced a non-ocular SAE across the faricimab arms; no patients in the 
ranibizumab arm experienced a non-ocular SAE. There were two APTC events reported in the study: 
 
non-fatal cerebral infarction and fatal ischemic stroke, both of which were reported in the faricimab 
Q12W arm. Of note these events were not part of the external APTC adjudication process which was 
subsequently established. 
Supportive Phase II nAMD Study AVENUE (BP29647) 
Overall, 170 patients (64.9%) experienced non-ocular AEs. The incidence was generally comparable 
between treatment arms (55.2%, 80.4%, 59.0%, 65.2%, and 67.2% for 0.5 mg ranibizumab Arm A, 
1.5 mg faricimab Arm B, 6 mg faricimab Arm C, 6 mg faricimab Q4W/6 mg faricimab Q8W Arm D, 0.5 
mg ranibizumab/6 mg faricimab Arm E, respectively); however, the percentage was higher in the 1.5 
mg faricimab Arm B. • 33 (12.6%) patients reported non-ocular SAEs. None of the non-ocular AEs 
reported were considered related to study treatment. 
There were four APTC events reported during the study: 1 event in the 6 mg faricimab Arm C (acute 
myocardial infarction), 1 in the 6 mg faricimab Q4W/Q8W Arm D (basal ganglia infarction), and 2 in 
the 0.5 mg ranibizumab/6 mg faricimab Arm E (cerebrovascular accident during ranibizumab treatment

the external APTC adjudication process which was subsequently established. 
Phase III nAMD and DME: ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS  
The ocular ADRs in the study eye through Week 48 for nAMD and Week 56 for DME were pooled across 
indications. The list of ADRs is presented in Table 57.  
The most common pooled ADRs (≥ 2% incidence in any treatment arm: combined faricimab arms vs. 
aflibercept arm) by PT were conjunctival haemorrhage (6.7% vs. 6.9%), vitreous floaters (3.3% vs. 
1.6%), intraocular pressure increased (2.8% vs. 2.2%), and eye pain (2.3% vs. 3.0%).

and Pooled Phase III DME Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
Intraocular Inflammation Events (IOI) until week 56- the Pooled Phase III DME Studies 
DME indication 
Through Week 56, the incidence of IOI events in the study eye was low and generally comparable 
across all treatment arms (8 patients [1.3%], 9 patients [1.4%], and 4 patients [0.6%] in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). There were no IOI events 
associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in any treatment arms based on the reported 
preferred terms. 
There were 2 patients with at least one IOI event in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 15 
letters (1 patient with vision loss ≥15 letters and 1 patient with vision loss ≥ 30 letters); both patients 
were in the faricimab PTI arm. 
• 
• 
The IOI events in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters were uveitis and 
chorioretinitis. Prior to these events, the patient received a total of 9 injections of study 
treatment with the uveitis event occurring 21 days after the last injection followed by 
chorioretinitis 6 days after. Both were suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment, serious, and resolving by Week 56. 
The IOI events in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 30 letters were keratic 
precipitates and uveitis. Prior to the keratic precipitates event, the patient received a total of 9 
injections of study treatment with the event occurring 77 days after the last injection; this 
event was suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment, non-serious, and not 
resolved by Week 56. Prior to the uveitis event, the patient received a total of 11 injections of 
study treatment with the event occurring 4 days after the last injection; this event was 
suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment, serious, and resolving by Week 
56.  
The most common IOI events in the study eye (≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively) by PT were iritis (2 patients [0.3%], 3 patients

patients [0.3%], and 0). 
Through Week 56, the per-injection rate of IOI events in the study eye was low and generally 
comparable (0.17%, 0.28%, and 0.10% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively).  
The majority of IOI events in the study eye were mild or moderate in severity in the combined 
faricimab arms and aflibercept Q8W arms.  
Severe IOI events - the Pooled Phase III DME Studies- DME indication 
Through Week 56, 1 patient (0.2%) and 2 patients (0.3%) experienced at least one severe IOI event 
in the study eye in the faricimab Q8W and faricimab PTI, respectively. 
The severe IOI events in the study eye by PT were vitritis (1 patient [0.2%]) in the faricimab Q8W arm 
and uveitis (2 patients [0.3%]) in the faricimab PTI arm. There were no severe IOI events in the study 
eye in the aflibercept Q8W arm.  
There was one IOI SAE of reported keratouveitis suspected to be related to possible herpetic origin. 
There was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and the timing of the IOI 
events. The majority of the IOI events occurred after the initial loading doses, 6 or 8 injections (range: 
28) of faricimab (in the Q8W arm) and 4 to 5 injections (range: 4-11) of faricimab (in the PTI arm); 
and all IOI events occurred after 3 to 7 injections of aflibercept. 
Intraocular Inflammation Events (IOI) after week 56 DME indication 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 8 patients (1.3%), 11 patients 
(1.7%), and 7 patients (1.1%) experienced at least one IOI event in the study eye in the faricimab 
Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively.  After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off 
Date, there were no additional IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in any 
treatment arms. After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there was 1 additional patient with an IOI 
event in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥ 30 letters in the aflibercept Q8W arm; the IOI 
event was iridocyclitis and was considered non-serious, suspected by the investigator not to be related 
to study treatment, and not resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date.

Two of the retinal vascular occlusive disease AEs in the study eye were considered serious (retinal vein 
occlusion in the faricimab PTI arm and retinal artery occlusion in the aflibercept Q8W arm). The serious 
retinal vein occlusion and serious retinal artery occlusion AEs were both suspected by the investigator 
not to be related to study treatment and resolved or resolved with sequelae by the Clinical Cut-Off 
Date, respectively. 
Upon slitlamp examination, no findings of inflammation (no cells or flare) were reported for the retinal 
vein occlusions in the faricimab arms. For the retinal artery embolism in the aflibercept Q8W arm there 
was minimal (trace) inflammation reported. For the retinal artery occlusion in the aflibercept Q8W arm, 
conjunctival hyperaemia, corneal edema, rubeosis iridis, and hyphema were found on slitlamp 
examination, and there were no cells or flare reported. 
Retinal Vascular Occlusive Disease up to Clinical Cut-Off Date DME indication 
After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there was 1 additional patient with a retinal vascular  
occlusive disease AE in the study eye (retinal artery occlusion [1 patient, 0.2%] in the faricimab Q8W 
arm; The retinal artery occlusion AE was considered non-serious, suspected by the investigator not to 
be related to study treatment, and not resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date.  
For the retinal artery occlusion, dry cornea and cataract were found on slitlamp examination, with trace 
cells in the anterior chamber.

The death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab arm and 3 
patients (0.5%) in the aflibercept arm. All death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 1 patient 
each. None of the death adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment. The non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 3 
patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 2 patients (0.3%) in the aflibercept arm. The most common 
non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs (≥2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab 
arm vs. aflibercept arm) by PT was acute myocardial infarction (2 patients [0.3%] vs. 1 patient 
[0.2%]). None of the non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment. The non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were 
reported in 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab arm and 1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept arm. All 
non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 1 patient each.  
Two of the non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment: thrombotic cerebral infarction in the faricimab arm and cerebrovascular accident in 
the aflibercept arm.  
Supporting data from phase II study STAIRWAY in nAMD indication: 
Three patients experienced AEs with a fatal outcome (1 patient in the faricimab Q12W arm with cause 
of death due to ischemic stroke [APTC event] and 2 patients in the faricimab Q16W arm with cause of 
death as sepsis and metastatic neoplasm, respectively). None of the fatal AEs reported were 
considered related to study treatment. 
Serious Ocular AEs in the Study Eye from the Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies  
Through Week 48, the incidence of serious ocular AEs occurring in the study eye was low and 
comparable between the treatment arms (1.7% in the faricimab arm and 2.0% in the aflibercept arm), 
with the exception (≥ 0.5% difference in any treatment arms) of retinal pigment epithelial tear (4 
patients [0.6%] in the faricimab arm and no patients in the aflibercept arm).  
 
 
The most common serious ocular AEs in the study eye ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm) by PT were 
retinal pigment epithelial tear (4 patients [0.6%]), neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
(verbatim, worsening of nAMD), uveitis, viral uveitis, and vitritis (2 patients [0.3%] each) in the 
faricimab arm; and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 3 
patients [0.5%]) in the aflibercept arm (Figure 60). Four patients experienced a serious retinal 
pigment epithelial tear event in the study eye; all patients were in the faricimab arm.

through Week 48 from Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2.1% of patients in the 
faricimab arm and 2.7% of patients in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one serious ocular AE in 
the study eye. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the serious ocular AEs in the study eye by PT 
were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD), visual acuity 
reduced, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD), cataract, visual acuity 
reduced, cataract operation complication, cataract traumatic, non-infectious endophthalmitis, and 
retinal degeneration (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. The non-infectious endophthalmitis 
serious ocular AE in the study eye in the aflibercept arm was suspected by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment and had resolved by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. 
Through Week 48, the incidence of serious ocular AEs occurring in the fellow eye was low in the 
treatment arms (7 patients [1.1%] in each treatment arm). The most common serious ocular AEs in 
the fellow eye (≥2 patients in any treatment arm) by PT were neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 3 patients [0.5%]) in the faricimab arm; and neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD) and rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment (2 patients [0.3%] each) in the aflibercept arm.

Deaths through Week 56- from the Pooled Phase III DME Studies 
In total, through Week 56, death was reported in 31 patients (13 patients [2.1%], 9 patients [1.4%], 
and 9 patients [1.4%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively;). 
The most common primary cause of death ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively) were death (cause unknown) (1 patient [7.7%], 
3 patients [33.3%], and 0), acute myocardial infarction (1 patient [7.7%], 0, and 2 patients [22.2%]), 
bladder cancer (2 patients [15.4%], 0, and 0 ), cardiac arrest (2 patients [15.4%], 0, and 0 ), and 
cardiac failure (0, 2 patients [22.2%], and 0). None of the deaths were suspected by the investigator 
to be related to study treatment.

Other Serious Adverse Events- from the Pooled Phase III DME Studies 
Diabetic macular edema (DME)-Serious Ocular AEs in the Study Eye Through Week 56 
A higher incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in both faricimab  arms compared 
with the aflibercept Q8W arm (15 patients [2.4%], 19 patients [3.0%], and 8 patients [1.3%] in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively; However, the incidence was 
overall low, and there was no consistent pattern observed at the individual PT level between the 
treatment arms.  
The most common serious ocular AEs in the study eye (≥ 2 patients in the combined faricimab arms or 
aflibercept Q8W arm) by PT were diabetic retinal oedema (verbatim, worsening of diabetic retinal 
oedema; 5 patients [0.4%] vs. 0), endophthalmitis (4 patients [0.3%] vs. 1 patient [0.2%]), cataract 
(2 patients [0.2%] vs. 2 patients [0.3%]), vitreous haemorrhage (3 patients [0.2%] vs. 1 patient 
[0.2%]), uveitis (3 patients [0.2%] vs. 0), visual acuity reduced transiently (2 patients [0.2%] vs. 1 
patient [0.2%]), ocular hypertension (2 patients [0.2%] vs. 0), and retinal tear (2 patients [0.2%] vs. 
0). 
The majority of the serious ocular AEs in the study eye resolved, resolved with sequelae, or were 
resolving by Week 56.  The serious ocular AEs in the study eye that were not resolved by Week 56 
were cataract (2 events), uveitic glaucoma, dry eye, and retinal tear (1 event each). 
Through Week 56, 5 patients (0.8%) in the faricimab PTI arm experienced at least one serious ocular 
AE suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab.  The serious ocular AEs related to 
faricimab in the PTI arm were uveitis (3 patients [0.5%]), chorioretinitis, keratouveitis, and ocular 
hypertension (1 patient [0.2% each]). All of these serious ocular AEs related to faricimab in the PTI 
 
arm were either resolved, resolved with sequelae, or resolving by Week 56. There were no serious 
ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment in the faricimab Q8W or 
aflibercept Q8W arms. 
The per-injection rate of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was 0.34%, 0.39%, and 0.14% in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively. 
Diabetic retinal oedema (verbatim, worsening of diabetic retinal oedema; 0.06% in the combined 
faricimab arms vs. 0 in the aflibercept Q8W arm) was the only serious ocular AE in the study eye with 
a ≥ 0.05% per-injection rate difference in the combined faricimab arms compared to the aflibercept 
Q8W arm.

Pooled Phase III DME Studies (Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population) 
Diabetic macular edema (DME)-Serious Ocular AEs in fellow Eye Through Week 56 
Through Week 56, the incidence of serious ocular AEs occurring in the fellow eye was low across 
treatment arms (13 patients [2.1%], 11 patients [1.7%], and 8 patients [1.3%] in the faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
The most common serious ocular AEs in the fellow eye ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab 
Q8W, faricimab PTI, aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively) by PT were vitreous haemorrhage (5 patients 
[0.8%], 1 patient [0.2%], and 1 patient [0.2%]), diabetic retinopathy (2 patients [0.3%], 2 patients 
[0.3%], and 1 patient [0.2%]), and diabetic retinal oedema (verbatim, worsening of diabetic retinal

Diabetic macular edema (DME)-Adjudicated APTC-Defined ATEs- from the Pooled Phase III 
DME Studies 
For this study, potential Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) events were identified and 
forwarded to an Independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC), with event source documents on an 
ongoing basis for proactive adjudication of APTC-defined ATEs. The role of the CEC was to adjudicate 
potential APTC events in a blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner throughout the course of the 
study. APTC events described in the CSR are based on external adjudication. 
Through Week 56 DME indication 
Through Week 56, the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an 
independent clinical coding committee) was low and comparable across treatment arms (2.1%, 1.9%, 
and 2.2% in the faricimab Q8W, and faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms,). 
The death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 5 patients (0.8%), 6 patients (0.9%), and 4 
patients (0.6%) in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The 
most common death adjudicated APTC ATEs ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively) by PT were myocardial infarction (1 patient 
[0.2%], 2 patients [0.3%], and 1 patient [0.2%]) and death (1 patient [0.2%], 2 patients [0.3%], and 
0). None of the death adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. 
The non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 4 patients (0.6%), 2 
patients (0.3%), and 6 patients (1.0%) in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively. The most common non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs by PT 
were acute myocardial infarction (1 patient [0.2%], 1 patient [0.2%], and 3 patients [0.5%]) and 
myocardial infarction (1 patient [0.2%], 1 patient [0.2%], and 3 patients [0.5%]). One of the non-
fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs was suspected by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment: acute myocardial infarction in the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
The non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 4 patients (0.6%) in each treatment arm 
(faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms). The most common non-fatal stroke 
adjudicated APTC ATEs (≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and 
 
aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively) by PT was cerebrovascular accident (2 patients [0.3%], 3 patients 
[0.5%], and 2 patients [0.3%]). 
Three of the non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related 
to study treatment: ischaemic stroke in the faricimab Q8W arm, lacunar stroke in the faricimab PTI 
arm, and cerebrovascular accident in the aflibercept Q8W arm.

Up to Clinical Cut-Off Date DME indication 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2.2%, 1.9%, and 2.4% of 
patients experienced at least one externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATE in the faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively.  
After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no death adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs across 
all treatment arms; 1 patient (0.2%) with a non-fatal MI adjudicated APTC-defined ATE (cardiogenic 
shock in the faricimab Q8W arm suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment); 
and 1 patient (0.2%) with a non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC-defined ATE (cerebrovascular accident 
in the aflibercept Q8W arm suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment; 
90-Day Safety Update Report 
The 90-Day Safety Update Report (SUR) provided updated cumulative pooled safety data from the 
ongoing Phase III studies for each indication (nAMD and DME/DR) up to the Clinical Cut-Off Date of 09 
April 2021 (i.e., an additional median of 8 months for nAMD and median of 9 months for DME/DR of 
safety data compared to the primary analysis presented in the BLA SCS which supports the initial BLA). 
nAMD indication 
Key pooled safety results provided by the Applicant through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date were as 
follows: 
• The overall incidence of AEs remained comparable between the treatment arms (548/664 patients 
[82.5%] in the faricimab arm and 550/662 patients [83.1%] in the aflibercept arm). 
• The incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date remained 
comparable between the treatment arms (48.0% in the faricimab and 46.5% in the aflibercept arm), 
with an increase of approximately 10 percentage points in the incidence in both arms compared with 
SCS (Week 48). The ocular AEs with ≥1% difference between the treatment arms remained similar to 
those reported in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SCS (Week 48), with the newly added events as of the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date (faricimab arm vs. 
aflibercept arm): cataract (5.7% vs 4.1%) and eye irritation (1.7% vs. 0.6%); 
• The most common ocular AEs in the study eye (≥2% incidence in either treatment arm) by PT were 
generally consistent with the events reported in the SCS (Week 48), with the newly added events 
(faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm): blepharitis (2.3% vs. 2.4%) and posterior capsule opacification 
(2.3% vs 2.1%); 
• The most common treatment-related ocular AEs in the study eye (≥0.5% in either treatment arm) 
were generally consistent with those reported in the SCS (Week 48), with the newly added event of 
uveitis (3 patients [0.5%]) in the faricimab arm. 
• The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off 
Date was higher in the faricimab arm compared with that in the aflibercept arm but was still 
considered low in both treatment arms (3.3% in the faricimab arm and 1.5% in the aflibercept arm; 
The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation remained low in both treatment 
arms (13 patients [2.0%] in the faricimab arm and 5 patients [0.8%] in the aflibercept arm). The 
incidence of IOI events leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the faricimab arm than that 
in the aflibercept arm (5 patients [0.8%] in the faricimab arm and 1 patient [0.2%] in the aflibercept 
arm); 
• The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation remained low (4.7% in the faricimab arm and 
3.5% in the aflibercept arm;The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation was low and 
comparable in both treatment arms (2 patients [0.3%] in the faricimab arm and 3 patients [0.5%] in 
the aflibercept arm). 
• The incidence of ocular AESIs in the study eye remained comparable between the treatment arms 
(13 patients [2.0%] in the faricimab arm and 22 patients [3.3%] in the aflibercept arm); 
• The incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) events remained low and comparable between the 
treatment arms (18 patients [2.7%] in the faricimab arm and 12 patients [1.8%] in the aflibercept 
arm). There were no new IOI events reported as retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in any treatment 
arms; 
• The incidence and nature of non-ocular AEs through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date was generally 
comparable to that reported in the SCS (Week 48) and between the treatment arms (66.1% in the 
faricimab arm and 67.7% in the aflibercept arm); 
• The incidence of serious non-ocular AEs through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date remained comparable 
between treatment arms (15.8% in the faricimab arm and 18.3% in the aflibercept arm)l 
• A total of 34 patients died through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date (2.9% in the faricimab arm and 
2.3% in the aflibercept arm). No deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant also provided preliminary data summary to week 112 from the ongoing nAMD clinical 
studies. 
Overall, based on the pooled safety data from 1326 patients from the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies, 
the safety data indicate that faricimab has a comparable safety profile to aflibercept. In addition, 
faricimab was generally well tolerated as evidenced by the low incidence (less than 5%) of AEs leading 
to treatment withdrawal, and AEs were generally manageable (mainly mild/moderate, non-serious, and 
resolved with or without treatment). The data remains consistent with that observed through the 
primary endpoint analysis at Week 48.  
Key pooled safety results through Week 112 were the following: 
- The incidence of AEs was comparable between the treatment arms (575/664 patients [86.6%] in the 
faricimab arm and 587/662 patients [88.7%] in the aflibercept arm); 
- Through Week 112, the incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye was comparable between the 
treatment arms (358 patients [53.9%] in the faricimab arm and 345 patients [52.1%] in the 
aflibercept arm), with the exception (> 1% difference in any treatment arm: faricimab arm vs. 
aflibercept arm) of cataract (58 patients [8.7%] vs. 50 patients [7.6%]), dry eye (29 patients [4.4%] 
vs. 45 patients [6.8%]), vitreous floaters, (30 patients [4.5%] vs. 17 patients [2.6%]), and retinal 
pigment epithelial tear (19 patients [2.9%] vs. 10 patients [1.5%] ; 
– The majority of cataract events were reported as progression of pre-existing condition and unrelated 
to study treatment or procedure. 
– The events of vitreous floaters were non-serious and mild in severity, except for one severe case in 
each arm. These events of vitreous floaters were not associated with any IOI event. 
– No new retinal pigment epithelial tear events were reported in the faricimab arm since the primary 
analysis (at Week 48). The majority of these events were reported during the loading phase, after 1 - 
4 treatment injections. 
- Through Week 112, the most common ocular AEs in the study eye (> 0.5%) suspected by the 
investigator to be related to faricimab were retinal pigment epithelial tear (8 patients [1.2%]), 
intraocular pressure increased (4 patients [0.6%]), and uveitis (4 patients [0.6%]). The most common 
ocular AE in the study eye (> 0.5%) suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept was 
intraocular pressure increased (4 patients [0.6%]). 
- Through Week 112, the overall incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was low and 
comparable across treatment arms (4.4% in both treatment arms), with the exception (> 0.5% 
difference between treatment arms) of retinal pigment epithelial tear (4 patients [0.6%] in the 
faricimab arm and 0 patients in the aflibercept arm). 
- The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low in both treatment arms (28 
patients [4.2%] in the faricimab arm and 18 patients [2.7%] in the aflibercept arm). The incidence of 
ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through Week 112 was also low (17 patients 
[2.6%] in the faricimab arm and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm), which was 11 more patients 
in the faricimab arm and 7 more patients in the aflibercept arm since the primary analysis (at Week 
48). No pattern was observed in ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation in terms of 
timing and per regimen. The most common ocular AE leading to study treatment discontinuation was 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 9 patients [1.4%] in the 
faricimab arm and 4 patients [0.6%] in the aflibercept arm); 
- All events of worsening of nAMD were assessed as related to the underlying disease (nAMD) or other 
cause in the faricimab arm, and a causal relationship to the study drug was ruled out. One event in the 
aflibercept arm that was assessed related to aflibercept treatment; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation was low in both treatment arms (33 patients 
[5.0%] in the faricimab arm and 35 patients [5.3%] in the aflibercept arm). The incidence of ocular 
AEs leading to study discontinuation through Week 112 was also low (1 patient [0.2%] in the faricimab 
arm and 5 patients [0.8%] in the aflibercept arm). 
- Through Week 112, the incidence of AESIs in the study eye was low and comparable between the 
treatment arms (25 patients [3.8%] in the faricimab arm and 27 patients [4.1%] in the aflibercept 
arm). 
- Through Week 112, the incidence of IOI events in the study eye was low in both treatment arms (20 
patients [3.0%] in the faricimab arm and 15 patients [2.3%] in the aflibercept arm. 
- In total, through Week 112, 44 deaths were reported (23 patients [3.5%] in the faricimab arm and 
21 patients [3.2%]) in the aflibercept arm). None of the deaths were suspected to be related to study 
treatment by investigators. 
- Through Week 112, the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an 
independent clinical coding committee) was low and comparable across treatment arms (3.3% and 
3.0% in the faricimab and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively) and remained as expected in this 
patient population. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DME indication: 
Updated safety data was provided by the applicant in the Safety update report (SUR):  
Key pooled safety results through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled Parent Studies were the 
Following: 
• The incidence of AEs remained generally comparable across all treatment arms (567/630 [90.0%], 
551/632 [87.2%], and 545/625 [87.2%] patients in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept 
Q8W arms, respectively). 
• The incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye was 47.5%, 47.3%, and 43.7% of patients in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively, with an increase of 
approximately 10 percentage points in the incidence in all treatment arms compared with SCS (Week 
56). There were a small number of ocular AEs with ≥2% difference between the faricimab Q8W or PTI 
arms and the aflibercept Q8W arm (faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively): cataract (12.1%, 9.5%, and 9.3%; newly added), dry eye (4.6%, 4.1%, and 2.6%; 
 
 
 
newly added), intraocular pressure increased (4.9%, 3.3%, and 2.6%; newly added), and vitreous 
floaters (5.1%, 2.5%, and 2.7%). 
• The most common ocular AEs in the study eye (≥2% incidence in any treatment arm: faricimab 
Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively) by PT were generally consistent with those 
reported in the SCS (Week 56), with the newly added events: cataract subcapsular (3.0%, 2.2%, and 
1.4%; newly added), diabetic retinal oedema (verbatim, worsening of DME; 1.6%, 2.5%, and 2.2%; 
newly added),conjunctivitis (1.4%, 2.1%, and 1.3%; newly added), cataract nuclear (1.6%, 2.1%, and 
1.3%; newly added), blepharitis (2.4%, 1.4%, and 0.8%; newly added), and diabetic retinopathy 
(verbatim, worsening of DR; 0.6%, 2.1%, and 1.1%; newly added). 
• The most common treatment-related ocular AEs in the study eye (≥0.5% in either of the faricimab 
arms) were consistent with those reported in the SCS (Week 56); ocular hypertension in the faricimab 
PTI arm reported in the SCS (Week 56) no longer met the threshold of ≥0.5% in either of the 
faricimab arms by the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date due to updates in the database. 
• The incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye remained higher in both faricimab arms 
compared with the aflibercept Q8W arm (4.0%, 4.9%, and 2.9% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, 
and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
However, the overall incidence remained low, and there was no consistent pattern observed at the 
individual PT level between the treatment arms. There were two newly added serious ocular AEs with 
≥0.5% difference between any two of the treatment arms; uveitis and retinal tear (0, 3 patients 
[0.5%], and 0 each in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). The 
most common serious ocular AEs in the study eye ( ≥ 2 patients in the combined faricimab arms or 
aflibercept Q8W arm) by PT were generally consistent with those reported in the SCS (Week 56), with 
the newly added events (faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively): 
diabetic retinopathy (verbatim, worsening of DR; 2 patients [0.2%] vs. 3 patients [0.5%]), cataract 
subcapsular (2 patients[0.2%] vs. 2 patients [0.3%]), retinal vein occlusion (3 patients [0.2%] vs. 0), 
posterior capsule opacification (2 patients [0.2%] vs. 0), retinal artery occlusion (1 patient [ <0.1%] 
vs. 2 patients [0.3%]), and visual impairment (2 patients [0.2%] vs. 0); visual acuity reduced 
transiently and ocular hypertension reported in SCS (Week 56) no longer met the threshold of ≥ 2 
patients by the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date due to updates in the database. 
• The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off 
Date remained low (2.4%, 3.2%, and 1.8% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively). The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation remained 
low and generally comparable across all treatment arms (5 patients [0.8%], 12 patients [1.9%], and 2 
patients [0.3%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). No 
pattern was observed in ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation in terms of timing and 
per regimen. 
• The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date remained 
low (4.3%, 4.4%, and 3.7% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively; The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation remained low and 
comparable across treatment arms (4 patients [0.6%], 5 patients [0.8%], and 2 patients [0.3%] in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). No pattern was observed in 
ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation in terms of timing and per regimen. 
• The incidence of ocular AESIs in the study eye remained higher in both faricimab arms than that in 
the aflibercept Q8W arm as of the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date (3.8%, 4.7%, and 2.6% in the faricimab 
Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively). However, the difference in AESIs was 
small and the overall incidence was low for all treatment arms. 
• The incidence of IOI events in the study eye remained low and comparable across all treatment arms 
(9 patients [1.4%], 11 patients [1.7%], and 7 patients [1.1%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, 
and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
• The incidence and nature of non-ocular AEs through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date was generally 
comparable to that reported in the SCS (Week 56) and across all treatment arms (72.4%, 73.1%, and 
73.9% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
The incidence of serious non-ocular AEs remained generally comparable across all treatment arms 
(27.3%, 24.2%, and 25.8% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively). 
• A total of 73 patients died through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date (25 patients [4.0%], 26 patients 
[4.1%], and 22 patients [3.5%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively). No deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
• The incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an independent clinical 
coding committee) through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date remained comparable across treatment arms 
(4.3%, 4.1%, and 4.2% in the faricimab Q8W, and faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively).

Non-Ocular Adverse Events of Special Interest DME indication 
Through Week 56, 1 patient (0.2%) experienced an elevated ALT or AST with either elevated bilirubin 
or clinical jaundice (PT of chronic hepatitis) in the aflibercept Q8W arm, the chronic hepatitis event was 
considered serious, suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment, and resolving 
by the Clinical Cut-Off Date. There were no cases of drug induced liver injuries by the study drug 
reported in the faricimab arms. After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no additional 
non-ocular AESIs. 
2.4.8.4.  Safety in special populations 
nAMD:  safety in special groups 
Intrinsic factors 
Subgroup Analyses were performed to examine key safety across the subgroups defined by the 
following intrinsic factors:  
• Age (< 75, ≥ 75, <85, ≥85)  
• Gender (female and male)  
• Race (White, Asian, and Other)  
• Medical History (renal disease, cardiac disease, and vascular disease)  
Overall, through Week 48, differences in incidences of ocular AEs, incidences of nonocular AEs, 
incidences of SAEs, and incidences of ocular AESIs between the faricimab and aflibercept arms were 
generally consistent across subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, race, and medical history) and with 
incidences between the faricimab and aflibercept arms in the overall safety-evaluable population. 
Subgroup analyses are provided in forest plots (Figures 61 and 62) for ocular AEs in the study eye 
through Week 48; for non-ocular AEs through Week 48; for SAEs through Week 48; and for ocular 
AESIs in the study eye through Week 48.

Intrinsic factors 
Analyses were performed to examine key safety across the subgroups defined by the following intrinsic 
factors: 
•  Baseline DR severity (≤ 53 and > 53); 
•  Baseline HbA1c (≤ 8% and > 8%);

Overall, through Week 56, differences in incidences of ocular AEs, incidences of nonocular AEs, 
incidences of SAEs, and incidences of ocular AESI between each of the faricimab arms and the 
aflibercept Q8W arms were consistent across subgroups (e.g., by: age, gender, race, medical history, 
baseline DR severity, and baseline HbA1c) and with incidences in the overall safety-evaluable 
population.

No subgroup analyses by extrinsic factors were performed. 
The following tables were provided as part of the response to day 120 list of questions: 
In the pooled nAMD data, there were more serious AEs in the oldest age group (> 85 years), with 
increased incidences noted for fatal events, hospitalization, AEs leading to drop out, nervous system 
disorders, accidents and injuries, vascular and cerebrovascular disorders, sum of postural hypotension, 
 
 
falls, black outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, fractures, along with small differences in infections, fall, 
headache, and back pain (Table 65).

by Age Category through Week 60, Safety-Evaluable Population 
In the pooled DME data, there are no obvious differences in AEs across the <85 year age group 
categories, though data in the >74 year categories should be interpreted with caution due to the 
limited number of patients (Table 66).

2.4.8.5.  Immunological events 
nAMD 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients was low (10.4% [68/657 patients] 
in the faricimab arm with a median time to onset of ADA of 20.1 weeks. There was no significant 
impact of ADAs against faricimab observed on overall safety in the nAMD safety population. 
Through Week 48, 75 patients were ADA-positive at any point, of which 7 patients were treatment-
unaffected ADA-positive.  
Through Week 48, with regard to the ADA-positive subgroup, the incidence of SAEs was low (10.7% 
[8/75 patients] in the faricimab arm) with isolated individual events within SOCs and no specific 
pattern identified.  
Of the patients who were ADA-positive and experienced ocular AEs, they were mainly non-serious, 
suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment, and did not result in vision loss of 
greater than 30 letters or study withdrawal.  
Overall the rate of IOI was higher in the ADA-positive subgroup (6.7% [5/75 patients: 3 patients in 
TENAYA and 2 patients in LUCERNE) than in the ADA-negative subgroup (1.2% [7/582 patients: 1 
patient in TENAYA and 6 patients in LUCERNE.  
In the SUR, the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) events remained low and comparable 
between the treatment arms (18 patients [2.7%] in the faricimab arm and 12 patients [1.8%] in the 
aflibercept arm). There were no new IOI events reported as retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in 
any treatment arms. 
Diabetic macular edema  
There was no apparent impact of ADAs against faricimab observed on overall safety. 
Through Week 56, 113 patients were ADA-positive at any point, of which 8 patients were treatment-
unaffected ADA-positive. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients was low and 
comparable across the faricimab treatment arms (8.2% in the faricimab Q8W arm and 8.7% in the 
faricimab PTI arm; with a similar median time to onset of ADA (approximately 28 weeks) 
Through Week 56, with regard to the ADA-positive subgroup, the incidence of patients with SAEs was 
28.1% in the faricimab Q8W arm and 26.8% in the faricimab PTI arm, with isolated individual events 
within SOCs and no pattern identified. Of the patients who were ADA-positive and experienced ocular 
AEs, they were mainly non-serious, suspected by the investigator not to be related to study treatment, 
did not result in vision loss of ≥ 30 letters or study withdrawal, and were not associated with severe 
IOI events 
Overall, the incidence of IOI was higher in the ADA-positive subgroup (9.7%; 11/113): 10 patients in 
YOSEMITE and 1 patient in RHINE than in the ADA-negative subgroup (0.5%; 6/1130): 2 patients in 
YOSEMITE and 4 patients in RHINE.

2.4.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Since faricimab is a monoclonal antibody, no drug-drug interactions are expected via cytochrome 
P450, other metabolizing enzymes, or transporters. Therefore, no formal drug-drug interaction studies 
were conducted for faricimab, which is acceptable (please see PK section of this assessment report). In 
the population PK analysis, IOP lowering drugs did not have any effect on faricimab ocular PK. 
2.4.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
nAMD: AEs that led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment or Study Discontinuation 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 8 patients (1.2%) in the 
faricimab arm and 3 patients (0.5%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one ocular AE that led 
to study treatment discontinuation.  
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation 
by PT were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 2 patients 
[0.3%]) in the faricimab arm; and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening 
of nAMD) and non-infectious endophthalmitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm.  
From baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab arm and 1 patient 
(0.2%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one ocular AE that led to study discontinuation. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation by PT were 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of nAMD; 2 patients [0.3%]) in 
the faricimab arm; and visual acuity reduced (1 patient [0.2%]) in the aflibercept arm.  
 
 
 
Preliminary data to week 112 for the nAMD indication indicates that the overall incidence of AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation was balanced across both treatment groups (28 (4.2%)in the 
faricimab arm and 18 (2.7%)in the aflibercept arm).   
The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation has previously been noted to be 
higher for faricimab and through Week 112, the rate was generally low but higher for faricimab (17 
patients [2.6%] in the faricimab arm and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm). This represents 11 
more patients in the faricimab arm and 7 more patients in the aflibercept arm since week 48 data was 
presented. 
No specific pattern in ocular AEs leading to discontinuation has been noted but to date, the most 
common ocular AE leading to study treatment discontinuation was worsening of nAMD; 9 patients 
[1.4%] in the faricimab arm and 4 patients [0.6%] for aflibercept. 
nAMD: AEs that led to Dose Interruption up to Clinical Cut-Off Date  
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 15 patients (2.3%) in the 
faricimab arm and 9 patients (1.4%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one ocular AE that led 
to dose interruption. After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, the ocular AEs leading to dose 
interruption by PT were blepharitis, vitritis, ophthalmic herpes simplex, and rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and cataract operation complication (1 
patient [0.2%]) in the aflibercept arm. 
Diabetic macular edema 
Ocular Adverse Events that led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment or Study Discontinuation 
Through Week 56-DME indication 
Overall through Week 56, the incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was 
low and comparable across treatment arms (2 patients [0.3%], 8 patients [1.3%], and 2 patients 
[0.3%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively.  
No pattern was observed in ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation in terms of timing 
and per regimen. All patients who discontinued from study treatment due to an ocular AE were 
treatment naive patients.  
The ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation by PT were intraocular pressure increased, 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitritis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab Q8W arm; 
endophthalmitis (2 patients [0.3%]), uveitis (2 patients [0.3%]), allergy to chemicals, diabetic eye 
disease, ocular hypertension, and ulcerative keratitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab PTI arm; 
and endophthalmitis and retinal artery occlusion (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Overall, through Week 56, the incidence of ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation was low and 
comparable across treatment arms (2 patients [0.3%], 2 patients [0.3%], and 1 patient [0.2%] in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). No pattern was observed in 
ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation in terms of timing and per regimen. All patients who 
discontinued from study due to an ocular AE were treatment naive patients.  
The ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation by PT were intraocular pressure increased, 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitritis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab Q8W arm; 
allergy to chemicals and endophthalmitis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab PTI arm; and retinal 
artery occlusion (1 patient [0.2%]) in the aflibercept Q8W arm.

Non-Ocular Adverse Events that led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment or Study 
Discontinuation Through Week 56-DME indication 
Overall through Week 56, incidence of non-ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was 
low and comparable across treatment arms (8 patients [1.3%], 4 patients [0.6%], and 5 patients 
[0.8%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively; No pattern was 
observed in non-ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation in terms of timing, per regimen, 
or previously treated versus treatment naive population.  The non-ocular AEs leading to study 
treatment discontinuation were breast cancer, lung neoplasm malignant, cerebrovascular accident, 
ischaemic stroke, cardiac failure congestive, infectious mononucleosis, renal failure, and peripheral 
artery thrombosis (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab Q8W arm; colon cancer, neoplasm, plasma 
cell myeloma, and myocardial infarction (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab PTI arm; and 
adenocarcinoma, cerebrovascular accident, dementia Alzheimer’s type, spinal cord compression, and 
contrast media allergy (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Overall through Week 56, the incidence of non-ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation was low and 
comparable across treatment arms (14 patients [2.2%], 10 patients [1.6%], and 8 patients [1.3%] in 
the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively; No pattern was observed in 
non-ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation in terms of timing, per regimen, or previously treated 
versus treatment naive population.  
The non-ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation were myocardial infarction, acute myocardial 
infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure congestive, left atrial dilatation, left ventricular dilatation, 
pericarditis, bladder cancer, lung neoplasm malignant, death, general physical health deterioration, 
cerebral haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, sepsis, diabetic complication, and embolism (1 patient 
[0.2%] each) in the faricimab Q8W arm; death (3 patients [0.5%]), cardiac failure (2 patients 
 
 
[0.2%]), myocardial infarction, colon cancer, neoplasm, plasma cell myeloma, and pneumonia 
aspiration (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab PTI arm; and myocardial infarction, acute 
myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, adenocarcinoma, dementia Alzheimer’s type, spinal 
cord compression, contrast media allergy, and completed suicide (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the 
aflibercept Q8W arm. 
Up to Clinical Cut-Off Date-DME indication 
In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 9 patients (1.4%), 4 patients 
(0.6%), and 7 patients (1.1%) experienced at least one non-ocular AE that led to study treatment 
discontinuation in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively

From baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 2.5%, 2.7%, and 2.2% of patients experienced a non-
ocular AE that led to study discontinuation in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W 
arms, respectively.  
Discussion on clinical safety nAMD 
The safety evaluation for the nAMD indication is based primarily on the pooled Phase III nAMD safety 
data from the identical pivotal trials TENAYA and LUCERNE. The primary safety analysis is based on the 
available data up to Week 48. In addition, the applicant has provided data up to Week 60 to the clinical 
cutoff date of 19 January 2021 for TENAYA and 28 December 2020 for LUCERNE. A further update in 
the form of a 90 day Safety Update report (SUR) to April 2021 was provided with the responses and 
preliminary safety data summary to week 112 was also provided subsequently. 
It is highlighted that both pivotal phase III trials in the nAMD indication were ongoing at the time of 
submission of this application and the final safety data remains outstanding at this time, although an 
overview of safety data from the nAMD clinical studies to week 112 was provided as a preliminary 
safety summary. In this context, some uncertainty remains in relation to the overall safety profile of 
faricimab which is considered to be still evolving at this time, although long term safety will be further 
followed in the Long term extension study which has been listed in the RMP. 
This long-term extension (LTE) study for the nAMD indication is currently planned/ongoing but there is 
no safety data available from this study at the time of primary safety analysis. An update on the 
limited data from masked safety data was provided with the responses and while no new safety signals 
were identified from this limited data, the overall absence of longer term data in this indication remains 
a concern The Applicant has therefore agreed to include long term safety as missing information in the 
RMP, which is endorsed. 
nAMD- Patient exposure 
In total, 664 nAMD patients were exposed to faricimab (331 in LUCERNE and 333 in TENAYA) and 662 
patients were exposed to aflibercept (326 in LUCERNE and 336 in TENAYA), the chosen active 
comparator to study treatment in both studies, in their preselected study eye. Median duration of 
exposure was 48.1 weeks for both treatment groups (in pooled and individual studies). 
The overall patient exposure in the nAMD population is considered generally acceptable. However, as 
previously highlighted, both pivotal studies in the nAMD indication are ongoing at the time of 
submission of this application and at the time of the responses to the day 120 list of questions. Also, 
further data on the longer term safety profile of faricimab is still anticipated with the progression of the 
LTE study. This is considered an area of uncertainty as the safety profile of faricimab, whilst generally 
characterised could be considered to be still evolving. 
In the nAMD Phase III (TENAYA/LUCERNE) trials, faricimab patients received a dosing regimen (Q8W, 
Q12W or Q16W) based on their treatment needs, which was determined by an assessment of their 
disease activity status (at weeks 20 and 24) after the initial loading phase. . According to the Clinical 
Overview, 45.3%, 33.4% and 21.2% of patients in the nAMD pooled ITT population were on a fixed 
Q16W, Q12W and Q8W dose regimen at Week 48, respectively. Due to the post randomization patient 
assignment to treatment schedules based on disease activity asseement, all patients treated with 
faricimab are reported as a pooled faricimab arm in the provided clinical summary of safety. 
Considering the new active substance with non-established safety profile for the proposed mode of 
action (dual inhibition of VEGF and Ang2), some uncertainty remains as to whether the number of 
evaluated patients is sufficient to conclude safety for each of the dosing groups also with respect to 
potential rare events, particularly for the most intense 8QW dosing schedule where overall patient 
 
 
numbers were more limited. This issue will need to be followed closely and further data is expected to 
be generated for this dosing regimen in the LTE study. Extrapolation from studies that included 
patients with DME is not expedient due to the distinct disease character with a different profile of 
potential comorbidities (as also described by the applicant) and due to the differening treatment 
schedules that were applied in the clinical program for DME (i.e. personalized treatment intervals with 
dynamic schedule). As noted, the most intense treatment schedule for faricimab, i.e. Q8W, had the 
least patients included (i.e. n=141 patients). The included numbers for the other treatment schedules 
appear rather sparse considering the new mode of action (n=222 for Q12W and n=301 for Q16W). The 
biggest proportion of patients followed Q16W with only two injection events between disease 
assessment (at weeks 20 and 24) and week 48. Additional data analysis is provided for week 60, which 
coincides with the time of the third injection for the Q16W schedule.  
"Uncertainties with regard to the amount of data being collected for each dose regimen" were also 
expressed in the scope of scientific advice. The applicant was reminded during the procedure that 
"there may be insufficient safety data in subsets of patients (e.g. very elderly, cardiovascular risk 
factors) that might warrant additional (post-approval) studies" and "that data collected for the most 
intense Q8W maintenance regimen will be limited to those (possibly few) patients with disease activity 
at week 20".  
In this context, the applicant was asked to further justify the extrapolation from other treatment 
schedules. Safety data up to April 2021 was initially provided in the SUR. Whilst an increased intensity 
of treatment with faricimab (i.e. Q8W regimen) is associated with an increase in risk for ocular AEs 
when compared to the other dosing regimens, it was acknowledged that higher frequency of ocular AEs 
such as procedure-related AEs is likely to occur with more frequent intravitreal administration and the 
likelihood of more severe ocular disease at baseline (by virtue of the study design). The Applicant 
presents pooled data on nAMD phase III studies that indicates an increased ocular risk for subjects 
treated with Q8W faricimab. Nevertheless, there was an increased risk for faricimab (Q8W dosing 
regimen) treated subjects to experience an AE, AESI or serious AE in the study eye (compared to 
aflibercept).Still, it is agreed that the applied study design hinders a direct comparison between both 
treatment options, since patients on faricimab Q8W would have had worse baseline disease, whereas 
the aflibercept Q8W arm included patients with a range of baseline disease severity 
Based on the response provided, the currently available numbers of patients exposed to faricimab in 
the most intense treatment schedule is considered sufficient for an initial marketing authorisation, 
provided that the product information is further strengthened to reflect the safety profile of the 8QW 
dosing regimen for faricimab, and that the safety profile of 8QW dosing of faricimab is further 
discussed and followed as part of the LTE study. 
In relation to the nAMD indication, the Applicant also provided an update through the end of study for 
the two pivotal nAMD studies for patients enrolled into the global enrollment phase (TENAYA last 
patient last visit [LPLV] of 18 January 2022 and LUCERNE LPLV of 07 January 2022) in the form of a 
preliminary safety data summary. 
Provision of these data represents the complete safety data from the 2 year pivotal studies for this 
indication. 
On the basis of the preliminary data provided, no new information has emerged since the data-lock 
point of the Safety Update Report (SUR) from 9 April 2021 for nAMD which would impact on the safety 
profile for faricimab.  
There has not been a change to the list of Important Identified Risks (Infectious Endophthalmitis and 
Intraocular Inflammation) proposed in the initial submission and the Applicant has agreed to add ATE 
and non-ocular haemorrhage as Important Potential Risks as outlined in safety specification in the EU 
RMP Part II Module SVII.1.2 as requested. 
Besides data from the two pivotal studies, safety data from two phase II studies (AVENUE and 
STAIRWAY) are available (AVENUE: n=46 for 1.5mg Q4W, n=39 for 6mg Q4W, n=46 for 6mg Q4W-
Q8W, all faricimab and n=67 for 0.5mg ranibizumab; STAIRWAY: n=24 for 6mg Q12W, n=31 for 6mg 
Q16W, all faricimab and n=16 for 0.5mg ranibizumab Q4W). Data from phase 1 studies is rather 
limited with n=4 nAMD patients included in study JP39844 and n=24 nAMD patients included in study 
BP28936. Importantly, the commercial drug product was only used in the pivotal phase 3 studies, after 
some of the excipients differed as compared to the drug product from previous studies. Due to GCP 
violations at one study site, data from 10 patients was excluded from AVENUE and five patients were 
excluded from STAIRWAY. The depicted reasons for study site closure of the affected location and data 
exclusion can be followed with respect to maintain the integrity of the full data pool. Similarly, 
exclusion of 3 patients from the safety-evaluable population that never received any treatment after 
randomization to the pivotal studies (2 in TENAYA and 1 in LUCERNE) can be followed.  Importantly, in 
TENAYA 52 patients and in LUCERNE 23 patients had optional plasma samples or optional aqueous 
humor samples collected where prior informed consent was either not obtained or withdrawn. These 
were reported as major protocol deviations and all unconsented sample analyses were removed from 
the databases used for reporting. The applicant provided reasons for this issue in both pivotal studies 
and provided an evaluation on the extent of any additional treatment burden and potential safety risk 
that was caused for these patients. Further clarifications were raised in relation to this issue during the 
procedure and it was clarified that no specific safety concerns could be identified for the subgroup of 
patients involved. 
nAMD: Patient Population 
Baseline demographics as well as ocular characteristics in the study eye appear to be balanced across 
treatment arms within the individual phase 3 studies and across the two studies for most of the 
depicted categories. Similarly, no major deviations in distributions were identified for non-ocular 
characteristics, however, the applicant reports an imbalance in patients with >160 systolic or >90 
diastolic blood pressure (11.2% in the faricimab arm vs. 5.2% in the aflibercept arm) in the LUCERNE 
study only. The mean age of pooled data was 75.9 years with the majority of patients (42.8%) in the 
≥75 - <85 year age category (mean age in the faricimab arm was 75.4 years and in the aflibercept 
arm 76.4 years). However, slightly more patients are reported for the aflibercept arm in the ≥85 year 
age category (13.7% in the faricimab arm vs. 19.3% in the aflibercept arm), but slightly less patients 
are reported for the aflibercept arm in the ≥65 - <75 year age category (33.4% in the faricimab arm 
vs. 28.9% in the aflibercept arm). The patient-reported mean (SD) time since AMD diagnosis across 
treatment arms was 1.9 (8.1) months with an imbalance across treatment groups with 2.4 (10.8) and 
1.4 (3.7) mean months since AMD diagnosis for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively. The range 
depicts 0-187 months since diagnosis and 34 unknown cases for the faricimab arm, but only 0-51 
months and 26 unknown cases for the aflibercept arm. The comparable median (0.6 months and 0.7 
months since diagnosis for faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively) as well as depicted categories 
that reflect intervals with different times since nAMD diagnosis, both indicate a more balanced 
distribution than indicated by the mean time since diagnosis. More female patients were included in 
both pivotal studies for both treatment arms (around 60% females and 40% males included). The 
applicant provided further discussion on patient numbers in baseline blood pressure categories (low, 
normal, high) for both studies (see below section on safety in special groups for further discussion in 
this regard). 
Due to the potential to follow a treatment schedule with stretched treatment intervals (depending on 
disease assessment on weeks 20 and 24 after the initial 4 injections in Q4W), the mean and median 
numbers of study drug administrations are lower for faricimab as compared to aflibercept (mean: 6.4 
and 7.4 injection; median 6 and 8 injections, both for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively) with a 
 
fixed Q8W interval (after initial 3 injections in Q4W). In order to decide for the individual need in 
treatment exposure also in clinical practice, the need for disease assessment at weeks 20 and 24 was 
highlighted to inform posology in SmPC. It is also recognised, that the Q8W treatment schedule does 
not reduce the treatment burden compared to the treatment with aflibercept, but rather requires one 
additional exposure for the initial steady state exposure (4 injections in Q4W for faricimab compared to 
3 injections in Q4W for aflibercept).  
All included patients were treated with faricimab only in their dedicated study eye and no data are 
reported on bilateral treatment with faricimab. However, some patients had a diagnosed bilateral 
nAMD and were treated with anti-VEGF standard of care in the fellow eye. The proportion of patients 
with bilateral nAMD can be concluded from the reported treatment for the fellow eye in around 30% of 
included patients (30.9% of the faricimab arm and 27% of the aflibercept arm across studies). 
However, clinical practice foresees bilateral treatment for nAMD and the Applicant was encouraged to 
generate data for bilateral treatment with faricimab. It was clarified that only the availability of 
reassuring data from bilateral use can allow to potentially omit the warning statement in 4.4 of the 
SmPC. Furthermore, a statement regarding potentially increased safety risks following bilateral 
treatment (e.g. due to increased systemic exposure, but also potential bilateral ocular AEs) was added 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect these concerns. The Applicant also confirmed that further safety 
data on bilateral use of faricimab will be generated post-approval specifically in countries where 
faricimab is already approved for this indication. 
 
nAMD: Adverse events 
The overall number of AEs was generally balanced across both pivotal studies in the nAMD indication 
for both faricimab and the comparator aflibercept for ocular AEs, SAEs and non-ocular events at Week 
48.  
The safety profile of faricimab up to week 60 appears principally consistent with the safety profile up to 
week 48. No new or unexpected safety signals are reported for the studies through week 60. In order 
to estimate the long-term occurrence/latency of safety events and the effect of repeated exposure, the 
applicant was asked to list AEs, AESI, SAEs and treatment discontinuations due to AEs reported after 
the week 48 assessment and until the last possible evaluable time point as well as the cumulative pool 
of events until last available time point until answers are provided for both treatment groups and 
considering the different schedules in the faricimab arm. Due to the pooling of distinct treatment 
schedules (Q8W, Q12W and Q16W after disease assessment at weeks 20 and 24), no discrete picture 
of the safety profile was available for each of the applied dose regimens at the initial submission. Upon 
request, the Applicant provided a separate safety analysis (including AEs, AESI, SAEs, ADAs and 
treatment discontinuations due to AEs) for each of the treatment schedules. Based on these data, it 
was noted that patient numbers in the most intense treatment schedule (i.e. Q8W) appear rather low.  
In this context, the Applicant has provided a detailed response to address the question of limitations of 
the safety data for the faricimab Q8W regimen in the nAMD indication. The Applicant states that there 
are no clinically meaningful differences in ocular AEs, AESIs, SAEs between the Q8W faricimab 
subgroup (n=143) and the aflibercept Q8W arm (n=662), as the numerical differences in observed AE 
rates seen between the different faricimab treatment interval subgroups may be confounded by the 
fact that patients with greater baseline disease severity would have had more injections (by virtue of 
the study design). 
The Applicant presented pooled data on nAMD phase III studies that support the view that an 
increased intensity of treatment with faricimab (i.e. higher frequency in dosing) is associated with an 
increase in risk for ocular AEs in the study eye (70/143 patients (49.0%) for Q8W, 92/219 patients 
(42.0%) for Q12W, and 113/289 patients (39.1%) for Q16W), AESIs in the study eye (5/143 patients 
(3.5%) for Q8W, 3/219 patients (1.4%) for Q12W, and 2/289 patients (0.7%) for Q16W) as well as 
serious ocular AEs in the study eye (143 patients (4.9%) for Q8W, 4/219 patients (1.8%) for Q12W, 
and 2/289 patients (0.7%) for Q16W).  
Also, the Applicant presents pooled data on nAMD phase III studies that do indicate an increased 
ocular risk for subjects treated with Q8W faricimab compared to the Q8W aflibercept (49% of subjects 
vs. 40.2% of subjects, respectively). More specifically subjects appear at higher risk to have borderline 
glaucoma, cataract, retinal pigment epithelial tear and vitritis. Furthermore, also an increased risk of 
macular fibrosis, nAMD, posterior capsule opacification and vitreous floaters appears rather evident. 
Still, it is agreed that the applied study design hinders a direct comparison between both treatment 
options, since patients on faricimab Q8W would have had worse baseline disease, whereas the 
aflibercept Q8W arm included patients with a range of baseline disease severity.  
Nevertheless, as part of the Applicant’s response to address this question, they propose to add 
additional wording in section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to strengthen the existing information for HCPs 
in relation to RPE tears. This is endorsed. 
In response to requests from the CHMP, the Applicant appropriately reports in the SmPC that patients 
with increased frequency of injections may be at increased risk of procedural complications. 
In addition, in response to a request from the CHMP during assessment, section 4.2 of the SmPC has 
been updated to reflect that data with the Q8W faricimab regimen is limited at this time. 
The Applicant has also confirmed that additional safety data from patients with nAMD on a faricimab 
Q8W dosing regimen could be provided from the long-term extension study AVONELLE-X, although 
exact patient numbers cannot be confirmed at this time. As also outlined in question 11, the Applicant 
proposes that the safety evaluation of the faricimab Q8W interval can be addressed within the ongoing 
LTE study AVONELLE-X, which is a Category 3 PASS in the proposed EU RMP v1.2 to address the 
missing information of long-term safety. The Final AVONELLE-X CSR is currently planned to be 
available for submission to the Agency by Q1 2025. The overall approach is considered to be 
acceptable but the Applicant has been asked to commit to ensuring that emerging safety data relating 
to this population should be provided regularly through the PSURs.  
In general, the overall safety profile of the treatment of nAMD with faricimab appears to be sufficiently 
characterised to inform the intended population in the SmPC, provided the recommended updates are 
implemented by the Applicant to further strengthen the current wording. Despite the unclear relative 
risk in comparison to aflibercept, the absolute risk can be reflected in the SmPC and treating physicians 
(as well as patients) could opt based on this information for an alternative treatment option, in case 
faricimab does not appear applicable for an individual based on the described risk profile. 
nAMD:Ocular AEs  
A summary of ocular safety is provided below. This is based on the additional data from the 90 day 
Safety Update report (SUR) which was provided with the responses, supported by further preliminary 
safety data to week 112. It is important to highlight that the formal submission of the final data set 
from the ongoing pivotal clinical trials in the nAMD indication is still outstanding at the time of the 
responses but a preliminary overview of available data to week 112 has been provided. Overall, based 
on the pooled safety data from 1326 patients from the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies, the safety data 
indicate that faricimab has a comparable safety profile to aflibercept. In addition, faricimab was 
generally well tolerated as evidenced by the low incidence (less than 5%) of AEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal, and AEs were generally manageable (mainly mild/moderate, non-serious, and resolved 
with or without treatment). The data remains consistent with that observed through the primary 
endpoint analysis at Week 48. 
At the time of primary safety analysis, up to Week 48, there were 254 patients (38.3%) and 246 
patients (37.2%) with ocular AEs for the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively.  
The incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye up to week 112 was generally comparable between the 
treatment arms (358 patients [53.9%] in the faricimab arm and 345 patients [52.1%] for aflibercept. 
There was a > 1% difference in any treatment arm: (faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) of cataract (58 
patients [8.7%] vs. 50 patients [7.6%]), dry eye (29 patients [4.4%] vs. 45 patients [6.8%]), vitreous 
floaters, (30 patients [4.5%], vs 17 patients [2.6%]), and retinal pigment epithelial tear (19 patients 
[2.9%] vs. 10 patients [1.5%]. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for 
total ocular AEs in the study eye up to Week 112 were 68.90 per 100PY for faricimab and 64.02 per 
100 PY for aflibercept. 
In the week 112 preliminary data, the majority of cataract events were reported as progression of pre-
existing condition and unrelated to study treatment or procedure. 
Treatment related ocular AEs: Up to Week 48 there were 19 patients (2.9%) and 17 patients (2.6%) 
with treatment related ocular AEs for the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. Beyond 
Week 48 until the latest available timepoint (SUR), there were a further 7 patients (1.1%) and 2 
patients (0.3%), giving a cumulative total of 3.9% (26/664 patients) for faricimab and 2.9% (19/662 
patients) for aflibercept. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for 
treatment related ocular AEs were 2.85 per 100 PY for faricimab and 1.97 per 100 PY for aflibercept. 
Serious Ocular Adverse Events: Up to Week 48 there were 11 patients (1.7%) and 13 patients (2.0%) 
with serious ocular AEs for the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. Beyond Week 48 
until the latest available timepoint, there were a further 6 patients (0.9%) and 11 patients (1.7%), 
giving a cumulative total of serious ocular AEs 2.6% (17/664 patients) for faricimab and 3.5% (23/662 
patients) for aflibercept.  
As per SUR cut off date, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for serious 
ocular AEs were 2.17 per 100 PY for faricimab and 2.56 per 100 PY for aflibercept. 
Treatment related serious ocular adverse events (1.2% for faricimab and 0.2% for aflibercept at week 
48 report) were noted to have increased in faricimab arm after 90-days observation when compared to 
aflibercept (1.5% for faricimab and 0.3% for aflibercept). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): Up to Week 48 there were 14 patients (2.1%) and 20 
patients (3.0%) with AESIs for the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively. Beyond Week 
48 until the latest available timepoint, there were a further 11 patients (1.7%) and 15 patients (2.3%), 
giving a cumulative total of 3.8% (25/664 patients) for faricimab and 5.0% (33/662 patients) for 
aflibercept.  
The most frequently reported (> 2 events) AESIs of any category being neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (worsening of nAMD), and endophthalmitis. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for study eye AESIs were 1.48 per 
100 PY for faricimab and 2.36 per 100 PY for aflibercept. 
In the preliminary Week 112, the incidence of AESIs in the study eye was low and comparable between 
the treatment arms (25 patients [3.8%] in the faricimab arm and 27 patients [4.1%] in the aflibercept 
arm). 
The incidence of IOI events in the study eye was low in both treatment arms (20 patients [3.0%] in 
the faricimab arm and 15 patients [2.3%] in the aflibercept arm. 
Five ocular AEs of endophthalmitis were reported through Week 112 (3 patients [0.5%] in the 
faricimab arm and 2 patients [0.3%] in the aflibercept arm). All events were assessed as serious. Two 
cases were considered to be related to faricimab treatment; one of which resulted in discontinuation of 
study treatment. All events except one case in the aflibercept arm resolved. This event resulted in 
withdrawal of aflibercept treatment, and the event was considered related to procedure. 
Sight-threatening AESIs: There were 15 sight-threatening AESIs that were not resolved at the time of 
the Week 48 Clinical Cut-Off Date, a total of 7 remained unresolved (5 faricimab and 2 aflibercept) and 
8 were resolved or resolving (6 faricimab and 2 aflibercept) by the 90- Day Safety Update Report 
(SUR) Clinical Cut-Off Date (9 April 2021). The events that remained unresolved at the time of the SUR 
Clinical Cut-Off Date included vitreous haemorrhage, retinal vein occlusion, macular degeneration, and 
2 events of RPE tear (faricimab); and subretinal fibrosis, neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (aflibercept). 
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: up to Week 48 there were 11/664 patients (1.7%) and 4/662 
patients (0.6%) with AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation for the pooled faricimab and 
aflibercept arms, respectively. Beyond Week 48 until the latest available timepoint (SUR), there were a 
further 11 patients (1.7%) and 6 patients (0.9%), giving a cumulative total of 3.3% (22/664 patients) 
for faricimab and 1.5% (10/662 patients) for aflibercept. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for treatment discontinuations due to 
Adverse Events were higher for faricimab at 2.17 per 100 PY and 1.18 per 100 PY for aflibercept. 
In the 90-day safety update report, more subjects withdrew from study treatment when treated with 
faricimab compared to aflibercept due to ocular adverse events (2% for faricimab and 0.8% for 
aflibercept in pooled phase 3 nAMD studies). 
RPE Tears: At Week 48, there was a ≥1% difference in the faricimab treatment arm vs. aflibercept 
arm) for retinal pigment epithelial tear (19 patients [2.9%] vs. 9 patients [1.4%]). These events were 
mostly reported as either mild or moderate in severity. There were 5 patients in the faricimab arm and 
1 patient in the aflibercept arm with a retinal pigment epithelial tear event in the study eye associated 
with vision loss ≥15 letters (4 patients in the faricimab arm and 1 patient in the aflibercept arm with 
vision loss ≥15 letters; and 1 patient with vision loss ≥ 30 letters in the faricimab arm. Based on 
updated SUR, the overall exposure adjusted incidence of RPE tears were slightly higher for faricimab at 
1.87 per 100 PY versus 0.98 per 100 PY for aflibercept. Four patients were reported with serious 
events of retinal pigment epithelial tear in the study eye for the pooled faricimab treatment group 
(Q8W, Q12W and Q16W) through Week 48 in the initial data submission. No event was reported for 
aflibercept.In the preliminary safety data to week 112 for retinal pigment epithelial tear (19 patients 
[2.9%] vs. 10 patients [1.5%] were reported. No new/additional retinal pigment epithelial tear events 
were reported in the faricimab arm. The majority of these events were previously reported during the 
loading phase, after 1 - 4 treatment injections.  
Vitreous floaters: Through the 90-Day Safety Update Report (SUR) clinical cutoff date (Clinical Cut-Off 
Date), the incidence of vitreous floaters in the study eye was 3.8% (25 patients) in faricimab arm and 
2.1% (14 patients) in aflibercept arm. All events of vitreous floaters were reported as non-serious and 
mild in severity, with the exception of one patient in the aflibercept arm experiencing severe (but not 
serious) vitreous floaters. 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for vitreous floaters events based on cumulative data available 
to the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date of 9 April 2021, was slightly higher for faricimab at 2.66 per 100 PYs 
for faricimab and 1.77 per 100 PY for aflibercept. The events of vitreous floaters reported in the 
preliminary week 112 data overview (30 patients [4.5%] vs. 17 patients [2.6%]), were non-serious 
and mild in severity, except for one severe case in each arm. These events of vitreous floaters were 
not associated with any IOI event. 
IOP increase AEs: Using the 90-Day Safety Update Report (SUR) clinical cutoff date (Clinical Cut-Off 
Date) of 9 April 2021, IOP increase adverse events were reported in 25 patients (3.8%) and 24 
patients (3.6%), and ocular hypertension adverse events were reported in 9 patients (1.4%) and 5 
patients (0.8%) in faricimab and aflibercept arms. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for IOP 
increase ocular AEs in the study eye based on cumulative data available from baseline to SUR Clinical 
Cut-Off Date is 3.35 per 100 PY for faricimab and 3.25 per 100 PY for aflibercept. Ocular hypertension 
is less than 1 per 100 PY for both faricimab and aflibercept. 
In terms of ocular safety in the nAMD population, there are some parameters where reports of ocular 
AEs and rates of discontinuation are numerically higher for faricimab when compared to aflibercept. 
However, this picture is not consistent across all currently available cumulative safety data for 
faricimab. As can be seen from the currently available cumulative data above, incidences of certain AEs 
were also higher in the aflibercept population when compared to faricimab.  
Whilst the preliminary data to week 112 has been provided for faricimab in this indication, it is 
highlighted that the formal submission of the full safety data from the nAMD clinical trials is still 
anticipated. Long term safety data for faricimab will be further followed through the LTE which is listed 
in the RMP.  
Through Week 112, the overall incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was low and 
comparable across treatment arms (4.4% in both treatment arms), with the exception (> 0.5% 
difference between treatment arms) of retinal pigment epithelial tear (4 patients [0.6%] in the 
faricimab arm and 0 patients in the aflibercept arm). 
From the provided 90-day safety update report it was noted that more subjects withdrew from study 
treatment when treated with faricimab compared to aflibercept due to ocular adverse events (2% for 
faricimab and 0.8% for aflibercept in pooled phase 3 nAMD studies). However, as indicated above, an 
overall imbalance in favour of aflibercept was not consistently demonstrated in the currently available 
safety data in the nAMD population. 
Adjudicated APTC events: In the Phase III LUCERNE (GR40844) Study through Week 48, there was a 
small imbalance in cases reported as adjudicated APTC events in the faricimab treatment group (n=4, 
1.2%) compared to aflibercept (n=3, 0.9%) but the numbers are small. The number of adjudicated 
APTC events reported in TENAYA was the same for both faricimab and aflibercept (n=3, 0.9%) for both 
treatment arms. Additional clarification was requested in relation to these APTC events.  
The preliminary safety data from Week 112, showed that the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-
defined ATEs (adjudicated by an independent clinical coding committee) was low and comparable 
across treatment arms (3.3% and 3.0% in the faricimab and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively).The 
Applicant submitted a 90 day Safety update report (SUR) with DLP of April 2021 with their responses. 
The applicant clarified that the overall cumulative rate of APTC events is generally balanced between 
both treatments at the time of the 90 day SUR. Longer term safety data and the final dataset from the 
pivotal clinical trials in nAMD is still outstanding however but will be followed closely through the LTE 
study. 
In order to provide a further update on the safety data for the nAMD population in the pivotal clinical 
studies for faricimab, the applicant presented an overview of safety data in a Safety Update Report 
(SUR) until the DLP of April 2021 and compared this to the original safety data from week 48. 
The available data in the SUR comparing an overview of safety Through Week 48 and SUR from the 
Pooled Phase III nAMD Studies shows that the total numbers of patients with at least one AE and 
patients experiencing an SAE are similar between the faricimab and aflibercept treatment groups (and 
slightly higher in the aflibercept treatment arm). 
The total number of fatal cases reported is noted to be similar but numerically higher in the faricimab 
treatment group (n=19;2.9% versus n=15;2.3%). 
More patients withdrew from the studies due to AEs in the faricimab treatment group (n=31;4.7% 
versus n=23; 3.5% for aflibercept).  
Fewer patients in the faricimab nAMD population experienced at least one AESI (n=25;3.8% versus 
n=33; 5.0% for aflibercept). 
The overall rate of ocular AEs was similar between both faricimab and aflibercept treatment groups 
(n=319;48% versus n=308;46.5%) but noted to be slightly higher in the faricimab group.  
Fewer patients treated with faricimab were reported as having an ocular SAE (n=17;2.6% versus 
n=23; 3.5% for aflibercept). Although the number of treatment-related serious ocular AEs (n=10; 
1.5% versus n=2;0.3%) and withdrawals due to ocular AEs was higher for faricimab (n=13; 2.0% 
versus n=5; 0.8% for aflibercept). 
Ocular events of special interest were numerically higher in the aflibercept treatment groups (n=13; 
2.0% faricimab versus n=22; 3.3 for aflibercept). 
In the SUR, the overall rate of non-ocular AEs was generally balanced between both the faricimab and 
aflibercept treatment groups and slightly higher for aflibercept (n=439; 66.1% for faricimab versus 
n=448; 67.7% for aflibercept). Non-ocular SAEs were higher in the aflibercept treatment group 
compared with faricimab (n=105; 15.8% versus n=121; 18.3% for aflibercept).  
The overall rate of adjudicated APTC events was the same for both groups (n=14; 2.1% for each 
group). 
On the basis of the available updated presented to DLP April 2021, supported by the preliminary 
overview for safety through to week 112, it is agreed that the safety profile of faricimab in the SUR is 
generally consistent with that presented in the SCS (Week 48 and Week 60 for nAMD), and remains 
broadly comparable to aflibercept.  
It is highlighted that the total number of withdrawals due to AEs are higher for faricimab versus 
aflibercept when compared with the earlier week 48 data (1.2% versus 1.5% at week 48 compared to 
4.7% faricimab versus 3.5% aflibercept in the SUR). The rate of withdrawals due to ocular AEs is also 
noted to have risen for faricimab over time when compared to aflibercept (0.9% faricimab versus 0.2% 
aflibercept at week 48 compared to 2.0% faricimab versus 0.8% aflibercept in the SUR).  
Through Week 112, the incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low in both 
treatment arms (28 patients [4.2%] in the faricimab arm and 18 patients [2.7%] in the aflibercept 
arm). The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through Week 112 was 
also low (17 patients [2.6%] in the faricimab arm and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm), which 
was 11 more patients in the faricimab arm and 7 more patients in the aflibercept arm since the 
primary analysis (at Week 48). No pattern was observed in ocular AEs leading to study treatment 
discontinuation in terms of timing and per regimen. The most common ocular AE leading to study 
treatment discontinuation was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of 
nAMD; 9 patients [1.4%] in the faricimab arm and 4 patients [0.6%] in the aflibercept arm). 
The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation was low in both treatment arms (33 patients 
[5.0%] in the faricimab arm and 35 patients [5.3%] in the aflibercept arm). The incidence of ocular 
AEs leading to study discontinuation through Week 112 was also low (1 patient [0.2%] in the faricimab 
arm and 5 patients [0.8%] in the aflibercept arm). 
In general, the safety profile of faricimab in the nAMD indication can be considered to be sufficiently 
characterised noting that there is an absence of longer-term safety data for faricimab. This is reflected 
in the RMP. It is recommended the evolving safety profile of faricimab should continue to be closely 
monitored. The updated safety data should continue to be presented as data emerges, especially 
considering the status of faricimab as a new active substance with new mode of action. The applicant 
has committed to closely following the ongoing safety of faricimab in the LTE study and will provide 
regular updates on safety in the PSUR.  
nAMD:Ocular Selected Adverse Events Intraocular Inflammation Events through Week 48  
Intraocular inflammation (IOI) events are a topic of special interest. The overall rate of IOI in the study 
eye was low in general and while broadly comparable between the treatment arms (13 patients [2.0%] 
in the faricimab arm and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm), it is noted that there was a trend 
towards a slightly higher incidence of IOI in the faricimab treatment group. 
Through Week 48, the per-injection rate of IOI events in the study eye was 0.38% in the faricimab 
arm and 0.18% in the aflibercept arm.  
It is also noted that this trend towards a numerically higher rate of IOI continued past Week 48 as the 
cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date indicates that at least one IOI event was 
reported in 2.3% of patients in the faricimab arm and 1.5% in the aflibercept arm. 
While the majority of IOI events in the study eye were mild or moderate in severity in the faricimab 
and aflibercept arms, through Week 48, 3 patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 1 patient (0.2%) 
in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one severe IOI event in the study eye. The IOI events 
reported past Week 48 have been mild-moderate in intensity with no severe events reported to date. 
There were no IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in any treatment arms 
based on currently available data at the time of submission.  
In view of the importance of IOI events, the applicant was asked to present a comparative overview of 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates for IOI events based on the totality of the cumulative data available 
from baseline to currently available safety available since data DLP.  
In the Safety update report (SUR), the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) events remained low 
and comparable between the treatment arms (18 patients [2.7%] in the faricimab arm and 12 patients 
[1.8%] in the aflibercept arm). There were no new IOI events reported as retinal vasculitis or occlusive 
disease in any treatment arms.  
In the preliminary overview of safety through Week 112, the incidence of IOI events in the study eye 
was low in both treatment arms (20 patients [3.0%] in the faricimab arm and 15 patients [2.3%] in 
the aflibercept arm. 
 Five ocular AEs of endophthalmitis were reported through Week 112 (3 patients [0.5%] in the 
faricimab arm and 2 patients [0.3%] in the aflibercept arm). All events were assessed as serious. Two 
cases were considered to be related to faricimab treatment; one of which resulted in discontinuation of 
study treatment. All events except one case in the aflibercept arm resolved. This event resulted in 
withdrawal of aflibercept treatment, and the event was considered related to procedure. 
Long term immunogenicity data for faricimab is considered an area of missing information which 
requires close monitoring going forward. The SmPC should also be further strengthened as 
recommended in the LoOI. 
nAMD:Retinal Vascular Occlusive Disease  
There was one case of retinal artery embolism reported with faricimab.  
After Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there were no additional retinal vascular occlusive disease 
AEs in the study eye. 
nAMD:Intraocular Pressure Mean  
The safety data relating to IOP increased AE in the study eye showed that the overall rate of IOP 
increased was the same for patients in both the faricimab and aflibercept treatment groups (n= 18 
patients (2.7%) in each treatment arm).   
One case of IOP increased AEs in the faricimab arm was considered serious but had resolved by the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date. 
Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 4 patients (0.6%) in the faricimab arm and 5 patients (0.8%) in the 
aflibercept arm developed ocular hypertension in the study eye. An update on the cumulative data in 
respect of IOP increased was provided as part of the request to provide exposure-adjusted incidence 
rates for ocular AEs, AESIs based on the totality of the currently available data, as outlined above. 
As of clinical cut-off point, the number of patients developing new or worsened cataracts and the 
distribution of cataract by grade was generally similar between the faricimab and aflibercept treatment 
groups. 
nAMD:Retinal Break or Detachment  
The number of patients found to have a post-baseline retinal break or retinal detachment in the study 
eye were low and similar between the faricimab and aflibercept treatment groups based on cumulative 
available data. 
nAMD:Non-Ocular AEs 
The overall rates of non-ocular AEs both non-serious and serious are comparable between faricimab 
and aflibercept treatment arms, the overall rates reported are generally numerically higher in the 
aflibercept treatment group. 
The incidence of non-ocular AEs through week 48 was comparable between the treatment arms 
(52.1% in the faricimab arm and 54.8% in the aflibercept arm), with the exception (≥1% difference in 
any treatment arms: faricimab arm vs. aflibercept arm) of hypertension (3.6% vs. 2.4%), arthralgia 
(3.0% vs. 1.7%), fall (1.8% vs. 2.9%), bronchitis (2.6% vs. 1.4%), blood pressure increased (0.2% 
vs. 1.2%), and dyspnea (0.2% vs. 1.2%). 
The incidence of serious non-ocular AEs through week 48 was comparable between the treatment arms 
(10.2% in the faricimab arm and 12.4% in the aflibercept arm). 
It is noted that the pivotal studies were ongoing at the time of submission of this application. The 
applicant therefore provided an overview of available safety data up to week 60 and clinical cut off 
point in the nAMD indication and further data is provided in the 90 day SUR provided with the 
responses.  
The incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an independent clinical 
coding committee) was low and comparable between the treatment arms (7 patients [1.1%] in the 
faricimab arm and 6 patients [0.9%] in the aflibercept arm) at the time of primary analysis at week 
48. 
In addition, it is noted that there was a trend towards a higher number of fatal cases of adjudicated 
APTC events reported following treatment with faricimab at week 60 compared with the aflibercept 
treatment group, with the number of fatal cases reported increasing by 5 for faricimab (n=2 or 0.3% 
at 48 weeks increasing to n=7 or 1.1% at week 60 for faricimab) versus (n=3 or 0.5% at week 48 for 
aflibercept increasing to n=5 or 0.8% at week 60).  
It is noted that a number of APTC events were reported for faricimab in the Phase II clinical studies but 
these were not included in the analysis of APTC events which has been justified by the applicant during 
the procedure. 
The applicant provided a cumulative overview of non-fatal and fatal cases of adjudicated APTC events 
for both treatment groups and presented the exposure adjusted incidence rates for APTC events 
(including non fatal events).  
There was an imbalance between the total number of fatal cases reported for faricimab through to 
week 60 when compared to aflibercept (faricimab=12 versus aflibercept= 8). A complete listing of total 
numbers of fatal cases for both treatment groups was presented, including number of treatments 
administered and detailed causality assessment for any additional fatal cases reported since DLP (see 
also previous discussion on Fatal cases for DME and nAMD indications). In the SUR, no imbalances in 
adjudicated APTC events was noted between faricimab and aflibercept. Through Week 112, the 
incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs was low and comparable across treatment arms 
(3.3% and 3.0% in the faricimab and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
This topic requires close monitoring and an update should be provided on any new safety data of 
relevance which emerges from the ongoing clinical trials. The applicant has agreed to add ATE events 
to the RMP which is endorsed. 
nAMD: Fatal cases 
In total, through Week 48, death was reported in 17 patients (9 patients [1.4%] in the faricimab arm 
and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm). The most common primary cause of death (greater than 
2 patients in any treatment arm) was cardiac failure (2 patients [25.0%], both in the aflibercept arm). 
None of the deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
After Week 48 to the Clinical cut-off point, death was reported in an additional 4 patients (2 patients in 
each treatment arm). The primary cause of death after Week 48 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date were 
pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure (1 patient [50.0%] each) in the faricimab arm; and bile duct 
cancer and pulmonary embolism (1 patient [50.0%] each) in the aflibercept arm.  
As previously noted, the pivotal studies were ongoing at the time of submission of this application. The 
applicant therefore provided an overview of available safety data up to week 60 and clinical cut off 
point in the nAMD indication and further data was provided in the 90 day SUR provided with the 
responses and further preliminary data to week 112 from the clinical studies which were ongoing. 
In addition, in relation to fatal cases arising from APTC events, it is been previously noted that there 
was a trend towards a higher number of fatal cases of adjudicated APTC events reported following 
treatment with faricimab at week 60 compared with the aflibercept treatment group, with the number 
of fatal cases reported increasing by 5 for faricimab (n=2 or 0.3% at 40 weeks increasing to n=7 or 
1.1% at week 60 for faricimab) versus 2 for aflibercept (n=3 or 0.5% at week 40 for aflibercept 
increasing to n=5 or 0.8% at week 60).  These findings and any updated results from ongoing clinical 
studies were further discussed by the applicant. Due to the overall imbalance in fatal cases in the 
safety data for some studies in the nAMD population (to a lesser extent compared to DME population), 
this issue was further addressed as part of the previous MO on clinical safety relating to imbalances in 
overall fatal reports and unexplained deaths with faricimab-please see detailed discussion of this topic 
for further background. 
The reported total number of deaths was 9 cases (1.4%) at week 48, rising to 12 cases (1.8%) at 
week 60 for faricimab and stable 8 cases (1.2%) at week 48 and week 60 for aflibercept in pivotal 
nAMD studies. Fatal cases arising from APTC events were reported with 5 additional cases between 
week 48 and week 60 in the faricimab group (n=2 or 0.3% at 48 weeks increasing to n=7 or 1.1% at 
week 60 for faricimab) and two additional cases in the aflibercept group in the same time (n=3 or 
0.5% at week 48 for aflibercept increasing to n=5 or 0.8% at week 60).  
The Applicant clarified why the total number of reported deaths in the faricimab group increased by 
only 3 cases between week 48 and week 60, despite the 5 additional fatal cases reported for APTC 
related events already, these cases had already been assessed as part of the initial evaluation. 
Similarly, the total number of deaths in the aflibercept group remains stable between week 48 and 
week 60, despite 2 additional fatal cases reported for APTC related events.  
A total of 34 patients died through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date (2.9% in the faricimab arm and 2.3% 
in the aflibercept arm). No deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
In terms of overall fatal reports, a total of 34 patients died through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date 
(2.9% in the faricimab arm and 2.3% in the aflibercept arm). No deaths were suspected by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment.  
In total, through Week 112, 44 deaths were reported (23 patients [3.5%] in the faricimab arm and 21 
patients [3.2%]) in the aflibercept arm). None of the deaths were suspected to be related to study 
treatment by investigators in the preliminary overview of safety data submitted in advance of the 
formal submission of the final CSRs. 
 
nAMD : Serious Ocular AEs  
The number of serious ocular AEs occurring in the evaluable safety population was low and similar 
between both treatment groups. A slightly higher number of serious ocular AEs were reported in the 
aflibercept treatment group (2.0%, n=13) compared to the faricimab arm (1.7%, n=11). 
In the faricimab treatment arm, n=2 patients reported a serious ocular event of worsening of nAMD 
compared to n=3 for aflibercept. 
Serious ocular AEs in the study eye that were suspected to be related to study treatment by the 
investigator are reported for 8 patients (1.2%) in the faricimab arm (2 cases of uveitis, 2 cases of 
vitritis and 4 cases of retinal pigment epithelial tear), but only for 1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept 
arm (1 case of vitritis). Importantly, none of the serious retinal pigment epithelial tear events had 
resolved by Week 48 and one event of uveitis did not resolve. 
There were 2 cases reporting uveitis in the faricimab arm versus 1 case in the aflibercept arm. 2 cases 
of viral uveitis were also reported in the faricimab arm with none reported in the aflibercept arm.  
The Applicant discussed whether the increased load of protein and/or the additional mode of action 
(i.e. anti-Ang2) compared to aflibercept might be responsible for the increased occurrence in treatment 
related serious ocular AEs in the study eye for patients treated with faricimab. Despite further 
discussion in this aspect, it remains unclear whether increased incidences of serious ocular AEs in the 
study as compared to aflibercept are related to protein content and/or the mechanism of action 
(including the novel mechanism of Ang-2 inhibition, besides distinct mechanisms of VEGF inhibition 
between faricimab and aflibercept). It is recognised that the imbalance in treatment related serious 
ocular adverse events (1.2% for faricimab and 0.2% for aflibercept at week 48 report) became more 
pronounced after 90-days observation (1.5% for faricimab and 0.3% after aflibercept). However, on 
the basis of the preliminary safety data through Week 112, it is noted that the overall incidence of 
serious ocular AEs in the study eye was balanced across treatment arms (4.4% in both treatment 
arms), with the exception (> 0.5% difference between treatment arms) of retinal pigment epithelial 
tear (4 patients [0.6%] in the faricimab arm and 0 patients in the aflibercept arm). 
nAMD:  safety in special groups 
The applicant provided subgroup analyses across the various subgroups as outlined-by age, gender, 
race and medical history. 
On the basis of the initial data presented, no major differences were noted across the subgroups 
presented. 
In the Safety Update report, the Applicant reports the requested patient numbers according to baseline 
blood pressure categories (low: <90/60, normal: ≥90/60 to 139/89 to include high normal, high: 
≥140/90) and provides forest plots for subgroup analyses (baseline blood pressure, age categories, 
gender and time since nAMD diagnosis) on ocular AEs in the study eye. The Applicant concludes that 
no imbalances were observed across treatment groups in the incidences of ocular AEs, ocular SAEs, 
non-ocular AEs, and non-ocular SAEs. With respect to provided forest plots it is agreed that no clear 
negative impact (i.e. more AEs reported) of study treatment is concluded for any of the analysed 
subgroups with respect to non-ocular AEs, serious non ocular AEs, ocular AEs in the study eye and 
serious ocular AEs in the study eye in comparison to the comparator treatment (aflibercept). However, 
it is unclear whether results are compromised by the pooling of less intense treatment schedules in the 
 
 
faricimab arm (i.e. Q16W and Q12W pooled with the Q8W treatment schedule), compared to the 
aflibercept arm that maintained all subjects in the most intense treatment schedule. 
Patient numbers for the Q8W treatment schedule in the faricimab arm are low (i.e. n=143 subjects for 
pooled Phase 3 studies TENAYA and LUCERNE) and it is unclear whether any subgroup analyses are 
meaningful. Thus, the Applicant was asked to elaborate on the safety profile of subgroups (especially 
baseline blood pressure and age are of interest) that were followed in the Q8W faricimab treatment 
schedule. The Applicant provided a response outlining that in the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies 
through Week 60, pooled mean and median age were balanced across treatment interval subgroups 
and aflibercept. The maximum age in the faricimab Q8W subgroup (91 years) was lower than the 
faricimab Q12W (99 years) and faricimab Q16W (98 years) subgroups and the aflibercept Q8W (95 
years) arm, which corresponds to slightly fewer > 85 year olds in the faricimab Q8W subgroup (9.1%) 
compared to the Q12W and Q16W subgroups and aflibercept arm (13.2%, 14.9%, and 19.3%, 
respectively. Within the individual nAMD studies, the mean and median age in the Q8W subgroup in 
TENAYA (73.3 years and 74.5 years, respectively) were slightly lower than the other faricimab 
treatment subgroups and aflibercept arm (range: 76.2-76.7 years and 76.0-78.0 years, respectively), 
with a maximum age of 88 years versus 95-99 years (range). LUCERNE was balanced across the 
faricimab subgroups and aflibercept arm, both in mean, median, and maximum age. 
Of note, there are some differences within the treatment interval subgroups with respect to region. 
While a conclusion may not definitively be made, this may have an influence on the general reporting 
of AEs in different regions along with unknowns around the impact of the pandemic in each region, as 
regions may have been impacted at different times (e.g., lockdown, restrictions, access to general 
healthcare, etc.), and continues to do so in some areas. 
Overall, more than half of patients in TENAYA were located in the United States compared to the 
LUCERNE study of which more than half were Rest of World/Asia. 
Within the individual treatment subgroups, nearly half of patients in the LUCERNE faricimab Q8W were 
from the United States, which is similar to TENAYA. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was balanced 
across subgroups and studies at baseline. High blood pressure at baseline was slightly higher in the 
faricimab treatment subgroups compared to the aflibercept arm and was balanced across the 
treatment interval subgroups. The difference was more pronounced between faricimab and aflibercept 
in LUCERNE, but balanced across both treatment intervals and arms in TENAYA. The Applicant 
discusses baseline data regarding age and high blood pressure in studies TENAYA and LUCERNE. It is 
noted that the request was intended to address the safety profile of subgroups within the Q8W 
treatment schedule. However, it is agreed that any post-hoc analysis regarding AEs in subgroups 
would suffer from compromised validity due to the low amount of subjects and AEs. 
The Applicant has generally outlined that there were fewer > 85 year olds in the faricimab Q8W 
subgroup (9.1%) compared to the Q12W and Q16W subgroups and aflibercept arm (13.2%, 14.9%, 
and 19.3%). 
For the pivotal nAMD study TENAYA, the mean and median ages were lower in the Q8W subgroup in 
(73.3 years and 74.5 years, respectively) when compared to the other faricimab treatment subgroups 
and aflibercept arm (range: 76.2-76.7 years and 76.0-78.0 years, respectively). Nevertheless, the 
maximum age of was still 88 years when compared to higher range of 95-99 years for the other 
subgroups.  
There were no imbalances in the other pivotal nAMD study LUCERNE in relation to age across faricimab 
subgroups and aflibercept arm.  
The Applicant also highlights that there were some demographic differences across the pivotal nAMD 
studies whereby >50% of patients in TENAYA were located in the United States whereas in LUCERNE, 
 
more than half of patients were from the Rest of World/Asia. Within the individual treatment 
subgroups, nearly half of patients in the LUCERNE faricimab Q8W were from the United States, which 
is similar to TENAYA. The Applicant highlights that, particularly in the context of the global pandemic, 
this could have had some impact on issues such as reporting and access to general healthcare, but no 
firm conclusions can be made on the basis of the data presented. 
Overall, there were no major imbalances in systolic and diastolic blood pressure across the nAMD 
pivotal studies, although the number of patients with high blood pressure at baseline was slightly 
higher in the faricimab treatment subgroups compared to the aflibercept arm.  
On the basis of the limited discussion presented, it is difficult to draw any further robust conclusions in 
relation to the overall safety of the faricimab Q8W dosing regimen, nevertheless, the Applicant has 
provided a detailed response to address the question of limitations of the safety data for the faricimab 
Q8W regimen in the nAMD indication in their responses. Strengthening of the SmPC is recommended in 
relation to this topic and the Applicant has also confirmed that additional safety data from patients with 
nAMD on a faricimab Q8W dosing regimen could be provided from the long-term extension study, 
AVONELLE-X. 
The Applicant is also asked to commit to ensuring that emerging safety data relating to this population 
should be provided regularly through the PSURs. 
nAMD:  Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Faricimab has not been studied in pregnant women. It is not known whether faricimab can cross the 
placenta or cause harm to the fetus when administered to pregnant women.  
There were no pregnancies reported in the TENAYA or LUCERNE studies; however, a total of two 
pregnancies were reported in the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies. In view of the potential teratogenicity 
of faricimab due to its pharmacological effects, as outlined in section 5.3 of the proposed SmPC, and 
given the status of faricimab as a new active substance with novel mode of action (and potential for 
exposure to women of child-bearing potential in the DME indication especially), the Applicant was 
requested to update the RMP to include pregnancy under ‘missing information’.  An updated RMP was 
submitted with the responses to reflect this concern. 
nAMD: Immunological events 
Anti-drug antibodies were analysed for patients treated with faricimab only, no data were generated 
for patients treated with aflibercept in pivotal studies or ranibizumab in the previous clinical phase 1/2 
program. The incidence of treatment emergent ADAs was 10.4% (68 of 657 evaluated patients) in 
nAMD studies and an additional 1.8% of patients had ADAs at baseline (in total 75 patients with 
ADAs). The risk analysis provided by the applicant concludes no meaningful impact of ADA on overall 
safety. Still, ADA-positive patients had a higher incidence in events of intra-ocular inflammation (6.7% 
of ADA-positive patients and only 1.2% of ADA-negative patients). A comparable pattern was also seen 
in the clinical program on DME. Around 10% of patients (113 ADA-positive patients and 1130 ADA-
negative patients) developed ADAs upon exposure to faricimab and within this subgroup of ADA-
positive patients 9.7% had an event of intra-ocular inflammation. In contrast, only 0.5% of patients 
had intra-ocular inflammation in the ADA-negative group. The rate of treatment-induced ADA 
formation in the population treated with faricimab from pivotal studies is also in line with data from 
phase 2 studies AVENUE (11.3% of patients) and STAIRWAY (10.9% of patients). The general 
incidence of IOI in the study eye (independent of ADA status) was 2% for patients treated with 
faricimab and 1.2% for patients treated with aflibercept in pivotal studies on nAMD. These data 
suggest, that faricimab induces ADA formation in approximately 10% of treated patients and that 
these ADAs are increasing the chance of IOI. It is agreed with the applicant that a direct comparison of 
the observed incidences of treatment-induced ADAs to other products (e.g. anti-VEGF agents) might 
be misleading, due to differences in sample handling and assays used for detection. Still, no other 
comparison is possible after no ADA status was tested for patients in the comparator arm. Within the 
clinical program for aflibercept (as described in the EPAR of Eylea) treatment emergent ADAs were 
detected to a similar extent as for baseline in around 1-3% of patients across treatment groups.  
A requested comparison of the immunogenic potential of other anti-VEGF agents (e.g. aflibercept and 
ranibizumab) did not indicate reason for concern.  Upon request, the applicant also provided a list of 
patients with treatment induced ADAs for each of the applied faricimab treatment schedules (i.e. Q8W, 
Q12W and Q16W). No relevant differences were recognized across treatment schedules with respect to 
the reported incidences of ADAs. Furthermore, the Applicant clarified that 3 of the 75 ADA-positive 
subjects (across pooled phase 3 studies) were recorded with serious AEs (worsening of nAMD, uveitis 
and vitritis in the study eye) and provided details on these three subjects . Two of these events 
(uveitis and vitritis) were considered related to study treatment, but any relation of these adverse 
events to the presence of anti-faricimab antibodies is not evident. Timing of events (ADA detection and 
onset of SAEs) does not exclude a potential negative impact of ADAs, but a clear causal relation 
between the occurrence of ADA and serious AEs cannot be established with the data at hand for the 
nAMD clinical program. 
The applicant has presented cumulative safety data relating to IOI events in the nAMD population up 
to week 60 in which the exposure adjusted incidence rate for IOI was 2.26 per 100 PY for the faricimab 
arm and 1.28 per 100 PY for aflibercept, indicating one additional IOI event in the faricimab group per 
100 patient years.  
The rate for IOI per individual treatment regime was Q16W faricimab treatment regime (2.06) with a 
higher overall incidence of IOI events with faricimab dosing regimes Q8W (5.38) and Q12W (4.94) are 
noted, which are concerning in the context of the evolving safety profile of farcimab, particularly over 
longer term treatment. The applicant was asked to discuss this finding further and to discuss plans to 
monitor this issue beyond routine pharmacovigilance, going forward, particularly in relation to the 
more frequent faricimab posology regimes.  
The Applicant clarified that immunogenicity data beyond the primary analysis will be available at the 
time of the final Week 112 analysis for TENAYA and LUCERNE, which will be submitted after approval. 
In TENAYA and LUCERNE, patients in the faricimab arm were on fixed Q8W, Q12W, Q16W treatment 
intervals until the Week 60 visit; from Week 60 onward, all faricimab patients were treated according 
to a personalized treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen. Treatment interval analysis (i.e., analysis by 
different faricimab ‘posology regimes’) beyond week 60 cannot be easily performed, since the PTI 
allows for a more flexible dosing regimen based on patient needs, allowing patients to be dosed at 
different intervals. As such, patients may not remain on one interval for the remainder of the study. 
ADAs were assessed in faricimab treated patients at baseline and at Weeks 4, 20, 48, 76 and 112. ADA 
occurrence in TENAYA and LUCERNE by treatment interval at Week 24 (Q8W, Q12W, or Q16W) 
through Week 48 was provided as part of D120 Response to Question (OC 163). Considering median 
time to ADA occurrence was 20 weeks after start of the treatment, the Applicant believes that ADA 
data by treatment interval up to Week 48 supports the observation that no relevant differences were 
recognised across treatment schedules with respect to the reported incidences of ADAs. 
As described, a long-term extension (LTE) study is ongoing for the patients who completed TENAYA 
and LUCERNE through Week 112. This LTE study (AVONELLE-X) will continue to collect safety 
information, including assessment of immunogenicity, for a further two years, resulting in up to four 
years of exposure and long-term safety for 991 patients from the baseline of TENAYA/LUCERNE 
through the end of AVONELLE-X. All patients in AVONELLE-X are treated with faricimab PTI, therefore, 
the safety data from the LTEs will comprise more frequent dosing regimens. Key safety outcomes 
include AEs (ocular and non-ocular), SAEs, and AESIs, along with collection of samples for the 
 
 
assessment of ADA at 5 different time points throughout the LTE study (i.e., Day 1, Week 8, Week 12, 
Year 1, and Year 2). 
The Applicant will continue to monitor the long-term immunogenicity including ocular events, SAEs, 
and AESIs in ADA-positive patients within the ongoing LTE study AVONELLE-X. The AVONELLE-X final 
CSR is currently planned to be available for submission to the Agency in Q1 2025 but in the interim, 
the applicant will provide a more regular update on this topic in the PSURs. 
nAMD: Discontinuations due to AEs 
The rate of patient discontinuation from treatment up to the week 48 was numerically higher overall in 
the faricimab treatment group compared to the aflibercept treatment group (1.7% and 0.6% of 
discontinuations due to AEs as well as 0.9% and 0.2% due to ocular AEs for faricimab and aflibercept 
at week 48, respectively). Similarly, a numerically higher rate of dose interruption was observed during 
the pivotal clinical studies in the faricimab treatment arm (1.8% versus 1.2%).  
In the SUR, the overall incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through the SUR 
Clinical Cut-Off Date was higher in the faricimab arm compared with that in the aflibercept arm (3.3% 
in the faricimab arm and 1.5% in the aflibercept arm).  
The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date remained 
low (4.7% in the faricimab arm and 3.5% in the aflibercept arm).  
The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation remained low in both treatment 
arms (13 patients [2.0%] in the faricimab arm and 5 patients [0.8%] in the aflibercept arm).  
The incidence of IOI events leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in the faricimab arm than 
that in the aflibercept arm (5 patients [0.8%] in the faricimab arm and 1 patient [0.2%] in the 
aflibercept arm). 
The overall trend for discontinuation rates based on the available cumulative safety data indicate that 
discontinuation rates are generally found to be slightly higher for faricimab compared to aflibercept.  
In the preliminary safety data from week 112 provided with the responses, the incidence of AEs 
leading to study treatment discontinuation was low in both treatment arms (28 patients [4.2%] in the 
faricimab arm and 18 patients [2.7%] in the aflibercept arm).  
The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation through Week 112 was also low 
(17 patients [2.6%] in the faricimab arm and 8 patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm), which was 11 
more patients in the faricimab arm and 7 more patients in the aflibercept arm since the primary 
analysis (at Week 48). No pattern was observed in ocular AEs leading to study treatment 
discontinuation in terms of timing and per regimen. The most common ocular AE leading to study 
treatment discontinuation was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (verbatim, worsening of 
nAMD; 9 patients [1.4%] in the faricimab arm and 4 patients [0.6%] in the aflibercept arm). 
This topic should continue to be closely followed through the LTE study and regular updates on 
discontinuation rates should be provided in the PSURs. 
Diabetic macular edema  
DME:Data set 
The primary safety data analysis provided by the applicant for the diabetic macular edema indication is 
based on the pooled Phase III DME safety data (YOSEMITE and RHINE) up to the timepoint of the 
primary analysis (Week 56). A further update in the form of a 90 day Safety Update report (SUR) to 
April 2021 was provided with the responses. 
 
It is noted that the following dose schedules were tested in the pivotal studies: 
• 
Faricimab Q8W group: 6 mg faricimab injections Q4W to Week 20, followed by 6 mg faricimab 
injections Q8W to Week 96, followed by the final study visit at Week 100. 
• 
Faricimab PTI  group: 6 mg faricimab injections Q4W to at least Week 12, followed by 
Personalized Treatment Interval dosing In this arm the frequency of dosing in this arm could 
range from Q4W to Q16W.) 
The faricimab Q8W fixed dose regimen was selected to match the approved dose regimen for the 
active comparator aflibercept Q8W arm in the control arm. The faricimab PTI regimen incorporates the 
possibility to extend, as well as reduce dosing intervals according to patient’s treatment needs, thereby 
avoiding overtreatment and reducing burden of excessive check-ups/HCP visits for patients who can 
maintain their initial vision gains without frequent injections, while providing more intensive treatment 
to those patients who need it. A reduced need for injection while maintaining visual acuity is seen as 
highly desirable, as a large proportion of AEs of intravitreally administered VEGF-inhibitors are 
injection-related. A non-inferior visual acuity outcome vs. aflibercept Q8W while being able to reduce 
the number of injections would be regarded as relevant. In the scenario of a non-inferior outcome of 
the faricimab, its safety profile needs to be highly reassuring.  
For the SmPC dose schedules are similar to those investigated in the Faricimab PTI group.  In line with 
the SmPC the recommended dose for Vabysmo is 6 mg administered by intravitreal injection every 4 
weeks (monthly) for the first 4 doses. Thereafter, based on the physician's judgement of the individual 
patient’s visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the dosing interval may be extended up to every 16 weeks 
(4 months), in increments of 4 weeks. 
In both pivotal studies aflibercept was used as a comparator. Eylea was approved in the EU  in 2012 
and therefore the safety profile of this treatment is established. There are some differences between 
mode of action of faricimab and aflibercept which could have some implication for safety. Faricimab is 
a humanized bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes 
both angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Aflibercept acts as a 
soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than their natural receptors, 
and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors.  
The aflibercept Q8W fixed dose regimen was chosen for the comparator arm, in line with the posology 
of aflibercept in the DME indication. As per SmPC for aflibercept, the treatment should be initiated with 
one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one injection every two months. 
However, after the first 12 months of treatment with aflibercept, and based on visual and/or anatomic 
outcomes, the treatment interval may be extended, such as with a treat-and-extend dose regimen, 
where the treatment intervals are gradually increased to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic 
outcomes. 
While the comparison between faricimab Q8W and aflibercept Q8W dose regimen is appropriate, the 
comparison between an unfixed PTI dose regimen of faricimab AND a fixed Q8W dose regimen for 
aflibercept raises some concerns. As these two dose regimens are inherently different, the 
interpretation of safety findings is difficult, in particular given that a number of patients in the 
faricimab PTI arm received more intensive treatments i.e. more injections than the patients in the 
aflibercept Q8W arm. A PTI regimen for the comparator at year 2 in one of the two pivotal trials, as 
suggested during a scientific advice procedure, would have been more suitable, however, Applicant’s 
arguments as to why these schedules were chosen can be followed (see discussion on efficacy). 
DME: Exposure 
 
In pivotal studies, in total 1262 patients were exposed to faricimab (630 patients received faricimab in 
the Q8W dosing scheme while 632 patients received faricimab in the PTI dosing scheme) while 625 
were exposed to aflibercept (active comparator). Both treatment naïve patients and patients who have 
been previously treated with IVT anti-VEGF therapy were recruited in the study, which is considered 
important to improve external validity. The median duration of exposure was the same between all 
treatment arms (56.1 weeks).  At the time of submission, an additional analysis up to clinical cut-off 
date (Clinical Cut-Off Date) was provided which includes additional 16.1 weeks of treatment duration 
for 1031 patients in the combined faricimab arms and 15.8 weeks of treatment duration for 506 
patients in the aflibercept Q8W arm.  It needs to be highlighted that both pivotal studies were ongoing 
at the time of submission. With the responses to the Day 120 List of Questions the Applicant submitted 
additional safety data i.e the 90-day safety update report was provided (SUR). As of the SUR Clinical 
Cut-Off Date, the median duration of exposure was similar in all treatment arms (93.1, 95.1, and 92.9 
weeks in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively); approximately an 
additional 37 weeks (median) of duration of exposure was provided in this SUR compared with SCS 
(Week 56). 
It is noted that the RHONE-X LTE extension study is still ongoing. The applicant is requested to provide 
regular PSUR updates on emerging long-term safety identified in this study. 
Dose investigated 
The PTI arm comprised a myriad of different individualised treatment schemes, with differences seen 
not only between patients but also within the same patient in the course of treatment and different 
treatment regimens have not been investigated systematically. This is of lesser concern for longer 
intervals i.e. Q12W and Q16W, as they are expected to be associated with less AEs. Contrary to that, a 
more intensive dosing scheme such as Q4W is expected to be associated with more AEs. By pooling all 
the data together, the safety of a specific dosing interval is not discernible i.e. likely better safety 
profile of longer intervals is obscured by the likely worse safety profile of shorter intervals. The 
applicant was requested to provide separate safety analyses for patients in faricimab PTI arm who 
received less versus equal or more administrations in comparison to the planned administrations in the 
fixed Q8W dosing schedule   
Furthermore, about 10%-15% of patients in both phase III studies remained in the Q4W dosing 
interval through Week 56 without a single increase in dosing interval. As this is the most intense dose 
regimen and it is expected to be associated with more AEs, a separate safety analysis was needed for 
patients who remained in the Q4W interval through Week 56 and beyond.  
The applicant provided the requested analysis. In relation to the safety profile depending on the 
number of injections, based on presented (limited) data there is no strong evidence to support higher 
incidence of AE with increased number of injections, however small but consistent trends can be 
observed, in particular for ocular AEs. Also more ocular SAEs and AESI were reported with higher 
number of injections, although the interpretation of these results should be cautious due to overall low 
incidences. Higher incidence of cardiac disorders has also been observed with an increased numbers of 
injection, but same limitations pertaining to the small numbers apply here as well.  
The safety data for the faricimab Q4W dosing interval, albeit limited, indicate a higher risk of both 
ocular and non-ocular adverse events, including higher risk for serious AEs compared to faricimab Q8W 
interval but also compared to aflibercept Q8W dosing regimen.  
Consequently, the Applicant was requested to include an appropriate statement in the section 4.8 of 
the SmPC that dosing intervals shorter than Q8W are associated with a higher risk of ocular (AEs, SAEs 
and AESI) and systemic adverse events, including serious systemic adverse events 
The applicant included in the SmPC information that the data in this population is limited (see below) 
which is  insufficient.   
“Populations with limited data: There is only limited experience in the treatment of DME patients 
with type I diabetes, patients with HbA1c over 10%, patients with high-risk proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy (DR), sustained dosing intervals shorter than Q8W, or nAMD and DME patients with active 
systemic infections. There is also no experience of treatment with faricimab in diabetic patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the physician when 
treating such patients.” 
The Applicant appropriately reflected in the SmPC – upon request of the CHMP- the lack of information 
on dosing schedules with intervals shorter than 8 weeks.  
DME: Common adverse events 
In DME pivotal studies through Week 56 treatment-emergent Adverse Events were reported slightly 
more frequently the faricimab Q8W group (81.4%) as compared to the aflibercept Q8W treatment 
(78.1%). In the faricimab PTI group the incidences of subjects with any TEAE was lower (76.9%). The 
incidences of subjects with any SAE was higher in both faricimab (Q8W and PTI) as compared to the 
aflibercept Q8W group, although the difference was small. 23.7% and 19.9% of patients experienced 
SAEs in the faricimab Q8W and faricimab PTI respectively. SAEs were reported in 18.2 % in the 
aflibercept group.  
In DME pivotal studies through Week 56 a total 31 deaths were reported. 9 (1.4%) in patients 
receiving aflibercept and 22 (1.7%) in patients receiving faricimab. Upto the Clinical Cut-Off Date 35 
(2.8%) patients treated with faricimab experienced death as compared to 12 patients (1.9%) receiving 
aflibercept. The number of patients withdrawn from the study or withdrawn from the study treatment 
was small (2.5% or less in any treatment group) 
As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled Parent Studies the incidence of AEs remained 
generally comparable across all treatment arms (567/630 [90.0%], 551/632 [87.2%], and 545/625 
[87.2%] patients in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
DME: Ocular adverse events  
General information 
Through Week 56 the incidence of ocular adverse events was slightly higher in the faricimab groups 
(i.e Q8W-37.3%, PTI 35.6%) as compared to the aflibercept group (34.4%). The most common ocular 
AEs reported were conjunctival haemorrhage (6.7% for faricimab and 6.1% for aflibercept), cataract 
(4.6% for faricimab and 4.8% for aflibercept), vitreous detachment (3.2% for faricimab and 3.2% for 
aflibercept) and vitreous floaters (3.4% for faricimab and 1.6% for aflibercept).  
As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled Parent Studies the incidence of ocular AEs in the 
study eye was 47.5%, 47.3%, and 43.7% of patients in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and 
aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively, with an increase of approximately 10 percentage points in the 
incidence in all treatment arms compared with SCS (Week 56). There were a small number of ocular 
AEs with ≥2% difference between the faricimab Q8W or PTI arms and the aflibercept Q8W arm such as 
cataract, dry eye, intraocular pressure increased, and vitreous floaters. 
DME: Intraocular pressure increased 
 
 
 
Intraocular pressure increased occurred with slightly higher frequency in the faricimab group as 
compared to the aflibercept group. Through the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 24 patients (3.8%), 18 patients 
(2.8%), and 14 patients (2.2%) experienced an intraocular pressure increased AE in the study eye in 
the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. Through the Clinical Cut-Off 
Date, 2 patients (0.3%), 8 patients (1.3%), and 1 patient (0.2%) developed ocular hypertension in the 
study eye in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. Cases of 
intraocular pressure increased were considered as treatment-related ocular AEs by investigators. In 
two cases i.e one case of intraocular pressure increased on one case of Ocular hypertension required 
surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight.  
At the time of the final 2-year analysis of YOSEMITE and RHINE the proportion of patients with events 
with IOP increased was 5.1% and 3.3% in the faricimab Q8W and PTI arms, respectively, and 2.6% in 
the aflibercept arms difference faricimab Q8W versus aflibercept 2.5% (95%CI: 0.3%, 4.9%); 
difference faricimab PTI versus aflibercept: 0.8 (95%CI: -1.3, 2.8).  
The applicant was requested to discuss cases of intraocular pressure increased reported in pivotal 
studies. 
The applicant considers that volume rather than mode of action is relevant to increase in IOP, and 
faricimab volume is considered acceptable as evident in the lack of significant findings in pre-dose to 
postdose IOP fluctuations. Further, the applicant clarified that nearly all intraocular pressure increased 
AEs were considered non-serious, with the exception of one event in the faricimab PTI arm in RHINE 
study. This serious case resolved the same day following Anterior Chamber Paracentesis and was 
considered as mild in severity and not related to study drug.  
In addition, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the mean change from pre-dose to post-
dose IOP across the treatment arms, and there was no observable increase in pre-dose IOP from 
baseline over time. Finally, no safety signal has been detected with respect to sustained IOP increases 
or ocular hypertension to date. This justification provided by the applicant was considered acceptable. 
DME: Sight-Threatening Adverse Events 
Through Week 56, a higher incidence of sight-threatening adverse events in the study eye occurred in 
both faricimab arms compared to the aflibercept Q8W arm (15 patients [2.4%], 17 patients [2.7%], 
and 6 patients [1.0%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively). 
The per injection rate of AESIs through Week 56 in the study eye was slightly higher in both faricimab 
arms compared to aflibercept arm (0.32%, 0.33%, and 0.10% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, 
and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively.) 
The applicant was requested to provide the updated safety data and comment on the fact that the 
majority of sight-threatening adverse events were reported in the faricimab groups (i.e in 32 patients) 
whereas in the comparator group these events were only reported in 6 patients.  The applicant 
provided the updated safety information. 
By Week 100  the incidence of AESIs of sight-threatening events was (defined as decrease of ≥30 
letters in visual acuity (VA) score) 18 patients [2.9%], 23 patients [3.6%], and 16 patients [2.6%] the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively 
The event requires surgical or medical intervention: (6 patients [0.95%], 8 patients [1.3%], and 4 
patients [0.7%] the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively 
However, the majority of the ocular AESIs in the study eye resolved, resolved with sequelae, or were 
resolving by the Week 100, and were considered not related to study drug by the investigator and did 
 
not result in a change to study drug. While drug had to be withdrawn in 3 patients in pooled faricimab 
arms, there were no cases of drug withdrawal in pooled aflibercept arms. 
It can be agreed with the applicant that the sight-threatening events were reported at an overall low 
incidence however, taking into consideration these imbalances sight-threatening AEs should continue 
to be closely monitored particularly over longer term treatment with faricimab.  The applicant clarified 
that sight-threatening adverse events will be monitored within the ongoing long-term extension (LTE) 
study, RHONE-X. This is acceptable. 
DME: Intraocular inflammation events  
Through Week 56, the incidence of intraocular inflammation events in the study eye was higher in both 
faricimab groups as compared to the aflibercept groups. These events were reported in 8 patients 
[1.3%], 9 patients [1.4%], and 4 patients [0.6%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept 
Q8W arms, respectively.  
The following events were most frequently reported: iritis, uveitis, vitritis and iridocyclitis.  Although 
the majority of intraocular inflammation events in the study eye were mild or moderate in severity, 
severe events were also reported but only in the faricimab groups. These severe events were one case 
of vitritis in the faricimab Q8W arm and 3 cases of uveitis in the faricimab PTI arm.  
There were 2 patients with at least one IOI event in the study eye associated with vision loss ≥15 
letters (uveitis and chorioretinitis) and 1 patient with vision loss ≥30 letters keratic precipitates and 
uveitis)); all events occurred in the faricimab PTI arm and were considered to be related to faricimab. 
There was one IOI SAE of reported keratouveitis initially suspected to be related to possible herpetic 
origin. Again this SAE was reported in the faricimab group, and later on the investigator considered the 
event of keratouveitis to be related to faricimab and procedures (unspecified). The Applicant’s claim on 
the lack of causality between faricimab and keratouveitis has not been substantiated. The Applicant is 
asked to provide evidence for the lack of causality or otherwise include keratouveitis in the PI 
(OC/SmPC). 
The provided data seems to indicate that the risk of development of intraocular inflammation/infection 
could be higher in patients treated with faricimab as compared to those treated with aflibercept. In 
particular, there are concerns in relation to the higher frequency of endophthalmitis. The applicant was 
requested to discuss and provide the updated safety data in relation to this safety issue. 
Through Week 100 the pooled rate of IOI (uveitis including iritis, iridocyclitis, and vitritis) for 
YOSEMITE and RHINE was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.03%, 2.44%) for faricimab and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.54%, 
2.29%) aflibercept (difference of 0.5% (95% CI: -0.82%, 1.49%. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
for any IOI through Week 100 were low but slightly higher in the PTI group (0.88, 1.38, and 0.88, in 
the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. 
The pooled rate of endophthalmitis for YOSEMITE and RHINE through the entire studies was 0.5% 
(95% CI: 0.22%, 1.03%) for faricimab and 0.2% (95%CI: 0.03%, 0.90%) for aflibercept (difference 
of 0.3% [95% CI: -0.47%, 0.89%]). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for endophthalmitis through 
Week 100 were 0.26 per 100 PY and 0.09 per 100 PY for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively. 
In addition, IOIs occurred more frequently in ADA positive patients i.e the incidence of IOI in ADA-
positive patients was 5/75 [6.7%] in nAMD (Week 48) and 15/128 [11.7%] in DME (Week 100) 
compared with 7/582 [1.2%] in nAMD (Week 48) and 5/1124 [0.4%] in DME (Week 100) ADA-
negative patients. 
It can be agreed that the risk of IOI was low however the frequency of IOI in patients treated with 
faricimab was slightly higher than in patients treated with aflibercept (in particular in the PTI group). 
 
Further, it is noted that IOIs occurred more frequently in ADA positive patients. Therefore, cases of 
IOI, (including those reported in ADA positive patients), should continue to be closely monitored 
particularly over longer term treatment with faricimab and updated safety data presented as data 
emerges, especially considering the status of faricimab as a new active substance with new mode of 
action. Types of IOI reported in ADA positive patients need to be recorded and compared to those 
observed in a general population. The applicant was requested to outline plans to monitor this issue 
going forward (beyond routine pharmacovigilance) taking also into consideration the faricimab 
posology regimen. The applicant clarified that cases of IOI will be monitored within the ongoing long-
term extension (LTE) study, RHONE-X. This is acceptable, and the applicant will present the updated 
safety data regularly in the PSUR. 
DME: Retinal Vascular Occlusive Disease  
A number of post-marketing cases of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusions typically 
occurred in the presence of intraocular inflammation have been reported with another anti-VEGF 
product. 
In pivotal studies in patients DME for this application, there were only a few cases of retinal vascular 
occlusive disease. 
The Applicant has provided a clear overview of reported cases relating to retinal vascular occlusive 
disease from the faricimab clinical development programme. It is noted that these cases were 
confounded by the presence of medical co-morbidities and were not considered by the investigators to 
be causally related to treatment with faricimab. Of note, no reported cases of retinal vascular occlusive 
disease were associated with intraocular inflammation. In the majority of cases, treatment with 
faricimab was not interrupted. However, this topic should continue to be closely monitored and 
updated safety data presented as data emerges, especially considering the status of faricimab as a 
new active substance with new mode of action. 
DME: Slitlamp examination 
The proportion of patients by grade for the worst post-baseline outcome in the study eye through the 
Clinical Cut-Off Date on slitlamp examination with regard to the anterior chamber cell grade, vitreous 
cell grade and vitreous haemorrhage grade was slightly higher in the faricimab arms, in particular in 
the faricimab Q8W arm: anterior chamber cell grade 1+: 11 (1.7%), 6 (0.9%) and 2 (0.3%); vitreous 
cell grade 1: 7 (1.1%), 2 (0.3%) and 2 (0.3%); vitreous haemorrhage grade 1+: 8 (1.3%), 5 (0.8%) 
and 4 (0.6%) in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI and aflibercept arm, respectively. The applicant was 
asked to discuss these differences and potential reasons for their higher incidence with faricimab, 
however, the latter has not been provided. Updated data (up to Week 100) were in accordance with 
earlier results i.e. while differences between treatments were small, they were in favour of aflibercept.  
DME Ocular Adverse Events in the Fellow Eye  
Through Week 56, 34.4%, 30.9%, and 33.8% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the 
fellow eye in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. Also types of 
AEs reported in the fellow eye were similar to those reported in the study eye 
DME: Serious ocular adverse events 
A higher incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in both faricimab arms compared 
with the aflibercept Q8W arm (15 patients [2.4%], 19 patients [3.0%], and 8 patients [1.3%] in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. Also the per-injection rate of 
serious ocular AEs in the study eye was slightly higher in faricimab arms i.e. 0.34%, 0.39%, and 
0.14% in faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The applicant was 
requested to discuss these imbalances  
 
 
The most common serious ocular AEs in the study eye (≥ 2 patients in the combined faricimab arms or 
aflibercept Q8W arm) by PT were diabetic retinal oedema, endophthalmitis, cataract, vitreous 
haemorrhage, uveitis, visual acuity reduced transiently, ocular hypertension and retinal tear.  
This higher incidence of serious ocular AEs was also observed during the entire study (through Year 2) 
in the pooled DME studies and the difference in the incidence of serious ocular adverse events was 
approx. 1.6%. In the pooled DME data through Year 2, the overall rate of serious ocular AEs in the 
study eye per 100 PYs of exposure were 2.99, 3.72, and 1.93 in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and 
aflibercept arms, respectively. 
The applicant indicated that this difference is primary driven by SAEs of cataract, diabetic retinal 
oedema, endophthalmitis, retinal tear, retinal vein occlusion and events of uveitis. 
Although the difference in the incidence of serious ocular AEs was low (approx. 1.6%) taking into 
consideration these imbalances, serious ocular AEs should continue to be closely monitored particularly 
over longer term treatment with faricimab and updated safety data presented as data emerges, 
especially considering the status of faricimab as a new active substance with new mode of action. 
DME: Serious intraocular inflammation  
There are concerns regarding a higher incidence of inflammation related SAEs reported in the faricimab 
as compared to the aflibercept group such as endophthalmitis (4 patients [0.3%]  vs. 1 patient 
[0.2%]) and uveitis (3 patients [0.2%] vs. 0), respectively. It is noted that endophthalmitis was 
classified by the applicant as an AE of special interest   In addition, in 4 patients inflammation SAEs 
were considered as related to the study drug by investigators including  cases of uveitis, chorioretinitis 
and keratouveitis. In all 4 patients treatment with faricimab was permanently discontinued due to 
these SAE. Cases of serious intraocular inflammation should continue to be closely monitored 
particularly over longer term treatment.  
DME: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tear 
One case of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and two cases of retinal tear were reported in the 
faricimab groups in DME studies. There were no such events in the aflibercept arm.  
The applicant claims that the risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tear in patients 
treated with faricimab is consistent with the risks associated with other approved intravitreal anti-VEGF 
monotherapies. This can be agreed as the incidence of these events (i.e. 0.2%) in DME pivotal studies 
is not higher than reported for other anti-VEGF agents.  The overall incidence of rhegmatogenous 
retinal detachment after intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents was reported to be up to 0.67%  
(Meyer et al, 2011 and Tolentino M, 2011). These risks are already highlighted in the SmPC.  
DME: Ocular haemorrhage 
There have been several reports of ocular haemorrhage following the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF 
drugs. In DME pivotal studies 3 SAEs of vitreous haemorrhage in the study eye were reported in 
patients with faricimab and one SAE of vitreous haemorrhage was reported in the aflibercept arm. It is 
noted that vitreous haemorrhage is included as an ADR within Section 4.8 of the SmPC, because of its 
potential to be injection procedure-related.  
DME: Non-ocular adverse events  
Through Week 56, the incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable across all treatment arms (62.4%, 
60.9%, and 62.4% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). The 
following non-ocular events occurred in the higher frequency in the faricimab groups: back pain, 
bronchitis, couth, fall headache, upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting however, the difference 
between groups was ≥1%. 
As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled Parent Studies, the incidence and nature of non-
ocular AEs through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date was generally comparable to that reported in the SCS 
(Week 56) and across all treatment arms (72.4%, 73.1%, and 73.9% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab 
PTI, and aflibercept 
Q8W arms, respectively). 
The most common non-ocular AEs ( ≥5% incidence in any treatment arm: faricimab Q8W, faricimab 
PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively) by PT were generally consistent with those reported in 
SCS (Week 56), with newly added events of COVID-19 (4.9%, 6.8%, and 4.0%) and fall (5.6%, 4.3%, 
and 3.5%), and with no appreciable difference between faricimab and aflibercept. 
The applicant was asked to present the updated data and discuss the incidence of AEs within the SOC 
Cardiac, Infections and infestations and Vascular disorders.  
At the time of the final 2-year analysis of YOSEMITE and RHINE data, the proportion of patients with 
events in the Cardiac disorders SOC was 9.8%, 11.1%, and 10.2% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab 
PTI, and aflibercept arms, respectively. No particular pattern of the reported AEs can be observed.  
Nevertheless AEs within the SOC Cardiac disorders (within the definition of the APTC events) need to 
be monitored taking into consideration the novel mode of action of faricimab. 
Through Week 56, in general there was no difference in the incidence of AEs within the SOC Infections 
and infestations. AEs Infections and infestations were reported in 27.1% in the pooled faricimab 
groups compared to 32.6% in the aflibercept group. The applicant provided the updated data and 
highlighted that at the time of the final 2-year analysis of YOSEMITE and RHINE, there were slightly 
more events in the SOC Infections and Infestations with aflibercept vs faricimab i.e the proportion of 
patients with events in the infections and infestations SOC was 39.5% in the pooled faricimab groups 
compared to 42.7% in the aflibercept arm. At the time of the final 2-year analysis, in relation to 
Bronchitis, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection and pneumonia the difference between the treatment 
groups (pooled faricimab groups versus aflibercept arm) were less than 1%. For cough the difference 
between the treatment groups was 1.5%. The applicant considers that based on this data no update to 
section 4.4 and 4.8 is necessary and this can be agreed.  
In general there was no difference in the incidence of AEs within the SOC Vascular disorders.  There 
was no difference in the frequency of hypertension which occurred in 5.5% in the pooled faricimab 
groups compared to 5.9% in the aflibercept group. There was also no difference in the incidence of 
SAEs of hypertension AEs within the SOC Vascular disorders (within the definition of the APTC events) 
are planned to be monitored taking into consideration novel mode of action of faricimab  
DME:Non-ocular adverse events related to faricimab 
Following AEs were considered related to faricimab by the investigator: hypertension, visual 
hallucination, sudden hearing loss and rhinorrhoea. Based on the additionally provided data it can be 
agreed that at present there is insufficient evidence of a causal association between faricimab and 
hypertension, visual hallucination, sudden hearing loss and rhinorrhoea. No changes in the PI are 
deemed necessary at this time. 
DME: Serious non-ocular AEs 
Through Week 56, the incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was higher in the pooled faricimab groups 
(18.2%) as compared to the aflibercept group (16.3%). In patients treated with faricimab more 
serious non-ocular AEs were reported in the faricimab Q8W (20.2%) as compared to the faricimab PTI 
arm (16.3%).  
As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled Parent Studies, the incidence of serious non-ocular 
AEs remained generally comparable across all treatment arms (27.3%, 24.2%, and 25.8% in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). No particular pattern of the 
reported serious non-ocular AEs can be observed. 
 
DME: Non-ocular haemorrhage  
Cases of non-ocular haemorrhage were reported in pivotal studies in patients with DME. All these cases 
were reported in the faricimab group. There were no cases in the aflibercept group. 
In the faricimab group the following cases were reported: 2 cases of cerebral haemorrhage, 1 case of 
Haemorrhagic stroke, 2 cases of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 1 case of rectal haemorrhage, 1 case of 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The applicant was requested to discuss the potential role of 
faricimab in the development of these events. The applicant provided discussion on all haemorrhage 
cases reported in DME studies. It was highlighted that none of these events were reported to be 
causally related to study drug by the investigator, nor resulted in a change to study treatment. In 
addition it was highlighted that cases of non-ocular haemorrhage were also reported in aflibercept 
treated patients: rectal haemorrhage, lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, uterine haemorrhage, 
oesophageal varices haemorrhage, and vaginal haemorrhage. 
However, the observation made by Bendell et al. (2020) indicated that systemic Ang-2 inhibition is 
associated with an increased number of Grade ≥ 3 adverse events when compared to VEGF-A 
inhibition, such as haemorrhage, and GI perforations. Therefore, taking also into consideration medical 
importance of these events and the status of faricimab as a new active substance with new mode of 
action further monitoring is required. Haemorrhagic cases will be monitored in the ongoing long term 
safety studies.  
Deaths- for nAMD and DME indications 
At the beginning of the assessment, there was a concern that a numerically higher number of deaths 
occurred in patients treated with faricimab as compared to patients treated with aflibercept.  
The below forest plot of all-cause deaths across the faricimab clinical development program shows 
consistently higher hazard ratios for faricimab compared to controls. Some differences between studies 
were observed, most notably in the nAMD indication.] 
Importantly, it is highlighted that the clinical studies were not powered for this safety analysis as 
provided and thus, conclusions on statistical significance have to be interpreted with care. 
The applicant was asked to discuss imbalances in deaths reported in patients treated with faricimab 
and to present the updated data in relation to the number of deaths reported. 
For nAMD indication, the Applicant has provided end of study data (until week 112) for fatal events 
in nAMD studies. Reported deaths for the nAMD indication, considering the preliminary safety data 
from week 112 pooled data of both phase III studies (TENAYA and LUCERNE), do not raise concerns as 
the rates are broadly similar (3.5% and 3.2% of subjects for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively), 
excluding the COVID-19 deaths, the incidence of other deaths is also similar (0.4% difference).  
For the DME indication, the overall incidence of deaths in the faricimab and aflibercept arms in the 
DME studies through the end of study were comparable when excluding COVID-19 deaths.  
All Deaths Across the Faricimab Clinical Development Program with Rates per 100 Patient 
Years and Hazard Ratios Between Treatment Arms 
Relationship with PK criteria 
The applicant was asked whether the systemic concentration reported in patients receiving faricimab 
was sufficiently high to cause PD/side effects. In the response it was highlighted that maximum free 
 
 
 
 
 
faricimab plasma concentrations are approximately 600 and 6000-fold lower than in AH and vitreous, 
respectively. Cmax and Ctrough values are also low i.e Cmax appearing approximately 2-3 days post-
dose was 0.2 μg/mL (1.4 nM) and mean Ctrough for Q8W dosing was 0.003 μg/mL (0.02 nM).  In 
addition the applicant indicated the results of affinity and potency investigated in non-clinical 
experiments also supporting the applicant’s claims that the risk of systemic effect is low. 
Further, the Applicant has assessed the potential relationship of death with faricimab plasma exposure 
and systemic target suppression in individual patients. 
However, high inter-patient variability was observed in faricimab, free VEGF-A and free Ang-2 aqueous 
humor and plasma concentrations for DME and nAMD indication. Comparisons of faricimab plasma 
concentration (in > 1900 pts), free VEGF-A plasma concentrations and free Ang-2 plasma 
concentrations between DME and nAMD patients who died and those who survived do not indicate a 
clear pattern and plasma- concentration time-profiles are overlapping for patients who died and those 
alive. Free Ang-2 in  plasma were BLQ post-dose in a small number of pts (up to 3%), however BLQ 
values were also measured at baseline (in up to 3% of patients), therefore no firm conclusions can be 
drawn on BLQ values wrt target inhibition and thus there is some uncertainty on the absence of 
systemic target inhibition in a very small subset of patients.  In patients in whom levels of free-Ang2 
were BLQ no concerning systemic reactions. Due to the low number of patients with unexplained 
death, data on systemic target inhibition are limited as compared to the overall study population, Free 
VEGF or free-Ang2 results for some patients who died from unexplained deaths are incomplete . 
The Applicant argues that differences in pharmacological profiles between aflibercept and faricimab are 
unlikely to cause differences in reported fatal events due to the low systemic exposure and lack of 
systemic PD (i.e. absence of suppression in Ang-2 and VEGF-A measured in clinical plasma samples of 
more than 1900 patients across the four Phase III studies).  
Temporal relationship  
The applicant also presented the temporal relationship between the last dose of faricimab or aflibercept 
and death events. It was clarified that the half-life determined in plasma after vitreous administration 
is longer for aflibercept (11.4 days) than for faricimab (7.5 days). The analysis of temporal relationship 
between the last dose of faricimab or aflibercept and death events using 7 half-lives for both drugs 
indicated that the higher proportion of deaths which occurred within 7 half-lives were reported in the 
aflibercept group than in the faricimab group for both indications. 
In addition, the applicant has shown that 95% and 93% of deaths did not occur close to the Cmax 
(within 1 week of dosing) for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively. 
Therefore, the assessment of the time of death relative to the time to the maximum plasma 
concentration (Tmax) and taking the half-life of faricimab into account, do not clearly indicate a 
temporal relationship of death with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of faricimab.  
Conclusion on the imbalance in deaths 
Overall, the further analyses presented do not corroborate the hypothesis that the numerical 
imbalance in deaths can be causally attributed to faricimab. 
Nonetheless, the Applicant will provide regular reports for deaths to the EMA on a 6-monthly basis for 
the initial 3 years post approval. The Agency will also be informed in case a signal or pattern is 
identified between reporting periods. This is acknowledged and it is highly recommended to put a focus 
on subjects with high blood pressure and vascular disease (especially relevant for the DME indication) 
and subjects ≥85 years (especially relevant for the nAMD indication) in this specific observation.  
 
 
 
 
APTC events for nAMD and DME indications 
The applicant indicated that the systemic exposure to faricimab in humans following intravitreal 
injection is low; maximum plasma free faricimab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 
600- and 6000-fold lower than in aqueous and vitreous humor, respectively. No adverse effects on 
general safety pharmacology endpoints were observed in nonclinical studies up to the highest doses, 
achieving maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of about 10- up to more than 700-fold greater than 
faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in nAMD and DME patients (popPK model 
following 6 mg Q8W dosing).  
Nevertheless, taking into consideration that thromboembolic events have been reported after 
intravitreal injection for other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, APTC-defined 
events were reviewed in a blinded manner by an Independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). 
Evaluation and adjudication of vascular events and vascular deaths was based on assessment of AEs 
according to APTC definitions (The CATT Research Group 2011). 
Vascular events were defined as non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes or vascular deaths. 
Vascular deaths were further defined as definitely or possibly vascular, which includes all deaths 
attributed to cardiac, cerebral, haemorrhagic, embolic, other vascular or unknown case. 
The applicant outlined that the through Week 56 for DME indication, the incidence of externally 
adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an independent clinical coding committee) was low and 
comparable across treatment arms (2.1%, 1.9%, and 2.2% in the faricimab Q8W, and faricimab PTI, 
and aflibercept Q8W arms,). In assessing cumulative data from baseline to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, 
2.2%, 1.9%, and 2.4% of patients experienced at least one externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATE 
in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. 
In the nAMD indication, APTC events were reported as follows through Week 48, the incidence of 
externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an independent clinical coding committee) 
was n=7 patients [1.1%] in the faricimab arm and n=6 patients [0.9%] in the aflibercept arm).  
The death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab arm and 3 
patients (0.5%) in the aflibercept arm. All death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 1 patient 
each. 
In relation to fatal cases arising from APTC events, there was trend towards a higher number of fatal 
cases of adjudicated APTC events reported following treatment with faricimab at week 60 compared 
with the aflibercept treatment group, with the number of fatal cases reported increasing by 5 for 
faricimab (n=2 or 0.3% at 40 weeks increasing to n=7 or 1.1% at week 60 for faricimab) versus (n=3 
or 0.5% at week 40 for aflibercept increasing to n=5 or 0.8% at week 60).  
Four additional fatal and non-fatal cases relevant to the discussion of APTC events were reported in the 
Phase II clinical studies with faricimab but note that these events were not included in the overall 
analysis of adjudicated APTC events. 
Three of the non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related 
to study treatment: ischaemic stroke in the faricimab Q8W arm, lacunar stroke in the faricimab PTI 
arm, and cerebrovascular accident in the aflibercept Q8W arm. The Applicant has provided case 
narratives for these patients. Based on the additional information, a causal relationship between 
faricimab and reported non-fatal strokes is unlikely, but due to a close temporal relationship between 
the last administered dose of faricimab in 2 patients, and the fact that one of them received only 2 
doses of faricimab before developing an adverse event, a causal relationship cannot be completely 
ruled out. 
Based on the cumulative exposure-adjusted data presented in the 90 day SUR, there were no apparent 
imbalances in APTC events between faricimab and aflibercept in the nAMD population. 
  
However, it is highlighted that the final data set from the nAMD pivotal trials is still outstanding at this 
time and a preliminary safety overview was provided with the responses which indicates that through 
Week 112, the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs was low and comparable across 
treatment arms (3.3% and 3.0% in the faricimab and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
The Applicant has also provided a detailed discussion in response to this request to further elaborate 
on the imbalances noted between the DME pivotal trials YOSEMITE and RHINE in relation to APTC-
adjudicated deaths. 
The rate of APTC-defined deaths per 100 patient years (taking into account the whole study periods) 
was higher in both faricimab arms compared to aflibercept arm in YOSEMITE [i.e. hazard ratio between 
treatment arms HR 1.58 (95% CI 0.61, 4.08); and HR 1.72 (95% CI 0.68, 4.36) in faricimab Q8W and 
faricimab PTI arm, respectively]. This finding was not replicated in RHINE, on the contrary, the rates 
per 100 patient years were lower with both faricimab arms  compared to aflibercept [HR 0.71 (95%CI 
0.23, 2.24) and 0.41 (95%CI 0.11, 1.59) in faricimab Q8W and faricimab PTI arm, respectively]. The 
Applicant could not identify potential underlying reasons for this discrepancy. When comparing the 
baseline characteristics between both of these Phase III studies, it was highlighted by the Applicant 
that the majority of the patients in the YOSEMITE study were from U.S. and Canada (~53%), whereas 
in the RHINE study, the majority of the patients were from the ‘Rest of the world countries’ (56%-
57%). The Applicant states that this difference could potentially account for some regional differences 
between the two DME studies (US vs. Rest of the World) in terms of local treatment practice, AE 
reporting, and access to general healthcare which could be considered relevant given the COVID19 
pandemic. It is agreed that this might be one of the potential reasons for discrepancy, and it is agreed 
that the discrepancy points towards a lack of causal association with faricimab. 
During the assessment, small differences between studies were found as regards smoking history and 
systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg, but no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
The Applicant emphasises that the pattern of a higher incidence of APTC-defined deaths in the 
faricmab arms compared with the aflibercept arm in YOSEMITE is actually reversed in RHINE (with a 
similar percentage difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms) which does not support a 
signal of less favourable outcomes for faricimab, given the inconsistency across both studies. 
In YOSEMITE, there were a higher number of reports of fatal cases of ‘unknown cause’ when compared 
to RHINE (7 vs. 1). These cases were included in the overall rate of deaths in line with the APTC 
criteria. The Applicant has outlined that if the 7 deaths of unknown cause were excluded from 
YOSEMITE, the overall incidence of death would be 2.9% (9/313), 2.6% (8/313), and 1.9% (6/311) in 
the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms which is broadly comparable to the 
incidences seen in RHINE and in the literature for the aflibercept pivotal trials. It is possible that the 
imbalance in ‘unexplained death’ observed in YOSEMITE could account for the higher overall incidence 
of APTC-defined deaths in YOSEMITE. Only limited information on some of these deaths could be 
presented so it is possible that some of these cases do not represent true ATEs.  
The Applicant has also presented data from the published literature for aflibercept and ranibizumab 
which supports the finding that the overall rates of APTC-defined deaths for faricimab sit broadly within 
the ranges for this population. 
It is considered that Applicant’s response has explored the possible reasons for differences in fatal 
APTC events across the DME phase III pivotal studies and this concern is considered resolved. More 
broadly, the issue of fatal cases reported with faricimab is considered resolved (see above).  
It is acknowledged that the long term safety of faricimab will be closely followed through the LTE 
studies as outlined in the RMP. In addition, the Applicant has added ATE events as important potential 
risks to the RMP which is agreed. 
Safety in subgroups - DME indications 
Analyses were performed to examine key safety across the subgroups i.e by age, gender, race, 
medical history, baseline DR severity, and baseline HbA1c) 
Overall, through Week 56, differences in incidences of ocular AEs, incidences of nonocular AEs, 
incidences of SAEs, and incidences of ocular AESI between the treatment groups were small.  
As highlighted previously SAEs occurred more frequently in the faricimab groups than in the aflibercept 
group. This trend was also seen across analysed subgroups with the highest difference reported for 
patients with a history of renal and vascular disease.  
Pregnancy- nAMD and DME indications 
The systemic exposure to faricimab is low after ocular administration, but due to its mechanism of 
action, faricimab must be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic, hence effective 
contraception is recommended for female patients of childbearing potential.  The applicant was 
therefore asked to update the summary of safety concerns in the RMP to include pregnancy on the 
basis of the potential for exposure to the new active substance faricimab, with a novel mode of action 
in women of child-bearing potential (particularly in DME indication) and based on the conclusions in 
section 5.3 that faricimab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic. The updated RMP has been 
provided which is endorsed. 
ADA-positive subgroup- DME indication 
Overall, the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent ADA was low in the pooled Phase III DME 
studies at Week 56, with only a small increase observed during the second year of the studies: at 
Week 56, 105 patients had treatment-emergent ADA positivity (8.4%) and by Week 100, this rose to 
120 patients (9.6%). The incidence of treatment-induced ADA through end of studies (Week 100) was 
comparable in the two faricimab treatment arms (9.8% [Q8W] and 9.4% [PTI]), therefore there is no 
indication of disproportionate ADA incidence across the treatment groups. The reported results are 
however difficult to interpret without an appropriate comparison, as anti-drug antibodies were analysed 
for patients treated with faricimab only (as only two dosing schedules of faricimab are compared, no 
data is available on aflibercept). No data were generated for patients treated with aflibercept in pivotal 
studies or ranibizumab in the previous clinical phase 1/2 program.  
A higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA negative patients. 
The total number of IOI events per 1000 injections in the ADA-positive versus ADA-negative population 
was 13.2 (21 events) versus 0.35 (5 events). This difference was, however, more pronounced in the 
PTI arm compared to the Q8W arm. Upon enquiry, the Applicant has performed a thorough analysis of 
the potential underlying cause, however, at present time no firm conclusions can be made. The median 
time to onset of ADA was not different between Week 56 and Week 100, with 28.3 weeks at Week 56 
and 28.6 weeks at Week 100. 
There were 45/1124 patients (4.0%) in the ADA-negative population and 14/128 patients (10.9%) in 
the ADA-positive population with SAEs. 
In light of the known risk of immunogenicity towards therapeutic proteins, immunogenicity was added 
as a potential risk to the RMP, and described within Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 of the draft SmPC as 
part of the initial MAA.  
Study (treatment) discontinuations and dose interruptions 
While the incidence of IOI events that led to treatment discontinuation was overall low, more events 
were reported in pooled faricimab arms compared to aflibercept (5 cases versus no cases). All IOI 
events which led to faricimab discontinuation were considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator. 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
It is considered that concern in relation to imbalances in the number of deaths is resolved based on the 
PK/PD characteristic of faricimab and the low risk of systemic effect of faricimab (although the 
systemic inhibition cannot be completely ruled out). The difference in the number of deaths which was 
 
particularly seen for DME indication (0.9% difference) was less apparent when deaths related to COVID 
-19 were excluded (0.4% difference). Nevertheless, it is considered that deaths and other systemic 
AEs potentially associated with faricimab (such as ATE and cerebrovascular haemorrhagic events) need 
to be monitored in the long-term safety studies. The Applicant has added ATE events to the RMP as 
important potential risks. 
The Applicant has also committed to providing regular reports for deaths to the EMA on a 6-monthly 
basis for the initial 3 years post approval. The Agency will also be informed in case a worrisome signal 
or pattern is identified between reporting periods. This commitment is acknowledged and it is highly 
recommended to focus on subjects with high blood pressure and vascular disease (especially relevant 
for the DME indication) and subjects’ ≥85 years (especially relevant for the nAMD indication) in this 
specific observation.  
The ocular safety profile of faricimab is noted to be somewhat less favourable in certain aspects of the 
safety data when compared to aflibercept, particularly with the more frequent administration regimes. 
However, the overall differences in terms of absolute numbers are relatively small and are not always 
consistent across all safety parameters in both indications. In addition, these ADRs are well-established 
for approved products administered by IVT injection, some are procedural and related to the route of 
administration.  
Further, the applicant presented arguments that the observed differences in the safety profile with the   
most frequent dosing interval (Q8W) used in the nAMD studies may be explained by virtue of the study 
design – in that patients’ who had worse nAMD disease would have received more frequent treatment. 
In these circumstances, it can be agreed that it is difficult to ascertain whether the numerical 
differences in the rates of AEs seen in the different faricimab-treatment interval subgroups were as a 
result of these patients having received more injections, or whether as a result of them having more 
severe nAMD disease.However, the Applicant’s claim that treatment with faricimab requires fewer 
injections and less frequent trips to the hospital is not agreed, based on data through the first year of 
the studies. The overall efficacy and treatment burden is considered to be similar to aflibercept.  
Furthermore, it is highlighted that long term safety has been added to the RMP as missing information 
and the longer term ocular safety of faricimab will be closely monitored in the ongoing LTE safety 
studies and the results will be presented in the PSURs.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for by the Applicant is for the treatment of adult patients with 
Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). 
Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (nAMD)  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic, progressive, multifactorial disease of the macula 
and a leading cause of central vision loss among people over the age of 50 years. nAMD (also known 
as macular or choroidal neovascularisation [CNV] secondary to AMD) is a form of advanced AMD that 
causes rapid and severe vision loss. It is characterised by the abnormal proliferation of new blood 
vessels within the retina, or in the subretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) spaces. 
The diagnosis of nAMD is made clinically by ophthalmoscopy and multimodal retinal imaging 
techniques, which include optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography 
(FFA). The clinical manifestation of nAMD includes the presence of subretinal fluid (SRF) and/or 
intraretinal fluid (IRF), retinal and subretinal hemorrhage, retinal thickening, and pigment epithelial 
detachment. Without treatment, progression of the disease results in the formation of a fibrous scar 
and consequently severely reduced vision. 
The prevalence of nAMD increases with age, with estimates in the United States in 2011 ranging from 
0.5% among people 65-69 years old to 14.6% among those 90 years old or older (Rudnicka et al. 
2012). Of the estimated 253 million people worldwide with visual impairment, more than 10 million 
(4.1%) were caused by AMD. 
In the future, the global population aged 60 years and older is projected to increase dramatically, 
resulting in a significant increase in the prevalence of nAMD from 23.47 million in 2010 to 80.44 million 
by 2050. 
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is regarded as the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and 
can occur as a complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. DME is the most common 
complication as well as a leading cause of central vision loss in patients with DR and can develop at 
any stage of DR severity, with increasing frequency as the underlying disease worsens.  
Approximately half of patients with DME will lose two or more lines of visual acuity within 2 years if left 
untreated. 
DME and DR are forms of the same underlying pathophysiological processes subsequent to 
microvasculopathy that is driven by hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. 
The loss of pericytes, retinal micro-aneurysms, dilated capillaries and vascular inflammation lead to the 
destabilisation of retinal vasculature, breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier and pathological 
increase in vascular permeability. However, the vision threatening complications of DR are not limited 
to DME but also include macular ischemia and PDR complications such as vitreous haemorrhage, 
retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma. 
On a molecular level, DME and DR are characterised by hypoxia-mediated release of pro-angiogenic, 
hyperpermeability, and pro-inflammatory mediators in the retina, with Ang-2 and VEGF-A playing the 
key role. 
The excess of Ang-2 and VEGF in the vitreous of patients with diabetic eye disease was shown to 
correlate with disease severity and is thought to mediate vessel destabilisation, vascular leakage, 
inflammation and, in later stages of disease, neovascularization. 
The diagnosis of DR is based on the detection and clinical manifestations of microvascular 
abnormalities in the retina. NPDR is characterized by microaneurysms, intraretinal haemorrhages, 
exudates, retinal nerve fibre layer infarcts and in more severe cases, venous beading and intraretinal 
microvascular abnormalities. PDR is characterized by neovascularization that can be detected 
anywhere on the retina, optic disc or in the anterior segment.  
DME affects 21 million people around the world, including 12% of people with Type 1 diabetes and 
28% of those with Type 2 diabetes. In patients diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes before the 
age of 30, the prevalence of DR reaches 97% when diabetes duration exceeds 15 years. 
Eventually, nearly all patients with diabetes will develop some form of retinopathy (ADA 2013; Postel 
et al. 2013). In 2019, the worldwide population of people living with diabetes was approximately 463 
million, and this is estimated to grow to 548 million by 2045 (Saeedi et al. 2019). The global burden of 
DME and DR is expected to increase significantly with considerable public health, socioeconomic, and 
quality-of-life consequences due to the combined impact on patients, caregivers, family members, and 
HCPs. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
nAMD 
The major goal of treatment is to avoid or recover lost vision and subsequently maintain vision in 
nAMD patients over time.  
The introduction of anti-VEGF therapies has markedly improved vision outcomes and changed the 
management of nAMD. 
The anti-VEGF therapies ranibizumab (Lucentis), aflibercept (Eylea), and brolucizumab (Beovu) are 
approved and used for the treatment of nAMD in the United States and European Union. 
The introduction of anti-VEGF therapy has resulted in an improvement of vision outcomes in patients 
with nAMD. However, for most patients, the current treatment paradigm involves frequent health care 
provider (HCP) visits and intravitreal injections in order to maintain vision gains (Heier et al. 2012; 
Maguire et al. 2016). This imposes a considerable burden on patients, their families, caregivers, and 
the healthcare system (Jaffe et al. 2018). 
Real-world data show that many patients with nAMD do not receive treatment at the perlabel 
recommended frequency, and the under-treatment in clinical practice may result in lower visual acuity 
gains compared with those observed in the clinical trials.  
Although anti-VEGF therapy is the current mainstay of treatment, nAMD is a multifactorial disease with 
VEGF being only one of the key drivers; sustained efficacy over time with fewer injections may be 
achievable by targeting additional drivers of angiogenesis such as Ang-2. In addition, nAMD has an 
inflammatory component not completely addressed by anti-VEGF treatments alone. New and more 
durable treatments that target additional pathways to those mediated by VEGF are therefore required, 
in order to provide visual acuity outcomes with less frequent dosing that are at least as good as those 
achieved with more frequent anti-VEGF monotherapy regimens. 
Current Therapies and Unmet Need for DME 
 
The primary treatment goals in DME are improving or maintaining visual acuity, reducing retinal fluid, 
improving the underlying diabetic retinopathy and preventing irreversible damage to the macula. The 
development of anti-VEGF therapy in the last decade has led to dramatic improvements in visual 
outcomes for patients with DME. Other available approved options for the treatment of DME include 
periocular or intravitreal steroids and steroid implants which have the limitations of severe side effects 
such as cataract and glaucoma. 
The availability of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments enabled robust improvements in visual outcomes 
accompanied by robust improvements in the underlying DR severity in patients with DME and DR 
severity improvements with anti-VEGF treatments were enabled also in patients with DR, with or 
without DME (Antoszyk et al. 2020). Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is approved for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME and the treatment of patients with PDR (with or without DME) in the European 
Union. Aflibercept (Eylea) is approved for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME in the 
European Union. Although intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of patients with DME and 
DR represent major advances, there is still an unmet need for improved therapies in these diseases. 
In the real world, a significant proportion of DME patients treated with approved therapies do not 
experience clinically meaningful improvements in vision or are unable to maintain their initial vision 
gains long-term due to a need for frequent HCP visits for injections or monitoring (Souied et al. 2015; 
Stefanickova et al. 2018; Shimura et al. 2020; Naujokaitis and Balaciuniene 2021). 
Given the multifactorial pathogenesis of DME and DR, treatments targeting additional pathways beyond 
VEGF are needed to comprehensively address the underlying pathology and to provide more durable 
efficacy which could reduce the burden of frequent HCP visits and intravitreal injections in these 
patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety submitted by the applicant for faricimab is based on the 
primary analysis results of the pivotal Phase III studies: 
Two identically designed Studies GR40306 and GR40844 (referred to as TENAYA and LUCERNE, 
respectively) in patients with nAMD which are Phase III, Multicentre, Randomised, Double- Masked, 
Active Comparator- Controlled, 112-week Study. 
And  
Two identically designed Studies GR40349 and GR40398 (referred to as YOSEMITE and RHINE, 
respectively) in patients with DME which are Phase III, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Masked, 
Active Comparator-Controlled, Three Parallel Groups, 100-week Study. 
The safety and efficacy of faricimab is further supported by data from the completed Phase II and 
Phase I studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In nAMD both pivotal studies TENAYA and LUCERNE demonstrated non-inferiority of faricimab 6mg 
given at intervals up to 16 weeks to aflibercept 2mg.  
The adjusted mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) averaged over weeks 
40, 44 and 48 in the TENAYA study was 5.8 and 5.1 letters in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, 
 
 
respectively. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA between the faricimab 
arm and aflibercept arm was 0.7 letters (95% CI: - 1.1, 2.5). The adjusted mean change from baseline 
in BCVA averaged over weeks 40, 44 and48 was 6.6 letters in both the faricimab and aflibercept arms 
of the LUCERNE study with a difference in adjusted mean change from baseline between the faricimab 
arm and aflibercept arm of 0.0 letters (95% CI - 1.7, 1.8). In both studies the lower bound of the 95% 
CI were above the non-inferiority margin of -4. 
In the pooled ITT population, 20.1% and 19.0% of patients in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, 
respectively, gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 40/44/48 with a difference of 
1.1% (95% CI: -3.2%, 5.4%) between the treatment arms.  
In the pooled ITT population, 20.9% and 20.2% of patients in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, 
respectively, gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 52/56/60 with a difference of 
0.7% (95% CI: -3.6%, 5.1%) between the treatment arms. 
In diabetic macular oedema the RHINE and YOSEMITE studies demonstrated non-inferiority of both 
faricimab treatment schedules (Q8W and a PTI schedule) to aflibercept in the ITT and treatment naïve 
populations for improvement from baseline in BCVA averaged over weeks 48, 52 and 56. 
The adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA in the RHINE study was 11.8 letters in the faricimab 
Q8W population, 10.8 letters in the faricimab PTI population and 10.3 in the aflibercept population. The 
difference in adjusted means compared to aflibercept arm for the faricimab Q8W dose was 1.5 letters 
(97.5% CI -0.1, 3.2) and for the PTI dose was 0.5 letters (97.5%CI -1.1, 2.1).  Similar results were 
seen in the treatment naïve population. In the YOSEMITE study in the ITT population the adjusted 
mean change from baseline was 10.7 lettersfor faricimab Q8W, 11.6 for faricimab PTI and 10.9 for 
aflibercept. The difference in adjusted means compared to aflibercept arm for the faricimab Q8W dose 
was -0.2 letters (97.5% CI -2.0, 1.6) and for the PTI dose 0.7 letters (97.5%CI -1.1, 2.5). Broadly 
similar results were seen in the treatment naïve population. In both studies the lower bound of the 
95% CI were well above -4 in the treatment naïve and ITT populations.  
In the pooled ITT population, 31.5%, 31.9% and 31.0% of patients in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab 
PTI and aflibercept arms, respectively, gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 
48/52/56. The difference in the adjusted proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters from baseline 
between the faricimab Q8W and PTI arms when compared with the aflibercept Q8W arm was 0.5% 
(95% CI: -4.8%, 5.8%) and 0.7% (95% CI: -4.4%, 5.9%) at Week 48/52/56. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
nAMD 
Only treatment naïve patients were included in the phase III studies. This limits the generalisability of 
the study results to anti-VEGF pre-treated patients. However, it is noted that the registration studies 
for other anti-VEGF agents in the nAMD indication only included treatment naïve populations.  In 
addition, the Applicant has also provided data from the AVENUE study showing maintenance of effect 
on visual acuity in patients switched from ranibizumab to faricimab. Real world data from other anti-
VEGF therapies also indicate that vision can be maintained after a therapy switch. 
In addition, the inclusion criterion threshold for the focal lesion size of ≤ 9-disc areas (DA) on FFA is 
likely to exclude a more advanced nAMD population. The VIEW study for aflibercept included patients 
with a DA of ≤ 12-disc areas. CHMP in the course of scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/701753/2018) 
had advised including patients with a disc area >9 DAs and ≤ 12 DAs.  It is noted that currently 
treatment is initiated earlier because of better outcomes and consequently lesion sizes are not as large 
as those treated in earlier registration studies Consequently, the proportion of study subjects with a 
lesion size between 9 and 12 disc areas is likely to be small. Therefore, the exclusion of the small 
population with a lesion size between 9 and 12 disc areas should not impact on the generalisability of 
the study results. 
There are uncertainties regarding the durability of the effect, particularly in the longer faricimab 
treatment intervals, after Week 60. Patients randomised to faricimab could have been assigned from 
the Week 20/24 treatment visits to one of three treatment intervals (dependent on specific criteria 
relating to CST and BCVA), namely an 8, 12 or 16 week interval.  
There is no data on the durability of the response for the individual faricimab treatment intervals. The 
period of follow up from Week 20/24 to Week 48 (primary endpoint) or week 60 is inadequate to make 
any judgement on durability of response particularly in those treated at a 16 week interval. The 
durability of effect can be fully evaluated once data beyond week 60 is available. Nevertheless, 
improvements in BCVA from baseline at week 12 were maintained for faricimab 6mg given at Q16W 
intervals averaged over weeks 52/56/60. 
DME 
There remain uncertainties as to what degree the presented results may support conclusions of non-
inferior efficacy within subgroups of an individualized treatment schedule with faricimab. This is 
appropriately addressed by the requirement to personalise treatment based on visual and anatomical 
outcomes in 4.2.  
In the RHINE trial, in the subgroup of patients with a baseline BCVA <=63 letters a higher proportion 
of patients in the Aflibercept arm had a ≥ 2-Step DRS improvement compared to the Faricimab Q8W 
arm in Rhine. It is agreed with the Applicant that this might be a chance finding given variability in the 
endpoint and the low number of subjects in the sub-group. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
nAMD indication 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the cumulative pooled data for total ocular AEs were higher for 
faricimab at 75.61 per 100PY versus 69.73 per 100 PY for aflibercept. 
At Week 48, there was a ≥1% difference in the faricimab treatment arm vs. aflibercept arm) for 
vitreous floaters (20 patients [3.0%] vs. 11 patients [1.7%]), and retinal pigment epithelial tear (19 
patients [2.9%] vs. 9 patients [1.4%]).  
The rate of severe ocular AEs to Week 48 was n= 13 patients (2.0%) in the faricimab arm and n=11 
patients (1.7%) for aflibercept. 
The overall rate of IOI in the study eye was n=13 patients [2.0%] in the faricimab arm and n=8 
patients [1.2%] in the aflibercept arm). Through Week 48, 3 patients (0.5%) in the faricimab arm and 
1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept arm experienced at least one severe IOI event in the study eye. The 
IOI events reported past Week 48 have been mild-moderate in intensity with no severe events 
reported to date. All except one IOI event (in the faricimab arm) occurred after treatment day 80. 
Through Week 60, the incidence of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs (adjudicated by an 
independent clinical coding committee) remained low and was comparable between the treatment 
arms (faricimab: 2.0% [Week 60] and 1.1% [Week 48] vs. aflibercept: 1.5% [Week 60] and 0.9% 
[Week 48]. 
Between Week 48 and Week 60, the death adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs were cardiac failure 
congestive, ill-defined disorder, pneumonia bacterial, pulmonary oedema, and subarachnoid 
haemorrhage (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the faricimab arm; and cardiac failure and glioblastoma 
multiforme (1 patient [0.2%] each) in the aflibercept arm. None of the death adjudicated APTC ATEs 
were suspected to be related to study treatment. Between Week 48 and Week 60, there was 1 patient 
(0.2%) in the faricimab arm and 2 patients (0.3%) in the aflibercept arm who experienced a non-fatal 
stroke (cerebrovascular accident in all patients). 
DME indication 
In DME pivotal studies through Week 56 treatment-emergent Adverse Events were reported slightly 
more frequently in the faricimab Q8W group (81.4%) as compared to the aflibercept Q8W treatment 
(79.2%). In the Faricimab PTI group the incidences of subjects with any TEAE was lower (76.9%). 
Through Week 56 the incidence of ocular AEs reported in the study eye was slightly higher in the 
faricimab groups (i.e Q8W 37.3%, PTI 35.6%) as compared to the aflibercept group (34.4%). The 
most common ocular AEs reported were conjunctival haemorrhage (6.7% for faricimab and 6.1% for 
aflibercept), cataract (4.6% for faricimab and 4.8% for aflibercept), vitreous detachment (3.2% for 
faricimab and 3.2% for aflibercept) and vitreous floaters (3.4% for faricimab  and 1.6% for 
aflibercept).  
Intraocular pressure increased occurred with a slightly higher frequency in the faricimab group as 
compared to the aflibercept group. At the time of the final 2-year analysis of YOSEMITE and RHINE the 
proportion of patients with events with IOP increased was 5.1% and 3.3% in the faricimab Q8W and 
PTI arms, respectively, and 2.6% in the aflibercept arms difference faricimab Q8W versus aflibercept 
2.5% (95%CI: 0.3%, 4.9%); difference faricimab PTI versus aflibercept: 0.8 (95%CI: -1.3, 2.8). 
Nearly all intraocular pressure increased AEs were considered non-serious, with the exception of one 
event in the faricimab PTI arm in RHINE. This serious case resolved the same day following Anterior 
Chamber Paracentesis and was considered as mild in severity and not related to study drug. 
By Week 100  the incidence of AESIs of sight-threatening events was (defined as decrease of ≥30 
letters in visual acuity (VA) score) 18 patients [2.9%], 23 patients [3.6%], and 16 patients [2.6%] in 
the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively. However, the majority of the 
ocular AESIs in the study eye resolved, resolved with sequelae, or were resolving by the Week 100, 
and were considered not related to study drug by the investigator and did not result in a change to 
study drug. 
Through Week 100, the  pooled rate of IOI (uveitis including iritis, iridocyclitis, and vitritis) for 
YOSEMITE and RHINE was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.03%, 2.44%) for faricimab and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.54%, 
2.29%); aflibercept  difference of 0.5% (95% CI: -0.82%, 1.49%. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
for any IOI through Week 100 were low (0.88, 1.38, and 0.88, in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, 
and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
Through Week 56, the retinal vascular occlusive disease AEs in the study eye were retinal vein 
occlusion reported in 3 patients in the faricimab groups and retinal artery embolism and retinal artery 
occlusion both reported in the aflibercept arm. After Week 56 to the Clinical Cut-Off Date, there was 1 
additional patient with a retinal vascular occlusive disease AE in the study eye i.e retinal artery 
occlusion in the faricimab Q8W arm. 
Through Week 56, a higher incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in both faricimab 
arms compared with the aflibercept Q8W arm (15 patients [2.4%], 19 patients [3.0%], and 8 patients 
[1.3%] in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. The per-injection 
rate of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was 0.34%, 0.39%, and 0.14% in the faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arm, respectively. The most common serious ocular AEs in the 
study eye (≥ 2 patients in the combined faricimab arms or aflibercept Q8W arm) by PT were diabetic 
retinal oedema, endophthalmitis, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, uveitis, visual acuity reduced 
 
transiently, ocular hypertension and retinal tear. In addition, there were 5 serious IOI events in 4 
patients, all of whom were in the faricimab PTI arm. In all 2 patients treatment with faricimab was 
permanently discontinued due to these SAE, all of which were considered by the investigator as related 
to faricimab.   
This higher incidence of serious ocular AEs was also observed the entire study (through Year 2) and 
the difference in the incidence of serious ocular adverse events was approx. 1.6%. In the pooled DME 
data through Year 2, the overall rate of serious ocular AEs in the study eye per 100 PYs of exposure 
were 2.99, 3.72, and 1.93 in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept arms, respectively. 
Through Week 56 the incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable across all treatment arms (62.4%, 
60.9%, and 62.4% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). The 
following non-ocular events occurred in the higher frequency in the faricimab groups: back pain, 
bronchitis, cough, fall headache and vomiting however, the difference between groups was ≥1%. 
As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the pooled YOSEMITE and RHINE Studies, the incidence and 
nature of non-ocular AEs through the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date was generally comparable to that 
reported in the SCS (Week 56) and across all treatment arms (72.4%, 73.1%, and 73.9% in the 
faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively). 
Through Week 56, the incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was higher in the pooled faricimab groups 
(18.2%) as compared to the aflibercept group (16.3%). As per the SUR Clinical Cut-Off Date in the 
pooled Parent Studies, the incidence of serious non-ocular AEs remained generally comparable across 
all treatment arms (27.3%, 24.2%, and 25.8% in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept 
Q8W arms, respectively). 
Cases of non-ocular haemorrhage were reported in pivotal studies in patients with DME.  
Through Week 56, in the faricimab group the following cases were reported: 2 cases of cerebral 
haemorrhage, 1 case of Haemorrhagic stroke, 3 cases of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 1 case rectal 
haemorrhage, 1 case of Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
nAMD study conduct 
In TENAYA 52 patients and in LUCERNE 23 patients had optional plasma samples or optional aqueous 
humour samples collected where prior informed consent was either not obtained or withdrawn. These 
were reported as major protocol deviations and all unconsented sample analyses were removed from 
the databases used for reporting. The extent of additional treatment burden and safety risk that was 
caused for these patients was further clarified and no specific safety concerns could be identified 
arising from the issue. 
All included patients were treated with faricimab only in their dedicated study eye and no data are 
reported on bilateral treatment with faricimab. However, clinical practice foresees bilateral treatment 
for nAMD and the clinical phase 3 studies included patients with bilateral disease. Implications on the 
safety profile related to bilateral treatment are currently unknown. The applicant was therefore asked 
to present proposals to generate further data in order to justify bilateral use in clinical practice going 
forward. It is envisaged that the ongoing LTE studies will generate relevant data. In the interim, 
strengthening of the SmPC has been agreed in order to reflect the limitations of the available data. 
Deaths - DME and nAMD indication   
 
 
Despite a numerical unbalance, it is considered that concern in relation to imbalances in the number of 
deaths is resolved based on the PK/PD characteristics of faricimab, the low risk of systemic effect of 
faricimab , and the more balanced numbers after COVID-19 related deaths were excluded. 
Nevertheless, it is considered that deaths and other systemic AEs potentially associated with faricimab 
(such as ATE and cerebrovascular haemorrhagic events) need to be monitored in the long-term safety 
studies and in the post-marketing setting. The Applicant will provide regular reports for deaths to the 
EMA on a 6-monthly basis for the initial 3 years post approval. The Agency will also be informed in 
case a signal or pattern is identified between reporting periods. 
APTC events for nAMD and DME indications 
The Applicant has provided a detailed discussion in response to this request to further elaborate on the 
imbalances noted between the DME pivotal trials YOSEMITE and RHINE in relation to APTC-adjudicated 
deaths. The Applicant has also presented data from the published literature for aflibercept and 
ranibizumab which supports the finding that the overall rates of APTC-defined deaths for faricimab sit 
broadly within the ranges for this population. It is considered that Applicant’s response has explored 
the possible reasons for differences in fatal APTC events across the DME phase III pivotal studies and 
this concern is considered resolved. 
This safety issue will be followed through the LTE studies as outlined in the RMP for both indications. 
ATE events have also been added to the RMP as important potential risks. 
Long-term safety studies - nAMD and DME indications 
The long term safety will be followed through the LTE studies as outlined in the RMP. Safety issues 
such as related to bilateral use safety, safety of the Q8W dosing (for nAMD)  and dosing intervals 
shorter than Q8W, sight-threatening adverse events, IOI, serious ocular adverse events, systemic 
events potentially related to faricimab, safety issues identified in ADA positive patients should be 
monitored and presented regularly in the PSUR. 
Bilateral use – DME and nAMD 
In both indications faricimab was administered only unilaterally. No non-clinical or clinical data have 
been generated on the bilateral use, although this was recommended during previous scientific advice 
procedures, as the bilateral treatment is foreseen in the clinical practice for both indications. Moreover, 
patients with bilateral nAMD and DME were included in the pivotal studies, where their fellow eye was 
treated with an anti-VEGF treatment, primarily aflibercept. Data on bilateral treatment with faricimab is 
needed to establish a safe interval between treatments of two eyes. If treatment of both eyes is 
performed in parallel, this could lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could consequently 
increase the risk of systemic adverse events. The SmPC was updated to include that bilateral 
treatment could cause bilateral ocular AEs and/or lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could 
increase the risk of systemic adverse events. Until data for bilateral use become available, this is a 
theoretical risk for faricimab. The applicant proposes to generate further relevant data in relation to 
bilateral use in the ongoing LTE studies. 
Safety profile for the different treatment schedules. 
DME 
The PTI arm comprised a myriad of different individualised treatment schemes, with differences seen 
not only between patients but also within the same patient in the course of treatment. As patients with 
different treatment intervals are pooled together in the PTI arm, safety of individual dosing is not 
discernible i.e. likely better safety profile of longer intervals is obscured by the likely worse safety 
profile of shorter intervals. As a large proportion of AEs of intravitreally administered VEGF-inhibitors 
are injection-related, it is anticipated that a Q4W and Q8W intervals are associated with more adverse 
events compared to a Q12W or Q16W interval, however the safety of different treatment regimens 
(other than Q8W) has not been investigated systematically. As no PTI dose regimen was chosen for 
the comparator, it is difficult to draw conclusions how the faricimab PTI regimen compares to the 
aflibercept Q8W regimen with respect to the safety. Thus, a separate safety analysis was requested for 
patients in faricimab PTI arm who received less versus equal or more administrations in comparison to 
the planned administrations in the fixed Q8W dosing schedule. 
The safety data for the faricimab Q4W dosing interval, albeit limited, indicate a higher risk of both 
ocular and non-ocular adverse events, including higher risk for serious AEs compared to faricimab Q8W 
interval but also compared to aflibercept Q8W dosing regimen. The applicant included in the SmPC 
information that the data in this population is limited.  This should be updated to state that based on 
limited information, dosing intervals shorter than Q8W are associated with a higher risk of ocular and 
systemic adverse events, including serious adverse events. 
nAMD 
Currently, the number of patients followed for the individual treatment schedules remain somewhat 
limited and additional safety data is anticipated from the ongoing pivotal and LTE studies in this 
indication. Of note, the most intense treatment schedule, i.e. Q8W, had the least patients included (i.e. 
n=143 patients for Q8W, n=219 for Q12W and n=289 for Q16W).  
Due to the pooling of distinct treatment schedules (Q8W, Q12W and Q16W after disease assessment at 
weeks 20 and 24) a limited picture of the safety profile is available for each of the applied dose 
regimens, although based on the totality of data, the overall safety profile of faricimab can be 
considered sufficiently characterised and additional data will be generated from the LTE studies. This 
subgroup of patients should be closely monitored in the LTE studies and relevant safety updates should 
be provided within the regular PSURs.  
The majority of patients (42.8%) across both phase III studies was in the ≥75 - <85 year age 
category (mean age in the faricimab arm was 75.4 years and in the aflibercept arm 76.4 years). But, 
slightly more patients are reported for the aflibercept arm in the ≥85 year age category (13.7% in the 
faricimab arm vs. 19.3% in the aflibercept arm), but slightly less patients are reported for the 
aflibercept arm in the ≥65 - <75 year age category (33.4% in the faricimab arm vs. 28.9% in the 
aflibercept arm). More female patients were included in both pivotal studies for both treatment arms 
(around 60% females and 40% males included). An imbalance in patients with >160 systolic or >90 
diastolic blood pressure (11.2% in the faricimab arm vs. 5.2% in the aflibercept arm) is reported for 
the LUCERNE study only. Clinical implications of these imbalances are currently unknown. This 
subgroup of patients should be closely monitored in the LTE studies and relevant safety updates should 
be provided within the regular PSURs. 
Intraocular inflammation and intraocular pressure increased events – DME and nAMD 
indication  
For the DME indication, through Week 56, the incidence of intraocular inflammation events in the study 
eye was slightly higher in both faricimab groups as compared to the aflibercept groups. These events 
were reported in 8 patients [1.3%], 9 patients [1.4%], and 4 patients [0.6%] in the faricimab Q8W, 
faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively. Serious intraocular inflammation events were 
also reported in the faricimab groups. The reason for such imbalances is not clear. This could be a 
chance finding however, taking into consideration a novel mode action of faricimab further discussion 
from the applicant was required.  
For DME, at the time of the final 2-year analysis imbalances were less apparent although still noted. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for any IOI through Week 100 were low (0.88 per 100 PY, 1.38 per 
 
100 PY, and 0.88 per 100 PY, in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab PTI, and aflibercept Q8W arms, 
respectively. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for endophthalmitis through Week 100 were 0.26 per 100 PY and 
0.09 per 100 PY for faricimab and aflibercept, respectively. 
Therefore, cases of IOI should continue to be closely monitored particularly over longer term treatment 
with faricimab and updated safety data presented as data emerges, especially considering the status of 
faricimab as a new active substance with new mode of action. 
Immunogenicity - DME and nAMD indication 
Taking into consideration that ADA-positive patients experienced more SAEs compared to a general 
population, the applicant’s claim that differences observed between ADA-positive and ADA-negative 
patients with respect to incidence of IOI events are not clinically relevant is not fully supported. The 
Applicant considers the clinical relevance is unclear. The SmPC has been updated to reflect the 
available data and this safety issue needs to be closely monitored

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, it is considered that efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of nAMD and DME. The 
favourable effects demonstrated in the pivotal Phase III studies provide evidence on the comparable 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy of faricimab and aflibercept in visual function, anatomical parameters and visual related quality 
of life in patients with nAMD and DME. 
The most frequent ADRs are well-established for approved products administered by IVT injection, 
some are procedural and related to the route of administration.  
As outlined above, the numerical unbalance in deaths has been investigated with several approaches, 
and it is not considered causally attributable to faricimab at this stage. In any case, it is highlighted 
that the overall ocular and non-ocular safety of faricimab, including topics of special interest, will be 
closely monitored in the ongoing safety studies, and in the post-marketing setting. Regular updates on 
ocular and non-ocular safety of faricimab will be provided through the PSUR submissions. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Faricimab is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Vabysmo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vabysmo is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Vabysmo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Vabysmo in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at adequately informing patients/carers on the risks of Vabysmo, 
the key signs and symptoms of those risks, and when to seek urgent attention from their physician 
with the objective to minimize the risks and any resultant complications by encouraging prompt 
intervention. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Vabysmo is marketed, all patients/carers who 
are expected to use Vabysmo have access to/are provided with the following educational package: 
• 
Patient information pack 
The patient information pack consists of the patient information leaflet and a patient/carer guide. The 
patient guide is provided in written and audio format, and will include the following key elements: 
A description of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular 
edema (DME) 
A description of Vabysmo, how it works, and what to expect from Vabysmo treatment 
A description of the key signs and symptoms of the key risks associated with Vabysmo, i.e., 
infectious endophthalmitis and intraocular inflammation 
A description of when to seek urgent attention from the health care provider should signs and 
symptoms of these risks present themselves 
Recommendations for adequate care after the injection 
•  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
A multicenter, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of faricimab in patients with nAMD

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that faricimab is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

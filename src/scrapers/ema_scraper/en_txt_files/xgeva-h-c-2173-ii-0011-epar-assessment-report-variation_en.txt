2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
XGEVA (denosumab)  is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANK Ligand which was approved in 
the European Union for the prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, 
spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumours on 13 
July 2011.   
As part of the current procedure, the MAH initially applied for an extension of indication to add “treatment 
of castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases as determined by 
assessment of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). XGEVA prolongs bone-metastasis-free survival by 
preventing bone metastases”.  
During the procedure, as part of the response to the 2nd CHMP Request for Supplementary Information 
(RSI), the applicant revised the proposed indication to: 
“Delay of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing 
bone metastases based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of 6 months or less”. 
In view of an outstanding major objection regarding clinical efficacy raised by the CHMP during the 
evaluation (see below), the MAH informed the Committee on 27 August 2013 of their decision not to 
pursue the claimed extension of the indication for XGEVA applied for under the present procedure, but 
proposed nevertheless to pursue with the application to enable implementation of the safety-related 
changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet, and the changes to the risk management plan (RMP) that had 
been agreed during the CHMP review.   
The CHMP endorsed the MAH’s proposed way forward at its September 2013 CHMP meeting. Thus, the 
final scope of the application was revised as follows:  
“Type II variation to delete the ADR cellulitis and text describing “skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) 
leading to hospitalisation” from section 4.8 of the SmPC and to delete the associated warning in SmPC 
section 4.4. Further, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with a change in frequency of the ADR 
drug hypersensitivity from uncommon to rare, and with the addition of text describing symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia observed in clinical studies. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to 
update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.”

2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data for denosumab were included and assessed as part of the original 
marketing authorisation application for Xgeva. Some PK data were also collected in study 20050147, 
which is pivotal clinical study included in the present application (see below). 
Concerning biopharmaceutical aspects, the marketed denosumab drug product preparation is a 70 mg/mL 
vial (1.7 mL deliverable volume for a total dose of 120 mg) and the product used in the pivotal study for 
the current application, Study 20050147, consisted of two 1.0-mL SC injections of a 60 mg/mL 
formulation to deliver a 120-mg dose of denosumab.  Study 20060446 compared the pharmacokinetic 
profile of a single 120-mg SC dose of denosumab when administered as the above mentioned 
presentations.  The results demonstrated that denosumab administered as one 120-mg injection 
(supplied from a single vial of 70 mg/mL denosumab) is bioequivalent to denosumab administered as two 
60-mg injections (supplied from two vials of 60 mg/mL denosumab).   
In study 20050147, blood samples for the measurement of serum denosumab concentrations were 
obtained from a subset of approximately 150 subjects before administration of investigational product on 
study day 1, then at weeks 5, 9, 13, 25, 49, 73, and at the end-of-study visit for the blinded treatment 
phase.  
One hundred three subjects were enrolled in the substudy, of which 46 subjects received denosumab and 
57 subjects placebo. Of the 46 subjects who received denosumab, 40 had serum denosumab 
concentrations assessed at baseline, 1 of whom (2.5%) had a quantifiable denosumab concentration for 
unknown reasons (30.137 ng/mL). 
Trough serum denosumab concentrations (i.e. from samples obtained at the end of the SC dosing 
interval) are summarized in the figure below. The median trough serum denosumab concentration at the 
1-month (week 5) visit was 6890 ng/mL. Exposures, based on trough serum concentrations, increased as 
anticipated, with approximately 2- to 2.5-fold higher median serum concentrations (15600 ng/mL) 
observed at month 6 (week 25). Median trough serum denosumab concentrations obtained at weeks 49 
to 73 were similar (range 16900 to 14100 ng/mL).

For the initially proposed extended indication, the proposed posology for XGEVA was the same as the 
currently approved posology. The PK data provided in study 20050147 is mainly descriptive and no 
formal population PK analysis has been made. However, the results obtained are consistent with results 
obtained in other indications and no relevant differences are expected. In the original CHMP assessment 
report for the initial XGEVA marketing authorisation application, it was concluded that disease status (i.e. 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, other solid tumours) does not markedly affect the pharmacokinetic profile 
of denosumab. 
Concerning the use of different formulations/presentations for commercial use and in the clinical pivotal 
study, study 20060446 showed bioequivalence between the 60 and 70 mg/mL formulations when 
administered as a 120-mg dose. This study was also included in the original XGEVA marketing 
authorisation application and assessed in the corresponding CHMP assessment report and will therefore 
not be further discussed here. 
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that the pharmacokinetic data provided are sufficient.  
2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Men with non-metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) will eventually develop clinically 
apparent metastatic disease, particularly to bone. Previous studies of bone-targeted agents in men with 
non-metastatic CRPC have failed to demonstrate significant improvement in delaying bone metastasis. 
These studies investigated clodronate (in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer) and zoledronic acid (in 
CRPC), as well as the endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan (in CRPC).  A study with another 
endothelin receptor antagonist, zibotentan, in patients with CRPC without bone metastases was recently 
terminated for lack of efficacy in 2011.  
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL and binds with high affinity (Kd 3 x 10-
12 M) and specificity to the soluble and cell membrane-bound forms of human RANKL. Binding to RANKL 
prevents RANK activation and inhibits the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts. As a result, 
denosumab is effective for prevention of “skeletal related events” in men with metastatic CRPC.    
Pivotal study 
Study 20050147 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Center (319), international, Phase 3 Study of 
Denosumab on Prolonging Bone Metastasis-Free Survival in Men with Hormone-Refractory Prostate 
Cancer. 
Study period; 03 February 2006 (date that the first subject was enrolled) to 30 July 2010 (primary 
analysis data cut-off date). 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility: Histologically-confirmed, CRPC who were chemically or 
surgically castrated and had a total serum testosterone level of < 50 ng/dl, a high risk for development of 
bone metastasis (PSA value ≥8.0 ng/mL no more than 3 months before randomization OR PSA doubling 
time ≤10 months), an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ function, no metastases to 
bone or other organs (except lymph nodes) (central confirmation), and no prior exposure to intravenous 
bisphosphonates. 
Subjects were randomized (IVRS) in a 1:1 ratio to receive 120 mg denosumab or placebo subcutaneously 
once every 4 weeks.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/661174/2013 
Page 5/35 
  
  
The randomization scheme was stratified based on PSA criteria (PSA level ≥8.0 ng/mL AND PSA doubling 
time ≤10.0 months [yes/no]) and previous or current chemotherapy for prostate cancer (yes/no).  
Number of Subjects Enrolled: A total of 1435 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of these subjects, 718 
were randomized to receive denosumab.  
Prior to unblinding, the decision was made to exclude subjects from all analyses when institutional review 
board (IRB) review activities and oversight were not ensured. Two subjects randomized to denosumab 
and 1 subject randomized to placebo met this criterion 
Blinding: To maintain the integrity of the blind, the following parameters were concealed from 
investigators and sponsor personnel involved in conducting the study and managing the database: 
alkaline phosphatase, bone turnover markers, serum denosumab concentrations, and antidenosumab 
antibody levels. 
It was strongly recommended that subjects take oral supplements of calcium and vitamin D throughout 
the study. 
Primary endpoint: Bone metastasis free survival. 
Full body radio-isotope bone scan were required every 16 weeks. Newly-occurring bone metastases were 
assessed as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
If the central reader identified any change from baseline on a radioisotope bone scan, an x-ray, CT, 
or MRI  scan of the area in question was obtained.  Bone scan changes alone  were not acceptable as 
sole evidence for scoring newly developed bone metastasis. 
If  only  an  x-ray  was  performed  and  was  inconclusive  as  to  the  cause  of  the  change,  additional 
radiological information was required. This additional information could be initiated by the investigator 
or requested by the central reader and consisted of either a CT or an MRI scan. 
If the central reader confirmed bone metastasis, the subject was not to receive any additional doses 
of investigational product.  
The subject completed end of study visit assessments within 4 weeks of confirmation of bone metastasis 
and the subject entered the follow-up phase. 
The objective to delay the occurrence of bone metastases in patients considered to be at high risk is 
clinically appropriate, the relevance obviously pending on the magnitude of the treatment effect.  
In relation to an ‘other concern’ raised by the CHMP during the procedure, it was discussed whether the 
treatment effect as estimated by isotope scan or CT, is a measure of occurrence of metastases or a 
measure of the effects of metastases on osteoblast activation (isotope scan) or bone lesions 
(osteoclasts).  
A delay in evolution of bone metastases would be expected to result in some degree of inhibition of PSA 
evolution. This, however, is not the case. As inhibition of osteoclast activation by blockade of RANKL is 
likely also to result in inhibition of osteblast activation, it is concluded that the primary endpoint is a 
measure of delay in detection of bone metastases.  
Secondary Efficacy: 
Time to first bone metastasis (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) excluding death; 
• 
•  Overall survival time.

The external DMC convened approximately twice yearly to monitor unblinded safety and efficacy data.  
It was recognized that the DMC may have felt ethically compelled to recommend early stopping in the 
event of overwhelming efficacy. 
The rules for stopping the study were defined as follows: 
For the formal interim analysis conducted when approximately 330 subjects developed bone metastasis 
or died, the critical p-values for rejecting the null hypothesis (p<0.00135) and rejecting the alternative 
hypothesis (p>0.295), as determined by Lan-DeMets spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming 
approach. 
At other interim evaluations, the DMC focused on safety and only reviewed efficacy data to balance the 
risk:benefit assessment. At these analyses, the DMC should have considered recommending study 
termination due to overwhelming evidence of efficacy only if the p-value for the primary efficacy analysis 
was < 0.0005.  
The study was allowed to continue to its planned final efficacy analysis and the DMC did not recommend 
any changes to the conduct of the study. 
The original protocol was approved on 22 November 2005 and was subsequently amended 3 times. None 
of these amendments threatened the integrity of the study. The final SAP was dated 02 November 2010. 
Of note, denosumab is currently licensed for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer and bone 
metastases. Denosumab (and placebo), however, was stopped when bone metastasis was diagnosed.  
This might be questioned from a clinical perspective as a meaningful clinical question would be if early 
treatment of patients at risk is favourable from a benefit-risk perspective compared with initiation of 
treatment at time of diagnosis of bone metastasis. When the study was initiated (2006), however, XGEVA 
was not licensed (authorised in 2011); thus conventional treatment with bisphosphonates was initiated as 
clinically warranted.  
The overall design of the study is thus considered acceptable.

2.3.2.  Results 
Reasons for study discontinuation 
A rather high proportion of patients discontinued the study due to “consent withdrawn” prior to cut-off 
date. However, there are no major imbalances between study arms. It is not clear to what extent patients 
were followed for bone metastasis after study medication was stopped. 
Censoring: In the subgroup of primary interest, i.e. those with PSA doubling time (DT) < 6 months, 36% 
on denosumab vs. 26% on placebo discontinued the study prior to the primary data analysis cut-off.  
Sensitivity analyses using a model-based multiple imputation method were conducted to explore the 
potential effect of these early discontinuations on the primary analysis results in this subgroup.  
If it is conservatively assumed that patients discontinuing the study had an increased risk of bone 
metastases of HR 1.2 and would have had a smaller benefit if continued on therapy, HR 1.0, then the HR 
in the subgroup of patients with PSA doubling time of <6 months would be 0.83 (p=0.03). 
Baseline Demographics 
White/Caucasians dominated the study population.

Baseline Characteristics 
The study population appears representative of patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. There 
are no imbalances between study arms likely to be of any relevance.

Primary Endpoint, Bone Metastases-free Survival 
At an event rate of about 50%, the HR is 0.85 at a p-value of 0.03, i.e. borderline. The median 
difference, about 4 months, observed after about 2 years of treatment appears to overestimate the 
treatment effect.

Page 10/35 
  
  
 
 
Subgroup analyses    
The treatment effect appears reasonably consistent in most sufficiently large subgroups and appears 
better in those administered prior chemotherapy.  
“Dual risk” refers to PSA level ≥8.0 ng/mL AND PSA doubling time ≤10.0 months PSA. Note that the HRs 
are rather similar comparing dual vs. single risk.  
Prior chemotherapy and “dual risk” were stratification factors. Note that the treatment effect was no 
longer statistically significant if patients (about 8%) with prior chemotherapy are excluded.

The relative treatment effect appears larger in terms of time to symptomatic metastases, but the crude 
incidences are low. Of note, osteoclast inhibition by bisphosphonates is known to reduce pain in patients 
with overt bone metastases. Thus improved activity is expected in terms of time to symptomatic 
metastasis compared with time to detection of metastasis.  
There are no trends in either direction in terms of survival.

PSA change from baseline appears similar in both treatment groups. PSA would have been expected to 
increase prior to diagnosis of bone metastasis, i.e. opening for showing a difference between treatment 
arms even though patients were not followed after detection of bone metastasis. The treatment effect, 
however, is small in terms of bone metastasis free survival and variability might obscure differences.

Ad hoc: Subject incidence of first major osteoporotic fracture (i.e. a clinical vertebral, hip, forearm, or 
humerus fracture not associated with a metastatic fracture, regardless of trauma severity) was 1.1% 
(denosumab) and 2.8% (placebo) groups, hazard ratio [95% CI] of 0.38 [0.17, 0.86]; p-value = 0.0202. 
There was no statistically significant treatment effect in predefined fracture endpoints, but HRs are similar 
to bone metastasis free survival.   
On-study anti-neoplastic therapy 
ADT= androgen deprivation therapy, OX=orchextomy 
There are no imbalances of likely importance in the use of on-study anti-cancer therapy.  
Overrunning patients 
After the primary analysis data cut-off date, subjects continued to receive double-blind treatment until 
the completion of the efficacy and safety analyses. 
Three hundred sixty-two subjects (50.6%) who received denosumab and 388 subjects (54.2%) who 
received placebo developed a bone metastasis or died by the end of the extended blinded treatment 
phase. At time of the primary analysis, corresponding figures were 46.8% and 51.7%, respectively.    
The hazard ratio (95% CI) for bone metastasis free survival was 0.88 (0.76, 1.01; p = 0.0704).   
With respect to time to first bone metastasis, the hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.73, 1.00; 
p = 0.0517).   
Seventy-three subjects (10.2%) who received denosumab and 98 subjects (13.7%) who received placebo 
developed a symptomatic bone metastasis.  The hazard ratio (95% CI) for symptomatic bone metastasis 
was 0.70 (0.52, 0.95; p = 0.0207).  
Of note, when overrunning patients are included, the difference in terms of the primary endpoint is no 
longer statistically significant at the 5% level.   
Additional Post Hoc Efficacy Analyses for Study 20050147 
The availability of baseline PSA kinetics afforded an opportunity to further investigate the relationship 
between PSA kinetics and efficacy parameters.

Relative Risk for Bone Metastasis-free Survival Over Prostate-specific Antigen Doubling Time 
in Placebo Group (Study 20050147 Full Analysis Set) 
A relationship between PSA doubling time and risk of progression is expected and has repeatedly been 
reported previously.  
When the analysis is restricted to subjects in Study 20050147 who were at risk based solely on PSA 
doubling time (i.e. excluding patients solely enrolled based on PSA value ≥8.0 ng/mL), the increase in the 
slope of the risk curve is less pronounced.  
Because the subjects in Study 20050147 with PSA doubling times > 10 months were still at high risk for 
bone metastasis based on absolute PSA, the risk curve did not further decrease for longer PSA doubling 
times.

(Subjects With Doubling Time ≤ 10 Months in Full Analysis Set) 
The selection of the PSA doubling time cut-off >< 6months is supported by data external to the study.  
Approximately 60% of the entire study population had a PSA doubling time ≤ 6 months (N = 846). There 
were no likely relevant differences between treatment groups in baseline factors between treatment arms 
in this subpopulation.

b  denosumab median time – placebo median time 
c  Hazard ratio or rate ratio < 1 favors denosumab. 
d  p-values are adjusted for covariates. 
The absolute treatment effect appears larger in this post hoc subgroup analysis due to at least two 
factors: the increased risk of bone metastases and an apparently increased relative activity of 
denosumab. In the FAS the medians for bone metastasis free survival were about 26 months (placebo) 
and 30 months (denosumab), vs. about 19 and 26 in this subpopulation. 
If the efficacy analyses are focused on patients with PSA doubling time ≤ 10 Months, i.e. excluding 
patients enrolled only due to PSA ≥8.0 ng/mL, the bone metastases-free survival is 0.77 (95% CI 0.64; 
0.93) in patients with PSA doubling time ≤6 months and 1.13 (95% CI 0.81; 1.57) in those with PSA 
doubling time >6 months.  
To some degree, the apparent increase in relative activity in patients with short PSA doubling time is 
related to competing risks, however, the difference is considered too large to be explained by this. There 
are no external data supporting the notion that denosumab is more active in patients with short PSA 
doubling time. The credibility of this finding is thus strongly questioned.  
Patient-reported Outcome  
At study entry, pain severity was low and HRQOL assessments indicated high levels of HRQOL. During the 
study, increases in pain were relatively modest and generally similar between the denosumab and 
placebo groups.  As expected no significant differences were observed between the treatment groups in

treatment groups. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
Design: Even though it is fully understood why study therapy was stopped when bone metastases were 
detected, and the study design is accepted, it is nevertheless of clinical importance to know whether early 
therapy in “the long run” is favourable to the initiation of therapy at the time of clinically overt bone 
metastasis.  
Another issue is whether progression on therapy signifies some degree of resistance to denosumab, i.e. 
whether osteoclast activation is achieved through other means than RANKL. Alternative mechanisms to 
RANKL activation of osteoclasts do exist and thus it would be of interest to undertake a study designed to 
address this issue, e.g. through a randomised cross-over to a bisphosphonate vs. maintained denosumab 
in patients with progression on denosumab.      
Statistical robustness: “Early treatment” of patients with prostate cancer at risk of bone metastases is not 
a simple case of extrapolation as there are failed trials with bisphosphonates. Thus p-values considerably 
lower than 5% in a single pivotal trial would normally be required to support the proposed new indication. 
In this case the p-value was 0.03 at the primary analyses; when overrunning patients were included 
0.07. Furthermore, if patients pre-treated with chemotherapy (about 8%) are excluded, the treatment 
effect is no longer statistically significant.  
During the procedure, the MAH has restricted the proposed indication to patients with PSA doubling time 
≤6 months. Therefore the robustness and the validity of the subgroup results are of key importance, not 
the results in the FAS population.     
Magnitude of the treatment effect, FAS: After more than 2 years of treatment, the incidence of bone 
metastasis is reduced with less than 5% at an overall level of about 45% corresponding to a HR of 0.85 in 
terms of bone metastasis free survival. This must be regarded as a modest treatment effect. 
Subgroup analysis: Patients with PSA doubling time ≤6 months were identified post hoc as patients 
deriving more benefit. The MAH has reviewed and reported the results of other CRPC studies and also 
reported the use of PSA ><6 months as a stratification factor in current studies and based on this data it 
is cautiously concluded that there is sufficient external support for this cut-off defining a subgroup at 
increased risk. 
Magnitude of the treatment effect in patients with PSA doubling time ≤6 months: The reported bone 
metastasis-free HR is 0.77 (p=0.006) corresponding to a crude difference of about 10% (57% vs. 47%) 
after a median treatment time of about 1½ years. This, however, most likely constitutes an overestimate 
of the treatment effect.   
In the complementary group of patients, i.e. those with a PSA doubling time of >6 months and less than 
10 months, the bone metastasis-free HR is 1.13 (95% CI 0.81; 1.57). This per se is not considered to be 
a likely outcome and is therefore considered an indication of an overestimation of the treatment effect in 
the target population.  
Whilst increased relative activity in patients with short PSA doubling time certainly is a possibility, there is 
no external data related to denosumab supporting this notion.  
In addition, more patients in the denosumab arm withdrew prior to meeting the endpoint, 36% vs. 26%. 
If it is conservatively assumed that patients discontinuing the study had an increased risk of bone 
metastases of HR 1.2 and would have had smaller benefit if continued on therapy, HR 1.0, then the HR in 
the subgroup of patients with PSA doubling time of <6 months would be 0.83 (p=0.03).

Interaction between denosumab and bone scanning: Bone scans do not detect cancer lesions, but 
osteoblast activation. Bone metastases leads to a vicious circle of osteclast and osteoblast activation 
where denosumab inhibits osteoclast activation. Hypothetically, inhibition of osteoclast activation might 
lead to reduced osteoblast activation, thereby delaying positive findings on bone scans.  
Due to the small treatment effect (HR 0.85, bone metastases free survival) none of the experiments 
undertaken can address this issue.  
In conclusion, this submission for an extended indication to encompass patients with CRPC is based on a 
single pivotal trial. In the ITT population, the treatment effect is small and the results are not considered 
robustly documented from a statistical perspective. 
Post hoc a subgroup of patients was identified with apparent increased benefit of therapy. Most likely, 
however, the benefit of therapy is overestimated and thus a proper benefit – risk assessment cannot be 
undertaken.

There appears to be no between study consistency as regards these signals.  
“Urinary retention”: based on available data and further analyses, it is concluded that there is no need to 
revise the SmPC in this regard. 
“Cardiovascular disorder”: based on available data there is no need to amend the SmPC, section 4.8 in 
this regard. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Hypocalcaemia: The event rate was, as expected, lower in the pivotal study for this submission, about 
1.5% vs. about 10% in patients with bone metastatic disease. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Adverse events considered as potential cases of ONJ were identified using a 
broad search strategy and sent for adjudication by independent experts blinded to treatment allocation. 
Baseline oral/dental condition was assessed for each subject before enrolment and recorded in the case 
report form.  A visual examination of the oral cavity was conducted every 6 months.  
Number of adjudicated cases of ONJ:  Placebo:  
0 
Denosumab:   33 (4.6%) 
When adjusted for exposure, the rates of ONJ were similar across studies (0147, 0103 and 
0136/0244/0103 combined).

Source Data: d09css.aae, d09css.aslinfo, paadam.aae, paadam.aslinfo
At about three years the incidence of ONJ is about 10-12%, ONJ grade 3 and above about 2-3% and 
finally 4-6% non-resolved events and there are no signs of reaching a plateau yet.    
Although the incidence of ONJ is considerable it is in line with what would have been expected from 
previous trials. Of the 33 ONJ cases, no subjects presented with grade 4 or 5 events, 10 with grade 3 
events, 16 with grade 2 events, and 7 with grade 1 events. Ten of these events required no surgical 
treatments; 21 required surgical treatments limited in nature (i.e. sequestrectomy, debridement, and 
curettage); and 2 subjects had bone resection. No notable impact of ONJ on subject-reported pain or 
HRQOL has been reported. By end of data capture resolution of ONJ has been documented for 13 (39%) 
subjects.  
Infections: Due to putatively relevant inhibition of monocytes and antigen presenting cells, infectious 
events are of special interest. 
Serious Adverse Events, Infections and Infestations 
In all studies there seems to be a slightly higher incidence in the denosumab arms. With respect to 
opportunistic infections, no pattern indicative of increased risk was identified, but the number of cases is 
low. With respect to tuberculosis, e.g. there was only one single case (denosumab arm).

Adverse Events, Infections and Infestations 
Also here there appears to be a slightly higher overall incidence in denosumab arms. Apart from 
bronchitis and influenza as discussed previously, consistency between studies is seen (at a low level) only 
for sinusitis. Due to type of infections and obvious multiplicity issues, no further action is considered 
indicated at this point in time.   
Skin infections: In the currently approved SmPC the following is stated in section 4.4:  
“Skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) leading to hospitalisation  
In three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, 
skin infections leading to hospitalisation (predominantly cellulitis) were reported more frequently in 
patients receiving XGEVA (0.9%) compared with zoledronic acid (0.7%).  
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, skin infections leading to hospitalisation were reported for 
0.4% women receiving Prolia (denosumab 60 mg every 6 months) and for 0.1% women receiving 
placebo (see section 4.4). ” 
The MAH proposed to delete this paragraph from the SmPC as well as “Cellulites” in 4.8 where it is 
reported in the frequency category “uncommon”. Given the totality of the data this is acceptable.

Adverse Events of Skin Infections 
Altogether, the totality of data does not indicate that there is an increased risk in denusomab treated 
patients.   
Malignancies: For the same reasons, malignancies are of special interest.  
There is no overall increase and with respect to individual tumours no pattern of significance was noticed.  
Hypersensitivity reactions: In the current SmPC “drug hypersensitivity” is reported as “uncommon”, a 
category proposed to be changed to “rare”.

Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse Events 
In the current study, fourteen (3.3%) subjects in the denosumab group and 10 (2.4%) subjects in the 
placebo group had adverse events potentially associated with hypersensitivity. The most common 
adverse events potentially associated with hypersensitivity reported for subjects in either group were 
urticaria (5 [1.2%] denosumab, 1 [0.2%] placebo), drug hypersensitivity (1 [0.2%], 3 [0.7%]), face 
oedema (2 [0.5%], 0), hypersensitivity (1 [0.2%], 1 [0.2%]), swelling face (1 [0.2%], 1 [0.2%]), 
anaphylactic reaction (1 [0.2%], 1 [0.2%]), and eye swelling (1 [0.2%], 2 [0.5%]). 
For the 4 subjects (1 denosumab and 3 placebo) with an adverse event with the preferred term of drug 
hypersensitivity, the corresponding verbatim term indicated that the event was associated with other 
drugs (i.e., chemotherapy and antibiotics (cephalexin and clindamycin)). 
An individualised causality assessment undertaken indicates that a change from uncommon to rare is 
justified.

Preferred terms are sorted by descending order of frequency in the denosumab group in Study 
20050147 and coded using MedDRA Version 13.1. 
Due to the apparent increase in events of cardiac ischemia, independent adjudication was also 
undertaken.  
Autoimmune Disorders: This group of disorders has not been categorized as being of special interest 
by the MAH. A thorough assessment of all possible entries has not been undertaken, but thyroid disorder, 
mainly thyroiditis (hypo-, hyper-), might serve screening purposes as thyroiditis is frequently reported 
e.g. in relation to alpha interferon treatment.

It is concluded that there is currently no strong evidence to support that denosumab acts as an immune 
modulating agent in adult animals or humans. It is also agreed that that the number of events of hyper- 
or hypothyroidism is low and in some cases confounded. It is concluded that “high dose” denosumab 
might be associated with an increased event rate of thyroid disorders.  
Safety in patients with PSA doubling time ≤ 6 months 
Overall, the safety profile in this subpopulation was similar to the FAS. 
2.4.3.  Discussion 
The safety profile of denosumab remains essentially stable and the overall differences in incidences of 
adverse events between the denosumab and placebo arm are small.  
However, of the AEs considered by investigators related to study medication, serious AEs and AEs leading 
to study discontinuation occurred more frequently with denosumab. To a large extent this refers to ONJ 
and at about three years the incidence is about 10-12%, grade 3 and above about 2-3 % and there are 
no signs of reaching a plateau yet. Of the 33 ONJ cases no subjects presented with grade 4 or 5 events, 
10 (30.3%) with grade 3 events, 16 (48.5%) with grade 2 events, and 7 (21.2%) with grade 1 events. 
Ten (30%) of these events required no surgical treatments; 21 (64%) required surgical treatments 
limited in nature; and 2 subjects had bone resection. No notable impact of ONJ on subject-reported pain 
or HRQOL has been reported. By end of data capture resolution of ONJ has been documented for 13 
(39%) subjects. 
Quantitatively, and as expected, events of hypocalcaemia were fewer in patients at risk for bone 
metastasis compared with those with established bone involvement.     
The SmPC and Package Leaflet will be updated to include ‘muscle spasm’.   
There are signals as regards thyroiditis and the RMP has been updated accordingly.  
The MAH requested removal of skin infections/cellulitis from sections 4.4 and 4.8, which is acceptable 
given the totality of data available.  
There is currently no clear signal as regards CV events. However in Study 20050147 there was a clear 
imbalance in myocardial ischemia (6 subjects who received denosumab, no subjects who received 
placebo). The totality of data, however, does not indicate that 4.8 should be revised at present. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The identified risk of skin infection leading to hospitalisation has been deleted, whilst infection remains as 
potential risk. 
Thyroid function disorders have been added on request from CHMP. 
Overall, there are only minor amendments to the latest agreed version of the RMP as a consequence of 
variation II/11 and the safety-related changes implemented in the SmPC and package Leaflet. These 
changes are considered non-controversial and can thus be agreed. 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
In view of an outstanding major objection raised by the CHMP during the evaluation, the MAH informed 
the CHMP on 27 August 2013 of their decision not to pursue the claimed extension of the indication for 
XGEVA applied for under the present procedure, but proposed nevertheless to pursue with the application 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/661174/2013 
Page 30/35 
  
  
to enable implementation of the safety-related changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet, and the 
changes to the risk management plan (RMP) that had been agreed during the CHMP review.   
The CHMP endorsed the MAH’s proposed way forward at its September 2013 CHMP meeting. Thus, the 
final scope of the application was revised as follows:  
“Type II variation to delete the ADR cellulitis and text describing “skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) 
leading to hospitalisation” from section 4.8 of the SmPC and to delete the associated warning in SmPC 
section 4.4. Further, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with a change in frequency of the ADR 
drug hypersensitivity from uncommon to rare, and with the addition of text describing symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia observed in clinical studies. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet and 
to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.” 
These following changes to the product information were agreed as part of the present variation 
application:  
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
Section 4.4:  
Skin infections leading to hospitalisation (predominantly cellulitis) 
In clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, skin infections leading to 
hospitalisation (predominantly cellulitis) were reported (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to 
seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of cellulitis.

Hypocalcaemia 
In three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, 
hypocalcaemia was reported in 9.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 5.0% of patients treated with 
zoledronic acid.  
A grade 3 decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 2.5% of patients treated with XGEVA and 
1.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid.  A grade 4 decrease in serum calcium levels was 
experienced in 0.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid 
(see section 4.4). 
Symptoms of hypocalcaemia in clinical studies included paresthesias or muscle stiffness, twitching, 
spasms and muscle cramps.

…………. 
Skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) leading to hospitalisation 
In three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, 
skin infections leading to hospitalisation (predominantly cellulitis) were reported more frequently in 
patients receiving XGEVA (0.9%) compared with zoledronic acid (0.7%).   
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, skin infections leading to hospitalisation were reported for 
0.4% women receiving Prolia (denosumab 60 mg every 6 months) and for 0.1% women receiving 
placebo (see section 4.4). 
Package Leaflet 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity make editorial changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet and 
to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet, which is 
acceptable. 
All the changes above were agreed by the CHMP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually develop bone metastases and 
skeletal complications. Denosumab is currently licensed for the prevention of skeletal related events 
(SRE) in patients with solid tumours and known bone metastases. 
As part of the current procedure, the MAH initially applied for an extension of indication to add “treatment 
of castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases as determined by 
assessment of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). XGEVA prolongs bone-metastasis-free survival by 
preventing bone metastases”.  
During the procedure, as part of the response to the 2nd CHMP Request for Supplementary Information 
(RSI), the applicant revised the proposed indication to: 
“Delay of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing 
bone metastases based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of 6 months or less”. 
Pivotal for this application is a placebo controlled study conducted in patients with CRPC at increased risk 
for bone metastases based PSA levels ≥8.0 ng/ml or PSA doubling time ≤10 months. As the study was 
initiated prior to the authorisation of XGEVA for prevention of SRE, study therapy was stopped at the time 
of diagnosis of bone metastasis. Thus, the benefit of early therapy vs. initiation of therapy at the time of 
overt bone metastasis cannot not be assessed. The primary endpoint was bone metastasis free survival. 
Benefit 
After a median duration of therapy of more than 2 years the absolute benefit in terms of patients free of 
metastasis was about 5% at an overall level of about 45%. In terms of HR the point estimate was 0.85. 
The median difference was about 4 months.   
Standard subgroup analyses show essentially the same treatment effect, including the stratification factor 
PSA ≥8.0 ng/ml AND PSA doubling time ≤10 months (yes/no). In patients with prior chemotherapy 
(stratification factor) results look more promising.  
In a post hoc defined subgroup of patients encompassing about 60% of patients enrolled with a PSA 
doubling time of ≤6 months, the HR was 0.77 and the difference in crude incidence of bone metastasis 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/661174/2013 
Page 32/35 
  
  
was about 10% at an overall incidence of about 50% after about median 1½ year of therapy. The median 
difference appears to overestimate the treatment effect, but was about 7 months. 
No benefit in terms of survival (HR 1.0) or symptoms based on PRO was demonstrated, but time to 
symptomatic bone metastasis was improved HR 0.67 in the FAS, crude incidence 13.4% vs. 9.6%. This 
possibly relates to the pain reducing effect of osteoclast inhibition.  
Uncertainties 
 “Early treatment” of patients with prostate cancer at high risk for bone metastasis is not a simple case of 
extrapolation based on documented efficacy in patients with overt bone metastases as there are failed 
trials with bisphosphonates. A p-value clearly lower than 5%, if derived from a single pivotal trial, would 
thus be required to support the proposed new indication from a biostatistical perspective. In this case, the 
p-value was 0.03 at the primary analyses and when overrunning patients were included, 0.07. In 
addition, the results were no longer statistically significant when the small group of patients (8%) with 
prior chemotherapy was excluded.  
It is acknowledged that the apparent treatment effect is better (HR 0.77, at a p-value of 0.006) in 
patients with a PSA doubling time of ≤6 months, but it represents the results of post hoc analyses. The 
cut off for PSA doubling-time was defined in retrospect and the risk curve for bone metastases derived 
from the current study shows a steep increase around this cut-off. While a relationship between PSA 
doubling time and risk is expected, the very steep increase is unexpected and in need of external support 
to be considered credible. 
The cut-off ><6 months is cautiously considered sufficiently supported by external data. There is, 
however, no external support for the notion that denosumab shows higher activity in patients with more 
aggressive disease; HR 0.77 vs. 1.13, <6 months vs. >6 months.  It was also noticed that the censoring 
rate was clearly higher in the denosumab arm in this sub-group (36% vs. 26%). Altogether, available 
data indicate that the reported treatment effect (HR 0.77) is overestimated.    
Risk 
Denosumab is well tolerated in the vast majority of patients.  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), however, is a concern. In the current study about 5% of the patients in 
the denosumab arm were affected, i.e. essentially the same incidence per year of therapy as in other 
cancer studies. Also the severity of the events appears to be the same. Of the 33 subjects with positively 
adjudicated ONJ in the current study, no subjects presented with CTCAE grade 4 or 5 events, 10 subjects 
presented with grade 3 events (interfering with daily life), 16 subjects with grade 2 events, and 7 
subjects with grade 1 events (asymptomatic). As in other studies, no impact on scheduled assessment of 
pain (BPI-SF) was observed.  
From a clinical practice viewpoint, at about three years the incidence of ONJ is about 10-12%, grade 3 
and above about 2-3 % and there are no signs of reaching a plateau yet. 
In the current population, cases of hypocalcaemia were fewer than in patients with overt bone 
metastasis, about 1.5% vs. about 10%.  
Uncertainties 
Due to the mechanism of action some event types are followed more closely including infections and 
malignancies. In this submission a possible increase in thyroid disorder was noticed and may be related 
to activation of autoimmune disorders. The RMP has been updated accordingly. 
Benefit – Risk conclusion 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/661174/2013 
Page 33/35 
  
  
In the full study population, the treatment effect in terms of bone metastasis-free survival has not been 
convincingly documented statistically. Furthermore, the apparent treatment effect is modest. Thus 
available data make attempts to undertake a thorough benefit – risk assessment futile in the full study 
population.  
In the post hoc identified subgroup where the apparent benefit of treatment is improved without signs of 
increased treatment related risks, the lack of external data supporting the notion that the activity of 
denosumab is increased, constitutes a major concern.       
In conclusion, altogether the benefit – risk balance in the proposed new indication has not been shown to 
be favourable. Therefore, following the assessment of all available data the CHMP adopted the following 
major objection to be addressed by the MAH in writing and at an oral explanation: 
“This submission for an extended indication to encompass patients with CRPC is based on a single pivotal 
trial. In the ITT population, the treatment effect is small and the results are not considered robustly 
documented from a statistical perspective. 
Post hoc a subgroup of patients was identified with apparent increased benefit of therapy. Most likely, 
however, the benefit of therapy is overestimated and may not outweigh the risk of ONJ and thus a proper 
benefit – risk assessment cannot be undertaken.”  
In view of the outstanding major objection above, the MAH informed the CHMP on 27 August 2013 of 
their decision not to pursue the claimed extension of the indication for XGEVA applied for under the 
present procedure, but proposed nevertheless to pursue with the application to enable implementation of 
the safety-related changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet, and the consequential changes to the risk 
management plan (RMP) that had been agreed during the CHMP review.   
The CHMP endorsed the MAH’s proposed way forward at its September 2013 CHMP meeting. Thus, the 
final scope of the application was revised as follows:  
“Type II variation to delete the ADR cellulitis and text describing “skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) 
leading to hospitalisation” from section 4.8 of the SmPC and to delete the associated warning in SmPC 
section 4.4. Further, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with a change in frequency of the ADR 
drug hypersensitivity from uncommon to rare, and with the addition of text describing symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia observed in clinical studies. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to 
update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.” 
Following the final revision of the scope of the application, the CHMP concluded that the proposed safety-
related changes to the SmPC, Package Leaflet and RMP can be agreed. The benefit/risk balance for 
XGEVA remains positive in the already approved indication: 
“Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or 
surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumours.”

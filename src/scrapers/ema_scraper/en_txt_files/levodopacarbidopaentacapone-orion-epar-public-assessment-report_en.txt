2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This marketing authorisation application for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
(levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) has been submitted by Orion Corporation as an informed consent 
application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. 
The MAH (Orion Corporation) for Stalevo, which was authorised on 17 October 2003, provided consent 
to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier of this 
authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion medicinal 
product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Stalevo. The 
application for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion concerns the identical strengths and pack sizes 
to those approved for Stalevo and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion 
can be found in the Stalevo CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR) published on the EMA website.   
The approved indication is: 
“Stalevo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose 
motor fluctuations not stabilised on levodopa/dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor treatment.” 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Stalevo application, the quality data in support of 
the Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of 
the Stalevo dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing 
procedures). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Stalevo application, the non-clinical data in support 
of the Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of 
the Stalevo dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing 
procedures). 
The ERA provided for this application consists of an adequate justification for the absence of specific 
study data. The medicinal product subject to this application is intended to be administered at 
comparable dose levels and for indications that are already approved in the European Community for 
the reference product Stalevo. Based on the assumption that the product is intended to substitute for 
identical products on the market, the approval of the referred product should not result in an increase 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
Assessment report 
Page 5/7
 
 
 
 
 
of the total quantity of the active ingredients released into the environment. Therefore, it should not 
result in any increase of the risk to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Stalevo application, the clinical data in support of 
the  Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  the 
Stalevo dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of 
the medicinal product subject to this application is well established. No safety concerns requiring risk 
minimisation activities have been identified for Stalevo. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
2.6.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The applicant has enclosed the user testing report performed for the combined Package Leaflet (PL) of 
Stalevo 50/12.5/200 mg, 100/25/200 mg and 150/37.5/200 film-coated tablets. The PL version tested 
was the PL submitted in connection with Stalevo renewal application (EMEA/H/C/511/R/040). The 
conducted readability testing was considered acceptable in CHMP opinion (EMEA/498045/2008) on 25 
September 2008. Since the proposed PL for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion will be identical 
with the Stalevo PL except for the product-specific information, no further testing is warranted. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Since this application has been submitted by Orion Corporation as an informed consent application to 
Stalevo in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the CHMP considered that 
the benefit-risk balance of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg, 75 
mg/18.75 mg/200 mg, 100 mg/25 mg/200 mg, 125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg, 150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg 
and 200 mg/50 mg/200 mg film-coated tablets was favourable and therefore recommended the 
granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication: 
“Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilised on levodopa/dopa decarboxylase 
(DDC) inhibitor treatment. “

4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion in the treatment of Parkinson’s 
disease is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumococcal disease (PD). Clinical manifestations of pneumococcal 
disease include invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-invasive disease. Invasive pneumococcal 
disease is defined as the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site and can lead to 
meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia, and septic arthritis. The non-invasive disease 
can present as, e.g. acute otitis media, sinusitis and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
V114 is proposed to be indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, 
pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks 
through 17 years of age (prior to 18th birthday). 
Epidemiology  
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) continues to be a major cause of vaccine preventable PD 
worldwide with considerable morbidity and mortality, in infants, children, and adults, despite the 
significant reduction in burden of pneumococcal disease resulting from implementation and widespread 
use of currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). 
IPD 
IPD follows a seasonal pattern, with the number of cases peaking in the winter months. In the 
European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA), in 2018, a total of 24,663 confirmed cases of 
IPD were reported. IPD incidence from 2012 through 2017 ranged from 4.6 to 5.8 and 11.4 to 13.7 in 
children 1-4 years and <1 year old, respectively. Annual incidence was 14.4 per 100 000 infants <1 
year in 2018. In Europe in 2018, the case fatality rate of IPD was 15%. In children younger than 15 
years, the case fatality rate of IPD is 4%. In the paediatric population, this morbidity and mortality 
disproportionately impacts children <5 years of age. 
The overall incidence of IPD due to serotypes covered by vaccines currently licensed for routine use in 
children has decreased significantly in all age groups in regions where PCVs have been introduced into 
infant immunization schedules, with the exception of serotype 3. IPD cases caused by 2 serotypes not 
included in vaccines currently licensed for use in children, 22F and 33F, have increased in frequency in 
several regions and countries. Based on ECDC 2017 serotype distribution data, the serotypes 
contained in PCV13 still cause 25.3% and 22.4% of residual IPD in children <1 and children 1 to 4 
years of age in the EU, respectively. The two serotypes 22F and 33F cause 8.5% and 6.8% of IPD in 
children <1 and children 1 to 4 years of age in the EU. Therefore, V114 which contains all serotypes in 
PCV13 plus 22F and 33F, has the potential to prevent 33.8% and 29.2% of IPD in children <1 and 
children 1 to 4 years of age in the EU.

Page 7/150 
 
 
 
  
 
Pneumonia 
Pneumococcal pneumonia can be bacteremic or nonbacteremic. Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia 
is the most frequent presentation of IPD in adults, accounting for approximately 80-90% of IPD cases. 
Globally, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children, killing approximately 800,000 under the 
age of 5 years in 2017, accounting for 15% of all deaths in that age group. S. pneumoniae is the most 
common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children. The WHO estimates that S. pneumoniae kills close 
to half a million children under 5 years of age worldwide every year. Most of these deaths occur in 
developing countries. 
Acute otitis media 
Acute otitis media (AOM), a middle ear infection commonly caused by S. pneumoniae, is a major cause 
of childhood morbidity. AOM is one of the most common childhood infections in children less than 5 
years of age and the most frequent reason children are prescribed antibiotics. Approximately 68% of 
children will have had at least 1 episode of AOM by 6 years of age. Since the introduction of PCVs, 
there has been a decrease in AOM. Nevertheless, AOM remains common in paediatric populations.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
S. pneumoniae is a gram-positive encapsulated diplococcus, which commonly asymptomatically 
colonizes the human nasopharynx. Carriage rates decline with age (approx. 1/3rd to 2/3rds of children 
and ≤10% of adults are colonized). Transmission occurs mainly via nasal shedding (mucus droplets). 
Usually, pneumococci are cleared, however sometimes they can cause mucosal disease by local spread 
to the middle ear, sinuses or lungs. Additionally, they can be the causative agents of systemic 
infections, causing IPD. The progression to disease depends on complex host-pathogen interactions, 
involving a multitude of bacterial virulence factors and inflammatory host cascades. 
The capsular polysaccharide on the cell surface of the pneumococci is the most important virulence 
factor. The polysaccharide capsule exists in approx. 100 different chemical compositions called 
serotypes. The polysaccharide capsule interferes with phagocytosis by preventing complement C3b 
opsonisation of bacterial cells. The mechanism of action of all licensed pneumococcal vaccines is the 
induction of protective, serotype-specific, anti-capsular antibodies that enhance opsonisation, 
phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci. These functional antibodies against the capsular 
polysaccharides have been shown to be protective. Conferred protection is serotype-specific, no 
serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccines are available. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
IPD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both children and adults worldwide. 
Serious manifestations of IPD include meningitis, septicaemia and bacteraemic pneumonia. 
The most frequent complication of AOM is hearing impairment, which may occur despite antibiotic 
therapy, leading to profound language and cognitive sequelae in the intellectually developing child. Left 
untreated, AOM can lead to perforated eardrum, hearing loss and mastoiditis. 
Management 
Treatment of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is based on clinical presentation and antimicrobial 
susceptibility data. Most cases with clinical symptoms consistent with IPD require initiation of empiric 
treatment before bacterial culture results are known. Initial treatment generally includes broad-
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 8/150 
 
 
 
  
 
spectrum antibiotics that have efficacy against S. pneumoniae as well as other likely pathogens. The 
increase in pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and other commonly used antimicrobial agents 
complicates treatment decisions and may lead to treatment failures with subsequent increased 
morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Prevention of PD in children includes universal routine childhood vaccination with PCVs as well as 
prophylactic use of antibiotics and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in special populations 
(e.g., children with functional or anatomic asplenia). Pneumococcal vaccines have shown efficacy and 
effectiveness against invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes 
contained in those vaccines in both children and adults. Currently two vaccines are licensed for this 
indication in children in the EU: Prevenar13 (PCV13) and Synflorix (only for children up to 5 years of 
age). Another pneumococcal vaccine is licensed but not for the intended infant population 
(PNEUMOVAX23). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
V114 is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) that contains 15 distinct pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharides, each individually conjugated to the CRM197 carrier protein originating from 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae C7: serotype 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 
33F. 
V114 contains the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) included in 
the licensed vaccine Prevenar 13™ (PCV13), plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) that are not 
included in any currently licensed PCV. 
Conjugation of polysaccharides changes the nature of the immune response to polysaccharide antigens 
from T-cell independent to T-cell dependent, as it stimulates a T-helper response. Due to the 
conjugation, V114 elicits a T-cell dependent immune response that induces antibodies which enhance 
opsonisation, phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci to protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Carrier protein-specific helper T-cells support specificity, functionality, and maturation of serotype-
specific B cells. V114 may not prevent disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes that 
are not contained in the vaccine. 
The proposed indication is: 
Vaxneuvance is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia 
and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 
6 weeks to less than 18 years of age. 
The recommended posology in infants and children <2 years for V114 consists of 2- or 3-doses, each 
of 0.5 mL, with the first dose given as early as 6 to 12 weeks of age, followed by a toddler dose of 0.5 
mL given between 11 to 15 months of age. For children 7 months to less than 18 years of age who are 
pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or not fully vaccinated or completed a dosing regimen with lower valency 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, a catch-up schedule should be considered. The catch-up schedule 
consists of 3-doses in infants 7 to <12 months of age, 2 doses in children aged 12 months to <2 years 
and 1 dose in children and adolescents of 2 to <18 years of age.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Development programme 
The clinical development program for V114 to support licensure in children 6 weeks through 17 years 
of age includes immunogenicity and safety data from 8 clinical studies: 1 Phase 2 (V114-008) and 7 
Phase 3 (V114-023, V114-024, V114-025, V114-027, V114-029, V114-030, V114-031). 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
The most relevant CHMP guidelines applied: 
“Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines” (CPMP/VWP/164653/05, Rev.1) 
Scientific Advice 
During the course of development, the sponsor sought regulatory and scientific advice from EMA’s 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). These are detailed below: 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III. CHMP stated that the Pn ECL assay must be adequately 
bridged to the WHO reference ELISA protocol in order to maintain the serological link to the protective 
efficacy that has been demonstrated for the 7-valent PnC vaccine. The choice of Prevenar 13 as the 
licensed comparator vaccine is agreed as it has the highest number of serotypes in common with 
V114. The proposed Phase III studies and immunological endpoints (in particular the WHO ELISA 
threshold of 0.35 µg/mL and the OPA≥1:8) will support the IPD indication, however, the Company 
should conduct post-marketing studies to evaluate vaccine effectiveness against AOM and pneumonia. 
The post-marketing program should also include population-based surveillance of the incidence rates 
of IPD in several different countries for an appreciable number of years using national surveillance 
systems in particular for the new serotypes for which efficacy against IPD is not known. The proposed 
noninferiority criteria would require careful justification. It was recommended to use Prevenar 7 to 
bridge to the data on efficacy for the seven serotypes in the Prevenar 7 vaccine 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III. CHMP was consulted and agreed on the scope of the 
proposed paediatric development plan before the Applicant submitted the paediatric investigational 
plan (PIP). It was concluded that the use of V114 from the age of 6 weeks can be supported as well as 
the rationale for a waiver below 6 weeks. The study planned with the 3, 5, 12-15 months of age dosing 
schedule was not necessary. The data obtained from the study with the more stringent 2, 4, 12-15 
months dosing schedule should suffice to support a posology that covers the more relaxed 3, 5, 12-15 
months schedule. The suggestion to administer V114 concomitantly with vaccines administered in the 
frame of routine child vaccination programs as offered in several European countries is supported. The 
criteria proposed to conclude non-inferiority for immune responses to the 13 shared serotypes and 
superiority for the two non-shared serotypes are agreed. In addition, it is recommended that a 
secondary analysis compares the percentages of children who achieve immune responses to the two 
additional serotypes at or above the threshold value of the lowest percentage of children who achieve 
immune responses documented for any shared serotype. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

An overview of the clinical studies included in the present submission is provided in Table 1. As 
discussed in the scientific advice, there are no efficacy studies with V114, as efficacy will be inferred 
based on immunogenicity.  
This application for licensure is based on the inference of V114 efficacy for the prevention of vaccine 
serotype-specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration of noninferior immune responses to the 
13 shared serotypes in PCV13. A surrogate of protection for IPD has been defined in children of an IgG 
titer of 0.35 µg/mL. All studies were controlled randomised double-blind trials. The applicant has 
declared that studies were conducted in accordance with GCP principles; there is no sign from studies 
that this would not be the case. 
A total of 7 phase 3 studies (V114-023, V114-024, V114-025, V114-027, V114-029, V114-030, and 
V114-031) and 1 phase 2 study (V114-008) were conducted with V114. PCV13 was included as a 
comparator in all studies. In total 8,381 infants and children were enrolled in the studies across 
26 countries, which randomized in different ratios to various regimens. Of these 8,381 participants, in 
total of 5,336 infants and children (including 221 preterm infants [<37 weeks gestational age at birth]) 
received at least 1 dose of V114. The clinical program targeted both healthy and immunocompromised 
infants and children 6 weeks through 17 years of age for whom pneumococcal vaccination is indicated: 
•  4 studies in healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age (including preterm infants): V114-008, 
V114-025, V114-029 and V114-031) 
•  1 study in healthy children 7 months through 17 years of age (V114-024) 
•  1 study in children 5 through 17 years of age with SCD (V114-023) 
•  1 study in children 6 through 17 years with HIV (V114-030) 
Studies in healthy infants evaluated a 3-dose PCV regimen (2-dose primary series followed by a 
toddler dose) (V114-025) and 4-dose PCV regimen (3-dose primary series followed by a toddler dose) 
(V114-008, V114-027, V114-029, V114-031). Additional studies evaluated the interchangeability of 
PCV13 (the current standard of care) and V114 at any time during a 4-dose PCV regimen (V114-027), 
catch-up vaccination in children who were pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or not fully vaccinated or 
completed a dosing regimen with lower valency PCVs (V114-024), and use of V114 in paediatric 
populations at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, including preterm infants (V114-025, V114-
027, V114-029, V114-031), children with SCD (V114-023), and children with HIV (V114-030).

The clinical evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of V114 aligns with WHO recommendations and 
feedback from regulatory agencies, as follows: 
- 
The active comparator in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 paediatric studies was PCV13, the licensed 
PCV with the most serotypes in common with V114. 
-  Safety was evaluated across all paediatric age groups (from infants 6 weeks of age to children 
through 17 years of age). 
- 
Immunogenicity was evaluated through (1) demonstration of serotype-specific immune 
responses that are noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and for 2 serotypes 
unique to V114 (22F, 33F) after the primary series and/or after the toddler dose, (2) 
generation of antibodies to opsonize and kill S. pneumoniae, and (3) induction of immune 
memory after the primary series. 
CHMP’s comment 
The  clinical  development  programme  has  been  agreed  by  the  CHMP  and  PDCO.  No  efficacy  trials  are 
planned as these are not considered feasible. It is acknowledged that a majority of participants included 
in the studies are healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, which is the main population in which V114 will 
be used. 
The  serological  threshold  0.35  µg/mL  has  been  defined  to  be  used  for  non-inferiority  comparison  to 
support  protection  against  invasive  pneumococcal  disease  in  children  only.  No  correlate  of  protection 
exists for AOM and pneumonia. In addition, no correlate of protection for IPD has been established for 
the new serotypes included in the current vaccine. The MAH stated that the final clinical study results 
from an ongoing AOM vaccine-efficacy trial (V114-032) are anticipated for submission to the Agency by 
end of 2Q2027. In addition, PSURs will contain 1) information on spontaneous reports of breakthrough 
disease/vaccine failure for IPD, AOM and pneumonia, 2) V114 efficacy/effectiveness/impact studies and 
publications in children for all 3 indications, and 3) new data on serotype distribution and incidence from 
IPD surveillance from countries where V114 is broadly used. Together these data will provide information 
on vaccine effectiveness.  
A  matched case-control study  indicated that PCV13  was effective in  the prevention of  IPD in  children 
(Moore et al. Lancet Respir Med 2016). In addition, since IPD cases caused by serotypes included in the 
PCV13 have decreased over time, give further indication on efficacy (PCV13 SmPC). The fact that PCV13 
is considered efficacious reduces the need to bridge back to the data on efficacy for the seven serotypes 
in the Prevenar 7 vaccine as suggested in the scientific advice in 2010. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No biopharmaceutic studies were conducted in support of this application. This is acceptable, as 
pharmacokinetic studies are not routinely conducted as part of the evaluation of vaccines, as described 
in the CHMP “Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic profile of V114 is defined by the immunogenicity profile. The overall strategy of 
the development of V114 was agreed by the CHMP via scientific advice. Immunogenicity results are 
described in the Clinical Efficacy sections.

Mechanism of action 
V114 elicits a T-cell dependent immune response to induce antibodies that enhance opsonisation, 
phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci to protect against pneumococcal disease. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In the V114 paediatric clinical program, vaccine-induced, serotype-specific immune responses in the 
form of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic antibody activity (OPA) for all 15 serotypes 
included in V114 were measured using validated pneumococcal electrochemiluminescence (Pn ECL) 
assays and multiplex opsonophagocytic assay (MOPA), respectively. During MAA these assays were 
considered fit for purpose. However, the bridge to WHO ELISA was not considered for adults, as no 
surrogate of protection exists for adults, and therefore not described during the MAA procedure.  
A surrogate of protection against IPD for children of 0.35 µg/mL has been derived from a meta-
analysis of 3 efficacy trials. 
The benefits of the ECL multiplex technology over the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
methodology include speed, smaller sample volumes (particularly desirable for infants), increased 
dynamic range, and the ability to multiplex. The WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization 
has recommended that in-house assays used in immunogenicity studies designed to evaluate 
protection against IPD be bridged to the WHO reference assay in order to maintain the link between 
immune responses to vaccination and the clinical demonstration of protective efficacy against IPD 
conferred by the 7 conjugated polysaccharides in Prevnar.  
A study was performed to bridge the validated Pn ECL assay to the WHO reference assay. This bridging 
study included 116 paediatric serum samples immunized with three doses of V114 (adjuvanted or non-
adjuvanted), collected from the United States as part of the Merck Phase 1/2 clinical studies. The 
paediatric samples were selected with antibody concentrations that spanned the entire range of 
response, with a concerted effort to secure samples with serotype-specific IgG concentrations near the 
WHO ELISA threshold value of 0.35 μg/mL in order to better assess the concordance between the two 
assays in the region of the threshold value. The study also included 12 adult serum samples vaccinated 
with a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine provided by Professor David Goldblatt. 
Each of the 128 serum samples (116 paediatric samples and 12 Goldblatt samples) was tested across 
three independent runs in the Pn ECL assay and across three independent runs in the WHO ELISA. 
Within each of the ECL runs, samples were tested in duplicate at the 1:1000 dilution (or further 
dilution if necessary). Within each of the WHO ELISA runs, samples were tested in a series of 8, 2.5- 
fold dilutions starting at the 1:50 dilution. The sample quantifiable median concentrations (log 
transformed) were used to estimate the concordance slope, the average fold difference, and the 
accuracy, correlation, and concordance coefficients. 
Generally, Pn ECL v2.0 and WHO ELISA assays resulted in fairly similar concentrations throughout the 
range of response. However, serotype 5 antibody concentration was 52% higher on average in the Pn 
ECL as compared to the WHO ELISA. For the other 14 serotypes, the average difference in antibody 
concentration between the Pn ECL and the WHO ELISA was between -22% and 29%.  
As indicated in Table 2, the concordance slope estimates ranged from 0.97 to 1.33 for the set of 
paediatric samples. Across the 15 evaluated serotypes, the concentration in the Pn ECL ranged from 
0.63-fold to 1.49-fold that of the ELISA at 0.35 μg/mL for the paediatric sample set.

Table 2 
Concordance slope, average % difference and fold difference at 0.35 µg/mL - 
paediatric samples 
Both the concordance method and the reverse cumulative distribution function method were used to 
determine serotype specific Pn ECL threshold values.   
For the paediatric sample set, using the 0.35 μg/mL cut off for the Pn ECL v2.0 and WHO ELISA 
assays, the agreement rates in serostatus assignment were greater than 80% for all serotypes, see 
Table 3. Using either the concordance threshold value or the RCDF threshold value for individual 
serotypes resulted in only a slight improvement in serostatus agreement rates as compared to the 
0.35 μg/mL cutoff.

Note: 1) Agreement rate for each serotype is determined using 0.35 μg/mL as the threshold for 
the WHO ELISA assay and 3 different threshold values for the Pn ECL assay. 2) The bolded 
agreement rate value indicates that the corresponding test of imbalance in the discordance 
between the two assays is statistically significant (P-Value < 0.05). 
Given: (1) the proximity of the aggregate Pn ECL threshold values to the WHO ELISA threshold of 
0.35 μg/mL (0.35 μg/mL using the concordance method, and 0.38 μg/mL using the RCDF method); (2) 
that the serotype specific Pn ECL threshold values were within 1.60-fold of 0.35 μg/mL for each of the 
15 serotypes; and (3) that the agreement rates between assays were only slightly improved when 
using the serotype specific threshold values for the Pn ECL as compared to using the 0.35 μg/mL 
threshold, the single Pn ECL threshold value of 0.35 μg/mL can reasonably be applied to each of the 15 
evaluated serotypes.  
For each serotype, the variability of the Pn ECL v2.0 assay was either comparable to that of the WHO 
ELISA, or notably less than that of the WHO ELISA (serotypes 4, 5, 6A and 14). 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The set-up of the bridging study was adequate and was in line with guidance by WHO and the scientific 
advices received in March 2010 (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III) and May 2017 
(EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III). In the scientific advice of 2017, the general approach for using 
immunobridging was agreed.  
Overall, the IgG concentrations obtained using the Pn ECL v2.0 and WHO ELISA assays were similar 
throughout the range of response, as for 14 of the 15 serotypes the average difference in antibody 
concentration ranged between -22% and 29%. Serotype 5 resulted in approximately 50% higher 
concentrations in the Pn ECL assay compared to the WHO ELISA, the reason for this is unclear. This 
could result in overestimation of the immune response for serotype 5 when using Pn ECL assay. Based 
on the presented data, it can be agreed that the single Pn ECL threshold value of 0.35 μg/mL can be 
applied to each of the 15 evaluated serotypes, especially considering the fact that the agreement rates 
between assays were only slightly, <8%, improved when using the serotype specific threshold values 
for the Pn ECL as compared to using the 0.35 μg/mL threshold. In addition, the threshold of 0.35 
μg/mL is a conservative threshold, considering that there is consensus that the protective level of 
antibody as measured by ELISA lies between 0.18 and 0.35 μg/ml (Plotkin, 2010 Clinical and Vaccine 
Immunology). However, whether this threshold also applies for the new serotypes included in this 
vaccine, is currently unknown. Information on breakthrough disease/vaccine failure for IPD, AOM and 
pneumonia will be provided in PSURs, which will provide indications on efficacy. 
The PnECL assay was adequately bridged to the WHO ELISA, indicating comparability of the 
measurements between the PnECL assay and the WHO ELISA. Therefore, a link to the surrogate of 
protection of 0.35 µg/mL has been established.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The evaluation of the protective effect of V114 is based on bridging clinical immunogenicity results to 
PCV13. This strategy has been accepted by CHMP in scientific advice procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III.  
There are no dedicated PK studies. This can be accepted, as PK studies are generally not required for 
vaccines.  
The applicant has utilised two assays to characterise the vaccine-induced immune response: Pn ECL to 
measure IgGs and MOPA, which measures functional antibodies as the assay is designed to mimic the 
opsonophagocytosis process. The Pn ECL measures all antibodies against specific serotypes. Both 
assays were validated and shown to be fit for purpose. In addition, the PnECL assay was bridged to the 
WHO ELISA, confirming a link between the immune responses generated by V114 vaccination and the 
clinical demonstration of protective efficacy against IPD conferred by the 7 conjugated polysaccharides 
in Prevenar. The surrogate of protection of 0.35 µg/mL can be used to infer protection against IPD. 
However, for the new serotypes included in the vaccine it needs to be confirmed, using adequate post 
marketing studies, whether the 0.35 µg/mL threshold is indeed indicative for efficacy. Information on 
this will be provided in spontaneous reports of breakthrough disease/vaccine failure. In addition, it 
needs to be taken into consideration that for pneumonia and AOM no correlate or surrogate of 
protection exists. These indications were granted to PCV13 based on non-inferiority of immune 
response to PCV7. Efficacy has been shown for PCV13 for these indications post-marketing, however, 
the strategy of non-inferiority testing for V114 to PCV13 introduces the possibility of biocreep for the 
shared serotypes as there is no known correlate of protection. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy

submission consists of a total of 7 phase 3 studies (V114-023, V114-024, V114-025, V114-027, 
V114-029, V114-030, and V114-031) and 1 phase 2 study (V114-008). Studies V114-025 (3-dose 
regimen) and V114-029 (4-dose regimen) are considered pivotal as they provide the main evidence for 
immunogenicity and safety in the target population. 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
The MAH submitted eight studies (1 Phase 2 and 7 Phase 3 studies) to support the extension of 
indication of V114. Two studies were considered pivotal by the MAH: Study V114-025 and V114-029. 
The methods of these 2 studies are described below, where possible the presentation of methods has 
been integrated. 
Methods 
V114-025 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 in healthy infants enrolled at 
approximately 2 months of age (from 42 to 90 days). V114 or Prevenar 13™ was administered to full-
term participants at approximately 2, 4, and 11 to 15 months of age and to preterm infants at 
approximately 2, 3, 4, and 11 to 15 months of age.

V114-029 
This  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  active  comparator-controlled  study  to 
evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability  and  immunogenicity  of  a  4-dose  regimen  of  V114  in  healthy  infants 
enrolled at approximately 2 months of age (from 42 to 90 days). V114 or PCV13 was administered at 
approximately 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 
CHMP’s comment  
Both pivotal studies were active-comparator controlled, randomized, double-blind studies, which is 
appreciated. 
Study participants 
Both studies enrolled healthy male and female infants at approximately 2 months of age, from 42 to 
90 days (inclusive) who had a legally acceptable representative who understood the study procedures, 
alternate treatments available, and risks involved with the study and voluntarily agreed to participate. 
In addition to several standard exclusion criteria for vaccine trials, the main exclusion criteria for both 
studies were:  
-  History of IPD (positive blood culture, positive cerebrospinal fluid culture, or other sterile site) 
or known history of other culture positive pneumococcal disease. 
-  Had a known hypersensitivity to any component of the PCV, any component of the licensed 
paediatric vaccines to be administered concomitantly in the study, or any diphtheria toxoid-
containing vaccine. 
-  Had any contraindication to the concomitant study vaccines being administered in the study. 
-  Had a recent febrile illness (rectal temperature ≥38˚C [≥100.5˚F] or axillary temperature 
≥37.8˚C [≥100.0˚F]) occurring within 72 hours prior to receipt of study vaccine. 
-  Had received a dose of any pneumococcal vaccine prior to study entry. 
CHMP’s comment 
The study populations included healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, which is the main population in 
which V114 will be administered. This is acceptable.  
In- and exclusion criteria are adequately defined and seem appropriate. 
Treatments 
During Study V114-025, V114 or PCV13 was administered to full-term participants at approximately 
2, 4, and 11 to 15 months of age and to preterm infants at approximately 2, 3, 4, and 11 to 15 
months of age (time from birth, not corrected for due date), see Table 4. All participants were also 
administered concomitant paediatric vaccines (i.e., INFANRIX™ hexa and Rotarix™) during the study.

CHMP’s comment 
The dosing regimen of V114 used during the studies represent the 2 proposed dosing regimens 
included in the SmPC: a 2-dose primary series followed by a booster and a 3-dose primary series 
followed by a booster. The proposed dosing regimens are identical to the comparator PCV13.

The choice of PCV13 as comparator was agreed by CHMP, as it has the highest number of serotypes in 
common with V114 (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III). 
The administration of V114 concomitantly with vaccines administered in the frame of routine child 
vaccination programs as offered in several European countries is appreciated. This is in line with the 
scientific advice given.

infants) for participants administered V114 versus participants administered PCV13. 
o  Hypothesis 1: V114 is non-inferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 
and PCV13 based on response rates at 30 days post toddler dose (PTD), using a non-
inferiority margin of -10% (The statistical criterion for non-inferiority requires the lower

Prevenar 13™ should be greater than -0.1). 
o  Hypothesis 2: V114 is superior to PCV13 for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 based on 
the response rates at 30 days PTD, using a superiority margin of 10%. (The statistical 
criterion for superiority requires the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the

CHMP’s comment 
A surrogate of protection has been determined for IPD: 0.35 µg/mL. This is a population-derived IgG 
antibody threshold value that was based on the meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies investigating 
effectiveness of the 7-valent Prevenar. There is general consensus that the protective level of antibody 
lies between 0.18 and 0.35 μg/mL. The surrogate of protection of 0.35 µg/mL has been used to infer 
efficacy during the MAA procedure of PCV13. Efficacy trials are not considered feasible and therefore 
demonstration of non-inferiority to the licensed PCV13 for the 13 common serotypes was agreed. 
However, with respect to pneumonia or AOM no correlates of protection exist. PCV13 has been shown 
to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated children has been observed post-
marketing. However, no exact vaccine efficacy estimate was determined, nor the immune response 
required to achieve protection. Therefore, non-inferiority testing introduces the possibility of biocreep. 
In addition, for the two unique serotypes it is unknown what the clinical impact of a superior immune 
response will be.  
The non-inferiority margin of -0.1 for the difference (V114 minus PCV13) in response rate and 0.5 for 
the GMC ratio (V114/PCV13) for the 13 shared serotypes has been agreed in the scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III) and is identical to the margin used during MAA of PCV13, during 
which PCV7 was the active comparator. 
Based on the study objectives for both pivotal studies, the immune response generated by V114 can 
be adequately compared to the immune response generated by PCV13. The proportion of participants 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

achieving IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL will be compared between V114 group and the PCV13 
group both 30 days post primary vaccination series and post-toddler dose in study V114-025 and only 
post primary series in study V114-029. IgG GMCs will be compared between V114 group and the 
PCV13 group 30 days post primary vaccination series, prior to the toddler dose and 30 days post 
toddler dose. In addition, OPA GMTs and response rate can be compared between V114 group and the 
PCV13 group 30 days post primary vaccination series, prior to the toddler dose and 30 days post 
toddler dose. Finally, response to concomitantly administered childhood vaccines can be compared 
between the 2 groups. The assessment will focus on the totality of evidence, which should be 
sufficiently convincing to ensure CHMP that V114 is likely to be efficacious in children. 
For study V114-025, the primary immunogenicity objective focusses on the vaccine response rate and 
IgG GMCs 30 days post toddler dose. It is debatable whether this should be the primary objective, 
considering the WHO guideline states that the primary analysis should be based on vaccine response 
rates and IgG GMCs post primary vaccine series, also taking into consideration the fact that IPD occurs 
frequently with severe disease course in infants <1 year of age. However, as the MAH has investigated 
both the immune response post toddler dose and post primary vaccination series both immune 
responses will be taken into consideration.  
For study V114-029, the primary immunogenicity objective focusses on vaccine response rate and 
IgG GMCs 30 days post primary vaccination and IgG GMCs 30 days post toddler dose, which is 
appreciated. However, vaccine response rate at 30 days post-toddler dose, which is also considered 
valuable information, was not included in the objectives.  
Study V114-025 investigates superiority of the 2 unique serotypes, while study V114-029 determines 
non-inferiority of the 2 unique serotypes by comparing to the lowest IgG GMC of any of the shared 
serotypes (except serotype 3). The latter is based on WHO guideline that indicates comparison of the 
unique serotypes to the lowest response of the shared serotypes and is preferred. The comparison to 
the lowest response indicates that at least a substantial response is generated known to be efficacious 
in other serotypes, however, it is unknown what the clinical relevance of this non-inferiority margin is. 
The assessment of OPA antibody IgG GMTs are considered supportive to the IgG GMCs and response 
rate. There is no correlate of protection known for OPA antibodies in children, therefore the clinical 
impact of the response induced is unknown.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The endpoints measured for both studies include: 
-  Anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG responses for the 15 serotypes contained in V114 at 30 days 
PPS, immediately pre-toddler dose and 30 days PTD.

PPS, immediately pre-toddler dose and 30 days PTD.  
CHMP’s comment 
In general, the chosen endpoints are considered acceptable and adequate to address the study 
objectives. The use of serotype specific IgG for primary immunogenicity analyses is endorsed, as an 
IgG titre of 0.35 µg/mL is a surrogate of protection. Assessment will be based on totality of 
immunogenicity findings based on all relevant parameters, therefore in-depth assessment of the 
immune response is appreciated. Totality of all immunogenicity results will be assessed. 
Sample size 
V114-025 
The targeted sample size was 1180 participants, 590 in each vaccination group. The sample size was 
chosen to ensure sufficient power to evaluate both primary and secondary hypotheses. The study will 
be considered to have met its primary immunogenicity objective if non-inferiority is demonstrated with 
respect to IgG GMCs and response rates for the 13 shared serotypes and superiority is demonstrated 
with respect to IgG GMCs and response rates for the 2 unique serotypes at 30 days PTD (post dose 3).  
With this study sample size and the assumptions described below, the overall power for the primary 
hypotheses is >95% at a 1-sided 2.5% alpha level for demonstrating non-inferiority of V114 to PCV13 
for the 13 shared serotypes and superiority for the 2 unique serotypes for V114 formulations. The 
overall power for the secondary hypotheses for concomitant antigens evaluation is approximately 90%. 
The following assumptions were applied:  
- 
For all hypothesis: an approximately 75% evaluability rate at post toddler dose as observed in 
previous Phase 2 V114 paediatric studies;  
-  V114 is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and superior to PCV13 for the 2 
unique serotypes based on IgG response rate, defined as the proportion of participants with a 
titer at or above the threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 days PTD (Hypothesis 1 and 2):  
o  Non-inferiority margin of -0.1 for the difference (V114-PCV13) for the 13 shared 
serotypes. 
o  Superiority margin of 0.1 for the difference (V114-PCV13) for the 2 unique serotypes. 
o  Underlying serotype-specific IgG response rates are 95% at 30 days PTD in the V114 
group and 95% for the 13 serotypes in PCV13 and 2% for the 2 unique serotypes in 
the PCV13 group. 
-  V114 is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and superior to PCV13 for the 2 
unique serotypes based on IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD (Hypothesis 3 and 4):  
o  Non-inferiority margin of 0.5 (V114/PCV13) for the 13 shared serotypes. 
o  Superiority margin of 2.0 (V114/PCV13) for the 2 unique serotypes.

o  Standard Deviation (SD) of IgG GMCs in log scale is 1.1 as those observed in previous 
MSD studies. 
o  The true GMT ratio (V114/PCV13) for IgG GMCs is 1.0 for the 13 shared serotypes and 
10.0 for the 2 unique serotypes. 
For the hypotheses driven secondary endpoints, the power is 90.9% and >95% for each of the 2 non-
inferiority hypotheses when INFANRIX™ hexa and Rotarix™ administered concomitantly with V114 or 
PCV13, respectively. This is based on the assumptions of approximately 80% evaluability rate at PPS 
for Rotarix™ and 75% evaluability rate at PTD for INFANRIX™ hexa. The assumed response rates, 
GMT, and non-inferiority margins are listed in Table 6.

is sufficient volume. 
V114-029 
The overall sample size will be approximately 1720 with 860 participants into each vaccination group. 
The sample size was chosen to ensure sufficient power for the multiple endpoints across both primary 
and secondary hypotheses. The study will be considered to have met its primary objectives if non-
inferiority is demonstrated for the 13 shared serotypes and for the 2 unique serotypes for IgG GMCs 
and IgG response rates at 30 days PPS (post dose 3) and for IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD (post dose 4). 
With this study sample size and the assumptions listed below, the overall power for all the primary 
hypotheses is >95% to demonstrate non-inferiority of V114 to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and 
the 2 unique serotypes for V114. The overall power for the secondary hypotheses for concomitant 
antigens evaluation is approximately 90%, to demonstrate superiority for the 2 unique V114 serotypes 
is >95%, and to demonstrate the superiority for the serotype 3 IgG response rates and IgG GMCs at 
30 days PD3 is >95%, and IgG GMCs at 30 days PD4 is 94%.

The following assumptions were applied:  
- 
For all hypothesis: an approximately 80% evaluability rate at PPS and approximately 75% 
evaluability rate at PTD.  
o  V114 is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and the 2 unique serotypes 
based on IgG response rate at 30 days PPS (Hypothesis 1 & 2). A non-inferiority 
margin of -0.1 for the difference (V114 minus PCV13) in the 13 shared serotypes. A 
serotype-specific true response rate for 15 pneumococcal serotypes in V114 of 0.95 for 
all serotypes except 3, 6B, 23F and 33F for which the response rate is 0.90. 
o  V114 is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and the 2 unique serotypes 
based on IgG GMCs at 30 days PPS (Hypothesis 3 & 4). A non-inferiority margin of 0.5 
for the GMC ratio (V114/PCV13) in the 13 shared serotypes. A true GMC ratio of 1.0 for 
the 13 shared serotypes and for the 2 unique serotypes between V114 and the lowest 
GMC of any of the shared serotypes in PCV13, excluding serotype 3. The standard 
deviation of the natural log concentrations is 1.1 for each of the 15 pneumococcal 
serotypes in V114. 
o  V114 is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and the 2 unique serotypes 
based on IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD (Hypothesis 5 & 6). The standard deviation of the 
natural log concentrations is 1.1 for each of the 15 pneumococcal serotypes in V114.  
A true GMC ratio of 1.0 for the 13 shared serotypes and and for the 2 unique serotypes 
between V114 and the lowest GMC of any of the shared serotypes in PCV13, excluding 
serotype 3.  
-  Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints/Hypotheses (Hypothesis 7 to 11): 
o  This study has >90% power at a 1-sided 2.5% alpha-level to demonstrate Pentacel™, 
VAQTA™, M-M-R™II, VARIVAX™, and HIBERIX™ administered concomitantly with 
V114 is non-inferior to these vaccines administered concomitantly with PCV13 based 
on the response rate of antigens included in Pentacel™ at 30 days PD3 and antigens 
included in VAQTA™, M-M-R™II, VARIVAX™, and HIBERIX™ at 30 days PD4. This 
power assumes the same underlying response rate in both V114 group and PCV13 
group for each antigen. Detailed assumptions for concomitant antigens are provided in 
Table 7.

o  V114 is superior to PCV13 for the 2 unique serotypes based on the proportion of 
participants with serotype-specific IgG responses achieving the threshold value of 
0.35 μg/mL at 30 days PPS (post dose 3) (Hypothesis 12). A superiority margin of 0.1 
for the difference (V114 minus PCV13). A serotype-specific true response rate for the 2 
V114 unique serotypes of 0.95 for 22F and 0.90 for 33F vs 0.02 for PCV13. 
o  V114 is superior to PCV13 for the 2 unique serotypes based on serotype-specific IgG 
GMCs at 30 days PD3 and 30 days PTD (post dose 4) (Hypothesis 13 &14). A 
superiority margin of 2.0 for the GMC ratio (V114/PCV13). A true GMC ratio of 10.0. 
The standard deviation of the natural log concentrations is 1.1. 
o  V114 is superior to PCV13 for serotype 3 based on the proportion of participants with 
serotype-specific IgG responses achieving the threshold value of 0.35 μg/mL at 30 
days PPS (post dose 3) (Hypothesis 15). A superiority margin of 0 for the difference 
(V114 minus PCV13). A true response rate for serotype 3 of 0.95 in the V114 group vs 
0.76 in the PCV13 group. 
o  V114 is superior to PCV13 for serotype 3 based on serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 
days PPS (post dose 3) (>95% power) and 30 days PTD (post dose4) (94% power) 
(Hypothesis 16 & 17). A superiority margin of 1.2 for the GMC ratio (V114/PCV13). 
True GMC ratios of 1.94 at 30 days PPS and 1.38 at 30 days PTD. The standard 
deviation of the natural log concentrations is of 0.75 at 30 days PPS and 0.73 at 30 
days PTD. 
Due to the larger serum requirements of the MOPA, functional antibody activity (as measured by OPA 
GMTs) will be assessed in the first 20% of all participants with sufficient serum volume at PD3 to 
evaluate OPA responses (OPA Subset). Additionally, evaluation of OPA responses will be conducted at 
Predose 4 and PD4 for 50% of the participants who had OPA performed at PD3, for whom there is 
sufficient volume. 
CHMP’s comment 
The main driver for the sample size calculation of the pivotal studies was to achieve sufficient power to 
meet immunogenicity objectives. The underlying assumptions appear plausible.  
The sample size accounts for 25% non-evaluability at post-toddler dose, even though this is the PP 
population, this exclusion rate is considered high. As non-evaluability might be linked to 
immunogenicity, handling of non-evaluable subjects in the analysis deserved further attention (see 
statistical methods). 
Multiplicity is controlled for the primary endpoints.  
As stated above, the non-inferiority margins have been agreed in the scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III) and are identical to the margin used during MAA of PCV13, during 
which PCV7 was the active comparator.  
The interpretation of the immune response generated by V114 for the 2 unique serotypes is hampered 
by the fact that the clinical relevance of this response is unknown. However, non-inferiority criteria on 
IgG response rate posed for the 2 unique serotypes based on the lowest response generated by the 
shared serotypes (excluding serotype 3) at least indicates that a substantial and potentially clinically 
relevant response was generated. 
Measuring of OPA GMTs in approximately 20% of subjects will provide sufficient insight into the 
immune response generated by V114 and PCV13.

Randomisation 
For both pivotal studies, treatment allocation occurred centrally using interactive response technology 
(IRT) system. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to V114 or PCV13. 
For Study V114-025, randomization was stratified based on gestational age <37 weeks (yes/no); No 
preterm infants will be enrolled at sites in the Russian Federation.  
In Study V114-029 no stratification factors were used. 
CHMP’s comment 
Randomization using a central IRT system is acceptable.  
For study V114-025 randomisation was stratified for gestational age which is endorsed, as dosing 
regimen was different between term- and preterm infants. 
No stratification by gestational age was performed during study V114-029. Stratification by gestational 
age would have been appreciated. However, considering the study showed a comparable distribution in 
both study arms, no additional information is requested. 
No stratification for centre has been performed, due to small number of participants that would be 
included in analyses from each centre. Upon request the MAH performed additional sensitivity analyses 
adjusting the primary analyses for region. No substantial differences were observed, indicating a minor 
impact of region on immunogenicity. 
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were double blind and used a similar method of blinding: 
V114 and PCV13 will be prepared and/or dispensed by an unblinded pharmacist or unblinded qualified 
study site personnel. The participant and the investigator who are involved in the clinical evaluation of 
the participants will remain blinded to the group assignments. 
Because V114 and PCV13 have a different appearance, a member of the study site staff will be 
unblinded for the purposes of receiving, maintaining, preparing, and administering these study 
vaccines. The paediatric vaccines being provided in the study will also be prepared and administered 
by unblinded study site staff for consistency even though these vaccines are being provided open label 
for this study.  
To avoid bias, the unblinded study personnel will have no further contact with study participants for 
any study-related procedures/assessments after administration of study vaccines, which includes all 
safety follow-up procedures. Additionally, blinded site personnel will not be present in the examination 
room when study vaccines are administered. Contact between participants and unblinded study 
personnel after vaccination administration is strictly prohibited. Blinded site personnel will be 
responsible for all safety and immunogenicity follow-up procedures after vaccine administration. 
CHMP’s comment 
Both pivotal trials were double-blind.  
Blinding measures were taken to keep participants (legal guardians/parents), clinical staff and study-
site personnel blinded to the study vaccine allocation. In principle, the measures to ensure blinding are 
adequate. However, the administrator of the study vaccines was not blinded, and could theoretically

inform participants about the vaccine administered. As both vaccines are active, the likelihood and 
potential impact are considered limited. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population: 
Both studies defined similar analysis populations: 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population will serve as the primary population for the analysis of 
immunogenicity data in this study. The PP population consists of all randomized participants without 
deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the immunogenicity 
endpoint(s). 
A supportive analysis using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population will also be performed for the 
primary immunogenicity endpoints and selected secondary endpoints for the evaluation of concomitant 
vaccines. The FAS population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one PCV 
vaccination and have a serology result relevant to the immunogenicity endpoint and time point being 
analyzed. Participants will be included in the vaccination group to which they are randomized for the 
analysis of immunogenicity data using the FAS population. 
Safety analyses were based on all participants as treated population (APaT) population, which included 
all participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were included in the 
intervention group according to the intervention they actually received.

V114-025 
The study will be considered to have met its primary immunogenicity objective if non-inferiority is 
demonstrated with respect to IgG GMCs and response rates for the 13 shared serotypes and 
superiority is demonstrated with respect to IgG GMCs and response rates for the 2 unique serotypes at 
30 days PTD. All hypotheses will be tested individually for each serotype at a 1-sided 0.025 alpha 
level. This approach controls the 1-sided type-I error rate at 0.025; thus, no multiplicity adjustment is 
required.

CHMP’s comment 
The use of the PP to conclude on non-inferiority, with corresponding supportive analyses based on the 
FAS is supported, to allow conclusions on non-inferiority.  
Missing data are not imputed. The sample size accounts for 25% non-evaluability at post-toddler dose, 
which is considered relatively high. Non-evaluability might be linked to immunogenicity, therefore 
exclusion of non-evaluable subjects in the immunogenicity analysis should be further substantiated, 
and sensitivity analyses where missing are imputed using plausible assumptions were requested during 
the pre-submission meeting. Upon request during the pre-submission meeting, additional analyses 
were provided (supplementary document 07W0MX) in the all randomized population for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints. These additional analyses are appreciated. However, still randomized 
participants who did not have serology results at the time point for the analysis were not included in 
the analysis. The MAH argued that the reasons for missing serology results were generally balanced 
between vaccination groups. In addition, the MAH argued that the assay results were not available to 
the investigators at the time of clinical visits, so the missing data are unlikely to be dependent on the 
immunogenicity outcomes, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that the missing data are missing 
completely at random. Therefore, the MAH decided that no data were imputed for these analyses. We 
do not agree with the argument that the fact that assay results were not available to the investigator 
provides sufficient argument to assume missing completely at random, it does however make it likely 
that there was no purposive selection. However, the percentage of missing serology results from the 
FAS was relatively small and comparable over the groups as shown below.  
As there are also no strong effect modifiers known that impact immunogenicity results, and results 
were consistent between the PP and the FAS (see results), relying on the missing completely at 
random assumption unlikely has strong impact on the results. Therefore, this issue is not further 
pursued.  
Considering the fact that all primary objectives should be met prior to study being successful and all 
hypotheses will be tested individually for each serotype at a 1-sided 0.025 alpha level, for the primary 
hypothesis alpha is adequately controlled. However, for study V114-025 the study will be considered to 
have met its secondary objective for a specific concomitant vaccine if non-inferiority is demonstrated 
for all the antigens included in that concomitant vaccine, either INFARIX or ROTARIX. For study V114-
029 multiple hypothesis tests for secondary endpoints have been formulated, without a strategy to 
control type I error over these outcomes. Therefore, type I error is not adequately controlled in the 
strict sense over the secondary endpoints. Therefore, the results will be descriptive.

The between-treatment difference of the proportion of anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 
30 days PTD (V114 minus Prevenar 13™) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using 
unstratified Miettinen and Nurminen method. Coverage probabilities are generally close to the nominal

CHMP’s comment 
The participant flow is comparable in both treatment groups. The majority of enrolled participants were 
vaccinated (more than 99% of participants) and also completed the study (more than 95% of 
participants) in both groups. Low numbers of participants discontinued the study (22 participants 
[3.7%] vs 23 participants [3.9%] in the V114 vs the PCV13 group), with withdrawal by 
parent/guardian being the most reported reason; 17 subjects (2.9%) in both treatment groups.  
In both treatment groups, 1 Protocol deviation led to discontinuation of the study.  
The majority of participants, >84%, were included in the PP population in both treatment groups at 
each timepoint. Exclusion from immunogenicity analysis was divided into subject level exclusion and 
visit-level exclusion. Subject-level exclusion resulted in exclusion from all immunogenicity analyses at 
all timepoints and was identical in both treatment groups (n=9) with “missed at least one vaccination 
of PCV during the primary infant series” being the reported reason for exclusion.  
Visit-level exclusion at 30 days PPS was somewhat lower in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 
group, n=60 (10.2%) vs N=84 (14.2%) respectively. The most commonly reported reason for visit-
level exclusion in both treatment groups was blood draw out of window, with 25 subjects in the V114 
group (4.2%) and 23 subjects in the PCV13 group (3.9%), and vaccination out of window, with 19 
subjects in the V114 group (3.2%) and 31 subjects in the PCV13 group (5.2%). Generally, the reasons 
for exclusion were balanced over the groups, with more subjects out of window in the PCV13 group.  
Visit-level exclusions at both pre-toddler dose and PTD were comparable between the V114 and PCV13 
group, with 26 of participants (4.4%) and 43 of participants (7.3%) being excluded in the V114 group 
compared to 27 (4.6%) and 47 (7.9%) in the PCV13 group. The most commonly reported reasons for 
visit-level exclusion was missing serology results at pre-toddler dose and missed PCV at toddler dose 
(includes participants who discontinued the study) and missing serology results.

CHMP’s comment 
The participant flow is comparable in both treatment groups. The majority of enrolled participants were 
vaccinated (> 99% of participants) and also completed the study (> 85% of participants) in both 
groups.  More than 10% of participants discontinued the study (102 participants [11.9%] vs 126 
participants [14.7%] in the V114 vs the PCV13 group), with withdrawal by parent/guardian being the 
most reported reason in both treatment groups, with 59 participants (6.9%) in the V114 group vs 85 
participants (9.9%) in the PCV13 group.  
The majority of participants, >77%, were included in the PP population in both treatment groups at 
each timepoint.  
Exclusion from immunogenicity analysis was divided into subject level exclusion and visit-level 
exclusion. Subject-level exclusion resulted in exclusion from all immunogenicity analyses at all 
timepoints and was numerically lower in the V114 group (n=50, 5.8%) vs the PCV13 group (n=74, 
8.6%), with missed at least one vaccination of PCV during the primary infant series being the reported 
reason for exclusion.  
Visit-level exclusion at 30 days PPS was somewhat lower in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 
group, n=108 (12.6%) vs N=121 (14.1%) respectively. The most commonly reported reason for visit-
level exclusion in both treatment groups was blood draw out of window, with 31 subjects in the V114 
group (3.1%) and 41 subjects in the PCV13 group (4.8%), and missed serology results, with 62 
subjects in the V114 group (7.2%) and 65 subjects in the PCV13 group (7.6%). Generally, the reasons 
for exclusion were balanced over the groups. 
Visit-level exclusions at both pre-toddler dose and PTD were comparable between the V114 and PCV13 
group, with 67 of participants (7.8%) and 94 of participants (10.9%) being excluded in the V114 group 
compared to 63 (7.3%) and 100 (11.6%) in the PCV13 group. The most commonly reported reasons 
for visit-level exclusion was missing serology results at pre-toddler dose and missed PCV at toddler 
dose (includes participants who discontinued the study) and missing serology results.

CHMP’s comment 
The pivotal studies were performed more or less simultaneous, which is acceptable.  
It is appreciated that one of the pivotal studies was performed mainly in Europe. Of note, the studies 
were performed during the COVID pandemic. COVID impacted study conduct, which is discussed below.

Conduct of the study 
V114-025 
Amendments 
There were 2 amendments to the original study protocol (dd. 22 February 2019). Amendment 1 (24 
July 2019)  included country specific changes for the Russian Federation,  not Rotarix would be 
administred and  no pre-term infants would be enrolled. Amendment 2 (16 March 2021) aimed to 
expand the visit windows for Visit 4 (PPS blood draw) and Visit 6 (PTD blood draw) to allow inclusion of 
more participants in the immunogenicity analysis based on the per-protocol population. This change 
was made in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic which impacted the ability of many 
participants to attend study visits within the prescribed visit windows due to local conditions and travel 
restrictions. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 270 (22.8%) participants in the study. Of these, 186 
participants (15.7%) had protocol deviations that were considered clinically important, see Table 10. 
The most frequently reported clinically important protocol deviations were categorized under Trial 
Procedures, as the participant’s immunogenicity blood sample being drawn outside the protocol-
defined window. The protocol deviations were comparably distributed between intervention groups.

CHMP’s comment 
The study conduct was overall acceptable. The protocol amendments are not considered to impact 
subject well-being. The visit windows for Visit 4 (PPS blood draw) and Visit 6 (PTD blood draw) were 
expanded by 18 days. As this was done for both treatment arms, this is not expected to affect the 
difference between arms if the distribution of visits later in the window was comparable over the arms. 
It could potentially impact the measurement of the immune response, however, considering the 
relatively short expansion of the window by 18 days no clinically relevant impact is expected.

The MAH has comprehensively monitored the protocol deviations. Important protocol deviations were 
reported by 186 participants (15.7%) during the study, most of which were deviations in trial 
procedures, with blood drawn outside protocol-defined window being most commonly reported, for 
5.1% in the V114 group vs 6.9% in the PCV13 group, followed by study vaccination administered 
outside window, for 3.4% in the V114 group vs 5.9% in the PCV13 group. The percentage of clinically 
important protocol deviations were comparable between the V114 and PCV13 group (13.2% versus 
18.2%).  
V114-029  
Amendments 
There were 2 amendments to the original study protocol (dd. 30 January 2019). Amendment 1 
(28 February 2020) was included to more closely align with guidelines for the assessment of immune 
responses to PCVs from the World Health Organization, the 2 unique V114 serotypes will be evaluated 
for non-inferiority to the immune response of the lowest of any of the shared serotypes in PCV13, 
excluding serotype 3. For these comparisons, PCV13 serotype 3 immune responses will be excluded as 
the immunological profile of serotype 3 is not consistent with the performance of other PCV13 vaccine 
serotypes. Amendment 2 (16 March 2021) aimed to expand the visit windows for Visit 3 (dose 3 
vaccination), Visit 4 (PPS blood draw) and Visit 6 (PTD blood draw) to allow inclusion of more 
participants in the immunogenicity analysis based on the per-protocol population. This change was 
made in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic which impacted the ability of many participants to 
attend study visits within the prescribed visit windows due to local conditions and travel restrictions. 
This amendment also includes the addition of 3 secondary hypotheses relating to the demonstration of 
superiority for serotype 3 immune responses. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 477 (27.7%) participants in the study. Of these, 
239 participants (13.9%) had protocol deviations that were considered clinically important, see Table 
11. The most frequently reported clinically important protocol deviations were related to trial 
procedures (e.g., study vaccination administered outside the protocol-defined window). The protocol 
deviations were comparably distributed between intervention groups.

CHMP’s comment 
The study conduct was overall acceptable. In protocol amendment 1 testing of superiority of the 2 
unique serotypes was moved to a secondary objective, while primary objectives of non-inferiority of 
the 2 unique serotypes to the lowest of any of the shared serotypes were included. The objective of 
non-inferiority is more closely matched to the WHO guideline, which is appreciated. It ensures that any 
immune response generated by the 2 unique serotypes is substantial and potentially clinically relevant. 
In addition, the newly proposed primary endpoint is considered more stringent, as superiority of the 
new serotypes compared to PCV13, and in effect placebo for these serotypes, is more easily achieved 
than non-inferiority to any of the shared serotypes. The addition of 2 secondary endpoints 
investigating the superiority of serotype 3 during protocol amendment 2 is acceptable. Testing for 
superiority once non-inferiority has been demonstrated is acceptable. As both amendments were 
implemented prior to the last visit and database lock it would not affect the type I error. 
The visit windows for Visit 3 (dose 3 vaccination) was extended by 14 days and the visit windows for 
Visit 4 (PPS blood draw) and Visit 6 (PTD blood draw) were expanded by 18 days. As this was done for 
both treatment arms, this is not expected to affect the difference between arms if the distribution of 
visits later in the window was comparable over the arms. It could potentially impact the induction and 
measurement of the immune response, however, considering the relatively short expansion of the 
window by 14 to 18 days no clinically relevant impact is expected. 
The MAH has comprehensively monitored the protocol deviations. Important protocol deviations were 
reported by in total 239 participants (13.9%) during the study, most of which were deviations in trial 
procedures, with study vaccination administered outside protocol-defined window being most 
commonly reported, for 7.1% in the V114 group vs 5.9% in the PCV13 group, followed by blood drawn 
outside protocol-defined window, for 4.9% in the V114 group vs 5.9% in the PCV13 group. The 
percentage of clinically important protocol deviations were comparable between the V114 and PCV13 
group (14.1% versus 13.7%).  
Baseline data 
Although the proportions of participants by race and ethnicity varied across the studies due to the 
countries where these studies were conducted, the demographic characteristics were generally 
comparable between intervention groups in each study, see Table 12.  
In study V114-025, the median age of participants at the time of consent was 8.0 weeks (range: 6 to 
12 weeks). Approximately half of the participants were male, most participants were White; and the 
majority of participants were of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Approximately 6% of participants 
were preterm born infants (<37 weeks gestational age at birth). 
In study V114-029, the median age of participants at the time of consent was 8.0 weeks (range: 6 to 
12 weeks). Approximately 52% of the participants were male; 55% were white, and 26% were Asian. 
The majority (>74%) of participants were of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Approximately 9% of 
participants were preterm born infants (gestational age <37 weeks).

The baseline characteristics in the pivotal studies were balanced across treatment groups in both studies. 
Both studies were comparable with respect to gender and age of the participants included. Differences 
were  observed  concerning  race  and  ethnicity,  reflective  of  the  countries  in  which  the  studies  were 
performed. However, the included population seems to be sufficiently representative for the European 
population.   
Overall, the intended population is well represented.   
Numbers analysed 
For both studies primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the per protocol (PP) 
population, with supportive immunogenicity analyses conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) 
population for the primary immunogenicity endpoints and secondary immunogenicity endpoints that 
were associated with a hypothesis test.

CHMP’s comment 
The definitions of the analysis populations are acceptable.  
Of all subjects randomized, most exclusions from the IgG analysis are observed at 30 days post primary 
series, and slightly more exclusions were present in the PCV13 group, with 88% versus 84% included 
for  V114  and  PCV13  for  study  V114-025  and  82%  versus  77%  for  study  V114-029  included.  A  very 
strong  relation  between  exclusion  from  the  IgG  analysis  and  the  immunogenicity  results  is  unlikely, 
therefore major impact of the disbalance on the immunogenicity results is unlikely.

Outcomes and estimation 
V114-025 
Primary Immunogenicity endpoints 
As can be observed in Figure 1, V114 met noninferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes and met 
superiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes (22F and 33F), as assessed by the proportions of 
participants meeting the IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL (response rates) at 30 days PTD in the 
per protocol population.  
Figure 1 
Forest Plot of the Proportions of Participants With IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 Days 
Post Toddler Dose (PP population) – V114-025 
Serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days PTD in the FAS population were consistent with those 
observed in the PP population.

V114 met noninferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes and superiority criteria for the 2 unique 
serotypes (22F and 33F) as assessed by the serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD. 
Figure 2 
Forest Plot of IgG GMC Ratios at 30 Days Post Toddler Dose (PP) - V114-025 
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD in the FAS population were consistent with those observed 
in the PP population. In addition, when only full-term infants are analysed, the resulst are consistent 
with the overall PP population. 
The distribution of immune responses at 30 days PTD (as displayed by RCDCs) was generally 
comparable between intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher for the 2 unique 
serotypes (22F and 33F) in the V114 group, consistent with the results observed for serotype-specific 
IgG GMCs. 
CHMP’s comment 
The primary immunogenicity objectives were met as non-inferiority to PCV13 for the 13 shared 
serotypes and superiority for the 2 unique serotypes in V114 were shown at 30 days PTD both for IgG 
response rate and IgG GMCs.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 47/150 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Excluding serotype 3, 30 days PTD, >95% of participants had achieved an IgG threshold value of 
≥0.35 µg/mL for the 12 shared serotypes in the V114 group compared to >97% of participants in the 
PCV13 group. For serotype 3, 92.0% of participants achieved an IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL 
in the V114 group compared to 83.8% in the PCV13 group. These results indicate that for the shared 
serotypes, the response rate was comparable between the V114 and PCV13 group 30 days post toddler 
dose. The surrogate of protection was achieved by the vast majority of participants indicating good 
protection against IPD. 
For the 2 unique serotypes, as expected the response rate was significantly higher in the V114 group 
compared to the PCV13 group, with >99% of participants achieving an IgG threshold value of 
≥0.35 µg/mL in the V114 group, compared to <6% in the PCV13 group. The response rate of >99% 
for both unique serotypes is not worse than the lowest response rate seen in the PCV13 group for the 
13 shared serotypes. These results indicate a substantial immune response is generated for the 2 
unique serotypes, which is likely to offer protection against IPD. 
Analysis performed using the FAS population, provided similar results to the analysis performed on the 
PP population, indicating robustness of the results. In addition, the results including only full-term 
infants are comparable with the overall PP population. Considering that only full-term infants actually 
received the 2-dose primary series, the MAH was asked to include only full-term infants in the 
presentation of the immunogenicity data on the 2-dose primary series in the SmPC in section 5.1. The 
MAH has complied to the request.  
Excluding serotype 3, 30 days PTD, the IgG GMCs ranged from 1.29 to 5.26 for the 12 shared 
serotypes in the V114 group compared to 1.73 to 7.04 in the PCV13 group, leading to GMC ratios that 
ranged from 0.62 to 0.95. For serotype 3, the IgG GMC in the V114 group was 0.88 compared to 0.62 
in the PCV13 group. These results indicate that even though the non-inferiority margin of ≥0.5 was 
met for all 13 shared serotypes as assessed by the serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD that 
IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD were lower in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group (Figure 2). Only 
serotype 3 and 6B had an upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI that did contain 1.00. Four of the shared 
serotypes, 1, 5, 6A and 9V, had a lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI that was lower than 0.67. For all 
serotypes the IgG GMCs were well above 0.35 µg/mL. As there is only a surrogate of protection 
available for IPD and not for pneumonia or AOM it is difficult to interpret the clinical impact of these 
lower titres on the protection against pneumonia and AOM. Especially considering the fact that for 
protection against pneumonia and AOM higher antibody responses are thought to be necessary 
compared to protection against IPD as the protection should take place at the mucosal level or the ear 
instead of blood. There is an ongoing AOM vaccine-efficacy clinical trial, which will evaluate the efficacy 
of V114 in preventing vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal AOM. In addition, PSURs, including information 
on breakthrough disease/vaccine failure, serotype distribution and incidence of IPD will provide an 
indication on efficacy against the new serotypes included in the vaccine, as frequency of IPD caused by 
these serotypes is expected to decline after V114 uptake. In addition, this will provide insight into 
impact of the lower titers on immune persistence as frequency of IPD is reported per age category.  
For the 2 unique serotypes, as expected the IgG GMCs were substantially higher in the V114 group 
compared to the PCV13 group, with IgG GMCs being 5.98 for serotype 22F and 3.41 for serotype 33F 
in the V114 group compared to 0.08 and 0.07 respectively in the PCV13 group. The IgG GMCs for both 
unique serotypes are higher than the IgG GMCs seen in the PCV13 group for the 13 shared serotypes, 
even excluding serotype 3. This again indicates a substantial immune response for the 2 serotypes, 
which likely confers protection against IPD as the IgG GMCs are above 0.35 µg/mL. For pneumonia and 
AOM the results are more difficult to interpret, however, as the immune response is substantial, it is 
likely that some protection against pneumonia and AOM caused by the 2 unique serotypes is still 
achieved.

CHMP’s comment 
The noninferiority criteria were met for the immune response to each antigen in both vaccines. The 
immune response to both concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable between the V114 and 
PCV13 group, indicating that the generation of the immune response was not impacted differently by 
the 2 vaccines.  
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: Responses at 30 days PPS 
Serotype-specific IgG response rates and IgG GMCs, see Table 17, were comparable for most of the 
13 shared serotypes between the intervention groups at 30 days PPS. Serotype-specific IgG response 
rates and IgG GMCs were higher for the 2 unique serotypes (22F and 33F) in V114 recipients 
compared with PCV13 recipients at 30 days PPS.

Figure 3 
Forest Plot of the Proportions of Participants With IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 Days 
Post Primary – V114-025 
CHMP’s comment 
At 30 days PPS, for the 13 shared serotypes the proportion of participants achieving IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL 
ranged from 57.3% (serotype 6B) to 98.9% (serotype 19F) in the V114 group compared to the range 
from 52.7% (serotype 6B) to 99.4% (serotype 19F) in the PCV13 group. Noninferiority criteria were 
met for all serotypes except 6A, as the percentage point difference between V114 and PCV13 was -
19.4, with even the upper bound of the confidence interval below -10% (-23.9, -15.0). The response 
rate to serotype 3 was higher in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group (25.7 (21.1, 30.3). As 
expected the response rate for the 2 unique serotypes was higher in the V114 group compared to the 
PCV13 group, with response rate for 22F being 95.6% vs 5.2% and for 33F being 48.7% vs 2.8%. The 
response rate for the 2 unique serotypes fell within the 10% difference for the lowest response rate in 
the PCV13 group (48.7% for serotype 33F in the V114 compared to 52.7% for serotype 6B in the 
PCV13 group). Of note, for serotype 33F the response rate and IgG GMC observed at 30 days PPS are 
much lower compared to 30 days PTD. The fact that the mean (0.31 µg/mL) is slightly less than 0.35 
µg/mL is in line with the proportion of participants achieving ≥0.35 µg/mL being less than 50%; the 
observed response rate being 48.7%. 
Similarly, the noninferiority criteria for IgG GMCs were met for all shared serotypes except serotype 
6A, with GMC ratio V114/PCV13 ranging from 0.75 (serotype 14) to 1.85 (serotype 3). The GMC ratio 
for serotype 6A was 0.45 (0.40, 0.52). The clinical impact of the reduced IgG GMCs for serotype 6A is 
likely limited as the percentage of participants achieving the IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL was 
93.7% in the V114 compared to 98.6% in the PCV13 group at 30 days PPS. For the 2 unique 
serotypes, the IgG GMCs were higher in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group: for 22F the 
IgG GMCs were 2.76 vs 0.05 and for 33F 0.31 vs 0.05.

Immune Responses over time: IgG GMCs 
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotypes declined from 30 days PPS to the pretoddler 
dose, and then increased from the pretoddler dose to 30 days PTD, at levels higher than those 
measured at 30 days PPS for most serotypes in both intervention groups, see Table 18. The pattern of 
serotype-specific immune responses over time was comparable in both groups for most of the 13 
shared serotypes. 
In the V114 group, IgG GMCs for the unique serotype 22F declined from 30 days PPS to the pretoddler 
dose, and then increased from the pretoddler dose to 30 days PTD, see Table 18. In the V114 group, 
serotype 33F increased from 30 days PPS and the pretoddler dose, and then increased from the 
pretoddler dose to 30 days PTD. Minimal changes in immune responses to these serotypes 22F and 
33F were observed in the PCV13 group.

CHMP’s comment 
For all serotypes the IgG GMCs decreased over time from 30 days PPS to pre-toddler dose, except 33F 
in the V114 group. This potentially indicates that for serotype 33F the peak immune response has not 
been reached at 30 days post primary series. A slow immune response has been observed in literature 
for serotype 6B (Spijkerman et al. JAMA 2013, Zhao et al. Front Microbiol 2022). OPA GMTs also 
showed an increase in the V114 group, pointing to natural exposure, however, no such increase was 
seen in the PCV13 group as would have been expected since exposure would be expected to occur in 
similar rates for both treatment arms. Therefore, this requires and explanation by the MAH, which 
should include a discussion on timing of the measurement as it might be that immune response to 33F 
still increases after 30 days.  
The results indicate that as expected, for most serotypes, antibody concentration decreases over time. 
The toddler dose has a substantial impact and increases IgG GMCs to levels comparable to or higher 
than PPS. This indicates that immune memory is generated. 
When looking at the RCDCs of the 13 shared serotypes, all serotypes showed a similar pattern for the 
V114 group and the PCV13 group, although the curves for V114 generally fall below the curve for 
PCV13. Visually, the curves are comparable, indicating that the response induced in both groups is 
comparable. It is also clear that the threshold level of 0.35 µg/mL is achieved by the majority of 
participants both PPS and PTD for most serotypes. In addition, the data of the RCDCs indicate that IgG 
concentrations decline at a similar rate after vaccination with V114 and PCV13 and consequently also 
the response rates. Given that the initial concentrations were lower with V114, it could be assumed 
that the protective effect of V114 might wane earlier compared to PCV13. Since no data after a longer 
period are available, this issue can currently not be answered but has to be referred to post marketing. 
In conclusion, V114 generates an immune response that achieves the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL, both 
PPS and PTD for all serotypes for the majority of patients. For 11 out of the 13 shared serotypes, the 
response achieved in the V114 group is lower compared to the response in the PCV13 group. As the 
response is somewhat lower compared to PCV13, more serotypes (8 vs 5) fall below the threshold of 
0.35 µg/mL immediately prior to the toddler dose. The clinical impact of this is unknown. After the 
toddler dose, a substantial immune response is generated in both arms, and the IgG GMCs levels 
generated are comparable to or higher than levels achieved PPS.    
Immune Responses over time: Functional antibodies over time 
The pattern of functional immune responses (as assessed by serotype-specific OPA responses) over 
time and the distribution of OPA titres (as displayed by RCDCs) were generally comparable between 
intervention groups and were consistent with that observed for serotype-specific IgG responses, see 
Table 19.

a The within-group CIs are obtained by exponentiating the CIs of the mean of the natural log values based on the t-
distribution. N=Number of participants randomized and vaccinated; n=Number of participants contributing to the 
analysis. 
Note: Per protocol, the final dose of the primary series was administered at ~4 months of age, and the toddler 
dose was administered at ~11 to 15 months of age. 
CI=confidence interval; GMT=geometric mean titer (1/dil); OPA=opsonophagocytic activity. 
CHMP’s comment 
Opsonophagocytic antibodies are functional antibodies capable of opsonizing pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharides for presentation to phagocytic cells for engulfment and subsequent killing. No correlate 
of protection is known for OPA antibodies in children, therefore the clinical impact of the response 
induced is unknown.

It is agreed with the MAH that overall, the results of OPA GMTs are consistent with the results as 
observed for IgG GMCs.  
OPA GMTs decrease over time from PPS to pretoddler dose for all serotypes, except 33F. After the 
toddler dose an increase in OPA GMTs was seen for all serotypes. PTD, OPA GMTs increased over the 
levels observed PPS for all serotypes in both treatment groups. This indicates that immune memory is 
present. 
When comparing OPA GMTs between V114 and PCV13 at PPS, the OPA titers of the 13 shared 
serotypes were generally comparable between the 2 treatment arms. Immediately prior to the toddler 
dose, OPA GMTs were substantially decreased from PPS for all serotypes. PTD, levels increased and 
were comparable between the 2 treatment arms for 9 out of 13 shared serotypes. Four serotypes, 6A, 
7F, 19A and 23F, were somewhat lower in the V114 arm compared to the PCV13 arm. Interestingly, no 
difference was observed between the 2 treatment arms in OPA GMTs for serotype 3. 
An increase in OPA titers from 30 days PPS to immediately prior to toddler dose for serotype 33F was 
observed in the PCV13 group, which is not reflected in an increase in IgG GMCs. No clear explanation 
exists, however, it could be related to non-specific background interference in combination with 
increasing IgM due to maturation of the immune system. The observed increase is several magnitudes 
lower than the response seen in the V114 group. Finally, no further substantial increase is seen 
between pre-toddler dose and toddler dose. For all other serotypes there is a correlation between IgG 
GMCs and OPA titers, as when IgG GMCs decrease, the OPA GMTs also decrease and vice versa. 
The OPA GMTs for the 2 unique serotypes in the V114 group were consistently higher compared to the 
PCV13 arm, which is to be expected. The OPA GMTs for the 2 unique serotypes were higher compared 
to the OPA GMTs for serotypes 1 and 5, indicating that a robust response was generated.  
V114-029 
Primary Immunogenicity endpoints 
V114 met noninferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes as assessed by the proportions of 
participants meeting the IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL (response rates) for each serotype at 30 
days PPS (post dose 3). V114 met noninferiority criteria for the 2 unique serotypes as assessed by the 
response rate for serotypes 22F and 33F compared with the response rate for serotype 23F (lowest 
response rate of the shared serotypes in PCV13, excluding serotype 3) at 30 days PPS. 
Serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD in the FAS population were 
consistent with those observed in the PP population.

Forest Plot of IgG GMC Ratios at 30 Days PPS (Left) and 30 Days PTD (Right) 
(PP) – V114-029 
CHMP’s comment 
At 30 days PPS, non-inferiority to PCV13 was shown based on IgG response rate for all serotypes and 
for 14 out of 15 serotypes (excluding serotype 6A) based on IgG GMC ratio. At 30 days PTD, all 
serotypes were non-inferior to PCV13 based on IgG GMCs. In principle the study failed, as the primary 
objectives were not all met, as IgG GMC for serotype 6A did not meet non-inferiority criteria based on 
IgG GMCs at 30 days PPS. However, as stated in the WHO guideline non-inferiority to antibody 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 59/150 
 
 
 
  
 
 
response for each of the serotypes in the registered vaccine at both response rate and IgG GMCs is 
desirable, but not an absolute requirement.  
At 30 days PPS, the vast majority of participants achieved the surrogate of protection in both 
treatment arms, indicating adequate protection against IPD. The proportion of participants achieving 
≥0.35 µg/mL was comparable in both groups. The immune response generated by the 2 unique 
serotypes was also comparable to the lowest response rate generated by PCV13 (excluding serotype 
3), which indicates a substantial immune response is generated which is likely to offer protection 
against IPD. 
At 30 days PPS, the IgG GMC for serotype 6A in the V114 was 1.55 and 2.95 in the PCV13 group. This 
IgG GMC is still well above the 0.35 µg/mL threshold and is even higher compared to the response for 
other serotypes such as serotype 4 and 23F. The GMC ratio at 30 days PPS indicated that the immune 
response generated for each of the shared serotypes was lower in the V114 group compared to the 
response generated by PCV13, except for serotype 3, with the ratios ranging from 0.52 (serotype 6A) 
to 0.95 (serotype 4) and 1.73 (serotype 3). This is expected based on the fact that more serotypes are 
included in the vaccine, however, it does raise the question of immune persistence. For the 2 unique 
serotypes, the IgG GMCs were 4.91 for 22F and 1.67 for 33F, both of which were higher compared to 
the lowest IgG GMCs, serotype 4, of PCV13. For all serotypes the IgG GMCs were well above 
0.35 µg/mL. As stated previously, there is only a surrogate of protection in place for IPD and not for 
pneumonia or AOM. This hampers the interpretation of the clinical impact of these lower titres on the 
protection against pneumonia and AOM. Especially considering the fact that for protection against AOM 
higher antibody responses are thought to be necessary compared to protection against IPD. 
At 30 days PTD (dose 4), all serotypes met the non-inferiority margin and GMC ratios ranged from 
0.60 to 0.85 for 12 of the shared serotypes, excluding serotype 3 (GMC ratio 1.35 [1.25, 1.46]). The 
IgG GMCs for the 2 unique serotypes are higher compared to the lowest response seen for PCV13 
(excluding serotype 3). For all serotypes the IgG GMCs were well above 0.35 µg/mL. This indicates 
that after the 4th dose the immune response generated by V114 is comparable to the one generated by 
PCV13 for all serotypes. 
The FAS population showed similar results as the PP population, indicating consistency and robustness 
of the results. 
Overall, at both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD the IgG GMC was well above the threshold of 
0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes in both treatment arms, indicating a substantial immune response that is 
likely to confer protection. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: concomitant vaccines

CHMP’s comment 
The noninferiority criteria were met for the immune response to each antigen in all concomitantly 
administered vaccines. However, as the study formally failed to achieve the predefined primary 
endpoint, formally no further testing of secondary endpoints is justified.

The immune response to the concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable between the V114 
and PCV13 group, indicating that the generation of the immune response was not impacted differently 
by the 2 treatment arms. All responses for the concomitant vaccines showed a within 5 percentage 
points difference between the treatment arms. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: PCV 
V114 elicited immune responses that were higher than PCV13 for the 2 unique serotypes 22F and 33F 
and for shared serotype 3. 
-  V114 met the superiority criteria for serotypes 22F and 33F as assessed by the proportions of 
participants with IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL (response rates) for each serotype at 30 days PD3, as the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in response rates (V114 minus PCV13) 
was greater than 10 percentage points for each serotype. 
-  V114 met the superiority criteria for serotypes 22F and 33F as assessed by the 
serotypespecific IgG GMC at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD. The lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% CI for serotypespecific IgG GMC ratio (V114/PCV13 was greater than 2.0 for each 
serotype. 
-  V114 met the superiority criteria for serotype 3 as assessed by the proportion of participants 
with IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 days PPS. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in response rates (V114 minus PCV13) was greater than 0 percentage points. 
-  V114 met the superiority criteria for serotype 3 as assessed by the serotype-specific IgG GMCs 
at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the serotype-
specific IgG GMC ratio (V114/PCV13) was greater than 1.2. 
CHMP’s comment 
The immune response generated by V114 for the 2 unique serotypes is substantial. For both 
serotypes, at IgG GMCs reached the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, with 
the vast majority (>87%) of participants achieving this threshold at both timepoints in the V114 
group. It is acknowledged that this response was not generated by PCV13, as these serotypes are not 
included in PCV13. 
The higher response to serotype 3 in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group is acknowledged, 
as a greater proportion of participants achieve the threshold value of 0.35 µg/mL at both 30 days PPS 
and 30 day PTD compared to PCV13. However, as the study formally failed to achieve the predefined 
primary endpoint, no further statistical testing of secondary endpoints is justified. Secondary endpoints 
should be descriptive.  
Considering no correlate of protection exists for the new serotypes, the clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown.  
Immune Responses over time: IgG  
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotypes declined from PD3 to predose 4 as expected, 
and subsequently increased from predose 4 to PD4, at levels higher than those measured at 30 days 
PD3 for most serotypes in both intervention groups. The pattern of serotype-specific immune 
responses over time were comparable between the intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report

In the V114 group, IgG GMCs for serotypes 22F and 33F declined from PD3 to predose 4, and 
increased from predose 4 to PD4 [Table 20]. Minimal responses were seen in the PCV13 group.

CHMP’s comment 
For all serotypes the IgG GMCs decreased over time from 30 days post dose 3, PPS, to pre-toddler 
dose. Thirty days after the toddler dose, the IgG GMCs achieved levels similar to PPS or higher in both 
treatment arms. This indicates that immune memory is generated.

At 30 days post toddler dose, the response rate in the V114 group for the 13 shared serotypes is 
comparable, within 5% difference, to the PCV13 group, except for serotype 3 which is higher in the 
V114 group. The response rate for the 2 new serotypes is higher in the V114 group compared to the 
PCV13 group and is with ≥98.9% comparable to the the 13 shared serotypes. Although the high 
response rate for the 2 new serotypes is considered reassuring, the clinical relevance is unknown and 
can only be further investigated in post marketing studies. The data on the response rate at 30 days 
PTD is considered relevant for the prescribers and upon request have been included in the SmPC. 
When looking at the RCDCs of the 13 shared serotypes, all serotypes showed a similar pattern for the 
V114 group and the PCV13 group, although the curves for V114 generally fell below the curve for 
PCV13. Visually, the curves are comparable, indicating that the groups respond comparable. It is also 
clear that the threshold level of 0.35 µg/mL is achieved by the majority of participants PPS, which also 
holds true PTD (not shown). In addition, since the initial immune response induced by V114 is reduced 
compared to the response induced by PCV13, it could be assumed that the protective effect of V114 
might wane earlier compared to PCV13, given that the decline in antibodies appears similar in both 
groups. The issue of persistence of protection can currently not be answered and has to be referred to 
post marketing. 
In conclusion, V114 generates an immune response that achieves the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL, both 
PPS and PTD, for all serotypes for the majority of patients. For 12 out of the 13 shared serotypes 
(exception: serotype 3), the response achieved in the V114 group is lower compared to the response 
in the PCV13 group. As the response is somewhat lower compared to PCV13, more serotypes (4 vs 2) 
fall below the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL immediately prior to the toddler dose. The clinical impact of this 
is unknown. After the toddler dose, a substantial immune response is generated in both arms, and the 
IgG GMCs levels generated are comparable to or higher than levels achieved PPS.    
Immune Responses over time: Functional antibodies  
The pattern of functional immune responses over time, as assessed by serotype-specific OPA 
responses, was generally comparable between the intervention groups and was consistent with that 
observed for serotype-specific IgG responses.

CHMP’s comment 
The results of the functional OPA antibodies are consistent with the results as observed for IgG GMCs, 
which is appreciated. No correlate of protection is known for OPA antibodies in children, therefore the 
clinical impact of the response induced is unknown.  
In the V114 group, OPA GMTs decrease over time from PPS to pretoddler dose for all serotypes. After 
the toddler dose an increase in OPA GMTs was seen for all serotypes. PTD, OPA GMTs increased over 
the levels observed PPS for all serotypes in both treatment groups. This indicates that immune 
memory is present. 
When comparing OPA GMTs between V114 and PCV13 at PPS, the OPA titres of the 13 shared 
serotypes were generally comparable between the 2 treatment arms. Immediately prior to the toddler 
dose, OPA GMTs were substantially decreased from PPS for all serotypes, except for serotype 33F in 
the PCV13 group. PTD, levels increased and were comparable between the 2 treatment arms for 10 out 
of 13 shared serotypes. Three serotypes, 9V, 19A and 23F, were somewhat lower in the V114 arm 
compared to the PCV13 arm. Interestingly, no difference in serotype 3 OPA antibodies was seen 
between V114 and PCV13 30 days PTD. 
An increase in OPA titres from 30 days PPS to immediately prior to toddler dose was observed for 
serotype 33F in the PCV13 group, which is not reflected in an increase in IgG GMCs. No clear 
explanation exists, however, it could be related to non-specific background interference in combination 
with increasing IgM due to maturation of the immune system. The observed increase is several 
magnitudes lower than the response seen in the V114 group. In addition, no further substantial 
increase is seen between pre-toddler dose and toddler dose. For all other serotypes there is a 
correlation between IgG GMCs and OPA titres, as when IgG GMCs decrease, the OPA GMTs also 
decrease and vice versa.

The OPA GMTs for the 2 unique serotypes in the V114 group were consistently higher compared to the 
PCV13 arm, which is to be expected. The OPA GMTs for the 2 unique serotypes were higher compared 
to the lowest OPA GMTs, serotype 1, indicating that a robust response was generated.

V114-025 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint was summarized by intervention group for each subgroup with 
≥5% of the total number of randomized participants in each intervention group. Serotype-specific IgG 
response rates and GMCs at 30 days PTD for all 15 serotypes in male and female participants, in the 
race subgroup (White) and in ethnicity subgroups (Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic or Latino) were 
consistent with the results observed in the overall population, an example for sex is provided in Figure 
13.

Figure 14  Forest Plot of IgG GMC Ratios at 30 Days Postdose 3 by Sex (PP) – V114-029 
CHMP’s comment 
In both pivotal studies, it was shown that V114 was immunogenic in both male and female participants 
as assessed by IgG GMCs and response rates for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine 30 days PPS 
and IgG GMCs 30 days PTD. The forest plots and IgG GMCs of female and male participants were 
largely comparable to the overall PP population. Although slight differences could be observed, no clear 
trend was seen. The same holds true for the subgroups for race and ethnicity, as slight differences in 
immune response could be observed between the subgroups, however no clear trends were observed. 
For study V114-025 no subgroup analyses for race other than White was performed, as for other races 
the threshold of ≥5% of participants was not met. 
Overall, the results of the subgroup analyses are consistent with results observed with other 
vaccinations and do not raise concerns. 
Of note, term/preterm will be discussed separately in the analysis performed across trials.

V114 met noninferiority criteria for the 13 shared serotypes, as assessed by the 
proportions of participants meeting the threshold value of ≥0.35 μg/mL (response 
rate) and serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD.  
V114 met superiority criteria for the 2 serotypes (22F and 33F) unique to V114, as 
assessed by response rate and serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PTD.  
Thirty days PTD, excluding serotype 3, the proportion of participants achieving 0.35 
μg/mL was >95% in the V114 compared to >97% in the PCV13 group. For serotype 
3, 92.0% of participants were responders, compared to 83.8% in the PCV13 group. 
For the 2 unique serotypes, >99% of participants were responders compared to <6% 
in the PCV13 group. 
For the 13 shared serotypes, except serotype 3, IgG GMCs were lower in the V114 
group compared to the PCV13 group. For 11 out of 13 shared serotypes the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI did not contain 1.00. The IgG GMCs for the 2 unique 
serotypes were substantially higher in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group. 
For all serotypes the IgG GMCs were well above 0.35 µg/mL and the vast majority of 
participants achieved this threshold indicating protection against IPD. As there is only 
a surrogate of protection in place for IPD and not for pneumonia or AOM it is difficult 
to interpret the clinical impact of these lower titres on the protection against 
pneumonia and AOM.

Immune responses to INFANRIX™ hexa administered concomitantly with V114 
met noninferiority criteria, as assessed by the proportions of participants meeting 
the antigen-specific response rate to each antigen in INFANRIX™ hexa at 30 days 
PTD.  
Immune response to Rotarix™ administered concomitantly with V114 met 
noninferiority criteria, as assessed by anti-rotavirus IgA GMTs at 30 days PPS. 
Serotype-specific IgG response rates and IgG GMCs were comparable for most of 
the 13 shared serotypes between the intervention groups and were higher for the 
2 unique serotypes (22F and 33F) in V114 recipients compared with PCV13 
recipients at 30 days PPS. 
The pattern of functional immune responses (as assessed by serotype-specific OPA 
responses) over time and the distribution of OPA titers (as displayed by RCDCs) 
were generally comparable between intervention groups and were consistent with 
that observed for serotype-specific IgG responses 
The immune response to both concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable 
between the V114 and PCV13 group, indicating that the generation of the immune 
response was not impacted differently by the 2 vaccines. 
At 30 days PPS, serotype 6A does not meet non-inferiority criteria for both response 
rate and IgG GMCs, as the response rate is 73.2% in the V114 group compared to 
92.6% in the PCV13 group and IgG GMC is 0.64 µg/mL in the V114 group compared 
to 1.42 in the PCV13 group. For all other shared serotypes, non-inferiority criteria are 
met. For all shared serotype the IgG GMCs are well above the threshold of 0.35 
µg/mL. For the 2 unique serotypes, the immune response is higher in the V114 group 
compared to PCV13, with a response rate of 95.6% and 48.7% in the V114 group 
compared to 5.2% and 2.8% in the PCV13 group for 22F and 33F. For 22F IgG GMC 
is above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL, while it is just below, 0.31 µg/mL, for 33F.  
The results of OPA GMTs are consistent with the results as observed for IgG GMCs.

Thirty days PPS, serotype 6A missed the non-inferiority margin as the GMC ratio was 
0.52 (0.48, 0.58). The IgG GMC for serotype 6A in the V114 group was 1.55 and 2.95 
in the PCV13 group, which is well above the surrogate of protection of ≥0.35 µg/mL.  
At both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD the IgG GMC was well above the threshold of 
0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes in both treatment arms, indicating a substantial immune 
response that is likely to confer protection.

Notes 
All responses for the concomitant vaccines showed a within 5 percentage points

The clinical relevance of meeting the superiority criteria for both the 2 unique 
serotypes and serotype 3 is unknown. 
The results of the functional OPA antibodies are consistent with the results as

A side-by-side display of immunogenicity responses obtained during studies V114-025, V114-029, 
V114-008 and V114-027, conducted in healthy infants approximately 2 months of age, is presented 
below. A more detailed description of Study V114-008 and V114-027 is presented in the section 
supportive studies. 
Although the proportions of participants by race and ethnicity varied across the studies due to the 
countries where these studies were conducted, the demographic characteristics were generally 
comparable between intervention groups in each study, see Table 25. Across the studies, the median 
age at enrolment was 8.0 or 9.0 weeks. Approximately half of the participants were female; the 
majority (≥55%) of participants were White across the studies and >20% of participants were Asian in 
V114-029 and V114-027. The majority (>74%) of participants were of non-Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity.

Across the 4 studies, serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days PPS varied between serotypes, 
with the lowest responses observed in study V114-025, where the majority of participants received 2 
doses of PCV in the primary series. 
The differences in response rates between the V114 and PCV13 groups at 30 days PPS and 30 days 
PTD were generally consistent across studies in participants receiving a 3- or 4-dose regimen of PCV, 
see Figure 15 and Figure 16.

Across the 4 studies, V114 elicited serotype-specific immune responses to all 15 serotypes included in 
the vaccine when administered as a 3-dose or 4-dose series, as assessed by IgG GMCs at 30 days PPS, 
pretoddler dose, and at 30 days PTD, see Figure 16 and Figure 17. Serotype-specific IgG GMC ratios 
(V114/PCV13) at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD were generally consistent in healthy infants receiving 3 
or 4 doses of PCV.

CHMP’s comment 
Data from healthy infants was compared across 4 clinical studies: V114-025, V114-029, V114-027 and 
V114-008.  
The  design  of  the  4  studies  was  similar,  except  for  the  number  of  doses  given.  All  studies  were 
randomized, double-blind, PCV13 controlled, multicenter studies. The studies all enrolled healthy infants 
approximately 2 months of age. During study V114-025 3 doses (2 in the primary series and 1 toddler 
dose) of PCV were administered compared to 4 doses (3 in the primary series and 1 toddler dose) in the 
rest of the studies. 
A  consistent  immune  response  was  observed  across  studies,  as  the  forest  plots  all  showed  a  similar 
pattern for all studies for both IgG response rate and GMC ratio. The results of studies V114-027 and 
V114-008 were consistent with the results of pivotal studies V114-025 and V114-029. V114 generated 
an immune response to all 15 serotypes included in the vaccine. At 30 days PTD, the IgG response rate 
for all serotypes was ≥92% in the V114 group in all studies. 
The lowest immune response is seen in study V114-025. At 30 days PPS, the IgG response rate of the 
13 shared serotypes ranged from 57.3% to 98.9% in study V114-025 compared to 88.6% to 99.0% in 
study V114-029, 95.2% to 100.0% in study V114-027 and 91.4% to 99.5% in study V114-008. As at 
30 days PPS, GMC ratios were comparable across the 4 studies. This indicates that while V114 generated 
the lowest immune response in study V114-025, the same holds true for PCV13. 
It has been noted that the number of subjects using paracetamol concomitantly is much higher in both 
pivotal  studies  compared  to  the  other  studies  (025:  ~48%,  029:  ~67%,  027:  ~6%,  008:  no  use  of 
paracetamol). Although the use of paracetamol was overall balanced between groups in all respective 
studies, further discussion was requested based on post marketing findings with PCV13 indicating that 
the  prophylactic  use  of  antipyretics  (ibuprofen  and  paracetamol)  reduced  the  immune  response 
especially after the primary series. The presented results of subgroup analyses based on concomitant 
antipyretic use (yes/no) are similar for both vaccines, indicating a similar effect for both vaccines. The

potential  influence  of  prophylactic  use  of  antipyretics  (ibuprofen  and  paracetamol)  on  the  immune 
response, as observed in the postmarketing of PCV13, can consequently not be ruled out and respective 
wording in the SmPC is required. 
Overall, these results indicate that V114 induces a slightly lower immune response compared to PCV13 
for the majority of the shared serotypes, as evidenced by the GMC ratio that is below 1. However, the 
immune  response  is  high  enough  to  ensure  that  the  threshold  of  0.35  µg/mL  is  achieved  by  most 
participants.  
Preterm Infants 
Four Phase 3 clinical studies (V114-025, V114-027, V114-029, and V114-031) included in the V114 
paediatric submission package evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 in 
healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, including preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age at birth), 
see Table 26.

The majority (>85%) of preterm infants in the V114 group achieved the IgG threshold value of 
≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 days PPS and nearly all (>96%) achieved IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 30 days PTD for 
each of the 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine: 
•  Serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD were generally 
comparable between the V114 and PCV13 intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes and 
higher in the V114 group for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 (22F and 33F), see Table 29. 
•  Serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD in the FAS population 
were consistent with those observed for the PP population.

In preterm infants, V114 elicited serotype-specific immune responses to all 15 serotypes included in 
the vaccine when administered as a 4-dose series, as assessed by IgG GMCs at 30 days PPS, 
pretoddler dose, and at 30 days PTD: 
•  Serotype-specific IgG GMCs and the distribution of serotype-specific IgG concentrations (as 
displayed by the RCDCs, see Figure 19 and Figure 20) for each time point were generally 
comparable between the V114 and PCV13 intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes and 
higher for serotypes 22F and 33F in V114 recipients. 
•  Serotype-specific IgG GMCs for each time point in the FAS population were consistent with 
those observed for the PP population. 
•  The immune responses observed to all 15 serotypes in the subset of preterm infants were 
consistent with those observed in the overall healthy infant population (including preterm and 
term infants) receiving 3 or 4 doses of V114. 
In preterm infants, V114 induced an immune memory response following the primary series as 
supported by the following pattern of vaccine-induced immune responses: 
•  Serotype-specific IgG GMCs decreased from 30 days PPS to pretoddler dose, and subsequently 
increased at 30 days PTD to levels higher than those measured at 30 days PPS for most of the 
15 serotypes in the V114 group, see Table 30. 
•  The pattern of serotype-specific immune responses over time were generally comparable 
between the V114 and PCV13 intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes.

CHMP’s comment 
Data from pre-term infants was integrated across 4 Phase 3 clinical studies: V114-025, V114-029, 
V114-027 and V114-031.  
The design of the 4 studies was similar as they were all randomized, double-blind, PCV13 controlled, 
multicenter studies. Preterm infants in all 4 studies received 4 doses of PCV, with the primary series 
consisting of 3 single doses followed by a toddler dose. However, during study V114-025 PCV was 
administered at ~2, 3, 4, 11 to 15 months of age, while for all other studies administration of PCV was 
performed at ~2, 4, 6, 12 to 15 months of age. 
The number of participants that completed the studies was comparable between the intervention 
groups. 
Both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, the vast majority of participants achieved the threshold value of 
0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes in both treatment arms. Comparable to the total population, the IgG 
GMCs generated by administration of V114 were consistently lower for 12 of the 13 shared serotypes 
compared to the IgG GMCs generated by PCV13. As the starting level of IgG was lower in the V114 
group, pre-toddler dose 5 out of 13 shared serotypes fell below the threshold level compared to 3 out 
of 13 serotypes in the PCV13 group. The clinical impact of this observation is unknown. After the 
toddler dose, a substantial immune response was generated in both treatment arms for all serotypes, 
as for all serotypes the IgG GMCs increased to the level after the primary series or even above that. 
This pattern is comparable to the total population, indicating that a comparable immune response is 
generated in the pre-term infants. However, the lower immune response could impact persistence of 
protection.  
The RCDC curves showed a similar pattern between the 2 treatment arms both pre-toddler dose and 
30 days PTD. 
OPA GMTs showed that V114 was immunogenic. The OPA GMTs generated by V114 were slightly lower 
compared to PCV13 for the shared serotypes, while they were higher in the V114 group for the 2 
additional serotypes. Overall, the OPA responses were comparable to the IgG responses, although the 
higher serotype 3 response induced by V114 in IgG GMCs was not reflected in OPA GMTs.   
Overall, the immune responses in the pre-term infants were largely comparable to the immune 
response seen in the total healthy infant population. As in the total infant population, the IgG GMCs 
generated with V114 were lower compared to the IgG GMCs generated by PCV13 for 12 out of 13 
shared serotypes, and higher for serotype 3, 22F and 33F. Of note, for both vaccines the response 
rates and IgG GMCs were generally higher in preterm infants compared to full term infants. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Sickle Cell Disease 
Study Design: Study V114-023 was a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, 
double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 in children 5 to 
17 years of age (inclusive) with sickle cell disease. 
Treatment: Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 
either V114 or PCV13.  
Study Participants: Eligible participants were healthy males or females between the ages of 5 and 
17 years (inclusive) with a documented diagnosis of sickle cell disease and without a prior history of

invasive pneumococcal disease or prior administration of any pneumococcal vaccine within 3 years of 
study entry. In total 104 participants were enrolled/randomized. 
In the V114 group, 70 participants were randomized, 69 (98.6%) were vaccinated with V114, 65 
(92.9%) completed the study, and 5 (7.1%) discontinued from the study. In the PCV13 and all 
participants completed the study. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were presented 
descriptively. Demographic characteristics were generally comparable in both groups. The median age 
of participants was 11 years (range: 5 to 17 years). The majority of participants were male, Black or 
African American, and of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Reported medical history conditions were as 
expected for a paediatric SCD population and generally comparable in both groups. The 5 most 
frequently reported medical history conditions (by preferred term) were sickle cell anaemia with crisis 
(33%), transfusion (25.2%), pneumonia (16.5%), asthma (16.2%), and acute chest syndrome 
(10.7%). 
Objectives: The objectives of this study were to descriptively (1) evaluate the serotype-specific IgG 
GMCs at 30 days postvaccination for each vaccination group, (2) evaluate the serotype-specific OPA 
GMTs at 30 days postvaccination (Day 30) for each vaccination group, and (3) evaluate serotype-
specific Geometric Mean Fold Rises (GMFRs) from prevaccination (Day 1) to 30 days postvaccination 
(Day 30) for both OPA and IgG responses for each vaccination group. 
Results: 
V114 was immunogenic in children 5 to 17 years of age with SCD as assessed by serotype-specific IgG 
GMCs at 30 days postvaccination for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine, including the 13 
serotypes in common with PCV13 and the 2 serotypes unique to V114 (22F and 33F). Serotype-specific 
IgG GMCs were generally comparable between recipients of V114 and PCV13 for the 13 shared 
serotypes between the 2 vaccines and higher in recipients of V114 than PCV13 for serotypes 22F and 
33F. 
Increases in serotype-specific IgG GMCs between Day 1 and Day 30 were observed in both V114 and 
PCV13 recipients for the 13 shared serotypes. The distribution of immune responses at 30 days 
postvaccination was generally comparable between the intervention groups for the 13 shared 
serotypes and higher for 22F and 33F in V114 recipients, see Table 32.

CI=confidence interval; GMC=geometric mean concentration (µg/mL); GMFR=geometric mean fold-rise; 
IgG=immunoglobulin G; PCV=pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (V114 or PCV13). 
As observed with IgG GMCs, V114 was immunogenic as assessed by OPA GMTs at 30 days 
postvaccination for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine, including the 13 serotypes shared with 
PCV13 and the 2 unique serotypes (22F and 33F) contained in V114. Serotype-specific OPA GMTs were 
generally comparable between recipients of V114 and PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes between the 
2 vaccines and higher in recipients of V114 than PCV13 for serotypes 22F and 33F. 
Increases in serotype-specific OPA GMTs between Day 1 and Day 30 were observed in both V114 and 
PCV13 recipients for the 13 shared serotypes. The distribution of immune responses at 30 days 
postvaccination was generally comparable between the intervention groups for the 13 shared 
serotypes and higher for 22F and 33F in V114 recipients, consistent with the results observed for 
serotype-specific OPA GMTs.

CHMP’s comment 
Study V114-023 was a descriptive study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 
single dose of V114 in children 5 to 17 years of age with sickle cell disease. In total 104 participants 
were enrolled.  
Based on the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, the study was designed to support a recommendation for 
V114 in children with SCD who are either PCV-naïve or who have received a lower valent PCV, 
including Prevenar 13. However, one of the exclusion criteria was that participants had received <3 
doses of PCV, suggesting that there were no pneumococcal-vaccine naïve participants included in the 
study. Therefore, the MAH was asked to clarify whether any pneumococcal-vaccine naïve participants 
were included in the study and whether the study arms were balanced concerning prior pneumococcal 
vaccines. Unfortunately, the pneumococcal vaccination history was not adequately collected in this 
trial. Consequently, no conclusion can be drawn based on pneumococcal vaccination history. 
The percentages of participants aged 5 to 9 were lower in the V114 group while the percentage of 
participants aged 10 to 14 were higher compared to the PCV13 group, indicating a skew in age of the 
participants between the 2 treatment groups. The fact that the mean age of participants in both groups 
was 10.8 years of age with a standard deviation of 3.5 years in the V114 group and 3.3 in the PCV13 
group the difference is not considered to have relevant impact on the results. Slight differences in race 
were also observed, which are probably due to small numbers. 
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in children with sickle cell disease. The immune responses 
generated by V114 and PCV13 were generally comparable. In the V114 group, the proportion of 
patients that achieved a ≥4-fold rise in IgG GMC 30 days postvaccination ranged from 53.0% to 
93.9% for all 15 serotypes. In the PCV13 group the proportion of patients that achieved a ≥4-fold rise 
in IgG GMC 30 days postvaccination ranged from 48.3% to 93.1% for all 13 serotypes included in the 
vaccine. No substantial increase in 22F and 33F IgG GMCs were seen in the PCV13 group, as expected.  
After the single administration of PCV, the IgG GMCs generated were well above the threshold of 
0.35 µg/mL, indicating that the response generated was substantial and clinically relevant. 
The response as measured by OPA GMTs was generally comparable to the response as measured by 
IgG GMCs.  
Overall, the immune response to either V114 or PCV13 was generally comparable in the sickle cell 
disease patients as measured by IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs.  
Interestingly the responses to serotype 6A and 6B appeared to be higher in the V114 group compared 
to the PCV13 group, while the response to serotype 3 was comparable. This might be due to small 
numbers or to prior vaccination, which is difficult to assess due to pooling of patients with different 
prior PCV vaccinations history. 
HIV-1 infected subjects 
Study Design: Study V114-030 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator 
controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 in 
children 6 to 17 years of age (inclusive) living with HIV (CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 cells/µL and a plasma 
HIV ribonucleic acid [RNA] value <50,000 copies/mL tested at screening).  
Treatment: Participants in Study V114-030 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 
V114 or PCV13 on Day 1, followed by a single dose of PPV23 at Week 8. Randomization was stratified 
by CD4+ T-cell count as follows: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 91/150 
 
 
 
  
 
•  Stratum 1: CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 to <500 cells/µL. 
•  Stratum 2: CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/µL.  
Study Participants: The study population consisted of males or females between the ages of 6 to 
17 years (inclusive) living with HIV (CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 cells/µL and a plasma HIV RNA value 
<50,000 copies/mL tested at screening) without a prior history of invasive pneumococcal disease and 
were (1) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) naïve, previously vaccinated with a <13-valent PCV, 
partially vaccinated with PCV13, or had a history of previous PCV13 vaccination ≥3 years before Day 
1; and (2) pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) vaccine naïve or had a history of 1 previous PnPs 
vaccination ≥5 years before Day 1. 
In the V114 group, 203 participants were randomized and vaccinated with V114 and PPV23. All 
participants completed the study. In the PCV13 group, 204 participants were randomized and 
vaccinated with PCV13, 202 (99.0%) were vaccinated with PPV23, 201 (98.5%) completed the study, 
and 3 (1.5%) discontinued from the study. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and CD4+ T-cell 
count, were presented descriptively. The median age was 13 years, ranging from 6 to 17 year. The 
majority of participants were male (52.1%) and not Hispanic or Latino (99.3%). Demographic and 
baseline characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention 
groups. In total, 34 (8.4%) participants with CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 to <500 cells/μL, and 373 
(91.6%) participants with CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/μL were included. The vast majority of 
participants received antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to study entry (99%). In addition, 377 (92.6%) 
of participants were PCV naïve and 406 (99.8%) were PPV23 naïve. 
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs at Day 
30 postvaccination with either V114 or PCV13 in each vaccination group, (2) to evaluate the serotype-
specific OPA GMTs at Day 30 postvaccination with either V114 or PCV13 in each vaccination group, (3) 
to evaluate the serotype-specific OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs at day 30 postvaccination with PPV23 
(Week 12) by each vaccination group.  
Results: 
V114 was immunogenic for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine in children 6 to 17 years of age 
living with HIV. 
Overall, serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days postvaccination with PCV were generally comparable in 
both intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes, and higher for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 
(22F and 33F) in the V114 group compared with the PCV13 group, see Table 33.

CHMP’s comment 
Study V114-030 was an active-comparator controlled, double blind study in HIV-1 infected children. 
Patients either received V114 or PCV13 followed 8 weeks later by PPV23. The vast majority of 
participants included in the study received antiretroviral therapy and had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 
cells/μL. This indicates that the participants still had a functioning immune system.  
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic. The immune response generated by V114 and PCV13 were 
generally comparable and at 30 days after vaccination the IgG GMCs achieved for all serotypes were 
above the threshold value of 0.35 µg/mL in both treatment arms. In the V114 group, the proportion of 
patients that achieved a ≥4-fold rise in IgG GMCs 30 days postvaccination ranged from 41.5% to 
91.7% for all 15 serotypes. In the PCV13 group, the proportion of patients that achieved a ≥4-fold rise 
in IgG GMC 30 days postvaccination ranged from 36.2% to 91.8% for all 13 serotypes. The results for 
OPA GMTs were comparable to the results achieved with IgG GMCs. 
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in both CD4+ T-cell count subgroups (≥200 to <500 
cells/μL, ≥500 cells/μL) as assessed by IgG GMCs 30 days postvaccination. The response in the 
subgroup with CD4+ T-cell counts ≥200 to <500 cells/μL were overall slightly lower compared to the 
total population. 
Overall, the immune response to either V114 or PCV13 was generally comparable in the HIV infected 
participants as measured by IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in the 
V114 group for the 2 unique serotypes. Similar results were observed when looking at the OPA GMTs.  
Following vaccination with PPV23 IgG GMCs at Week 12 were generally comparable with those 
observed at 30 days postvaccination with either V114 or PCV13. As there is no prevaccination 
measurement prior to vaccination with PPV23, the only way to judge whether an immune response 
was elicited is by looking at 22F and 33F in the PCV13 group. An increase in OPA GMT titres was seen

for 22F and 33F in the PCV13 group compared to Day 30, indicating that PPV23 was immunogenic in 
HIV-1 infected participants. 
Supportive studies 
Study V114-024 
Study Design: Study V114-024 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-
controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity catch-up vaccination regimens 
of V114 in healthy infants, children, and adolescents.  
Treatment: Participants in Study V114-024 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 to 3 doses of 
either V114 or PCV13 IM depending on age of enrollment. The intervention groups were as follows:  
-  7 to 11 months of age (PCV-naïve): 3 doses IM, with Dose 1 at randomization, Dose 2 at 4 to 
8 weeks after Dose 1 and Dose 3 at 8 to 12 weeks after Dose 2 and ≥12 months of age. 
-  12 to 23 months of age (PCV naïve): 2 doses IM, with Dose 1 at randomization, and Dose 2 at 
8 to 12 weeks after Dose 1. 
-  2 to 17 years of age (PCV naïve or PCV experienced): Single dose IM administered at 
randomization and at least 8 weeks after previous dose of PCV for participants who were PCV-
experienced.  
Study Participants: The study population will consist of healthy individuals from 7 months to 17 
years of age (inclusive). Participants <2 years of age were to be PCV-naïve. Participants 2 to 17 years 
of age were to be PCV-naïve or to have previously received a partial regimen of licensed PCV (PCV7, 
PCV10, or PCV13) or a full regimen of PCV7 or PCV10. In total 606 subjects were enrolled. 
In the V114 group, 303 participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of V114, 302 
(99.7%) completed the study, and 1 (0.3%) discontinued the study. In the PCV13 group, 303 
participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of PCV13, 303 (100.0%) completed the 
study. 
Demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were presented descriptively. 
Demographic characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention 
groups. No inferential statistics were planned.  
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 
days following the last dose for each vaccination group, and (2) to evaluate serotype-specific IgG 
response rates (proportion of participants meeting serotype-specific IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 
µg/mL) at 30 days following the last dose for each vaccination group. 
Results:  
Catch-up vaccination with V114 elicited serotype-specific immune responses, as assessed by IgG GMCs 
at 30 days following the last dose of study intervention, for all 15 serotypes contained in the vaccine. 
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days following the last dose of study intervention were generally 
comparable between the intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes, see Table 35. IgG GMCs for 
the 2 serotypes unique to V114 (serotypes 22F and 33F) at 30 days following the last dose of study 
intervention were higher in the V114 group than in the PCV13 group.

N=Number of participants randomized and vaccinated; n=Number of participants contributing to the analysis. 
Note: Per protocol, participants 2 to 17 years of age received 1 dose of PCV at Day 1. Day 30 is 30 days following 
vaccination with PCV. 
CI=confidence interval; GMC=geometric mean concentration (μg/mL); IgG=immunoglobulin G; PCV=pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (V114 or PCV13). 
A majority (>83.0%) of participants in the V114 group achieved the IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 
µg/mL at 30 days following the last dose of study intervention for each of the 15 serotypes contained 
in the vaccine. Serotype-specific IgG response rates at 30 days following the last dose of study 
intervention were generally comparable between the intervention groups for the 13 shared serotypes. 
IgG response rates for the 2 serotypes unique to V114 (serotypes 22F and 33F) at 30 days following 
the last dose of study intervention were higher in the V114 group than in the PCV13 group. 
CHMP’s comment 
Study V114-024 investigated the immunogenicity of catch-up vaccination with V114 in children aged 7 
to 11 months, 12 to 23 months and 2 to 17 years of age. The different catch-up schedules were 
documented in an appreciable number of children (n=303; 62-177/group). 
The 3 catch-up vaccination schedules evaluated were: (1) 3 doses for children aged 7 to 11 months, 
with the first 2 doses given 4 to 8 weeks apart, followed by a booster dose 2 dose at least 8 to 12 
weeks after Dose 2 and by at least 12 months of age, (2) 2 doses for children age 12 to 23 months of 
age given at 8 to 12 weeks apart and (3) 1 dose for children 2 to 17 years of age given at least 8 
weeks after any previous dose of PCV for participants who were PCV experienced. These are the 
schedules currently proposed in the SmPC and are similar to the recommended schedules for PCV13 in 
the 3 age groups.

A potential benefit of an additional vaccination with V114 in children previously fully vaccinated with 
PCV7 or PCV10 is difficult to assess, as stratification based on the history of prior PCV vaccination 
status was binary (yes/no), and participants with varied history of PCV vaccination (PCV7, PCV10 or 
PCV13) and different status (partially or fully vaccinated) were pooled together. This binary 
stratification is considered suboptimal, since theoretically more fully vaccinated participants or more 
participants who received higher-valent PCV could have ended up in the V114 arm thereby skewing the 
data. Unfortunately, this could not be assessed, since respective data was not collected. 
The results showed that the proportion of subjects achieving IgG antibody level >0.35 μg/ml after 
vaccination with V114 was high (83.9% to 100%) for all serotypes and for all 3 age groups. This was 
comparable to the response rate seen in the PCV13 groups, which ranged from 87.7% to 100% for all 
serotypes included in the vaccine.  
As seen in the pivotal studies, the IgG GMCs were slightly lower in the V114 group compared to the 
PCV13 group for the majority of the shared serotypes for all 3 age groups. However, in both the V114 
and PCV13 groups the IgG GMCs were well above the threshold level of 0.35 μg/ml for all 15 serotypes 
included in V114 and the 13 serotypes in PCV13. 
Overall, the data suggest that the catch-up schedules induce an immune response that is substantial 
and sufficient to ensure protection against IPD. The response after vaccination with V114 although 
slightly lower is similar to the response seen after vaccination with PCV13. 
Study V114-027 
Study Design: Study V114-027 was a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind 
interchangeability study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of mixed 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) regimens in infants approximately 2 months of age.  
Treatment: Participants in Study V114-024 were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 5 
intervention groups, see Table 36.

Study Participants: The study population will consist of healthy male or female infants approximately 
2 months of age (42 to 90 days, inclusive) without a history of invasive pneumococcal disease or prior 
administration of any pneumococcal vaccine. In total 900 subjects were enrolled. 
In group 1, 179 participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of PCV, 164 (91.6%) 
completed the study, and 15 (8.4%) discontinued the study. In group 2, 181 participants were 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of PCV, 167 (92.3%) completed the study, and 14 (7.7%) 
discontinued the study. In group 3, 180 participants were randomized, 178 (98.9%) received at least

1 dose of PCV, 147 (81.7%) completed the study, and 33 (18.3%) discontinued the study. In group 4, 
180 participants were randomized, 179 (99.4%) received at least 1 dose of PCV, 160 (88.9%) 
completed the study, and 20 (11.1%) discontinued the study. In group 5, 180 participants were 
randomized, 179 (99.4%) received at least 1 dose of PCV, 167 (92.8%) completed the study, and 13 
(7.2%) discontinued the study. 
Demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were presented descriptively. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable across intervention groups. 
The median age of participants at the time of consent was 9.0 weeks (range: 6 to 12 weeks). The 
majority of participants were male, white, and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Approximately 10% 
of participants were preterm infants (gestational age < 37 weeks). Most participants (97.8%) received 
a hepatitis B vaccination before study enrolment.  
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 
days following Dose 4 for participants administered mixed dosing schedules of PCV13/V114 (Groups 2, 
3, and 4) compared with participants administered a complete dosing schedule of PCV13(Group 1), (2) 
to compare the proportion of participants with anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration 
≥10 mIU/mL at 30 days following Dose 3 for participants administered a complete primary infant 
series dosing schedule of V114 (Group 5) concomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB™ versus participants 
administered a complete primary infant series dosing schedule of PCV13 (Groups 1 and 2) 
concomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB™, (3) to compare the anti-rotavirus Immunoglobulin A (IgA) GMT 
at 30 days following Dose 3 for participants administered a complete primary infant series dosing 
schedule of V114 (Group 5) concomitantly with RotaTeq™ versus participants administered a complete 
primary infant series dosing schedule of PCV13 (Groups 1 and 2) concomitantly with RotaTeq™, (4) to 
evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs and the serotype-specific IgG response rates (proportion of 
participants meeting serotype-specific IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 μg/mL) at 30 days following Dose 3 
separately for each vaccination group (Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and (5) to evaluate the serotype-
specific IgG GMCs at 30 days following Dose 4 for participants administered a complete dosing 
schedule of V114 (Group 5) compared with participants administered a complete dosing schedule of 
PCV13 (Group 1). 
Results:  
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days PD4 for the 13 shared serotypes were generally comparable for 
participants administered mixed regimens and for participants administered a complete dosing regimen 
of PCV13, see Table 37.

Responses to RECOMBIVAX HB™ administered concomitantly with V114 met noninferiority criteria as 
assessed by the proportions of participants with anti-HBsAg concentration ≥10 mIU/mL at 30 days 
PD3. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of participants with anti-
HBsAg concentration ≥10 mIU/mL [Group 5 minus (Group 1 + Group 2)] was greater than -10 
percentage points. Responses to RotaTeq™ administered concomitantly with V114 met noninferiority 
criteria as assessed by anti-rotavirus IgA GMTs at 30 days PD3. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
CI of the anti-rotavirus IgA GMT ratio [Group 5/(Group 1 + Group 2)] was greater than 0.50. 
Serotype-specific immune responses at 30 days post primary series (post dose 3) for the 13 shared 
serotypes were generally comparable across intervention groups as assessed by the proportions of 
participants meeting the IgG threshold value of ≥0.35 µg/mL (response rates) and IgG GMCs. 
Serotype-specific immune responses for serotype 22F were higher after 1 dose of V114 in the infant 
series (Group 3); similar responses were observed in Groups 4 and 5 which received additional V114 
doses in the infant series as assessed by response rates and IgG GMCs. Serotype-specific immune 
responses for serotype 33F were higher after 1 dose of V114 in the infant series (Group 3) and 
increased incrementally with additional V114 primary series doses administered (Groups 4 and 5) as 
assessed by response rates and IgG GMCs.

CHMP’s comment 
Study V114-027 investigated the interchangeability of both PCV13 and V114 in infants aged 
approximately 2 months of age. The study treatment consisted of 4 doses, 3 primary series and 1 
toddler dose. In total 5 groups were investigated with group 1 receiving PCV13 for all doses and group 
5 V114 for all doses. The remaining groups received progressively less PCV13 doses. The different 
switch schedules were investigated in an appreciable number of children (179-181/group). 
At 30 days PTD, the GMC ratio of the mixed groups vs PCV13 (Group 4,3,2/1) varied between 0.77 and 
1.51 for the 13 shared serotypes in all groups. This indicates that the mixed dosing regimen generated 
an immune response that is comparable to the 4-dose PCV13 regimen. Interestingly, in group 5 
receiving only V114 the IgG GMC at 30 days PTD for serotype 3 is lower compared to 30 days PPS, 
which is also observed in study V114-029. 
During the primary series, groups 1 and 2 only received PCV13, group 5 only V114, while groups 3 and 
4 received both PCV13 and V114. At 30 days post primary series, the vast majority of participants 
achieved the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL. The response rate was largely comparable between the groups, 
except for serotype 3 and the 2 unique serotypes. The response rate to serotypes 3 and 33F increased 
progressively with additional V114 primary doses administered. In addition, for serotype 33F IgG GMCs

seem to increase substantially in groups 3, 4 and 5 from 30 days PPS to 30 days PTD and are similar in 
these three groups, indicating that at least one primary dose of V114 and the respective booster dose 
of V114 are required for a protective effect for serotype 33F. For serotype 22F, 1 dose of V114 was 
enough to increase the response rate from 1.4%-2.9% in groups 1 and 2 to 93.8% in group 3. After a 
second or third vaccination, the response rate did not increase substantially. 
These results indicate that switching between the vaccines is possible and does not substantially 
impact the immune response for the 13 shared serotypes. The majority of subjects acquired antibody 
levels above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL in all arms at both 30 days PPS and PTD for the 13 shared 
serotypes. A clinical benefit concerning serotypes 3, 22F and 33F was not established for all scenarios. 
Respective wording in the SmPC is required. 
Study V114-008 
Study Design: Study V114-008 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 different lots of V114 in healthy infants. PCV13 served as 
the active control.  
Treatment: Participants in Study V114-008 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 4 doses of 
either 1 of 2 lots of V114 or PCV13 IM. PCV was administered at 2, 4, 6 and 12 to 15 months of age. 
Study Participants: The study population will consist of healthy male or female infants approximately 
2 months of age (42 to 90 days, inclusive) without a history of invasive pneumococcal disease or prior 
administration of any pneumococcal vaccine. In total 1051 subjects were enrolled. 
In the Lot 1 V114 group, 351 participants were randomized, 350 (99.7%) received at least 1 
vaccination, 308 (87.7%) completed the study, and 43 (12.3%) discontinued the study. In the Lot 2 
V114 group, 350 participants were randomized, 347 (99.1%) received at least 1 vaccination, 305 
(87.1%) completed the study, and 45 (12.9%) discontinued the study. In the PCV13 group, 350 
participants were randomized, 347 (99.1%) received at least 1 vaccination, 308 (88.0%) completed 
the study, and 42 (12.0%) discontinued the study. 
Demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were presented descriptively. 
Demographic characteristics were generally comparable for vaccinated participants across intervention 
groups. No inferential statistics were planned. Overall, the median age was 9.0 weeks (range: 6 to 
12 weeks), 528 (50.2%) were male, the majority was white (83.3%) and of non-Hispanic or Latino 
(86.3%) ethnicity. 
Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to demonstrate that V114 (either V114 Lot 1 or 
V114 Lot 2) is noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes, based on response rate (the 
proportion of subjects meeting serotype-specific IgG reference level of ≥0.35 µg/mL) at 1 month PPS, 
(2) to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs of V114 Lot 1, V114 Lot 2, and PCV13, and the IgG 
GMC ratios between each of the 2 V114 lots and PCV13 for all 15 serotypes included in V114 at 1 
month PPS and (2) to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG GMCs of V114 Lot 1, V114 Lot 2, and PCV13, 
and the IgG GMC ratios between each for the 2 V114 lots and PCV13 for all 15 serotypes included in 
V114 at predose 4 and 1 month PTD. 
Results:  
Both V114 Lot 1 and V114 Lot 2 were noninferior to PCV13 for each of the 13 shared serotypes as 
assessed by IgG response rates (proportion of participants meeting serotype-specific IgG ≥0.35 
µg/mL) at 1 month PPS. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the between-treatment difference 
in the proportion of participants meeting serotype-specific IgG ≥0.35 µg/mL at 1 month PPS was 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

greater than -15 percentage points for all 13 shared serotypes. IgG response rates at 1 month PD3 
were generally comparable between both V114 Lot 1 and V114 Lot 2 and PCV13. 
IgG GMCs and GMC ratios at 1 month PPS were generally comparable, with the exception of a few 
serotypes, between both V114 Lot 1 and V114 Lot 2 and PCV13. Reverse cumulative distribution 
curves show that IgG concentrations at 1 month PPS were generally comparable for the 13 shared 
serotypes across the 3 vaccination groups, and IgG concentrations were higher in the V114 groups 
compared with the PCV13 group for the 2 serotypes unique to V114. 
For the 13 shared serotypes, IgG GMCs at predose 4 and 1 month PTD varied by serotype but were 
generally comparable across the V114 Lot 1, V114 Lot 2, and PCV13 groups. 
CHMP’s comment 
Considering that consistency between lots was in fact not tested, this is regarded as a Phase 2 study. 
Lot-to-lot consistency studies are not routinely required based on the guideline on clinical evaluation of 
vaccines. The additional data on the immune response in healthy children aged approximately 2 
months is appreciated. 
The 2 lots of V114 elicited a consistent response in the participants as measured by IgG GMCs at 30 
days PPS and PTD, indicating that the response to V114 is robust.  
Both V114 and PCV13 are able to elicit an immune response in healthy infants. For both interventions, 
the vast majority of participants achieved the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL both PPS and PTD. At 30 days 
PPS, the GMC ratio for lot 1 and 2 are comparable and range from 0.54 to 1.98 for the 13 shared 
serotypes for Lot 1 and 0.57 to 1.93 for Lot 2. At 30 days PTD, the IgG GMC ratio is narrower, and 
ranges from 0.67 to 1.44 for Lot 1 and from 0.71 to 1.48 for Lot 2. The IgG GMCs for the 2 unique 
serotypes are higher in the V114 groups compared to the PCV13 group at both timepoints, as 
expected.  
These results are in line with the results of the pivotal studies. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Vaxneuvance (V114). The indication applied for is 
“active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 
33F in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 weeks through 17 years of age (prior to 18th 
birthday)”. 
Currently two vaccines are licensed for this indication in children in the EU: Prevenar13 (PCV13) and 
Synflorix (only for children up to 5 years of age). V114 is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugated 
vaccine (PCV) containing the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) 
included in the licensed vaccine PCV13, plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F), not included in 
either PCV13 or Synflorix.  
This submission is based on the inference of V114 effectiveness for the prevention of vaccine serotype-
specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration of noninferior immune responses to the 13 shared 
serotypes in PCV13. The immunobridging approach is in accordance with EMA guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 102/150 
 
 
 
  
 
 
A surrogate of protection, IgG of 0.35 µg/mL, has been established for invasive pneumococcal disease 
(IPD) in children, which can be used to infer protection against IPD. However, it needs to be taken into 
consideration that for pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM) no correlate or surrogate of protection 
exists. PCV13 has been shown to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated 
children has been observed. However, no exact vaccine efficacy estimate was determined, nor the 
immune response required to achieve protection. Therefore, the strategy of non-inferiority testing for 
V114 to PCV13 introduces the possibility of biocreep for the shared serotypes, considering that the 
immune response required to induce a protective effect is unknown. CHMP recommended during 
scientific advice that the Company should conduct post-marketing studies to evaluate vaccine 
effectiveness against AOM and pneumonia (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/2010/PED/III).  An AOM vaccine-
efficacy clinical trial is currently ongoing, which will evaluate the efficacy of V114 in preventing 
vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal AOM. In addition, PSURs, including information on breakthrough 
disease/vaccine failure, serotype distribution and incidence of IPD will provide an indication on efficacy 
against the new serotypes included in the vaccine, as frequency of IPD caused by these serotypes is 
expected to decline after V114 uptake. In addition this might also provide insight into impact of the 
lower titres on immune persistence as frequency of IPD is reported per age category.   
The submission consists of a total of 7 phase 3 studies (V114-023, V114-024, V114-025, V114-027, 
V114-029, V114-030, and V114-031) and 1 phase 2 study (V114-008). Studies V114-025 (3-dose 
regimen) and V114-029 (4-dose regimen) are considered pivotal as they provide the main evidence for 
immunogenicity and safety in the target population.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
All 8 clinical studies included in the application were randomized, double-blind, active comparator 
PCV13-controlled, multicentre studies. This study design is adequate. In all studies, the vaccination 
regimen, was identical to the posology for PCV13 and the posology in the updated SmPC of V114. In 
addition, V114 and PCV13 were administered concomitantly with vaccines administered in the frame of 
routine child vaccination programs as offered in some European countries during several studies, which 
is appreciated. This is in line with the scientific advice given. The studies were conducted globally, 
allowing evaluation of the results in different populations. 
The serological assays used to determine immunogenicity were validated and shown to be fit for 
purpose. In addition, the PnECL assay was bridged to the WHO ELISA, confirming a link between the 
immune responses generated by V114 vaccination and the clinical demonstration of protective efficacy 
against IPD conferred by the 7 conjugated polysaccharides in Prevnar.  
In both pivotal studies the population enrolled consisted of healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, which 
adequately reflects the target population for vaccination with V114. 
Based on the study objectives for both pivotal studies, the immune response induced by V114 can be 
adequately compared to the immune response induced by PCV13, as proportion of participants 
achieving titer of 0.35µg/mL, IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs will be determined at different time points and 
compared between the 2 groups.  
Primary analyses to conclude on non-inferiority were performed on the PP population, with supportive 
analyses based on the FAS. The analysis sets and the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary 
endpoints are generally considered adequate. However, the analyses were not stratified by 
centre/region.  The applicant justified the choice to refrain from stratifying by centre, taking into 
account the sample size, the fact that geographical differences in immune responses following infant 
vaccination with PCVs vary with serotype, the objectivity of immunogenicity endpoints and the 
standardization of safety assessment across study sites. Although the argumentation cannot be fully 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 103/150 
 
 
 
  
 
understood, post-hoc sensitivity analyses adjusted for region (Europe versus ex-Europe) indicated that 
region had limited impact on immunogenicity results.  Multiplicity was adequately controlled for the 
primary objectives but was not strictly controlled for the secondary objectives. 
Immunogenicity data 
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in all studies and subgroups tested. Generally, the immune 
response to V114 was numerically lower compared to PCV13 as assessed by IgG GMCs for the 13 
shared serotypes and higher for the 2 unique serotypes. When comparing IgG GMCs generated by 
V114 to PCV13, the GMC ratio fell below 1 for the majority of the shared serotypes. However, the 
response rate, defined as the proportion of participants achieving ≥0.35 µg/mL, was largely 
comparable and indicated that the majority of participants in both treatment groups achieved the 
threshold of 0.35 µg/mL. A consistent immune response was observed across studies, with the lowest 
response rate being observed for serotype 6B and the highest for serotype 19F for the shared 
serotypes. The response rates in these serotypes were comparable between the V114 and PCV13 
group. A higher response rate was observed for the 2 unique serotypes in the V114 group compared to 
the PCV13 group, as expected. The response to serotype 6A was consistently lower in the V114 group 
compared to the PCV13 group, leading to not meeting non-inferiority criteria in both the pivotal studies 
at 30 days post primary series (PPS).   
Study V114-029 formally failed to achieve one of the predefined primary endpoints (non-inferiority of 
IgG GMCs at 30 days PPS for all shared serotypes), therefore the study was considered failed and no 
further statistical testing of secondary endpoints is justified. Secondary endpoints should be 
descriptive. Considering the fact that the percentage of participants achieving the IgG threshold value 
of ≥0.35 µg/mL was 93.7% in the V114 compared to 98.6% in the PCV13 group at 30 days PPS and 
no difference between the groups could be observed at 30 days PTD in response rate, the clinical 
impact of the reduced response is likely limited.  
In all studies, the antibody concentration decreased over time as IgG GMCs immediately prior to the 
toddler dose were lower compared to 30 days PPS in both treatment arms. The toddler dose increased 
IgG GMCs to levels comparable to or higher than PPS. This indicates that immune memory is induced. 
When looking at the reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) of the 13 shared serotypes, all 
serotypes showed a similar pattern for the V114 group and the PCV13 group, although the curves for 
V114 generally fell below the curve for PCV13. Visually, the curves are comparable, indicating that the 
groups respond comparably. The data indicate that IgG concentrations decline at a similar rate after 
vaccination with V114 and PCV13 and consequently also the response rates. Given that the initial 
concentrations were lower with V114, it could be assumed that the protective effect of V114 might 
wane earlier compared to PCV13. Since no data after a longer period are available, this issue can 
currently not be answered. PSURs, including information on breakthrough disease/vaccine failure, 
serotype distribution and incidence of IPD will provide an indication on impact of the lower titres on 
immune persistence as frequency of IPD is reported per age category.   
The results of the functional OPA antibodies were consistent with the results as observed for IgG 
GMCs, with the OPA GMTs being generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups though slightly 
lower in the V114 group. Interestingly, no difference in serotype 3 OPA antibodies was seen between 
V114 and PCV13 30 days post toddler dose (PTD).  
It has been noted that the number of subjects using paracetamol concomitantly is much higher in both 
pivotal studies compared to the other studies (025: ~48%, 029: ~67%, 024: ~25-35%, 027: ~6%, 
008: no use of paracetamol). Although the use of paracetamol was overall balanced between groups in 
all respective studies, further discussion was requested based on post marketing findings with PCV13, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 104/150 
 
 
 
  
 
which indicated that the prophylactic use of antipyretics (ibuprofen and paracetamol) reduced the 
immune response especially after the primary series. The potential influence of prophylactic use of 
antipyretics (ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response, as observed in the post-marketing 
of PCV13, cannot be ruled out given the current data. The presented results of subgroup analyses 
based on concomitant antipyretic use (yes/no) are similar for both vaccines, indicating a similar effect 
for both vaccines. Consequently, respective wording in the SmPC is required. 
A lower immune response is seen in study V114-025, leading to slightly lower response rates, 
indicating that the immune reaction induced by the 2-dose primary series is reduced compared to the 
3-dose primary series. However, at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, GMC ratios were comparable across 
the 4 studies, indicating that while V114 generated the lowest immune response in study V114-025, 
the same holds true for PCV13. It is in the remit of the NITAGs to determine the benefit/risk balance of 
the 2- vs 3-dose primary series, taking into consideration the burden of disease in the respective 
country and the fact that no increase in occurrence of AEs after subsequent dosing could be observed 
using the different regimens.  
Subgroup analyses 
Slight  differences  in  immune  response  could  be  observed  between  the  subgroups  in  sex,  race  and 
ethnicity;  however,  no  clear  trends  were  observed.  The  differences  observed  between  subgroups  are 
small and considered not to impact the use of V114 in these subpopulations. 
Concomitant administration of routine childhood vaccines 
The immune response to the concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable between the V114 
and PCV13 group, indicating that the generation of the immune response to the concomitantly 
administered vaccines was not impacted differently by the 2 treatment arms. All responses for the 
concomitant vaccines showed a within 5 percentage points difference between the treatment arms. 
Interchangeability 
Study V114-027 investigated the interchangeability of both PCV13 and V114 in infants aged 
approximately 2 months of age. The study treatment consisted of 4 doses, 3 primary series and 1 
toddler dose; group 1 received PCV13 for all doses and group 5 V114 for all doses. The remaining 
groups received progressively less PCV13 doses. The different switch schedules were investigated in an 
appreciable number of children (179-181/group). 
Overall, the results of the study suggest that switching between the vaccines is possible and does not 
substantially impact the immune response. The majority of subjects acquired antibody levels above the 
threshold of 0.35 µg/mL in all arms at both 30 days PPS and PTD for the 13 shared serotypes. The 
response rates were largely comparable between the groups, except for serotype 3 and the 2 unique 
serotypes. The response rate to serotypes 3 and 33F increased progressively with additional V114 
primary doses administered. In addition, for serotype 33F IgG GMCs seem to increase substantially in 
groups 3, 4 and 5 from 30 days PPS to 30 days PTD and are similar in these three groups, indicating 
that at least one primary dose of V114 and the respective booster dose of V114 are required for a 
protective effect for serotype 33F. For serotype 22F, 1 dose of V114 was enough to increase the 
response rate from 1.4%-2.9% in groups 1 and 2 to 93.8% in group 3 and no further substantial 
increase was seen after additional doses. At 30 days PTD, the GMC ratio of the mixed groups vs PCV13 
(Group 4,3,2/1) varied between 0.77 and 1.51 for the 13 shared serotypes in all groups. This indicates 
that the mixed dosing regimen generated an immune response that is comparable to the 4-dose 
PCV13 regimen. A clinical benefit concerning serotypes 3, 22F and 33F was not established for all 
scenarios. Consequently, respective wording should be included in the SmPC.

Catch-up vaccination 
Study V114-024 investigated the immunogenicity of catch-up vaccination with V114 in children aged 7 
to 11 months, 12 to 23 months and 2 to 17 years of age. The different catch-up schedules were 
documented in an appreciable number of children (n=303; 62-177/group). The three catch-up 
vaccination schedules evaluated were identical to the schedules currently proposed in the SmPC and 
are similar to the recommended schedules for PCV13 in the 3 age groups, with 3 doses for children 
aged 7 to 11 months, 2 doses for children 12 to 23 months of age and 1 dose for children 2 to 17 
years of age.  
Overall, the data suggest that the catch-up schedules induce an immune response that is substantial 
and sufficient to ensure protection against IPD, as the proportion of subjects achieving IgG antibody 
level ≥0.35 μg/ml after vaccination with V114 was high (83.9% to 100%) for all serotypes and for all 3 
age groups. This was comparable to the response rate seen in the PCV13 groups, which ranged from 
87.7% to 100% for all serotypes included in the vaccine. Again, the IgG GMCs were slightly lower in 
the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group for the majority of the shared serotypes for all 3 age 
groups. However, in both the V114 and PCV13 groups the IgG GMCs were well above the threshold 
level of 0.35 μg/ml for all 15 serotypes included in V114 and the 13 serotypes in PCV13. 
A potential benefit of an additional vaccination with Vaxneuvance in children previously fully vaccinated 
with PCV7 or PCV10 is difficult to assess, as participants with varying PCV vaccination history (PCV7, 
PCV10 or PCV13) and vaccination status (partially or fully vaccinated) were pooled. The applied binary 
stratification based on the history of prior PCV vaccination, would theoretically allow more fully 
vaccinated participants or more participants who previously received higher-valent PCV in the 
Vaxneuvance arm thereby skewing the results. Unfortunately, respective data was not collected. 
Immunogenicity in special populations 
Pre-term 
Considering the fact that preterm infants are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, the 
immunogenicity of this population was evaluated separately to ensure adequate protection. 
Data from pre-term infants was integrated across 4 Phase 3 clinical studies: V114-025, V114-029, 
V114-027 and V114-031, as the design of the studies was similar. Treatment consisted of 4 doses of 
PCV, with the primary series consisting of 3 single doses followed by a toddler dose. However, during 
study V114-025 PCV was administered at ~2, 3, 4, 11 to 15 months of age, while for all other studies 
administration of PCV was performed at ~2, 4, 6, 12 to 15 months of age.  
Both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, the vast majority of participants achieved the threshold value of 
0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes in both treatment arms. Comparable to the total population, the IgG 
GMCs generated by administration of V114 were consistently lower for 12 of the 13 shared serotypes 
(except serotype 3) compared to the IgG GMCs generated by PCV13. The immune response generated 
for the 2 additional serotypes was higher in the V114 group. The RCDC curves showed a similar 
pattern between the 2 treatment arms. 
The results of the OPA GMTs were comparable to the IgG GMCs and showed that V114 was 
immunogenic. The OPA GMTs generated by V114 were slightly lower compared to PCV13 for the 
shared serotypes, while they were higher in the V114 group for the 2 additional serotypes.  
Of note, for both vaccines the response rates and IgG GMCs were generally higher in pre term infants 
compared to full term infants. Due to the low numbers of preterm infants included in the separate 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 106/150 
 
 
 
  
 
studies, this is not expected to substantially impact the immune response observed for the total 
population. 
Immunocompromised 
Study V114-023 was a descriptive study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 
single dose of V114 in children 5 to 17 years of age with sickle cell disease. In total 104 participants 
were enrolled. Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in children with sickle cell disease. The 
immune responses generated by a single dose of V114 and PCV13 were generally comparable. The IgG 
GMCs generated were well above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL, indicating that the response generated 
was substantial and clinically relevant. The response as measured by OPA GMTs was generally 
comparable to the response as measured by IgG GMCs.  
Study V114-030 was an active-comparator controlled, double blind study in HIV-1 infected children. 
Patients either received V114 or PCV13 followed 8 weeks later by PPV23. The vast majority of 
participants included in the study received antiretroviral therapy and had a CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 
cells/μL. This indicates that the participants still had a functioning immune system.  
Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic. The immune responses induced by V114 and PCV13 were 
generally comparable and at 30 days after vaccination the IgG GMCs achieved for all serotypes were 
above the threshold value of 0.35 µg/mL in both treatment arms. The results for OPA GMTs were 
comparable to the results achieved for IgG GMCs. The response in the subgroup with CD4+ T-cell 
counts ≥200 to <500 cells/μL was overall slightly lower compared to the total population. Following 
vaccination with PPV23 IgG GMCs at Week 12 were generally comparable with those observed at 30 
days postvaccination with either V114 or PCV13. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, V114 was observed to be immunogenic in all studies and subgroups tested and induced an 
immune response to all 15 serotypes included in the vaccine. Generally, the immune response to V114 
was lower compared to PCV13 as assessed by IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotypes, and higher for 
the 2 unique serotypes. However, the response rate, defined as the proportion of participants 
achieving ≥0.35 µg/mL, was largely comparable and indicated that the majority of participants in both 
groups achieved the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL. Therefore, no concern is raised for the immediate 
protective effect, but an earlier waning of the achieved protective effect might be possible. 
Of note, the surrogate of protection of 0.35 µg/mL only applies to IPD and no surrogate or correlate of 
protection exist for pneumonia or AOM. As recommended in Scientific Advice, the Company should 
conduct post-marketing studies to evaluate vaccine effectiveness against AOM and pneumonia. The 
post-marketing program should also include population-based surveillance of the incidence rates of IPD 
in several different countries for an appreciable number of years using national surveillance systems, 
in particular for the new serotypes for which efficacy against IPD is not known, including analysis of 
break-through cases over time after vaccination to determine waning of the protective effect over 
time.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The discussion of clinical safety is based on available safety data from 8 clinical studies: 1 Phase 2 
study (V114-008) and 7 Phase 3 studies (V114-025, -029, -023, -024, -027, -030 and -031).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 107/150 
 
 
 
  
 
The 8 studies contributing to the evaluation of safety enrolled a diverse population of over 8300 
children across 26 countries. A total of 5366 infants (including 221 preterm infants [<37 weeks 
gestational age at birth]) and children received at least 1 dose of V114 in these studies, allowing for an 
evaluation of safety in the paediatric population. 
Safety evaluation methods 
The duration of AE collection, requirements for AE reporting, and methods used for safety evaluation 
were consistent across all studies in the V114 paediatric program. 
All participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after administration of study intervention for any 
immediate reactions. Postvaccination safety evaluations were reported on an electronic vaccine report 
card (VRC). The following information was reported daily by the participant or the participant’s legally 
acceptable representative on the VRC: 
•  Day 1 through Day 7 postvaccination: body temperature (and Day 8 through Day 14 
postvaccination if fever was suspected). 
•  Day 1 through Day 14 postvaccination: 
-  Solicited injection-site complaints: redness (erythema), swelling, tenderness (pain), and 
hard lump (induration) 
-  Solicited systemic complaints (using age-appropriate terms for infants and children of 
different ages): 
o  For participants <3 years of age: irritability, drowsiness (somnolence), appetite 
lost (decreased appetite), and hives or welts (urticaria) 
o  For participants ≥3 years of age: muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), 
headache, tiredness (fatigue), and hives or welts (urticaria) 
-  Other unsolicited injection-site or systemic complaints 
-  Use/receipt of concomitant medications and vaccinations 
• 
Intensity or size of the complaints: injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, and 
injection-site swelling were graded by size; all other complaints were graded by intensity. 
For complaints reported on the VRC, the investigator reviewed the data with the participant or 
participant’s legally acceptable representative and reported events meeting the protocol-specified AE 
definition in the clinical database. Investigators also assessed the causal relationship to the study 
vaccine, intensity, and seriousness of each identified AE using the protocol-specified criteria. 
In all 8 studies, all AEs were collected from the day of each vaccination through 14 days 
postvaccination.  
In the 7 Phase 3 studies, SAEs were collected through 6 months after the last dose of V114 or PCV13. 
In the Phase 2 study, V114-008, SAEs were collected through 30 days after the last dose of V114 or 
PCV13.  
In studies with more than 1 vaccination timepoint (V114-008, V114-024, V114-025, V114-027, V114-
029, V114-030, and V114-031), discontinuation from study intervention due to AEs was evaluated. 
Safety evaluation populations 
Safety analyses were performed in the APaT population, defined as all randomized participants who 
received at least 1 dose of study intervention. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 108/150 
 
 
 
  
 
To evaluate the safety of V114 when administered as a complete 3- or 4-dose regimen, safety data 
from the 4 Phase 3 studies (V114-025, V114-027 [Groups 1 and 5 only], V114-029, and V114-031) 
were integrated based on similarities in study design, population, and dosing strategy (either V114 or 
PCV13 administered as a 2-dose or 3-dose primary series during the first 4 to 6 months of life followed 
by a toddler dose at 11 to 15 months of age). Participants who received both V114 and PCV13 either 
inadvertently or based on study design (including the mixed 4-dose regimens in V114-027 Groups 2, 
3, and 4) were not included in the integrated analysis. Results are shown for all infants (regardless of 
gestational age) and separately for the subset of preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age at birth) 
who were enrolled in these studies.  
CHMP’s comment 
In general methods to assess the reactogenicity and safety of V114 are appropriate. Reactogenicity 
was followed for 14 days when concerning solicited injection-site and systemic reactions and for 7 days 
concerning body temperature, which is considered appropriate (see Guideline on clinical evaluation of 
vaccines). Subjects were followed for 6 months, which is considered a sufficient period of time to 
collect relevant adverse events. Only in the Phase 2 Study V114-008, SAEs were collected through 30 
days post-vaccination, which is considered short. 
The safety section as described below is focussed mainly on the integrated safety population of 
participants aged approximately 2 months included in Study V114-025, V114-027 (groups 1 and 5 
only), V114-029 and V114-031. Where relevant, additional information from the other studies is 
included.  
All participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after administration of study intervention for any 
immediate reactions. The MAH was asked to present a table including immediate reactions for pooled 
study data as well as for individual studies. The information was provided and did not give rise to any 
new safety concerns. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 5366 participants received ≥1 dose of V114 and 3491 participants received ≥1 dose of PCV13 
in the 8 studies submitted, see Table 39.

Participants were counted once for each column according to the intervention they actually received. 
a One participant in Study V114-025, 1 participant in Study V114-029 and 5 participants in Study V114-031 inadvertently 
received both V114 and PCV13 and were included in both intervention groups. 
b A total number of 498 participants in Study V114-027 in groups 2, 3, and 4 received both V114 and PCV13 per study design 
and were included in both intervention groups. 
Study V114-023 enrolled participants with sickle cell disease; Study V114-030 enrolled participants with HIV. HIV=Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus; PCV=Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (V114 or PCV13). 
Demographic characteristics in the integrated population were generally comparable in both 
intervention groups. The median age was 9.0 weeks (range: 6 to 12 weeks). Approximately equal 
proportions of male and female participants were enrolled. The population was diverse with regard to

race, approximately 17% of participants were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and approximately 31% 
of participants were from Europe. A total of 6.3% of participants were preterm infants (<37 weeks 
gestational age at birth). 
CHMP’s comment  
In total 5366 participants were exposed to V114. The size of the safety database is considered 
sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of V114. In addition, the composition of the safety 
database also appears to be acceptable as it is considered sufficiently representative of the target 
population (healthy infants approximately 2 months of age). 
Adverse events 
Integrated population 
The proportions of participants with AEs, including injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, vaccine-related 
AEs, and SAEs, after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, and after any dose, see 
Table 40, were generally comparable in both intervention groups.

CHMP’s comment 
In both intervention groups, the vast majority of participants experienced at least 1 AE, with the 
majority also experiencing a vaccine-related AE.  
The percentage of participants experiencing vaccine-related SAEs was low in both treatment groups, 
<1%.  
Common AEs 
The most commonly reported AEs with an incidence of ≥1% in either treatment group are presented in 
Table 41. The proportions of participants with specific AEs by SOC and PT after any dose were 
generally comparable in both intervention groups.

a Estimated differences and CIs are calculated based on the Miettinen & Nurminen method. Every participant is 
counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the 
columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title. 
Reported adverse events include nonserious adverse events that occurred within 14 days of any dose and serious 
adverse events that occurred after dose 1 through completion of study participation. 
b Injection site erythema, injection site induration, injection site pain, injection site swelling, decreased appetite, 
irritability, somnolence, and urticaria were solicited from Day 1 through Day 14 following each dose. 
For V114-027, only participants who were randomized to the complete dosing schedule of Prevnar 13™ (Group 1) or 
V114 (Group 5) are included. 
Adverse event terms are reported using MedDRA version 24.0.

The most frequently reported (≥5%) AEs after each dose of V114 were the solicited AEs of irritability, 
somnolence, injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, decreased appetite, injection-site swelling, 
and injection-site induration and the unsolicited AE of pyrexia. 
A rainfall plot of AEs after any dose with an incidence of ≥5% in either treatment groups is presented 
in Figure 21.

Irritability

Urticaria 
Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event, and is 
classified according to the highest non-missing intensity grading. 
Injection site pain, decreased appetite, irritability, somnolence, and urticaria were solicited 
from Day 1 through Day 14 following each dose. Injection site erythema, injection site 
induration, and injection site swelling solicited from Day 1 through Day 14 following any dose 
are not included in this table as these events were graded by size and are displayed in a 
separate summary. 
For V114-027, only participants who were randomized to the complete dosing schedule of 
Prevnar 13™ (Group 1) or V114 (Group 5) are included. 
Adverse event terms are reported using MedDRA version 24.0. 
The proportions of participants with injection-site erythema, induration, or swelling by maximum size 
after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, and after any dose were generally 
comparable in both intervention groups. 
Of the participants with solicited injection-site erythema, induration, or swelling following each dose, 
most had events with a maximum size ≤2 inches (5.1 cm) and the proportions of participants with a 
maximum size >3 inches (7.6 cm) were low (<1%). 
Of the participants with solicited AEs, the majority had events of short duration (≤3 days).

CHMP’s comment 
The majority of participants in both treatment groups experienced at least 1 AE. The distribution of AEs 
was generally comparable between the 2 groups, as the percentage of participants experiencing the 
different AEs did not differ more than 10%. 
The most frequently reported AEs, reported in >20% of participants, were, next to the unsolicited AE 
of pyrexia, the solicited AEs: injection site AEs (injection site pain, -erythema, -induration and -
swelling) and systemic AEs (irritability, somnolence and decreased appetite). Of note, the solicited 
systemic AE of urticaria only occurred in 5.7% of participants in the V114 group.  
The rainfall plot of the most frequently reported AEs after each dose of V114 showed that the V114 
was slightly more reactogenic compared to PCV13, as the majority of AEs occurred slightly more 
frequently after injection with V114 compared to PCV13. 
The majority of AEs experienced were mild to moderate in intensity in both treatment groups.  
Overall, the safety profile is comparable between V114 and PCV13. 
Vaccine-related AEs 
The proportions of participants with injection-site AEs (solicited and unsolicited) and vaccine-related 
systemic AEs (solicited and unsolicited) after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, 
and after any dose were generally comparable in both intervention groups. 
Nearly all injection-site AEs in both intervention groups were considered by the investigator to be 
vaccine related. The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related injection-site AEs after each dose 
of V114 were the solicited injection-site AEs (injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, injection-site 
swelling, and injection-site induration). Injection-site urticaria and injection-site bruising occurred 
consistently in >0.1% of participants after each dose of V114. 
The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related systemic AEs after each dose of V114 were the 
solicited systemic AEs (irritability, somnolence, and decreased appetite) and the unsolicited AE of 
pyrexia.

Body temperature increased 
The proportions of participants with maximum body temperature measurements based on the Brighton 
Collaboration cut points were generally comparable in both intervention groups. 
Of the participants with a maximum body temperature ≥38.0˚C (100.4˚F), the majority had a 
maximum body temperature <39.0°C (102.2˚F). The proportion of participants in each intervention 
group reporting a maximum body temperature ≥40.0˚C (104.0˚F) was low (<2%) following any dose,

CHMP’s comment 
Overall, the majority of participants experienced vaccine-related AEs in both intervention groups. The 
proportion of vaccine-related AEs were comparable between the 2 intervention groups for all SOCs and 
PTs. 
The ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC should include all vaccine-related AEs, which is currently not 
the case for infants and children 6 weeks to less than 2 years. The MAH should include, unless 
otherwise justified, the following related AEs in section 4.8 of the SmPC: vomiting, rash (pooling 
different terms when possible), injection-site bruising, insomnia and febrile convulsion.   
Single cases of possibly related AEs do not provide a clear signal and do not need to be included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The proportion of participants with maximum body temperature measurements based on the Brighton 
Collaboration cut points were comparable between intervention groups. In addition, the proportion of 
participants with the maximum body temperature ≥40.0˚C (104.0˚F) was low (<2%) in both 
intervention groups.

Only  including  the  participants  who  were  randomized  to  the  complete  dosing  schedule  of 
In both treatment groups 1 SAE was observed after PCV vaccination and 2 SAEs were observed 
following PPV vaccination. 
V114-008 
The proportions of participants with SAEs occurring within the 30 days following administration of V114 
or PCV13 were low and comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). Overall, bronchiolitis (0.6% 
and 0.3% of participants in the V114 and PCV13 groups, respectively) and gastroenteritis viral (0.4% 
and 0.6% of participants in the V114 and PCV13 groups, respectively) were the most frequently reported 
SAEs.  
Two subjects both in the V114 group reported a vaccine-related SAE in this study, see Table 45. 
•  One participant experienced a vaccine-related SAE of febrile convulsion following vaccination 1. 
On Day 1, the participant received V114 Lot 2 in addition to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, 
acellular pertussis, poliovirus, Hib, and rotavirus vaccines. The investigator considered that all 
the vaccinations received on Day 1 were possibly related to the event of seizure. The 
participant was discontinued from the study and the event resolved without sequelae. 
•  One participant experienced a vaccine-related SAE of purpura following vaccination 4. The 
participant received the fourth dose of V114 Lot 2 on Day 311, and on Day 312 the participant 
experienced purpura involving the ankles, hands, arms, and ears. The investigator considered 
that the event of purpura was related to study vaccine, and potentially related to 
meningococcal C conjugated vaccine, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccine all received on 
Day 311. Purpura resolved on Day 319 without sequelae 
V114-023 
The proportion of participants with SAEs was comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). The 
most frequently reported SAE was sickle cell anaemia with crisis, and no SAEs were considered by the 
investigator to be vaccine-related (Table 45).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 118/150 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
V114-024 
The proportion of participants with SAEs was comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). 
Gastroenteritis was the only SAE reported for >1 participant in a study intervention group (2 
participants, 7 to 11 months of age in the V114 group). No SAE was considered to be related to study 
intervention (Table 45).  
V114-025 
The proportions of participants with SAEs occurring within the 30 days following administration of V114 
or PCV13 were low and comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). Approximately 10% of the 
participants reported an SAE; overall, bronchiolitis (1.5% and 1.7% of participants in the V114 and 
PCV13 groups, respectively) and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis (1.4% and 0.8% of 
participants in the V114 and PCV13 groups, respectively) were the most frequently reported SAEs. No 
participant discontinued due to an SAE. 
One subject in the PCV13 group reported a vaccine-related SAE in this study, see Table 45. 
•  One participant experienced a vaccine-related SAE of pyrexia following vaccination 1. The 
participant was afebrile from Day 3 and pyrexia was considered resolved. The investigator 
considered the event of pyrexia related to the study vaccination.  
V114-027 
The proportions of participants with SAEs were comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). 
Bronchiolitis (26 participants) and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis (11 participants) were the 
most commonly reported SAEs overall.  
One participant (Group 3: PCV13, PCV13, V114 and V114) had an SAE (epilepsy) considered to be 
related to study intervention (following Dose 2, PCV13 and concomitant vaccinations).  
•  On Day 77 (Day 1 Postvaccination 2), the participant 0091-108486 developed focal to 
generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was taken to the hospital and treated with IV diazepam 
and levetiracetam. The seizure stopped after approximately 20 minutes. On Day 124 
(Postvaccination 1, Day 48 Postvaccination 2) the result of the gene mutation blood test 
showed the presence of a likely pathogenic missense sodium voltage-gated channel alpha 
subunit 1 variant, heterogenous c.1277A>G (p.Tyr426Cys), which was consistent with a 
diagnosis of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome). 
V114-029 
The  proportion  of  participants  with  SAEs  was  comparable  across  intervention  groups  (Table  45). 
Respiratory  syncytial  virus  bronchiolitis  (19  [1.1%]  participants),  gastroenteritis  (18  [1.0%] 
participants), and bronchiolitis (17 [1.0%] participants) were the top 3 most frequently reported SAEs 
overall. None of the SAEs were assessed by the investigator to be related to study intervention (Table 
45).  
V114-030 
The proportion of participants with SAEs was comparable across intervention groups (Table 45). None 
of the SAEs were assessed by the investigator to be related to study intervention (Table 45). 
V114-031 
The proportions of participants with SAEs were generally comparable between intervention groups 
(Table 45). Approximately 10% of the participants reported an SAE; bronchiolitis (<2%) and 
pneumonia (<1%) were the most commonly reported SAEs overall. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 119/150 
 
 
 
  
 
Two participants (V114 group) reported SAEs (both were events of pyrexia) that were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study vaccine, had durations of 3 days, and were resolved. Of these, 
one participant reported a maximum body temperature of 100.4°F (38.0°C, event considered mild in 
intensity), with onset on the day of vaccination with Dose 1; concomitant vaccines included RotaTeq 
(rotavirus), Pentaxim (DTaP-IPV-HepB), and HIBERIX (Hib). The other participant reported a 
maximum body temperature of 102.9°F (39.4°C, event considered moderate in intensity), with onset 
on the day of vaccination with Dose 3; concomitant vaccines included DTwP-Hib-HB-and OPV. 
CHMP’s comment 
Overall, the proportions of participants with SAEs were comparable across intervention groups and the 
majority of SAEs were in the SOC Infections and Infestations. Very few SAEs were considered related 
to the vaccine, which is agreed. 
In addition, several observations of the assessment of relatedness to the vaccine were not followed 
with regards to PCV13.  
In study V114-027 it is questioned why the SAE of epilepsy was assessed as related to the vaccine, 
since a gene mutation blood test showed the presence of a likely pathogenic missense sodium voltage-
gated channel alpha subunit 1 variant, heterogenous c.1277A>G (p.Tyr426Cys), which was consistent 
with a diagnosis of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome).  
During study V114-029 participants 0053-246077 and 0164-245152, both in the PCV13 group, 
experienced the SAE of pyrexia on Day 24 and Day 10 respectively after treatment 1. As no cause for 
the fever was determined, the assessment of the investigator that the pyrexia was not related to the 
vaccine is questioned.  
However, considering the fact that it involves PCV13, the issues are not further pursued as it is not 
considered relevant for the current procedure. 
Deaths 
Five participant deaths were reported in the 8 studies. None of the deaths were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study vaccine. 
Three participants who had received V114 had the following AEs resulting in death: congenital heart 
disease (V114-029), craniocerebral injury after a car accident (V114-031), and unknown cause of 
death (V114-008). 
Two participants who had received PCV13 had the following AEs resulting in death: head injury and 
septic shock (V114-029) and cardiorespiratory arrest (sudden unexplained infant death) (V114-031). 
CHMP’s comment 
It can be agreed that the number of deaths in the 8 studies is low and comparable between study 
interventions, as in the V114 group 3 out of 5366 participants (0.06%) died and 2 out of 
3491 participants (0.06%) in the PCV13 group.  
Narratives of participants who died were reviewed and no indication of a causal relationship to the 
vaccine could be identified. There is limited information available on 1 death due to unknown cause 
during study V114-008, therefore causality cannot be formally excluded however is deemed unlikely. 
One 8-week old female participant from the study V114-008 died on Day 19 post-vaccination. An 
autopsy was performed, which concluded that the cause and manner of death remained undetermined, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 120/150 
 
 
 
  
 
although environmental factors were cited. It mentioned that the risk of sudden death increases when 
an infant is placed in an unsafe sleep environment, such as an adult bed. Additional information is not 
available, therefore, no further assessment can be made. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not conducted for the studies included in this submission. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex, Race and Ethnicity 
Safety results observed in the integrated population for both male and female subgroups were 
generally consistent with the overall population (data not shown). 
Safety results observed in the integrated population within the race subgroups analysed (Asian, 
multiple, white) are presented in Table 46. Injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related AEs 
were reported for a lower proportion of Asian participants compared with white and multiple race 
participants in both intervention groups. Higher proportions of participant with SAEs were reported 
among Asian participants in both intervention groups.

Safety results observed in the integrated population for participants of Hispanic and Latino ethnicity 
and for participants not of Hispanic and Latino ethnicity were generally consistent with the overall 
population (data not shown). 
CHMP’s comment 
Overall, the safety profile in the subgroups of sex, race and ethnicity were similar to the safety profile 
in the entire population and no new safety signals are observed.

In the integrated analysis, no clear trends were observed with respect to reactogenicity between males 
and females in the V114 group. Interestingly, in participants with SCD and HIV, reactogenicity appears 
to be slightly higher in females compared to males in the V114 group. However, considering the small 
differences, no impact is expected. 
A trend towards higher reactogenicity in White subjects was observed for both intervention groups 
compared to Asian and multiple race participants. In participants with multiple race, V114 was 
considered more reactogenic compared to PCV13. However, these results do not give rise to concern. 
In the integrated analysis, no clear trends were observed with respect to reactogenicity between the 
ethnic subgroups. 
Upon request the MAH presented the safety results per sex, race and ethnicity for study V114-008. 
The results were generally in line with the safety profile seen in the integrated safety population.

PCV13 per study design and were included in both intervention groups. 
PCV=Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (V114 or PCV13). 
Demographic characteristics in the preterm population were generally comparable in both intervention 
groups. The median age was 8.0 weeks (range: 6 to 12 weeks) in the V114 group compared to 9.0 
weeks in the PCV13 group (range: 6 to 12 weeks. The proportion of male participants was higher in 
the both treatment groups compared to females. The population was diverse with regard to race, with 
the majority being white and not Hispanic or Latino for the majority of participants. Approximately 
34% of participants were from Europe.  
Adverse events 
The proportions of participants with AEs, including injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, vaccine-related 
AEs, and SAEs, after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, and after any dose, see 
Table 48, were generally comparable in both intervention groups.

a Estimated differences and CIs are calculated based on the Miettinen & Nurminen method. Every participant is 
counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the 
columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title. 
Reported adverse events include nonserious adverse events that occurred within 14 days of any dose and serious 
adverse events that occurred after dose 1 through completion of study participation. 
b Injection site erythema, injection site induration, injection site pain, injection site swelling, decreased appetite, 
irritability, somnolence, and urticaria were solicited from Day 1 through Day 14 following each dose. 
For V114-027, only participants who were randomized to the complete dosing schedule of Prevnar 13™ (Group 1) 
or V114 (Group 5) are included. 
Adverse event terms are reported using MedDRA version 24.0.  
CI=confidence interval; RSV= respiratory syncytial virus 
A rainfall plot of AEs after any dose with an incidence of ≥5% in either treatment groups is presented 
in Figure 22. 
Figure 22 Rainfall Plot of Adverse Events occurring ≥5% in either treatment group following 
any dose – Preterm Infants (V114-025, V114-027, V114-029, V114-031) 
(Source: Figure 5.3.5.3.3-pedspneumo: 10) 
The proportions of participants with AEs (solicited and unsolicited) by maximum intensity were 
generally comparable in both intervention groups after each dose. Of the participants with AEs graded 
by intensity, the majority experienced AEs with a maximum intensity of mild to moderate in both 
intervention groups.  
The proportions of preterm infants with injection-site erythema, induration, or swelling by maximum 
size after each dose were generally comparable in both intervention groups. Of the participants with 
solicited AEs, the majority had events of short duration (≤3 days).

Vaccine-related AEs 
The proportions of participants with injection-site AEs (solicited and unsolicited) and vaccine-related 
systemic AEs (solicited and unsolicited) after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, 
and after any dose were generally comparable in both intervention groups. 
Nearly all injection-site AEs in both intervention groups were considered by the investigator to be 
vaccine related. The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related injection-site AEs after any dose 
of V114 were the solicited injection-site AEs (injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, injection-site 
swelling, and injection-site induration).  
The most frequently reported (≥1%) vaccine-related systemic AEs after each dose of V114 in preterm 
infants were the solicited systemic AEs (irritability, somnolence, and decreased appetite) and the 
unsolicited AEs of pyrexia, diarrhoea (following Dose 3 of the primary series), and vomiting (following 
Dose 1 of the primary series). 
The proportions of preterm infants with maximum body temperature measurements based on the 
Brighton Collaboration cut points after each dose in the primary series, after the toddler dose, and 
after any dose were generally comparable in both intervention groups. The proportion of preterm 
infants in each intervention group reporting a maximum body temperature ≥40.0˚C (104.0˚F) was low 
(<2%) following any dose 
Serious adverse event/death 
The proportions of participants with SAEs reported after any dose were generally comparable in both 
intervention groups. SAEs were reported across multiple SOCs and most frequently in the Infections 
and Infestations SOC. No SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study intervention. 
There were no deaths reported for preterm infants in the integrated population. 
AE of special interest 
No AEs or SAEs of apnea (preferred terms: apnea, apneic attack, breath holding, or sleep apnea 
syndrome) were reported in the integrated preterm population within the protocol-specified reporting 
periods. 
CHMP’s comment 
In total 211 pre-term infants were exposed to V114. The pre-term infants were part of the healthy 
infant population described above. The safety database of 221 pre-term infants is considered limited, 
but sufficient to determine the safety profile as it can be compared to the safety profile in the healthy 
infants. 
The safety profile in preterm infants was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the 
healthy infants. In line with the results for the healthy participants, the vast majority of participants 
experienced at least 1 AE in both treatment arms, of which the majority experienced at least 1 
vaccine-related AE. The majority of AEs was mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequently 
reported AEs were identical in the preterm infants as compared to the total population, with the most 
frequently reported AEs being pyrexia, injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, injection-site 
induration, injection site swelling, irritability, somnolence and decreased appetite. Vaccine-related AEs 
were also comparable between both treatment groups and preterm infants and total population. The 
proportion of participants with maximum body temperature measurements based on the Brighton 
Collaboration cut points were comparable between intervention groups and total healthy infant 
population.

Page 126/150 
 
 
 
  
 
There was a slight numerical increase in the percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 AE 
in both treatment arms, indicating a slight increase in reactogenicity in preterm infants. 
The percentage of participants experiencing SAEs was comparable between the treatment arms. None 
of the SAEs was considered related to the vaccine. 
Apnea is considered a risk after intramuscular injection of vaccines in preterm infants. No AEs or SAEs 
related to apnea were observed during the studies. Considering the fact that only 221 preterm infants 
were included in the studies, it is appreciated that a warning is in place in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Sickle cell disease 
The proportions of participants with AEs, including injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, and SAEs, were 
generally comparable in both intervention groups Table 50. No vaccine-related SAEs, deaths, or 
discontinuations from study intervention due to AEs were reported.

Of the participants with solicited AEs graded by intensity, the majority of participants experienced 
solicited AEs with a maximum intensity of mild or moderate in both intervention groups. 
CHMP’s comment 
The safety of V114 was evaluated in study V114-023, in which children 5 through 17 years of age with 
SCD were exposed to V114 (69 children) or PCV13 (34 children).  
In both intervention groups the majority of participants experienced at least 1 or more AEs and even 1 
or more vaccine-related AEs. Vaccine-related injection-site AEs were experienced by the majority of 
participants in both treatment groups, with the proportion being slightly lower in the V114 group

compared to the PCV13 group; 69.6% vs 76.5% respectively. The most commonly reported AEs in 
both treatment groups were injection site pain and injection-site swelling.  
Vaccine-related systemic AEs were more commonly reported in the V114 group compared to the 
PCV13 group: 40.6% vs 20.6%. This difference was mainly driven by myalgia, which was reported for 
20.3% of participants in the V114 group compared to 5.9% in the PCV13 group. The most commonly 
reported systemic AEs were myalgia, headache and fatigue in both treatment groups, though in 
different proportions, with in the V114 group 20.3% of participants experienced myalgia, 17.4% 
headache and 11.6% fatigue, while in the PCV13 group 14.7% of participants experienced fatigue, 
8.8% headache and 5.9% myalgia. 
A slight difference was observed between the sex subgroups in the V114 group, with V114 being more 
reactogenic in females compared to males. Due to small numbers no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Due to small numbers no comparison between race or ethnic subgroups can be made, as only 1 
subgroup met predefined criteria of at least 5% of population for both race and ethnic subgroups. 
Black or African American participants reported higher frequencies of systemic vaccine-related AEs 
after V114 compared to PCV13 (43.2% vs 16.0%). Similar tendencies were also observed for Hispanic 
or Latino participants who reported higher vaccine-related systemic AEs after V114 compared to 
Prevenar 13 (38.6% vs 25.0%). These differences have not been observed in the general healthy 
population. Due to the small sample size no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
In the 5 to 9 year old population, the proportion of participants experiencing injection-site AEs was 
higher compared to the 10-14 year old population, while the proportion of participants experiencing 
systemic AEs was lower. The proportion of participants with SAEs was higher in the 5 to 9 year old 
population compared to 10-14 year olds. However, again the subgroups are small, making firm 
conclusions difficult. 
The safety profile in children with SCD was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the 
healthy infants. The most commonly reported AEs were injection-site pain and injection site swelling. 
Vaccine-related systemic AEs were more commonly reported in the V114 group compared to the 
PCV13 group, with the difference being driven by more frequently reported myalgia. No new safety 
signals were identified. 
HIV-1 infected subjects 
The proportions of participants with 1 or more AEs were generally comparable in both intervention 
groups. Vaccine-related injection-site and systemic AEs were reported for a higher proportion of 
participants in the V114 group following vaccination with PCV. 
AEs were reported for the majority (>69%) of participants in both intervention groups. One participant 
in the V114 group and 1 participant in the PCV13 group experienced 1 or more SAEs; no SAEs were 
considered to be vaccine-related, Table 53. No deaths were reported during the study.

The proportions of participants with AEs (solicited and unsolicited) by maximum intensity were 
generally comparable in both intervention groups following vaccination with PCV. Of the participants 
with solicited AEs graded by intensity, the majority had events with a maximum intensity of mild in 
both intervention groups. The proportions of participants with solicited AEs that were severe in 
maximum intensity were low and comparable in both the V114 and PCV13 groups (2.5% and 2.0%, 
respectively). Of the participants with solicited AEs in both intervention groups, the majority had 
events of short duration (≤3 days) following vaccination with PCV. 
CHMP’s comment 
The safety of V114 was evaluated in study V114-030, in which children 6 through 17 years of age 
living with HIV (CD4+ Tcell count ≥200 cell/µL and plasma HIV RNA of <50,000 copies/mL) were 
exposed to V114 (203 children) or PCV13 (204 children).  
In both intervention groups the majority of participants experienced at least 1 or more AEs and even 1 
or more vaccine-related AEs. The most commonly reported AEs, >20% of participants, in both 
treatment groups were injection site pain, myalgia and injection-stie swelling.  
Vaccine-related injection-site AEs were experienced by the majority of participants in both treatment 
groups, with the proportion being higher in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group; 71.4% vs 
59.8% respectively. Vaccine-related systemic AEs were more commonly reported in the V114 group 
compared to the PCV13 group: 40.6% vs 20.6%. These differences were driven by an overall slightly 
more reactogenic profile of V114. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 131/150 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile observed in participants with CD4+ T-cell counts of ≥200 to <500 cells/µL and ≥500 
cells/µL was largely comparable. Considering the small number of participants with CD4+ T-cell counts 
of ≥200 to <500 cells/µL (n=17) no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
No clear trends were observed in between the age subgroups. A slight difference was observed 
between the sex subgroups in the V114 group, with V114 being more reactogenic in females compared 
to males. However, considering the small differences, no impact is expected. Comparable to the total 
population, a trend towards higher reactogenicity in White subjects was observed for both intervention 
groups compared to Asian participants. Reactogenicity was even higher in Black subjects. However, 
again due to small numbers no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
The safety profile in children with HIV was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the 
healthy infants. No new safety signals were identified. 
Age: determined using the catch-up vaccination study 
The safety profiles of 1 (2 to 17 years of age), 2 (12 through 23 months of age), or 3-dose (7 through 
11 months of age) catch-up regimens of V114 were generally comparable to those of PCV13.  
The proportions of participants with AEs following any dose were generally comparable between 
intervention groups for each age group evaluated. The majority of reported injection-site and systemic 
AEs in both intervention groups were transient and of mild to moderate intensity. 
While the proportions of participants with AEs was higher in the V114 group compared with the PCV13 
group for participants 12 through 23 months of age (mainly due to higher proportions of participants 
with solicited AEs of injection-site pain and irritability these results may not be clinically meaningful 
given the small sample size analysed in this age group.

PCV=pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (V114 or Prevnar 13™). 
Across all age groups evaluated in V114-024 (7 through 11 months, 12 through 23 months, and 
2 through 17 years), the most frequently reported AEs after each dose of PCV were mainly the solicited 
injection-site and systemic events in both intervention groups and were generally comparable in both 
intervention groups. 
CHMP’s comment 
Overall, in line with the healthy infant population, the safety profile per age group was comparable 
between the treatment groups. In addition, the most frequently reported AEs after each dose were 
mainly the solicited injection-site and systemic events and the unsolicited AE of pyrexia. No new safety 
signals were observed in older children. 
Of note, in children aged 2 to <6 years of age a substantially lower reactogenicity was observed 
compared to the healthy infant population, while the reactogenicity profile in children aged >6 to 
17 years of age was found to be largely comparable to the healthy infant population. This is thought to 
be due to small numbers in the different age groups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant vaccines were administered in both the V114 and PCV13 intervention groups in Studies 
V114-025, V114-027, and V114-029, as prespecified in the study protocols. Studies V114-008, V114-
024, and V114-031 permitted the administration of non-study routine childhood vaccines according to 
the recommended schedule for paediatric vaccination.

CHMP’s comment 
The safety of V114 was evaluated while childhood vaccines could be concomitantly administered.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, 4 participants had AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation during the protocol specified 
reporting period in studies V114-008, V114-027, and V114-030.  
During study V114-008, 2 participants discontinued study vaccine due to an AE. One participant in the 
V114 Lot 1 group discontinued V114 following vaccination 1 due to a nonserious, vaccine-related AE of 
rash, and 1 participant in the V114 Lot 2 group discontinued V114 following vaccination 1 due to a 
serious, vaccine-related AE of febrile convulsion.  
During study V114-027 1 participant enrolled in group 3 discontinued study intervention due to a 
vaccine-related SAE (epilepsy) that occurred within the protocol-defined reporting period. The SAE 
occurred after dose 2 (PCV13). Dose 3, V114, was administered prior to withdrawal of the participant. 
During study V114-030, 1 participant in the PCV13 group discontinued study intervention (ie, did not 
receive PPV23 at Week 8) due to vaccine-related AEs of injection-site erythema, injection-site 
induration, and injection-site swelling following PCV13. 
CHMP’s comment 
It is acknowledged that the number of discontinuations due to AEs is low (n=4 in total) and 
comparable between intervention groups. AEs were reported across multiple SOCs with no AEs being 
reported more than once. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety of V114 was evaluated in 8 clinical trials in which in total, 5,366 infants and children 
received at least 1 dose of V114 and 3,491 infants and children received at least 1 dose of PCV13. The 
active comparator PCV13 was included in all 8 studies (V114-008, V114-023, V114-024, V114-025, 
V114-027, V114-029, V114-030 and V114-031). 
Reactogenicity was followed for 14 days when concerning solicited injection-site and systemic reactions 
and for 7 days concerning body temperature, which is considered appropriate (see Guideline on clinical 
evaluation of vaccines). Subjects were followed for 6 months, which is considered a sufficient period of 
time to collect relevant adverse events (except for study V114-008 where follow-up was limited to 
30 days). This strategy led to a sufficient period of time to collect information on the outcome of the 
adverse events. 
An integrated safety analysis was performed for 4 studies, including healthy infants from 
approximately 2 months of age: V114-025, V114-027 [Groups 1 and 5 only], V114-029, and V114-
031. Safety results obtained from the other studies were analysed separately. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 134/150 
 
 
 
  
 
Exposure  
Overall, 5,366 participants received at least 1 dose of V114, of which 211 were preterm infants. In 
total 303 participants received V114 as a catch-up regimen, 69 had sickle cell disease (SCD) and 203 
were HIV infected. The majority of studies allowed for concomitant vaccination with routine childhood 
vaccines. The size and composition of the safety database is considered sufficient for the assessment 
of the safety profile of V114. However, the size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare 
adverse events. In addition, as only 177 healthy children aged 2 to 17 years of age were administered 
V114, the information on the safety profile in this population is limited. The MAH has committed to 
collect information on rare but serious AEs systemically post-licensure.  
Adverse Events 
Integrated safety population 
The safety profile in the integrated safety population for V114 was generally comparable to the safety 
profile of PCV13. The majority of participants in both treatment groups experienced at least 1 AE. AEs 
were experienced by a comparable proportion of participants in both treatment groups, as the 
percentage of participants experiencing the different AEs did not differ more than 10%. V114 was 
slightly more reactogenic compared to PCV13, as the majority of AEs occurred slightly more frequently 
after injection with V114 compared to PCV13. The most commonly reported vaccine-related AEs were 
mostly solicited AEs and identical in both the V114 and PCV13 group: irritability (67.7% vs 62.8%), 
somnolence (48.5% vs 45.7%), injection-site pain (44.4% vs 39.4%), injection-site erythema (41.7% 
vs 40.5%), decreased appetite (29.8% vs 26.2%), pyrexia (29.8% vs 28.2%), injection-site induration 
(28.3% vs 30.8%), and injection-site swelling (28.2% vs 25.3%). In both intervention groups, the 
majority of participants had solicited AEs which were mild to moderate in intensity, with a size ≤2 
inches (5.1 cm) and short duration (≤3 days). 
The safety profile as determined using the integrated safety population was largely comparable to the 
profile as determined in the underlying studies. In all studies the safety profile of V114 was 
comparable to PCV13, with the most frequently reported AEs following any dose being solicited AEs. 
The majority of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and of short duration. Differences in the 
PTs reported and the proportion of participants experiencing AEs occurred across the studies, however 
no clear trends or safety signals could be observed in the separate studies. 
Sex, race and ethnicity 
In the integrated analysis, no clear trends were observed with respect to reactogenicity between males 
and females or ethnic subgroups in the V114 group. A trend towards higher reactogenicity in White 
subjects was observed for both intervention groups compared to Asian and multiple race participants. 
However, these results do not give rise to concern. 
Overall, the safety profile in the different subgroups of sex, race and ethnicity was similar to the safety 
profile in the entire population and no new safety signals are observed. 
Potential effect of antipyretics use 
The use of antipyretics differs between studies (e.g. paracetamol V114-025: ~48%, V114-029: ~67%, 
V114-024: ~25-35%, V114-027: ~6%, 008: no use of paracetamol). The use of antipyretics was 
balanced between treatment arms. Additional tables were provided and in each study the percentage 
of individuals with AE was higher in the group receiving antipyretics compared with no antipyretic 
intake. Although only overall numbers of participants receiving antipyretics were presented per study, 
not individual timepoints of antipyretic intake per subject, the presented data indicate that there are

no differences between treatment groups. 
Special population 
Preterm infants 
In total 211 pre-term infants were exposed to V114. The safety database for pre-term infants is 
considered limited, but sufficient to determine the safety profile as it can be compared to the safety 
profile in the healthy infants included in the same study. 
The safety profile in preterm infants was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the 
healthy infants. The most frequently reported vaccine-related AEs were identical in the preterm infants 
as compared to the total population, with the most frequently reported AEs being pyrexia, injection-
site pain, injection-site erythema, injection-site induration, injection site swelling, irritability, 
somnolence and decreased appetite. There was a slight numerical increase in the percentage of 
participants who experienced at least 1 AE in both treatment arms compared to the total healthy infant 
population, indicating a slight increase in reactogenicity in preterm infants. 
The percentage of participants experiencing SAEs was comparable between the treatment arms. None 
of the SAEs was considered related to the vaccine in the preterm infant population. 
No new safety signals were identified. 
Immunocompromised 
The safety of a single administration of V114 in children 5 through 17 years of age with SCD was 
evaluated in study V114-024. In total, 69 children were exposed to V114 and 34 to PCV13. The safety 
profile in children with SCD was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the healthy 
infants. The most commonly reported AEs were injection-site pain and injection site swelling. Vaccine-
related systemic AEs were more commonly reported in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group, 
with the difference being driven by more frequently reported myalgia. No new safety signals were 
identified. 
The safety of a single administration of V114 in children 6 through 17 years of age living with HIV 
(CD4+ T cell count ≥200 cell/µL and plasma HIV RNA of <50,000 copies/mL) was evaluated in study 
V114-030. In total, 203 children were exposed to V114 and 204 to PCV13. The safety profile in 
children with HIV was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the healthy infants. In both 
intervention groups the majority of participants experienced at least 1 or more AEs and even 1 or 
more vaccine-related AEs. The most commonly reported AEs, >20% of participants, in both treatment 
groups were injection site pain, myalgia and injection-stie swelling. Vaccine-related systemic AEs were 
more commonly reported in the V114 group compared to the PCV13 group: 40.6% vs 20.6%. This 
difference was driven by an overall slightly more reactogenic profile of V114. No new safety signals 
were identified. 
The safety profile observed in participants with CD4+ T-cell counts of ≥200 to <500 cells/µL and ≥500 
cells/µL was largely comparable. Considering the small number of participants with CD4+ T-cell counts 
of ≥200 to <500 cells/µL (n=17) no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Interestingly in both participants with SCD and living with HIV-1 infection, a slight difference was 
observed between the sex subgroups in the V114 group, with V114 being more reactogenic in females 
compared to males. However, considering the small differences, no impact is expected. 
Catch-up vaccination 
The safety profiles of 1-, 2- , or 3-dose catch-up regimens of V114 given to 2 to 17 years of age, 12 
through 23 months of age or 7 through 11 months of age respectively was evaluated in study V114-
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 136/150 
 
 
 
  
 
027. In total, 64 children 7 to 11 months were exposed to V114 and 64 to PVC13, 62 children aged 12 
to 23 months of age were exposed to V114 and 64 to PCV13 and 177 children aged 2 to 17 years of 
age were exposed to V114 and 175 to PCV13. 
Overall, in line with the healthy infant population, the safety profile per age group was comparable 
between the treatment groups. In addition, the most frequently reported AEs after each dose were 
mainly the solicited injection-site and systemic events and the unsolicited AE of pyrexia. No new safety 
signals were observed in older children. 
Of note, the reactogenicity in children aged 2 to <6 years of age was substantially lower compared to 
the healthy infant population, while the reactogenicity profile in children aged >6 to 17 years of age 
was found to be largely comparable to the healthy infant population. This is thought to be due to small 
numbers in the different age groups. 
Serious Adverse Events and Death 
Overall, in all 8 studies submitted the proportions of participants experiencing SAEs were comparable 
across intervention groups and the majority of SAEs were in the SOC Infections and Infestations. In 
total 5 SAEs were considered related to the vaccine by the investigator. However, for 1 additional SAE 
of febrile convulsion experienced by a participant in the V114 group, the SAE is considered to be 
related to the vaccine taking into consideration that no other causality was provided and the timing of 
the event relative to vaccination. In addition, several observations of the assessment of relatedness to 
the vaccine were not followed with regards to PCV13. However, considering the fact that it involves 
PCV13, the issues are not further pursued as it is not considered relevant for the current procedure. 
The number of deaths in the 8 studies is low and comparable between study interventions, as in the 
V114 group 3 out of 5366 participants (0.06%) died and 2 out of 3491 participants (0.06%) in the 
PCV13 group. The narratives of participants who died were reviewed and no indication of a causal 
relationship to the vaccine could be identified, although one death due to unknown cause which 
occurred during study V114-008 must be regarded as speculative due to the lack of additional 
information. 
Discontinuations 
During the 8 studies submitted during this procedure, 4 participants discontinued due to AEs. The 
number of discontinuations is low. The AEs causing the discontinuations were reported across multiple 
SOCs with no AEs being reported more than once.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of V114 appears to be similar to the safety profile of PCV13. It is a reactogenic 
vaccine, with the majority of participants reporting 1 or more AEs; however, these were mostly mild or 
moderate in intensity and of short duration (≤3 days). The most frequently reported vaccine-related 
AEs by PT were the solicited AEs of irritability, somnolence, injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, 
decreased appetite, injection-site swelling, and injection-site induration and the unsolicited AE of 
pyrexia. Overall, the proportions of participants with SAEs were comparable across intervention 
groups. Very few SAEs were considered related to the study vaccine. 
In conclusion, V114 is well tolerated in infants and children. However, compared to PCV13, V114 is 
slightly more reactogenic. This increase in reactogenicity has no further clinical implications.

2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  A user consultation (full testing report of the 855x450mm patient leaflet [06DKGB] and a 
bridging report to a 210x550mm patient leaflet [06DQJY]) has recently been conducted as part 
of the Marketing Authorisation granted for the vaccine Vaxneuvance in December 2021.  
• 
The proposed additions related to the safe use of this vaccine are not expected to impact the 
package leaflet readability for patients and are limited to the proposed paediatric indication. 
The following additions have been made: 
- 
- 
section 1: to reflect the proposed indication for the paediatric population 
section 2: to include information references to the paediatric population and align with the 
proposed updates made to the SmPC using patient-friendly terms 
- 
section 3: to add the different vaccination schedules (depending on the age of the 
paediatric population) and administration site relevant to children 
- 
section 4: to list the possible side effects encountered in the paediatric population. The 
additional side effects are presented in patient-friendly terms  
-

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed added indication is: 
Vaxneuvance is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia 
and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 
6 weeks to less than 18 years of age. 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), which causes pneumococcal disease (PD), remains a 
major cause of vaccine preventable PD worldwide with considerable morbidity and mortality, in infants, 
children, and adults. Clinical manifestations of pneumococcal disease include invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) and non-invasive disease. IPD can lead to meningitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, bacteraemic 
pneumonia, and septic arthritis. The non-invasive disease can present as, e.g. acute otitis media, 
sinusitis and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options: 
Treatment of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is based on clinical presentation and antimicrobial 
susceptibility data. Initial treatment of IPD generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, that have 
efficacy against S.pneumoniae as well as other likely pathogens. The increase in pneumococcal 
resistance to penicillin and other commonly used antimicrobial agents complicates treatment decisions 
and may lead to treatment failures with subsequent increased morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Prevention options: 
Prevention of PD in children includes routine childhood vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines (PCVs) as well as prophylactic use of antibiotics and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPV) in special populations (e.g., children with functional or anatomic asplenia).  
Currently two vaccines are licensed for this indication in children in the EU: Prevenar13 (PCV13) and 
Synflorix (only for children up to 5 years of age). Another unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine is 
licensed but not for the intended infant population (PNEUMOVAX23; PPV23). 
Unmet medical need: 
Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, there has been an overall reduction in the incidence 
of IPD, however pneumococcal disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity. A decrease 
in the incidence of pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes included in the currently licensed 
vaccines, except serotype 3, was observed across all age groups. However, strain replacement is a 
concern as in multiple regions, a significant increase in disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes in 
both children and adults has been observed. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 141/150 
 
 
 
  
 
IPD cases caused by 2 serotypes not included in vaccines currently licensed for use in children, 22F 
and 33F, have increased in frequency in several regions and countries. The two serotypes 22F and 33F 
cause 8.5% and 6.8% of IPD in children <1 and children 1 to 4 years of age in the EU. Serotype 22F 
and 33F are known to be among the serotypes with the highest invasive capacity (Yildirim I et al. 
Vaccine 2011) and are associated with serious clinical outcomes. 
Due to the disease severity of IPD and the healthcare burden of residual disease due to non-vaccine 
serotypes, prevention of pneumococcal disease remains an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies for evaluating the immunogenicity of V114 are the 2 Phase 3 studies 
V114-025 and V114-029. Both studies are randomized, multicentre, double-blind, active comparator 
controlled (PCV13) studies evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V114. 
Study V114-025 enrolled healthy infants at approximately 2 months of age (from 42 to 90 days 
[inclusive]) who were randomized (1:1) to receive either V114 or PCV13. Treatment consisted of a 2-
dose primary series in full-term infants administered IM at 2 and 4 months of age approximately 
followed by a toddler dose at 11 to 15 months of age, and in preterm infants a 3 dose primary series 
was administered IM at approximately 2, 3, and 4 months of age from date of birth (not corrected) 
followed by a toddler dose at 11 to 15 months of age. In total, 588 participants received at least 1 
dose of V114 IM, and 592 received at least 1 dose of PCV13.  
Study V114-029 enrolled healthy infants at approximately 2 months of age (from 42 to 90 days 
[inclusive]) who were randomized (1:1) to receive either V114 or PCV13. Treatment consisted of a 3-
dose primary series in both full-term and preterm infants administered IM at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
from date of birth (not corrected for preterm infants) approximately, followed by a toddler dose at 12 
to 15 months of age. In total, 859 participants received at least 1 dose of V114 IM, and 856 received 
at least 1 dose of PCV13. 
Overall, the design of the presented main studies is similar and considered adequate. In all studies the 
subjects received a regimen of V114 or PCV13 which is in line with the approved dosing regimen for 
PCV13 and the proposed regimen for V114. Immunogenicity was evaluated 30 days after primary 
series and immediately prior to the toddler dose and 30 days after the toddler dose. In the main 
studies, participants also received routine childhood vaccinations. The study populations included the 
main populations reflects the target population for vaccination with V114.  
In line with EMA guidance, in a scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III) it was agreed to 
base the clinical development programme on immunogenicity studies and that no efficacy studies are 
required. The non-inferiority margin of -0.1 for the difference (V114 minus PCV13) in response rate 
and 0.5 for the GMC ratio (V114/PCV13) for the 13 shared serotypes has been agreed in the scientific 
advice (EMEA/H/SA/1492/1/FU/1/2017/III). 
The following supportive studies were submitted: 
•  Study V114-027 investigated the interchangeability of both PCV13 and V114 in infants aged 
approximately 2 months of age.  
•  Study V114-024 investigated the immunogenicity of catch-up vaccination with V114 in children 
aged 7 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months and 2 to 17 years of age.  
•  Study V114-023 investigated the immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 in children aged 5 to 
17 years of age with sickle cell disease. 
•  Study V114-030 investigated the immunogenicity of a single dose of V114 in children 6 to 17 
years of age living with HIV-1 infection.

•  Study V114-008, a Phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 
different lots of V114. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Response rate. At 30 days post toddler dose, the vast majority of participants achieved the threshold 
of 0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes included in V114, indicating adequate protection against IPD.  
Comparability to PCV13. Both V114 and PCV13 were immunogenic in all studies and subgroups 
tested. V114 was shown to be non-inferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes at 30 days post 
toddler dose in both pivotal studies, based on the IgG GMCs with the predefined non-inferiority margin 
of the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the serotype-specific IgG GMC ratio [V114/ PCV13] being 
greater than 0.5 for each serotype. In addition, the difference in the response rates [V114 minus 
PCV13] were smaller than 10 percentage points for each serotype at 30 days post toddler dose in both 
pivotal studies. The RCDCs of the 13 shared serotypes showed a similar pattern for the V114 group 
and the PCV13 group. Visually, the curves show a similar distribution, indicating that both vaccines 
induced a comparable immune response. 
Serotype 3. In both pivotal studies serotype 3 showed consistently higher IgG GMCs (Study 025: 
1.28, Study 029: 1.35) and seroresponse rates (Study 025: 92% vs 84%, Study 029: 95% vs 80%) 
with Vaxneuvance. These aspects were observed in all studies. 
Additional serotypes 22F and 33F. A substantial immune response was measured for both 
additional serotypes, which was non-inferior to the lowest response seen for the 13 shared serotypes 
(except serotype 3). At 30 days post toddler dose, the vast majority of participants achieved IgG GMCs 
which fell well above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL in all studies, indicating an immune response that is 
likely to offer protection against IPD. 
Immune memory. In all studies, the antibody concentration decreased over time as IgG GMCs 
immediately prior to the toddler dose were lower compared to 30 days post primary series (PPS) in 
both treatment arms. The toddler dose increased IgG GMCs to levels comparable to or higher than 
PPS. This indicates that immune memory is induced. 
Preterm infants. Both 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, the vast majority of participants achieved the 
threshold value of 0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes after vaccination with V114. 
Immunocompromised. In both participants with SCD and living with HIV-1 infection, a single 
administration of V114 induced IgG GMCs against all serotypes contained in the vaccine which were 
well above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL. This indicates that the response generated was substantial 
and clinically relevant. 
Interchangeability. The interchangeability study (027) investigated the immune response after 
switching from PCV13 to V114 at different time points during the 3 + 1 regimen. IgG GMCs were 
overall comparable for the 13 shared serotypes between the groups which switched to V114 after the 
initial two doses with PCV13. Response rates for the shared serotypes remained high in all groups.  
Catch-up vaccination. In general, catch-up vaccination with V114 elicited serotype-specific immune 
responses, as assessed by IgG GMCs at 30 days following the last dose of study intervention, for all 15 
serotypes contained in the vaccine. The observed immune response is comparable to infants 
immunized in due time (data from pivotal studies). 
Concomitant vaccination with routine childhood vaccines. The immune response to the 
concomitantly administered vaccines was comparable between the V114 and PCV13 group, indicating 
that the generation of the immune response was not impacted differently by the 2 treatment arms. All 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 143/150 
 
 
 
  
 
responses for the concomitant vaccines showed a within 5 percentage points difference between the 
treatment arms. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy/effectiveness data. No efficacy or effectiveness data is available for V114 in infants and 
children. The evaluation of the protective effect of the V114 vaccine regimen is based on bridging 
clinical immunogenicity results to immunogenicity data of a licensed pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13, 
that has been shown to be effective.  
Correlate of protection. There is no correlate of protection known for pneumonia or AOM. The 
indications of pneumonia and AOM were granted to PCV13 based on non-inferiority of immune 
response to PCV7. PCV13 has been shown to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in 
vaccinated children has been observed. However, no exact vaccine efficacy was determined, nor the 
immune response required to achieve protection. Therefore, the strategy of non-inferiority testing for 
V114 to PCV13 introduces the possibility of biocreep for the shared serotypes, considering that the 
immune response required to induce a protective effect is unknown. In addition, whether the correlate 
of protection also applies for the new serotypes included in V114, is currently unknown.  
Reduced immunogenicity response. Generally, the immune response to V114 was numerically 
lower compared to PCV13 as assessed by IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotype. When comparing IgG 
GMCs generated by V114 to PCV13, the GMC ratio fell below 1 for the majority of the shared 
serotypes. In addition, across all studies, the serotype 6A IgG GMCs elicited by V114 were 
substantially lower compared to the IgG GMCs elicited by PCV13. Finally, a lower immune response is 
seen in study V114-025, leading to slightly lower response rates, indicating that the immune reaction 
induced by the 2-dose primary series is reduced compared to the 3-dose primary series. 
Persistence of protective effect. The data indicate that IgG concentrations decline at a similar rate 
after vaccination with V114 and PCV13 and consequently also the response rates. Given hat the initial 
concentrations were lower with V114, it could be assumed that the protective effect of V114 might 
wane earlier compared to PCV13. Since no data after a longer period are available 
Failed study. In principle the pivotal study V114-029 failed, as not all of the primary objectives were 
met. The IgG GMC for serotype 6A did not meet non-inferiority criteria based on IgG GMCs at 30 days 
PPS.  
Serotype 6A. In several studies, including the 2 pivotal studies, serotype 6A showed the most 
pronounced difference between V114 and PCV13. While after the primary series the GMC ratio was 
even below 0.5 in several studies, the ratios increased after the toddler dose, but remain the lowest of 
all 13 shared serotypes.  
Prophylactic use of antipyretics. In a post-marketing study of PCV13, it has been observed that the 
prophylactic use of antipyretics (ibuprofen and paracetamol) reduced the immune response especially 
after the primary series. In general, the use of paracetamol was overall balanced between groups in all 
respective studies. Further, subgroup analyses based on antipyretic use showed similar pattern for 
both vaccines in changes in IgG GMCs in subjects with concomitant antipyretic use compared to 
subjects that did not use of antipyretics. A correlation with age could not be evaluated since data in 
older subjects was limited. 
Serotype 3 and 33F in the interchangeability study. Switching the toddler dose from PCV13 to 
V114 does not impact the effect for the 13 shared serotypes, however, an additional benefit for 
serotype 3 and 33F cannot be assumed for subjects that only switched after the primary series.

HIV-positive subjects: The majority of participants (91.6%) had CD4+ T-cell count ≥500 cells/μL 
and the data for participants with CD4+ T-cell count <500 cells/μL i.e. are very limited.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events. The safety profile of V114 was comparable to the safety profile of PCV13. For both 
interventions, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more AEs in all studies and the most 
commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs.  
In healthy infants approximately 2 months of age, 93.7% of participants experienced 1 or more AE, 
and 89.4% experienced a vaccine-related AE. The most commonly reported vaccine-related AEs were: 
irritability (67.7%), somnolence (48.5%), injection-site pain (44.4%), injection-site erythema 
(41.7%), decreased appetite (29.8%), pyrexia (29.8%), injection-site induration (28.3%), and 
injection-site swelling (28.2%). 
In both intervention groups, the majority of participants had events which were mild to moderate in 
intensity, with a size ≤2 inches (5.1 cm) and short duration (≤3 days). 
SAEs and Deaths. Overall, the proportions of participants with SAEs were comparable across 
intervention groups and the majority of SAEs were in the SOC Infections and Infestations. Very few 
SAEs were considered related to the vaccine, which is agreed. Five participant deaths were reported in 
the 8 studies. Narratives of participants who died were reviewed and no indication of a causal 
relationship to the vaccine could be identified. 
Discontinuations due to AE. In total 4 participants had AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation. 
AEs were reported across multiple SOCs with no AEs being reported more than once. 
The safety profile in preterm infants, participants with SCD and participants living with HIV-1 infection 
was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the healthy infants. No new safety signals 
were identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety database. In total, 5,366 participants received at least 1 dose of V114, of which 211 were 
preterm infants. The size of the safety database limits the detection of more rare adverse events. In 
addition the safety database in children aged 2 to 17 years of age (n=177) is limited and limits 
assessment of safety profile in this age category. Information on rare but serious AEs should be 
systematically collected post-licensure. 
Immediate and vaccine-related AEs. More information with regard to immediate and vaccine-
related AEs is requested. 
Assessment of relatedness of SAEs: The assessment provided by the investigator of non-
relatedness to study vaccine was not followed for 1 SAE experienced by a participant in the V114 
group.

1)V114-029 has met its primary immunogenicity objectives regarding non-inferiority of V114 compared to PCV13 with 
respect to response rate for the 13 shared serotypes; lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in the 
response rates [V114 minus PCV13] being greater than -10 percentage points for each serotype).  
2) V114-025, for serotype 6A the difference in the response rates [V114 minus PCV13] was greater than 10 
percentage points,-19.4%. 
3) V114-025 met the primary immunogenicity objectives regarding non-inferiority of V114 compared to PCV13 with 
respect to response rate for the 13 shared serotypes; lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in the 
response rates [V114 minus PCV13] being greater than -10 percentage points for each serotype). 
Since comparisons were made individually for each of the 15 serotypes, this approach controls the 1-sided type-I 
error rate at 0.025, and no multiplicity adjustment was required. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
This submission does not contain efficacy studies and is based on the inference of V114 effectiveness 
for the prevention of vaccine serotype-specific pneumococcal disease by demonstration of noninferior 
immune responses to the 13 shared serotypes in PCV13. A surrogate of protection, IgG of 0.35 µg/mL, 
has been established for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children, which can be used to infer 
protection against IPD. However, it needs to be taken into consideration that whether the correlate of 
protection also applies for the new serotypes included in V114, is currently unknown. In addition, for 
pneumonia and acute otitis media (AOM) no correlate or surrogate of protection exists. The indications 
of pneumonia and AOM were granted to PCV13 based on non-inferiority of immune response to PCV7. 
PCV13 has been shown to be effective, as a reduction in disease prevalence in vaccinated children has

been observed. However, no exact vaccine efficacy was determined, nor the immune response 
required to achieve protection.  Therefore, the strategy of non-inferiority testing for V114 to PCV13 
introduces the possibility of biocreep for the shared serotypes, considering that the immune response 
required to induce a protective effect is unknown. CHMP has already recommended that the MAH 
should conduct post-marketing studies to evaluate vaccine effectiveness against AOM and pneumonia. 
The post-marketing program should also include population-based surveillance of the incidence rates 
of IPD in several different countries for an appreciable number of years using national surveillance 
systems, in particular for the new serotypes for which efficacy against IPD is not known. 
V114 induced an immune response to all serotypes included in the vaccine in all studies and subgroups 
tested. The immune response induced by V114 was consistent across studies, the FAS population 
showed results comparable to the PP population and the results as assessed by OPA antibodies were in 
line with the IgG GMCs, indicating a robust response. At 30 days post toddler dose the IgG GMCs for 
all serotypes was well above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL for all serotypes in all studies. The response 
rate, defined as the proportion of participants achieving IgG of ≥0.35 µg/mL, was ≥92% for all 
serotypes. These results indicate that V114 induced a substantial immune response that is likely to 
offer protection against IPD.  
The immune response induced by V114 as assessed by IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotypes was 
numerically lower compared to the response induced by PCV13, with the GMC ratio falling below 1 for 
the majority of serotypes. However, the response rate, defined as the proportion of participants 
achieving ≥0.35 µg/mL, was largely comparable and indicated that the majority of participants in both 
treatment groups achieved the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL. Although given the high response rates no 
concerns about the immediate protective effect after completion of the dosing regimen are raised, the 
implications of this lower response on immune persistence are not known. Data collected prior to the 
administration of the booster dose (Pre toddler dose) indicate that IgG concentrations and 
consequently also the response rates decline at a similar rate after vaccination with V114 and PCV13. 
Given that the initial concentrations were lower with V114, it could be assumed that the protective 
effect of V114 might wane earlier compared to PCV13. PSURs, including information on breakthrough 
disease/vaccine failure, serotype distribution and incidence of IPD will provide an indication on impact 
of the lower titres on immune persistence as frequency of IPD is reported per age category.   
At 30 days post primary series (PPS), the response to serotype 6A was substantially lower in the V114 
group compared to the PCV13 group, leading to not meeting non-inferiority criteria in one of the two 
pivotal studies: IgG GMC non-inferiority criteria during study V114-029. However, as the IgG GMCs for 
serotype 6A in both pivotal studies was still well above the threshold of 0.35 µg/mL at 30 days PPS, 
the clinical impact on protection against IPD is considered limited.  
The response induced by serotype 3 and the 2 additional serotypes was substantially higher after V114 
vaccination compared to vaccination with PCV13. This is considered clinically relevant as these are 
serotypes that are still causing significant disease burden. While this has been established for both full 
vaccination regimen, the benefit might not be achieved when switching from PCV13 to V114 late in the 
dosing regimen. 
Overall, the immune response induced by the 2-dose primary series evaluated in study V114-025 was 
lower compared to the immune response induced by the 3-dose primary series, leading to slightly 
lower response rates in study V114-025. However, at 30 days PPS and 30 days PTD, GMC ratios were 
comparable between both pivotal studies, indicating that while V114 generated the lowest immune 
response in study V114-025, the same holds true for PCV13. 
The potential influence of prophylactic use of antipyretics (ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune 
response, as observed in the post-marketing of PCV13, cannot be ruled out given the current data. The 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
Page 147/150 
 
 
 
  
 
presented results of subgroup analyses based on concomitant antipyretic use (yes/no) are similar for 
both vaccines, indicating a similar effect for both vaccines. Consequently, respective wording in the 
SmPC is required. 
Further, the SmPC should include respective wording reflecting that an additional benefit for serotype 3 
and 33F cannot be assumed for subjects that switched to V114 after the primary series. 
The safety profile of V114 was in general similar to the safety profile of PCV13. In the 8 studies 
submitted in the dossier, no new safety signals were identified for V114 compared to PCV13. V114 was 
well tolerated but slightly more reactogenic, leading to a higher percentage of participants 
experiencing 1 or more AEs. For both interventions, the majority of participants experienced 1 or more 
AEs in all studies and the most commonly reported AEs were solicited AEs. The majority of the AEs 
were mild in intensity and of short duration (≤ 3 days). Overall, the proportions of participants with 
SAEs were comparable across intervention groups and very few were considered related to the 
vaccine. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low. 
The safety profile in preterm infants, participants with SCD and participants living with HIV-1 infection 
was largely comparable to the safety profile as seen for the healthy infants. No new safety signals 
were identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
V114 induces an immune response to all 15 serotypes contained within the vaccine in all studies and 
subpopulations tested. At 30 days post toddler dose the IgG GMCs for all serotypes fell well above the 
threshold of 0.35 µg/mL and a non-inferior immune response of V114 against PCV13 was shown, 
therefore it is considered reasonable to conclude that V114 could provide protection against 
pneumococcal disease.  
The safety profile of V114 is characterised by AEs that are mainly mild to moderate in intensity and of 
short duration. V114 is overall well tolerated with a slightly more unfavourable safety profile compared 
to PCV13. Overall, the beneficial effect associated with V114 outweigh the risks.  
Considering all favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive 
from a clinical perspective. Therefore, the variation to extend the indication of Vaxneuvance is 
approvable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vaxneuvance is positive provided post-authorisation effectiveness data be collected 
within an agreed timeframe.   As current limitations and uncertainties to the beneficial effects of its 
use, it is emphasised that no efficacy or effectiveness data is available for V114 in infants and children. 
The evaluation of the protective effect of the V114 vaccine regimen is based on bridging clinical 
immunogenicity results to immunogenicity data of a licensed pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13, that has 
been shown to be effective. There is no correlate of protection known for pneumonia or AOM, and 
indications of pneumonia and AOM were granted to the study comparator PCV13 based on non-
inferiority of immune response to PCV7; hence the risk of biocreep for the shared serotypes, 
considering that the immune response required to induce a protective effect is unknown.     
Specifically, in view of these considerations, the need to perform a post-marketing effectiveness study 
(PAES) has been identified as a key measure to the benefit risk balance of the new indication. The 
justification is informed by the fact that the current assessment on surrogate endpoints requires 
verification of impact on clinical outcome.

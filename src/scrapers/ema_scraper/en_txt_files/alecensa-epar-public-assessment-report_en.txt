2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Alecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and represents 
a major health problem. 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was first identified as a fusion protein resulting from 
chromosomal translocation in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). When fused to other 
proteins, ALK becomes constitutively active, leading to increased catalytic kinase function, signal transduction 
activity, and oncogenic function. ALK has since been linked with many different fusion partners in different 
tumour types (Soda et al 2007). 
The frequency of ALK gene rearrangements in patients with NSCLC (referred to as ALK positive NSCLC from 
here onwards) is relatively low; it is present in approximately 2 to 7% of tumours tested. However, 
considering the high incidence of lung cancer, this small percentage translates into about 60,000 patients 
annually worldwide (Kwak et al 2010, Shaw et al 2013, Weickhardt et al 2012). 
ALK+ NSCLC exhibit an inversion in chromosome 2 that juxtaposes the 5' end of the echinoderm 
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the 3' end of the ALK gene, resulting in the novel 
fusion oncogene EML4-ALK. EML4-ALK fusion, and ALK fusions with other genes (Kinesin Family member 5B 
[KIF5B]), KLC1 and others define a distinct clinicopathologic subset of NSCLC.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung 
cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except 
non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). 
Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 
583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the United 
States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-
squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous 
cell (epidermoid) carcinoma.

EMA/197343/2017 
Page 10/122 
  
  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ALK gene rearrangements are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR or KRAS mutations (Gainor et al 2013), 
consistent with the notion that ALK gene rearrangements defines a unique molecular subset of NSCLC. In 
these patients, ALK gene rearrangements serve as a key and strong oncogenic driver for NSCLC and 
represent a critical therapeutic target susceptible to targeted ALK kinase inhibition. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Patients with ‘ALK-positive’ tumours (tumours harbouring a rearranged ALK gene/fusion protein) tend to have 
specific clinical features, including never or light smoking history, younger age, NSCLC with adenocarcinoma 
histology, and are highly sensitive to therapy with ALK inhibitors. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Systemic chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the management of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
Standard first-line treatment typically consists of a platinum-based doublet (cisplatin or carboplatin in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents), unless a patient has a known mutation, candidate for targeted 
therapy (NCCN Guidelines v3.2012, Vansteenkiste et al 2013). The outcomes with this type of chemotherapy 
remain poor, with response rates of 15 to 35% and median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) of 4 to 7 months and 10 to 16 months, respectively (Scagliotti et al 2008, Ciuleanu et al 2009, 
Ettinger et al 2010, Paz-Ares et al 2012). 
Pemetrexed/cisplatin (or carboplatin) combination therapy and carboplatin/paclitaxel with (or without) 
bevacizumab represent a therapeutic option in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. These 
regimens are commonly used based on phase III randomised trials (NCCN version 1.2015) 
Recently, pemetrexed-based regimens have been used in adenocarcinomas (if patients are not candidate for 
targeted therapy), because taxane-based regimens are associated with more toxicity (e.g. neurotoxicity). 
The outcomes with second-line chemotherapy are dismal, with response rates of less than 10%, median PFS 
of 2 to 3 months, and median OS of 5 to 8 months (Shepherd et al 2000, Fossella et al 2000, Hanna et al 
2004). 
The ALK-fusion protein is an appropriate target for the treatment of patients with NSCLC harboring ALK gene 
rearrangements as demonstrated in nonclinical NSCLC models and in clinical trials with crizotinib and 
ceritinib, both of which have received marketing authorization in ALK-positive NSCLC in the EU in 2012 and 
2015, respectively. 
Crizotinib, an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including ALK, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR or 
hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-Met]), recepteur d’origine nantais (RON) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 
(ROS1), was the first approved TKI for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. In the EU, crizotinib received 
conditional approval for patients with previously treated, ALK-positive, advanced NSCLC (Xalkori SmPC).

About the product 
Alectinib is a highly selective and potent ALK and RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies, 
inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity led to blockage of downstream signalling pathways including STAT 3 
and PI3K/AKT and induction of tumour cell death (apoptosis). 
Alectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including 
mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib. The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) has shown similar in 
vitro potency and activity. 
Treatment with Alectinib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
A validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients. ALK-positive NSCLC 
status should be established prior to initiation of Alectinib therapy.  
The recommended dose of Alectinib is 600 mg (four 150 mg capsules) taken twice daily with food (total daily 
dose of 1200 mg).  
Treatment with Alectinib should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
If a planned dose of Alectinib is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 
6 hours.  Patients should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. If vomiting 
occurs after taking a dose of Alectinib, patients should take the next dose at the scheduled time. 
Management of adverse events may require dose reduction, temporary interruption, or discontinuation of 
treatment with Alectinib. The dose of Alectinib should be reduced in steps of 150 mg twice daily based on 
tolerability. Alectinib treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate the 
300 mg twice daily dose.  
Dose modification advice is provided in Tables 1 and 2 below.

formula C30H35ClN4O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 519.08 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of alectinib hydrochloride. 
The active substance is an achiral molecule. Its molecular structure has been confirmed by elemental 
analysis, IR, NMR (1H and 13C) and UV spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. 
Alectinib HCl is a white to yellow white powder or powder with lumps. The pKa value is 7.05 for the free base 
form. It is slightly hygroscopic and has low solubility in aqueous buffers across the pH range. Therefore 
particle size is a critical material attribute and it is controlled in the active substance specification. The higher 
solubility observed in fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) than in fasted state simulated intestinal 
fluid (FaSSIF), suggests a potential food effect (see clinical section). 
Alectinib HCl exhibits polymorphism. Multiple crystalline solid forms were identified in screening studies. An 
amorphous form of alectinib HCl was also observed. The forms have been studied by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), X-ray single crystal 
diffraction (XRSCD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Alectinib HCl Form I has been confirmed to be the 
thermodynamically stable solid form under ambient conditions and was the form selected for development 
and commercial use. Form I is consistently produced by the proposed commercial manufacturing process and 
does not change upon storage. Although formation of an amorphous fraction can occur during milling of 
alectinib HCl, it is controlled to acceptable levels by the milling process (see manufacture section).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Alectinib HCl active substance is manufactured through a six-step synthesis from four starting materials 
which are controlled by acceptable specifications. This is followed by a seventh process step in which the 
active substance is milled to achieve desired particle size distribution.   
The process has been described in detail (e.g. details of order of charging, amounts of ingredients, agitation, 
temperatures and in-process controls). Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and observed impurities (including related substances, 
genotoxic compounds, reagents, solvents and elemental impurities) have been discussed for each step of the 
Assessment report

synthesis in relation to their origin, occurrence, possible fate products and purging capacity of the 
manufacturing process. All introduced materials for the manufacture of alectinib as well as compounds 
formed and having the possibility to be formed during manufacture or during storage, have been screened for 
genotoxicity structures using in silico evaluation of structures (using two complementary (Q)SAR 
mutagenicity prediction methods (DEREK and MultiCase)), chemical reasoning, and analytical testing. These 
include the starting materials and their impurities (observed and potential), reagents, solvents, process 
intermediates, potential degradation products, and reasonably expected reaction by-products involved in the 
synthesis of alectinib HCl. Several compounds were identified as genotoxic or potentially genotoxic. The 
potential for carry-over of these impurities was evaluated. It was demonstrated that the highest carry-over 
level is well below the ICH M7 LTL limit (LT 1-10 years) for individual mutagenic impurities. Batch analyses 
for the key impurities corroborating the efficient purge of these impurities in the manufacturing process have 
been presented. In addition, during commercial manufacture, each key impurity is controlled with an 
acceptable specification. Overall, the carry-over and purging studies performed have led to an acceptable 
control strategy for these compounds.  
Risk assessments were performed to determine the impact of material and process inputs. These were 
followed by an FMEA (Failure Mode Effect Analysis) exercise to determine critical process parameters (CPPs) 
and a final risk assessment to summarize quality attribute/process parameter functional relationships and 
finalize the specifications for starting materials and isolated intermediates. The specifications for all materials 
used during the manufacturing process have been provided and are considered satisfactory. Critical material 
attributes and CPPs have been identified and are included in the control strategy. Rationales supporting the 
commercial process and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) (with indication of targets) have been described 
and justified based in development results. 
As mentioned above, Form I is consistently produced by the commercial manufacturing process.  Formation 
of an amorphous fraction can occur during milling of alectinib HCl (Form I).  The particle size distribution and 
the amorphous content in the milled alectinib HCl are controlled by the milling process. It has been 
demonstrated that the amorphous content is adequately controlled when the process is operated within the 
established PARs. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data 
from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.  
The amorphous content, at levels formed during the milling process, was demonstrated to have no 
impact on in vitro dissolution. 
The polymorphic form of alectinib HCl is qualitatively confirmed at release by the XRPD identity 
test included in the active substance specification. Stability studies also confirmed that Form I is 
chemically stable when stored under accelerated and long term conditions (see stability section).  
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE-bag in a heat sealed 
aluminium bag which complies with the EC directive EC 10/2011 as amended 
and Ph. Eur. 3.1.4.Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (colour, appearance-visual), identification 
(IR, XRPD, IC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), hydrogen chloride (IC), water content (KF), 
residual solvents (HS GC-MS, IC), residue on ignition (Ph Eur), particle size distribution (LD), microbial 
quality (Ph Eur). 
The specification has been established based on recommendations in ICH Q3A (R2), Q3C (R5), Q3D, Q6A, 
and M7; consideration of analytical data from development and commercial (for Japanese market) batches of 
alectinib HCl; and stability data for the primary batches. The acceptance criteria, as well as the rationale for 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 15/122 
  
  
 
inclusion or exclusion of individual tests have been provided in the dossier and are considered acceptable. 
The levels of residual solvents are set in accordance with ICH Q3C. A fluorinated solvent used in the 
manufacturing process is not ICH classified. The specification limit established for this solvent was derived 
from toxicological studies based on an acceptable daily exposure (ADE) of 50 g using published data from 
the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) database.  
The specification for the particle size distribution (PSD) of alectinib HCl was based on representative batches 
of milled drug substance, knowledge of the relationship between PSD of the drug substance and in vitro 
dissolution performance of the finished product, stability results for the PSD, and manufacturing 
considerations. 
A justification for not including amorphous content in the active substance specification was provided and was 
accepted. 
The omission of elemental impurities in the active substance specification was justified in line with ICH 
Q3D.The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 21 pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured by the 
intended manufacturers according to the commercial synthetic route has been provided. These batches were 
used for development, commercial (for Japanese market), primary stability, clinical and toxicology studies. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored 
in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 12 months under long term 
conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Supportive stability data from one commercial scale batch stored for 24 
months at 25°C / 60%RH and for 6 months at 40°C / 75%RH was also provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (XRPD), related substances, assay, 
hydrogen chloride, water content, ethyl chloride, PSD and microbial quality. The batches have been analysed 
with the same methods as those proposed for release testing, except for XRPD and PSD testing for which 
older methods were used. 
The long term and accelerated data provided confirms the stability of the drug substance at the studied 
conditions. Apart for a yellowing of the powder with time, no significant changes were seen for any 
parameter. All samples remained within the proposed acceptance criteria when stored at both long term and 
accelerated conditions.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Samples were tested for 
appearance, identification (XRPD), related substances, water content and assay. The photostability sample 
showed an increase in degradation products with a decrease in the assay. Yellowing was observed in the 
exposed sample. Other tests (XRPD and water content) did not show any significant change. Therefore it was 
concluded that the active substance should be protected from light by its container closure system.  
Samples were also exposed to stress conditions (elevated temperature, elevated temperature and humidity, 
acidic and basic conditions, and oxidative conditions) Several degradation products were observed. The

The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The proposed commercial formulation is an immediate release hard capsule for oral administration containing 
150 mg of alectinib (as hydrochloride) and standard excipients. The capsules are size 1, white, with “ALE” 
printed in black ink on the cap and “150 mg” printed in black ink on the body. They are packaged in 
aluminium/aluminium perforated blisters. The composition of the capsules is presented in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in chapter 2.2.1 of this report.  
Different formulations were used during clinical studies. Two dosage strengths, 20 mg and 40 mg, were 
initially developed for first-in-human study. Since a dose of 600 mg twice a day was clinically required, a 
higher strength capsule for Phase II and Phase III studies was developed to reduce the number of capsules 
needed to achieve higher doses and increase patient compliance and convenience. This resulted in a 150 mg 
capsule formulation which was designed to match the dissolution characteristics of the initial 40 mg capsule. 
Comparable release characteristics of the 40 mg capsule and the proposed 150 mg formulation was 
demonstrated by the in vitro dissolution studies. The proposed 150 mg formulation was used in the Phase 
I/II studies NP28673 (global) and NP28761 (US and Canada), and the ongoing global Phase III study 
BO28984.  
The development of the product followed a classic development approach and adopted elements of Quality by 
Design (QbD) and risk-based methodology. 
As described above, alectinib is a poorly water soluble free base with a measured pKa of 7.05. The mono HCl 
salt (Form I) was selected for development based on higher solubility in comparison to other salts and 
maximum absorbable dose.  To enhance dissolution performance, the active substance is milled and the 
particle size distribution is controlled.  Form I is the only solid form used in non-clinical (toxicological) and 
clinical studies conducted throughout development. Form I is consistently produced by the commercial drug 
substance manufacturing process. A small amount of amorphous content has been observed in the milled 
drug substance, which was shown to have a negligible impact on clinical bioavailability. The amount of 
amorphous content is controlled by the milling process parameters to acceptable levels. 
The excipients examined during formulation development were selected based on prior use in approved 
products manufactured by wet granulation and the physicochemical properties of the active substance. These 
were evaluated regarding compatibility. The results indicated that alectinib HCl was compatible with all of the 
excipients tested. 
Potential excipients were also screened for their suitability to increase the active substance solubility and 
possibly in vivo exposure for alectinib HCl. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) showed significantly higher solubility 
enhancement compared to the other excipients and was selected as wetting agent. Based on early in vitro 
dissolution studies the level of SLS in the dosage form was selected for clinical formulations. This results in a 
total daily intake of 600 mg of SLS at the efficacious dose of alectinib (600 mg twice a day [BID]), which is 
higher than the amount included in medicinal products approved within the EU. The safety concerns 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 17/122 
  
  
 
regarding the proposed high amount of SLS were discussed with the applicant as part of a scientific advice 
procedure (see non-clinical section). The applicant was advised to reduce the amount of SLS in the 
formulation proposed for marketing. In order to explore the possibility of alternate formulations with lower 
SLS content, the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study (NP29040) to compare the clinical formulation 
proposed for commercial use (alectinib hard capsules, 150 mg with 50% SLS) and three lower SLS 
formulations (see clinical section).  In order to reduce the intake of SLS, the applicant has been 
recommended to introduce an alternative capsule formulation for oral administration containing a lower 
amount of SLS post-approval. 
From the polymers investigated the binder hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was selected Lactose monohydrate 
is added as a water-soluble diluent. Carboxymethylcellulose calcium was selected as disintegrant. Magnesium 
stearate is used as a lubricant at a level typical in solid dosage formulations. The list of excipients included in 
the commercial formulation is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated with regard to different critical 
material attributes, CPPs and the effect of stressed storage conditions.  
The manufacturing process involves conventional pharmaceutical operations: sieving and blending of drug 
substance and internal phase excipients, high-shear wet granulation, wet sieving, fluid-bed drying, dry 
sieving, blending of the dried granules and external phase excipients and encapsulation. Early process 
development was based on informal risk assessments to identify potential CPPs and potential CMAs, which 
served to guide subsequent experimental studies. As mentioned above, the active substance particle size 
distribution was found to have a strong effect on dissolution and therefore it is controlled by a milling process 
and a specification was established to ensure a satisfactory dissolution performance. With regards to the 
process parameters, the higher-shear wet granulation step is the most critical process steps that impacts 
product quality and manufacturability.  
The primary packaging is aluminium/aluminium perforated blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  finished  product  is  manufactured  using  conventional  pharmaceutical  wet  granulation  and  drying 
processes.  Specifically,  the  manufacturing  process  consists  of  nine  main  steps:  sieving,  blending,  wet 
granulation,  wet  sieving,  drying,  dry  sieving,  blending,  encapsulation  and  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing  process.  Optimisation  of  the  manufacturing  process  was 
performed based on experience gained from risk assessments and DOE studies. 
The in-process controls, frequency of testing, and acceptance criteria for the capsules are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process. 
Six process evaluation batches were manufactured to confirm the proposed control strategy and to 
demonstrate the reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process. These batches were 
manufactured at commercial production scale at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. Three 
registration batches were manufactured during process development prior to the manufacture of the process 
evaluation batches, also at full commercial scale, for stability evaluation and batch analyses. It has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 18/122 
  
  
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The specifications for the drug product at release and shelf-life has been established based on ICH Q3B (R2), 
Q6A and M7 requirements, taking into consideration analytical data from clinical and primary stability batches 
at release and during stability studies, as well as the USP, Ph. Eur. and JP monographs for capsules. 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage 
form.  They  include:  description  (visual),  description  of  capsule  content  (visual),  identification  of  alectinib 
hydrochloride  (HPLC,  IR),  content  per  capsule  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (GC-MS,  HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage  units  (Ph  Eur),  dissolution  (HPLC),  microbial  limits  (Ph  Eur)  and  water  content  (KF).  The  finished 
product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product 
release testing. 
Although the product is formulated as an immediate-release dosage form, the active substance has low 
solubility across the entire physiological pH range (pH 2.0–6.8). Therefore a two-point dissolution 
specification has been established. The dissolution specification time points and Q values were established 
based on statistical analysis of the dissolution data of representative finished product batches at release and 
stability. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 35 batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process 
and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. These correspond to 6 pilot scale batches 
and 3 primary stability batches manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site; and 26 
development and clinical batches manufactured at an alternative site. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 
months at 30°C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are representative of those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance (description of capsules and capsule content), identification of alectinib 
HCl (by IR), content per capsule of alectinib HCl (by HPLC), degradation products, dissolution, microbial limits 
and water content according to the specification presented above. 
All parameters remained within specification during the stability testing at all storage conditions. No 
significant changes were observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as per the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. Results demonstrated that the finished product is not light sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with the storage instructions “store in the 
original package in order to protect from moisture” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
Apart from lactose monohydrate, no other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The active substance has low aqueous solubility across the pH range. 
Therefore, suitable specifications for particle size distribution of the drug substance and in vitro dissolution 
have been established to ensure drug product performance. Alectinib HCl Form I is consistently produced by 
the proposed commercial manufacturing process. Although formation of an amorphous fraction can occur 
during milling of alectinib HCl (Form I), the level of amorphous content is suitably controlled by the milling 
process parameters to ensure dissolution performance. 
In order to increase the solubility of alectinib HCl, the anionic surfactant SLS is used as a wetting agent in the 
formulation. The recommended daily dose of Alecensa is 1200 mg (4 capsules twice a day). This results in a 
daily intake of SLS of 600 mg, which is higher than approved medicines in the EU. Although at present the 
benefit/risk is positive, the applicant is recommended to introduce an alternative formulation containing a 
lower amount of SLS post-approval. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to introduce an alternative capsule formulation for oral administration 
containing a lower amount of SLS post-approval.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In an enzyme assay, alectinib inhibited ALK with an IC50 of 1.9 nM. In addition RET is inhibited with an IC50 of 
4.8 nM. No kinase inhibitory effect was seen with a large panel of other tyrosine kinases. This is in contrast to 
other ALK inhibitors like crizotinib and ceritinib which show relevant activity at several unrelated kinases.

The antiproliferative effect of alectinib was investigated in a number of cell lines, including NSCLC, 
lymphoma, and neuroblastoma cell lines. These experiments included cell lines with wild-type ALK, ALK 
fusion proteins, ALK amplification, ALK mutation, and ALK deletion.

Cells were seeded and cultured overnight, and then treated with alectinib for four or five days. Cell growth was measured using the WST-8 
or CellTiter-Glo  assays, and the IC50 values were calculated. 
Alectinib also showed activity against ALK point mutations associated with acquired crizotinib resistance. The 
IC50 for these kinases varied between 2-fold lower to 20-fold higher than for native ALK. Alectinib inhibited 
the growth of tumor cell lines where ALK activation is due to the formation of a fusion protein (EML4-ALK). A 
comparison of the in vitro anti-tumor activity between alectinib and crizotinb was performed with number of 
murine Ba/F3-derived cell lines expressing different EML4-ALK mutants (see the following figure and table). 
Ba/F3 parental cell line and Ba/F3 cell lines expressing native or mutated EML4-ALK 
were treated with alectinib (CH5424802) (A) or crizotinib (B) for 2 days. Cell viability was analyzed by CellTiter-Glo® 
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Data are shown as mean  ±  SD (n = 3).

A comparison of the inhibitory activity of alectinib vs crizotinib for unmutated and mutated ALK was 
conducted in vitro (Study 1061439). The following table shows the IC50 values for the decrease in cell 
viability. In this table are also shown the ratios where the IC50 value with the mutant ALK is divided with the 
IC50 value for the WT ALK – thus representing how much each mutant affects the activity of the two ALK 
inhibitors.

In a further set of studies, crizotinib-resistant EML4-ALK mutants, expressed in the murine Ba/F3 cell line 
were implanted subcutaneously in mice, and the anti-tumor effect of alectinib and crizotinib was studied. 
Alectinib at 60 mg/kg inhibited the growth of many of these mutants, where crizotinib at 100 mg/kg was 
without effect.

NCI-H2228 cells were injected intracranially into mice at 4 x 105 cells/mouse. Starting 20 days after implantation, mice 
were treated with control vehicle (closed circle), alectinib (60 mg/kg/day, free base; open square), or crizotinib (100 
mg/kg/day; open triangle) once daily from Day 20 to 45 or until death.

Implantation Model 
In a second model using tumour cells expressing the luciferase gene and bioluminescence as readout, 
Alectinib showed anti-tumor activity in the brain against these tumors, while crizotinib did not.  
The main human metabolite, M4 was determined to have an IC50 of 1.2 nM against human recombinant ALK, 
equivalent to that of alectinib (IC50 of 1.9 nM). Moreover, M4 was also tested in enzyme assays against ALK 
mutations associated with crizotinib resistance, and found to have similar inhibition to the parental molecule, 
alectinib. The kinase selectivity of M4 was also explored in an enzyme assay against various protein kinases, 
and found to be very similar to alectinib. The growth inhibiting activity of M4 was also evaluated using EML4-
ALK fusion-positive cell line NCI-H2228. M4 inhibited growth of the NCI-H2228 cell line with an IC50 of 37 
nM, which is in the same range as that for alectinib (IC50 of 12 nM).. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro screening assays investigated the effects of a single concentration of alectinib (10 μM, 4826 ng/mL) 
on ligand binding to 109 types of receptors, ion channels and transporters, and on the activity of 42 types of 
enzymes. The results of these assays showed that at concentrations far exceeding the clinically relevant free 
exposure (by ~690 fold), alectinib had an inhibitory effect of  >50% on ligand binding (peripheral 
benzodiazepine receptors, dopamine receptors, muscarinic receptors, neurokinin receptors, serotonin 
receptors, sigma [σ] receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, urotensin receptors, L-type Ca2+  channels, Cl - 
channels, serotonin transporters, norepinephrine transporters, dopamine transporters) and enzyme activity 
(CaMK2α).  
Functional assays were then performed on the basis of the outcomes of these binding assays. The functions 
of 20 receptors expressed in cells and the synaptosomal uptake of 2 types of monoamines (norepinephrine 
and dopamine) in rats were evaluated at 2 concentrations (1 and 10 μM, 482.6 and 4826 ng/mL). The 
receptors evaluated included those with ligand binding inhibited by alectinib, namely dopamine, muscarine, 
neurokinin, serotonin, and urotensin receptors that could be tested with functional assays. > 50% inhibition 
of synaptosomal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine occurred at a concentration of 1 μM (53% and 83%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 24/122 
  
  
 
respectively). At 10 μM, % inhibition of uptake was 49% for dopamine and 43% for norepinephrine. For 
serotonin, >50% inhibition of serotonin receptor 5-HT2B activity was observed at 10 μM (82%). No other 
receptor functions were affected. 
To further investigate the inhibitory action seen in these functional assays, inhibition of synaptosomal uptake 
of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine was examined at concentrations of 10-3 to 1 μM. The IC50s of 
serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine uptake were determined to be 0.10, 0.33, and 0.26 μM (48.3, 
159.3, and 125.5 ng/mL), respectively, which corresponds to 7- to 22-fold the human relevant free exposure 
of approximately 7 ng/mL. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular 
Alectinib blocked hERG currents with an IC20 of 0.12 μM (58 ng/mL) and an IC50 of 0.45 μM (217 ng/mL). 
These concentrations are approximately 8- to 30-fold the anticipated free clinical Cmax of ~7 ng/mL at 600 
mg BID. Alectinib has the potential to block the voltage-dependent Cav1.2 channel with an IC20 of 0.203 μM 
(98 ng/mL) and an IC50 of 0.461 μM (222 ng/mL) 
An exploratory cardiovascular safety pharmacology study was performed in monkeys. At 20 and 60 mg/kg 
(group mean Cmax on first dosing day: 719 and 695 ng/mL, respectively; data taken from Day 1 of the 2-
week repeat-dose monkey study), a slight hypotensive effect (approximately -10 mm Hg) was seen, but 
there were no effects on the ECG or heart rate. The hypotension occurring after the 20 mg/kg dose resolved 
approximately 22 hours after dosing, whereas after the 60 mg/kg dose, it persisted at least until the end of 
the recording period (24 hours), showing dose dependence mainly in duration of effect. 
A GLP cardiovascular study was performed in monkeys with ascending doses of 1.7, 5, and 15 mg/kg 
alectinib. No effects on the cardiovascular system or body temperature were seen at any dose up to 
15 mg/kg (4-hour postdose mean plasma drug concentration: 279 ng/mL). Based on these findings, the 
NOEL for the hypotension seen in the exploratory telemetry study was deemed to be 15 mg/kg. 
To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the alectinib-induced hypotension seen in the exploratory study 
of telemetered monkeys, the effects of alectinib (free base) on vasoconstriction of isolated rat aorta induced 
by a high-concentration potassium solution were evaluated using Magnus' method. Alectinib inhibited the 
vasoconstriction induced by the high-concentration potassium solution with an IC20 of 0.0153 μM (7.38 
ng/mL, reaching the free clinical exposure range and the free concentration in the exploratory telemetry 
study) and an IC50 of 0.168 μM (81.1 ng/mL). This vasodilatory effect was considered the cause of the 
hypotension seen in cynomolgus monkeys 
CNS 
To investigate the effects of alectinib on the CNS, a single dose of the vehicle (10% w/v HPCD, 0.01 M MSA, 
and 0.001 M HCL solution) or 3, 30, or 300 mg/kg alectinib was orally administered to male rats (N = 6 in 
each group), and behavior and general condition were observed using the modified Irwin test. A separate 
pharmacokinetic group consisting of 3 male rats was used to confirm exposure. No effects on the CNS were 
seen at any of the doses up to 300 mg/kg (mean Cmax: 1770 ng/mL). 
Respiratory 
To investigate the effects of alectinib on the respiratory system, a single dose of the vehicle (10% w/v HPCD, 
0.01 M MSA, and 0.001 M HCL solution) or 3, 30, or 300 mg/kg alectinib was orally administered to conscious 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 25/122 
  
  
male rats (N = 8 in each group), and respiratory rate and ventilation volume (tidal volume and minute 
volume) were measured (whole-body plethysmography). No effects on the respiratory system were seen at 
any of the doses up to 300 mg/kg (for comparison, mean Cmax at 300 mg/kg in the modified Irwin's test 
is 1770 ng/mL). 
Gastrointestinal 
The potential effect of alectinib on gastrointestinal motor function was investigated in male rats using a 
phenol red method. Alectinib was orally administered as a single dose to 6 animals per group at 0, 3, 30 and 
300 mg/kg (vehicle: 10% w/v HPCD, 0.01 M MSA and 0.001 M HCL solution). Gastric emptying and small 
intestinal transit of phenol red, which was orally administrated by gavage 4 hours after test article 
administration, were evaluated.  No test article-related effects on gastrointestinal motor function were 
observed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The measurement of plasma concentrations of alectinib in rats, rabbit, and monkeys was validated using a 
liquid chromatography — tandem mass spectrometry (LC - MS/MS) method with a supernatant obtained after 
plasma protein precipitation.  
The measurement of plasma concentrations of the metabolite M4 in monkeys was validated using LC -
 MS/MS after plasma protein precipitation. 
Absorption 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats and monkeys with intravenous and oral 
administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in the following tables:

The tissue distribution studies following a single oral dose of [14C]-alectinib to albino, pigmented and 
pregnant rats demonstrated that drug-related material: 
1) distributed well to all tissues with highest tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios in harderian glands, 
adrenal glands, lungs, brown adipose tissue and liver; 
2) penetrated into the CNS tissues with brain tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of approximately 1; 
3) had high accumulation in the melanin-containing tissue uveal tract of the eyes; 
4) penetrated the foetus with a distribution pattern to that in maternal rats 
In vitro plasma protein binding 
The plasma protein binding ratios (fb) of [14C]-alectinib at concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10,000 ng/mL 
(1000 ng/mL in mice) were all high,  > 99%, regardless of species or concentration.  The [14C]-alectinib–HSA 
binding ratio at concentrations of 100, 300, and 1000 ng/mL was 97%, but the ratio of binding to α1–AAG 
was low, ≤ 4.9%, at all concentrations. These findings suggest that albumin is the main binding protein in 
human plasma. M4 was highly protein bound, like the parent molecule, with fb>99% in all species and 
concentrations tested. 
In vitro blood cell distribution 
At concentrations of 100 to 1000 ng/mL, the blood/plasma concentration ratio (Rb) values of rats (2.06), 
cynomolgus monkeys (3.95 - 3.52), and humans (2.92 - 2.64) were similar. At a concentration of 10,000 
ng/mL, the Rb values decreased to 1.40 in rats, 1.68 in cynomolgus monkeys, and 1.29 in humans.  
The blood cell distribution of M4 in rat, monkey, and human blood was evaluated in vitro at concentrations of 
0.3, 1 and 2 µg/mL.  The quantification of M4 was determined by a LC - MS/MS-based method.  The Rb 
values were 2.70 - 2.45 in rats, 2.26 - 2.18 in monkeys, and 2.58 - 2.50 in humans. 
Metabolism 
The metabolic pathway of alectinib in humans is proposed based on the results of in vitro metabolism studies 
using human hepatocytes, human liver microsomes, microsomes expressing human CYP isoforms (Figure 1) 
and the results from the radiolabelled human ADME study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017

Figure 1: Proposed Metabolic Pathway for Alectinib in Humans 
The enzymes involved in the metabolism of alectinib in human hepatocytes were evaluated by reacting [14C]-
alectinib (2 µM) with a human hepatocyte suspension (prepared from cryopreserved hepatocytes) for 60 
minutes at 37˚C in the presence of benzylimidazole or ketoconazole. This study suggests that CYP3A is the 
primary enzyme responsible formation of M4 and M6 and contributes to 40% - 50% of total hepatic 
metabolism. 
M4 and M6 exposure levels were measured in cryopreserved plasma samples from the 13-week oral repeat-
dose toxicity study of alectinib in rats from the high dose group (27 mg/kg/day) using a qualified LC -
 MS/MS-based method. Exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24) on Days 1 and 91 are shown in In rats, the exposure to 
M4 and M6 was higher in male rats, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 times the levels in females. There was no 
pronounced increase in plasma trough level from the Day 28 onward, and Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 91 
were 1.7 - 2.0 times higher (M4) and 1.1 - 1.7 times higher (M6) than on Day 1.  M6 had much lower 
exposure than M4 (6% - 11% of M4) and is considered a minor/trace metabolite. Based on the mean AUC0-24 
(35,300 and 41,100 ng∙h/mL in male and females, respectively) of alectinib on Day 91, the M4-to-parent 
AUC ratios were 3 - 5%. 
In monkeys, there were no clear sex differences in exposure to metabolites M4 or M6. There was no 
pronounced increase in plasma trough level from Day 28 dose onward, and Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 91 were 
1.9  to 2.4 times higher (M4) and 2.1 to 3.7 times higher (M6) than on Day 1.  M6 had much lower exposure 
than M4 (6% to 10% of M4) and is considered a minor/trace metabolite.  Based on the mean AUC0-24 (6990 
ng∙h/mL, gender combined) of alectinib on Day 91, the M4-to-parent AUC ratios were 24%. 
Excretion 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017

The excretion of radioactivity in urine and faeces was evaluated up to 168 hours after a single oral dose of 1 
mg/kg [14C]-alectinib in male RccHan™: WIST rats. 
The main route of excretion for drug-related substances was via faeces, and cumulative faecal excretion at 
24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose was 51.9%, 78.5%, 87.2%, 91.3%, and 95.7% of the dose, 
respectively. Excretion in urine was minimal and nearly complete within 96 hours of dosing. The total amount 
of radioactivity excreted in urine by 168 hours postdose was 0.5% of the dose. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The performed studies include repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, preliminary embryo-foetal development 
toxicity, phototoxicity and toxicity evaluation of the clinical formulation in rats. In addition, the major human 
metabolite M4 was investigated in genotoxicity studies in vitro. The rat and cynomolgus monkey were the 
selected rodent and non-rodent species, respectively, for general toxicity studies based on their suitable 
pharmacokinetic profiles and representation of the major metabolism pathways in humans.

micronucleus test study in rats and on the basis of general condition the day after the first dose in the 
preliminary 2-week toxicity study in monkeys. There were no deaths or deteriorations in general condition at 
≤ 2000 mg/kg/day in rats or at ≤ 60 mg/kg/day in monkeys. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity of alectinib after oral administration was investigated in studies up to 13 weeks in 
rats and monkeys.  Identified target organs in both rats and monkeys were the erythroid system, GI tract, 
hepatobiliary system and adrenal cortex. In rats only, additional effects were observed in the respiratory 
tract, bone, incisor teeth, and prolongation of clotting time accompanied by haemorrhagic changes in the 
ileum. The changes seen in the 4- and 13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies had recovered or had shown a 
tendency to recover by the end of the respective 4- and 8-week recovery periods.  
Morbidity and mortality 
In the preliminary 2-week toxicity study conducted in monkeys, one of two animals in the high dose group 
was sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 13. The major cause of the moribund condition was thought to 
be GI tract abnormalities including retention of digestive tract contents and digestive tract dilatation. 
Therefore, the dose limiting toxicity at 60 mg/kg (AUC0-24 on Day 1, gender combined: 12050 ng·h/mL) in 
monkeys was attributed to alectinib’s effect on the GI tract. No deaths or deteriorations in condition due to 
toxicity were seen in either species in the 4- and 13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Effects on the erythroid system (rats and monkeys) 
Abnormal red blood cell (RBC) morphology (poikilocytosis, i.e., mainly burr cells and fragmented 
erythrocytes) was one of the changes seen at a low exposures.  In most cases, abnormal RBC morphology 
was seen at low dose, and then as the exposure level increased, a tendency to slight anaemia was seen in 
monkeys.  In rats, changes suggestive of a compensatory response to anaemic stimuli (e.g., increased 
reticulocytes, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and mild increase in spleen weight) were 
seen.  In the 13-week study in rats, in contrast to monkeys, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the 
spleen was seen at all doses, while abnormal RBC morphology was only seen at higher exposure levels.  The 
changes in erythroid system parameters were generally mild and no exacerbation was noted with continued 
treatment.  Similar findings were also seen in rabbits.  The findings were considered reversible or showed a 
trend towards reversibility after the recovery period.  
Effects on the gastrointestinal tract (rats and monkeys) 
Effects on GI epithelia (proliferative zone extension in GI mucosa) were seen in both species. In addition, in 
rats, degeneration and mucinous hypertrophy of glandular stomach mucosal epithelium, mixed cell infiltration 
in mucosa, disarrangement/desquamation of mucosal epithelium in the small intestine, and increased serum 
intestinal ALP were noted. The multinucleated giant cells seen in the GI mucosa were similar to macrophages 
phagocytizing foreign material. The content in these cells was most likely the test article dosing formulation 
(suspension). In monkeys, dilatation of the large intestine was also seen, and, in the preliminary 2-week 
study, decreased stool and retention of GI contents were seen in both animals at 60 mg/kg/day and were 
accompanied by very slight erosions/ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, caecum and colon at histopathology. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 30/122 
  
  
 
 
One animal in that group was sacrificed moribund due to worsening of GI symptoms. In rats, no exacerbation 
of GI changes was seen after 13 weeks treatment when compared to the 4-week study.  
Effects on the hepatobiliary system (rats and monkeys) 
In rats, increases in liver weight were noted with vacuolation and degeneration/necrosis of bile ductal 
epithelium, bile duct proliferation, hepatocellular hypertrophy and necrosis, and, hepatic sinusoidal 
swelling/yellow-brown pigmentation. The hepatobiliary changes were associated with increases in serum 
hepatic ALP, -GT and total cholesterol. The changes were mostly minimal to mild; the only moderate change 
was focal hepatocellular necrosis. In monkeys, increases in serum hepatic ALP, direct bilirubin, inflammatory 
cell infiltration in Glisson’s sheath, hypertrophy of hepatocytes or Kupffer cells, and increases in liver weight 
were seen in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. In addition, bile duct proliferation and increased serum 
-GT were seen in the 13-week study. The histopathological changes were minimal, and the changes in 
laboratory values were mild.  Hepatocellular hypertrophy was also observed in the 2-week preliminary study 
at 20 mg/kg/day accompanied by very slight bile duct proliferation in one animal. Extension of the dosing 
period from 4 to 13 weeks did not lead to a marked increase in the severity of hepatobiliary findings, but 
findings occurred at lower exposure.  The findings showed complete reversibility during the recovery period. 
Effects on the adrenal gland (rats and monkeys) 
In rats, findings included increased adrenal gland weight and cortical hypertrophy (zona fascicularis and 
reticularis) and increased large lipid droplets or decreased lipid droplets in fascicular cells. In monkeys, 
cortical hypertrophy of zona fascicularis/reticularis with decreased lipid droplets in fascicular cells was seen. 
The histopathological findings were of minimal to mild severity and were reversible. Many of these 
histopathological changes are similar to those usually induced by stress. Accordingly, slight increases of blood 
glucose, cholesterol, neutrophils and decreases in lymphocytes (rat 4-week repeat-dose study) might have 
been responses to adrenal cortical hypertrophy.   
Effects on the respiratory system (lung and trachea, rats) 
Minimal to mild foamy macrophage infiltration in alveoli was seen in the 4- and 13-week repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats. There was no clear exacerbation with longer treatment at comparable exposures, but an 
increased severity and incidence at higher doses compared to the control groups. Additionally, mixed cellular 
infiltration was seen in the tracheal mucosa (macrophages/multinucleated giant cells and/or inflammatory 
cells); and in some animals in the 13-week study in rats, minimal or mild disarrangement in tracheal mucosal 
epithelium was also seen.     
Effects on bone (rats) 
Minimal or mild changes in bone were seen in the high dose groups of the 4- and 13-week repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats (group mean AUCs ≥38000 ng·h/mL) and these changes were reversible. Findings 
included increases in activated osteoclasts and decreased trabecular bone in femur and sternum associated 
with mild elevations of bone ALP and inorganic phosphorus. The exposure levels in the high dose groups in 
the 4- and 13-week studies were approximately the same, but the longer dosing period led to an increased 
severity and incidence of histopathological changes.  
Effects on teeth (rats) 
In rats, effects on incisor teeth were seen in the high dose group (27 mg/kg/day; mean AUC0-24, gender 
combined: 38200 ng·h/mL) following 13-weeks treatment. The changes were reversible following the 8-week 
recovery period. Findings included white discoloration and shortening of incisor teeth, as well as 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 31/122 
  
  
disarrangement, degeneration, and/or necrosis of ameloblasts, and dilatation of capillaries in the 
papillary/odontoblast layers, and disarrangement of odontoblasts. These changes were seen mainly in the 
middle region of the incisor, which is where enamel is produced.  
Prolongation of clotting time and ileal hemorrhage (rats) 
Prolongation of clotting time (PT and APTT) and ileal hemorrhage were seen at 27 mg/kg/day in the 13-week 
repeat-dose toxicity study in rats (group mean AUC; 38200 ng·h/mL) and were considered reversible. The 
ileal haemorrhage is considered likely secondary to the prolonged clotting time. Other potential consequences 
included blackish feces, dark-red/gelatinous content in the large intestine, and blood loss anemia (decreased 
RBC parameters, discoloration of eyeballs considered due to anemia).   
Other findings (rats) 
Mild effects on the thrombopoietic system, pituitary gland, and blood glucose were seen in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats but are considered of limited toxicological significance. 
Genotoxicity 
Alectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but induced a slight 
increase in numerical aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetic assay using Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) cells 
with metabolic activation, and micronuclei in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test. The mechanism of 
micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity), and not a clastogenic effect 
on chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies with alectinib have been conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies were not conducted with alectinib.  
Preliminary embryo-foetal developmental studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, maternal 
toxicity was evident at ≥9 mg/kg/day as shown by decreased body weight gain or body weight and 
decreased food consumption. As for the reproductive function of dams, increases in embryonic death ratio, 
early foetal death ratio and total death ratio were observed resulting in a total litter loss in all dams at 27 
mg/kg/day. In foetal examination, decreased foetal weight, decrease in the number of sacral and caudal 
vertebrae, and increases in visceral anomalies ratio, including dilation of ureter, thymic cord, small heart 
ventricle and thinning of ventricular wall, were observed at 9 mg/kg/day. The findings in heart were seen at a 
low incidence, in 2 foetuses from 1 dam. Due to the total litter loss at the highest dose, a potential dose-
response relationship may be masked by the lethality and cannot be evaluated. Based on the absence of 
similar observations in the control and low dose groups, a relation to treatment cannot be excluded. In 
conclusion, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity in rats was 3 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24h 
13900 ng∙h/mL on GD17). 
In rabbits, maternal toxicity was observed at 27 mg/kg/day including low food consumption and body weight, 
and changes considered to be associated with anaemic changes, deterioration of nutritional condition, 
inflammation and/or stress in haematology and blood chemistry. In addition, erythrocyte morphological

abnormalities, in which were based mainly on poikilocyte (burr cell) were observed at ≥9 mg/kg/day. At 
27 mg/kg/day, one dam aborted and two others had total litter loss. Increased post-implantation loss, 
reduced foetal and placental weights, reduced litter size and an increased incidence of foetuses with 
additional ribs were also noted in the dams given 27 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits 
was 3 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24h, 2950 ng∙h/mL on GD18), and 9 mg/kg/day for embryo-foetal development. 
No studies on pre-and post-natal development have been performed 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic (TK) assessment was included in all toxicology studies conducted in rats, monkeys and rabbits. 
In addition, the exposure of metabolites M4 and M6 was measured in cryopreserved plasma samples from 
the 13-week oral repeat-dose toxicity studies using a qualified LC 
 MS/MS-based method. Plasma samples 
from the high dose groups only were evaluated, i.e. 27 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day, in rats and monkeys, 
respectively.

Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were performed. The local tolerance after oral administration is 
considered adequately assessed in performed oral repeat-dose toxicology studies. Local effects in the GI tract 
were seen in both rats and monkeys and are considered dose-limiting. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Alectinib shows affinity with eyes and skin and absorbs light in the 290-700 nm range. In the 3T3 NRU assay 
in vitro, alectinib was positive suggesting a potential risk of phototoxicity.   
4-week rat study with alectinib in the SLS-containing clinical formulation 
The clinical formulation contains sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) at a concentration of 50% (w/w SLS to 
alectinib). This formulation was not used in the repeat-dose toxicity studies and therefore, a dedicated 4-
week rat study was performed to assess the tolerability of the clinical formulation and to explore potential 
toxicity effects of SLS combined with alectinib. The study showed that there were no remarkable differences 
in the alectinib toxicity and plasma concentration time profiles between alectinib in the clinical SLS 
formulation compared to alectinib in the formulation used in the toxicology studies. In the group treated with 
the clinical formulation (without alectinib but with SLS), no effects were noted. Based on the acceptable non-
clinical and clinical tolerability, the amount of SLS in the formulation is not considered to pose a significant 
toxicological concern.  
Metabolites 
Metabolite M4 was identified as a major metabolite of alectinib in humans representing ~15% of the total 
plasma radioactivity in the mass balance study. M4 was not mutagenic in the screening Ames test and nor 
was micronucleus induction observed in the in vitro micronucleus test in TK6 cells. M4 was present in both 
rats and monkeys and the AUC exposure to M4 in the 13-week repeat-dose studies represents ~33 to 59% of 
the clinical M4 exposure.  
Impurities 
The Applicants proposes to apply the less-than-lifetime (LTL) approach to determine the acceptable daily 
intakes for mutagenic impurities as described in Note 7 in the ICH M7 guideline. Based on the daily dose of 
alectinib, these intakes correspond to LTL concentration limits of 8 ppm (individual mutagenic impurities) and 
23 ppm (total of mutagenic impurities). Considering alectinib’s indication in advanced cancer and longest 
expected treatment duration based on patient life expectancy (less than 10 years), this approach is 
considered acceptable. The proposed specifications for the Class 1 compounds are considered acceptable and 
in agreement with ICH Q3C R(5) and ICH M7, respectively. For the remaining Class 2 or 3 compounds, they 
are all considered as likely below the LTL limit for individual mutagenic impurities of 8 ppm. The sum of these 
Class 2 and 3 compounds, assuming a worst-case scenario is also below the LTL limit for total mutagenic 
impurities of 23 ppm. Although it is unclear what toxicological data was used by the Applicant to calculate the 
ADI of the non-classified fluorinated solvent used during drug substance manufacture, robust data on 
genotoxicity with negative results are available in the ECHA database.

Alectinib is persistent (P) or very persistent (vP) in the environment but not bioaccumulative (not B) nor very 
bioaccumulative (not vB). It is toxic (T) due to mammalian embryotoxicity at dose levels causing maternal 
toxicity and potentially T due to chronic aquatic ecotoxicity. As all the three criteria must be fulfilled for a PBT 
substance, the conclusion is that alectinib is not a PBT substance. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In an enzyme assay, alectinib inhibits ALK with an IC50 of 1.9 nM. In addition RET is inhibited with an IC50 of 
4.8 nM. No kinase inhibitory effect was seen with a large panel of other tyrosine kinases. This is in contrast to 
other ALK inhibitors like crizotinib and ceritinib which show relevant activity at several unrelated kinases. 
Alectinib also showed activity against ALK point mutations associated with acquired crizotinib resistance. The 
IC50 for these kinases varied between 2-fold stronger to 20-fold lower than for native ALK. 
The biology of ALK and RET is discussed and it is agreed that current understanding propose a limited role of 
these kinases in the adult, whereas they may play critical roles during development; in particular for the 
neural development. For RET, there seems to be some role for neural functions also in adults. No findings 
related to the functions identified in knockout models have been observed in animal studies or in humans. 
Alectinib inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines where ALK activation is due to the formation of a fusion 
protein (EML4-ALK). In one study, alectinib was compared to crizotinib for growth inhibition. In this assay 
alectinib was about 10-fold more potent than crozitinib in inhibiting the growth of cells expressing the native 
EML4-ALK enzyme.  
When comparing the activity of alectinib and crizotinib with a series of Ba/F3 cell transfected with EML4-ALK 
as well as a number of EML4-ALK mutants there was no difference in the decrease of inhibitory activity for 
ALK mutants between alectinib and crizotinb. Thus, the ability of alectinib to show efficacy with crizotinib-
resistant tumors is not due to a qualitative difference in the inhibition of ALK and ALK mutants. An alternative 
explanation is proposed:  The activity at the parental Ba/F3 cell line, which is independent of ALK for its 
growth, represents off target activity and is likely a good surrogate for dose-limiting toxicity. For crizotinib 
the ratio between the IC50 for growth inhibition of Ba/F3 and the IC50 for the Ba/F3 EML-ALK (WT ALK 
sequence) is only 6.2 while for alectinib the corresponding figure is 48. For crizotinib, dose-limiting toxicity 
will limit the dose resulting in an exposure that will be sufficient to inhibit the growth of tumour cells 
expressing the WT ALK sequence but not most of the mutant ALK sequences. For alectinib, a higher relative 
exposure can be reached, sufficient to act at many of the mutants. For one of the mutants, ALK G12002R, 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 36/122 
  
  
alectinib actually shows a stronger loss of activity than crizotinib (13x vs 2.6x), which is well in line with the 
fact that alecctinib lacks activity on tumors harboring this mutation. 
These conclusions on the mechanistic background for the activity of alectinib in patients which have failed on 
crizotinb, while differing from the view presented by the applicant, will not have any further consequences 
from the non-clinical perspective.  
Alectinib was active in models with intrancranially injected tumors. These data, and the substantial alectinib 
exposure in CNS suggest that alectinib has the potential to be effective against brain metastases. 
The main human metabolite, M4 shows a similar or even higher activity to ALK in enzyme assays, and a 
similar selectivity. The activity in the cellular assay was somewhat lower (3-fold) which may be due to a 
lower cell penetration. This difference may be of importance for clinical PK-PD considerations, where 
substantial differences in relations between alectinib and M4 exposures have been observed (see Clinical 
section). 
In the screening for secondary pharmacology, some secondary targets with an IC50 < 1 μM were observed. 
While an in vivo activity on serotonin, norepinephrine and/or dopamine uptake cannot be fully excluded 
based on the relatively limited multiples to clinical exposure, no CNS finding were seen in the safety 
pharmacology study in rats.  
Alectinib has inhibitory activity on the hERG channel as well as on the Cav1.2 channel. At IC20 the multiple to 
the free clinical exposure is 8-fold for hERG and 14-fold for the Cav1.2 channel. In an ex-vivo aorta model, 
alectinib inhibited vasoconstriction with an IC20 value similar to the free clinical exposure. A mild hypotensive 
effect has been observed in monkeys at around clinically relevant exposures. No cardiovascular effects were 
observed in a GLP cardiovascular study in monkeys, but in this study the exposure did not reach clinical 
exposure (ca 3-fold below free clinical exposure). 
Animal data suggest a risk for cardiovascular effects (hypotension). There are no preclinical findings 
suggesting a QT liability. However, no or limited exposure multiples to clinical exposure have been obtained 
in these studies and cardiovascular effects need to be carefully addressed in the clinical setting. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of alectinib was adequately evaluated in the two toxicology species rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
The distribution studies show widespread distribution. Exposure in CNS suggests a potential for treatment of 
CNS metastases (as shown in pharmacology studies). There is retention of drug-related material in the eyes 
from pigmented animals, but not in skin. 
Drug-related material crosses the placenta and the exposure in the foetal tissues exceeded exposure in 
maternal plasma. There is a potential for direct interference with the growing foetus. 
The metabolism of alectinib was adequately evaluated in humans, rat and monkeys. 
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of alectinib has been evaluated in agreement with recommendations in ICH S9. The 
rat and cynomolgus monkey were the selected rodent and non-rodent species, respectively, for general 
toxicity studies based on their suitable pharmacokinetic profiles and representation of the major metabolism 
pathways in humans.

The repeat-dose toxicity of alectinib after oral administration was investigated in studies up to 13 weeks in 
rats and monkeys. In the repeat-dose studies in rats, the AUC exposure multiples at the highest dose levels 
compared to the clinical AUC were 2.4- to 2.8-fold, while in monkeys, the AUC exposure were less than the 
clinical exposure in all studies. 
Target organs in both rat and monkey at clinically relevant exposures in the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
included, but were not limited to the erythroid system, gastrointestinal tract, and hepatobiliary system.  
These effects were observed at exposures below that of the recommended clinical dose. However, most 
changes were minimal to mild, and changes of moderate or greater severity were only seen in rats at 
exposures approximately three times that of the recommended clinical dose. Furthermore, all findings were 
considered reversible changes that either recovered or showed a tendency to recover during the recovery 
period. It is also possible to monitor the functioning of these organs through clinical testing (haematology 
and blood chemistry tests) and clinical symptoms. 
Alectinib is a lipophilic drug, with a >1 blood-to-plasma distribution, and this may have contributed to a 
reduced membrane integrity and life span of erythrocytes.   
Abnormal erythrocyte morphology was observed at exposures equal or greater than 10-60% the human 
exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Erythrocytes are considered particularly sensitive because of 
their limited capacity to renew their cytoskeleton due to lack of a nucleus. In the proposed SmPC section 4.8, 
anaemia is included as a very common adverse reaction in clinical trials with alectinib.  
The effects on the gastrointestinal tract were considered dose-limiting in monkeys as one animal was 
sacrificed moribund due to worsening of GI symptoms. Proliferative zone extension in GI mucosa in both 
species was observed at exposures equal to or greater than 20-120% of the human AUC exposure at the 
recommended dose.  
The severity was graded as minimal to mild in all affected animals with exception of one female high dose rat 
in the 1-month study (60 mg/kg/day) which was graded as moderate. There was no apparent progression of 
the finding by extending the daily dosing period from 4 to 13 weeks. A complete recovery was noted in the 1-
month rat study and in the 1- and 3-month monkey studies while a tendency for reversibility was noted in 
the rat 3-month study. In addition to the proliferative zone extension, desquamation of surface epithelia and 
inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the 1- and 3-month rat studies but not in monkeys. In the 
preliminary 14-day monkey study, very slight erosions ulcers were noted in the stomach, duodenum, cecum 
and colon in both high dose animals (60 mg/kg/day). These findings indicate that alectinib is a slight GI 
irritant. In addition, the non-clinical vehicle also seems to have irritative properties as proliferative zone 
extension of minimal degree was observed in 18 out of 20 vehicle control rats in the 3-month rat study. 
Therefore, it is agreed with the Applicant that the observed proliferative zone extension is considered a 
secondary response to irritation. In clinical trials, the GI tolerability is considered as acceptable. Adverse GI 
effects are reported as very common and included constipation (36%), nausea (22%), diarrhoea (18%) and 
vomiting (13%). Most of these events were of mild or moderate severity and declined in frequency after the 
first month of treatment. 
Alectinib’s high liver:plasma distribution, its biliary excretion (including metabolite M4) and inhibition of BSEP 
(IC50 = 0.9 µM alectinib), may contribute to hepatobiliary toxicity. Increased hepatic alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) and direct bilirubin as well as vacuolation/degeneration/necrosis of bile duct epithelium and 
enlargement/focal necrosis of hepatocytes was observed in rats and/or monkeys at exposures equal to or 
greater than 20-30% of the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 38/122 
  
  
Adverse hepatobiliary reactions are listed as very common in the SmPC section 4.8 and adequate warnings 
are included in section 4.4. In addition, bilirubin and hepatic transaminase elevations are included as 
important identified risks in the RMP. 
The reversible effects on the adrenal glands of minimal to mild severity are similar to those usually induced 
by stress. However, as quantitative whole-body autoradiography of rats revealed a high distribution of 
radioactivity in the adrenal gland, an effect on the adrenal gland in addition to stress cannot be fully ruled 
out. 
In rats only, additional effects were observed in the respiratory tract, bone, incisor teeth, and prolongation of 
clotting time accompanied by haemorrhagic changes in the ileum. The effects on the respiratory system are 
considered likely caused by the oral gavage administration, because similar changes are commonly seen in 
oral gavage studies in rats even in vehicle groups and these were not observed in monkeys. The effects were 
not associated with any findings seen in pneumonia or bronchitis and were reversible, so they were not 
considered to suggest that alectinib causes a clinically significant respiratory disorder. The effects seen in the 
rat long bones and incisor teeth are considered of limited relevance for adult humans. However, potential 
effects of alectinib on bone and tooth development in children cannot be ruled out. A prolonged of clotting 
time (PT and APTT) was seen at a dose higher than the dose causing hepatotoxicity. Since it is known that 
blood coagulation factors are produced in hepatocytes and bleeding tendency is seen in hepatic diseases, the 
prolongation of clotting time may be secondary to the hepatotoxicity in rats. The ileal haemorrhage is 
considered likely secondary to the prolonged clotting time.   
Alectinib was tested in a complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with ICH S2(R1) guidance, 
and in addition, mechanistic in vitro and in vivo micronucleus tests combined with centromere analysis was 
conducted. The obtained data indicate that alectinib induces abnormal chromosomal segregation 
(aneugenicity). Such abnormal chromosome segregations are considered to have a threshold dose, below 
which no increase in DNA damage is expected. Accordingly, the threshold for the induction of micronuclei by 
alectinib using the no observed effect level (NOEL) for micronucleus induction in rats was 200 mg/kg/day 
(Cmax 1850 ng/mL and AUC0-24h 36700 ng·h/mL) corresponding to 2.5-fold clinical exposure based on AUC. 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed which in view of the applied indication is acceptable according to 
the guideline ICH S9. 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies were not conducted with alectinib in agreement with 
ICHS9. No adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology 
studies. These studies were conducted in rats and monkeys at exposures equal to or greater than 2.6- and 
0.5-fold, respectively, of the human exposure, measured by AUC, at the recommended dose of 600 mg twice 
daily. 
Alectinib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits. In pregnant rats, alectinib caused total 
embryo-foetal loss (miscarriage) at exposures 4.5-fold of the human AUC exposure and small foetuses with 
retarded ossification and minor abnormalities of the organs at exposures 2.7-fold of the human AUC 
exposure. In pregnant rabbits, alectinib caused embryo-foetal loss, small foetuses and increased incidence of 
skeletal variations at exposures 2.9-fold of the human AUC exposure at the recommended dose. 
Embryo-foetal toxicity is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Alectinib absorbs UV light between 200 and 400 nm and demonstrated a phototoxic potential in an in vitro 
photosafety test in cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA irradiation. Photosensitivity is listed as a common 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 39/122 
  
  
 
adverse reaction in the SmPC section 4.8 and adequate warnings are included in section 4.4. Photosensitivity 
is also considered an important identified risk for alectinib in the RMP.  
The clinical formulation contains amounts of SLS that are than that previously approved within EU. The daily 
dose of SLS at the maximum recommended clinical dose of alectinib (1200 mg/day) is 600 mg/day i.e. ~10 
mg/kg in a 60 kg patient. This is similar to the SLS dose tested in the 4-week rat study where no SLS-related 
effects in any of the examined parameters were observed. Additionally, SLS did not alter the toxicity of 
alectinib. 
From a toxicological perspective, SLS has protein denaturing properties and may cause damage to cell 
membranes. However, no SLS-related histopathological effects were seen in the 4-week rat study. Data from 
oral administration of SLS in rats are also described in the literature. Results from 4- and 13-week rat studies 
showed the primary effect of SLS to be local irritation of the GI tract, with NOAELs at 100 mg/kg/day. Based 
on the available data, the amount of SLS in the formulation is not considered to pose a significant concern 
although local toxicity in the GI tract is a potential concern. As adverse GI effects have been noted after 
administration of alectinib in both non-clinical studies (without SLS) and in clinical studies (with SLS), the 
actual contribution of SLS to the clinical reactions is unclear. Therefore, a reduction in the SLS amount may 
be beneficial for the clinical GI tolerability (see also discussion on clinical pharmacology). The applicant is 
recommended to introduce an alternative capsule formulation for oral administration containing a lower 
amount of SLS post-approval. 
Metabolite M4 was present in both rats and monkeys and the AUC exposure to M4 in the 13-week repeat-
dose studies represents ~33 to 59% of the clinical M4 exposure. Although, M4 cannot be considered as fully 
qualified from a non-clinical perspective, further non-clinical testing is not warranted based on the intended 
target population with advanced cancer. Overall, the characterisation of M4 is in agreement with 
recommendations given by CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2659/1/2013/III).  
Based on environmental fate and toxicity data as well as on maximal epidemiology-based predicted amounts 
of alectinib on the European market, no significant risks to the environmental compartments sewage 
treatment, surface water, groundwater, sediment and soils have been identified. Overall, therefore, no 
significant risk has been identified for the intended medical use of alectinib in ALK+ NSCLC cancer patients in 
Europe. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of alectinib are well characterized. 
In order to reduce the potential SLS-related effect on GI tract, the applicant is recommended to introduce an 
alternative capsule formulation for oral administration containing a lower amount of SLS post-approval.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Alecensa has been assessed in subjects with NSCLC who have progressed on or 
are intolerant to crizotinib as well as in healthy subjects in five Phase I and two Phase I/II studies (see table 
above). Also, the disposition of alectinib has been evaluated in a number of in vitro studies, including 
metabolism studies, CYP inhibition and induction studies and studies to evaluate transport, transporter 
inhibition, protein binding and blood-plasma ratio.

An active metabolite (M4) of alectinib, with an estimated relative contribution to the activity of Alecensa of 
30-50% based on target binding, has been quantified in laboratory animals and humans. The PK of M4 was 
investigated in most of the submitted in vivo and in vitro studies.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard statistical methods and non-compartmental methods were used to characterize the PK of alectinib 
and M4. The population PK of alectinib was characterised by non-linear mixed effects modelling including data 
from the clinical studies in patients (study NP28673 and NP28761). A physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) model was built using physiological, in vitro and in vivo data and verified based on available clinical 
PK and DDI data for prediction alectinib drug interactions. 
Analytical methods 
In all the completed clinical pharmacology studies included in the submission, plasma concentrations of 
alectinib and the active metabolite M4 were quantified using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods. The 
two applied bioanalysis methods were adequately validated and showed acceptable performance during 
analysis of study samples. However, there was a 21% bias observed between the methods in a cross-
validation study. However, as the poor performing method was only used in study NP28761 this is not 
considered relevant for the PK assessment and will not affect the efficacy/safety evaluation of alectinib. 
Formulations 
The majority of the studies have been performed with the intended commercial formulation, 150 mg hard 
capsule. In addition, an intravenous solution and an oral suspension formulation containing radiolabeled 
alectinib and 20/40 mg hard capsules were used during drug development. 
Due to the high SLS content (50%) of the formulation used during drug development, bioequivalence to the 
50% SLS formulation was investigated for formulations with lower SLS content (25, 12.5 and 3%).  
Absorption 
The time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) was reached after approximately 4 to 6 hours. 
The in vitro permeability of alectinib was studied in Caco-2 cells and was low at 1.810-6 cm/s. The aqueous 
solubility of alectinib was low across the pH range.

Bioavailability 
Absolute bioavailability was investigated as part of study NP28989 in six healthy volunteers.

Table 12: Mean (± SD) alectinib concentration versus time profiles following a 600 mg single oral dose of 
alectinib and following a 50 μg single IV dose of [14C]-alectinib in period 1 
The geometric mean exposure ratio (PO/IV) for dose normalized alectinib AUC0-∞ as a measure of absolute 
bioavailability was 36.9% (90% CI: 33.9 to 40.3) under fed conditions in healthy subjects. 
Alectinib steady-state is reached within 7 days with continuous 600 mg twice daily dosing. The accumulation 
ratio for the twice-daily 600 mg regimen was approximately 6-fold. 
• 
Bioequivalence (Study NP29040) 
The bioequivalence of the different alectinib formulations following oral administration in healthy subjects was 
investigated in a randomized, open-label, single dose, cross-over study. The bioequivalence of treatments A 
(reference, 50% SLS), B (25% SLS), C (12.5% SLS) and D (3% SLS) was investigated both in a fasted and 
fed state.

Bioequivalence (based on Cmax and AUC) between formulations was also evaluated based on the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of the total molar sum of alectinib and M4 since both contributed to the effect of 
Alecensa. A similar pattern as presented above for alectinib was seen, only with formulation B (25% SLS) 
being bioequivalent to formulation A (50% SLS).

Influence of food 
The effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the single oral dose PK of alectinib and M4 in healthy subjects 
was investigated as part of Study NP28991. 
Table 15: Mean plasma concentration vs time profiles of alectinib (RO5424802) and M4 (RO5468924) 
Table 16: Statistical estimates of effect of high-fat meal on the PK parameters of alectinib (RO5424802) and 
M4 (RO5468924) 
The alectinib median Tmax was prolonged from 4 hours in the fasting state to 8 hours in the fed state. For 
M4 the median Tmax was prolonged from 8 hours in the fasting state to 10 hours in the fed state. 
The molecular weight-adjusted M/P ratios of AUC0-∞ were similar for fasted and fed conditions. 
Distribution 
Human plasma protein binding and binding proteins of alectinib were evaluated in vitro by equilibrium dialysis 
in studies 1054086 and 1056250. The plasma protein binding ratio of alectinib at concentrations of 100-

10000 ng/mL were all >99%. The alectinib–HSA binding ratio was 97% at concentrations of 100-1000 
ng/mL, but was only 4.9% for a1–AAG, at all concentrations. 
The human plasma protein binding of metabolite M4, evaluated by equilibrium dialysis assay, was >99% at 
concentrations of 0.3-2 mg/mL in study 1057255. 
The mean in vitro human blood-to-plasma concentration ratios of alectinib and M4 are 2.64 and 2.50, 
respectively, at clinically relevant concentrations. 
The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of alectinib following IV administration was 
475 L, indicating extensive distribution into tissues. 
Alectinib demonstrated penetration into the CNS. CSF samples were collected in 8 patients receiving alectinib 
in study NP28761. The alectinib concentration in CSF was 0.2-0.5% of the concentration in plasma, which is 
similar to unbound fraction in plasma based on in vitro protein binding (0.3%). Penetration into CNS of M4 
has not been demonstrated. 
Elimination 
Alectinib is suggested to be eliminated by two main primary metabolic clearance pathways, the M4/M6 
pathway by CYP3A4 metabolism (estimated to contribute 40-50% of alectinib metabolism) and the M1a/M1b 
pathway likely to be catalyzed by a combination of CYP isozymes (including isozymes other than CYP3A) and 
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes.  
Results from the human mass balance study demonstrated that alectinib and M4 were the main circulating 
moieties in plasma with 76% of the total radioactivity in plasma. The geometric mean Metabolite/Parent ratio 
at steady state is 0.399.

Based on the final popPK analysis, the geometric mean of the individual elimination half-life estimates after 
single and multiple doses of alectinib is 20 hours and 32.5 hours respectively. The individual elimination half-
life estimates after multiple doses of M4 is 30.7 hours. 
The apparent clearance (CL/F) was 81.9 L/hour and 217 L/hour for alectinib and M4 respectively. 
The molecular weight adjusted geometric mean M/P (M4/alectinib) ratios for AUC0-t and Cmax were 0.368-
0.515 and 0.324-0.494, respectively, following 600 mg BID repeated dosing of alectinib in phase II studies. 
Following administration of a 600 mg single oral dose of [14C]-alectinib in study NP28989, administered orally 
to healthy subjects the majority of radioactivity was excreted in faeces (mean recovery 97.8%) with minimal 
excretion in urine (mean recovery 0.46%). In faeces, 84% of the dose was excreted as unchanged alectinib. 
In faeces and urine 5.8, 0.2 and 7.7% of the alectinib dose was excreted as M4, M6 and M1a/M1b 
respectively. The remaining identified radioactivity in excreta was made up by alectinib.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality analysis of alectinib and M4 Cmax and AUCinf after single and multiple dose (460-900 mg) 
was performed as part of study NP28761. 
After single dose administration, Cmax and AUCinf increased with increasing doses in the investigated dose 
range. A linear regression was performed and alectinib Cmax and AUCinf had a slope of 0.750 (90% CI: 0.188, 
1.313) and 0.752 (90% CI: 0.060, 1.440) across the 460 to 900 mg dose range respectively.  
After multiple dose administration, Cmax and AUCinf increased with increasing doses in the investigated dose 
range. Linear regression of alectinib Cmax and AUClast resulted in slopes of 0.908 (90% CI: 0.526, 1.290) and 
1.110 (90% CI: 0.652, 1.573) across the 460 to 900 mg BID dose range.  
In addition, dose proportionality was assessed using popPK modelling. The comparisons of the post hoc 
estimate for the PK parameters (Table 18), results confirmed that alectinib is dose proportional from 300 mg 
to 900 mg. 
Table 18: Post hoc (CL/F and V/F) estimates of the PK parameters for alectinib by dose category  
The mean accumulation ratio for alectinib and M4 ranges 4.55-8.87 and 5.23-11.5 respectively across the 
300-900 mg dose range without no clear trend in study NP28761. The accumulation ratios in study NP28673, 
based on AUC0-10 ratios day 21/day 1 was similar at 6.95 and 8.68 for alectinib and M4 respectively. The 
accumulation ratio is higher than than expected based on estimations using alectinib and M4 single-dose half-
lifes (around 3-fold accumulation).

Population PK model 
The objectives of the population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis was to develop a model to describe the PK 
of alectinib and M4, explore covariates that contribute to the between-patient variability in PK parameters of 
alectinib and M4 and derive individual estimates of PK parameters. 
Only data from study NP28673 was used to characterise the PK of alectinib and M4 in this popPK model. 
Population PK analyses were performed using the software NONMEM version 7.2.0. 
The population PK of alectinib and M4 was described by a one-compartment with first-order elimination. Body 
weight statistically influenced both CL/F and V/F of alectinib and M4 and was therefore included in the base 
structural PK model for alectinib and M4. 
The geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-12hr for alectinib were 
approximately 665 ng/mL (44.3%), 572 ng/mL (47.8%) and 7430 ng*h/mL (45.7%), respectively. The 
geometric mean steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-12hr for M4 were approximately 246 ng/mL (45.4%), 222 
ng/mL (46.6%) and 2810 ng*h/mL (45.9%), respectively. 
The NONMEM parameter estimates for the final popPK model for alectinib are summarized in Table 19.

Special populations 
No dedicated renal or hepatic impairment study has been submitted by the applicant. 
Negligible amounts of alectinib and the active metabolite M4 are excreted unchanged in urine (< 0.2% of the 
dose). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis alectinib and M4 exposures were similar in patients 
with mild and moderate renal impairment and normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of alectinib has 
not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.

As elimination of alectinib is predominantly through metabolism in the liver, hepatic impairment may increase 
the plasma concentration of alectinib and/or its major metabolite M4. Based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, alectinib and M4 exposures were similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment and normal 
hepatic function.

An exploratory analysis of the effect of race, white (n=6) vs. asian (n=20) populations, on alectinib PK was 
included in study NP28673. No statistical significant influence of race on the PK parameters was identified 
during covariate model building in the popPK model for either alectinib or M4. However, the clearance was 
lower in asian patients as compared to white patients both for alectinib (66±25.7 vs. 91.4±37.8 L/h) and M4 
(202.5±72.9 vs. 226.6±111.5).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The drug-drug interaction potential of alectinib was investigated in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme mediating the metabolism of both alectinib and its 
major active metabolite M4, and CYP3A contributes to 40%  50% of total hepatic metabolism. M4 has 
shown similar in vitro potency and activity against ALK. 
In vitro, neither alectinib nor M4 are considered clinically relevant systemic direct inhibitors of CYP-enzymes. 
Alectinib is likely to be a time-dependent and intestinal inhibitor of CYP3A4. A signal of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A 
in vitro induction was observed.  
Alectinib did not inhibit OATP1B1/OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. 
Based on in vitro data, alectinib is not a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of BCRP or 
organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/B3. M4 was identified as a P-gp substrate. 
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampicin once daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a 
single oral dose of 600 mg alectinib reduced alectinib Cmax,and AUCinf by 51% and 73% respectively and 
increased M4 Cmax and AUCinf 2.20 and 1.79-fold respectively. The effect on the combined exposure of 
alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax and AUCinf by 4% and 18%, respectively.   
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 400 mg posaconazole twice daily, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with a 
single oral dose of 300 mg alectinib increased alectinib exposure Cmax and AUCinf by 1.18 and 1.75-fold 
respectively, and reduced M4 Cmax and AUCinf by 71% and 25% respectively .The effect on the combined 
exposure of alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax by 7% and increasing AUCinf 1.36-fold. 
The metabolic ratio (M/P) of M4 and alectinib is 0.3-0.5 at normal conditions. However, when Alectinib is 
coadministrated with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor posaconazole and CYP3A inducer rifampin the M/P of M4 is 
altered to 0.22 and 3.74 respectively. 
Alectinib and M4 were identified as P-gp and BCRP inhibitors in vitro.

As alectinib exhibits pH dependent solubility, a potential interaction with esomeprazole that change gastric pH 
has been evaluated. Multiple doses of esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 40 mg once daily, 
demonstrated no clinically relevant effect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4. 
In vitro, alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and BCRP. 
In vitro, alectinib and M4 show weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4, and alectinib exhibits a weak 
induction potential of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at clinical concentrations.   
Multiple doses of 600 mg alectinib had no influence on the exposure of midazolam (2 mg), a sensitive CYP3A 
substrate.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No mechanism of action studies have been conducted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The EML4-ALK fusion gene product is a chimeric oncoprotein with constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity. A 
large number of ALK EML4 fusion variants have been described and there are also additional fusion partners 
such as TGF. 
ALK positive (ALK+) tumours treated with the first licensed ALK inhibitor (ALKi) invariably develop secondary 
resistance that might be related to secondary mutations, fusion gene amplification and activation of 
alternative signalling pathways. Alectinib shows in essence full inhibitory activity in the most predictable 
secondary mutation (L1196M) associated with resistance to treatment with crizotinib, but less activity in case 
of other mutations such as G1202R. Resistance associated mutations related to alectinib treatment have also 
been described, in case of the resistance mutation I1171N ceritinib has been shown to be active. Of note in 
terms of fold change to the wild type mutation alectinib appears as sensitive to resistance mutations as 
crizotinib, the main difference being that higher exposure intensity is tolerated for alectinib (for details see 
non-clinical section).     
RET (rearranged during transfection), the other TK targeted by alectinib, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase 
of importance for proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in RET have been identified e.g. in NSCLC and 
alectinib has shown promising inhibitory potential. 
Secondary pharmacology 
QTc: Based on non-clinical studies the risk for QT prolongation is considered low, about 8-30 fold margin 
based on free Css and Cmax (please refer to the non-clinical section). A total of 221 patients who received 
alectinib 600 mg BID were analysed with respect ECG changes without conspicuous findings. 
There was no observed exposure – QTcF relationship.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 52/122 
  
  
Heart rate: The heart rate (HR) decreased with about 10 to 13 beats per minute (see safety). This effect is 
considered ALK inhibitor class related. A clear exposure – HR relationship was shown. This was not seen in 
non-clinical studies, but might have been masked by hypotension induced increase in HR. Hypotension was 
not reported in clinical studies.    
Across the dose range of 300 to 900 mg BID in phase studies, graphical analyses showed an exposure-
response relationship for the change in tumour size over time. Lower exposure was associated with less 
decrease in tumour size over time.  At the 600 mg dose level, the Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed 
that the variability in exposure was not associated with differences in PFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 53/122 
  
  
 
 
The explorative exposure-response analyses indicate that lower alectinib doses could potentially results in 
reduced efficacy, putatively related also to pattern of secondary mutations. If an increase in exposure from 
doses higher than 600 BID will result in higher efficacy is difficult to determine from the rather limited data 
available. However, an indication that the effect appears to plateau at 900 mg BID is visible in the graphical 
analysis of the phase I data. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
M4, but not alectinib, is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Alectinib, but not the active metabolite M4, 
demonstrated penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) with CSF concentrations corresponding to 
the unbound concentration in plasma. Even so, Alectinib has shown to be effective also against brain 
metastases and therefore the uncertainty of M4 CNS distribution is considered acceptable.  
The combined data on absolute bioavailability and mass balance of alectinib in study NP28989 is crucial to 
elucidate the elimination pathways of alectinib. Metabolism is the major elimination pathway with some 
possible contribution of biliary/intestinal secretion.The major drug interaction risks have been identified and 
handled. 
The main elimination pathway of alectinib is via metabolism/excretion in the liver. Therefore, the ongoing 
clinical study on the effect of hepatic impairment on alectinib and M4 PK is important and planned to be 
submitted post-approval. Thus, this study has been included in the risk management plan as a post-approval 
commitment. 
Population PK analysis supports dose proportionality for alectinib across the dose range of 300 to 900 mg 
under fed conditions. 
Based on available data, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Alectinib 
has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, Alectinib is not 
recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC). 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of alectinib will be further investigated in a 
multiple-center, open-label study following single oral dosing of alectinib (study NP29783) in subjects with 
hepatic impairment and in matched healthy subjects. The final study report will be submitted by 30 April 
2018 (see RMP). 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Alectinib has not been 
studied in patients with severe renal impairment. However, since alectinib elimination via the kidney is 
negligible, no dose adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 
of the SmPC). 
Age, race and gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of alectinib and M4. 
Exposure of alectinib and M4 decreased with increasing weight after dosing to steady-state. However, the 
exposure seems to reach a plateau and no dose adjustments seems warranted. Therefore, it is stated in the 
SmPC that although PK simulations do not indicate a low exposure in patients with extreme body weight (i.e. 
>130 kg), alectinib is widely distributed and clinical studies for alectinib enrolled patients within a range of 
body weights of 36.9-123 kg. There are no available data on patients with body weight above 130 kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 54/122 
  
  
The limited data on the safety and efficacy of Alectinib in patients aged 65 years and older do not suggest 
that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). There are no 
available data on patients over 80 years of age. 
Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments are required when 
Alectinib is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients taking 
concomitant strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)). 
Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments are required when 
Alectinib is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients 
taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole nefazodone, grapefruit or Seville oranges). 
No dose adjustments are required when Alectinib is co-administered with proton pump inhibitors or other 
medicinal products which raise gastric pH (e.g. H2 receptor antagonists or antacids). 
A risk for induction of CYP2B6 and PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely excluded 
based on the submitted in vitro data. However, given the totality of data regarding CYP3A induction and TDI 
(e.g. midazolam study, hepatocyte induction study) the risk for either a clinically relevant PXR/CAR induction 
or a clinically relevant TDI of CYP3A4 is considered limited and no dose adjustment is required for co-
administered CYP3A substrates. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may 
be reduced. 
Since alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP, 
they may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp or 
BCRP. When Alectinib is co-administered with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, topotecan, 
sirolimus, everolimus, nilotinib and lapatinib), or BCRP substrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g., 
methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan and lapatinib), appropriate monitoring is recommended (see section 
4.5 of the SmPC). 
Alectinib has shown reproductive toxicity in animal studies and conducting an interaction study between 
alectinib and oral contraceptives is not considered feasible. Therefore, the issue of appropriate contraception 
during and after alectinib treatment has been solved by clear recommendations in the SmPC. 
As part of a scientific advice procedure, the Applicant was recommended to introduce an alternative capsule 
formulation for oral administration containing a lower amount of SLS post-approval. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of alectinib and its active metabolite M4 have been sufficiently 
characterized. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
- In order to reduce the potential SLS-related effect on GI tract, the applicant is recommended to introduce 
an alternative capsule formulation for oral administration containing a lower amount of SLS post-approval. 
- Alecensa has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The applicant will 
conduct a study to assess the PK in subjects with hepatic impairment and submit the results by 30 April 
2018.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The first in human Phase I/II study, AF-001JP, in ALK-positive crizotinib-naïve NSCLC patients was conducted 
by Chugai. Based on data from this study (ORR about 90+%) alectinib was granted marketing access in 
Japan on 4 July 2014 with the indication: ALK-fusion gene-positive, unresectable, recurrent / advanced 
NSCLC. The dose was 300 mg BID. Further dose escalation was stopped due to regulatory concerns related 
to the high dose of the excipient SLS (see quality and non-clinical). 
In July 2014, Roche initiated a Phase III global study to evaluate alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-
naïve patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC (BO28984, ALEX study). This trial is currently ongoing and 
no data are available. A separate Phase III Chugai-sponsored study (JO28928) with a design similar to the 
BO28984 (ALEX) study in patients who were ALK-inhibitor naïve and may have received up to one prior 
chemotherapy regimen for ALK–positive NSCLC is ongoing in Japan. 
This submission is based on two ongoing Phase I/II studies evaluating alectinib in ALK-positive NSCLC 
patients who have progressed on crizotinib treatment (studies NP28673 and NP28761). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study NP28761 – Phase I 
A total of 47 patients with ALK positive NSCLC after failure on crizotinib, were enrolled and treated in cohorts 
in a staggered manner at an initial dose level of 600 mg/day (300 mg BID). Patients in Cohort 1 received 
alectinib under fasting conditions whereas all other cohorts received alectinib under fed conditions.

DLTs 
DLT was defined as:  
1. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
2. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
3. Grade 4 neutropenia continuing for ≥ 7 consecutive days 
4. Non-hematological toxicity of Grade 3 or higher 
5. Adverse events that required suspension of treatment for a total of ≥ 7 days

Two DLTs were reported in the alectinib 900 mg BID PK bridging cohort: AE of Grade 3 headache in one 
patient (progressive but asymptomatic brain metastases) and an AE of Grade 3 neutrophil count decreased in 
one patient requiring study drug interruption for a week.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Due to the similarity in study designs and patient eligibility criteria in the two pivotal studies NP28761 and 
NP28673, data will be presented in parallel. 
Study NP28761: A Phase I/II Study of the ALK Inhibitor alectinib (CH5424802/RO5424802) in 
patients with ALK-rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer previously treated with Crizotinib. 
Study NP28761 is an on-going multi-centre, single arm, open-label, dose escalation study to determine the 
safety, tolerability and activity of alectinib as a single agent in patients with either locally advanced (AJCC 
Stage IIIB) and not amenable to curative therapy or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) ALK-positive NSCLC who had 
experienced disease progression on crizotinib with or without prior chemotherapy. 
Radiologic assessments in study NP28761 were performed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 at Cycles 2, 4, 
and 6 between Days 14 to 21 and every 9 weeks thereafter.

Sample size

A sample size of 85 was chosen such that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (using a 
Clopper-Pearson CI) around the point estimate of the ORR allowed identification of a clinically relevant 
response in order to reject the null hypothesis (H0) that ORR = 35%. With 85 patients, an observed response 
rate of 46% (39/85 responses) would have a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of 35% which is considered 
to be clinically relevant, and thus the null hypothesis could be rejected.  
The primary analysis was to occur once all patients enrolled in Phase II were followed for a minimum of 12 
weeks, essentially after two tumour assessments had been performed in order that any observed CR or PR 
could be confirmed, unless patients progressed, died or withdrew sooner. 
A non-binding interim analysis for futility was planned after 30 patients had been dosed and followed at least 
until their first post-baseline tumour assessment (6 weeks post-treatment). The analysis was based on the 
investigator-assessed ORR in RE population. If ≥ 9 responders were observed, the Phase II portion would 
continue to enrol a planned total of approximately 85 patients. If ≤ 8 responders were observed, accrual 
could be discontinued. The futility analysis was performed by an IMC.

Results 
Participant flow 
Disposition of Patients in Phase II: 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled in 26 centres in the US and one site in Canada. The first patient was enrolled on 03 
May 2012 and the last patient was enrolled on 04 August 2014. 
The data cut-off date for the primary analysis was 24 October 2014 and the database lock date was 10 
December 2014.  
Conduct of the study 
Six protocol amendments were made and a summary of the major changes relating to study design, 
objectives or entry criteria is provided below.  
Protocol Version 2: 18 November 2011 
In Version 2 “NSCLC that has failed crizotinib treatment” was added to the inclusion criteria for Phase I.  
Protocol Version 3: 14 May 2012 
Key changes in Version 3 were modifications to the dose-escalation design of Phase I. 
Protocol Version 4: 10 August 2012 
Version 4 added surgery for brain metastases within two weeks of starting treatment to the list of exclusion 
criteria and to allow concurrent radiation therapy for palliation or symptom relief of brain or bone metastases 
within 24 hours of last dose of alectinib and re-start of study drug upon resolution of any radiation toxicity to 
≤ Grade 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 63/122 
  
  
 
Version 5: 12 March 2013 
Phase II consisted of a single population of patients that had failed crizotinib Phase I (instead of two sub-
populations A [crizotinib-failed] and B [crizotinib-naïve]); the study design was modified to conduct Phase II 
under fed conditions only; and measures of efficacy in the CNS (CNS response rate in patients with brain 
lesions that were not irradiated and CNS relapse rate) were added to the secondary objectives for Phase II. 
Version 6: 24 June 2013 
The wash-out period for crizotinib was decreased from 2 weeks to 1 week in order to avoid potential disease 
flare ups. 
Version 7: 17 December 2013 
The study population definition was changed to “Patients with locally advanced (AJCC Stage IIIB) not 
amenable to curative therapy or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) NSCLC” (previously “locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC”); CORR, CDOR, CPR, and QoL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 were added as 
secondary efficacy endpoints for Phase II; measures of efficacy in CNS (CNS response rate in patients with 
brain lesions that were not irradiated, and CNS relapse rate), were changed to CNS ORR, CNS DOR, and CNS 
progression rate (CPR) assessed using RECIST v1.1 and RANO criteria; the statistical hypothesis for efficacy 
and statistical methods (null hypothesis that ORR = 35% instead of ORR = 50%) were clarified. 
Protocol violations 
One patient had a major protocol violation at baseline. The patient tested ALK-positive with a non FDA-
approved FISH test. In the absence of any safety concerns noted, the patient continued to receive alectinib 
and was not excluded from the study or analyses. 
During the study ten major protocol violations occurred in eight patients (9%) for the following reasons: 
• Use of prohibited medications/procedures (7 violations in five patients). These violations pertained to the 
administration of corticosteroids at doses higher than allowed per protocol, potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and 
radiosurgery/ radiotherapy. • Study drug not taken according to protocol (2 violations in 2 patients) 
• Missing tumour assessment at a scheduled visit (1 violation in 1 patient). 
At the time of discovering these violations, no safety concerns were identified. No patient who violated the 
study protocol was excluded from any analysis and all patients continued on study drug as planned.

Duration of Response (DOR) 
Of the 33 patients achieving PR in the IRC assessment of the RE population, six patients experienced 
progression of their disease. The median DOR was 7.5 months.  
Progression - Free Survival (PFS) 
At the time of the data cut off, 35 of 87 patients (40%) had progressed or died based on IRC assessments. 
The majority due to PD. The estimated median duration of PFS was about 6 months.  
Overall Survival (OS) 
At the time of data cut-off, 14% enrolled in Phase II had died. Due to the low number of deaths, the median 
OS could not be estimated.

Study NP28673: An open-label, non-randomized, multicentre Phase I/II trial of alectinib 
(RO5424802) given orally to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients who have ALK mutation and 
who have failed crizotinib treatment. 
This study was conducted in three parts:  
● Phase I, Part 1: A dose-escalation phase with the objective of assessing the safety, tolerability, and PK of 
alectinib 600 mg BID and 900 mg BID dose regimens. During the conduct of Part 1 for this study, the RP2D 
(600 mg BID) was confirmed in study NP28761 and Part 1 and Part 2 were combined.  
● Phase II, Part 2: A safety and efficacy evaluation phase  
● Phase II, Part 3: A post-progression treatment phase 
Radiologic assessments were performed at screening and every 8 weeks in the first year, every 12 weeks in 
the second year and every 16 weeks subsequently until disease progression. 
Patients in Part 2 that were considered by the investigator to still benefit from treatment, could be included in 
the treatment beyond progression in Part 3, where they could continue to receive alectinib alone or, if their 
tumour harboured an EGFR activating mutation, in combination with erlotinib. However, all patients in Part 3 
have continued with alectinib monotherapy only. No patients have received erlotinib in combination with 
alectinib at this point.

Treatments 
Alectinib as a single agent was administered orally at a dose of 600 mg BID within 30 minutes after meals in 
the morning and evening. Patients received alectinib at the stated dose for 5 cycles (28 days) continuously, 
starting on Cycle 1, Day 1. When a patient missed a dose of alectinib, it could be taken within 4 hours of the 
scheduled  time.  If  the  time  was  greater  than  4  hours,  or  the  patient  vomited  the  dose,  the  patient  was 
instructed to wait and take the next scheduled dose.

• To evaluate the safety profile of alectinib in combination with erlotinib using the NCI-CTCAE v 4.03 (Part 3) 
• To evaluate the ALK mutations in tumor and blood samples and correlate it with response to alectinib, 
where possible 
• To evaluate the co-expression of EGFR mutation with ALK translocation and ALK mutation status 
• To investigate potential bypass mechanisms of ALK inhibition, such as cMET, KRAS and cKIT 
Sample size 
A sample size of 85 was chosen such that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI; using 
an exact Clopper-Pearson CI) around the point estimate of the ORR allowed identifying a clinically relevant 
response in order to reject the null hypothesis that ORR = 35%. With 85 patients, an observed response rate 
of 46% (39/85 responses) would have a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of 35.02% which is considered 
to be clinically relevant and the null hypothesis would be rejected. Therefore, at least 85 patients treated with 
prior chemotherapy would need to be enrolled. A total enrolment of 130 patients was planned, with a 
maximum of 45 chemo-naïve patients to ensure the minimum number requirement of 85 prior-chemotherapy 
patients was met. 
With 130 patients, an observed response rate of 44% (57/130 responses) would have a lower limit of the 
two-sided 95% CI of 35.2% which is considered to be clinically relevant and the null hypothesis would be 
rejected. With 130 patients, there was 93% power, based on an exact test for single proportion, to detect a 
15% increase in ORR from 35% to 50% at the 5% two-sided significance level. 
Randomisation 
N/A 
Blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Statistical methods 
Hierarchical testing was used. The primary analysis tested the null hypothesis of the best ORR for alectinib 
equal to 35%, against the alternative hypothesis that the best ORR for alectinib was not equal to 35%, with 
two-sided alpha of 0.05. This primary analysis was tested in the all patients group (patients with and without 
prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment). 
If the primary test was significant, then the subsequent test also tested the null hypothesis of the best ORR 
for alectinib equal to 35%, against the alternative hypothesis that the best ORR for alectinib was not equal to 
35%, with two-sided alpha of 0.05. However this subsequent analysis was tested only in the group of 
patients with prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
A total of 138 patients were enrolled and treated in Phase II of the study at 56 sites in 16 countries globally 
(France (11), the US (10), Italy (8), Spain (6), the Republic of Korea (4), Taiwan (3), Germany (3), the 
Netherlands (2), Australia (2), UK (1), Luxemburg (1), Belgium (1), Sweden (1), Singapore (1), Denmark (1) 
and the Russian Federation(1). 
Data cutoff date was 18 August 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
The initial protocol, dated 12 December 2012, was amended four times. A summary of the main changes 
made to the protocol are summarised below. 
Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2): 21 December 2012 
Protocol Version 1 was amended to remove exclusion criterion regarding use of anticoagulation or 
thrombolytic agent within 2 weeks prior to Day 1.  
Protocol Amendments 3 and 4 (Versions 4 and 5): 19 November 2013 (v4) and 30 January 2014 (v5) 
During submission of protocol Version 4, additional changes were identified that required the creation of 
protocol amendment Version 5. The following changes include those made to Versions 4 and 5: 
1. To incorporate a MDZ DDI sub-study to be conducted in approximately 14 additional patients with ALK-
positive NSCLC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 75/122 
  
  
 
2. To clarify the Stage IIIb NSCLC study patients to be included in the study, as per FDA request: Only Stage 
IIIb NSCLC patients whose disease was not amenable to curative therapy would be eligible for the study, as 
other Stage IIIb patients may be eligible to other multimodality treatments. 
3. To remove the restriction for the last dose of crizotinib to be within 60 days from the first dose of alectinib. 
This restriction was first put in place to avoid possible resensitization to crizotinib and ensure that all patients 
are true crizotinib-failure. However, this limitation was thought to potentially affect enrollment as it may not 
have allowed enough time for patients to progress on subsequent chemotherapy treatments. 
4. To update the permitted and prohibited medications based on the available DDI information for alectinib  
Violations at Baseline 
Table 35: Summary of Major Protocol Violations at Baseline (NP28673) 
Violations during study 
In total, 26 major protocol violations occurred in 23 patients (17%) during the study for the following 
reasons: 
• Use of prohibited medications/procedures (19 violations [18 medications, 1 procedure] in 16 patients). Of 
note, of the 18 violations due to use of prohibited medications, nine were due to use of antacids and P-gp 
substrates. While these were considered prohibited concomitant medications at the time these violations 
occurred, their use was permitted in the latest version (Version E) of the study protocol. 
• Study drug not taken according to protocol (6 violations in 6 patients) 
• Missing tumour assessment at a scheduled visit (1 violation in 1 patient).  
No patient who violated the study protocol was excluded from any analysis (efficacy or safety) and all 
patients continued on study drug as planned.

Supportive study 
Study AF-001JP is a multicentre, open label Phase I/II Study of CH5424802 in Patients with Non-small Cell 
Lung Cancer Harbouring the ALK Fusion Gene. 
The study was conducted in 13 sites in Japan. The study period was 24 August 2010 to 18 April 2013. 
A total of 24 patients were enrolled in Phase I and were assigned to one of the seven alectinib dose cohorts 
(20, 40, 80, 160, 240, and 300 [fed/fasted] mg BID). In Phase II, 46 patients were enrolled and all received 
treatment with alectinib 300 mg BID. In phase II at least one prior line of chemotherapy was required. Prior 
treatment with an ALK inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 92/122 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In Phase II, mean age of the population was 49.5 years (range: 26 to 75 years), with 42/46 patients being < 
65 years old. There were 52% women and 48% men.  The majority of patients (59%) had never smoked (or 
hardly smoked).  ECOG PS was 0 in 20 patients (44%) and 1 in 26 patients (57%).  The histological type was 
adenocarcinoma in all 46 patients. Disease stage was IIIB in 2 patients (4%), IV in 31 patients (67%), and 
postoperative recurrence in 13 patients (28%). 
In Phase I, alectinib 300 mg BID was chosen as the RP2D in Japanese patients on the basis of safety, PK, and 
efficacy data.  Of the 20 Phase I patients, 18 patients had an investigator-assessed BOR of PR and 2 patients 
had SD. 
In Phase II, the IRC-assessed response rate in the 46 crizotinib-naïve patients enrolled was 93.5% (95% CI: 
82.1% to 98.6%), with 7 of the patients achieving a CR and 36 achieving a PR. Due to the low number of 
events, the median values for PFS and OS could not be estimated. One-year PFS rate was 83% (95% CI: 
68% to 92%) and 1-year survival rate was 93% (95% CI: 81% to 98%). 
Study JO28928 (J-ALEX) 
During the procedure, the applicant submitted high-level data from J-ALEX, an open-label, randomized (1:1) 
Phase III study comparing alectinib head to head with crizotinib in patients who were ALK-inhibitor naïve and 
may have received up to one prior chemotherapy regimen for ALK–positive NSCLC. 
This study is conducted in Japanese patients and the dosing is alectinib 300 BID as opposed to the dosing in 
the two studies pertinent to this application i.e. 600 BID. 
The data presented are from a pre-planned interim analysis with 50% of the targeted PFS events. The 
median duration of follow-up at the time of this analysis was 12 months (range: 1 to 23 months) for the 
alectinib arm and 12 months (range: 0 to 20 months) for the crizotinib arm. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The benefit assessment is based on two Phase I/II studies, NP28761 (n=87, US/ Canada) and NP28673 
(n=138, global) that enrolled patients with ALK positive NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib (Xalkori).  
The amendments and protocol violations in the two studies are deemed unlikely to have a relevant impact on 
the integrity of the study. 
In further support of the application the AF-001JP study has been submitted which is a Phase I/II study 
performed in Japanese patients with ALK positive NSCLC that had not received prior crizotinib. In this study 
conducted in chemotherapy pre-treated but ALK inhibitor naïve patients, the ORR was very high about 94 % 
and the 1-year PFS rate was 83%. This study did not report any CORR and CNS DCR data. 
The design of the dose finding study (phase I of study NP28761) is considered standard for an oncology 
study. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined i.e. 600 mg BID, is considered reasonably well 
justified. Study NP28673 also had a dose escalation portion (Part 1) but as the RP2D was defined in study 
NP28761, patients in the NP28673 Phase I part were included in the Phase II part (n=6).  
Both pivotal studies were single arm studies and very similar in study design and patient eligibility criteria. 
Patient demographics were consistent with that of a NSCLC ALK positive population. The demographic 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 93/122 
  
  
characteristics of the overall study population were 67% Caucasian, 26% Asian, 56% females, and the 
median age was 52 years. The majority of patients had no history of smoking (70%). 
The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 90.6% of 
patients and 2 in 9.4% of patients. At the time of entry in the study, 99% of patients had stage IV disease, 
61% had brain metastases and in 96% of patients tumours were classified as adenocarcinoma. Among 
patients included in the study, 20% of the patients had previously progressed on crizotinib treatment only, 
and 80% had previously progressed on crizotinib and at least one chemotherapy treatment. 
Furthermore the patients enrolled were rather heavily pre-treated with 54% having received ≥ 3 lines of 
therapy prior to enrolment (including crizotinib). The majority (74%) had received a previous platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen and 64% had received prior radiotherapy for NSCLC with main targets brain 
metastases (47 %), bone and lung. About half of the population had undergone at least one previous surgical 
procedure for NSCLC. 
As required by the study protocols, all 225 patients in the overall population had previously received 
crizotinib. The median time on crizotinib was about 12 months (range 1 day to 4.5 years) and time since last 
dose of crizotinib was about a fortnight (range 7 days to 2 years). 
The Applicant has provided best response achieved while on crizotinib for the respective studies. For the 87 
patients in NP28761: one patient had CR (1.1 %), 28 patients had PR (32.2 %), 22 patients with SD (25.3 
%) and 27 patients with PD (31.0 %). A total of nine patients were deemed NE/NA/Unknown (10.3 %). The 
corresponding numbers for study NP28673 were: PR 75 patients (54.3 %), SD 30 patients (21.7 %), PD 27 
patients (19.6 %) and 6 (4.3 %) patients NA/Unknown. No patient had CR as best reported response on 
crizotinib.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
While primary endpoint in NP28761 and NP28673 was ORR by IRC assessment (RECIST 1.1 with 4 week 
confirmation), NP28673 also had a co-primary endpoint of ORR by IRC assessment in patients pre-treated 
with chemotherapy. 
The primary objective was met in both studies and ORR by IRC was 48 % and 49 % in NP28761 and NP 
28673 respectively. ORR by IRC for the patients pre-treated with chemotherapy was 44 %. 
A partial response was obtained in 48 % and 49 % in in NP28761 and NP 28673 respectively and stable 
disease was achieved in 32 % and 30 % respectively. About 16 % had progressive disease, similar in both 
studies.  
Data cut-off for NP28761 was 24 October 2014. For NP28673 data cut-off for the primary analysis was 18 
August 2014 with an update provided with data cut-off date 8 January 2015. Only limited number of 
additional events had occurred at the latter.  
Among secondary endpoints was ORR by Investigator with 46 % responders in NP28761 and 48 % in 
NP28673. ORR (Inv) in patients pre-treated with chemotherapy in NP28673 was 46 %. 
Results on ORR based on subgroups (by age, gender, race, ECOG PS, CNS metastasis, smoking status, 
baseline body weight, and prior chemotherapy use), were generally consistent with the ORR in the overall 
population for both pivotal studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017

DCR as assessed by IRC was about 64 % in both studies although the definition of SD varied between the 
two studies with duration for at least 12 weeks in NP28761 and 16 weeks in NP28673. 
In terms of time-related secondary endpoints such as DOR, PFS and OS, too few events had occurred which 
precluded any firm conclusions to be drawn. The Applicant has as requested (former MO Q 22), provided 
updates with data cut-off dates of 22 January 2016 for NP28761 and 1 February 2016 for NP28673:  
For PFS, with 67% of the patients in study NP28761 experiencing an event, a mature estimate of the median 
PFS can be expected. The median PFS as assessed by IRC is about 8 months. In study NP28673, the median 
PFS by IRC (71% data maturity) is about 9 months. The pooled analysis shows a median PFS of 
approximately 8 months (69% data maturity). These results are considered clinically meaningful compared 
with the results obtained with ceritinib in a similar patient population (Study A: 6.9 months and Study B: 5.7 
months). 
For OS, the pooled updated median OS is 26 months based on 43% data maturity. These results are also 
clinically meaningful, and indirect comparison with ceritinib seems to show that alectinib fares at least as 
good (Study A: 16.7 months, Study B: 14.0 months). Study 1007 (crizotinib vs chemotherapy, second-line) 
showed a median PFS of 7.7 months and a median OS of 20.3 months.  
In regard to CNS DOR a total 50 patients had measurable CNS lesions at baseline. The updated analyses 
show that the median CNS DOR for these patients is 11 months (which is slightly better than the primary 
pooled analysis of 9 months). This is considered of high clinical relevance. In the pivotal trial in the approval 
of ceritinib, patients with symptomatic CNS metastases were excluded.  
Overall, the updated results from the two pivotal studies continue to demonstrate a clinically relevant effect 
of alectinib in the proposed patient population. 
The Applicant has also provided data from a pre-planned interim analysis from the alectinib vs. crizotinib 
head to head, Japanese J-ALEX study. The comparative data form the J-ALEX study further supports the 
results from the two main studies [data not shown].  
The Applicant was also requested to provide further data on the NP28673 Part 3. However, only 11 consented 
to an optional biopsy for EGFR testing and none of these were found to harbour an EGFR activating mutation. 
Hence no data on the combination of alectinib and erlotinib is available. As regards to the 44 patients in part 
3 that continued on alectinib monotherapy beyond progression, 33 patients had discontinued alectinib at the 
time of the updated 01 February 2016 cut-off (main reason lack of further clinical benefit [26 patients]). The 
median treatment duration was 3.4 months (range 0 to 22 months, censored). 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The updated information from the phase II studies supporting the ALKi pretreated indication confirm the 
efficacy results initially observed, and provide reassurance on the robustness of these results. The high-level 
comparative data form the Japanese J-ALEX study further supports the results from the two main studies. 
Although a positive benefit-risk profile can be concluded, the data have limitations inherent to the non-
comparative nature of the pivotal studies supporting the recommendation for a conditional MA.  
In order to confirm the positive benefit-risk profile, the applicant will submit the results of the ALEX study, a 
phase 3, two-arm, randomized study, comparing alectinib and crizotinib in the first line. Although this study 
is not in the exact same setting where alectinib is authorised, it will provide comparative efficacy and safety

data for alectinib versus crizotinib. The approval of alectinib in the EU is not expected to impact completion of 
the ALEX study as it is not conducted in the indication being applied for.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The updated results from the two pivotal studies with now a reasonable level of data maturity continue to 
demonstrate a clinically relevant effect of alectinib in the proposed patient population.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of 
a conditional MA: 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of alectinib in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study ALEX comparing alectinib 
versus crizotinib in treatment naïve patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The clinical study report will be 
submitted by 30 April 2018. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary cut-off dates for the MAA were 24 October 2014 and 18 August 2014 for Studies NP28761 and 
NP28673, respectively. This safety update assessment provides cumulative safety data with data cut-off 
dates of 22 January 2016 and 01 February 2016 for Studies NP28761 and NP28673, respectively.  
1. Group 1 includes patients from Phase II of pivotal Study NP28761. 
2. Group 2 includes patients from Phase II of pivotal Study NP28673. 
3. Group 3 includes patients from Phase I and II of Study NP28761 (only patients in Phase I who received 
alectinib at 600 mg twice daily [BID] were included), and Phase II and the midazolam (MDZ) drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) substudy of Study NP28673. 
The safety of Alectinib has been evaluated in 253 patients in pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761, 
NP28673) with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with the recommended dose of 
600 mg twice daily. The median duration of exposure to Alectinib was 11 months.

Patient exposure 
Table 55: Patient Status at Time of Data Cut-off Date for the Safety Update 
About 1/3 of the patients were still on therapy and slightly more than 40% of the patients were dead at time 
of this update meaning that safety data are considered reasonably stable and robust.

Significant adverse events of special interest 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) / pneumonitis 
Severe ILD/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Alectinib. In the pivotal phase II clinical trials 
(NP28761, NP28673), 1 out of 253 patients treated with Alectinib (0.4%) had a Grade 3 ILD. This event led 
to withdrawal from Alectinib treatment. There were no fatal cases of ILD. 
Hepatocellular or Cholestatic Adverse Events and Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
Hepatotoxicity is considered a class effect of ALK inhibitors and has been classified as an important identified 
risk for alectinib. 
In the pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673) two patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT elevations 
had documented drug induced liver injury by liver biopsy. One of these cases led to withdrawal from Alecensa 
treatment. Adverse reactions of increased AST and ALT levels (16% and 14% respectively) were reported in 
patients treated with Alectinib in pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). The majority of these 
events were of Grade 1 and 2 intensity, and events of Grade ≥ 3 were reported in 2.8% and 3.2% of the 
patients, respectively. The events generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment, were usually 
transient and resolved upon temporary interruption of Alectinib treatment (reported for 1.2% and 3.2% of 
the patients, respectively) or dose reduction (1.6% and 0.8%, respectively). In 1.2% and 1.6% of the 
patients, AST and ALT elevations, respectively, led to withdrawal from Alectinib treatment.  
Adverse reactions of bilirubin elevations were reported in 17% of the patients treated with Alectinib in pivotal 
phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). The majority of the events were of Grade 1 and 2 intensity; 
Grade 3 events were reported in 3.2% of the patients. The events generally occurred during the first 3 
months of treatment, were usually transient and resolved upon temporary interruption of Alectinib treatment 
(4.7% of the patients) or dose reduction (2.8%). In 4 patients (1.6%), bilirubin elevations led to withdrawal 
from Alectinib treatment.   
Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater 
than or equal to two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient (0.2%) 
treated in Alectinib clinical trials.

Table 59: Hepatocellular or Cholestatic Damage Adverse Events and Abnormal Liver Function Tests by 
Preferred Term in the Integrated Safety Population in more than one patient (Safety Population) 
Two patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT elevations had documented drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by liver 
biopsy in Group 3: 
 
Patient 1 in Study NP28761: Liver biopsy showed morphological features of autoimmune hepatitis, 
but there was no clear diagnostic evidence of a separate autoimmune hepatitis. Since a similar 
pattern may also be seen secondary to drug, and in the patient's clinical setting, a drug-induced 
hepatitis was favoured as diagnosis. The event let to permanent discontinuation of study drug and 
was considered resolved by Day 53. 
 
Patient 2 in Study NP28673: Ultrasound guided biopsy of the liver performed on Day 222 showed 
centrilobular hepatic injury deemed compliant with a toxic effect and thus indicative for DILI. The 
events of Grade 3 ALT and AST elevations led to study drug interruption on Day 208, and ALT 
elevation finally led to permanent discontinuation on Day 215. The events were considered resolved 
by Day 268. 
In addition  
 
Patient 3 in Study BO28984 (ongoing phase III) was hospitalized with Grade 4 drug induced liver 
injury DILI (considered serious). ALP was within normal range. The patient already had an event of 
increased AST, ALT and bilirubin (up to a maximum of 17 fold, 14 fold and 4.7 fold the ULN, 
respectively), along with subclinical icterus, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and 
increased C-reactive protein approximately 2 weeks before study start. The event of DILI led to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug and was considered resolved by Day120.  
No cases of hepatic failure have been reported. 
Bradycardia 
Cases of bradycardia (7.9%) of Grade 1 or 2 have been reported in patients treated with Alectinib in pivotal 
phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). There were 44 of 221 patients (20%) treated with Alectinib who 
had post-dose heart rate values below 50 beats per minutes. No case of bradycardia led to withdrawal from 
Alectinib treatment. 
Severe myalgia and CPK elevations 
Cases of myalgia (31%) including myalgia events (25%) and musculoskeletal pain (7.5%) have been 
reported in patients treated with Alectinib in pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). The majority 
of events were Grades 1 or 2 and three patients (1.2%) had a Grade 3 event. Dose modifications of Alectinib 
treatment due to these adverse events were only required for two patients (0.8%). Alectinib treatment was 
not withdrawn due to these events of myalgia.  Elevations of CPK occurred in 46% of 219 patients with CPK

laboratory data available in pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673) with Alectinib. The incidence 
of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 5.0%. Median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days. Dose 
modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 4.0% of patients; withdrawal from Alectinib treatment did not 
occur due to CPK elevations.. 
Gastrointestinal effects  
Constipation (36%), nausea (22%), diarrhoea (18%) and vomiting (13%) were the most commonly reported 
gastrointestinal (GI) reactions. Most of these events were of mild or moderate severity; Grade 3 events were 
reported for diarrhea (1.2%), nausea (0.4%), and vomiting (0.4%). These events did not lead to withdrawal 
from Alecensa treatment. Median time to onset for constipation, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting events 
was 18 days. The events declined in frequency after the first month of treatment. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The safety database related to the dose proposed for marketing represents 253 patients with a median 
duration of therapy of approximately 1 year.

Dose modifications or interruptions 
Group 1 
In total, 16 patients (18%) experienced AEs that led to a dose reduction. 
Since the data cutoff date for the SCS, 4 additional patients reported a total of 5 new AEs leading to dose 
reduction of study drug. 
The most common reasons for dose reduction were blood CPK increased (5%), AST increased (3%), and ALT 
increased and blood bilirubin increased (2% each).  
Compared with the SCS, the following new AEs were reported leading to dose reduction: AST increased (1 
patient), ALT increased (1 patient), constipation (1 patient), nausea (1 patient), and oedema peripheral (1 
patient). 
At the time of the data cutoff for the safety update (22 January 2016), the median time to dose reduction 
was 46 days (range: 4−644 days). 
Group 2 
In total, 15 patients (11%) experienced AEs that led to a dose reduction. Since the data cutoff date for the 
SCS, 3 additional patients reported a total of 9 new AEs leading to dose reduction of study drug. 
The most common reasons for dose reduction were blood bilirubin increased (3%), abdominal pain upper 
(1%), and vomiting (1%). Compared with the SCS, the following new AEs were reported leading to dose

reduction: abdominal pain upper (2 patients [1%]), blood bilirubin increased (2 patients [1%]), rash maculo-
papular (1 patient [1%]), and urticaria (1 patient [1%]). 
At the time of the data cutoff for the safety update (01 February 2016), the median time to dose reduction 
was 102.5 days (range: 2−577 days). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Altogether 15 patients (6%) discontinued due to AEs, hepatic laboratory events dominated, but there were 
also single cases of pneumonia, ILD, ligament rupture. 
Data from supportive study 
J-ALEX was a randomised crizotinib comparative trial conducted in Japan. The dose of alectinib was 300 bid 
instead of 600 mg bid. The estimated systemic exposure in this study was about 35% lower than in the 
pivotal trials. This is not likely to have a more than minor impact to safety.

There was no case of death related to AEs.

Table 68: Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database related to the dose proposed for marketing is small (253) but median duration of 
therapy is approximately 1 year. Still the long-term safety of alectinib is not sufficiently characterised and will 
be monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance. The crizotinib comparative trial conducted at a lower dose 
of alectinib (J-ALEX) is considered informative and contextualises the safety profile.  
Almost every patient in the two pivotal studies experienced at least one AE. There are comparable numbers 
of deaths (all cause) and SAEs in the two studies.  
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 20%) were constipation (36%), oedema (34%, 
including oedema peripheral, oedema, generalised oedema, eyelid oedema, periorbital oedema), myalgia 
(31%, including myalgia and musculoskeletal pain) and nausea (22%).   
Cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported in clinical trials with Alectinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Alectinib should be 
immediately interrupted in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and should be permanently discontinued 
if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Gastrointestinal AEs seem to be common. This may be due to the high concentration of SLS in the tablets. 
SLS is a known gastrointestinal irritant that can cause the above mentioned common GI AEs, and these same 
GI AEs are also observed in patients treated with crizotinib. They are clinically manageable and do not pose 
any major concerns. In Group 4 liver related AEs are more common than GI related AEs. Patients in Group 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 108/122 
  
  
 
received only 300 mg BID and thus had a lower exposure to SLS could explain the lower incidence of GI 
related AEs. 
The applicant is recommended to introduce an alternative capsule formulation for oral administration 
containing a lower amount of SLS post-approval. 
Hepatotoxicity is a class effect of ALK-inhibitors, and is also observed in patients treated with crizotinib and 
ceritinib.  
Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 5 times the 
ULN as well as bilirubin elevations of more than 3 times the ULN occurred in patients in pivotal phase II 
clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673) with Alectinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). The majority (76% 
of the patients with hepatic aminotransferase elevations and 60% of the patients with bilirubin elevations) of 
these events occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. In the pivotal phase II clinical trials (NP28761 
and NP28673), two patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT elevations had documented drug induced liver injury by 
liver biopsy. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin 
greater than or equal 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient treated in 
Alectinib clinical trials. 
Liver function, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should be monitored at baseline and then every 2 weeks 
during the first 3 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring should be performed periodically, since events 
may occur later than 3 months, with more frequent testing in patients who develop aminotransferase and 
bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, Alectinib should be withheld and 
resumed at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
Vision disorders were reported in both pivotal and supportive studies. Most common vision disorders are 
blurred vision and visual impairment. All events in Group 3 were of Grade 1 or 2, except for one serious 
Grade 3 event of retinal detachment. 
Myalgia or musculoskeletal pain occurred in 31% of patients in pivotal phase II trials (NP28761, NP28673) 
with Alectinib. The incidence of Grade 3 myalgia/musculoskeletal pain was 1.2%. Dose modifications for 
myalgia/musculoskeletal pain were required in 0.8% of patients. 
Elevations of CPK occurred in 46% of 219 patients with CPK laboratory data available in pivotal phase II trials 
(NP28761, NP28673) with Alectinib. The incidence of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 5.0%. Median time to 
Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days. Dose modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 4.0 % of patients 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be advised to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. CPK levels 
should be assessed every two weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically indicated in patients 
reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, Alectinib should be withheld, then resumed 
or dose reduced (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Symptomatic bradycardia can occur with Alectinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). Heart rate and 
blood pressure should be monitored as clinically indicated. Dose modification is not required in case of 
asymptomatic bradycardia (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia or 
life-threatening events, concomitant medicinal products known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-
hypertensive medicinal products should be evaluated and Alectinib treatment should be adjusted as described 
in sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC (P-gp substrates and BCRP substrates).

Photosensitivity to sunlight has been reported with Alectinib administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking Alectinib, and for at least 
7 days after discontinuation of treatment. Patients should also be advised to use a broad-spectrum Ultraviolet 
A (UVA)/ Ultraviolet B (UVB) sun screen and lip balm (SPF ≥50) to help protect against potential sunburn. 
Alectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential 
must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Alectinib. Female patients of child-bearing potential receiving 
Alectinib, must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 3 months 
following the last dose of Alectinib (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). Female patients, who become 
pregnant while taking Alectinib or during the 3 months following the last dose of Alectinib must contact their 
doctor and should be advised of the potential harm to the foetus. 
It is unknown whether alectinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant 
cannot be excluded. Mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving Alectinib. 
Alectinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be exercised when 
driving or operating machines as patients may experience symptomatic bradycardia (e.g., syncope, dizziness, 
hypotension) or vision disorders while taking Alectinib (see sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, a 
congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
The recommended daily dose (1200 mg) of Alectinib contains 2.1 mmol (or 48 mg) sodium. To be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with Alectinib. Patients who experience overdose should be closely 
supervised and general supportive care instituted. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The submission of the final CSR for the global Phase III comparative alectinib versus crizotinib ALEX study 
will provide more mature safety data in order to further confirm the safety profile of alectinib. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of alectinib is as expected for ALK inhibitors. Hepatotoxicity, anaemia, bradycardia, ILD and 
photosensitivity  are  observed.  However,  QT  interval  prolongation  is  not  observed  in  patients  being  treated 
with alectinib, while it is observed in patients being treated with other ALK inhibitors. The discontinuation rate 
is only 5% and considered relatively low.  
Overall, the safety profile of alectinib is acceptable and in line with other ALK inhibitors. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a 
conditional MA: 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of alectinib in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study ALEX comparing alectinib 
versus crizotinib in treatment naïve patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The clinical study report will be

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of alectinib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers alectinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Alecensa (alectinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as: 
- It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product 
authorised in the EU  
- It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The original proposed indication for alectinib was “adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-
positive, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are 
intolerant to crizotinib”. 
Intolerance to crizotinib as part of the label was questioned by the CHMP and it has been shown that only a 
very limited number of patients were in fact included in the studies based on crizotinib-intolerance (five in 
NP28761, none in NP28673). Consequently, the Applicant has proposed a revision of the indication wording 
to state “Alectinib as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive, 
advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib”. 
For a new ALKi to be used after failure on prior ALKi treatment it is clinically relevant to define whether 
resistance is related to secondary ALK mutations or other mechanisms underlying resistance; a priori activity 
e.g., in case of resistance due to activation of alternative signalling pathways bypassing ALK appears remote. 
Similarly, to what degree the secondary mutation affects the activity of the new compound is of importance. 
Such data are presently available to a very limited and non-informative extent. The applicant is 
recommended to provide final analysis on secondary ALK mutation positive/negative samples and correlation 
with clinical outcome.

EMA/197343/2017 
Page 115/122 
  
  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and represents a major health problem.  
Approximately 5% of patients with NSCLC have tumours that contain an inversion in chromosome 2 that 
juxtaposes the 5' end of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the 3' end of 
the ALK gene, resulting in the novel fusion oncogene EML4-ALK. EML4-ALK fusion, and ALK fusions with other 
genes (Kinesin Family member 5B [KIF5B]), KLC1 and others define a distinct clinicopathologic subset of 
NSCLC.  
Patients with ‘ALK-positive’ tumours (tumours harboring a rearranged ALK gene/fusion protein) tend to have 
specific clinical features, including never or light smoking history, younger age, NSCLC with adenocarcinoma 
histology, and are highly sensitive to therapy with ALK inhibitors. 
ALK positive tumours are addicted to ALK signalling meaning that inhibition leads to rapid cell death and early 
tumour responses. Loss of activity invariably follows and may be related to secondary ALK resistance 
mutations, but also fusion gene amplification and activation of alternative signalling pathways.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
After the licensure of crizotinib and ceritinib, alectinib is the third ALK inhibitor (ALKi) submitted for 
marketing authorisation for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. 
The kinase inhibitory profiles of these compounds are clearly different; alectinib inhibits ALK and RET, 
crizotinib has a broader profile: ALK, ROS1, MET, etc. and ceritinib ALK, ROS1, IGF1R (for details please refer 
to the non-clinical pharmacology section). Of potential clinical relevance for the activity in different tumour 
types/subsets, apart from ALK is inhibition of RET, ROS1, MET and IGF1R, but a broader inhibition profile is 
also of importance from a safety perspective. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant initially applied for full approval for alectinib based on two single arm Phase I/II studies, 
NP28761 (n=87, US/ Canada) and NP28673 (n=138, global) supported by data from a pre-planned interim 
analysis from the 1st line, Japanese, crizotinib comparative study (J-ALEX). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Whilst primary endpoint in both studies was ORR by IRC assessment (RECIST 1.1 with confirmation), 
NP28673 also had a co-primary endpoint of ORR by IRC assessment in patients pre-treated with 
chemotherapy. 
The studies met their primary endpoints with ORR, in the updated analyses; IRC 52 % and 51 % in NP28761 
and NP 28673, respectively. The co-primary endpoint ORR by IRC for the patients pre-treated with 
chemotherapy in NP28673 was 45 %. About 16 % had progressive disease as best response, similar in both 
studies.  
For both pivotal studies, ORR by subgroups (age, gender, race, ECOG PS, CNS metastasis, smoking status, 
baseline body weight, and prior chemotherapy use), were generally consistent with the ORR in the overall 
population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 116/122 
  
  
Updated median PFS was 8.9 months in both studies, at event rates of 67 and 71%. Data are thus highly 
likely to be stable after prolonged follow up. 
Out of the 50 patients with measurable CNS lesions in the overall efficacy population, the overall response 
rate was 64%, thereof CR in 22% (IRC). 
In the supportive Japanese study J-ALEX in ALKi naïve patients alectinib 300 mg BID was compared with 
crizotinib in the EU licensed dose. In the interim anaysis at event rates of 24% vs. 56% the PFS HR was 0.34 
(p<0.0001)(IRC) and response rates were 92% vs. 79%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The major uncertainty in the assessment of optimised benefit of alectinib is absence of informative data on 
mechanisms underlying resistance to crizotinib; secondary ALK resistance mutations, fusion gene 
amplification and activation of alternative signalling pathways as such data may guide the proper use of 
alectinib in the now targeted indication.  
Out of 225 patients enrolled in the studies, baseline plasma samples were available from 178 individuals and 
now data are presented from 49 samples.  
Based on the existence of alternative mechanisms of resistance unlikely to be responsive to alectinib therapy, 
a higher ORR would be expected in case of tumours with secondary ALK mutation positive samples, but ORR 
was similar (1/3) in patients with ALK mutation positive and negative liquid samples and apparently lower 
than in the full study population (1/2). Whether the analysed 49 samples are representative for the full study 
population could obviously be questioned and the sensitivity of liquid biopsies to detect tumour tissue 
mutations is unknown and circulating tumour DNA may relate to tumour burden/invasiveness.  
Of some interest, PD as best response was more commonly reported in patients with ALK mutation negative 
samples than ALK mutation positive samples (12/35 vs. 2/21).  
Patients with CNS progression only should have been excluded from the group of patients with mutation 
negative liquid biopsies due to the postulated poorer uptake of crizotinib in CNS metastases. This will not be 
further pursued at this stage.  
Available data cannot be used to guide the use of alectinib, second line to crizotinib.   
The final study report on secondary ALK-mutation positive/negative samples and correlation with clinical 
outcome should be submitted (please refer to Section 7 Proposed list of recommendation). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Tolerability is considered possible to estimate with reasonable certainty at the dose proposed for marketing, 
even though the number of patients is low, roughly 250 individuals treated for a for median about 1 year.  
The most common side effects are constipation, oedema (including peripheral oedema, generalised oedema, 
eyelid oedema, periorbital oedema), myalgia (including myalgia and musculoskeletal pain) and nausea. 
Tolerability in terms of discontinuations (6%, related or not) and dose reductions (about 15%, mainly 
laboratory events among likely related) are considered favourable when contextualised. This refers not only 
to ALKi but to anti-cancer therapy in general.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 117/122 
  
  
Hepatic events and CPK/myalgia events need to monitored in clinical practice and proper guidance is 
provided in the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Events such as pulmonary embolism and haemorrhages always occur in patients with advanced malignancies, 
including ALK+NSCLC. Whether treatment with alectinib increases or decreases the risk cannot be assessed, 
but good control of the underlying disease should decrease the disease related event rate.  
As only single arm or active, reference controlled trials are possible, the absolute risk increase or decrease 
cannot be assessed. The Japanese, first-line, crizotinib comparative trial is considered informative and 
indicates a favourable safety profile, with the caveat that the dose of alectinib was lower (estimated exposure 
reduced about 35%). The only signal of increased toxicity related to alectinib was myalgia/CPK increase.  
There is another ongoing first-line, crizotinib comparative trial at the “EU dose”.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Available clinical data illustrate the likely benefit of targeting the driver mutation of the malignancy only. Very 
high activity in terms of ORR and superior PFS compared with crizotinib has thus been reported in the first-
line J-ALEX trial. This is interpreted as indicative of anti-tumour activity not being restricted by dose limiting 
side effects not related to inhibition of ALK (and RET). It is easily understood why the Applicant views the 
currently proposed indication as a first step only, with an ongoing comparative study versus crizotinib at the 
EU recommended dose. In this context it is of interest to notice that fold change in relation to the wild type 
translocation is similar to fold change for crizotinib for crizotinib resistance related mutations.   
The reported benefit in terms of ORR and PFS after failure on crizotinib is considered clinically meaningful. 
Actually, it has been shown that tumour responses at much lower rates than 50% are associated with 
measurable symptomatic benefit in clinical studies. Similarly, delayed progression by imaging is associated 
with delayed symptomatic progression of similar magnitude. This means that treatment with alectinib is 
highly likely to provide symptomatic benefit on a group level. At the reported high frequency of tumour 
responses in case of brain metastases, symptomatic benefit is expected also in this group of patients, very 
commonly encountered in ALK+ NSCLC.  
Reported adverse reactions are considered manageable and reversible and unlikely to affect the tolerability of 
the product in more than a small proportion of patients. There are obvious caveats in relation to hepatic and 
muscular events and, by convention, ILD. Proper guidance is provided in the SmPC. 
To contextualise, the ORR is of similar magnitude to that reported for ceritinib after crizotinib failure. Despite 
brain metastases in a high proportion of patients in the ceritinib studies, only 11 patients had brain 
metastasis assigned as target lesions resulting in poor estimates of ORR: 45.5% (95% CI: 16.7, 76.6) 
Assessment report

(EPAR). Selection “bias” should also be taken into account when small proportions of lesions are assigned as 
target lesions. 
It should also be noticed that tumours addicted to a driver mutation tend to show higher response rates to 
conventional chemotherapy. In the confirmatory crizotinib study, second-line to chemotherapy, the response 
rate in patients treated with pemetrexed or docetaxel was 20% (vs. 65% in the crizotinib arm). 
Altogether benefit clearly outweighs the risk in the target population. As activity is unlikely in case of 
resistance to crizotinib if related to signalling bypassing ALK, there is likely room to improve B/R by proper 
patient selection. This issue may not be possible to resolve within this procedure, and should be a post 
approval commitment. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefit-risk is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Alectinib has shown a clinically relevant ORR rate in patients that have previously been treated with 
crizotinib. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was proposed 
by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The CHMP considered that ALECENSA falls under the scope of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
507/2006 as eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as it belongs to: 
b) Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously 
debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. The ORR of 51-52% obtained with alectinib in pivotal studies is 
significant in patients with relapsed and refractory ALK+ NSCLC, whose prior therapy included crizotinib. 
Together with an acceptable safety-profile in patients in the proposed indication, the benefit-risk balance 
is considered positive. 
 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant will provide 
further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of alectinib in the proposed indication. 
More specifically the applicant will provide: 
 Study ALEX, a phase 3, two-arm, randomized study, comparing alectinib and crizotinib in the first 
line.  
This phase 3 study is not in the exact same setting where alectinib is authorised, but it will provide 
comparative efficacy and safety data for alectinib versus crizotinib. 
 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. In view of the positive benefit-risk balance, alectinib fulfils an 
Assessment report  
EMA/197343/2017 
Page 120/122 
  
  
unmet medical need for patients with poor long-term prognosis and limited treatment alternatives. 
Although alectinib has not a new mechanism of action, the safety profile is manageable, and treatment 
with alectinib was associated with high ORR and durable responses in patients with CNS metastases. In 
this context it should be noted that ceritinib (Zykadia) licensed in the same indication as currently 
applied for by the Applicant (i.e. after prior crizotinib treatment), is conditionally approved at the time of 
the CHMP opinion. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required.  
In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the high ORR, especially in patients with CNS metastases, 
the immediate availability of Alecensa on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Alecensa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Alecensa is favourable in the following indication: 
Alecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

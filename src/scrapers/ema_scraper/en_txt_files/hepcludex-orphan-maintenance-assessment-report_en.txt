2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 was based on the 
following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing synthetic 47-amino-acid 
N-myristoylated lipopeptide, derived from the preS region of hepatitis B virus was considered 
justified based on preliminary clinical data in patients affected by the condition where treatment 
with the product resulted in reduced HDV RNA levels;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the development of cirrhosis, 
portal hypertension and liver insufficiency; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
As a satellite virus of HBV, HDV infects humans either concomitantly with or after HBV infection (as a 
superinfection). This is because the latter supplies the propagation mechanism from coating to delivery 
of the virion to the hepatocyte, but HDV genome replication and formation of a nucleocapsid-like 
ribonucleoprotein are independent of HBV (Surreau and Negro, J Hepatol. 2016 Apr;64:S102-S11). 
The clinical manifestations range from acute liver failure to the inactive carrier state with most cases of 
superinfection commonly evolving to chronic HDV infection and hepatitis. 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 
plasma (or serum) HDV-RNA positive adult patients with compensated liver disease” falls entirely 
within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of hepatitis delta virus infection”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility is accepted on the basis of the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the chronically debilitating and life-threatening nature of 
the condition since the designation stage. 
Clinically, hepatitis delta is considered the most severe viral hepatitis (Lempp and Urban, Nature 
Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology 2016, 13: 580–589). In case of co-infection, the rate of 
progression to chronicity is between 2 and 5%, but for superinfection, chronicity rates are above 80%. 
Importantly, the chronic form of hepatitis D is the most severe and rapidly progressive chronic

hepatitis, leading to cirrhosis in approximately 70% within 10 years. Up to 2 years after the episode of 
acute HDV, 15% of patients develop cirrhosis. The risk of developing cirrhosis is 3 times higher in an 
HDV infection than in an HBV mono-infection (Botelho Souza et al, Virol J. 2017; 14: 177). Moreover, 
it has been reported that in patients with compensated cirrhosis, HDV infection increases the risk for 
Hepatocellular carcinoma by threefold and for mortality by twofold (Gut. 2000 Mar; 46(3): 420–426). 
It is acknowledged that the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening in particular due to 
the development of hepatocellular cancer, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and liver insufficiency. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor initially proposed an estimate of 0.4 per 10,000, derived from hepatitis B cases, by 
assuming 1-2% HDV infection rate. The Committee noted that such an estimate would fall short of its 
previous considerations by a factor of about 10-fold, and that publications give higher infection rates 
among HBV carriers, e.g. a 2018 publication by Aguilera et al cites a less than 5% rate is noted (Eur J 
Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2018 Sep;30(9):1060-1062). It was also considered that in a recently 
published meta-analysis by Miao et al (Journal of infectious diseases, published online November 2019) 
the prevalence of HDV was considerably higher that the proposed estimate (0.09% prevalence in the 
general population in Europe, and much higher in other European regions). 
In light of those concerns, and in order to ensure that the prevalence orphan criterion is respected, the 
sponsor was invited to justify the assumptions used in the calculation, taking into consideration the 
entire population affected by hepatitis D. A recalculation and sensitivity analysis of all assumptions 
used was requested by the sponsor.  
In response, the sponsor refuted the relevance of the publication by Miao and colleagues on the 
grounds of dates of references (with some dating back to 30 years ago) and potential publication bias. 
The sponsor also defended its position by adding a sensitivity analysis of the assumptions and 
proposing an estimation of up to 4.7 per 10,000 as a worst-case scenario. During the oral presentation 
a Monte Carlo simulation was presented, the results of which remained below the statutory prevalence 
threshold.  
The methodology used relied on the assumption that because HDV co-infection generally leads to more 
aggressive course of the disease, HDV rates among HBV infected individuals are higher in “high-risk” 
groups who are likely to attend tertiary centres, compared to “low-risk” HBV groups.  
The following main assumptions were used in detail:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the number of HBV cases was considered to be approximately 1%, on the basis of literature used 
the orphan designation stage but also supported by more recent publications such as Hofstraat et 
al, (Epidemiol. Infect 2017; 145, 2873–2885); 
approximately 15% of HBsAg carriers were assumed to belong to high-risk population while 85% 
were non-severely affected cases (Villa et al, 2011 Dig Liver Dis. 2011 Jan;43 Suppl 1:S8-14.); 
for the patients in “high risk” populations, who are likely to attend tertiary centres, a mean of 8% 
HDV prevalence in HBsAg carriers was assumed (ranging across several countries and sources);  
for the rest of HBsAg carriers, 2% HDV prevalence was assumed based on blood donor studies 
(Rosenberg et al. 2013 Transfusion 53(10Pt2); 2467-2476, Servant-Delmas et al. 2014 J Clinic 
Virol 59(2) 126-128;).

The sponsor proposed a 2.9 conclusion with confidence intervals of 1.6 to 4.7 per 10,000. The COMP 
accepted a less than 4.7 per 10,000 estimate for the purpose of this procedure. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
No authorised products have been identified by the sponsor. The most widely used, albeit off label, 
drug is pegylated interferon-α but only approximately 25% of patients maintain a sustained viral 
response after 1 year of treatment (Botelho Souza et al, Virol J. 2017; 14: 177). 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable in the absence of authorised products indicated for hepatitis Delta. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 29 May 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus infection (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 4.7 in 10,000 persons 
in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the development of cirrhosis, 
portal hypertension, liver insufficiency and hepatocellular carcinoma; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of hepatitis delta that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Hepcludex, synthetic 47-amino 
acid N-myristoylated lipopeptide, derived from the preS region of hepatitis B virus, bulevirtide for 
treatment of hepatitis delta virus infection (EU/3/15/1500) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

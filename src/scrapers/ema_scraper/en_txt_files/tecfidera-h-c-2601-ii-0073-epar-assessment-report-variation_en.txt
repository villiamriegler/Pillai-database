3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
3.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Paediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severe chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of 
the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal 
destruction, with marked impact on patients’ life and development, and leading to disability early in life. 
Although MS is predominantly a disease of young adults, approximately 3% to 5% of people with MS 
have their first symptoms in childhood. Genetic, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and cell-based studies largely 
support a shared biology between paediatric-onset and adult-onset disease. Relapses are more frequent 
in  patients  with  paediatric-onset  compared  with  adult-onset  MS.  Cognitive  impairment  in  paediatric 
patients with multiple sclerosis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of global and focal loss 
of age-expected brain volume have been described. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The  therapeutic  indication  has  been  revised  to  exclude  patients  aged  10  to  <13 years  following  the 
Applicant’s responses to the request for supplementary information:  
“Tecfidera is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 13 years and older 
with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).” 
Epidemiology  
Approximately  3-5%  of  all  patients  with  MS  experience  their  first  attack  before  the  age  of  18  years 
(Belman  et  al.  2016).  MS  onset  before  10  years  of  age  is  rare  with  less  than  1%  of  MS  patients 
experiencing their first attack before the age of 10. Hence, the overall prevalence estimates for paediatric 
MS are low, ranging from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 (Gadoth 2003, Pohl et al 2007, Renoux et al 2007, 
Chitnis et al 2009, Waldman et al 2016). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact aetiology of MS remains unknown, it is generally assumed that MS is mediated by an 
immune-mediated inflammatory process that is triggered by environmental factors and superimposed 
on a genetic predisposition. The major contributors to this process are macrophages and microglia from 
the  innate  immune  system,  and  T  and  B  lymphocytes  from  the  adaptive  immune  system.  From  the 
peripheral immune system, autoreactive T-helper cells are primed and stimulated to infiltrate the CNS 
where they target myelin antigens. Inflammation of the white and grey matter tissues in the CNS due 
to focal immune cell infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS 
not  only  to  the  myelin  sheath  but  also  to  the  underlying  axons.  This  process  happens  over  time  and 
results in repeated attacks. Demyelination and axonal damage impairs or interrupts nerve transmission, 
giving rise to clinical signs and symptoms. B and T  cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic

cells  are  all  involved  in  any  stage  of  MS.  Neuropathology  studies  have  found  that  the  patterns  of 
inflammation are very similar between relapsing and progressive MS. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
As  in  adults,  a  diagnosis  of  MS  in  paediatric  patients  is  made  based  on  clinical  and  MRI  features. 
According  to  the  consensus  definition  proposed  by  the  International  Paediatric  MS  Study  Group 
(IPMSSG),  a  diagnosis  of  MS  in  paediatric  patients  requires  multiple  episodes  of  CNS  demyelination 
separated  in  time  and  space  (Krupp  et  al  2013).  Symptomatic  overlap  with  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis  (ADEM)  and  the  increased  chance  of  leukodystrophies  and  metabolic  disorders, 
complicates the differential diagnosis of paediatric-onset MS relative to adult onset MS (Venkateswaran 
and Banwell 2010, Krupp et al 2013). 
The initial course of MS is more often relapsing (-remitting) (RRMS) in paediatric-onset MS (>98%) than 
in adult-onset (approximately 85%) (Waldman et al 2016). The relapse rate in paediatric MS is reported 
to  be  2-3  times  higher  than  in  adult-onset  MS  (Weinshenker  et  al  1989a,  Weinshenker  et  al  1989b, 
Trojano et al 2002, Yeh et al 2009, Benson et al 2014, Waldman et al 2016). Although MRI features in 
paediatric  MS  are  less  well  described,  available  data  show  that the underlying  pathology  is  similar  to 
adult relapsing MS. Children, however, tend to have a higher number of T2 lesions at the time of first 
event than adults (Waubant et al 2009) and a lower propensity for lesions to enhance with gadolinium 
(Gd) (Banwell et al 2007). A consistent finding in most of the paediatric cohort studies is lower disability 
scores in paediatric MS compared to adult MS, even when disease duration is taken into account. In the 
paediatric  cohort  described  by  Renoux  et  al  2007,  the  estimated  median  times  from  onset  to  the 
assignment  of  Disability  Status  Scale  scores  of  4,  6  and  7  were  20  years,  29  years  and  37  years, 
respectively.  Compared  to  the  adult-onset  population,  the  time  to  expanded  disability  status  scale 
(EDSS) scores of 4, 6 and 7 were approximately 10 years longer for patients with paediatric-onset MS. 
Similarly, and in line with this slower progression of disability, the conversion to secondary progressive 
MS took approximately 10 years longer in paediatric MS than in adult patients, occurring at a median of 
28.1 years after the first attack of paediatric MS compared to 18.8 years for adult-onset patients. The 
median age of the person at SPMS onset was 41 years in paediatric patients with MS vs 52 years in adult 
MS (~10 years earlier in paediatric patients vs. adult MS). 
Paediatric  MS  accounts  for  approximately  3%  to  5%  of  MS  cases 1 2345 678 and  the  incidence  increases 
with age (the majority of cases occur at or after the age of 10 years). The high number of relapses in 
the first years of the disease and the high frequency of paediatric patients with the relapsing-remitting

course  suggest  that  the  inflammatory  process  is  more  pronounced  in  children  with  MS  compared  to 
adults91011. 
In paediatric patients with MS, current consensus is to initiate pharmacological treatment shortly after 
diagnosis,  even  though  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  most  therapies  available  for  adults  have  not  been 
formally demonstrated in children1213. 
Management 
As of the date of this document, only fingolimod and teriflunomide are explicitly approved in the EU for 
use in children 10 years of age and over. While fingolimod is restricted to patients with highly active 
relapsing remitting MS, teriflunomide is indicated for relapsing remitting MS without restriction.  
Limited  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the  paediatric  population  have  been  collected  for  the  use  of 
conventional injectable therapies in adolescents ≥12 years of age. Three interferon-beta (IFN β) agents 
(two IFN β 1a and one IFN β 1b) and glatiramer acetate (GA) are allowed to be used in paediatric patients 
with  MS  according  to  the  dosage  and  administration  sections  of  the  EU  summary  of  product 
characteristics (SmPC). 
3.1.2.  About the product 
Tecfidera (synonyms: dimethyl fumarate [DMF], BG00012) received approval of a European Union (EU) 
Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA)  from the European Commission (centralised procedure) on 
30 January 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Tecfidera 
is distributed in 120 mg and 240 mg hard gelatine capsules. The starting dose is 120 mg two times a 
day orally. After 7 days, the Tecfidera dose is proposed to be 240 mg twice daily (BID) (480 mg DMF 
per day). Temporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice a day is foreseen and may reduce the occurrence 
of  flushing  and  gastrointestinal  (GI)  side  effects.  Within  1  month,  the  recommended  dose  of  240 mg 
twice a day orally should be resumed. 
In paediatric patients (13 years of age and above), the recommended dose is the same as in adults. 
The mechanism by which DMF exerts therapeutic effects in MS is not fully understood. However, together 
with its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF), it acts to promote both anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective responses in peripheral and CNS resident cells and tissues. Non-clinical studies indicate 
that DMF pharmacodynamic (PD) responses appear to be mediated, at least in part, through stimulation 
of Nuclear factor (erythroid 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional activity in the response to oxidative 
stress. DMF has been shown to up regulate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes in patients (e.g. NAD(P)H 
dehydrogenase, quinone 1; [NQO1]).

CHMP 
The PIP for DMF (Tecfidera) was first approved by the EMA on 18 February 2011 (EMEA-000832-PIP01-
10)  for  the  indication  targeted  “treatment  of  relapsing  remitting  forms  of  multiple  sclerosis”.  In  the 
original  PIP,  a  24-week,  double-blind  (DB),  placebo-controlled  study  (part  1),  followed  by  a  24  week 
safety  extension  in  which  all  patients  will  receive  BG00012  (part  2)  was  chosen  by  the  Applicant  to 
demonstrate  efficacy  whilst  minimizing  the  required  number  of  patients  due  to  expected  recruitment 
difficulties. The proposed primary endpoint was “the total number of new Gd-enhancing lesions over 4 
MRI  scans”.  However,  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  requested  modifications  by  the  Applicant, 
amongst  others,  that the  comparator  should  be  an  active  control  rather  than placebo.  Hereupon,  the 
Applicant provided two new proposals with regard to the clinical study design. 
However,  neither  of  two  study  design options  proposed  by  the  Applicant  were  deemed  acceptable  by 
PDCO. A placebo-controlled design was rejected because a (albeit rather weak) standard of care existed 
in the form of the IFN β. With regard to the second proposal, an active-controlled, pre-post study design 
there were concerns regarding adequate demonstration of efficacy. The usefulness of a total number of 
6 Gd- MRIs to be performed within a period of 7-8 months which would be needed to assess the primary 
endpoint was also felt to be ethically debatable.  
Therefore, PDCO requested that the study to be conducted is a two year open-label, randomised, parallel-
group study of DMF vs. IFN β 1a, with a primary endpoint of proportion of patients free of new/newly 
enlarging T2 MRI lesions at 24 months, and secondary efficacy endpoints being the proportion of patients 
free of new/newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions at 12 months, the proportion of patients free of new MRI 
activity (free of Gd-enhanced and free of new/newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions) at 12 and 24 months, 
time to first relapse, and proportion of patients free of relapse up to 24 months. Further safety follow-
up of up to 5 years is to be foreseen.  
Essential requests for modification of the agreed PIP were applied by the MAH and subsequently the PIP 
has been modified in agreement with the PDCO: 
•  Modification 01, issued 26 February 2013, decision No. P/0027/2013 
•  Modification 02, issued 10 July 2015, decision No. P/0144/2015 
•  Modification 03, issued 20 May 2016 decision No. P/0132/2016 
•  Modification 04, issued 30 June 2017 decision No. P/0167/2017 
•  Modification 05 issued 15 May 2020 decision No. P/0177/2020 
PIP  modifications  01  and  05  consisted  of  administrative  changes  to  the  timelines  specified  within  the 
PIP. Modification 02 consisted of changes to the inclusion criteria in regard to the washout period required 
for treatments taken prior to the start of the study. Modification 03 consisted of separating Part 2 of the 
study, the follow-up extension study, from Part 1 of the study. Modification 04 was to remove the PK 
element of the PIP, as this aspect of the PIP was fulfilled separately within Study 109MS202. Further, 
the number of requested children aged 10 to less than 13 years was reduced from at least 20 to at least 
10 children due to recruitment difficulties. The requirement was removed that a proportion of patients 
must be pre-pubertal at screening. Instead, the Applicant was requested to establish pubertal status of 
the  patients  at  the  time  of  the  initiation  of  symptoms  (retrospectively)  and  to  perform  an  additional, 
separate efficacy analysis based on pubertal status at disease initiation. The 4-weeks washout period for 
GA and IFN β was removed. Instead, stratification of randomization of subjects by whether or not they 
had received therapy with IFN ß-1a or GA in the 4 weeks prior to study entry was added. 
Two nonclinical studies of DMF in juvenile rats have been conducted to support the clinical studies and 
the paediatric indication. The MAH committed to include these studies in the application for a paediatric

indication  (EMEA/H/C/2601/II/0061/G).  Study  P00012-14-02:  An  Oral  (Gavage)  Toxicity  Study  of 
Dimethyl Fumarate in Juvenile Rats, which was required as part of the PIP, and Study P00012-12-02: 
Toxicity Study of BG00012 when Administered Orally in Juvenile Male Rats (see Module 2.4 Nonclinical 
Overview). 
The commercial formulation of Tecfidera, as used in adults, is proposed for dosing paediatric patients, 
and this formulation was used for the paediatric clinical studies. The PIP included the option of opening 
the  capsules  to  facilitate  the  administration  of  the  micro  tablets  on  food  as  an  alternative  means  of 
dosing for the paediatric participants. This option was not needed during the clinical studies; therefore, 
no changes to the adult commercial formulation were proposed for paediatric patients. 
3.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The  two  juvenile  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  which  had  been  previously  evaluated  by  the  CHMP  and  are 
discussed  in  this  type II  variation  with  regard  to  the  proposed  extension  of  the  clinical  indication  to 
paediatric patients, complied with good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations (study nos. P00012-14-02 
and P00012-12-02). It should be noted, however, that the bone densitometry performed in study no. 
P00012-14-02 was excluded from GLP compliance and only met general scientific standards. 
The  clinical  trial  was  performed  in  accordance  with  good  clinical  practice  (GCP)  as  claimed  by  the 
Applicant. It is stated that the study also meets the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, and/or, 
where applicable, the European Directive 2001/20 in relation to GCP in the conduct of clinical trials on 
medicinal products for human use and Directive 2005/28 on GCP for investigational medicinal products 
for human use. No serious breaches of GCP occurred during the study. 
3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
In order to support the proposed extension of the indication of DMF to paediatric RRMS patients aged 
10 years and above, the MAH had earlier conducted two toxicity studies in juvenile rats, which had been 
evaluated  by  the  CHMP  in  type II  variation  procedures  in  2016  (study  no.  P00012-1402; 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/25) and 2019 (study no. P00012-1202; EMEA/H/C/2601/II/61/G), respectively. At 
the time of the evaluation of both investigations, CHMP had concluded that their outcome would have to 
be reconsidered upon extension of the clinical indication to paediatric patients. The essential findings of 
both studies are briefly reported below (please see assessment reports of the abovementioned variation 
procedures for further details). 
3.2.2.  Toxicology 
Juvenile toxicity studies 
Juvenile toxicity study of DMF in rats (study no. P00012-14-02) 
DMF was administered once daily by oral gavage at doses of 5, 15, 50 and 140 mg/kg/day in vehicle 
(0.8 %  hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  from  postnatal  day  (PND) 28  to  PND 93  to  male  and  female 
juvenile rats (n=35/sex/group). One subset of animals of 15 males and females per group was sacrificed 
on PND 94, whereas the second subset of 20 males and females per group continued the study in an 
8 week  recovery  period  and  were  evaluated  for  reproductive  capacity.  The  plasma  exposure  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 12/152 
 
 
 
assessed by means of determination of the principal active metabolite MMF at the end of the treatment 
period  (PND 93;  13 weeks  of  age)  and,  hence,  concerned  fully  mature  and  adult,  but  not  juvenile 
animals. 
No effects of DMF on development, behaviour or reproductive performance of the F0 juvenile rats were 
noted.  In  addition,  no  effects  on  the  male  or  female  reproductive  organs  and  no  impact  on  the  F1 
offspring up to PND 4 were detected (litter size, gender proportion and postnatal survival/growth). 
Prominent toxicities were observed in the non-glandular stomach and in the kidneys of the F0 generation 
as previously observed in other multiple dose toxicity studies in adult animals submitted for MAA of DMF. 
Significant changes in bone densitometry in the vertebrae and femur (reduced bone mineral density and 
content) was evident in F0 juvenile male rats administered the 140 mg/kg/day DMF high dose, which 
was attributed to the diminished food consumption of these animals resulting in malnutrition due to the 
established non-glandular stomach toxicity of DMF. 
Toxicity study of DMF in juvenile male rats (study no. P00012-12-02) 
In  view  of  the  decreased  weights  of  testes  and  epididymis,  degeneration  of  seminiferous  tubular 
epithelium and hypospermia in the epididymis in male dogs treated with 25 mg/kg/day in the chronic 
toxicity  study  (study  no.  P00012-05-05)  as  well  as  Leydig  cell  hyperplasia  and  adenoma  at  doses 
≥100 mg/kg/day DMF in the 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats (study no. P00012-04-11), higher oral 
gavage  doses  of  50,  140  and  375 mg/kg/day  DMF  had  been  investigated  in  juvenile  male  rats  from 
PND 28 to 92 as part of a PIP requirement of “Tecfidera” (EMEA/247744/2011). The dosing phase was 
followed by an 8 week recovery period. The dose-related plasma MMF exposure was confirmed after first 
DMF administration on PND 28 and at the end of the treatment phase on PND 90-92 without consistent 
evidence for accumulation. 
The  DMF-related  adverse  effects  on  food  consumption/body  weight,  serum  clinical  chemistry  and 
urinalysis parameters as well as stomach and kidneys mirrored those observed in male and female rats 
of the same age in the initial juvenile toxicity study (study no. P00012-14-02) as well as in adult rats. 
Moreover,  no  histopathological  changes  of  male  reproductive  organs  were  found  (testes,  epididymis, 
pituitary, prostate or seminal vesicles). The observed delay of preputial separation in the juvenile animals 
was attributed to their reduced body weight/food consumption consequent to the adverse impact of DMF 
on the non-glandular stomach rather than a hormonal effect. The collected blood samples were therefore 
not  analysed  for  inhibin-B,  Luteinizing  hormone,  Follicle-stimulating  hormone  and  testosterone  as 
originally planned. 
3.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH provided an updated Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) based on the European guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 and corresponding EMA Q&A document. The original ERA was submitted with 
the initial MAA. Due to the proposed extension of the target patient group to children from 10 years of 
age and older, the MAH updated the PECsurfacewater calculation and consequently the corresponding 
risk characterisations. No risks to the environment have been identified by the MAH due to the suggested 
more extensive clinical use. 
For PEC refinement, the MAH adjusted the Fpen by consulting worst case prevalence data of RRMS from 
the  MS  International  Federation  (https://www.atlasofms.org/map/global/epidemiology/number-of-
people-with-ms).  Worst  case  prevalence  for  MS  has  been  found  in  Germany  with  303 cases  per 
100,000 inhabitants  of  which  85 %  account  for  RRMS.  The  adjusted  Fpen  of  0.00258  is  considered 
plausible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 13/152 
 
 
 
According to the adjusted Fpen, the MAH calculated a refined PECsurfacewater of 0.93 µg/l. The refined 
PECsurfacewater  exceeds  the  trigger  of  0.1 µg/l  for  a  Phase II  Tier A  assessment,  which  had  already 
been conducted in the original ERA. Therefore, only recalculation of risk quotients was necessary for the 
update of the Phase II Tier A assessment. 
Considering the updated, refined PECsurfacewater the RQs for surfacewater and microorganisms have 
shown to be <1. Therefore, no risk to the environment is to be expected from the proposed extension 
of the patient group to children from 10 years of age and older. 
3.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Two  toxicity  studies  in  juvenile  rats  with  oral  DMF  administration  up  to  140 mg/kg/day  (study  no. 
P00012-14-02) or up to 375 mg/kg/day (study no. P00012-12-02) from PND 28 to PND92/93 had been 
earlier  submitted  by  the  MAH  that  were  evaluated  by  the  CHMP  in  2016  and  2019,  respectively 
(EMEA/H/C/2601/II/25; EMEA/H/C/2601/II/61/G). The age of the study animals corresponded to human 
children of approximately 3 years and older (see reviews by Kimmel CA and Buelke-Sam J. In Patty’s 
Toxicology.  J. Wiley  &  Sons,  5th Ed.,  Vol. I,  Chap. 3,  2001;  Kim NN  et al.,  Int J  Toxicol.  2017;  36(4): 
325-339). At the time of assessment of these juvenile toxicity studies, DMF therapy was restricted to 
adult RRMS patients. The CHMP had therefore concluded that the study outcomes would be evaluated 
anew upon extension of the MA to a paediatric study population. 
In  both  juvenile  toxicity  studies,  systemic  DMF-related  toxicities  predominantly  comprised  dose-
dependently  impaired  food  consumption/body  weight  due  to  the  impact  of  DMF  on  the  non-glandular 
stomach. The adverse findings in the non-glandular stomach had been previously accepted by the CHMP 
as  rodent-specific,  because  this  organ  lacks  a  clear  anatomical  counterpart  in  other  species  including 
humans. 
In addition, nephrotoxicity was evident in in the juvenile animals, which had been earlier identified in 
other species (adult rats, mice, dogs and monkeys) and correlates with the common proteinuria known 
from DMF therapy of adult RRMS patients. Given the same dose regimen for paediatric RRMS patients 
as  in  adults  and the  lack of  any  safety  margin  with  respect to human  exposure  at  the  recommended 
therapeutic dose, the warning for routine monitoring of renal function in section 4.4 of the current SmPC 
of “Tecfidera” is applicable for both adult and paediatric patient populations. 
The second juvenile toxicity was performed to fulfil a PIP requirement, because diminished weights of 
testes  and  epididymides,  degeneration  of  seminiferous  tubular  epithelia  and  hypospermia  had  been 
previously found in male dogs treated with 25 mg/kg/day DMF in the chronic toxicity study (study no. 
P00012-05-05) and Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenoma were unveiled at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day DMF 
in the 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats (study no. P00012-04-11). Consequently, higher DMF dosages 
up  to  375 mg/kg/day  were  tested  only  in  male  juvenile  rats-(study  no.  P00012-12-02).  Still,  no 
histological  impairments  of  male  reproductive  organs  were  apparent.  Nevertheless,  the  preputial 
separation  was  delayed  in  the  juvenile  rats,  which  was  ascribed  to  their  lower  body  weight/food 
consumption. 
A direct hormonal effect of DMF seems unlikely given the normal fertility of adult male rats up to the 
same  highest  dose  of  375 mg/kg/day  and  the  lack  of  testis  findings  in  the  chronic  toxicity  study  in 
monkeys (study nos. P00012-04-03 and P00012-05-08 assessed during MAA of Tecfidera”). Similar to 
the attenuated preputial separation in juvenile rats, the changes in testes and epididymis of male dogs 
of the chronic toxicity study had been therefore related to the reduced body weight due to lower food 
consumption  of  the  study  animals,  considering  additionally  that  dogs  had  required  extra  dietary 
supplementation.  The  testis  findings  in  dogs  developed  at  a  3-fold  safety  margin  with  respect  to  the 
recommended therapeutic administration in humans.

Changes in testicular Leydig cells were neither detected in both juvenile toxicity studies, nor in any other 
repeated-dose  toxicity  study  of  DMF.  Nonetheless,  increased  incidences  of  Leydig  cell  adenoma  in 
association  with  degenerations  of  seminiferous  tubules  in  the  testes  and  hypospermia  in  the 
epididymides were also determined in the 2 year carcinogenicity study of diroximel fumarate (DRF), a 
related  fumarate  ester  of  the  same  Applicant  whose  MAA  is  currently  reviewed  by  the  CHMP 
(EMEA/H/C/5437; “Vumerity”). As the pharmacological activity of both, DMF and DRF, is conveyed via 
MMF, a causal relationship of the testis changes with DMF treatment cannot be excluded. Accordingly, 
the testicular Leydig cell adenoma observed with DMF have been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Moreover, significantly lower bone mineral density and content in vertebrae and femur was evident in 
juvenile male rats treated with the 140 mg/kg/day DMF high dose in study no. P00012-14-02. No bone 
effects  were  discovered  in  juvenile  male  rats  at  higher  DMF  doses  up  to  375 mg/kg/day  (study  no. 
P00012-12-02), which did not include bone densitometry scans. However, decreased bone mineralisation 
was  similarly  observed  in  both  genders  of  juvenile  rats  at  ≥150 mg/kg/day  DRF  administered  from 
PND 25 to 63 (study no. AT-5108-38; EMEA/H/C/5437; “Vumerity”). The MAH attributed the reduced 
bone mineralisation to the potential malnutrition of the study animals due to the lower food consumption, 
although the decreased bone mass and density and/or bone geometry at the mid- or distal diaphysis in 
juvenile rats administered the 600 mg/kg/day DRF high dose indicated a direct effect on bone growth. 
It should be noted that physeal dysplasia due to hypertrophy and disorganization of chondrocytes were 
detected in the proximal and distal femur as well as proximal tibia during necropsy in 5 out of 6 monkeys 
of  the  91 days  subchronic  toxicity  study  of  DRF  at  the  250 mg/kg/day  high  dose  level  (study  no.  AT 
5108-14;  EMEA/H/C/5437;  “Vumerity”),  which  did  not  recover  in  one  female.  The  physeal  dysplasia 
developed dose- and time-dependently, because it was neither observed in monkeys during short-term 
administration of higher DRF doses, nor after chronic treatment of lower dosages. Furthermore, an age-
dependency seems possible given that affected monkeys in the 91 days subchronic toxicity study were 
obviously of pre-pubertal age and consequently more susceptible for skeletal deficiencies than the adult 
and mature species of the DMF and DRF toxicology programs which lacked any bone defects. 
Albeit adequate nutrition is certainly important for normal ossification (Cappon GD et al. Birth Defects 
Res B Dev Reprod Toxicol. 2005; 74(5): 424-30; Nitzsche D, Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2017; 90: 95-
103),  it  appears  questionable,  if  the  defective  bone  mineralisation  in  juvenile  rats  and  the  physeal 
dysplasia in pre-pubertal monkeys can be simply disentangled. 
In the course of the MA evaluation of DRF, an anti-angiogenic activity of DMF and DRF was hypothesized, 
but  could  not  be  confirmed  for  the  main  active  metabolite  MMF  (García-Caballero  M  et al.  J Invest 
Dermatol.  2011).  Instead,  another  publication  rather  indicated  a  pro-angiogenic  effect  of  the  MMF 
effector Nrf2 (Li L et al. Sci Rep. 2016; 6: 37338). 
At  present,  a  direct  role  of  Nrf2  in  the  regulation  of  bone  homeostasis  seems  therefore  more  likely 
considering  recently  published  literature  data  on  the  role  of  Nrf2  in  bone  metabolism.  Increased 
osteoclast  counts  and  differentiation,  bone  resorption  and  impaired  formation  of  osteoblasts  were 
determined at higher magnitude in juvenile compared to adult Nrf2-deficient mice (Rana T et al. Free 
Radic Biol Med. 2012; 53(12): 2298-307; Hyeon S et al. Free Radic Biol Med. 2013; 65: 789-799.; Kim 
et al. Bone Res. 2014; 2: 14033; Sun YX et al. J Biomed Sci. 2015; 22: 101). Conversely, the stimulation 
of  Nrf2  signalling  by  DMF  interfered  with  osteoclast  formation  in vitro  and  in vivo,  induced  osteocyte 
specific  gene  expression  and  reduced  bone  loss  in  a  mouse  model  of  osteoporosis  (Yamaguchi  et al. 
J Cell Mol Med. 2018; 22(2): 1138-1147; Sánchez-de-Diego et al. Redox Biol. 2021; 40: 101845). Still, 
comparative analyses of wildtype, homozygous and heterozygous Keap 1 mutant mice point towards the 
importance  of  balanced  Nrf2  activation  for  normal  bone  formation:  While  moderate  Nrf2  activity  in 
heterozygous  Keap 1+/-  mice  was  associated  with  increased  bone  formation  and  lower  numbers  of 
osteoclasts  (Yin  et al.  Sci  Rep.  2020;  10(1):  348),  the  increased  Nrf2  activation  in  homozygous 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 15/152 
 
 
 
Keap 1-/- mice actually impaired osteoblast proliferation and induced bone hypoplasia (Yoshida E et al. 
Genes Cells. 2018; 23(5):386-392). 
Thus, the impaired bone mineralisation in juvenile rats treated with either DMF or DRF and the physeal 
dysplasia detected in the 91 days subchronic toxicity study of DRF in pre-pubertal monkeys might be 
mechanistically related to the increased stimulation of Nrf2-mediated regulation of bone formation by 
MMF. It is obvious that juvenile animals are more vulnerable to perturbations of bone development. In 
addition, the toxicology data of DRF suggest that bone deficits are also impacted by the extent of MMF 
exposure and the study duration. The bone findings are considered of minor relevance for adult RRMS 
patients, whereas the limited data render the relevance for paediatric patients unknown (see Annex 3 
and section 4.5 below). Considering these aspects, the MAH meanwhile agreed to restrict the paediatric 
population to the higher age range of 13 years or above. In addition, the defective bone development is 
delineated in section 5.3 of the SmPC of DMF. 
With regard to the environmental risk of DMF, the PEC calculation and the assessment of the MAH for 
the proposed extension of the RRMS population to paediatric patients is considered acceptable. The risk 
characterisation is based on the PNECs from the initial ERA, which had been assessed as acceptable at 
that time. All risk quotients considering the new PEC value are below 1 and a risk is not indicated. 
Although the correct Fpen of 0.00258 was used in the PEC calculation, the MAH inserted a wrong Pregion 
and calculated a wrong Fpen of 0.0014 on page 11 of the ERA. Since PECsw was calculated correctly, 
this has no influence on the risk characterisation.

3.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  proposed  extension  of  the  clinical  indication  of  DMF  to  paediatric  RRMS  patients  necessitated  an 
updated assessment of the juvenile toxicity studies, which had been formerly concluded by the CHMP 
when  the  corresponding  data  were  evaluated 
in  2016  (EMEA/H/C/2601/II/25)  and  2019 
(EMEA/H/C/2601/II/61/G), respectively. The essential findings of both investigations, and particularly 
the potential effect on bone growth has been adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of dimethyl fumarate.  
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
The  type  II  variation  requests  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  Tecfidera  in  RRMS  to  the  paediatric 
population aged 10 years and older. Tecfidera is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients 
with RRMS. The approved starting dose is 120 mg two times a day orally. After 7 days, the Tecfidera 
dose is proposed to be 240 mg BID (480 mg DMF per day). Temporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice

a day is foreseen and may reduce the occurrence of flushing and GI side effects. Within 1 month, the 
recommended maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day orally should be resumed.  
The  justification  of  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  paediatric  patients  aged  10  years  and  older  is 
supported by one phase III study, study 109MS306 (Part 1) and two phase II studies, study 109MS202 
and  its  extension,  study  109MS311.  Both  studies  have  previously  been  submitted  to  the  EMA  via 
variation (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042 and EMEA/H/C/2601/II/0059) and are shortly described in section 
4.4.2, supportive studies (reference is also made to section 4.3.2, PK/PD). Part 2 of study 109MS306, a 
5 year  optional  open-label  extension  study  for  patients  who  completed  Part 1  is  ongoing  and  will  be 
provided  as  separate  Clinical  Study  Report.  As  agreed  by  PDCO,  Part 2  is  not  included  in  the  PIP  for 
Tecfidera (EMEA-000832-PIP01-10-M03). 
The proposed posology in the paediatric population aged 10 years and older is the same as in adults.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic (PK) data have been provided as part of this variation procedure. The PK of 
Tecfidera is well established based on data from the clinical development programme for Tecfidera in 
adult participants with RRMS and healthy volunteers. The PK of the current formulation of Tecfidera was 
characterised in Study 109HV109, a bioequivalence study conducted in adult healthy volunteers.  
The PK of Tecfidera in paediatric participants (age range 13-17 years) with RRMS was evaluated in Study 
109MS202,  which  was  assessed  during  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042  and  which  led  to  updates  in  the 
product  information  (SmPC  sections  4.2,  4.8,  5.1,  and  5.2).  The  MAH  provided  a  summary  of  study

109MS311 
(assessed

procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0059). 
Study  109MS202  was  a  phase 2,  24-week,  open-label,  uncontrolled  study  to  assess  the  effect  of 
BG00012 on MRI lesions and PK in paediatric patients with RRMS aged 10 to 17 years (n=22). 
The  dose  regimen  was  the  same  as  the  approved  Tecfidera  dosing  regimen  in  adults  with  RRMS. 
Reference has been made to published data that suggest that the esterase activity is similar in children 
and in adolescents when compared with adults, suggesting that the relationship between body weight 
and  exposure  to  the  active  metabolite  of  Tecfidera  (MMF)  is  similar  in  the  paediatric  and  adult 
populations14. Additional data derived from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies (Study 109MS301 and 
Study  109MS302)  that  included  adult  participants  with  RRMS  with  body  weights  as  low  as  34 kg  and 
which lacked new or worsening safety issues. For these reasons, the approved dose in adults was chosen 
for study 109MS202. Data from the pivotal Phase 3 studies suggested that the variability in exposure 
did not affect safety and efficacy measures in adult participants with RRMS and suggested that Tecfidera 
240 mg BID should be tolerable in the paediatric population. 
Characterisation of the PK of Tecfidera in paediatric participants with RRMS was one of the secondary 
objectives of Study 109MS202. Overall, the PK parameters for Tecfidera in paediatric participants were 
similar to those observed in adults. As compared to adult healthy volunteers in Study 109HV109, the 
mean  maximum  observed  plasma  concentration  values  were  similar  in  paediatric  participants 
(1998.6 μg/L  paediatric  patients;  2121.2  μg/L  adults).  The  mean  calculated  area  under  the 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to the concentration at hour 12 (AUC0-12hr) values were comparable 
(3623.6  h*μg/L  paediatric  patients;  3504.6  h*μg/L  adults),  as  were  the  mean  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  from  time  0  to  infinity  (AUC0-inf) values  (3630.5  h*μg/L  paediatric  patients; 
3572.4  h*μg/L  adults).  Individual  time  to  reach  maximum  time  to  reach  maximum  observed  plasma 
concentration (tmax) in paediatric participants was variable (range: 1 to 8 hours), which is consistent with 
prior observations in adults. The tmax in paediatric participants was longer than in adult healthy volunteers 
receiving Tecfidera fasted (Study 109HV109) [4.2 and 2.6 hours, respectively], which is consistent with 
the food effect observed in adults. 
When Tecfidera was administered to adult participants with RRMS with food (Study 109MS101), the time 
to reach tmax in paediatric and adult participants was comparable (4.2 and 4.6 hours, respectively). Mean 
apparent clearance values (74.45 L/h paediatric patients; 74.42 L/h adults [Study 109HV109]) were also 
similar. Elimination of MMF in paediatric participants was fast with an average elimination half-life of less 
than  1  hour,  which  is  consistent  with  that  previously  observed  in  adult  participants  with  RRMS  and 
healthy  volunteers.  For  10  of  21  participants,  MMF  concentrations  in  plasma  were  below  the  limit  of 
quantification  at  10  hours  post  dose.  The  MAH  concludes  that  in  the  paediatric  population  similar  to 
adults no accumulation is expected to occur after 240 mg BID dosing. 
Study 109MS311 was the 96-week extension of study 109MS202 to determine the long-term safety 
and efficacy of BG00012 in paediatric patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (n =20). No PK 
data derived from this extension study.

3.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
For a detailed discussion of study 109MS202, reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042. Aspects 
regarding clinical efficacy and safety deriving from this study are also discussed in this variation report 
(section 2.4 and 2.5). Regarding the PK profile of Tecfidera, it can be concluded that the rate and extent 
of exposure in adolescent patients in study 109MS202 was found comparable to adult subjects. The PK 
analysis  population  included  21  subjects.  The  title  of  study  109MS202  “(…)  Pharmacokinetics  in 
paediatric patients with RRMS aged 10 to 17 years (…)” is misleading given that paediatric patients <13 
years of age have not been included in this study. Hence, this conclusion relates to adolescents only. It 
should be noted that age distribution in this study was skewed towards older adolescents, i.e. only 6 of 
21 evaluable patients were 13 to 15 years of age, and 15 of 21 patients were 16 and 17 years of age. 
The  median  age  was  16  years  and  body  weight  ranged  from  46  to 91  kg.  Thus,  the  study  sample  of 
children reflects older adolescents, who are more representative of adults. 
Regarding esterase expression and activity, a publication by Zhu et al. (2009) was referenced, which 
was found supportive in that adolescents aged 13 to 17 years exhibit a metabolic capacity comparable 
to adults. According to the MAH, supportive data regarding the same dose regimen applied in paediatric 
patients  and  adults  derived  from  the  pivotal  phase  3  clinical  studies  (Study  109MS301  and  Study 
109MS302) that included adult patients with RRMS with body weights as low as 34 kg without eliciting 
a different safety profile. However, the exact number of subjects with a low body weight has not been 
presented and is considered to be rather small. 
Overall, study 109MS202 is considered to provide supportive PK data in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years 
and therefore, in a subpopulation of the paediatric population studied in 109MS306.  
In contrast, no PK data in paediatric patients aged 10 to <13 years derive from study 109MS202 and at 
the same time, only very limited clinical data are available for this paediatric subpopulation from study 
109MS306  (i.e.  7  patients  treated  with  Tecfidera  and  8  patients  treated  with  Avonex).  Therefore, 
theoretical  considerations  by  the  MAH  concerning  this  very  young  paediatric  population  including 
comparable esterase expression and activity, PK data in adults with very low body weight (down to 34 
kg), and comparable clearance in paediatric participants and adults cannot be confirmed by data. From 
a clinical safety perspective, differences in the metabolic capacities between pre-pubertal patients aged 
10  to  <13  years  compared  to  adolescents  and  adults  cannot  be  excluded.  Scientific  knowledge  also 
recently stressed the importance of balanced Nrf2 activation for normal bone homeostasis (see section 
2.2  of  this  report).  As  such,  while  bone  effects  might  not  be  of  clinical  relevance  in  the  adult  RRMS 
population,  any  implications  in  paediatric  patients  (especially  in  the  very  young  and  pre-pubertal 
children) remain unknown.  
To  conclude,  the  lack  of  PK  data  in  the  subpopulation  of  paediatric  patients  aged  10  to  <13  years  in 
study 109MS202 needs to be brought into context with limited or even missing clinical data from study 
109MS306  in  the  same  subpopulation.  As  such,  relevant  safety  aspects  (e.g.  due  to  differences  in 
metabolic capacities) in this age group need to be addressed by clinical data for which PK data would be 
considered supportive. 
In this context, the MAH accepted to restrict the indication to paediatric patients aged 13 years and over.

3.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new data have been submitted in the course of this variation procedure. 
Available  and  previously  assessed  PK  data  from  a  small  paediatric  phase 2,  open-label,  uncontrolled 
study in 21 paediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years exhibit similar PKs as in adults and therefore provide 
supportive evidence for a subpopulation of the paediatric indication claimed. 
3.4.  Clinical efficacy 
3.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study in this population was conducted by the MAH. 
The proposed posology in the paediatric population aged 10 years and older is the same as in adults. 
The dose of the active comparator Avonex (titrated to 30 μg once weekly) was chosen because it was 
consistent with the recommended dose for the treatment of MS in adults and has been reported to be 
effective and well tolerated in paediatric patients with MS [Ghezzi 2005; Waubant and Chabas 2009]. 
3.4.2.  Main study 
To support the extension of indication in the paediatric population, the MAH conducted one phase III 
open-label,  active-controlled  study  of  96  weeks  duration,  Part  1  of  study  109MS306.  This  active-
controlled phase was followed by a 4-week safety follow-up, where applicable, and a 5-year extension 
(Part 2). 
Title of Study 
Study 109MS306 (Part 1) (also referred to as study CONNECT): 
An  open-label,  randomized,  multicenter,  multiple-dose,  active-controlled,  parallel-group, 
efficacy and safety study of BG00012 in children from 10 to less than 18 years of age with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with optional open-label extension 
Methods 
Study design 
Part 1 of Study 109MS306/CONNECT was an open-label, randomised, multicenter, multiple-dose, active-
controlled, parallel-group study. 
The study consisted of  
•  a screening period of up to 6 weeks, 
• 
followed by a 96-week treatment period 
•  a safety follow-up period of approximately 4 weeks (for patients who did not continue into Part 
2) 
The maximum planned duration of Part 1 of the study for an individual participant was approximately 
106  weeks.  Patients  who  experienced  MS  relapse  or  disability  progression  during  the  study  could

continue in the study. Patients who prematurely discontinued treatment could remain in the study and 
continue protocol-required tests and assessments. Patients who completed Week 96 in Part 1 and met 
the Part 2 entry criteria, were given the option to receive open-label Tecfidera 240 mg BID for 240 weeks 
in the optional Part 2 extension phase (up to approximately 5 years).

Treatments 
Investigational medicinal products (IMPs): Tecfidera (240 mg BID, oral) and Avonex (IFN β-1a) [30 µg 
once weekly, intramuscular injection]. Both groups received treatment for 96 weeks.  
Patients took 1 capsule of Tecfidera orally at a dose of 120 mg BID for the first 7 days and 2 capsules 
orally at a dose of 240 mg BID thereafter. 
Avonex was self-administered (or given via a proxy) once weekly beginning at Day 1/Baseline. Avonex 
doses  were  titrated  during  the  first  4  weeks  of  the  Study  Treatment  Period  using  the  Avostartgrip™ 
titration kit. Avonex was started at a dose of 7.5 μg and increased by 7.5 μg each week for 3 weeks until 
the recommended dose of 30 μg was achieved to reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms 
that  can  occur  when  initiating  Avonex  therapy  at  a  dose  of  30  μg.  At  the  discretion  of  the  treating 
neurologist, dose titration may not have been necessary. Following titration, Avonex was administered 
once weekly by IM injection according to local prescribing information. Avonex doses were to be taken 
within 2 days of the scheduled dose. If a patient was unable to have the dose within 2 days, that dose 
was to be skipped, and the next dose taken as scheduled.  
Modification of Tecfidera treatment schedule 
Dose  Reduction  was  allowed  only  for  patients  who  were  unable  to  tolerate  Tecfidera  due  to  flushing 
and/or GI disturbances. These patients reduced their dosage by taking 1 capsule (120 mg) BID for up 
to 4 weeks. Within 4 weeks at the reduced dose, patients resumed taking 2 capsules BID. If the patient 
was still unable to tolerate Tecfidera, the patient discontinued Tecfidera.  
Dose Interruption: if a patient had any of the following laboratory test results: AST or ALT > 3 × ULN, 
creatinine > 1.2 × ULN, white blood cells (WBC) count < 2000/mm3, positive haematuria on microscopy 
without  known  aetiology.  If  these  laboratory  tests  remained  at  these  levels  for  4  weeks  or  more, 
Tecfidera was permanently discontinued and the event was recorded as an adverse event (AE). Patients 
who subsequently developed the same abnormal laboratory value at any other time during the study 
permanently discontinued treatment with Tecfidera (i.e., only 1 dosing interruption was allowed for each 
patient  for  the  same  laboratory  abnormality).  However,  patients  who  subsequently  experienced  a 
different  laboratory  abnormality  could  have  study  treatment  with  Tecfidera  withheld  again.  However, 
only 2 dosing interruptions were allowed for each patient. 
Dose Resumption: considered on a case-by-case basis and discussed with the Medical Monitor. Patients 
with abnormal laboratory values after Week 12 (after which clinic visits occurred once every 3 months) 
who were allowed to resume Tecfidera dosing following a 2- to 4-week interruption restarted dosing at 
a reduced dose of 1 capsule BID for 1 week. Patients also returned to the initial 4-weekly visit schedule 
for  safety  assessments  for  2  consecutive  normal  laboratory  assessments  before  reverting  to  the  3-
monthly schedule. After 1 week at the reduced dose, patients took 2 capsules BID. 
Concomitant medications 
Symptomatic therapy, such as treatment for spasticity, depression, or fatigue, was not restricted, but 
had to be optimised as early as possible during screening in an attempt to maintain consistent treatment 
for the duration of the study. Patients were instructed not to start taking any new medications, including 
non-prescribed drugs, unless they had received permission from the Investigator. Any systemic steroid 
therapy,  except  for  protocol-defined  treatment  of  relapses,  were  not  allowed.  Steroids  that  were 
administered by non-systemic routes (e.g., topical, inhaled) were allowed. 
The  treatment  for  relapse  was  either  3  or  5  days  with  intravenous  methylprednisolone  up  to  1000 
mg/day, given once a day or in divided doses. Any changes to this treatment had to be first discussed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022

with the Sponsor Medical Director (or designee). Steroid retreatment of the same relapse was not allowed 
unless approved by the Sponsor Medical Director (or designee). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To evaluate the safety, tolerability,  and efficacy of BG00012 in paediatric subjects 
with RRMS, as compared with a disease-modifying treatment (DMT). 
Secondary objectives: To assess health outcomes and evolution of disability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following efficacy assessments were performed for Study 109MS306 Part 1: 
•  Brain MRI Scan ± Gd: at baseline, week 24 ± 14D, week 48 ± 14D, week 72 ± 14D, end of part 
1/baseline part 2 visit, early withdrawal visit and at unscheduled relapse assessment visit. 
•  Clinical relapses: at unscheduled relapse assessment visit. 
•  EDSS:  at screening, baseline, week 12 ± 5D,  week  24 ± 5D,  week 36  ± 5D,  week 48 ± 5D, 
week 60 ± 5D, week 72 ± 5D, week 84 ± 5D, end of part 1/baseline part 2 visit, early withdrawal 
visit and at unscheduled relapse assessment visit. 
•  Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) scores, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) 
scores and school progression query: at baseline, week 48 ± 5D, end of part 1/baseline part 2 
visit and at early withdrawal visit (not school progression query). 
•  PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and PedsQL Quality of Life Scale: at baseline, week 24 ± 
5D, week 48 ± 5D, week 72 ± 5D, end of part 1/baseline part 2 visit, early withdrawal visit and 
at unscheduled relapse assessment visit. 
Outcome and assessment scales 
Clinical  relapses  were  defined  as  new  or  recurrent  neurologic  symptoms  not  associated  with  fever  or 
infection,  lasting  at  least  24  hours,  and  accompanied  by  new  objective  neurologic  findings  upon 
examination  by  the  treating  neurologist  that  were  confirmed  upon  evaluation  by  the  examining 
neurologist. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that occurred less than 30 days following the onset 
of a protocol-defined relapse were considered part of the same relapse and were not treated with IVMP 
within the protocol. If a patient experienced new neurologic symptoms, they or their caregiver contacted 
the  treating  neurologist  or  treating  nurse  as  soon  as  possible  and  within  48  hours  of  the  onset  of 
symptoms to complete a Telephone Questionnaire to determine the necessity of an Unscheduled Relapse 
Assessment Visit. If the visit was required, the participant was then evaluated in person by the treating 
neurologist at the Unscheduled Relapse Assessment Visit as soon as possible and within 72 hours of the 
onset  of  the  potential  relapse.  If,  in  the  opinion  of  the  treating  neurologist,  an  MS  relapse  may  have 
occurred, the patient was also evaluated by the examining neurologist as soon as possible and within 5 
days  of  the  onset  of  the  symptoms.  The  examining  neurologist  performed  a  detailed  neurologic 
examination  and  obtained  an  EDSS  score.  New  objective  findings  on  the  neurologic  examination 
performed by the examining neurologist were required to confirm that a protocol-defined relapse had 
occurred. Unscheduled Relapse Assessment Visits did not modify or replace the patients’ visit schedule. 
Treatment of an acute relapse could proceed at the discretion of the treating neurologist only after the 
completion of the examining neurologist’s examination and only after a Gd-enhancing MRI of the brain 
had been performed.

The EDSS is a standardized method, widely accepted, ordinal scale used to evaluate disability in people 
with MS (Kurtzke, 1983). The EDSS is evaluated according to signs and symptoms observed during a 
standard  neurological  examination.  These  clinical  observations  are  classified  in  7  functional  system 
scales, each of them grading signs and symptoms for different neurological functions: visual, brainstem, 
pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel or bladder, and cerebral. The score ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 
10.0  (death  due  to  MS).  Disability  progression  was  assessed  using  the  EDSS.  Confirmed  EDSS 
progression was defined as at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS ≥ 1.0 that 
was sustained for 12 weeks, or at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS = 0 that 
was  sustained  for  12  weeks.  A  tentative  EDSS  progression  was  confirmed  when  this  minimum  EDSS 
change was present on the next study visit occurring after 74 days or longer from the initial observation. 
The 74-day interval was based on the visit windows allowed in the protocol around the target visit day. 
Time to EDSS progression was censored at the earlier of the first date of the alternative medication or 
the last EDSS assessment date, unless a patient was undergoing an unconfirmed progression at the last 
EDSS visit. 
The BVMT-R is a measure of visuospatial memory used to document changes over time. This test was 
performed to assess learning/memory. 
The SDMT is a valid and sensitive measure of cognitive processing speed that is easy to conduct and to 
follow by MS patients. 
School  progression  query:  If  permitted  by  the  local  regulatory  authority,  the  following  question  was 
posed  to  patients  or  caregivers:  “During  the  past  year,  did  [you/the  participant]  progress  from  one 
[class/grade level] to the next in school?” 
The  PedsQL  Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale  and  the  PedsQL  Quality  of  Life  Scale:  Both  scales  were 
measured  by  the  participant’s  self-assessment  and  that  of  the  parent/legal  guardian.  The  PedsQL 
Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale  contains  18  questions  in  3  fatigue  dimensions  (General  Fatigue, 
Sleep/Rest Fatigue, and Cognitive Fatigue). The PedsQL Quality of Life Scale contains 23 questions in 4 
dimensions  (Physical  Functioning,  Emotional  Fatigue,  Social  Fatigue,  and  School  Fatigue).  Scoring  for 
each question was based on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always). Each individual 
score was then reversed (subtracted from 4) and linearly transformed as follows: 0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 
50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0. For each dimension, the total score was calculated as the sum of all the items divided 
by the number of items answered. In the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, a higher total score 
indicated  fewer  problems,  and  in  the  PedsQL  Quality  of  Life  Scale,  a  higher  score  indicated  a  better 
quality of life. 
Brain MRI: was not performed within 30 days of receiving a course of steroids, with the exception of 
MRIs  obtained  for  the  purpose  of  relapse  assessment.  The  following  Brain  MRI  parameters  were 
performed:  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions,  total  Gd-enhancing  lesions,  new  T1 
hypointense lesions. 
The MRI scans were forwarded to an independent, blinded, central MRI center for assessment.

Sample size 
The sample size was primarily based on feasibility, with the goal of having 50 evaluable patients at the 
96-week time-point of Part 1 for each treatment group. Therefore, the study was not powered for the 
Part 1 primary endpoint. Based on an estimated dropout rate of approximately 30% over 2 years, a total 
of  142  patients  were  needed  to  be  enrolled  to  have  at  least  100  evaluable  patients  (50  patients  per 
treatment  group)  after  2  years  of  treatment.  With  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint  of  Part  1,  if  the 
proportion of patients free from new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was approximately 25%, 
the width of the 95% CI for the proportion would be approximately 0.24. If the proportion was around 
40%, the width of the 95% CI would be approximately 0.28. This sample size provided approximately 
82%  power  for  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  Part  1  of  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense lesions at Week 24. The assumptions were based on historical data on treatment effect for 
Avonex and Tecfidera on the number of T2 hyperintense lesions compared with placebo. It was assumed 
that the mean (SD) would be 3.5 (6.3) and 1.22 (2.92) for the number of new or newly enlarging T2 
hyperintense  lesions  at  Week  24  for  the  Avonex  group  and  the  Tecfidera  group,  respectively  (a  65% 
reduction over the Avonex group). At Week 24, a 10% dropout rate was expected, resulting in about 63 
evaluable patients per group. Based on these assumptions, the study had approximately 82% power to 
detect the difference between Tecfidera and Avonex. This power calculation was based on a negative 
binomial simulation. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  by  an  interactive  voice/web  response  system  at  the 
Baseline Visit (Day 1) to receive Tecfidera or Avonex in a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to whether 
Assessment report

or not the participant received therapy with IFN β-1a or GA in the 4 weeks prior to study entry and in 
accordance with the following 3 age groups (10 to < 13 years: at least 10 evaluable patients, 13 to < 
15 years: at least 20 evaluable patients, and 15 to < 18 years: at least 60 evaluable patients). Patients 
who withdrew from the study were not replaced. 
Blinding (masking) 
According to the clinical study report, page, 35, blinding has not been applicable as this was an open-
label study.  
Statistical methods 
The  statistical  methods used  in  this  study  are  further  described  in the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP), 
dated 06 December 2019. 
Nominal p-values are presented for reference only and are not corrected for multiplicity. 
Analysis populations: 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: subjects who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment. 
Completers Population: subjects from the ITT Population who completed Week 96 of the study and who 
have MRI data for Week 96. 
ITT Population with week 96 MRI measurements 
Primary endpoint analyses: Proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense 
lesions on brain MRI scans at Week 96 
The analysis of the primary endpoint included summary statistics and exact confidence intervals (CIs) 
(using the Clopper-Pearson method) for the proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 
hyperintense  lesions  at  Week  96  for  each  treatment  group;  it  was  performed  on  the  Completers 
Population. Data were summarized using observed values. Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
were performed on the ITT Population (1] full ITT Population, 2] ITT Population including Week 96 MRI 
measurements (post hoc analysis)). 
In both sensitivity analyses, a logistic regression model was used to analyse the proportion of participants 
free of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, adjusted for age group and other baseline covariates, such as 
baseline T2 volume, sex, baseline EDSS and the number of relapses in a year prior to the study. In both 
analyses,  the  odds  ratio  (OR)  for  the  odds  of  no  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  lesions  in  the  Tecfidera 
treatment group, divided by the odds of the same event in the Avonex treatment group, was calculated. 
The p-value from the likelihood ratio test that the OR is 1 was given. An additional, separate efficacy 
analysis was carried out based on pubertal status at disease initiation (obtained from the Tanner staging 
at screening). 
Secondary Endpoint Analyses: 
Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans at Weeks 24 and 96 
A negative binomial regression model was used to analyse the number of new or newly enlarging T2 
hyperintense lesions at both Week 24 and at Week 96, with treatment group in the model and adjusted 
for age group and baseline number of T2 lesions. Formal statistical testing was performed to compare 
the  mean  between  the  2  treatment  groups.  These  Week  24  and  Week  96  analyses  were  based  on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 27/152 
 
 
 
participants  from  the  ITT  Population  who  had  observed  data  at  Weeks  24  and  96,  correspondingly. 
Analyses of the number of Gd-enhancing lesions and number of T1 hypointense lesions were performed 
similarly. 
A sensitivity analysis compared the number of new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions over 96 
weeks relative to baseline between treatment groups using a negative binomial regression model on the 
observed number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions at the participants’ last visit prior to the Week 
96. The logarithmic transformation of the last scan number (out of the 4 scheduled scans) was included 
in  the  model  as  the  “offset”  parameter.  The  model  was  adjusted  for  the  baseline  volume  of  T2 
hyperintense lesions and baseline age group. Results of these models were exponentiated to transform 
back to lesion counts. In addition, a similar analysis was done using the last scan prior to alternative 
medication and up to Week 96. 
The proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans 
at Weeks 24 and 48 and the proportion of participants free of new MRI activity (i.e., free of Gd-enhancing 
and free of new or newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions on brain MRI scans) at Weeks 24, 48, and 96 were 
analysed similarly as the primary endpoint without the corresponding sensitivity analyses. Participants 
were considered free of MRI activity if they were free of Gd-enhancing lesions at all post-baseline visits 
up to and including the specified visit and free of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions relative to Baseline.  
Time to first relapse 
Time to first relapse and estimated proportion of participants relapsed or relapse-free were presented 
based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  If  participants  did  not  experience  a  relapse  during  Part  1  of  the 
study, they were censored at their last visit in Part 1. Time to first relapse was also analysed using the 
Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for baseline relapse rate, baseline EDSS score, and age group. 
Proportion of participants free of relapse up to Week 96 
The  proportion  of  relapse-free  participants  up  to  Week  96  was  summarized.  In  addition,  for  the  ITT 
Population, the estimated proportion of participants who were relapse-free up to Week 96 was calculated 
based on the Kaplan-Meier method. 
ARR at Weeks 48 and 96 
ARR,  calculated  as  the  total  number  of  relapses  that  occurred  during  the  study  divided  by  the  total 
number of participant-years followed was presented by treatment group. Adjusted ARR, obtained from 
a negative binomial regression, adjusted for baseline relapse rate, baseline EDSS score and age group, 
was presented for each treatment group, along with the rate ratio for Tecfidera versus Avonex. 
Fatigue  as  measured  by  the  PedsQL  Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale  scores  and  Quality  of  Life  as 
measured by the PedsQL  
At  each  scheduled  visit,  summary  statistics  were  presented  for  each  dimension  for  both  scales  by 
treatment group. Additionally, these endpoints were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
adjusted for baseline score and age group. Results for each scale were presented for the self-assessment 
and the parent assessment. 
Summary statistics of change from baseline to Week 96 in EDSS score were presented for each treatment 
group.  Time  to  progression  of  disability  (based  on  EDSS)  and  estimated  proportion  of  participants 
progressed  at  Week  96  were  presented  based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  and  analysed  using  Cox 
regression. 
BVMT-R and SDMT scores and changes from baseline were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Safety: All summary analyses of AEs referred to treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). TEAEs were defined 
as  AEs  occurring  or  worsening  after  beginning  study  treatment  (after  the  first  dose  in  this  study). 
Analyses of TEAEs included all events through the end of a participant’s follow-up. TEAEs were analysed 
based on incidence, defined as the proportion of participants who had at least 1 occurrence of an event 
out of the number of participants. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) V23.1 was 
utilized to code and group TEAEs by system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT). Summaries of 
TEAEs  included  the  numbers  and  incidences/percentages  of  participants  in  the  ITT  population  with  a 
TEAE,  a  severe  TEAE,  a  related  TEAE,  a  treatment-emergent  serious  AEs  (SAE),  TEAEs  leading  to 
interruption  or  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  or  withdrawal  from  study,  and  adverse  events  of 
special interest (AESIs). 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
The SAP indicated that analyses would be adjusted for the use of IFN β-1a or GA in the 4 weeks before 
randomisation.  However,  this  stratification  factor  was  introduced  in  Protocol  V5,  and  the  majority  of 
patients who were already in the study when this protocol version was implemented did not have this 
information collected at randomisation. When both MS treatment history and randomisation data were 
used to identify prior IFN β-1a or GA use in the 4 weeks before randomisation, only 4 patients met the 
criterion, so that factor was not used as a covariate in the final analyses.

patients),  Czech  Republic  (4  centres:  randomised  15  patients),  Denmark  (3  centres:  randomised  1 
patient), France (11 centres: randomised 37 patients), Hungary (2 centres: randomised 10 patients), 
Italy (9 centres: randomised 24 patients), Poland (6 centres: randomised 13 patients), Serbia (3 centres: 
randomised  12  patients),  Sweden  (2  centres:  randomised  5  patients),  United  Kingdom  (4  centres:

Conduct of the study 
Changes to the original protocol (dated 17 December 2013) included 4 global protocol amendments. 
Amendment No 1 (resulting in protocol version 2 with date 10 February 2014), amongst others: 
•  Addition  of  blood  sample  volumes  to  address  the  2008  EU  Guidance  for  paediatric  studies  in 
which sample blood volume collection is recommended to be included in the protocol. 
Amendment No 2 (resulting in protocol version 3 with date 16 January 2015), amongst others: 
• 
• 
To enable the early identification of subjects who are at risk for developing severe, prolonged 
lymphopenia, and to provide additional guidance on the management of such subjects. 
Inclusion criterion #6 has been revised for alignment with other paediatric MS studies: to include 
patients who had at least 2 relapses within the last 24 months prior to Day 1, rather than just 
patients who had at least 1 relapse within the last 12 months prior to Day 1. 
•  Modification of the treatment schedule for Avonex, section 10.1.2, that at the discretion of the 
treating neurologist, dose titration may not be necessary.  
Amendment No 3 (resulting in protocol version 4 with date 08 February 2016), amongst others: 
• 
• 
The long-term extension study (part 2) was added required by PDCO. 
The  follow-up  period  was  extended  from  24  weeks  to  48  weeks  for  subjects  who  completed, 
temporarily  withhold,  or  permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  for  any  reason  and  had  a 
lymphocyte count less than the lower limit of normal (<LLN). 
•  Addition  of  BVMT-R  scores,  SDMT  scores  and  school  progression  query  at  weeks  48  and  96 
(exploratory endpoints) in Part 1 to align with the PIP requirements as well as to provide baseline 
measurements for these assessments in Part 2.  
•  Addition of Gd-enhanced brain MRIs for relapses. 
• 
Inclusion criteria: Modification of the definition of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS): 
“Must  have  a  diagnosis  of  RRMS  according  to  the  International  Paediatric  Multiple 
Sclerosis  Study  Group  criteria  for  paediatric  MS  (2013)  [Krupp  2013]  (consensus 
definition  for paediatric  RRMS)  [Krupp  2007]).”    The  definition  of  RRMS  was  updated  to  align 
with the most recent consensus definition for paediatric RRMS and as agreed to with PDCO. 
• 
Exclusion  criteria:  To  shorten  the  period  between  prior  immunomodulatory  treatment  with 
glatiramer acetate or IFN β from 3 months to 4 weeks prior Day 1 of the study (a 4-week washout 
period is considered adequate to ensure that both IFN β-1a and GA have been eliminated, and 
no additional PDs effects would be expected). 
Amendment No 4 (resulting in protocol version 5 with date 25 July 2017), amongst others: 
•  Removal of the PK/ PD sub-study due to recruitment difficulties and due to the fact that Study 
109MS202,  which  evaluated  the  PK/PD  of  BG00012  in  22  paediatric  subjects  with  RRMS,  has 
recently been completed. 
•  Decreasing the required number of 10 to 12-year-old subjects from 20 evaluable subjects to 10 
evaluable  subjects  and  removal  of  the  requirement  for  a  minimum  number  of  pre-pubertal 
subjects.  Instead,  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  establish  pubertal  status  of  the  patients  at 
disease onset (retrospectively) and to perform an additional efficacy analysis based on pubertal 
status at disease initiation.) 
•  Removal of the washout requirement for IFN β-1a and GA. 
•  Addition of stratification of randomisation by whether or not the subject had received therapy 
with IFN β-1a or glatiramer acetate in the 4 weeks prior to study entry. 
Protocol deviations 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 32/152 
 
 
 
In total, 126 of 150 patients (84%) had at least 1 major protocol deviation: Avonex, 60 of 72 patients 
(83%); Tecfidera, 66 of 78 patients (85%). 
Table 3: Summary of Major Protocol Deviations (ITT Population) 
Major deviations: changes from the protocol that could affect data integrity or patient safety; e.g., errors 
in  ICF  signing,  incorrect  study  treatment  storage  conditions,  missed  doses  of  study  treatment, 
noncertified  (EDSS/SDMT/BVMT-R)  site  staff  performing  assessments,  and  unscheduled  relapse 
assessment visits occurring outside of the protocol-defined visit window.  
Overall, the most common types of major protocol deviations (reported in > 25% of patients in either 
treatment  group)  were  study  procedures  criteria  (84  patients,  56%),  informed  consent  (55  patients, 
37%),  IP  compliance  (45  patients,  30%),  and  laboratory  assessment  criteria  (43  patients,  29%).  A 
higher percentage of patients in the Tecfidera group than the Avonex group had IP compliance protocol 
deviations  (Avonex:  12  patients,  17%;  Tecfidera:  33  patients,  42%)  and  informed  consent  protocol 
deviations (Avonex: 20 patients, 28%; Tecfidera: 35 patients, 45%), and a higher percentage of patients 
in the Avonex group than the Tecfidera group had study procedures criteria protocol deviations (Avonex: 
44 patients, 61%; Tecfidera: 40 patients, 51%) and laboratory assessment criteria protocol deviations 
(Avonex: 24 patients, 33%; Tecfidera: 19 patients, 24%). 
According to the Applicant, there were no major protocol deviations that substantially impacted study 
findings or conclusions. 
Protocol Deviations Due to COVID-19: Overall, 10 of 150 patients (7%) had at least 1 major protocol 
deviation related to COVID-19 pandemic measures (Avonex: 3 patients, 4%; Tecfidera: 7 patients, 9%). 
The only types of major protocol deviations related to COVID-19 pandemic measures that were reported 
in patients in both treatment groups were study procedures criteria (Avonex: 1 patient, 1%; Tecfidera: 
4  patients,  5%)  and  visit  schedule  criteria  (Avonex:  2  patients,  3%;  Tecfidera:  3  patients,  4%).  In 
addition,  patients  in  the  Tecfidera  group  had  laboratory  assessment  criteria  protocol  deviations  (2 
patients, 3%) due to the pandemic. 
Audits: A total of ten sites were audited during the study.

Baseline data 
Baseline demographic characteristics 
Demographic characteristics were generally similar in both treatment groups (Table 4). 
ITT population: The mean (SD) age was 14.9 (1.62) years. Most (103 patients, 69%) were aged between 
15  and  17  years,  32  patients  (21%)  were  aged  13  or  14  years,  and  15  patients  (10%)  were  aged 
between 10 and 12 years. More than two-thirds of the patients were female (101 patients, 67%). Racial 
group was not collected for 53 patients (35%) because of confidentiality regulations and was missing or 
unknown for an additional 67 patients (45%). The mean (SD) weight was 63.88 (14.576) kg, mean (SD) 
height was 164.5 (8.68) cm, and mean (SD) BMI was 23.5 (4.42) kg/m2.  
In the Completers Population (n =103) (evaluated for the primary endpoint), 36 of 103 patients (35%) 
were male. Most (70 patients, 68%) were aged between 15 and 17 years, 21 patients (20%) were aged 
between 13 and 14 years, and 12 patients (12%) were aged between 10 and 12 years.

ARR at Weeks 48 and 96 
The participant relapse rate was calculated as the number of relapses for each participant divided by the 
number of years followed in the study for that participant. At Week 48, the mean (SD) participant relapse 
rate for the Avonex group was 0.609 (1.3126), and for the Tecfidera group, it was 0.403 (1.0366). At 
Week 96, it was 0.697 (1.2685) for the Avonex group and 0.407 (1.0050) for the Tecfidera group.

Change from Baseline to Week 96 in the EDSS score 
Results for the EDSS score were only descriptively summarised: the mean (SD) EDSS score at baseline 
was 1.12 (0.966) and 1.16 (1.074) for the Avonex and the Tecfidera treatment group, respectively, while 
at week 96 the mean (SD) EDSS score was 1.19 (1.101) and 1.17 (1.217), respectively, representing 
almost no changes in EDSS score for both treatment groups from study start until the end of the 96 
weeks period.

Number of Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI scans at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 
At all timepoints, the majority of participants in both treatment groups had no Gd-enhancing lesions; 
the proportion was higher in the Tecfidera group than the Avonex group at all timepoints. Based on an 
ordinal logistic regression adjusted for age group and number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, there 
were no statistically significant differences in proportions between the treatment groups at any timepoint 
(based on OR). At Week 96, the OR of being in the group with higher Gd lesions in the Tecfidera group 
versus Avonex group was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.18, 1.03), p = 0.0596.

According  to  the  Applicant,  the  mean  BVMT-R  scores  at  Baseline  for  each  of  the  3  trials  and  mean 
changes from baseline for each of the 3 trials over time were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
Mean SDMT scores at Baseline were similar in the 2 treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline over 
time were higher in the Tecfidera group than in the Avonex group.

Comparison of clinical efficacy in the paediatric population and in young adults: 
The  Tecfidera  studies  DEFINE  and  CONFIRM  (Study  109MS301  and  Study  109MS302)  included 
participants aged 18 to 55 years with a diagnosis of RRMS (McDonald criteria) and baseline EDSS score 
between 0 and 5.0, inclusive [Soman 2015]. Participants were randomised to Tecfidera 240 mg BID or 
three  times  a  day,  placebo,  or  GA  (Study  109MS302  only)  for  up  to  96  weeks.  The  integrated  ITT 
Population included 771 participants receiving Tecfidera BID and 769 participants receiving placebo. Of 
these, 74 participants in the Tecfidera BID group and 87 participants in the placebo group were aged 18 
to 25 years. 
According to the Applicant, in young adults, Tecfidera BID was associated with a 71% reduction in the 
adjusted ARR at 2 years: the ARR was 0.2 for the Tecfidera BID group and 0.67 for the placebo group 
(rate ratio [95% CI] 0.29 [0.17, 0.51]; p < 0.0001). This compared favourably with the 49% reduction 
in the adjusted ARR observed with Tecfidera BID versus placebo in the overall integrated ITT Population 
(ARR 0.52 [0.43, 0.62]; p < 0.0001). The estimated proportion of participants aged 18 to 25 years who

relapsed  was  also  significantly  lower  with  Tecfidera  BID  (26.1%)  than  with  placebo  (58.4%), 
representing  a  66%  reduction;  HR  (95%  CI)  for  Tecfidera/placebo,  0.34  (0.20,  0.59);  p  <  0.0001. 
Among young adults at 2 years, Tecfidera BID also demonstrated significant reductions in the number 
of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions (66% reduction vs. placebo; p < 0.0001) and Gd-enhancing lesions 
(73%  reduction  vs.  placebo;  p  =  0.0027).  The  proportion  of  young  adults  with  12-week  confirmed 
disability progression at 2 years was 3-fold lower in the Tecfidera BID group (6.3%) than the placebo 
group (18.9%), resulting in a 75% reduction (HR [95% CI] for Tecfidera BID/placebo, 0.25 [0.08, 0.77]; 
p = 0.0151).

Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint was based on the Completers population (Dimethyl 
fumarate: n = 62; IFN: n = 41) 
For  all  MRI  based  secondary  endpoints,  the  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ITT  Population 
excluding patients without MRI measurements at that visit (e.g.at week 96: Dimethyl fumarate: n 
= 62; IFN: n = 42) 
 For ARR and EDSS scores the primary analysis was based on the ITT population (patients who were 
randomised and received at least 1 dose of study treatment) (Dimethyl fumarate: n = 78; IFN: n 
= 72)

The primary analysis and several of the analyses of secondary endpoints were based on the Completers 
population (or patients with MRI data at the respective visit). This is not considered appropriate as the 
completer population is probably a selected population such that analyses based on these population 
are biased, as the outcomes in patients with missing data are expected to be different than for patients 
with  observed  data.  Therefore,  analyses  based  on  the  ITT  population  are  considered  of  primary 
relevance. 
No comparison between treatment arms was planned for the primary analysis and no procedure for 
multiplicity adjustment was pre-specified. 
 *All p-values should be considered as descriptive.

Supportive studies 
Reference is also made to section 2.3.2 (Pharmacokinetics). 
Study  109MS202  was  a  phase  II,  24-week,  open-label,  uncontrolled  study  to  assess  the  effect  of 
BG00012 on MRI lesions and Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with RRMS aged 10 to 17 years (n 
=22). 
Study 109MS311 was the 96 week extension of study 109MS202 to determine the long-term safety 
and efficacy of BG00012 in paediatric patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (n =20). 
3.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In support of efficacy of DMF (synonym: Tecfidera, BG00012) in paediatric RRMS patients aged 10 years 
and older, which has been updated during this procedure to ‘13 years of age and older’, the Applicant 
submitted one pivotal study in line with the agreed PIP (EMEA-000832-PIP01-10). 
Study 109MS306 Part 1 was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, multiple-dose, active-controlled, 
parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of BG00012 in children from 10 to less than 18 years of age 
with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with optional open-label extension. 
No  dedicated  dose  response  study  in  this  population  was  conducted  by  the MAH.  Consistent  with  the 
treatment  regimen  in  adult  RRMS  patients,  the  proposed  starting  dose  for  Tecfidera  in  the  paediatric 
population is 120 mg BID, orally, to be increased to 240 mg BID after 7 days. This dosing regimen has 
also been chosen in a previous paediatric study, study 109MS202, that has been matter of assessment 
in 2017 (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042) (Reference is made to 3.3.). As of the date of the study conduct, 
the choice and the dose of the active comparator IFN ß-1a is considered adequate. It also has been used 
in the paediatric study for Gilenya (EMEA/H/C/002202/X/0044/G). 
The population enrolled in study 109MS306 (n = 156; in a 1:1 ratio for IFN ß-1a and Tecfidera, stratified 
according to whether or not the participant received therapy with IFN β-1a or GA in the 4 weeks prior to 
study entry and in accordance with the following 3 age groups (10 to < 13 years: at least 10 evaluable 
patients, 13 to < 15 years: at least 20 evaluable patients, and 15 to < 18 years: at least 60 evaluable 
patients) was composed of males (33%) and females (67%) aged from 10 to 17 years with a median 
age of 15.0 years. There were 5 patients in the Avonex group who withdrew from the study before first 
treatment and 1 patient in the Tecfidera group who was randomised but not treated. According to the 
Applicant,  this  was  due  to  the  open-label  nature  of  the  trial:  patients  withdrew  from  the  trial  after 
realising what treatment they were assigned to.  
After protocol version 5 (25 July 2017) has been completed, 34 patients were randomised to the Avonex 
arm and 34 patients were randomised to Tecfidera. The provided randomisation list shows, that several 
patients  in  the  year  2018  still  have  been  randomised  based  on  protocol  version  4  (not  including  the 
stratification according to whether or not the participant received therapy with IFN β-1a or GA in the 4 
weeks prior to study entry). However, as none of these patients used IFN β-1a or GA in the 4 weeks 
prior to study entry, the delayed implementation of  the protocol amendment did not affect the study 
outcomes. 
The percentage of children <13 years was small (10%, as agreed by PDCO)  and was also limited for 
those who were pre-pubertal (Tanner staging score of 1) at baseline [Avonex four patients (2 male and 
two  female)  vs.  Tecfidera  1  male  patient].  The  mean  number  of  relapses  within  the  past  year  was 
comparable between the two treatment arms (mean = 1.6, median 1.0) as were the number of relapses 
within the past two years and the past three years (mean = 1.9, median 2.0 and mean = 2.0, median 
2.0,  respectively).  Besides  2  patients  under  Avonex  and  1  patient  under  Tecfidera,  all  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 53/152 
 
 
 
experienced  relapses  within  the  past  2  years.  Regarding  the  disease  progression  stage,  the  study 
population consisted of rather newly diagnosed RRMS patients with a mean time since MS diagnosis of 
about 0.8 years (median = 0 years) and a mean time since first symptoms of MS of about 1.5 years 
(median = 1.0 years). The overall mean EDSS score at baseline was 1.1 representing almost no disability 
with only  minimal  signs in  some  functional  systems.  The  mean  number  of  T2 lesions  at  baseline  was 
37.24 (32.023) and 45.63 (36.304) in the Avonex and Tecfidera groups, respectively while the mean 
number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 3.58 (7.578) and 2.35 (3.417) in the Avonex and Tecfidera groups, 
respectively. Thus, the included patient population mainly consisted of early stage RRMS patients. 
Around 69% of patients were naïve to previous MS treatment. Based on the overall study population, 
only 14 patients (9%) had taken IFN β-1a prior to study entry (Avonex group: 4 patients, 6%; Tecfidera 
group: 10 patients, 13%) and 6 patients (4%) had taken GA prior to study entry (3 patients, 4% in each 
treatment group). The imbalance across the two treatment arms with regard to IFN ß-1a pre-treatment 
might be caused by the number of patients who dropped out in the Avonex arm after they were aware 
that they had been randomised to IFN treatment.  
The primary endpoint, the “proportion of subjects free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions 
on  brain  MRI  scans  at  week  96”  was  recommended  by  the  PDCO  (EMEA-000832-PIP01-10)  and  is 
considered  appropriate  although  MRI  endpoints  are  currently  not  recommended  in  the  Guideline  on 
clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products 
for 
the 
treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.2)  to  demonstrate  evidence  of  efficacy  in  confirmatory  studies. 
Nevertheless, paediatric MS is dominated by inflammation and MRI can act as a marker for inflammatory 
activity.  Typical  MRI  parameter  for  assessing  the  inflammatory  component  of  MS  are  Gd-enhancing 
lesions and new/newly enlarging T2 lesions. Both have been widely used in clinical studies. Since they 
have  been  related  to  relapses,  the  most  important  clinical  component  of  paediatric  MS,  they  are 
considered important endpoints to reflect disease activity. Apart from that MRI endpoints played a key 
role in the assessment of efficacy for the paediatric indication of Aubagio (EMA/CHMP/289596/2021). 
With  the  responses,  the  Applicant  clarified,  that  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint,  the  “proportion of 
subjects free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans at week 96” were 
based on all available MRI scans, including scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
The secondary endpoints, e.g. the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain 
MRI scans, the proportion of subjects free of new MRI activity (i.e., free of Gd-enhancing and free of 
new or newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions on brain MRI scans) and the number of Gd-enhancing lesions on 
brain MRI scans (assessed as exploratory endpoint) are also supportive to reflect disease activity. 
Other secondary endpoints included time to first relapse, proportion of subjects free of relapse, ARR, 
EDSS score, Fatigue and Quality of life. Cognition and time to disability progression as well as further 
MRI related endpoints were assessed as exploratory endpoints. 
Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and regression models for the comparisons between 
Tecfidera and Avonex (logistic regression for response endpoints, negative binomial regression for count 
data,  time-to-event  methods).  Analyses  were  primarily  performed  based  on  the  patients  with  non-
missing data. As pre-specified primary analysis, providing descriptive statistics for the primary endpoint 
by treatment arm was specified. No confirmatory hypothesis test for comparing Tecfidera and Avonex 
was  pre-planned,  neither  for  superiority  nor  for  non-inferiority.  This  includes  that  no  procedure  for 
multiplicity  adjustment  was  specified.  Furthermore,  statistical  analyses  for  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints  were  not  specified  in  full  details  in  study  protocol  or  statistical  analysis  plan.  The  primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint and several of the analyses of secondary endpoints were based on the 
Completers population (or patients with MRI data at the respective visit). Analyses based on the patients 
with non-missing data is not according to usual standards as it may lead to a relevant selection bias. 
Sensitivity analyses based on the ITT-population were conducted but methods for missing data handling

in  these  analyses  were  not  pre-specified  and  it  is  not  clear  in  how  far  the  results  depend  on  the 
assumptions that were made for missing data.  
In summary, the analyses should be considered descriptive and do not provide confirmatory evidence of 
efficacy for Tecfidera in the paediatric population.   
The study has been conducted in an open-label design, which is comprehensible, as in case of the use 
of an injectable drug as comparator in a paediatric setting, a DB, double-dummy design to blind the two 
formulations (Tecfidera oral vs- e.g. IFN-ß) is not justified when Tecfidera treated patients would have 
been  required  to  take  additional  placebo  intramuscular  injections  once  a  week.  As  MRI  scans  were 
transferred electronically, read and interpreted by an independent blinded assessment centre, bias for 
the assessment of the primary endpoint can be excluded. Based on the Applicant´s responses to the 
RSI, it is considered that any potential bias from de-blinding the examining neurologist to the clinical 
endpoints, e.g. relapse confirmation, was limited. In addition, as the outcome on clinical relapses and 
data for new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, both representing disease activity, were concordant in the 
two  treatment  arms,  the  measures  taken  to  maintain  the  blind  for  the  assessment  of  the  clinical 
endpoints are expected to have been sufficient, although no explicit information is given, whether e.g. 
injection sites had to be sufficiently covered, to maintain the blind as far as possible. Overall, also taking 
into consideration, that the ARR has been evaluated as a secondary endpoint in this open label study, 
the blinding could be considered acceptable. 
Overall, the number of patients who had at least 1 major protocol deviation is considerably high with 
126  out  of  150  patients  (84%).  16  patients  (11%)  had  major  “efficacy  criteria”-related  protocol 
deviations,  84  patients  (56%)  had  major  protocol  deviations  related  to  “study  procedure  criteria”. 
However, the latter also might have been related to the efficacy outcome, e.g. incorrect order or wrong 
timespan for steroid-treatment and conduct of MRI after a relapse had occurred. With the response to 
the  RSI,  the  Applicant  clarified,  that  no  sites  or  participants  were  excluded  from  the  analyses  due  to 
protocol deviations  based on  internal  protocol  deviation  review  procedures.  In addition,  the  Applicant 
provided post hoc per-protocol analyses for the primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoint and the 
ARR in line with those that have been performed in the adult studies for Tecfidera, study 109MS301 and 
study  109MS302.  These  per  protocol  analyses  considered  inclusion  and  compliance  criteria  to 
demonstrate  that  the  amount  of  protocol  deviations  in  study  109MS306  did  not  impact  the  efficacy 
results.  Results  of  the  provided  analyses  were  overall  consistent  with  those  performed  in  the  ITT 
population.  Although  the  provided  PP  analyses  considered  only  some  specific  categories  of  major 
deviations, it is not expected that further analyses would differ from the provided analyses. Therefore, 
the  number  of  major  protocol  deviations  in  study  109MS306  is  not  expected  to  influence  the  overall 
efficacy  results  to  a  relevant  extent,  in  addition,  respective  protocol  deviations  were  well  distributed 
across both treatment groups. 
No  subgroup  analyses  have  been  pre-specified.  Given  the  overall  small  number  of  patients  in  both 
treatment arms, this is considered acceptable. 
The Applicant also provided a comparison of clinical efficacy in the paediatric population against young 
adults,  aged  18  to  25  years.  Data  for  young  adults  are  based  on  the  pooled  analyses  for  studies 
109MS301  and  109MS302  in  adults.  Although neither  the  pooled  analyses  for  studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302  nor  the  subgroup  analyses  for  young  adults  were  pre-specified,  they  provide  supportive 
information. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Of  the  156  randomised  patients,  150  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment  (ITT 
Population): 72 patients under Avonex and 78 patients under Tecfidera treatment. 
Assessment report

The completion rate of treatment at week 96  was 69% (n= 103 patients) in the ITT population (150 
patients). More patients in the Tecfidera group (61 patients, 78%) than in the Avonex group (42 patients, 
58%) completed treatment. The most common reasons for study treatment discontinuation were consent 
withdrawn  (15  patients,  10%),  AE  (14  patients,  9%),  and  Investigator  decision  (13  patients,  9%). 
Treatment  discontinuation  due  to  “consent  withdrawn”  and  “investigator  decision”  was  higher  in  the 
Avonex treatment group when compared to Tecfidera treatment [11 (15%) versus 4 (5%), and 9 (13%) 
versus  4  (5%),  respectively]  while  a  comparable  percentage  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups 
discontinued treatment because of an “adverse event” (Avonex: 8 patients, 11%; Tecfidera: 6 patients, 
8%). Treatment discontinuation due to the aspect “lack of efficacy” has not been assessed. However, 
according  to  the  Applicant  who  referred  to  the  free-text  entries  under  the  heading  “reason  for 
discontinuation of treatment” as part of “subject disposition and reasons for discontinuation of treatment 
and/or  withdrawal  from  study”,  the  following  terms  indicate  medication  ineffectiveness  or  disease 
progression: “MS relapse,” “relapse(s),” “MS worsening,” “progression of MS,” “progression of disease,” 
“ineffectiveness,”  “new  lesions  on  MRI,”  “MRI  progression,”  “lack  of  efficacy,”  “no  efficacy,”  and 
“iconographic aggravation.” Taken this into consideration, treatment discontinuation due to medication 
ineffectiveness or disease progression, both representing insufficient efficacy, was higher in the Avonex 
treatment group (12 patients, 17%) when compared to Tecfidera treatment (6 patients, 8%).  
The  proportion  of  patients  who  entered  Part  2  of  the  study  was  considerably  higher  in  the  Tecfidera 
treatment group as compared to treatment with Avonex (57 (73%) vs. 35 (49%), respectively). 
Demographic and disease characteristics overall were adequately balanced across the two groups and 
representative for the paediatric RRMS population. 
With regard to the primary analysis of the primary endpoint that has been performed in the Completers 
Population, the proportion of patients with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at week 
96  relative  to  baseline  was  higher  in  the  Tecfidera  group  (10  of  62  patients,  16.1%  [95%  Clopper-
Pearson exact CI: 8.0%, 27.7%]) than in the Avonex group with 2 of 41 patients, 4.9% [95% Clopper-
Pearson exact CI: 0.6%, 16.5%]. However, the primary analysis included a rather selected population, 
i.e., only patients who completed 96 weeks of treatment and who had a MRI at week 96. In particular, 
the differential drop-out (leading to imbalanced sample size of 41 under Avonex and 62 patients under 
Tecfidera) raises concerns on a relevant selection bias.    
In a “sensitivity analysis”, that has been performed in the ITT population, the proportion of patients with 
no  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions at  week  96  relative  to  baseline  was  higher  in  the 
Tecfidera group with 10 of 78 patients (12.8%) than in the Avonex group (2 of 72 patients, 2.8%). The 
OR for the proportion of patients with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at Week 96 in 
the Tecfidera group compared with the Avonex group was 6.99 (95% CI: 1.63, 49.88). This sensitivity 
analysis, including all randomised and treated patients without selection, is the analysis considered to 
be  of  most  relevance.  Missing  data  was  replaced  by  non-response  imputation  in  this  analysis.  The 
estimate  of  the  proportion  of  patients  with  no  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  lesions  relative  to  baseline 
under Tecfidera is conservative when using non-response imputation. However, for the comparison of 
Tecfidera vs Avonex, the non-response imputation may have led to bias in favour of Tecfidera because 
more data were missing for Avonex. Overall, while suggesting a trend in favour of Tecfidera, the results 
should be interpreted with caution. They should be considered descriptive and cannot be interpreted to 
confirm superiority of Tecfidera vs. Avonex because of methodological limitations (open-label design, no 
type 1 error control, methods not pre-specified in full details, particularly no method for missing data 
handling pre-specified).

With regard to secondary endpoints, the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on 
brain  MRI  scans  at  Week  96,  the  adjusted  mean  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense 
lesions was 32.65 (95% CI: 20.97, 50.85) for the Avonex group and 12.42 (95% CI: 8.79, 17.54) for 
the Tecfidera group, corresponding to a 61.96% reduction in the Tecfidera group compared to the Avonex 
group. However, as the analysis only included patients with MRI measurements at the given visit and 
excluded those without MRI measurements, these analyses have to be interpreted with caution, given 
that this is a selected population and bias due to differential selection in the two treatment arms cannot 
be excluded. 
In  addition,  two  sensitivity  analyses  (a)  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  hyperintense  lesions 
relative to baseline, Last Observation on/prior to the week 96 visit, b) number of new or newly enlarged 
T2 hyperintense lesions relative to baseline, Last Observation on/prior to the week 96 Visit, prior to the 
alternative medication have been performed. These analyses are considered more appropriate than the 
analyses based on the completers, as only patients without post-baseline data were excluded, which is 
still not ideal but means that less patients were excluded than in the completer analysis. The analysis 
addresses  the  hypothetical  effect  if  all  patients  completed  treatment  as  planned  (without  taking 
alternative medications) under a missing at random assumption. Both analyses showed a trend in favour 
of Tecfidera as well, but the difference in favour of Tecfidera was smaller than in the completer analysis. 
Overall, analyses on the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions were consistent with 
the primary endpoint analysis. However, as the proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging 
T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans is based on the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, 
this outcome is not unexpected. 
At week 96, the proportion of patients free of new MRI activity (i.e., free of Gd-enhancing and free of 
new or newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions on brain MRI scans) relative to baseline was higher in the Tecfidera 
group  (9  of  62  patients,  14.5%)  than  in  the  Avonex  group  with  2  of  42  patients  (4.8%)  (OR  for 
proportions: 8.76 (95% CI: 1.51, 81.44), indicating a better treatment effect for Tecfidera compared to 
Avonex. Overall, results were in line with those of the primary endpoint. However, again it has to be 
stressed, that the restriction of the analysis population to the patients who had an MRI at the given visit 
may result in a relevant selection bias that limits the overall conclusion. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  the  probability  for  clinical  relapse  was  34%  in  the  Tecfidera  group  and 
48% in the Avonex group during the 96-week open-label study period. The hazard ratio (HR) for relapse 
was 0.574 (95% CI: 0.329 to 1.001). In comparison to Avonex the time to first relapse was delayed in 
the Tecfidera treatment arm.  
At Week 96, the adjusted ARR for the Avonex group was 0.528 (95% CI: 0.333, 0.836), and 0.240 (95% 
CI: 0.147, 0.393) for the Tecfidera group (rate ratio 0.46, 95% CI (0.26,0.78). Generally, there was an 
obviously low relapse rate across both treatment groups. Most of the patients in both treatment arms 
experienced 0 relapses (Avonex 58%, Tecfidera 68%) up to week 96. 
As to be expected in the paediatric MS population with a generally rather low disability progression, no 
relevant changes in EDSS scores were seen from study start until the end of the 96 weeks period. Results 
for the EDSS score were only descriptively summarised: the mean (SD) EDSS score at baseline was 1.12 
(0.966) and 1.16 (1.074) for the Avonex and the Tecfidera treatment group, respectively, while at week 
96 the mean (SD) EDSS score was 1.19 (1.101) and 1.17 (1.217), respectively, representing almost no 
changes in EDSS score for both treatment groups. 
There were no trends in the mean or adjusted mean scores in any of the 3 fatigue dimensions (General 
Fatigue,  Sleep/Rest  Fatigue,  and  Cognitive  Fatigue)  during  the  study  in  either  the  participants’ 
assessments  or  the  parent/legal  guardians’  assessments.  The  mean  and  adjusted  mean  scores  were 
generally  similar  between  the  treatment  groups  and  similar  between  participant  and  parent/legal 
Assessment report

guardian  assessments.  There  were  no  trends  in  the  mean  or  adjusted  mean  scores  in  any  of  the  4 
dimensions  (Physical  Functioning,  Emotional  Functioning,  Social  Functioning,  and  School  Functioning) 
during the study in either the participants’ assessments or the parent/legal guardians’ assessments. 
Chronic or persistent T1-hypointense lesions (black holes) in MRI have been related to irreversible tissue 
loss  in  MS  patients.  Tecfidera  lead  to  nominal  reduction  in  the  mean  number  of  new  hypointense  T1 
lesions. 
At all visits, most of the patients in both treatment groups had no Gd-enhancing lesions with a generally 
higher proportion in the Tecfidera group than in the Avonex group. At Week 96 the mean number of Gd-
enhancing lesions was 1.3 under Avonex compared to 1.4 under Tecfidera. The OR of being in the group 
with  higher  Gd  lesions  in  the  Tecfidera  group  versus  Avonex  group  was  0.43  (95%  CI:  0.18,  1.03), 
reflecting  the  trend  that  patients  in  the  Tecfidera  group  tended  to  be  in  the  categories  with  less  Gd 
lesions compared to Avonex. From baseline, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the Avonex 
group declined from 3.58 to 1.3, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the Tecfidera group 
declined from 2.35 to 1.4 at week 96.  
A few patients experienced a confirmed disability progression as defined during the 96-week treatment 
period with 4 patients (6%) in the Avonex group and 7 (9%) patients under Tecfidera treatment. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  the  mean  BVMT-R  scores  at  Baseline  for  each  of  the  3  trials  and  mean 
changes from baseline for each of the 3 trials over time were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
Mean SDMT scores at Baseline were similar in the 2 treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline over 
time  were  higher  in  the  Tecfidera  group  than  in  the  Avonex  group.  At  Week  48,  the  percentage  of 
participants in both treatment groups who progressed to the next grade in school were the same (among 
those evaluated): Avonex, 38 of 41 participants (93%); Tecfidera, 56 of 60 participants (93%). At Week 
96, 49 of 57 participants (86%) evaluated in the Avonex group and 68 of 74 participants (92%) evaluated 
in the Tecfidera group progressed to the next grade in school. 
Regarding the consistency of the efficacy outcome of dimethyl fumarate in the paediatric population and 
young adults the provided post-hoc analyses seem to be consistent with those from the overall adult 
patient population and in favour of Tecfidera. It may therefore be assumed, based on the known clinical 
efficacy in adults, that the clinical efficacy in children is also alike that observed in adults.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Study 109MS306 Part1 included paediatric patients aged 10 to 18 years of age and therefore, no further 
data are needed. 
3.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In support of the extension of the indication of Tecfidera to paediatric patients aged 10 years and older 
(updated during the procedure to ‘13 years of age and older’), the Applicant has provided efficacy data 
from one open-label, active controlled study, study 109MS306 Part 1. 
Due to methodological limitations (including open-label design, no type 1 error control, methods not pre-
specified  in  full  details,  analyses  generally  not  based  on  ITT-population),  the  results  from  study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 58/152 
 
 
 
109MS306 Part 1 are considered descriptive and do not provide stand-alone confirmatory evidence of 
efficacy for Tecfidera in the paediatric RRMS population. 
However, results of the primary analysis for the primary endpoint, the “proportion of patients with no 
new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  at  week  96”,  performed  in  a  rather  selected  patient 
population, the Completers population, suggested a trend in favour of Tecfidera. This was supported by 
a sensitivity analysis based on the ITT population, including all randomised and treated patients without 
selection. Secondary MRI based endpoints, i.e. the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense 
lesions on brain MRI scans at Week 96, the proportion of patients free of new MRI activity (i.e., free of 
Gd-enhancing  and  free  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  MRI  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans)  and  the  mean 
number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions,  indicated  the  same  effect  in  favour  of  Tecfidera.  Since  these  MRI 
parameters  have  been  related  to  relapses,  representing  the  most  important  clinical  effect  in  this 
population and are often among the criteria chosen to reflect disease activity, they are considered to be 
of high importance in this context and extrapolation of efficacy based on these endpoints is accepted 
(reference is also made to the paediatric indication for Aubagio).  In addition, the outcome on relapses, 
evaluated  as  secondary  endpoints,  was  also  indicative  for  an  effect  of  Tecfidera  in  the  paediatric 
population. 
Regarding the consistency of the efficacy outcome of DMF in the paediatric population and young adults 
the provided analyses seem to be consistent with those from the overall adult patient population and in 
favour of Tecfidera.  
Overall, it is considered that the natural history of MS is rather comparable in children and adults and 
therefore, an independent confirmation of efficacy in paediatric patients is not necessary in a situation 
where efficacy that has already been established in adult RRMS patients. Consequently, the use Tecfidera 
in paediatric patients has been adequately documented from a clinical efficacy perspective. 
3.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of DMF deriving from clinical studies in adults at the time of marketing authorisation 
is detailed in the Tecfidera EPAR (EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1). Moreover, no increased incidence in 
AEs  has  been  observed  during  long-term  treatment  with  Tecfidera,  which  was  evaluated  in  the  long-
term  study  109MS303.  Results  with  a  data  cut-off  08  November  2019  were  evaluated  in  a  parallel 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G). 
Adverse events of special interest defined for Tecfidera are: 
•  Gastrointestinal  AEs:  the  incidence  of  AEs  associated  with  GI  tolerability  (mainly  diarrhoea, 
nausea,  abdominal  pain  upper,  abdominal  pain,  and  vomiting)  was  higher  in  DMF-treated 
subjects compared to placebo (31% placebo vs. 40% DMF 240mg BID; Pool A data).  
• 
Flushing and related symptoms (assumed to be mediated by prostaglandins): the incidence of 
AEs associated with flushing (including hot flush) and/or flushing-like events was higher in DMF-
treated subjects compared to placebo (9% placebo vs. 45% DMF 240mg BID; Pool A data). For 
both,  GI  tolerability  and  flushing  AEs,  these  occur  most  frequently  during  the  first  month  of 
treatment with DMF; these events may continue to occur intermittently throughout the treatment 
with Tecfidera. Temporary dose reduction (to 120 mg BID for up to 1 month) is advised in the 
SmPC to mitigate GI effects and flushing.

• 
Infections:  similar  rates  for  infections  in  DMF-treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo  were 
reported in Pool A (56% placebo vs. 60% DMF 240mg BID). Serious infections were reported by 
2%  of  patients  treated  with  DMF  240mg  BID  and  in  1%  of  patients  on  placebo.  Additional 
analyses performed for DMF phase 3 studies could not confirm a relation between the occurrence 
of  infections  and  the  subject’s  minimum  post-baseline  lymphocyte  counts.  According  to  the 
SmPC,  patients  with  serious  infections  should  not  start  treatment  with  Tecfidera  until  the 
infection(s) is resolved. 
•  Cardiovascular  disorders  were  not  found  different  in  patients  on  DMF  and  placebo  during  the 
phase 3 studies with Tecfidera. 
•  Hepatic disorders: The incidence of hepatic TEAEs was similar across treatment groups in Pool A 
(9% placebo vs. 9% DMF BID) and headed by elevations of liver transaminases. An increased 
incidence  of  elevated  liver  transaminases  (≥3x  ULN)  with  DMF  compared  to  placebo  was 
primarily due to differences that occurred early in the course of treatment, i.e. during the first 
6 months. 
•  Renal disorders: Preclinical studies specified the kidney as a target for DMF-toxicity. However, 
the incidences of AEs in the renal and urinary disorders SOC were similar in DMF-treated subjects 
and those on placebo (18% placebo vs. 19% DMF BID). Small increases in the incidence of AEs 
of  proteinuria,  microalbuminuria,  and  albumin  urine  present  were  observed  with  DMF  as 
compared to placebo in DMF safety pools, these events were mild to moderate in severity and 
did not lead to an increase in treatment discontinuations. No worsening in renal function was 
noted over time in DMF trials, including in the long-term study 109MS303 with DMF treatment 
of up to 12 years. 
•  Malignancies: the incidence of malignancies was low and balanced (<1% [3 subjects] placebo, 
<1% [2 subjects] DMF BID) in Pool A. The long-term risk for malignancies with DMF treatment 
has been further assessed in study 109MS303, with the overall incidence being 3%. Malignancies 
are a potential risk with DMF in the RMP. 
•  Suicide  and  depression:  occurred  in  a  low  and  similar  incidence  across  treatment  groups  in 
Tecfidera clinical studies in adults. It should be noted that patients with multiple sclerosis have 
an increased prevalence of depression and an elevated risk of suicide. 
A number of safety signals emerged for DMF after approval:  
A safety signal for progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) has been identified early after approval 
of Tecfidera following the first confirmed and also fatal case of PML in a patient with severe prolonged 
lymphopenia  (>  3.5 years)  in  a  clinical  study.  The  risk  for  PML  has  been  taken  up  in  a  number  of 
procedures either from a mechanistical perspective (lymphocytopenia) or based on additional confirmed 
cases  (including  EMEA/H/C/WS0689/G,  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0026,  EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0030, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/R/0053, 
EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0030, 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/54/G, 
EMEA/H/C/2601/II/58,  and  EMEA/H/C/2601/II/63).  So  far,  11  PML  cases  have  been  confirmed  for 
Tecfidera, which all occurred in patients with lymphocyte counts below LLN (<0.91x109/L), and 10 of 
these cases occurred in the postmarketing setting. Substantial amendments have been introduced in the 
product  information of  Tecfidera,  including  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  suspected  or  confirmed 
PML,  detailed  warnings  (stopping  rules,  additional  factors  that  might  increase  the  risk  for  PML  and 
demand increased vigilance), and description of study findings for lymphocyte subsets in section 4.8.  
Lymphopenia seems to increase the risk for PML. Therefore, the mechanism of decreases in lymphocyte 
counts has been evaluated in nonclinical and clinical studies. While nonclinical investigations ruled out 
selective  toxicity  of  DMF  and  MMF  on  human  lymphocytes  during  Tecfidera  treatment,  a  mechanistic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 60/152 
 
 
 
rational  for  the  effect  of  DMF  on  lymphocytes  could  not  be  deduced  from  clinical  studies.  However, 
quantitative and qualitative changes within the lymphocyte subpopulations (specifically CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells) in DMF - treated patients have been observed in study 109MS310, for which results are included 
in section 4.8 of the Tecfidera SmPC. Given the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the immunological 
defence  against  opportunistic  infections,  it  is  mechanistically  plausible  that  loss  of  these  subsets 
enhances the susceptibility for PML. In particular, the decline of CD8+ T cells has recently been related 
to the pharmacological activation of the Nrf2 pathway and also to the stimulation of phosphoinositide 3 
kinase-Akt signalling by DMF1516. 
A  safety  signal  of  drug-induced  liver  injury  (DILI)  related  to  Tecfidera  treatment  was  reported  in  the 
postmarketing setting, including liver enzyme increase (≥ 3x ULN) and elevation of total bilirubin levels 
(≥ 2x ULN). The weighted cumulative evidence that derived from a review of data was deemed sufficient 
to support a causal association between hepatotoxicity and Tecfidera. Thus, a warning on these hepatic 
findings and monitoring requirements as well as respective ADRs have been included in sections 4.4 and 
4.8 of the Tecfidera SmPC. DILI is further included as an important identified risk in the Tecfidera RMP. 
Safety  signals  of  overdose,  anaphylaxis  and  thrombocytopenia  were  reported  in  the  postmarketing 
experience and relevant information has been included in the Tecfidera product information. 
Herpes zoster was reported as a postmarketing safety signal for Tecfidera and adequate warning and 
description of this ADR and its presentation has been added in the PI to also include that in a majority 
of patients concurrent lymphocyte counts met the criteria of moderate to severe lymphopenia. Recently, 
cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported for a DMF-containing product in combination with other 
fumaric acid esters, while no such case derived from treatment with Tecfidera. However, given that MMF 
appears  to  be  the  component  of  interest,  which  derives  from  both  drug  products,  this  warning  was 
deemed adequate for Tecfidera. 
For DMF, two paediatric studies in patients aged 13 to <18 years have been conducted, i.e. a 24-week, 
open-label, prospective, uncontrolled study in 22 paediatric patients with RRMS (109MS202 with focus 
on  pharmacokinetics)  and  its  96-week  extension  (109MS311).  Study  109MS202  as  well  as  study 
109MS311 are not part of the Tecfidera PIP. Results from these two studies based on a limited number 
of  subjects  demonstrated  an  acceptable  safety  profile  for  paediatric  patients  with  RRMS,  which  is 
consistent with the safety profile established in the adult population. Description of these data is included 
in the product information for Tecfidera. 
Patient exposure 
Disposition of patients 
For detailed information, please see efficacy part of this AR in 3.4.2. (Table 2). 
69% of patients (103 of 150 patients) in the ITT Population completed 96 weeks of treatment in Part 1 
of the study: 78% of patients on Tecfidera (61 patients)and 58% of patients on Avonex (42 patients).  
The most common reasons for study treatment discontinuation were consent withdrawn (10% in total, 
15% on Avonex and 5% on Tecfidera), AEs (9% in total, 11% on Avonex and 8% on Tecfidera), and 
Investigator decision (9% in total, 13% on Avonex and 5% on Tecfidera).

The ITT Population (n=150) included all participants who were randomly assigned to a treatment group 
and received at least 1 dose of study treatment: Avonex, 72 patients; Tecfidera, 78 patients.  
67% of patients were female (n=101). The mean (SD) age was 14.9 (1.62) years. Stratification of the 
ITT population was performed according to age: 
•  10 to less than 13 years: 15 patients in total, 10% (8 patients [11%] on Avonex, 7 patients on 
Tecfidera [9%]) 
•  13 to less than 15 years: 32 patients in total, 21% (14 patients [19%] on Avonex, 18 patients 
on Tecfidera [23%]) 
•  15 to less than 18 years: 103 patients in total, 69% (50 patients [69%] on Avonex, 53 patients 
on Tecfidera [68%]). 
Tanner staging is described in more detail under “Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations 
related to safety” below. Screening results are depicted in Table 5. 
Mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.5 (4.42) kg/m² and mean body weight was 63.88 (14.576) kg. 
Other baseline demographic and disease parameters are detailed in Table 4 and Table 6. 
Extent of exposure 
The mean (SD) exposure to study treatment overall was 78.6 (29.58) weeks, and higher in the Tecfidera 
(84.4 [26.01] weeks) than in the Avonex group (72.3 [32.02] weeks) (Table 24). The majority of patients 
were exposed to study treatment between 88 and 96 weeks (Avonex 58% and Tecfidera 65%). 
The mean (SD) percentage of study treatment taken was similar in both groups: Avonex 87.4% (18.43) 
and Tecfidera 85.6% (15.45).

Patients who completed Week 96 in Part 1 and met the Part 2 entry could receive open-label Tecfidera 
240 mg BID for 240 weeks in the Part 2 extension phase. 61% of patients (n=92) continued into Part 2 
of  the  study  (35  patients  on  Avonex  [49%]  and  57  patients  on  Tecfidera  [73%]).  Part 2  of  Study 
109MS306 is currently ongoing. 
Adverse events 
The  following  safety  assessments  were  performed:  AE  monitoring,  clinical  laboratory  analyses 
(haematology,  blood  coagulation,  chemistry,  urinalysis,  endocrine,  and  urine  cytology),  physical 
examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECGs). 
Patient narratives were provided for SAEs (n=18) and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (n=8) and are 
discussed in the respective sections.

(b) Related as assessed by the investigator 
The number of patients with at least one TEAE during Part 1 of the study was similar in the Avonex and 
Tecfidera group (96% and 95%, respectively). In a majority of patients from both groups, TEAEs were 
rated  as  related  to  treatment  (Avonex:  82%,  Tecfidera:  86%).  Slightly  more  patients  on  Avonex  as 
compared to Tecfidera experienced a treatment-emergent SAE (29% vs. 23%). Treatment-related SAEs 
were reported in more patients from the Tecfidera group as compared to Avonex (5% vs. 1%). Events 
leading to drug withdrawal or discontinuation from study were higher in the Avonex group as compared 
to Tecfidera (11% vs. 6%). No death occurred during the study. 
Display of AEs 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC (≥25% of patients in either treatment group Avonex and 
Tecfidera) were: nervous system disorders (69% and 62%), infections and infestations (50% and 62%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (31% and 74%), general disorders and administration site conditions (78% 
and 27%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (38% and 26%), vascular disorders (8% and 
46%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (11% and 32%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (6% and 33%).

The most common TEAEs in the Tecfidera group were abdominal pain (41%), flushing (38%), MS relapse 
(35%),  headache  (28%),  nasopharyngitis  (23%),  and  vomiting  (23%).  The  majority  of  patients 
experiencing TEAEs had events assessed as mild or moderate in severity. Severe TEAEs were reported 
in 9% of patients (14% in the Avonex group and 4% in the Tecfidera group). Severe TEAEs that occurred 
in > 1% of patients in either treatment group were MS relapse (4% in each treatment group), headache 
and influenza-like illness (3% each; only in the Avonex group). 
Analysis  of  TEAEs  by  time  interval  (week  0-48  and  week  >48-96)  revealed  a  similar  incidence  of  GI 
disorders and nervous system disorders TEAEs in both intervals in the Tecfidera group, while flushing 
occurred with a higher incidence in the first year of treatment. 
The most frequent treatment-related TEAEs overall were influenza-like illness (24%), flushing (20%), 
abdominal pain and headache (15% each), pyrexia (10%), and upper abdominal pain (8%), diarrhoea 
(6%), and erythema and rash (5% each). Of these, influenza-like illness (only in the Avonex group), 
headache, and pyrexia were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the Avonex group than the 
Tecfidera group. Flushing (reported only in the Tecfidera group), abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain 
(reported only in the Tecfidera group), diarrhoea, and erythema and rash (reported only in the Tecfidera 
group) were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the Tecfidera group than the Avonex group. 
The TEAEs of abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain in the Tecfidera group were all mild or moderate 
in severity. In the Tecfidera treatment group, no patient experienced GI-related AEs that led to study 
treatment discontinuation. 
Post-hoc safety analysis - Overview of Paediatric - Adult Safety Outcomes in Tecfidera Studies 
Table 27 summarises comparative safety events from Study 109MS306 Part 1 (paediatric data) and the 
controlled studies of Tecfidera in adults (PTs are based on the Tecfidera Investigator’s Brochure, Version 
17). In general, the frequencies of the events and the overall safety profiles were similar. An apparent 
increased frequency of some GI disorders (vomiting and dyspepsia) and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (rash and erythema) was seen in Study 109MS306 Part 1 compared with the controlled studies 
of Tecfidera in adults. 
The numerical differences in the reported GI disorders TEAEs and TEAEs of rash or erythema between 
Study 109MS306 Part 1 and the placebo-controlled adult pivotal clinical studies are thought to reflect 
differences in study design and do not change the established safety profile for Tecfidera.

Adverse events of special interest 
include flushing and other related symptoms, GI tolerability (nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, etc.), 
infections,  including  potential  opportunistic  infections,  ischemic  cardiovascular  disorders,  hepatic 
disorders, renal disorders, malignancies, and lymphopenia and leukopenia. 
Overall, 126 patients (84%; Avonex 74%; Tecfidera 94%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent 
AESI (see Table 28). Treatment-emergent AESIs occurred in a higher percentage in the Tecfidera group 
as compared to Avonex in the following SOCs: GI disorders (74% and 31%), infections and infestations 
(53% and 42%), vascular disorders (46% and 7%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (28% 
and 7%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (28% and 1%), investigations (4% and 3%), blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (3% and 0%), and cardiac disorders (3% and 0%). Treatment-emergent 
AESIs  occurred  in  a  higher  percentage  in  the  Avonex  group  as  compared  to  Tecfidera  group  in  the 
following SOCs: general disorders and administration site conditions (42% and 19%), musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (13% and 3%), and renal and urinary disorders (10% and 5%).  
Treatment-emergent AESIs by PT in >20% of patients and in a greater percentage of patients in the 
Tecfidera  group  than  the  Avonex  group  are:  abdominal  pain  (Avonex  7%;  Tecfidera  41%),  flushing 
(Avonex  1%;  Tecfidera  38%),  nasopharyngitis  (Avonex  13%;  Tecfidera  23%),  and  vomiting  (Avonex 
8%; Tecfidera 23%). AESIs of pyrexia were reported in a greater percentage of patients in the Avonex 
(24%) than the Tecfidera group (10%).

TEAEs of lymphopenia were reported in 2 patients (3%) in the Tecfidera group. One of the cases was a 
severe  SAE  considered  related  to  treatment  by  the  Investigator  (patient  100-004).  The  SAE  of 
lymphopenia occurred at the same time as an SAE of tonsillitis (also considered severe and treatment-
related);  both  events  resulted  in  the  patient  being  admitted  to  hospital.  On  the  date  of  hospital 
admission, the patient’s lymphocyte count was 400 cells/μL (reference range: 950 to 5250 cells/μL), and 
the following day the count was 300 cells/μL. Subsequent values were as follows, both within normal 
limits:  1400  cells/μL  (3  days  after  hospital  admission)  and  2100  cells/μL  (4  days  after  admission). 
Treatment was interrupted due to the SAEs (for approximately 14 days). On the fourth day after hospital 
admission  both  events  were  considered  resolved  and  the  patient  was  discharged  from  hospital.  The 
patient’s  final  lymphocyte  count  provided  by  the  hospital  (12  days  after  resolution  of  the  SAE  of 
lymphopenia) was 2000 cells/μL. Because the lymphocyte counts collected by the hospital were not part 
of a study visit, the results were not recorded in the patient’s eCRF, and therefore the patient was not 
included  in  the  set  of  patients  with  postbaseline  lymphocyte  counts  <  0.5  x  109/L.  The  patient’s 
lymphocyte counts at all clinic visits during the study were within the normal range, including the value 
approximately 2 weeks before the onset of the SAEs (1.47 × 109/L). 
No patient experienced a TEAE of leukopenia. 
Resolution  of  6  specific  AESI  PTs  (flushing,  nausea,  abdominal  pain,  lower  abdominal  pain,  upper 
abdominal pain, and diarrhoea) was of interest. A total of 69 of the 150 patients in the ITT Population 
(46%; Avonex: 17%; Tecfidera: 73%) experienced 1 or more of these PT events (Avonex: 27 events; 
Tecfidera: 256 events); all of the events in the Avonex group resolved during the study, except for a 
single event of flushing. More events in the Tecfidera group were not resolved by the end of the study, 
i.e. 8 events of flushing, 2 events of abdominal pain, and 2 events of abdominal pain upper. 
Gastrointestinal disorders (and vascular disorders) 
In Table 26, the most commonly reported TEAEs within the GI disorders SOC in the Tecfidera group were 
abdominal pain (41%), vomiting (23%), diarrhoea (19%), upper abdominal pain (18%), nausea (17%), 
dyspepsia (10%), and constipation (6%). All TEAEs in the GI disorders SOC in Study 109MS306 Part 1 
were of (mainly) mild or moderate severity, and none resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
The incidence of GI disorders and vascular disorders in the Tecfidera group decreased over time: the 
incidence of TEAEs within the GI disorders SOC tended to decrease from 25% of patients (Weeks 0 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 68/152 
 
 
 
 
48) to 17% of patients (Weeks 48 to 96), and the incidence of vascular disorders decreased from 14% 
of patients (Weeks 0 to 48) to 2% of patients (Weeks 48 to 96). 
Malignancies 
No malignancies were reported during the study Part 1. 
Pregnancies 
No pregnancies were reported during the study Part 1. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported during Part 1 of the study. 
Serious adverse events occurred in 29% of patients in the Avonex group and in 23% of patients in the 
Tecfidera group (Table 29). The only treatment-emergent SAE reported by > 1% of patients in either 
treatment group was MS relapse (25% in the Avonex group and 17% in the Tecfidera group). 3% in 
total had an SAE that was considered related to study treatment: influenza-like illness in a single patient 
on Avonex (1%) and in 5% of patients on Tecfidera (lymphopenia and tonsillitis both in the same patient, 
and upper abdominal pain, MS relapse, and pruritic rash, each in 1 other patient). 
The Applicant provided narratives of the SAEs.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
including  haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  red  blood  cell  count,  WBC  count  (with  differential),  and  platelet 
count. 
Mean haematology parameters over time 
In  the  Tecfidera  group,  mean  leukocyte  counts  decreased  from  baseline  to  Week  8.  The  decrease 
remained  generally  stable  through  Week  84;  the  mean  increased  at  Week  96  (remaining  below  the 
baseline mean). Overall in both treatment groups, mean leukocyte counts were variable yet remained 
within normal range throughout the study. 
Mean lymphocyte counts in the Tecfidera group decreased from baseline (~2.0 x 109/L) through Week 
48 (1.6 × 109/L), plateauing through Week 60, and then increasing through Week 96 (but remaining 
below  baseline  mean);  the  mean  returned  to  baseline  at  the  follow-up  visit  at  Week  100.  Mean 
lymphocyte values in the Tecfidera group remained above LLN during Part 1 of the study (Figure 3). In 
the Avonex group, mean lymphocyte values postbaseline were slightly increased from baseline through 
Week 100. 
Mean neutrophil values in the Tecfidera group decreased from baseline through Week 8; by Week 36 the 
mean had returned to within the normal range, plateauing through Week 84. The mean value increased 
again at Week 96 (the last visit of the treatment period), decreasing again at the follow-up visit at Week 
100. In the Avonex group mean neutrophil values postbaseline were all below baseline levels through 
Week 96, returning to near baseline values at Week 100. 
There  were  no  trends  in  mean  change  from  baseline  values  in  erythrocyte  counts,  haemoglobin, 
haematocrit,  or  platelet  counts  or  in  coagulation  parameters  PTT,  prothrombin  time,  or  INR  in  either 
treatment group at Weeks 24, 48, or 96.

Figure 3: Lymphocyte Mean Values (± SE) Over Time for Paediatric Tecfidera Patients (Study 109MS306) 
No participants experienced lymphocyte counts < 500 (x106/L), sustained for at least 6 months (24 weeks), or between 500 and 
800 (x106/L), sustained for at least 6 months. All assessments, including unscheduled visits were used to classify participants in the 
above categories. LLN is lower limit in std unit. If there are multiple values of LLN for a give parameter, highest LLN is shown. SE= 
Standard Error; BL=Baseline; Lymphocyte < LLN: lymphocyte value recorded at visit was less than the lower limit of the normal 
range.  
Clinically significant values 
Notable  potentially  clinically  significant  haematology  abnormalities  in  either  treatment  group  were 
lymphocytes  <0.8  ×  109/L  (Avonex  4%;  Tecfidera  19%),  lymphocytes  <0.5  ×  109/L  (Avonex  1%; 
Tecfidera 4%), and total WBC < 3.0 × 109/L (Avonex: 0%; Tecfidera 13%). 
Lymphocytes 
A total of 4 patients experienced postbaseline lymphocyte counts < 0.5 x 109/L during the study (based 
on values collected at study visits only): 1 patient in the Avonex group and 3 patients in the Tecfidera 
group: 
The patient in the Avonex group had 6 lymphocyte values < LLN between Weeks 24 and 72. Between 
the Week 48 and Week 72 visits there were 3 lymphocyte values < 0.5 × 109/L (0.37, 0.48, and 0.47× 
109/L at the Week 48, 60, and 72 visits, respectively); other values in that time period ranged from 1.19 
× 109/L to 1.38 × 109/L.  
One patient on Tecfidera had a single value < 0.5 × 109/L (0.47 × 109/L) at the Week 100 (follow-up) 
visit (other values within normal range). The second patient had lymphocyte values < LLN from Week 
12 through 96 (except for a single normal value). Between the Week 36 and Week 72 visits the patient 
had five values < 0.5 × 109/L (0.34 - 0.46 × 109/L); other values in that time period ranged from 0.51 
×  109/L  to  1.01  ×  109/L.  The  third  patient  had  lymphocyte  values  <  LLN  from  Week  12  through  96. 
Between the Week 36 and Week 72 visits there were 3 lymphocyte values < 0.5 × 109/L (0.40 - 0.49 × 
109/L); other values in that time period were 0.52 × 109/L and 0.54 × 109/L.

None  of  these  4  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  or  withdrew  from  the  study  because  of  low 
lymphocytes,  and  no  TEAEs  of  lymphopenia  were  reported  for  any  of  them.  No  patient  experienced 
postbaseline lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L lasting for > 6 months. 
Lymphocyte values over time and disposition from the study were evaluated for the subset of patients 
in the ITT Population who had a lymphocyte count < LLN sometime during the study and in addition 1) 
completed Part 1 of the study and did not enter Part 2, 2) permanently discontinued treatment during 
Part 1, and/or 3) had a dose interruption at least once during Part 1. Among this subset of patients, a 
total  of  10  patients  (Avonex:  3;  Tecfidera:  7)  experienced  lymphocyte  values  <  LLN  at  1  or  more 
postbaseline clinic visits during the study. Among the 7 patients in the Tecfidera group, 2 completed Part 
1, 2 had a dose interruption, and 3 discontinued study treatment (1 of whom also had a dose interruption 
during treatment).  
Post-hoc safety analysis - paediatric-Adult Lymphocyte Counts in Tecfidera Studies 
The lymphocyte dynamics in the Study 109MS306 (Part 1) population were similar to those observed in 
the  adult  population  (Pool  B).  Pool  B  represents  the  combined  placebo-controlled  and  uncontrolled 
studies  of  Tecfidera  in  adults  with  MS,  consisting  of  participants  from  the  placebo-controlled  Studies 
109MS301, 109MS302, and C-1900 (Part 1), with added newly treated participants from the uncontrolled 
extension Studies C-1900 (Part 2) and Study 109MS303. In both, Study 109MS306 and Pool B, the mean 
baseline  lymphocyte  counts  were  approximately  2.0  ×  109  cells/L,  which  decreased  over  the  first 
48 weeks  with  subsequent  plateaus.  In  Study  109MS306,  the  mean  lymphocyte  counts  decreased  by 
about  20%  but  remained  above  the  LLN  during  the  study.  In  Pool  B,  the  mean  lymphocyte  counts 
decreased by approximately 30%. Numerical differences between Study 109MS306 and Pool B (in %- 
decrease) are likely explained by the small numbers of patients in Study 109MS306 and are not thought 
to be meaningful. No patient in 109MS306 developed prolonged, severe lymphopenia or discontinued 
treatment  due  to  prolonged  lymphopenia;  therefore,  SmPC  criteria  remain  appropriate  for  paediatric 
patients.  
Analysis of shifts 
A relevant shift to high values happened for eosinophils (Avonex 20%; Tecfidera 36%) and neutrophils 
(Avonex 14%; Tecfidera 12%). The parameters in which a shift to low values happened were monocytes 
(Avonex 73%; Tecfidera 70%), leukocytes (Avonex 28%; Tecfidera 41%), lymphocytes (Avonex 7%; 
Tecfidera 27%), erythrocytes (Avonex 14%; Tecfidera 23%), haemoglobin (Avonex 7%; Tecfidera 13%), 
and haematocrit (Avonex 16%; Tecfidera 22%). 
Blood chemistry 
Blood chemistry was performed: sodium, potassium, chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, 
AST, GGT, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, and 
glucose. 
There were no trends in changes from baseline for any chemistry parameters in either treatment group, 
except for alkaline phosphatase. There was a decrease from baseline in mean alkaline phosphatase levels 
in both treatment groups, but the mean values did not go below normal levels. 
Liver enzymes 
The incidence of patients with ALT values > ULN by treatment group over time was as follows: 
- Baseline: Avonex 6%; Tecfidera 5% 
- Week 4: Avonex 10%; Tecfidera 16% (3% of patients had ALT > 3x ULN) 
- Week 48: Avonex 5%; Tecfidera 3% 
- Week 96: Avonex 5%; Tecfidera 0%

The incidence of patients with AST values > ULN by treatment group over time was as follows: 
- Baseline: Avonex 7%; Tecfidera 1% 
- Week 48: Avonex 4%; Tecfidera 1% 
- Week 96: Avonex 3%; Tecfidera 0% 
The incidence of patients shifting from normal at baseline to above normal postbaseline in liver enzymes 
were similar for Avonex and Tecfidera; shifts to ALT > ULN occurred most often (18% or 19%), followed 
by shifts to AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin > ULN (6% to 8%). 
A total of 10 patients (5 in each of the treatment groups) experienced postbaseline ALT or AST ≥3x ULN, 
postbaseline  bilirubin  >  2x  ULN,  or  postbaseline  alkaline  phosphatase  >  1.5x  ULN  during  the  study. 
Three patients in the Avonex group and 2 patients in the Tecfidera group had postbaseline AST or ALT 
values > 3x ULN, and 1 patient in the Tecfidera group had postbaseline total bilirubin values > 2x ULN. 
Two  patients  in  the  Avonex  group  and  2  patients  in  the  Tecfidera  group  had  postbaseline  alkaline 
phosphatase values > 1.5× ULN. One patient in the Tecfidera group experienced a TEAE of ALT increased 
and 1 patient experienced a TEAE of blood bilirubin increased. No patients in either treatment group had 
postbaseline ALT or AST values > 3× ULN and bilirubin > 2× ULN (Hy’s Law criteria). 
Other blood chemistry tests 
No clinically notable changes in mean values for any other blood chemistry tests (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, urea nitrogen, creatinine, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, glucose, and urate) 
over  time.  The  parameters  in  which  a  shift  to  high  values  happened  in  >  25%  of  patients  in  either 
treatment  group  were  calcium  (Avonex  18%;  Tecfidera  26%),  magnesium  (Avonex  57%;  Tecfidera 
59%), and glucose (Avonex 39%; Tecfidera 34%). The only parameters in which a shift to low values 
happened in > 25% of patients in either treatment group was glucose (Avonex 18%; Tecfidera 26%). 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis was performed: colour, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, blood, ketones, and microscopy. 
There were no trends in changes from any urinalysis values in either treatment group. 
A shift to high values occurred for the following parameters in > 25% of patients in either treatment 
group: ketones (Avonex 14%; Tecfidera 59%), occult blood (Avonex 40%; Tecfidera 44%), and protein 
(Avonex 81%; Tecfidera 92%). Proteinuria was reported as a TEAE in 3% of patients on Tecfidera (6% 
on Avonex). 
Endocrinology 
Endocrine tests were performed at baseline, Weeks 48 and 96, and Early Withdrawal (until patient had 
reached bone age of ≥ 16 years or until patient was postmenarche): insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin-
like growth factor binding protein, FSH, LH, estradiol (E-2), and testosterone. Data were collected for 17 
patients at Baseline, 12 patients at Week 48, and 9 patients at Week 96. No clinically relevant trends 
were observed. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs 
Mean  temperature,  pulse  rate,  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP),  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP),  and 
respiratory rate remained generally stable throughout the study, and there were no trends in (percent) 
changes from baseline measurements. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 73/152 
 
 
 
 
The  most  common  clinically  relevant  vital  sign  abnormalities  were  high  pulse rate  (>  120  bpm  or  an 
increase from baseline of > 20 bpm) in 24% of patients on Avonex and 31% of patients on Tecfidera, 
low  pulse  rate  (<  50  bpm  or  a  decrease  from  baseline  of  >  20  bpm)  in  17%  and  18%  of  patients, 
respectively, and low DBP (< 50 mmHg or a decrease from baseline of > 20 mmHg) in 11% and 10% 
of  patients,  respectively.  With  the  exception  of  high  pulse  rate  (higher  in  the  Tecfidera  group),  the 
percentages of patients experiencing each type of clinically relevant abnormality were generally similar 
across both treatment groups. 
Clinically relevant abnormalities in vital signs were stratified by patient age < 13 years and ≥13 years. 
In both treatment groups, more patients < 13 years as compared to those ≥13 years had a pulse rate 
< 50 bpm or a decrease from baseline of > 20 bpm (Avonex: 25% and 16%; Tecfidera: 29% and 17%), 
and a SBP >130mmHg/ >140mmHg (Avonex: 25% and 5%; Tecfidera: 14% and 1%). More patients < 
13 years  as  compared  to  ≥13 years,  specifically  in  the  Tecfidera  group,  had  a  DBP  >80mmHg/ 
>90mmHg of > 20 bpm (14% and 4%). 
ECGs 
Most  patients  had  normal  ECG  results  throughout  the  study  (ranging  from  91%  to  97%  of  patients 
evaluated  across  study  visits,  including  follow-up).  No  patients  had  an  abnormal  ECG  result  that  was 
considered to be an AE. A higher percentage of patients had an abnormal (not AE) ECG result at baseline 
in  the  Tecfidera  group  (12%)  than  the  Avonex  group  (4%),  but  at  other  treatment  period  visits,  the 
percentage of patients with an abnormal (not AE) ECG result was similar across treatment groups. No 
patient  experienced  a  shift  from  normal  ECG  to  abnormal,  AE.  A  total  of  11  of  135  patients  (8%) 
experienced a shift from normal ECG to abnormal, not AE: Avonex, 4 of 68 patients, 6%; Tecfidera, 7 
of 67 patients, 10%. 
Growth parameters and Tanner staging 
According to the study protocol, the following clinical assessments were performed to assess the safety 
profile of Tecfidera: 
Physical examinations, including body weight, height, and Tanner Stage. Information regarding Tanner 
staging  was  collected  at  baseline  for  all  male  participants  and  for  female  participants  who  were 
premenarche  until  the  participant’s  bone  age  reached  ≥  16 years  or  once  the  participant  was 
postmenarche. According to study activities in the protocol, Tanner score was also assessed at Week 48 
and at end of Part 1 of the study/ early withdrawal visit. 
At screening, 3 out of 49 male subjects (6%; 2 patients on Avonex and 1 patient on Tecfidera) and 1 
out of 101 female subject (<1%; patient was on Avonex) were pre-pubertal (i.e. Tanner Stage 1). In 
contrast, among 49 males, 30 (61%) had testes and scrotum Stage 5 (adult genitalia) and 30 (61%) 
had pubic hair Stage 5 (adult type and quantity). Among 101 females, 48 (48%) had breast development 
Stage 5 (mature) and 45 (45%) had pubic hair Stage 5 (adult type and quantity). The number of patients 
evaluated  for  Tanner  Stage  at  Weeks 48  and  96  declined  substantially  from  screening  hampering 
evaluation of potential changes in any of the Tanner Stage measurements over time. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs that led to study treatment discontinuation by SOC and PT (Table 30). 
Narratives were provided for TEAEs that led to study treatment discontinuation. 
Overall, 9% of patients had a TEAE that led to study treatment discontinuation: Avonex 11%; Tecfidera 
6%. The TEAEs by PT that led to study treatment discontinuation (and subsequently also to withdrawal 
from study) in > 1% of patients in either treatment group were MS relapse and flushing. Of these, MS

relapse was reported in a similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups (Avonex 4%; Tecfidera 
3%), and flushing was only reported in patients in the Tecfidera group (3%).

Post marketing experience 
The Health Care Professional (HCP)-confirmed AEs and SAEs reported in the paediatric population are 
consistent with the experience in the total population in the postmarketing setting. As of 26 March 2021, 
a total of 4320 events (1099 confirmed by HCPs and 3221 reported by consumers) in paediatric patients 
reported in 1761 cases have been received since Tecfidera was first approved in the United States in 
March  2013.  The  majority  of  the  events  reported  in  paediatric  cases  were  nonserious  in  nature 
(4057/4320  events).  The  most  commonly  reported  events  were  product  administered  to  patient  of 
inappropriate age, off label use, flushing, MS relapse, nausea, and upper abdominal pain, and the most 
commonly  reported  serious  event  was  MS  relapse.  This  is  consistent  with  the  overall  Tecfidera 
population. 
3.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of DMF in paediatric patients has been characterised based on the reporting of TEAEs, 
SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation from treatment/ study, and TEAEs resulting in dose interruption 
or  dose  reduction  during  study  109MS306  Part 1.  Open-label  data  from  this  part  of  the  study  are 
available up  to  96 weeks.  Longer-term  safety  data  is  expected  from  the  ongoing  Part 2  of  the  study, 
which aims to add an additional 5 years of treatment with DMF, with results presented in a separate CSR 
after completion (expected in 2025, with next interim results in Q3/4 of 2022).  
The  paediatric  population  included  in  the  study  was  similar  to  those  in  other  DMTs  MS  studies  (i.e. 
Gilenya  EMEA/H/C/002202/X/0044/G  and  Aubagio  EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G).  However,  a  rather 
low number of paediatric patients (150 patients in total) was randomised, 78 patients in the DMF group 
and 72 patients in the Avonex group, which needs to be judged in the context of ongoing paediatric MS 
trials that are competing for patients. Mean (SD) age was 14.9 (1.62) years. The vast majority of patients 
belonged to the age group 15 to 17 years (69% in total). Few data are available regarding the age group 
13 to 14 years (32 of 150 patients, 21%; 18 patients on Tecfidera and 14 patients on Avonex). The most 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 75/152 
 
 
 
 
vulnerable  subpopulation  (paediatric  patients  <13 years  and  those  with  Tanner  stage 1)  is  even  less 
represented in study 109MS306, for which interpretability of safety data is severely limited: 
- 3 of 150 patients (2%) were pre-pubertal, i.e. they were Tanner stage 1 at screening, i.e. had 
a Tanner staging of “1” in each of the two gender-specific Tanner subscales (including a single 
patient on Tecfidera and two patients on Avonex, all of them male). From this limited set of data, 
a conclusion on clinical safety in pre-pubertal patients is impossible. 
- 15 of 150 patients (10%) were 10 to less than 13 years (7 on Tecfidera and 8 on Avonex); 
therefore, it is difficult to conclude on the safety profile in this age range.  
The  recommended DMF  dose  in  paediatric  patients is  expected  to  be  the  same  as  in  adults  based  on 
similar  exposure:  an  initial  dose  of  120 mg  BID  over  the  first  7 days  is  followed  by  240 mg  BID  as 
maintenance  dose.  Based  on  PK  results  from  the open-label,  multicentre,  multidose  study  109MS202 
(EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042), the rate and extent of exposure in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of 
age was comparable to adult subjects. For paediatric patients <13 years of age, no PK data are available; 
therefore, it remains unknown whether the adult dose administered could lead to an increase in exposure 
to MMF and subsequently to an increased risk for adverse events. Available PK data in the paediatric 
population relate to adolescents only (median age of adolescents in study 109MS202 was 16 years) and 
cannot be extrapolated to very young children, for whom clinical data in study 109MS306 are also very 
limited.  The  limitation/  lack  of  data  in  the  most  vulnerable  population,  together  with  the  uncertainty 
regarding bone effects in pre-pubertal/ very young paediatric patients (see further below), constituted 
a  major  concern  regarding  the  age  defined  in  the  indication  (…aged  10 years  and  older…).  As  a 
consequence,  the  Applicant  agreed  to  restrict  the  indication  to  paediatric  patients  aged  13 years  and 
older. 
Extent of exposure 
Mean  duration  of  treatment  during  study  Part 1  was  shorter  for  Avonex  as  compared  to  Tecfidera 
(72.3 weeks vs.84.4 weeks). The imbalance is driven by a higher number of patients who discontinued 
study drug in the Avonex group as compared to the Tecfidera group (42% vs. 22%).  
The  majority  of  patients  either  treated  with  Tecfidera  or  Avonex  were  on  study  drug  for  >88  to 
≤96 weeks (Tecfidera: 65% and Avonex: 58%). 12% of patients in the Tecfidera group had study drug 
treatment  of  >96 weeks  to  ≤104 weeks.  Cumulative  duration  of  study  treatment  for  Avonex  and 
Tecfidera was 100.18 subject-years and 126.69 subjects-years, respectively. 
For the revised age range (paediatric patients 13 to 18 years of age), the cumulative exposure for time 
on treatment for Avonex and Tecfidera is 89.49 subject-years vs. 113.81 subjects-years. 
TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
No death was reported. A similar number of patients in both groups reported a TEAE, i.e. 96% on Avonex 
and  95%  on  Tecfidera,  mainly  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  A  rather  high  proportion  of  paediatric 
patients reported SAEs in this study, which was higher in the Avonex group as compared to Tecfidera 
(29%  vs.  23%).  TEAE-related  discontinuations  from  treatment/  from  study  were  more  frequently 
reported in the Avonex group as compared to Tecfidera (6% and 11%).  
Common  AEs  associated  with  DMF  treatment  in  adults  are  GI  disorders  (including  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
abdominal  pain  upper,  abdominal  pain  and  vomiting),  flushing,  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders 
(pruritus,  rash,  erythema),  haematological  abnormalities  (lymphopenia  and  leukopenia),  increased 
hepatic enzymes, and proteinuria (reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002601/0000/Rev 1). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  during  study  109MS306  (Tecfidera  and  Avonex  group;  >20%  in 
either group) in paediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults and derived from the nervous

system disorders SOC, infections and infestations SOC, gastrointestinal disorders SOC, general disorders 
and administration site conditions SOC, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC, vascular 
disorders SOC, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC, and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders SOC. Differences mainly pertain to a disproportional reporting for MS relapse (35% vs. 46%), 
seasonal  infections  (nasopharyngitis  23%  vs.  13%;  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  12%  vs.  4%; 
influenza 10% vs. 4%), and gastroenteritis (12% vs. 7%), any TEAEs from the GI disorders SOC (mainly 
abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which occurred in 19 to 41% of patients on Tecfidera and in 6 
to 8% of patients on Avonex), flushing (38% vs. 1%), and rash/ erythema/ pruritus in 0 to 1% and 8 to 
14% of patients from either group. Overall, the most common TEAEs with Tecfidera in 109MS306 were 
abdominal pain (41%), flushing (38%), MS relapse (35%), headache (28%),  nasopharyngitis (23%), 
and vomiting (23%). 
MS relapse was reported more frequently in patients on Avonex as compared to Tecfidera, in line with 
the reporting of SAEs (more frequently in the Avonex group as compared to Tecfidera, 25% vs. 17%).  
Gastrointestinal disorder TEAEs are among the most frequently reported side effects of DMF-containing 
drug  products,  with incidences  in  adults  between  33%  (in  study 109MS303)  and  48%  (in  Pool  A)  for 
DMF 240 mg BID. An increased incidence of GI disorders in the Tecfidera group versus the Avonex group 
is  thus  expected  (74%  vs.  31%).  However,  in  paediatric  patients,  the  frequency  is  much  higher  as 
compared  to  adults,  mainly  driven  by  TEAEs  of  abdominal  pain  and  vomiting.  Gastroenteritis  (in  the 
infections  and  infestations  SOC),  was  higher  on  Tecfidera  as  compared  to  Avonex,  and  higher  as 
compared  to  adults.  A  single  SAE  of  GI  disorders  (abdominal  pain  upper)  was  reported  in  study 
109MS306,  and  no  patient  discontinued  due  to  a  GI  event,  while  14%  of  patients  had  treatment 
interruption  and/  or  dose  reduction.  Specifically  in  the  paediatric  population,  compliance  problems  or 
early  treatment  discontinuations  could  pose  an  issue;  however,  neither  for  this  study  nor  for  study 
109MS202  (n=22 patients)  and  its  extension  109MS311  (n=20 patients)  treatment  discontinuations 
were reported despite the high frequency of GI disorder TEAEs.  
TEAEs that occurred more frequently in the Tecfidera as compared to the Avonex group and, at the same 
time, more frequently in paediatric as compared to adult patients are, e.g. TEAEs from the GI disorders 
SOC, the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC, and dysmenorrhoea. The latter is unlikely 
related  to  sexual  dysfunction  and  might  be  expected  in  an  adolescent  and  mainly  female  population 
around menarche. Moreover, the concomitant use of analgesics in the Avonex treatment group (due to 
flu-like symptoms) could have abated dysmenorrhoea reporting in this group.  
Flushing and related symptoms, GI tolerability, infections (including potential opportunistic infections), 
ischemic  cardiovascular  disorders,  hepatic  disorders,  renal  disorders,  malignancies,  and  lymphopenia 
and leukopenia have been defined adverse events of special interest, and were qualitatively found in line 
with the known safety characteristics of Tecfidera in adults:  
Malignancies are a designated important potential risk of DMF treatment. In 109MS306, no malignancies 
were  reported.  Flushing  and  flushing-related  events  were  neither  rated  severe  or  serious  but  led  to 
treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (3%) and to dose interruption/ dose reduction in 5% of patients. 
No new concerns on cardiac safety could be deduced from DMF treatment in paediatric patients and did 
not emerge during treatment in adults. However, patients with significant cardiovascular conditions were 
excluded from participation in clinical trials. 
Serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) constitute an important potential 
risk in the RMP of DMF and seems to be similar for paediatric and adult patients. Infections were reported 
as  SAEs  (pneumonia  pneumococcal  and  tonsillitis)  and  4  infections  in  the  Tecfidera  group  (5%  of 
patients; i.e. gastroenteritis, influenza, and tonsillitis) led to dose interruption/ dose reduction. Overall, 
the long-term risk to acquire serious and/ or opportunistic infections in the paediatric population cannot 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 77/152 
 
 
 
be assessed based on the limited amount of long-term data. AESI in line with renal and hepatic disorders 
were neither rated severe, nor serious, nor led to discontinuation from treatment or interruption/ dose 
reduction  in  the  Tecfidera  group.  A  signal  of  renal toxicity  derived  from  nonclinical  studies  with  DMF. 
However, DMF in adults was not associated with an increased risk of renal or urinary events, neither in 
pivotal  studies  nor  in  the  long-term  extension  study  109MS303.  Proteinuria,  haematuria,  and 
microalbuminuria  were  each  reported  in  <  10%  of  adult  patients,  mild  to  moderate  in  severity,  and 
rarely  led  to  treatment  discontinuations.  Fewer  renal  (and  urinary)  disorders  TEAEs  were  reported  in 
paediatric  patients  on  Tecfidera  as  compared  to  Avonex  (10%  vs.  5%).  One  patient  in  each  group 
experienced  an  AESI  of  hepatocellular  injury.  DILI  is  an  identified  risk  for  DMF.  Monitoring  of  liver 
enzymes  is  recommended  in  the  product  information.  Moreover,  transient  mean  increases  in  liver 
transaminases with DMF typically develop within the first 4 weeks of treatment. There was no case of 
hepatitis or Hy’s law in paediatric patients. 
A reduction in lymphocyte counts, including the occurrence of lymphopenia, is an important identified 
risk with Tecfidera. Decreases in lymphocyte (and leukocyte) counts starting at Week 4 through Week 48 
with a plateau up to Week 96 were noted in adults. Mean decreases in paediatric patients were slightly 
lower as compared to adults, i.e. ~21% and 9% (adults: 30% and 11%) for lymphocyte and leukocyte 
counts, respectively. Overall, 20 of 78 patients treated with Tecfidera (25.6%) were reported with ALC 
<  0.91  ×  109/L  at  any  postbaseline  visit,  with  7 patients  having  an  ALC  <LLN  at  Week 96.  PCS 
lymphocyte  counts  <0.8  ×  109/L  and  <0.5  ×  109/L  were  reported  in  19%  and  4%  of  patients  in  the 
Tecfidera group. Severe prolonged lymphopenia defined as ALC < 0.5 × 10
9
/L for >6 months was not 
reported. However, 4 patients had prolonged, mild-to-moderate lymphopenia (5.1%), and two patients 
(2.6%) had prolonged moderate-to-severe lymphopenia. During the DMF MAA, analyses were performed 
and  showed  evidence  for  slight  recovery  of  lymphocytes  4 weeks  post  dose  (after  treatment 
discontinuation or completion). Nevertheless, these data were considered inconclusive, given that the 
observation period was short. Long-term study 109MS303 aimed to further address lymphocyte recovery 
with Tecfidera and results in adults were evaluated in EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0069/G. Time to recovery 
of lymphocyte counts has not been assessed given that patients with ALC counts <LLN at the end of 
treatment  switched to the  open-label  extension  (Part 2).  Lymphopenia  (lymphocyte  count  decreased) 
was reported in 3% (1%) of patients in the Tecfidera group, and rated as severe and serious in a single 
patient. This patient at the same time reported a SAE of tonsillitis. Both events led to hospitalisation and 
resolved  upon  interruption  of  treatment.  Lymphopenia  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  from  Tecfidera 
treatment. 
Serious AEs occurred in 39 patients, in 21 patients on Avonex and in 18 patients on Tecfidera. 3 of the 
39 patients (two on Tecfidera [SAE of fall/ fracture and MS relapse] and one in the Avonex group [SAE 
of  optic  neuritis])  were  <13 years.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAE  in both groups was  MS  relapse 
(17% of patients on Tecfidera vs. 25% on Avonex), which always led to hospitalisation and which was 
not rated related to study drug. In four patients on Tecfidera, MS relapse was reported as a SAE more 
than once during treatment (up to five SAEs of MS relapse were reported in patient 172-001), which 
could  indicate  a  high  disease  activity.  All  other  SAEs  in  either  group  were  reported  in  single  patients 
only. In the Tecfidera group these included epilepsy and generalised tonic-clonic seizure (one patient 
each), optic neuritis, presyncope, lymphopenia (related), pneumonia pneumococcal, tonsillitis (related), 
abdominal pain upper (related), fall/forearm fracture, suicide attempt and rash pruritic (related).  
TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  occurred  in  6%  of  patients  on  Tecfidera  and  in  11%  of 
patients on Avonex in line with the expected safety profile (i.e. MS relapse, flushing, and limb discomfort 
on Tecfidera). Temporary interruption of treatment and dose reduction were reported by more patients 
in the Tecfidera as compared to Avonex group (26% vs. 7%) and in line with known safety issues (most 
frequently due to GI disorders, flushing, gastroenteritis and pyrexia).

Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Haematology  results  are  basically  in  line  with  results  from  the  phase 3  adult  studies  (see  above). 
Eosinophil mean values transiently increased through Week 4 but returned to normal values by Week 12 
in adults and this was found similar in paediatric patients. 
In adult DMF clinical studies, hepatic transaminases ALT and AST increased compared to placebo, with 
a  peak  at  Week 4,  and  returned  to  baseline  values  around  Week 32.  ALT  and  AST  maximum  post-
baseline values were in a majority (>90%) of patients < 3x ULN and few patients had values ≥ 3x ULN 
in  either  treatment  group.  Hy`s  law  cases  were  not  reported.  Any  shifts  from  baseline  to  abnormal 
postbaseline  in  hepatic  enzymes  in  paediatric  patients  were  similar or  lower than  in  adults.  In  9%  of 
patients on Tecfidera, ALT increased was reported as TEAE and in 1%, a TEAE of blood bilirubin increased 
was  reported.  Hepatic  enzyme  increases  are  included  as  ADR  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  (frequency 
common). 
No new safety concerns derive from administration of Tecfidera in paediatric patients regarding blood 
chemistry and urinalysis data.  
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  in  vital  signs  or  ECG  parameters.  Any  potentially  clinically 
significant values observed in paediatric patients were in line with the experience in adults. 
Recent scientific data and preclinical experience with DRF (in the ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/005437) 
suggest that Nrf2 (which is activated by DMF and DRF via their common major active metabolite MMF) 
could play a direct role in the regulation of bone homeostasis stressing the importance of balanced Nrf2 
activation for normal bone development. Reference is made to 3.2.4. of this report. While the possible 
effect of DMF and DRF on bone homeostasis appears negligible for adult RRMS patients, the relevance 
and implications are more obvious in pre-pubertal children or those being in an early stage of puberty 
for whom the risk remains unknown. 
In the paediatric population special attention should be paid to possible adverse effects on growth (e.g. 
height and weight), sexual maturation, cognition, and endocrine function in line with the provisions of 
the  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.  2).  This  is  of  importance  given  that  susceptibility  to  specific  adverse 
reactions might change from pre- to post-pubertal status.  
The  MAH  presented  an  integrated  discussion  on  preclinical  and  clinical  data  with  regard  to  paediatric 
growth and development in study 109MS306, which focused on height progression (versus standardised 
WHO height-for-age charts for male and female children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years), bone age 
(versus chronological age), endocrine assessments, and sexual maturity as per Tanner staging. 
The results need to be interpreted in the context of the age distribution in this study, i.e. 69% and 21% 
of  the  overall  patients  belonged  to  the  age  group  15  to  17 years  and  13  to  14 years,  respectively. 
Moreover,  at  baseline,  a  majority  of  these  patients  were  already  in  an  advanced  stage  of  puberty 
indicated by a baseline Tanner stage 4 (approx. more than 75% in both groups). Therefore, the majority 
of patients in study 109MS306 might not have been affected by a potential impact of Tecfidera on growth 
and development. 
With regard to bone homeostasis, the paucity of clinical data did not unveil a negative effect of Tecfidera. 
Presentation of progression in height from baseline in male and female paediatric patients per age groups 
(i.e. 10 to 12 years, 13 to 14 years, and 15 to 17 years) revealed no signs of delay in those treated with 
Tecfidera as compared to Avonex and as compared to healthy controls over a 96-week treatment course 
in  this  study.  Few  patients  overall  had  bone  age  assessments  by  hand  and  wrist  radiography  (26  of 
72 patients on Avonex and 34 of 78 patients on Tecfidera). Nevertheless, bone age and chronological 
age  did  not  differ  by  more  than  2 SD,  the  cut-off  which  would  indicate  abnormalities  in  bone

development. To follow-up the impact of Tecfidera on bone homeostasis, “Impaired bone development 
in paediatric patients” has been confirmed to be added to the summary of safety concerns in the Periodic 
Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to ensure regular specific review of the topic. 
Only 14 patients on Tecfidera had endocrinological tests performed at baseline and even less at Week 48, 
and  Week 96,  respectively,  based  on  the  protocol  provisions.  Most  of  the  estradiol  and  testosterone 
levels  were  only  measured  once  during  the  study  hampering  determination  of  the  hormonal  state  in 
these subjects over time and a potential influence of Tecfidera. However, abnormalities in these or other 
endocrine parameters (LH, FSH, IGF-1) were not found remarkably different between treatment groups.  
Tanner  staging  was  assessed  at  screening  (and  Week 48  and  EOT  Part 1)  for  all  patients  (for 
premenarche female patients, until bone age reached ≥ 16 years or until postmenarche), based on pubic 
hair and breast development in girls, and presentation of testes and scrotum and pubic hair in boys. This 
concerned assessment in 42 female and in 25 male patients. Almost half of the female and a majority 
of male patients presented with Tanner stage 5 at screening. Given that only a single (male) patient on 
Tecfidera was pre-pubertal, the safety profile in this subset of paediatric patients cannot be assessed. 
Tanner stage in the age group 10 to <13 years progressed in both treatment groups over the course of 
the study, with Avonex-treated paediatric patients having had a slightly lower increase as compared to 
Tecfidera-treated patients, probably due to a lower baseline Tanner stage in the Avonex group. Tanner 
stage  progression  in  the  age  group  13  to  <15 years  was  more  even  in  both  treatment  groups  and  a 
similar trend for males and females treated with Tecfidera could be observed. In the age group 15 to 
18 years, there were three deviations from age-expected Tanner stage scoring at baseline, one in the 
Avonex group and two in the Tecfidera group. The influence of Avonex or Tecfidera on sexual maturation 
in  two  of  three  patients  remains  unknown.  Overall,  no  evidence  for  disruption  of  normal  sexual 
maturation as a consequence of Tecfidera treatment can be derived from these data. 
Overall, the MAH’s proposal to restrict the indication to paediatric patients aged 13 years and older is 
considered adequate to handle the limitation and even absence of clinical data in those patients being in 
an early stage of puberty, where any impact of DMF could be more relevant.  
Postmarketing  data  from  international  birth  date  of Tecfidera  in  the  US  to  data  cut-off  (i.e.  26 March 
2021; ~7 years) comprise off-label use data in paediatric patients. Cases for which AEs were reported 
were in a majority related to the known safety profile of Tecfidera and to the underlying disease. The 
most frequently mentioned SAE in paediatric patients in the postmarketing experience was MS relapse. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The following safety data were also submitted and discussed by the MAH as part of the documentation 
for this variation procedure and are hence considered supportive (reference is also made to 3.3.2. of 
this AR): 
Study 109MS202 
Reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0042 for detailed assessment of clinical safety. 
Safety  data  for  open-label  treatment  with  Tecfidera  for  24 weeks  are  available  for  22 paediatric  MS 
patients with a median age of 16 years and a body weight similar to adult subjects. Hence, this population 
is more representative of adults than of younger paediatric patients. Tolerability and safety issues (e.g. 
flushing  and  GI  effects)  were  found  in  line  with  the  known  effects  in  adults.  No  new  safety  concerns 
emerged  upon  this  limited  dataset  of  paediatric  patients having had  a  short  duration of  treatment.  A 
high reporting of TEAEs from the nervous system disorders SOC (59%; mainly due to MS relapse in one-
third  of  the  patients,  i.e.  32%)  is  of  note,  which  complies  with  the  data  from  109MS306.  SAEs  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 80/152 
 
 
 
reported in 5 patients (23%), with MS relapse reported in 4 of the 5 patients with SAEs. Dysmenorrhoea 
was reported in 2 patients (9%). 
Study 109MS311 
Reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0059 for detailed assessment of clinical safety. 
Safety  data  for  the  paediatric  population  from  study  109MS202  comprise  the extension  of  open-label 
treatment with Tecfidera for 96 weeks in 20 rollovers (median age of 17 years during the extension). 
Safety was generally in line with previous data (regarding GI disorders and flushing). MS relapse was 
reported in 20% of the patients. Dysmenorrhoea was reported in 3 patients (15%). 3 of 4 SAEs were 
MS relapse. 
3.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In support of the extension of the indication of Tecfidera to paediatric patients now revised to those aged 
13 years and older, the Applicant has provided open-label, active-controlled safety data up to 96 weeks 
deriving from Part 1 of phase 3 study 109MS306. Long-term safety data for up to 5 years of open-label 
treatment with Tecfidera (Part 2) have been separated from the Tecfidera PIP and are not yet available 
to  conclude  on  any  potential  impact  of  Tecfidera  treatment  during  longer  treatment  duration.  This  is 
adequately reflected in the product information (section 4.4).  
Available safety data for Tecfidera confirm the safety profile in paediatric patients to be qualitatively in 
line with that in the adult MS population. However, discrepancies have been noted in the incidence of 
events between paediatric and adult patients, i.e. a number of adverse events occurred with a higher 
frequency in paediatric patients as compared to adults. This has been dealt with by adequate labelling 
in  the  product  information  (section  4.8  of  the  SmPC).  Moreover,  recent  scientific  publications  and 
preclinical data of DRF submitted in the ongoing MA procedure EMEA/H/C/005437 support a concern of 
a potential impact of DMF on bone homeostasis, which could be of relevance in the very young and pre-
pubertal population for which pharmacological and clinical data are either lacking or very limited: Only 
7 patients treated with Tecfidera were <13 years of age, and only a single patient treated with Tecfidera 
was pre-pubertal (Tanner stage 1). Restriction of the indication to paediatric patients aged 13 years and 
older is therefore adequate to reduce a potential but not clinically substantiated risk. 
Approval of the revised indication is acceptable from a clinical safety perspective. Moreover, the product 
information has been revised as requested. 
3.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
3.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

3.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
3.7.1.  User consultation 
No  justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
4.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
4.1.  Therapeutic Context 
4.1.1.  Disease or condition 
With the present application, the Applicant originally sought approval of DMF for paediatric patients from 
10 years to 17 years of age with RRMS. As a consequence of the concerns raised during the first round 
of this procedure based on the limited data in paediatric patients aged 10 to 12 years and those being 
pre-pubertal at study entry, the Applicant proposes to limit the indication for the paediatric population 
to patients aged 13 years and older. 
Paediatric  MS  is  a  severe  chronic,  immune-mediated  neurodegenerative  disorder  of  the  CNS, 
characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal destruction, with marked impact on 
patients’  life  and  development,  and  leading  to  disability  early  in  life.  Although  MS  is  predominantly  a 
disease  of  young  adults,  approximately  3%  to  5%  of  people  with  MS  have  their  first  symptoms  in 
childhood. Genetic, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and cell-based studies largely support a shared biology 
between  paediatric-onset  and  adult-onset  disease.  Relapses  are  more  frequent  in  patients  with 
paediatric-onset compared with adult-onset MS and a greater number of MRI lesions is observed. One-

third of the paediatric MS patients experience cognitive impairment and MRI evidence of global and focal 
loss of age expected brain volume has been described. 
As  for  adult  MS  patients,  treatment  strategies  in  paediatric  MS  aim  at  the  symptomatic  treatment  of 
acute relapses and MS symptoms as well as on disease-modification.  
Due to the clinical phenotype of paediatric MS with relapses as the most important clinical component 
reflecting disease activity, the most important endpoints relate to relapses (clinical) and MRI findings 
(representing inflammation). 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Fingolimod  and  teriflunomide  are  the  only  DMT  as  of  yet  that  are  explicitly  approved  in  the  EU  for 
paediatric patients with RRMS aged 10 years and older. In addition, IFN β1a and GA can be used but 
efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the  paediatric  population  are  limited.  Corticosteroids  are  available  for  the 
symptomatic treatment of MS relapses. 
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In  support  of  the  extension  of  indication  in  the  paediatric  population,  study  109MS306  Part 1  (also 
referred to as study CONNECT) was presented. Study 109MS306 Part 1 is a 96 week (two-year), open-
label, multicenter, randomised, multiple-dose, active-controlled (against Avonex), parallel group trial to 
evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Tecfidera (also referred to as DMF; BG00012) (dosed: n = 
78)  vs.  Avonex  (dosed:  n  =  72)  administered  either  orally  BID  (Tecfidera)  or  intramuscularly  self-
administered once weekly (Avonex) in paediatric patients with RRMS followed by an optional open-label 
extension (Part 2) up to approximately 5 years. 
The  study  included  children  aged  10  to  <18  years  old  suffering  from  RRMS according  to  the  IPMSSG 
criteria for paediatric MS (2013 consensus definition for paediatric RRMS) [Krupp 2013] with an EDSS 
score ≤5.5. 
With regard to disease activity, the following criteria had to be met: 
- at least 1 relapse within the last 12 months prior to Day 1, with a prior brain MRI demonstrating 
lesions consistent with MS, or 
-  at  least  2  relapses  within  the  last  24  months  prior  to  Day  1,  with  a  prior  brain  MRI 
demonstrating lesions consistent with MS, or 
- evidence of Gd-enhancing lesions of the brain on an MRI performed within the 6 weeks prior 
to Day 1. 
Subjects could be MS-treatment naïve or could have received prior MS DMTs. 
4.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was the “proportion of patients with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense 
lesions  at  week  96  relative  to  baseline”,  performed  in  the  Completer  population.  The  proportion  of 
patients  with  no  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2 hyperintense  lesions  at  week  96 relative  to  baseline  was 
higher in the Tecfidera group (10 of 62 patients, 16.1% [95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI: 8.0%, 27.7%]) 
than in the Avonex group with 2 of 41 patients, 4.9% [95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI: 0.6%, 16.5%].  
Assessment report

Results have been confirmed in a “sensitivity analysis” that has been performed in the ITT population. 
The proportion of patients with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at week 96 relative 
to baseline was higher in the Tecfidera group with 10 of 78 patients (12.8%) than in the Avonex group 
(2  of  72  patients,  2.8%).  The  OR  for  the  proportion  of  patients  with  no  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense lesions at Week 96 in the Tecfidera group compared with the Avonex group was 6.99 (95% 
CI: 1.63, 49.88). 
With regard to the secondary endpoint, the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions 
on brain MRI scans at Week 96 performed in the ITT population excluding patients without MRI at that 
visit, the adjusted mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was 32.65 (95% CI: 
20.97,  50.85)  for  the  Avonex  group  and  12.42  (95%  CI:  8.79,  17.54)  for  the  Tecfidera  group, 
corresponding to a 61.96% reduction in the Tecfidera group compared to the Avonex group.  
Two  sensitivity  analyses  (a)  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  hyperintense  lesions  relative  to 
baseline,  Last  Observation  on/prior  to  the  week  96  visit,  b)  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2 
hyperintense  lesions  relative  to  baseline,  Last  Observation  on/prior  to  the  week  96  Visit,  prior  to  the 
alternative  medication  have  been  performed.  Both  analyses  showed  a  trend  in  favour  of  Tecfidera  as 
well, but the difference in favour of Tecfidera was smaller than in the completer analysis. 
At week 96, the proportion of patients free of new MRI activity (i.e., free of Gd-enhancing and free of 
new or newly enlarging T2 MRI lesions on brain MRI scans) relative to baseline was higher in the Tecfidera 
group  (9  of  62  patients,  14.5%)  than  in  the  Avonex  group  with  2  of  42  patients  (4.8%)  (OR  for 
proportions: 8.76 (95% CI: 1.51, 81.44). 
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  the  probability  for  clinical  relapse  was  34%  in  the  Tecfidera  group  and 
48% in the Avonex group during the 96-week open-label study period. The HR for relapse was 0.574 
(95% CI: 0.329 to 1.001). In comparison to Avonex the time to first relapse was delayed in the Tecfidera 
treatment arm.  
At Week 96, the adjusted ARR for the Avonex group was 0.528 (95% CI: 0.333, 0.836), and 0.240 (95% 
CI: 0.147, 0.393) for the Tecfidera group (rate ratio 0.46, 95% CI (0.26, 0.78). Most of the patients in 
both treatment arms experienced 0 relapses (Avonex 58%, Tecfidera 68%) up to week 96. 
Descriptively summarised results for the EDSS score: the mean (SD) EDSS score at baseline was 1.12 
(0.966) and 1.16 (1.074) for the Avonex and the Tecfidera treatment group, respectively, while at week 
96 the mean (SD) EDSS score was 1.19 (1.101) and 1.17 (1.217), respectively, representing almost no 
changes in EDSS score for both treatment groups.  
Exploratory endpoint: At all visits, most of the patients in both treatment groups had no Gd-enhancing 
lesions with a generally higher proportion in the Tecfidera group than in the Avonex group. At Week 96 
the mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 1.3 under Avonex compared to 1.4 under Tecfidera. The 
OR of being in the group with higher Gd lesions in the Tecfidera group versus Avonex group was 0.43 
(95%  CI:  0.18,  1.03),  reflecting  the  trend  that  patients  in  the  Tecfidera  group  tended  to  be  in  the 
categories  with  less  Gd  lesions  compared  to  Avonex.  From  baseline,  the  mean  number  of  T1  Gd-
enhancing lesions in the Avonex group declined from 3.58 to 1.3, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing 
lesions in the Tecfidera group declined from 2.35 to 1.4 at week 96.  
The efficacy outcomes of DMF in the paediatric population and young adults seem to be consistent with 
those from the overall adult patient population and in favour of Tecfidera in the provided analyses. In 
study  109MS306,  Tecfidera  indicates  an  effect  on  typical  MRI  based  parameters  for  assessing  the 
inflammatory component of MS. Therefore, it may be assumed, based on the known clinical efficacy in 
adult patients, that the clinical efficacy in children is also alike that observed in adults.

4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The proposed posology in the initially requested paediatric population aged 10 years and older is the 
same as in adults. PK bridging was performed based on already available and previously assessed PK 
data from a small paediatric phase 2, open-label, uncontrolled study in 21 paediatric patients aged 13 
to  17 years.  The  data  suggest  similar  exposure  with  the  same  dose  of  DMF  in  adolescent  and  adult 
patients. However, no PK data are available for patients < 13 years of age. It is unclear whether the 
adult  dose  is  appropriate  for  these  young  patients. Potential  overexposure  is  a  safety  rather  than  an 
efficacy issue. However, with the response to the RSI, the MAH proposed a restriction of the indication 
to adolescents ≥13 years of age, which is considered adequate to address this uncertainty.  
One  efficacy  study  has  been  provided  in  support  of  the  claimed  paediatric  indication.  Due  to 
methodological  limitations  (including  open-label  design,  no  type  1  error  control,  methods  not  pre-
specified in full detail, analyses generally not based on ITT-population), results are considered descriptive 
and do not provide  confirmatory evidence of efficacy for Tecfidera in the paediatric population.  
The study has been conducted in an open-label design. As  MRI scans were transferred electronically, 
read  and  interpreted  by  an  independent  blinded  assessment  centre,  bias  for  the  assessment  of  the 
primary endpoint can be excluded. In addition, in reference to the description of the study report and 
based on the Applicant´s responses to the RSI, it is considered that a potential bias from de-blinding 
the examining neurologist to the clinical endpoints, e.g. relapse confirmation, was also limited. As the 
outcome on clinical relapses and data for new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, both representing disease 
activity, were concordant in the two treatment arms, the measures taken to maintain the blind for the 
assessment  of  the  clinical  endpoints  are  expected  to  have  been  sufficient,  although  no  explicit 
information is given, whether e.g. injection sides had to be sufficiently covered, to maintain the blind as 
far as possible. Overall, also taking into consideration, that the ARR has been evaluated as a secondary 
endpoint in this open label study, the blinding could be considered acceptable. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent AEs after Tecfidera and Avonex administration were reported for 95% and 96% of 
paediatric patients in study 109MS306, respectively, with discontinuations due to TEAEs in 6% and 11% 
of patients and SAEs in 23% and 29% of patients (a majority of them being MS relapse). No death was 
reported. TEAEs with Tecfidera in study 109MS306 were qualitatively in line with those in adults. The 
SOCs with the highest proportions of subjects reporting TEAEs were nervous system disorders, infections 
and infestations, GI disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, vascular disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The most common TEAEs in the Tecfidera group included abdominal 
pain (41%), flushing (38%), MS relapse (35%), headache (28%), nasopharyngitis (23%), and vomiting 
(23%).  Quantitative  differences  in  the  reporting  of  TEAEs  in  paediatric  patients  in  excess  of  those  in 
adults  have  been  noted,  e.g.  for  MS  relapse,  headache,  GI  disorders  (mainly  abdominal  pain  and 
vomiting), events from the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC, and dysmenorrhoea.  
Serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) are a potential risk with DMF 
treatment.  In  study  109MS306,  two  serious  infections  were  reported  (pneumonia  pneumococcal  and 
tonsillitis). None resulted in discontinuation from treatment. 
Decreases  in  leukocyte  and  lymphocyte  counts  are  an  important  identified  risk  with  DMF,  starting  at 
Week 4  through  Week 48  with  a  plateau  up  to  Week 96.  Mean  decreases  from  baseline  in  paediatric 
patients were 9% and 21% for leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, respectively. In 109MS306, 7 patients 
in the Tecfidera group (i.e. approx. 9%) had at least one post-baseline lymphocyte count below LLN (< 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 90/152 
 
 
 
0.91 × 109/L). Three of them permanently discontinued treatment (for other reasons), and three had 
/L for more than 6 months 
dose interruption. Severe prolonged lymphopenia defined as ALC < 0.5 × 10
9
has not been reported due to protocol requirements for discontinuation. 3% and 1% of patients reported 
lymphopenia  and  lymphocyte  count  decreased  as  a  TEAE.  A  single  patient  reported  a  SAE  of 
lymphopenia. No patient discontinued treatment with Tecfidera due to lymphopenia. 
Malignancies and cases of PML were not reported in paediatric patients but are potential and identified 
risks with DMF treatment in the RMP. 
Increases in liver transaminases and related hepatic events have been reported in the adult DMF clinical 
programme and baseline and routine monitoring of  liver enzymes is detailed in the SmPC. DILI is an 
important  identified  risk  with  DMF  and  is  included  as  ADR  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  Transient 
asymptomatic  increases  in  liver  transaminases  with  DMF  were  reported  within  the  first  4 weeks  of 
treatment in adult and likewise in paediatric patients. In a majority of paediatric patients on Tecfidera 
or  Avonex,  increases  were  in  line  with  ALT  and/  or  AST  of  <  3x  ULN.  Laboratory  abnormalities  were 
reported as TEAE in a single patient each for ALT increased and blood bilirubin increased. One patient in 
each  group  experienced  an  AESI  of  hepatocellular  injury.  Cases  of  Hy’s  law  were  not  observed  in 
paediatric  patients.  The  safety  profile  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  is  an  area  of  missing 
information in the RMP. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  impaired  renal  function  with  Tecfidera  treatment  in  paediatric  patients. 
Abnormal urinalysis parameters were reported for urine protein, urine ketones and urine occult blood (in 
92%, 59%, and 44% of Tecfidera patients and in in 81%, 14%, and 40% of Avonex patients in study 
109MS306) without corresponding to renal TEAEs. Proteinuria was reported in 3% of paediatric patients. 
Proteinuria is included as common ADR with DRF and DMF in section 4.8 of the SmPC. DMF treatment of 
patients with moderate and/ or severe renal impairment is a missing information in the RMP. In addition, 
the interaction with nephrotoxic medications leading to renal toxicity is listed as an important potential 
risk in the Tecfidera RMP.  
Vascular disorders (incl. flushing and flushing-related TEAEs) were reported by 46% and 8% of paediatric 
patients  on  Tecfidera  and  Avonex,  respectively,  and  were  neither  rated  severe  or  serious  but  led  to 
treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (3%) and to dose interruption/ dose reduction in 5% of patients. 
Gastrointestinal disorders TEAEs (mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and abdominal pain) are among the most 
frequently reported side effects of DMF-containing drug products, with incidences between 33% (in study 
109MS303) and 48% (in Pool A) for DMF 240 mg BID and in line with data from the psoriasis indication 
(see EPAR of Skilarence EMEA/H/C/002157/0000). In 109MS306, 74% of patients on Tecfidera (31% on 
Avonex) reported GI disorders TEAEs, and in a single patient, abdominal pain upper was rated serious. 
No  event  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  14%  of  patients  on  Tecfidera  had  a  dose  reduction/ 
interruption due to GI events. Routine risk minimisation measures to improve GI tolerability with DMF 
include temporary dose reduction to half the maintenance dose and the intake with food. 
4.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of Tecfidera in paediatric patients is based on a limited dataset of 78 patients 
exposed  to  Tecfidera  and 72 patients  exposed  to  Avonex  in  study  109MS306.  Cumulative  duration of 
study  treatment  for  Avonex  and  Tecfidera  is  100.18 subject-years  vs.  126.69 subjects-years.  For  the 
updated  age  range  proposed  by  the  MAH  (paediatric  patients  13  to  18 years  of  age),  the  cumulative 
exposure for time on treatment for Avonex and Tecfidera is 89.49 subject-years vs. 113.81 subjects-
years, and for time on study it is 93.21 subject-years vs. 118.35 subjects-years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 91/152 
 
 
 
Long-term data are available for 96 weeks of treatment during Part 1; however, only 78% of patients in 
the Tecfidera group completed the treatment (and 58% of patients on Avonex). Further long-term data 
from the open-label extension (Part 2) will not be presented within this procedure. The MAH committed 
to present interim data after the next interim analysis, which is scheduled for Q3/4 of 2022.  
Few  safety  data  are  available  regarding  the  most  vulnerable  subpopulations  (i.e.  children  aged  10  to 
<13 years and pre-pubertal patients [Tanner stage 1]) for which interpretability of safety data is either 
difficult  or  impossible.  No  PK  data  is  available  for  these  paediatric  subpopulations  and  it  is  unknown 
whether the proposed (adult) DMF dose (i.e. 240 mg BID) leads to an increased exposure to MMF and 
subsequently to the risk for an increase in side effects: 
- Age: mean age was 14.9 (1.62) years. Only 7 patients on Tecfidera and 8 patients on Avonex 
(i.e. 15 out of 150 patients, 10%) were <13 years. 
-  Pubertal  status:  Only  3 patients  were  pre-pubertal  (2%,  reflected  by  Tanner  Stage 1  at 
screening) of which one patient was treated with Tecfidera. Therefore, no safety conclusion in 
pre-pubertal patients can be drawn.  
The  Applicant  proposed  a  restriction  of  the  indication  to  adolescents  ≥13 years  of  age,  which  is 
considered to adequately mitigate this uncertainty.  
Uncertainty  has  been  raised  on  a  potential  impact  of  Tecfidera  on  bone  homeostasis  in  paediatric 
patients, in which Nrf2, the proposed main target of DMF action, was found to play a direct role. The 
mechanistic  rationale  has  been  discussed  in  detail  in  the  ongoing  MA  procedure  of  DRF 
(EMEA/H/C/005437) and also applies to DMF, because both DMF and DRF exert their pharmacological 
activity via the common major active metabolite MMF. Detrimental effects on bone homeostasis, if any, 
are  likely  to  especially  affect  younger  patients  with a  growing  skeleton.  However,  available  data  (i.e. 
bone  age  evaluation  and  laboratory  parameters)  suggest  that  Tecfidera  does  not  pose  a  risk  for 
impairment.  In  addition,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  proposed  restriction  of  the  indication  to 
adolescents aged 13 years and older will reduce the most vulnerable population. Additionally, the MAH 
confirmed  that  “Impaired  bone  development  in  paediatric  patients”  will  be  added  to  the  summary  of 
safety concerns in the PSURs to ensure regular specific review of the topic. 
Uncertainty  has  also  been  raised  with  regard  to  potential  effects  on  growth  and  sexual  maturation. 
Growth  parameters  (e.g.  height  and  weight)  and  Tanner  staging  assessments  provide  valuable 
information on a possible drug effect on physical development in paediatric MS patients and are thus to 
be assessed according to EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2. Upon request, the Applicant presented an 
integrated  analysis  on  aspects  of  growth  and  development  in  paediatric  patients  treated  in  study 
109MS306,  including  assessment  of  physical  features  (i.e.  height),  bone  age  assessment,  endocrine 
laboratory  parameters  and  Tanner  staging.  It  should  be  noted  that  a  majority  of  paediatric  patients 
(more than 75% in both groups) enrolled in study 109MS306 had a baseline Tanner stage of 4, and were 
on  average  15 years  of  age,  thus  limiting  the  informative  value  for  the  less  physically  progressed 
paediatric patients. Paediatric patients stratified by age groups (10 to <13 years, 13 to <15 years, and 
15  to  <18 years)  similarly  progressed  in height  and  Tanner  stage  during 96 weeks  of  treatment  with 
either  Tecfidera  or  Avonex  and  as  expected  to  background  healthy  reference  populations.  Moreover, 
bone age largely corresponds to chronological age in study 109MS306; however, far less than half of the 
patients  in  either  group  had  measurements  of  bone  age.  The  number  of  patients  per age  group  with 
measurement of bone age is low as expected, especially in the lower age groups 10 to <13 years and 
13 to <15 years (less than 10 patients per treatment group and time point). The informative value of 
endocrine  tests  is  limited given  that  only  few  patients  had  serial  measures  of  laboratory  parameters. 
However, abnormalities in estradiol, testosterone or other endocrine parameters (LH, FSH, IGF-1) were 
not found remarkably different between treatment groups.  
Assessment report

In this context it has been noted that dysmenorrhoea occurred more frequently in adolescent patients 
treated  with  Tecfidera  as  compared  to  Avonex  and  in  excess  of  adult  females.  However,  there  is  no 
evidence that dysmenorrhoea is related to sexual dysfunction caused by Tecfidera. Possible reasons for 
the different reporting in the Tecfidera and Avonex group could be related to different baseline Tanner 
stages  (higher  proportion  of  Tanner  stage  4  in  the  Tecfidera  group)  and  the  more  frequent  use  of 
analgesics  in  the  Avonex  group  (due  to  flu-like  symptoms).  The  difference  in  reporting  between  this 
study  and  in  adults  could  be  age-related  given  that  dysmenorrhoea  more  frequently  affects  younger 
female patients as compared to older female patients. Adequate labelling is proposed in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
In  addition,  a  disproportionate  reporting  of  TEAEs  was  observed  in  paediatric  as  compared  to  adult 
patients (Pool A data of the Tecfidera clinical program in adults), including, for example, TEAEs from the 
GI disorders SOC and from the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC. Patient compliance 
and early treatment discontinuations in the real-world setting have been discussed for GI disorders but 
there is at present no indication that this poses an issue in the paediatric population given the absence 
of  treatment  discontinuations  due  to  GI-related  TEAEs.  The  MAH  added  a  description  of  TEAEs  that 
occurred with a difference of 10% or more in paediatric patients compared to adults in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Moreover, the long-term risk to acquire serious and/ or opportunistic infections in the paediatric 
population seems not different from that in the adult population with more data collected during Part 2 
of study 109MS306. At present, the language included in the PI is considered sufficient (recommending 
interruption of treatment with Tecfidera if a serious infection occurs). 
With regard to the uncertainty on lymphopenia, it could be clarified that – despite the absence of patients 
with  prolonged  severe  lymphopenia,  there  were  4  patients  with  prolonged,  mild-to-moderate 
lymphopenia  (5.1%),  and  two  patients  with  prolonged  moderate-to-severe  lymphopenia  (2.6%).  No 
patient  was  included  in  the  lymphocyte  recovery  monitoring  period  since  patients  with  ALC<LLN  at 
Week 96 either entered the open-label period or switched to another DMT. Despite limitations regarding 
the small data set, lymphopenia seems not worse in paediatric patients as compared to adults, rendering 
the current risk minimisation measures sufficient in paediatric patients.

4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  efficacy  of  DMF  in  the  treatment  of  RRMS  has  already  been  established  in  adult  patients.  The 
Applicant is now seeking extension of the indication to paediatric RRMS patients 13 years and above. 
In  the  paediatric  study  109MS306  Part 1,  DMF  exerted  the  expected  anti-inflammatory  effects,  as 
derived from MRI-based endpoints that appeared favourable compared to IFN β. The anti-inflammatory 
effects convey the benefit of DMF in the treatment of RRMS and eventually slow disease progression. 
Favourable effects with DMF were also observed regarding clinical relapses. 
As to be expected in the paediatric MS population with a generally rather low disability progression, no 
relevant changes in EDSS scores were seen from study start until the end of the 96 weeks period.  
Overall, in the light of the given methodological limitations (including open-label design, no type 1 error 
control, methods not pre-specified in full details, analyses generally not based on ITT-population), the 
results  from  study  109MS306  Part 1  are  considered  descriptive  and  do  not  provide  stand-alone 
confirmatory evidence of efficacy for Tecfidera in the paediatric RRMS population. However, in a situation 
where efficacy has already been established in adult RRMS patients, independent confirmation of efficacy 
in paediatric patients is not necessary.  
Based  on  further  post-hoc  analyses  including  previous  adult  RRMS  studies  with  DMF,  the  efficacy 
outcomes on the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, Gd-enhancing lesions and relapse rate 
of dimethyl fumarate in the paediatric population and in young adults (up to 25 years of age) appear to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 95/152 
 
 
 
be consistent with those from the overall studied adult patients and in favour of Tecfidera compared to 
IFN β or placebo. 
In addition, genetic, serum, cerebrospinal fluid and cell-based studies support a shared biology between 
paediatric-onset and adult-onset disease. Therefore, it can principally be assumed that a drug that has 
been proven to be effective in adult RRMS will likewise be effective in paediatric RRMS if an equivalent 
dose is administered. 
Taking these considerations and the totality of the evidence together, efficacy of DMF with the proposed 
dose can be considered established for paediatric RRMS patients 13 years and older. 
The safety profile of Tecfidera in paediatric patients is claimed to be similar to that in the adult RRMS 
population, for which adequate risk minimisation measures are in place. Safety in paediatric patients is 
based on a small dataset generated in a single open-label study against Avonex as active comparator. 
Owing to the rarity of childhood-onset RRMS, which resulted in recruitment problems, it is acknowledged 
that the age range of paediatric patients 10 to 17 years is not evenly distributed in the study (neither in 
the Tecfidera nor in the Avonex group). Moreover, supportive PK data in the lower age range 10 to less 
than 13 years are lacking and no such data have been generated in study 109MS306. Thus, the clinical 
study experience in children aged 10 to <13 years and in those being pre-pubertal (reflected by Tanner 
stage 1 at screening) and treated with Tecfidera is solely based on 7 and 1 patient(s), respectively, which 
does not allow to confirm that the safety profile in the very young children and in adolescents is similar, 
especially with regard to an effect on bone development for which pre-pubertal children are obviously 
more vulnerable than adolescents at more advanced age. This is further corroborated by the fact that it 
remains uncertain whether the same dose of DMF (i.e. 240 mg BID) applied to all paediatric patients 
independent of weight produces similar exposure to MMF. The Applicant thus accepted to restrict the 
indication to adolescents 13 years of age and older, which is acceptable from a clinical safety perspective. 
The pattern of AEs with Tecfidera in paediatric patients observed in study 109MS306 is largely in line 
with that in the adult population reported in clinical studies and postmarketing.  
However, comparison of clinical safety in paediatric and adult patients (from pivotal adult studies forming 
Pool A in the original Tecfidera submission) revealed an overall higher incidence in TEAEs at least from 
the nervous system disorders (driven by MS relapse), GI disorders, TEAES from the respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders, and dysmenorrhoea, which are also more frequently reported in paediatric 
patients treated with Tecfidera compared to Avonex. Adequate labelling is proposed to be added to the 
product information. So far, no differences have been noted between paediatric and adult patients with 
regard to haematological changes, e.g. for lymphopenia. However, the consequences that derive from 
severe and/ or prolonged lymphopenia (i.e. serious and/ or opportunistic infections and PML) would not 
have been detected within this study due to its short duration and limited number of patients included.  
The lack of long-term safety data beyond 96 weeks of treatment in paediatric patients is an uncertainty. 
However, the indication now precludes treatment in the most vulnerable paediatric population, i.e. in 
those  aged  <13 years  and  those  being  pre-pubertal,  and  data  from  the  currently  ongoing  open-label 
extension Part 2 will shed more light on the long-term safety of DMF in adolescent patients. Physical and 
sexual  development  within  96 weeks  of  treatment  has  been  analysed  and  addressed.  Based  on  the 
limited data set, there is no evidence for a negative impact of Tecfidera on bone homeostasis, progression 
in growth, endocrine parameters, and sexual maturity by Tanner staging.  
4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of Tecfidera has already been demonstrated in adult patients with RRMS. Similar efficacy can be 
concluded in the proposed paediatric patient population based on shared disease biology, similar drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 96/152 
 
 
 
exposure (derived from PK studies), and similar anti-inflammatory effects. Re-establishing efficacy on 
its own is not necessary. Results for all relevant endpoints reflecting disease activity are indicative for 
an  effect  of  dimethyl  fumarate  in  the  studied  patient  population  comparable  to  that  seen  in  adults, 
assuming that the clinical efficacy in children is also alike that observed in adults.  
The MAH accepted to restrict the indication to paediatric patients 13 years of age and above; therefore, 
concerns  on  whether  the  adult  dose  is  appropriate  for  patients  <13 years  (for  whom  no  PK  data  are 
available) are no longer pursued and no additional data could be presented.  
The safety profile of Tecfidera in the paediatric RRMS population generally presents with findings similar 
to  adults,  for  whom  the  drug  was  approved  in  the  European  Union  7 years  ago  and  for  which  risk 
minimisation measures proved efficacious. The incidence of some TEAEs with Tecfidera appears to be 
increased  over  Avonex  and  over  those  in  adults  but  adequate  labelling  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  is 
proposed. At present, a potentially negative impact of DMF on bone homeostasis based on mechanistic 
considerations  and  preclinical  findings  with  DMF  and  DRF  could  not  be  substantiated  from  a  clinical 
perspective based on the limited data set in study 109MS306.  
Likewise, a thorough discussion on physical and sexual development in study 109MS306 was provided. 
Based on the limited dataset and available clinical assessments, no safety concern could be identified.

The  overall  B/R  of  Tecfidera  in  the  extension  of  the  updated  indication  applied  for,  i.e.  “treatment  of

positive. 
5.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS)  in  paediatrics  patients  from  13  years  of  age  and  over;  as  a 
consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The risk management plan (RMP) is updated to version 13 based on Study 109MS306 data supporting 
the request for a paediatric indication. The marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to update 
Assessment report

Page 97/152 
 
 
 
 
the RMP with the most updated data (Part II modules SIV, SV and SVII).  
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing protection of one additional year in accordance with 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0177/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet 
Additional marketing protection 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) 
of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  and  the  “Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant 
clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit 
from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period”,17 and  considers  that  the  new  therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1). 
However, by its Judgment of 5 May 2021 in Case T-611/18, Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma v EMA,18 
the  General  Court  held  that  Tecfidera  does  not  benefit  from  an  independent  global  marketing 
authorisation.  EMA  has  lodged  an  appeal  against  the  General  Court’s  ruling,  and  the  appellate 
proceedings are pending. Nevertheless, for the purpose of implementing the General Court’s ruling, but 
without  prejudice  to  its  position  in  the  appellate  proceedings,  the  Agency  has  conducted  an  ad  hoc 
assessment relating to the therapeutic effect of monoethyl fumarate salts (MEF) within Fumaderm (in 
this respect, see the Opinion adopted by the CHMP on 11 November 202119 and appended as an Annex 
to the CHMP assessment report on the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies 
in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ).  
In light of the scientific conclusions outlined in its Opinion of 11 November 2021, the CHMP is of the view 
that the totality of the available data cannot establish that MEF exerts a clinically relevant therapeutic 
contribution within Fumaderm. Those scientific conclusions and the Judgment of the General Court of 5 
May  2021  in  Case  T-611/18  support  the  determination  that  Tecfidera  does  not  benefit  from  an 
independent  global  marketing  authorisation.  This  also  entails  that,  following  the  General  Court’s 
reasoning, Tecfidera could not benefit, at the time of the submission of this type II variation application, 
from any marketing protection. As a result and without prejudice to the outcome of the above referenced 
appellate proceedings, the granting of an additional one-year of marketing protection period for Tecfidera 
cannot be recommended at this time.

6.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 27 January 2022 
Following the CHMP conclusion that, the granting of an additional one-year of marketing protection period 
for Tecfidera could not be recommended, the MAH submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of 
the grounds for refusal.  
In that context, Biogen confirmed that the scope of its request for re-examination is limited to the section 
of the CHMP Opinion of 27 January 2022 insofar as it did not recommend the requested extension of 
marketing protection. In that regard, Biogen expressly noted that the request for re-examination is also 
directed against the CHMP Opinion of 11 November 2021. 
As an initial remark, it is important to recall that the CHMP is a scientific body. As explained by Recital 
23 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the CHMP has been vested with exclusive responsibility for preparing 
EMA’s  opinions  on  all  questions  concerning  medicinal  products  for  human  use.  It  follows  from  the 
provisions of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the CHMP is competent to provide scientific opinions and 
recommendations.   
Turning to the grounds for re-examination submitted by Biogen, the MAH submitted the following three 
grounds:  (i)  “Grounds  in  relation  to  the  Ad  Hoc  Opinion  and  the  appended  ad  hoc  assessment”  (ii) 
“Grounds in relation to the implications of the Variation Opinion”; and (iii) “Grounds in relation to the 
implications of the Ad Hoc Opinion in respect of whether the authorisation of Fumaderm was capable as 
commencing a GMA for Tecfidera”.  
Based on a review of the above-mentioned grounds, it was noted that the scientific claims put forward 
by the marketing authorisation holder are contained under the section titled, “Grounds in relation to the 
Ad  Hoc  Opinion  and  the  appended  ad  hoc  assessment”.  Taking  into  account  the  legal  framework 
governing the evaluation of medicinal products (including, an application for a type II variation) and the 
scientific competence of the CHMP, the focus of the re-examination procedure concerned the scientific 
claims contained under this section.  
Further, it bears highlighting that certain claims and arguments relating to the “Grounds in relation to 
the  implications  of  the  Variation  Opinion”  and  “Grounds  in  relation  to  the  implications  of  the  Ad  Hoc 
Opinion in respect of whether the authorisation of Fumaderm was capable as commencing a GMA for 
Tecfidera” revolve around legal and regulatory considerations which do not need to be addressed by an 
EMA scientific committee, such as the CHMP. 
6.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the MAH 
The applicant presented in writing arguments refuting the grounds for refusal. The detailed grounds for 
re-examination are structured and summarised as follows: 
•  Grounds in relation to the Ad Hoc Opinion and the ad hoc assessment 
In this section Biogen has set out its concerns about the scientific evaluation of the contribution of MEF 
in Fumaderm in the ad hoc assessment report. Biogen’s primary conclusion is that the nonclinical data, 
together with the consistency of findings across the clinical studies with no significant methodological 
limitations and the consistency across clinical endpoints (which show clinically relevant improved efficacy 
for DMF/MEF as compared to DMF alone), constitutes good scientific evidence that MEF contributes to 
the  clinical  efficacy  of  the  DMF/MEF  combination  in  Fumaderm.  In  this  respect,  Biogen  relies  upon  a 
supporting expert report from a Professor. This Professor concludes that the available data from the two 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 99/152 
 
 
 
key studies [Mrowietz 201720; Nieboer 199021] do not suffer from material methodological limitations 
and  point  clearly  to  a  contribution  of  MEF.  Furthermore,  even  if  the  CHMP  disagrees  with  Biogen’s 
interpretation of the data, it cannot properly be asserted that the data constitute good scientific evidence 
of the absence of any therapeutic contribution of MEF in Fumaderm. As the CHMP is aware, “absence of 
evidence”  is  not  the  same  as  “evidence  of  absence”.  This  should  be  properly  reflected  in  the  Ad  Hoc 
Opinion because, this has implications for the conclusions that can be drawn from the Ad Hoc Opinion 
with regard to applications to market generic Tecfidera as well as Biogen’s type II variation application. 
Nor  does  the  CHMP  set  out  its  reasoning  for  not  recognising  this  difference,  including  its  reasons  for 
dismissing all the clinical studies as having material methodological limitations. Biogen does not believe 
that  the  final  conclusion  of  the  CHMP  is  correct;  furthermore,  the  absence  of  full  reasoning  for  the 
difference between the cautious conclusions on the individual studies and the unqualified nature of the 
final  conclusion  is  striking,  particularly  so  given  the  various  ways  in  which  the  Ad  Hoc  Opinion  and 
assessment are relevant to the integrity and consistent operation of the EU regulatory framework, and 
given the public health and other implications of their application. Biogen respectfully submits that even 
if the CHMP does not revise the Variation Opinion and the Ad Hoc Opinion to state (as Biogen contends 
that the CHMP should), that the available data demonstrate a clinically relevant therapeutic effect of MEF 
in Fumaderm, and that Tecfidera and Fumaderm therefore do not belong to the same GMA, the CHMP 
should at minimum revise the Variation Opinion and the Ad Hoc Opinion to state that the available data 
do not demonstrate that MEF does not have a clinically relevant therapeutic effect in Fumaderm, that 
the CHMP therefore cannot conclude that MEF does not have such an effect, and that Fumaderm and 
Tecfidera therefore do not belong to the same GMA. 
6.2.  Discussion and overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
As explained supra, the CHMP has assessed the scientific grounds which are detailed under the MAH’s 
request  for  re-examination.  These  scientific  grounds  revolve  around  “the  Ad  hoc  Opinion  and  the 
appended assessment report”. 
The MAH submits that the nonclinical data, together with the supposed consistency of findings across 
the  clinical  studies  with  no  significant  methodological  limitations  and  the  consistency  across  clinical 
endpoints  (which  supposedly  show  clinically  relevant  improved  efficacy  for  DMF/MEF  as  compared  to 
DMF  alone),  constitutes  good  scientific  evidence  that  MEF  contributes  to  the  clinical  efficacy  of  the 
DMF/MEF  combination  in  Fumaderm.  Further,  Biogen  relies  on  a  supporting  expert  report  from  a 
Professor. This Professor concludes that the available data from the two key studies [Mrowietz 2017; 
Nieboer 1990] do not suffer from material methodological limitations and point clearly to a contribution 
of MEF. 
In  this  context,  Biogen  raises  three  elements  that  purportedly  call  for  reconsideration  of  the  ad  hoc 
assessment that underlies the Ad Hoc Opinion. These elements are set out in detail in the expert report 
of 04 March 2022 of a Professor. These elements have been summarised by Biogen as follows: 
a.  The  nature  of  what  are  claimed  to  be  “severe  methodological  limitations”  of  the  clinical 
studies, which is relevant to how much weight can be given the various clinical studies (for 
the purpose of the present report, this consideration will be referred to as Ground 1);

b.  The  appropriateness,  in  a  historical  assessment  of  this  nature,  of  focusing  solely  on 
“statistical  significance”  in  concluding  that  MEF  does  not  exert  a  clinically  relevant 
therapeutic contribution (for the purpose of the present report, this consideration will 
be referred to as Ground 2); and 
c.  The  manner  in  which  direct  assessments  of  clinical  relevance  were  made  and  taken  into 
account in reaching the opinion (for the purpose of the present report, this consideration 
will be referred to as Ground 3). 
In  summary,  the  MAH  claims  that  the  issues  identified  under  Grounds  1,  2  and  3  have  not  been 
adequately considered and reasoned in the ad hoc assessment report that underlies the Ad Hoc Opinion 
and  that,  therefore,  the  CHMP  should  not  have  concluded,  as  it  did,  that  the  totality  of  the  available 
evidence cannot establish a finding of a relevant contribution of MEF in Fumaderm. 
Ground 1 
The MAH concedes that two of the four clinical studies indeed had methodological limitations that limit 
their  use  in  assessing  the  effect  of  MEF  within  Fumaderm.  In  this  respect,  the  MAH  focuses  on  the 
following two studies: Mrowietz et al (2017) and Nieboer et al (1990). According to the MAH, these two 
key studies did not suffer from material methodological weaknesses and support their position that MEF 
exerts a relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm.  
Nieboer et al (1990): While the CHMP recognises that a small sample size affects the precision of results 
and is not a concern per se, the principle remains that a relevant contribution of the active substance 
(as  regards  efficacy  and/or  safety)  needs  to  be  demonstrated.  In  that  regard,  in  order  to  allow  for  a 
conclusion  on  possible  existence  of  a  demonstrated  effect,  the  results  must  show  an  effect  and  it  is 
insufficient  to  simply  speculate  on  the  existence  of  an  effect  by  arguing  that  the  trial  was  not  large 
enough to elucidate it (see further the conclusion below). In that sense, a treatment effect must have 
been shown within the trial such that a trial with a small sample size can be convincing. A small sample 
size cannot be accepted as a methodological excuse in favour of a treatment effect. Nieboer et al. (1990) 
failed to demonstrate an effect of MEF within Fumaderm and therefore cannot lead to a conclusion of a 
relevant therapeutic effect.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  disagrees  that  this  trial  has  demonstrated  an  additional  and  clinically  relevant 
therapeutic effect of MEF (see further below). 
It is recognised by the CHMP that table 1 in Nieboer et al (1990) contains all randomized patients (of 
note,  with  regard  to  the  complete  case  analysis,  another  analysis  is  referred  to  in  the  ad-hoc  CHMP 
report,  i.e.  when  only  those  patients  were  considered  who  could  be  evaluated  after  16  weeks).  The 
percentage of patients with an improvement of >50% is based on the full analysis set (FAS), and it can 
be said that 45% (10/22) vs 52% (12/23) were responders based on these assessments in the DMF vs 
the FAC (the combination) treatment arm in this study. However, the difference in these estimates goes 
back  to  an  absolute  difference  of  n=2  responders  between  the  two  treatment  arms.  This  (small) 
numerical difference is not statistically significant and is a descriptive result. Further, it cannot establish 
a demonstrated true difference between the two treatments. As discussed above, the small sample size 
cannot be used as an excuse for a lack of demonstration of a treatment effect. Even the authors conclude 
that  the  treatment  with  the  combination  does  not  result  in  better  therapeutic  results  than  the  DMF 
monotherapy. 
Nieboer  et  al  (1990)  do  not  specify  control  for  multiplicity.  In  any  case,  the  overarching  and  crucial 
methodological limitation of this study revolves around the fact that it is not appropriate to conclude on 
a demonstrated effect based on numerical results, i.e. point estimates. Of note, it is even acknowledged 
by the MAH that “none of the endpoints reached conventional statistical significance”.

In conclusion, a treatment benefit of MEF within Fumaderm cannot be concluded on (see also Ground 
2). 
Mrowietz et al (2017): This is considered to be the most relevant and recent study due to the controlled 
design, sample size and research question addressed. The non-completion rate is large with an amount 
of almost 40% in both, the LAS41008 (DMF) and Fumaderm arms, and handling of missing data and 
intercurrent events is always challenging to assess from publications. With regard to multiplicity, first 
superiority  of  DMF  to  placebo,  and  thereafter  non-inferiority  to  the  combination  was  tested,  while  a 
further superiority hypothesis of Fumaderm over DMF had not been pre-specified.  
Nevertheless, these specific design aspects of the study are not the fulcrum of the discussion. The main 
“methodological  limitation”  is  related  with  the  way  how  interpretations  are  made  in  the  submitted 
grounds for re-examination and as such, the study results do not allow for a conclusion of a demonstrated 
additional contribution of MEF in the combination product Fumaderm. The CHMP strongly disagrees with 
the  MAH  that  point  estimates  and  selected  secondary  endpoints  allow  a  confirmatory  conclusion  of  a 
demonstrated therapeutic effect as such an approach is methodologically inappropriate to demonstrate 
a treatment effect. An observed point estimate alone (2.8% difference in the PASI75 and 4.4% in PGA, 
CIs not presented) in the co-primary endpoints is not sufficient to conclude on the true existence of an 
effect,  and  also  secondary  endpoints  cannot  establish  a  confirmatory  conclusion  on  efficacy.  Notably, 
this is exactly what Mrowietz et al. (2017) conclude on, i.e. that “DMF is not significantly different from 
Fumaderm  in  clinical  terms”  and  that  “MEF  salts  not  being  essential  to  achieving  a  clinically  relevant 
response”. 
In summary, the totality of the available data (including, Nieboer (1990) and Mrowietz (2017)) does not 
allow  to  establish  that  MEF  has  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  effect  and  further  confirmatory  data 
would be required to demonstrate such an effect. To that end, while there are some numerical differences 
in favour of the DMF/MEF combination vs. DMF alone, these differences do not demonstrate that MEF 
provides  a  therapeutic  contribution  as  regards  clinical  efficacy  in  addition  to  DMF  in  the  Fumaderm 
combination. Furthermore, as such conclusion on demonstrated efficacy cannot be drawn, it can also not 
be  accepted  that  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  contribution  of  MEF  within  Fumaderm  has  been 
demonstrated. 
Therefore, a re-evaluation of the available data has not altered the initial CHMP conclusion insofar as a 
clinically relevant therapeutic contribution of MEF within Fumaderm has not been demonstrated.  
Regarding  the  expert  report,  according  to  the  Professor,  the  CHMP  presents  no  concrete  reasons  for 
dismissing the Nieboer 1990 and Mrowietz 2017 studies [Mrowietz 2017; Nieboer 1990] as they were 
well-controlled  clinical  trials  with  no  severe  methodological  limitations  affecting  an  assessment  of  the 
contribution of MEF in Fumaderm. Furthermore, the Professor finds that by dismissing the Mrowietz study 
on  the  grounds  that  “the  design  of  the  study  does  not  allow  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  DMF/MEF 
versus DMF” the CHMP fails to recognize two facts. First, because the conduct of the non-inferiority and 
superiority studies differs only in sample size, it is scientifically possible to draw superiority conclusions 
from a non-inferiority trial. Superiority in [Mrowietz 2017] was demonstrated in a secondary endpoint 
which reached statistical significance, and numerical superiority was reached in the remainder of primary 
and secondary endpoints except one. Second, for a study specifically designed to demonstrate superiority 
of DMF/MEF over DMF alone and to be adequately powered, as apparently requested by the CHMP, an 
enormous study randomizing almost 4700 patients would be required. 
A  detailed  discussion  on  this  topic  is  already  provided  above,  as  the  specific  points  raised  (under 
paragraph 6 of the request for re-examination) appear to correspond to Ground 1.  
As also discussed above, the principal methodological flaw of the proposed conclusion on both studies is 
that point estimates and secondary endpoints do not suffice for the proposed conclusion of a therapeutic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 102/152 
 
 
 
contribution of MEF within DMF/MEF. For such demonstration, it is necessary that statistical significance 
of the primary endpoint(s) is shown. It is also reiterated by the CHMP, that further to this requirement 
of statistical significance, clinical relevance of an effect needs to be additionally justified. 
The controlled design, especially of the clinical study in Mrowietz et al (2017), is agreed to as theoretically 
being  appropriate  and  capable  to  demonstrate  a  potential  treatment  effect  of  MEF  in  Fumaderm. 
Nevertheless, while this is agreed the results of the trial do not allow a conclusion of a treatment effect 
of MEF within Fumaderm. As noted above from a design perspective a superiority hypothesis had not 
been specified (type I error control). While also conduct/analysis questions with regards to e.g. missing 
data  handling  generally  need  to  be  considered,  it  is  in the  light  of  the  study  results  not necessary  to 
discuss  such  in  detail  further,  as  the  primary  study  results  do  not  allow  conclusion  of  a  statistically 
demonstrated treatment effect of MEF in Fumaderm. 
The MAH further argues that a sample size of 4700 patients would be needed to have 90% power to 
show superiority of the combination over DMF monotherapy when using the results observed in Mrowietz 
et  al  (2017).  However,  this  is  not  considered  an  argument  in  favour  of  accepting  the  therapeutic 
contribution of MEF within Fumaderm; the fact that a large study would be needed to investigate the 
specific research question is not a reason to waive the need for the study. On the contrary, the large 
sample size is a function of the small numerical estimate observed and assumes this is the true effect.  
It is concluded in summary, that a contribution of a clinically relevant therapeutic effect of MEF within 
Fumaderm has not been demonstrated. 
Ground 2  
Based on the data submitted, as part of the ad hoc assessment relating to the therapeutic effect of MEF 
within Fumaderm, the CHMP concluded that a clinically relevant contribution of MEF in Fumaderm has 
not been demonstrated. 
Following  the  discussion  in  response  to  Ground  1,  it  is  reiterated  that  statistical  significance  must  be 
demonstrated  in  order  to  conclude  that  a  treatment  effect  has  been  shown  and  as  such  statistical 
significance  is  essential  to  establish  clinical  relevance.  This  is  particularly  relevant  for  the  primary 
endpoint(s)  and  a  lack  of  such  demonstration  in  the  primary  endpoint(s)  render  results  in  secondary 
endpoints as exploratory. In summary, it must be demonstrated that a statistically significant treatment 
effect  exists.  Only  once  it  is  established,  it  can  be  thereafter  assessed  whether  the  effect  is  clinically 
relevant. 
In that line of argument, while it is noted that statistical significance is not the same as clinical relevance, 
the two notions corroborate and, based on the available data, it cannot be concluded that a clinically 
relevant effect of MEF within Fumaderm has been demonstrated. A clinically relevant effect cannot be 
concluded on without having demonstrated that an effect >0 exists. 
While the meaning of p-values is well understood by the CHMP, the MAH´s conclusion that in the present 
case the point estimate can supersede non-significant results and can be interpreted as demonstrating 
a clinically relevant result is rejected. This presumption would treat the point estimate as demonstrative 
of the true effect and ignore the obvious uncertainties around the estimate. In any event, the results of 
the available clinical studies did not show that an effect exists, thereby obviating a conclusion of clinical 
relevance. Whilst it is acknowledged by the CHMP that the data do not prove the absence of an effect, 
of  more  relevance  in  the  present  context  is  that  it cannot  be  concluded  based  on  these  data  that  an 
effect has been shown.  
The  MAH  does  not  question  in  essence  that  a  therapeutic  effect  of  MEF  in  Fumaderm  has  not  been 
demonstrated by the statistical tests associated with the primary endpoints. Rather the MAH relies on 
observations  relating  to  several  endpoints,  and  the  assessment  of  relevance  of  point  estimates.  This 
Assessment report

approach  fundamentally  deviates  from  appropriate  evidence  generation  to  demonstrate  treatment 
effects.  The  consistency  of  effect  estimates  are not sufficient  to  support  on  its  own  a  conclusion  of a 
demonstrated effect. In the context of non-significant primary results such considerations are considered 
exploratory, but not confirmatory. If any, such results could motivate performing a confirmatory trial 
(see also, the response to Ground 2 below). 
It is concluded in summary, that a contribution of a (clinically relevant) treatment effect of MEF within 
Fumaderm has not been demonstrated. 
The  Professor  also  explains  that the  CHMP  was  wrong  to  focus on  statistical significance  alone  rather 
than  on  the  consistency  of  the  results  within  and  across  well-done  clinical  studies  which  support  the 
conclusion that MEF contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of the Fumaderm combination. 
In order to address this point raised by the Professor, reference is made to the statements on ‘statistical 
significance’ above. 
First, it has to be reiterated again that the (descriptive) results from both the Mrowietz et al (2017) and 
the Nieboer et al (1990) studies are not appropriate to establish a difference between the two treatments 
(DMF&MEF combination and DMF alone). The conclusions set out under both studies (and indeed, in the 
context of other studies discussed within the course of the initial ad-hoc assessment) are consistent in 
that regard.  
In terms of ‘within-study consistency’, it is again noted that endpoints in a clinical study are correlated, 
based on same patients, and cannot be regarded as independent replication.  
As  an  additional  remark,  there  were  ‘inconsistent’  numerical  results  across  Nieboer  et  al.,  1990  and 
Nieboer  et  al.,  1989;  e.g.,  for  the  parameters  redness  and  induration  scores,  scaling  and  itching. 
Mrowietz et al. (2017) showed ‘inconsistent’ trends for changes in PASI and PGA versus change in BSA.  
It seems likely that some of these differences are attributed to chance alone. 
An  important  aspect  for  assessments  of  ‘consistency’  is  the  availability  of  a  balanced  and  complete 
literature dataset. To assess coherence of results across clinical trials, indirect comparison of data that 
have been generated from different studies is made. In that regard, it is worth highlighting that literature 
reviews  have  been  conducted  by  several  entities  during  the  initial  ad-hoc  assessment.  For  the  re-
assessment, the expert report also refers to scientific literature. While not all entities have outlined their 
exact methodology for bibliographic research, some (e.g., BfArM) have provided many details on their 
search  strategy.  Taking  into  account  the  available  data,  including  the  data  provided  by  the  different 
entities, as well as results from a literature review performed during this procedure, the CHMP concludes 
with sufficient certainty that the most relevant accessible publications on the issue have been identified 
(and  discussed  at  various  time  points  during  the  process).  For  the  present  question,  the  two  most 
relevant publications are indeed Nieboer et al., 1990, and Mrowietz et al (2017) due to the design of the 
respective studies and respective questions addressed. 
There  is  no  meta-analysis  available  on  whether  MEF  exerts  a  clinically  relevant  effect  in  Fumaderm. 
However, a Cochrane Review from 2015 on oral fumaric acid esters (FAEs) has been reviewed for this 
application. The researchers from Cochrane, a well-established scientific community specialised in the 
assessment of meta-analyses and systematic reviews, selected randomised controlled trials with FAEs, 
including DMF monotherapy in the indication psoriasis. Six trials were included into the Cochrane Review: 
Altmeyer, 1994; Nugteren-Huying, 1990; Fallah Arani, 2011; Peeters, 1992; Langner 2004; Mrowietz 
2006. The authors of the Cochrane review were unable to establish if the use of DMF alone has a similar 
efficacy and safety profile as the combination of DMF plus MEF. They furthermore concluded that “the 
evidence provided in this review was limited, and it must be noted, that four out of six included studies 
were abstracts or brief reports, restricting study reporting”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 104/152 
 
 
 
It is acknowledged that some studies were not included in the Cochrane review (given that the Cochrane 
review was performed before Mrowietz et al. 2017 was published), but, based on the reported Mrowietz 
et al. 2017 results (and the discussion of the Mrowietz et al. 2017 study above), it is not expected that 
this conclusion would change. 
The Mrowietz et al. 2017 data were included in the literature review on the topic by Landeck et al. 2018: 
‘Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) vs. monoethyl fumarate (MEF) salts for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: a 
review of clinical data’. In the context of that review, the authors concluded that ‘DMF as monotherapy 
for the treatment of psoriasis is as efficacious as in combination with MEF, making the addition of such 
fumarate derivatives unnecessary’. 
Ground 3 
The  MAH  criticizes  the  CHMP  conclusions  on  clinical  relevance  in  the  ad-hoc  assessment.  The  initial 
assessment  concluded  that  a  clinically  relevant  contribution  of  MEF  within  the  MEF&DMF  combination 
product has not been demonstrated. This conclusion is also maintained under the present re-examination 
procedure (see, the responses to Grounds 1, 2 and 3 and the conclusion). 
As outlined above, data have been assessed and evaluated based on the principles of evidenced-based 
medicine and by looking at the totality of available data.  
As the relevant studies failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect, any assessment of clinical 
relevance of a (non-existing) effect becomes irrelevant. 
The  MAH’s  argument  regarding  claimed  consistency  of  sufficiently  favourable  findings  across  clinical 
studies demonstrating a treatment effect of MEF  can therefore not be followed. Lack of a statistically 
significant results have been consistently seen and as such, numerical differences of point estimates only 
cannot be regarded as a reliable basis to draw firm conclusions on a potential treatment effect. 
The MAH submits that, by reference to the expert report, the CHMP Opinion does not evaluate whether 
the size of the differences between DMF/MEF and DMF seen in the [Nieboer 1990] and [Mrowietz 2017] 
studies constitute clinically relevant differences. According to the Professor, the two studies are broadly 
compatible  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  Indicated  for  the 
Treatment of Psoriasis (2005). The Professor states that quantitative differences between DMF/MEF and 
DMF alone include the following: 
a.  In the BRIDGE Study [Mrowietz 2017], the odds of having a better outcome on the 
PASI scale were 1.3 times greater for Fumaderm than for DMF. 
b.  Success rates were 16%, 8%, and 22% greater for Fumaderm patients than for DMF 
monotherapy patients, using the PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 criteria, respectively. 
From a clinical perspective, this means that 22% more patients would achieve at least 
a  90%  improvement  using  Fumaderm  instead  of  DMF  monotherapy—at  least  one 
additional success with Fumaderm for every four successful results that would have 
been achieved with DMF alone. 
c.  Success  in  achieving  clear  or  almost  clear  results  (PGA)  was  seen  in  13%  more 
patients receiving Fumaderm than in patients receiving DMF monotherapy. 
d.  In Nieboer 1990, for patients who tolerated their respective treatments, the odds of 
having a better outcome were 3.5 times greater for the combination than for DMF 
e.  In Nieboer 1990, the average total psoriasis score was lower for the combination than 
for DMF at every time point post-randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 105/152 
 
 
 
f. 
In  Nieboer  1990,  the  average  subscale  score  was  the  same  or  lower  for  the 
combination than for DMF at every time point for four of the five subscales (induration, 
scaling, redness, and itching), and was virtually the same for the fifth scale (extent 
of eruption) at every time point except the last (which favored DMF) [Nieboer 1990], 
Figure 1]. 
g.  The  time  course  of  these  symptoms  as  reported  indicates  that  even  when  the 
effectiveness of the combination and DMF were similar at the four-month endpoint, 
that effectiveness was achieved earlier for combination patients than for DMF patients. 
[Nieboer 1990], Figure 1]. 
It is again reiterated that numerical differences in point estimates cannot be interpreted as representing 
a true treatment effect (neither a confirmation that a true effect exists nor that this difference reflects 
the  true  difference).  In  fact,  there  is  (large)  uncertainty  around  point  estimates  and  due  to  the 
insignificance of the results even a detrimental effect cannot be excluded. In consequence, the evaluation 
of clinical relevance, which is put forward on the basis of the existence of such numerical differences is 
rejected. Furthermore, it is not considered acceptable to draw conclusions based on selected (secondary) 
endpoints for which positive trends were observed.  The above presented bullet points are considered 
data driven post hoc claims of selected outcomes. Therefore, any further comments on items a)-g) are 
irrelevant. 
Based  on  the  evidence  from  the  two  clinical  studies,  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  that  a  therapeutic 
effect  for  MEF  in  Fumaderm  has  been  demonstrated,  as  the  point  estimates  and  secondary  outcome 
measures alone are not sufficient to support such a conclusion. 
According  to  the  Professor,  physicians  and  patients  would  consider  each  of  these  improvements  in 
clinically relevant efficacy measures to be themselves clinically relevant, and each of these improvements 
indicate that the presence of MEF contributes to the efficacy of the combination product. 
The  conceptual  argument  that  physicians  and  patients  would  consider  each  of  the  purported 
improvements listed under items a. to g. as clinically relevant is considered to be exceedingly vague and 
unsubstantiated.  
The totality of the available data neither showed a statistically significant result nor a clinically relevant 
effect (see also, the response to Grounds 1 and 3). The numerical differences shown cannot establish a 
difference between the two treatments (DMF alone and DMF & MEF combined). A relevant contribution 
of MEF within Fumaderm is not currently established and the above argument cannot be accepted. As 
explained, the study results do not support the conclusion that numerical differences can be considered 
a  “true”  difference  and  hence  any  considerations  whether  these  numerical  differences  are  clinically 
relevant or not are obsolete. The above argument under Ground 3 is therefore rejected. 
On the basis of the above, the Professor concludes as follows: 
“It is essential to recognize that statistical significance and clinical relevance are separate assessments, 
and that not exhibiting statistical significance is not grounds for concluding that that there is no effect, 
i.e., that MEF does not contribute to the therapeutic effect of DMF/MEF. 
To the contrary, in view of the consistency of findings across studies as well as consistency across clinical 
endpoints, which show clinically relevant improved efficacy for DMF/MEF as compared to DMF alone, it 
is my opinion that MEF exhibits a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within DMF/MEF therapy.” 
In  order  to  address  this  point  reference  is  made  to  the  discussion  on  the  other  clinical  grounds  as 
presented above. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 106/152 
 
 
 
 
It  is  acknowledged  that  statistical  significance  and  clinical  relevance  are  different  considerations, 
however, they are certainly interrelated/interdependent. For regulatory decision making, first it must be 
demonstrated that a “true” treatment effect exists, demonstrated by a statistically significant treatment 
effect. Thereupon it can be assessed whether the treatment is clinically relevant. Accordingly, as a first 
step,  statistical  demonstration  of  ‘an’  effect  is  necessary,  which  can  thereafter  in  a  second  step  be 
evaluated  to  be  clinically  relevant  or  not.  In  the  present  case  neither  a  statistically  significant  nor  a 
clinically relevant effect could be demonstrated for MEF that would contribute to the therapeutic effect 
of DMF/MEF. 
Whilst it is acknowledged that the data do not prove the absence of an effect, it cannot be concluded 
that an effect exists. In that respect, it should be emphasised that scientific opinions are based on proven 
or actual evidence and not on missing evidence. 
As regards the supposed existence of consistency of findings, this claim has been discussed under the 
response  to  Ground  2.  Study  results  are  rather  consistent  in  that  no  difference  between  the  two 
treatments could be established. 
It  is  not  agreed  that  across-study  observations  are  capable  of  demonstrating  a  clinically  relevant 
therapeutic contribution of MEF within DMF/MEF therapy. 
Conclusion 
As explained above, the CHMP examined whether MEF exerts a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution 
within  Fumaderm  in  patients  with  psoriasis.  The  issue  was  assessed  in  the  context  of  an  ad  hoc 
assessment  relating  to  the  therapeutic  effect  of  MEF  within  Fumaderm  (under  procedure 
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022). By its Opinion on 11 November 2021, the CHMP concluded that the totality 
of  the  available  data  cannot  establish  that  MEF  exerts  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  effect  within 
Fumaderm. 
The outcome of that assessment was of direct relevance when assessing the MAH’s application for a type 
II variation for Tecfidera (EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0073). More particularly, it was of direct relevance for 
the  MAH’s  accompanying  request  for  an  extension  of  marketing  protection  of  one  additional  year  for 
Tecfidera  in  accordance  with  Article  14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  due  to  the  claimed 
significant clinical benefit of the new indication. 
While the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance was favourable and the type II variation to the 
terms of the marketing authorisation for Tecfidera could be granted, the additional year of marketing 
protection could not be recommended for the reasons set under Section 5 of the present report.  
On 8 March 2022, the MAH submitted its detailed grounds for re-examination of the CHMP Opinion of 27 
January  2022  relating  to  its  type  II  variation  application.  That  request  for  re-examination  was  also 
directed against the CHMP Opinion of 11 November 2021. The CHMP focused it’s reassessment on the 
section concerning the “Grounds in relation to the Ad Hoc Opinion and the appended ad hoc assessment” 
of the request for re-examination. In particular, the CHMP examined the three elements raised by the 
MAH that purportedly call for reconsideration of the CHMP Ad Hoc Assessment Report of 11 November 
2021. Those elements have been categorised as Grounds 1, 2 and 3 under the present report and focus, 
in particular, on the following clinical studies Nieboer et al. (1990) and Mrowietz et al. (2017). 
The MAH questioned the initial assessment and raised objections in relation to: 
- 
- 
The assessment of study methodology  
The assessment of the quantitative differences observed in the two studies between DMF/MEF 
and DMF alone 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022

- 
- 
The assessment of statistical significance and clinical relevance 
The assessment of consistency of study results within the individual studies and across studies 
The  main  point  of  discussion,  raised  in  the  grounds  and  re-assessed  as  part  of  this  re-examination 
procedure, lay on the methodological limitations of the 2 main studies mentioned above and how the 
results  have  been  interpreted  by  the  MAH  and  CHMP.  Having  assessed  all  available  data,  the  CHMP 
concluded that numerical results (i.e. point estimates and selected secondary endpoints) are not enough 
to demonstrate an effect of MEF. A treatment effect of MEF in Fumaderm, as claimed by the MAH, has 
not been demonstrated in either study. 
In order to demonstrate the existence of a treatment effect, it is required that statistical significance is 
achieved. This is of particular importance when interpreting results for the primary endpoint(s); lack of 
such  demonstration  in  the  primary  endpoint(s)  render  results  in  secondary  endpoints  as exploratory. 
Thereby the notion that regulators require statistically significant results for decision making to allow a 
conclusion on clinical relevance is correct. First, it must be demonstrated that a statistically significant 
treatment effect exists. Only once such is established, it can thereafter in a second step be assessed 
whether the observed results reach a size of clinical relevance or not. 
In that sense, while it is agreed that statistical significance is not the same as clinical relevance, it cannot 
be concluded that a clinically relevant effect of MEF contribution in Fumaderm has been demonstrated. 
A clinically relevant effect cannot be concluded on without having demonstrated that an effect >0 exists. 
The MAH’s conclusion that in the present case the point estimate can supersede non-significant results 
and can be interpreted as demonstrating a clinically relevant result is strongly rejected. This presumption 
would take the point estimate as demonstrative of the true effect and ignore the obvious uncertainties 
around the estimate. 
The  conclusion  that  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  effect  of  MEF  within  Fumaderm  has  not  been 
demonstrated is the same for both studies, and the results are consistent in that regard. 
Overall conclusion: 
The CHMP, having taken into consideration the scientific grounds raised by the MAH in relation to the 
scientific  conclusions  outlined  in  the  CHMP  Opinion  of  11  November  2021,  and  the  available  data 
(including, Nieboer et al. (1990) and Mrowietz et al. (2017)) has not altered its initial conclusion insofar 
as a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution of MEF  within Fumaderm has not been demonstrated. 
Therefore,  the  grant  of  one-year  of  additional  marketing  authorisation  for  Tecfidera  cannot  be 
recommended at this time.

C.I.6 (Extension of indication) type II Art.29 Extension of indication to include treatment of relapsing 
remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS)  in  paediatrics  patients  from  13  years  of  age  and  over;  as  a 
consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The risk management plan (RMP) is updated to version 13 based on Study 109MS306 data supporting 
the request for a paediatric indication. The marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to update 
the RMP with the most updated data (Part II modules SIV, SV and SVII).  
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing protection of one additional year in accordance with 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0177/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product

Additional market protection 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) 
of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  and  the  “Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant 
clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit 
from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period”,22 and  considers  that  the  new  therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1). 
However, by its Judgment of 5 May 2021 in Case T-611/18, Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma v EMA,23 
the  General  Court  held  that  Tecfidera  does  not  benefit  from  an  independent  global  marketing 
authorisation.  EMA  has  lodged  an  appeal  against  the  General  Court’s  ruling,  and  the  appellate 
proceedings  are  pending.  Nevertheless,  for  the  purpose  of  implementing  the  General  Court’s  ruling, 
but without prejudice to its position in the appellate proceedings, the Agency has conducted an ad hoc 
assessment relating to the therapeutic effect of monoethyl fumarate salts (MEF) within Fumaderm (in 
this respect, see the Opinion adopted by the CHMP on 11 November 202124 and appended as an Annex 
to the CHMP assessment report on the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies 
in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ).  
In  light of  the  scientific  conclusions  outlined in its  Opinion  of  11  November  2021,  and based on the 
assessment of the scientific grounds raised by the MAH in relation to the scientific conclusions outlined 
in the CHMP Opinion of 11 November 2021, and a re-evaluation of the available data (including, Nieboer

et al. (1990) and Mrowietz et al. (2017), the CHMP is of the view that the totality of the available data 
cannot establish that MEF exerts a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm. Those 
scientific conclusions and the Judgment of the General Court of 5 May 2021 in Case T-611/18 support 
the determination that Tecfidera does not benefit from an independent global marketing authorisation. 
This also entails that, following the General Court’s reasoning, Tecfidera could not benefit, at the time 
of the submission of this type II variation application, from any marketing protection. As a result, and 
without prejudice to the outcome of the above referenced appellate proceedings, the CHMP having re-
examined its initial opinion on the granting of an additional one-year of marketing protection period for 
Tecfidera  and  in  its  final  opinion  considers  by  consensus  that  the  granting  of  one-year  of  additional 
marketing authorisation cannot be recommended at this time.

1.  Background information 
On 9 August 1994, the German National Competent Authority (the Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und 
Medizinprodukte;  “BfArM”)  granted  two  marketing  authorisations  for  two  strengths  of  a  combination 
medicinal product known as Fumaderm (comprised of the active substances monoethyl fumarate salts 
(“MEF”) and dimethyl fumarate (“DMF”)), for the treatment of psoriasis. On 13 June 2013, the marketing 
authorisations for Fumaderm were renewed. The marketing authorisations (“MA”) are held by the Biogen 
group of companies.25 
Fumaderm was authorised for the treatment of psoriasis in two strengths: (i) Fumaderm initial contains 
30  mg  of  DMF,  67  mg  of  calcium  MEF  salt,  5  mg  of  magnesium  MEF  salt  and  3  mg  of  zinc  MEF  salt 
(“Fumaderm initial”); and (ii) Fumaderm contains 120 mg of DMF, 87 mg of calcium MEF salt, 5 mg of 
magnesium  MEF  salt  and  3  mg  of  zinc  MEF  salt  (“Fumaderm”).  The  term  “Fumaderm”  will  be  used 
throughout the assessment report to refer indistinctively to both marketing authorisations. 
On 30 January 2014, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation (“MA”) to the Biogen 
group  of  companies  for  the  medicinal  product  Tecfidera  (comprised  of  the  active  substance  DMF).26 
Tecfidera is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Recital 3 of the Commission decision for Tecfidera stated that Tecfidera is not covered by the same global 
marketing authorisation (“GMA”) as the previously authorised combination medicinal product Fumaderm. 
This  was  based  on  the  conclusion  (reached  during  the  assessment  of  the  marketing  authorisation 
application  (“MAA”)  for  Tecfidera)  that  MEF  and  DMF  are  both  active  and  are  not  the  same  active 
substance, since they do not contain the same therapeutic moiety.  
On 27 June 2018, Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma (“Polpharma”) submitted a MAA for a generic version 
of Tecfidera pursuant to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. By its decision of 30 July 2018, the EMA 
refused  to  validate  Polpharma’s  application  on  the  basis  that  Tecfidera  was  still  subject  to  regulatory 
data protection. On 9 October 2018, Polpharma initiated court proceedings by submitting an application 
for annulment against EMA’s decision to not validate its MAA. Polpharma also submitted a plea of illegality 
against Recital 3 of the Commission decision for Tecfidera that concluded that Tecfidera is entitled to a 
separate GMA to that of Fumaderm.27 
On 23 July 2020, Mylan Ireland Limited (“Mylan”) submitted a MAA for a generic version of Tecfidera 
pursuant to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  By its decision of 1 October 2020, EMA refused to 
validate Mylan’s application. On 28 October 2020, Mylan commenced court proceedings by submitting 
an application for annulment against EMA’s decision to not validate its application, as well as a plea of 
illegality against Recital 3 of the Commission decision for Tecfidera.28 
By its Judgment of 5 May 2021, the General Court annulled EMA’s decision to not validate Polpharma’s 
MAA and concluded that the plea of illegality against the Commission decision for Tecfidera should be 
upheld.  The  General  Court  held that  the  Commission  was  not  entitled to  conclude  that  Tecfidera  was 
covered  by  a  different  GMA  to  that  of  Fumaderm,  without  verifying  or  requesting  the  CHMP  to  verify 
whether and, if necessary, how the BfArM had assessed the role of MEF within Fumaderm, or without 
requesting the CHMP to verify the role played by MEF within Fumaderm.29

On 2 June 2021, Biogen submitted a type II variation application for the medicinal product Tecfidera, 
seeking at the same time the extension of the marketing protection of Tecfidera by one year (further to 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004). 
For the purpose of the implementation of the Judgment of the General Court of 5 May 2021 in Case T-
611/18,  Pharmaceutical  Works  Polpharma  v  EMA,  and  in  connection  to  the  above-mentioned  three 
pending applications before the CHMP which concern DMF (two MAAs for a generic version of Tecfidera; 
and a type II variation for Tecfidera), the CHMP is being asked to examine whether MEF exerts a 
clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm.  
In that connection, it may be pointed out that in the situation whereby the General Court annuls an act 
of an institution or body, it is required, in accordance with Article 266 of the Treaty on the Functioning 
of the European Union, to take measures necessary to comply with that judgment. The present ad hoc 
assessment is considered to conform to that requirement in view of the particular findings of the General 
Court in Case T-611/18.  
In light of the above, the objective of this assessment is to support the determination as regards whether 
Tecfidera  is  covered  by  the  same  GMA  as  Fumaderm  within  the  meaning  of  Article  6(1),  second 
subparagraph, of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.  Assessment 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  aim  of  this  assessment  report  (“AR”)  is  to  examine  whether  MEF  exerts  a  clinically  relevant 
therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm.  
This AR is based on the original publications of the studies mentioned below.  This AR has taken account 
of the European Public Assessment Reports (“EPARs”) for Tecfidera and Skilarence and the responses to 
the LoQ, sent to the EMA by the following interested entities: 
-  German  National  Competent  Authority  (the  Bundesinstitut  für  Arzneimittel  und  Medizinprodukte; 
BfArM) 
-  Biogen Netherlands B.V. 
-  Mylan Ireland Limited 
- 
Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma  
In addition, the assessment has taken account of an unsolicited submission from another company.  
As indicated above, two strengths of Fumaderm were granted marketing authorisations as combination 
medicinal products on 9 August 1994. Those marketing authorisations came into force in Germany on 
19 August 1994.  
DMF and MEF are esters of fumaric acid. DMF is pre-systemically hydrolysed by ubiquitous esterases to 
its major active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). 
Likewise, MEF is metabolized by esterases to FA. 
Two types of Fumaderm have been licensed in Germany, which serve for titration during the initial three 
weeks  of  treatment  (“Fumaderm  initial  magensaftresistente  Tabletten  für  Erwachsene”,  German  MA 
number  27561.00.00)  and  in  the  subsequent  weeks  including  maintenance  of  therapy  (“Fumaderm

Page 116/152 
 
 
 
 
magensaftresistente Tabletten für Erwachsene”, German MA number 27561.01.00; hereafter referred to 
as Fumaderm). 
The following table compares the composition of the two authorised Fumaderm products:

Fumaderm initial (30 mg) is the starting dose, which is increased week by week to improve tolerability, 
particularly to decrease gastrointestinal side-effects, and Fumaderm (120 mg) is the higher-dosed tablet 
which is applied starting from week 4. The maximum dose of Fumaderm is 720 mg/day. The appropriate 
dose for most patients is 240-480 mg/day. Current German guidelines recommend a gradual increase 
in fumaric acid ester (FAE) dosage to determine optimal efficacy and tolerability for each patient. 
Currently, two medicinal products containing DMF as gastro-resistant tablets are approved for psoriasis: 
Fumaderm, a fixed combination of DMF + MEF salts, and Skilarence, which contains only DMF.  
To  support  the  Fumaderm  MA,  a  randomised,  multi-center,  double-blind  study  was  submitted 
comparing Fumaderm to placebo (Altmeyer et al., 1994). 
Skilarence (EMEA/H/C/2157), MA holder Almirall S.A., was approved on 21th April 2017 in a centralised 
procedure via Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC - full mixed application. The applicant indicated that 
DMF was considered to be a known active substance. 
The only active substance in Skilarence is DMF (30 mg and 120 mg) and the DMF content is exactly the 
same as in Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm respectively. As part of the MAA for Skilarence, a pivotal 
phase III study comparing Skilarence to Fumaderm and placebo had been submitted. 
Tecfidera, 120 mg and 240 mg, gastro-resistant hard capsules, which contains only the active substance 
DMF, has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
The legal basis for this MAA referred to Article 8(3) of Directive No 2001/83/EC (full mixed application). 
The clinical development programme consisted of one phase II placebo controlled study (Study C1900) 
and  two  phase  III  studies,  one  placebo  controlled  (Study  109MS301)  and  one  placebo  and  active 
controlled - glatiramer acetate (Study 109MS302). In addition interim data from an ongoing extension 
study of the 2 phase III studies (Study 109MS303) were provided (Tecfidera, EPAR). 
2.2.  Assessment of the therapeutic contribution of MEF within Fumaderm  
2.2.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic activities of fumaric acid esters in relation to psoriasis 
At the time of assessment of the MAA of Fumaderm in Germany, the mechanism of action of its DMF and 
MEF  active  substances  was  largely  unknown  considering  also  that  relevant  animal  models  reflecting 
human psoriasis were not available. For this reason, presumptive pharmacodynamic effects of these FAE 
were  solely  based  on  clinical  experience  in  psoriasis  patients  and  experimental  findings  gained  in 
CHMP Assessment Report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 117/152 
 
 
 
 
 
pertinent cell culture systems in vitro, which were subsequently complemented by published scientific 
reports as further delineated below. 
Early  publications  had  described  the  concentration-dependent  inhibition  of  nucleic  acid  synthesis  at 
≥10 µg/ml MEF in cultures of activated lymphocytes from healthy human subjects (Petres et al., 1975; 
Hagedorn  et al.,  1975).  Based  on  these  findings,  another  in vitro  screen  submitted  during  MAA  of 
Fumaderm  compared  the  activities  of  DMF  and  the  calcium,  magnesium  and  zinc  salts  of  MEF  on 
fibroblasts prepared from healthy as well as from uninvolved and involved psoriatic human skin (Sarheim 
et al.,  1990).  As  fumarate  is  endogenously  synthesized  from  succinate  by  succinate  dehydrogenase 
(SUDH) in the citric acid cycle, the impact of the various FAEs was determined by means of succinate 
dehydrogenase activity in the different fibroblast preparations. 
Compared to fibroblasts from healthy subjects, the basal SUDH activity was about 2- to 6-fold higher in 
uninvolved psoriatic fibroblasts, which additionally showed pronounced inter-individual variability (n=6-
8 cultures  of  5 different  donors,  respectively).  When  fibroblast  preparations  from  uninvolved  and 
involved skin from the same psoriasis patient were analysed, the SUDH activity was approximately 2.8- 
or 3.4-fold lower in the involved compared to uninvolved skin (n=2). Consequently, the influence of the 
various FAE on absolute SUDH activity in fibroblasts from the three sources cannot be directly compared. 
Instead,  the  comparison  of  relative  magnitudes  of  the  stimulatory/inhibitory  effects  in  healthy  and 
uninvolved psoriatic skin is more meaningful as depicted in Table 2. 
In fibroblasts derived from healthy skin, SUDH activity was inhibited at low concentrations of FAE, but a 
concentration-dependent stimulation was noted at ≥0.03 mEq./l of DMF (Table 2). SUDH activation was 
lower at ≥0.3mEq./l for MMF and MEFs. In contrast, FA was rather inactive, which coincides with its poor 
penetration across cellular membranes (Nieboer et al., 1989). 
In fibroblasts from uninvolved psoriatic skin, the stimulation of SUDH generally prevailed for all FAEs 
(Table 2). As in healthy skin, DMF and MMF revealed higher SUDH stimulation in uninvolved psoriatic 
skin than the MEF salts, but the magnitude of the activation was more pronounced (Table 2). Among 
MEF  salts,  calcium-MEF  induced  higher  SUDH  activity  compared  to  the  zinc  and  magnesium  salts.  Of 
note,  the  strongest  SUDH  stimulation  was  already  evident  at  0.03 mEq./l  of  all  FAE,  but  declined  at 
higher concentrations, which suggests a negative feedback effect of the accumulating fumarate leading 
to the inhibition of cellular proliferation due to blockade of the citric acid cycle.

The comparison of SUDH  stimulation in fibroblasts from uninvolved and involved psoriatic skin of the 
same patient was limited to the strongest activators, i.e. DMF and Ca-MEF (Table 3). DMF significantly 
activated  SUDH  function  at  low  concentrations  of  ≥0.03 mEq./l  in  uninvolved  skin,  whereas  the 
magnitude  of  the  stimulation  was  comparable  at  higher  levels.  In  contrast,  Ca-MEF  did  not  induce 
relevant SUDH activation in fibroblasts of involved compared to the clear concentration-dependent effect 
in uninvolved psoriatic skin (Table 3). Thus, DMF and MEF apparently exert different grades of SUDH 
stimulation in skin fibroblasts with higher SUDH activity in psoriasis patients than in healthy subjects.

In  line  with  these  findings,  DMF  and  the  different  MEF  salts  but  not  fumaric  acid  interfered  with 
proliferation of immortal HaCaT keratinocytes as determined by inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis 
(Sebök  et al.,  1994).  DMF  was  the  most  potent  anti-proliferative  agent  at  all  test  concentrations 
≥0.4 µM,  while  Ca-MEF,  Zn-MEF  and  Mg-MEF  were  less  active  at  ≥1.3 µM,  ≥35 µM  and  ≥35 µM, 
respectively. Accordingly, IC50 values for blockade of DNA and protein synthesis of 2.3 and 2.5 µM DMF,

133 µM and 145 µM Zn-MEF, 215 and 230 µM Ca-MEF, 275 µM and 270 µM Mg-MEF were derived. All 
FAE exerted significant cytotoxicity as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of ≥12 µM 
DMF and Ca-MEF or ≥35 µM Zn-MEF or Mg-MEF each. 
Subsequently, the same group reported that DMF significantly suppressed the expression of Intercellular 
Adhesion  Molecule 1  (ICAM-1)  at  ≥4 µM  and  of  the  Human  Leukocyte  Antigen-DR  (HLA-DR)  on 
hyperproliferative HaCaT keratinocytes at ≥1.3 µM, i.e. two markers that are thought to induce leukocyte 
accumulation within psoriatic plaques (Sebök et al., 1998). In contrast, higher concentrations ≥106 µM 
Ca-, Zn- or Mg-MEF salts were required for ICAM-1 and HLA-DR down-regulation in HaCaT keratinocytes, 
while FA was ineffective. In normal human keratinocytes, even DMF concentrations up to 35 µM did not 
inhibit ICAM-1 and HLA-DR expression. 
Another in vitro study indicated that DMF, MMF and MEF (not as salt with metal cation) induced a rapid 
but  transient  increase  of  calcium  in  cultures  of  normal  human  keratinocytes  or  simian  virus 40-
transformed  immortal  keratinocytes  (SVK-14  cells)  as  measured  spectrophotometrically  with  the 
calcium-binding  fluorescent  dye  Fura-2  (Thio  et al.,  1994).  Maximum  calcium  elevations  were 
determined after 10 sec, were greater in normal compared to transformed keratinocytes and returned 
to basal levels within 90 to 120 sec. These calcium elevations were not blocked by pre-incubation with 
the  bivalent  cation  chelator  ethylenglycol-bis(aminoethylether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic  acid  (EGTA) 
suggesting calcium release from intracellular stores. The calcium increase was concentration-dependent 
and reached its maximum at 0.2 mM MMF, 0.4 mM  DMF and 0.2 mM MEF. Among the three FAE, the 
potency  was  MMF  >DMF  >MEF.  In  gross  concordance  with  the  aforementioned  results  of  Sebök  and 
colleagues (1994), higher concentrations of ≥10 µM DMF, ≥100 µM MMF or MEF, but not fumaric acid, 
were found to inhibit the proliferation of both types of keratinocytes. Contrary to Sebök et al. (1994), 
however, no direct cytotoxicity was observed by means of LDH increase at concentrations up to 0.2 mM 
DMF and 0.8 mM MMF or MEF. 
Thus, DMF was clearly more potent than the MEF salts to inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes. 
Pharmacodynamic activity of MEF compared to DMF and MMF 
In the dossier for the MAA of Tecfidera, DMF was shown to activate the ubiquitous transcription factor 
“Nuclear  factor  erythroid 2-related  factor 2”  (Nrf2)  in  primary  cells  of  mice,  rats  and  humans.  Nrf2 
regulates cellular antioxidant defence mechanisms. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is repressed due to 
its interaction with “Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1” 
(Keap 1), which leads to proteosomal degradation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. DMF and its primary active 
metabolite  mono-methyl  fumarate  (MMF)  both  directly  alkylate  Keap 1,  thereby  releasing  Nrf 2  from 
Keap 1 repression. Nrf 2 then translocates into the nucleus, where it activates expression of antioxidant 
and stress-associated genes by binding to the ARE sequence within their promoter regions (e.g. NADPH 
dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1), glutathione reductase and aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B8 
(Akr1b8)). This protection against oxidative stress was evident in astrocytes by increased cellular redox 
and mitochondrial membrane potentials, elevated glutathione and ATP levels and resistance against H2O2 
treatment. 
In vivo, tissue-dependent induction of Nrf2 target genes by DMF was shown in mice (NQO1 in lymphoid 
organs  and  Akr1b8  in  gastrointestinal  tissues).  The  dependency  of  oxidative  protection  on  Nrf2  was 
confirmed  by  silencing  of  Nrf2  transcription  with  specific  siRNA  and  in vivo  by  the  lack  of  a 
pharmacodynamic  response  in  Nrf2-/-  knockout  mice.  Furthermore,  DMF  dose-dependently  improved 
disease symptoms (demyelination and cell degeneration) and functional abilities in the EAE model of MS 
in rats. In addition, DMF significantly diminished excitotoxic lesions and improved neuronal survival as 
well as functional outcome evoked by the mitochondrial toxicant malonate in rats.

Moreover,  DMF  and  MMF  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory  activity  by  the  suppression  of 
lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of inflammatory cytokines in vitro (TNFα, IL1β, CXCL10, CCL4). 
This anti-inflammatory effect relied on Nrf2 at low levels of DMF or MMF, but became independent at 
high concentrations, which was apparent in macrophages prepared from WT and Nrf2-/- mice. DMF also 
reduced  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  a  collagen-induced  arthritis  model  in  rats  and  interfered  with 
activation of astrocytes, microglia and macrophages as well as T-cell infiltration in an EAE model in rats. 
Thus,  the  apparent  contribution  of  Nrf2-dependent  and  independent  transcriptional  regulation  to  the 
anti-inflammatory activities of DMF remains to be completely unravelled. 
In  investigations  provided  under  the  MAA  of  Tecfidera,  MEF  salts  were  tested  in  the  range  of  0  – 
12 µg/ml, which encompasses its known peak plasma concentrations in humans. Of note, the median 
Cmax  of  MEF  in  psoriasis  patients  receiving  two  tablets  of  Fumaderm  was  5.2 µM,  which  equates  to 
approximately  0.75 µg/ml  (Rostami-Yazdi  et al.,  2010).  However,  plasma  concentrations  may  not 
accurately reflect the exposure to MEF in certain tissues and locally in the intestinal mucosa, which would 
be expected to be much higher based on the site of absorption. Consequently, higher MEF concentrations 
were also tested in vitro. 
In all non-clinical investigations, the ratio of the calcium, magnesium, and zinc salts of MEF was 87:5:3 
Ca-MEF, Mg-MEF, Zn-MEF, respectively, based on molecular weight. This reflects the ratio of these MEF 
salts in Fumaderm. 
Overall, non-clinical results to corroborate a pharmacological activity of MEF indicate the following: 
1.)  The individual calcium, magnesium and zinc salts of MEF or a mixture of the three MEF salts induce 
Nrf2 in COS-1 cells in vitro. 
The individual MEF salts, the free acid of MEF, DMF and MMF similarly increase Nrf2 concentrations 
as analysed by Western blotting, whereas FA was ineffective (Figure 1). 
Figure 4: MEF salts increase Nrf2 protein in Cos-1 cells 
COS-1 cells were treated with 9 µg/ml of individual calcium, magnesium or zinc salts of MEF, with a mixture of MEF 
salts, the free acid form of MEF, DMF, MMF, FA or the vehicle control DMSO (boxed in red) to illustrate the basal Nrf2 
level. Cells were harvested after 24 h and extracts analysed by Western blot with antibodies against Nrf2 or actin 
(loading  control). Densitometry  of Western blot  signals  reveals  an  approximate  5-fold  increase  in  Nrf2  in  samples 
treated with FAE compared to the vehicle control.

2.)  The  mixture  of  calcium,  magnesium  and  zinc  salts  of  MEF  covalently  modifies  Keap1  at  Cys151 
in vitro. 
Following incubation of transfected HEK293 cells with a mixture of the calcium, magnesium and zinc 
salts  of  MEF,  the  modification  of  Keap 1  was  analysed  by  liquid  chromatography  and  mass 
spectrometry  (Figure 2).  The  same  modification  of  Keap 1  at  Cys151  had  been  previously 
demonstrated  for  DMF  and  MMF.  As  known  for  DMF,  MEF  is,  hence,  able  to  release  Nrf2  from 
constitutive Keap 1 repression. 
Figure 5: The mixture of MEF salts modifies Keap 1 at Cys151 
HEK293 cells were transfected with Keap1 and subsequently treated with either DMSO (control) or 3 or 6 µg/ml of 
calcium,  magnesium  and  zinc  salts  of  MEF.  Keap1was  immunopurified,  fractioned  by  gel  electrophoresis  and  then 
excised from the gel. The gel slice was reduced by DTT, alkylated by iodoacetamide, digested with trypsin, and then 
deglycosylated with PNGaseF. Resultant peptide pools were separated on a Dionex C18 column and analysed on a 
Thermo Fisher LTQ FT Ultra Hybrid mass spectrometer. SpectrumMill software was used to identify Keap1 peptides 
and  cysteine  modifications.  The  percentage  of  peptides  containing  a  modification  on  Cys151  corresponding  to  the 
molecular weight of MEF was determined and is graphed on the Y-axis. Box-whisker plots demonstrate the means, 
quartiles, and max-min of quadruplicate determinations from two separate studies. 
3.)  The mixture of calcium, magnesium, and zinc salts of MEF concentration-dependently induces Nrf2-
related gene expression in human astrocytes in vitro. 
The transcriptional profiles obtained for the mixture of MEF salts differed for the individual genes: 
at  a  concentration  of  >3 µg/ml,  the  thioredoxin  reductase 1  (Trxnd 1)  response  plateaued,  while 
the slope (degree of relative increase) of NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) and sulfiredoxin 
1 (Srxn1) responses decreased (Figure 3). In contrast, responses for haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), 
oxidative  stress-induced  growth  inhibitor 1  (Osgin 1)  and  glutamate-cysteine  ligase  catalytic 
subunit (Gclc) exhibited a linear increase across the entire concentration range. These differential 
gene responses suggest that additional regulatory processes also govern expression or stability of 
these transcripts. Moreover, the pharmacological activity of the MEF salts appears to reside within 
the FAE as FA itself did not produce a response.

4.)  The mixture of calcium, magnesium, and zinc salts of MEF modulated tissue-specific gene expression 
in vivo. 
Transcriptional profiling revealed that the MEF salts significantly modified transcript levels in blood 
and all examined tissues of mice (brain, inguinal lymph node (ILN), mesenteric lymph node (MLN), 
kidney,  jejunum  and  spleen)  with  the  most  prominent  response  in  the  kidney  (Figure 4).  MEF 
exposure in plasma and tissues was verified in a separate cohorts of animals.

Figure 7: The mixture of MEF salts significantly modulates tissue-specific transcription 
C57Bl/6 mice received single or repeated oral doses of 79.2 mg/kg MEF salts for 10 days (equivalent to 100 mg/kg 
DMF).  Fumaric  acid  was  not  tested  due  to  its  lack  of  activity  in  previous  investigations  in vitro  (see  above). 
Transcriptional responses were evaluated by Affymetrix microarrays at 6 and 12 h after a single dose, and 12 h after 
the last dose following 10 consecutive days of once daily dosing (multiple dosing = MD). 
Most  recently,  gene  expression  profiles  were  reported  following  repeated  oral  administration  of 
100 mg/kg DMF, a total dose of 79 mg/kg of the calcium, magnesium and zinc salt mixture of MEF or 
the DMF/MEF combination for 10 days in mice (Wipke et al., 2021). The analyses were performed 12 h 
after  the  final  dose  and  used  Affymetrix  microarray  analyses  that  included  tissues  with  preferential 
distribution of MMF and MEF (Figure 6). The expression of 487 genes was specifically altered in response 
to  DMF  treatment,  which  comprise  the  known  Nrf2-mediated  oxidative  stress  response,  glutathione 
(GSH)-mediated  detoxification  and  others  (Figure 5A).  These  DMF-induced  changes  were  particularly 
evident in mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, spleen and whole blood. For MEF, 224 gene expression 
changes  were  specifically  noted  that  predominated  in  kidney  and  mesenteric  lymph  node.  The  MMF 
altered transcripts corresponded to apoptosis, death receptor and autophagy-related pathways. 
Following dosing of the DMF/MEF combination, 132 genes demonstrated a significant interaction effect 
between DMF and MEF, which was most pronounced in immunological tissues, like whole blood, spleen, 
mesenteric and inguinal lymph node (Figure 5B).

Gene  expression  profiles  were  determined  by  Affymetrix  microarrays  from  tissues  with  preferential  distribution  of 
MMF and MEF at 12 h after the final repeated oral dose of either 100 mg/kg DMF, a total dose of 79 mg/kg of the 
calcium, magnesium and zinc salt mixture of MEF (ratio of 91.5 % : 5.2 % : 3.2 %) or the DMF/MEF combination for 
10  days  in  mice.  (A)  Hierarchical  clustering  reveals  487 DMF-specific  and  the  224 MEF-specific  probe  sets  after 
normalization (n = 7 biological sample sets each). DMF specificity is most pronounced in MLN, ILN, spleen, and whole 
blood,  whereas  MEF  specificity  is  most  evident  in  the  kidney  and  MLN.  (B)  Hierarchical  clustering  shows 
132 interaction probe sets, which is most pronounced in immunologic tissues: whole blood, MLN, ILN, and spleen.

Evaluation comment  
A sparse set of non-clinical data is provided for a comparison of the pharmacological effect of MEF in 
contrast to either DMF or fixed combination of MEF/DMF. Some of the comparative studies shows that in 
vitro the individual MEF salts, the free acid of MEF, DMF and MMF similarly increase Nrf2 concentrations 
as  analysed  by  Western  blotting,  whereas  FA  was  ineffective.  Perhaps,  the  most  relevant  study  for 
purpose of the comparison between DMF, MEF and their combination was recently published (Wipke et 
CHMP Assessment Report

al., 2021). Gene expression profiles were reported following repeated oral administration of 100 mg/kg 
DMF, a total dose of 79 mg/kg of the calcium, magnesium and zinc salt mixture of MEF or the DMF/MEF 
combination for 10 days in mice. The expression of 487 genes was specifically altered in response to 
DMF treatment, which comprise the known Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, glutathione (GSH)-
mediated detoxification and others. These DMF-induced changes were particularly evident in mesenteric 
and  inguinal  lymph  nodes,  spleen  and  whole  blood.  For  MEF,  224  gene  expression  changes  were 
specifically noted that predominated in kidney and mesenteric lymph node. The MMF altered transcripts 
corresponded  to  apoptosis,  death  receptor  and  autophagy-related  pathways.  Following  dosing  of  the 
DMF/MEF combination, 132 genes demonstrated a significant interaction effect between DMF and MEF, 
which was most pronounced in immunological tissues, like whole blood, spleen, mesenteric and inguinal 
lymph node 
In addition to this data, the mixture of calcium, magnesium and zinc salts of MEF covalently modifies 
Keap1 at Cys151 in vitro. The same modification of Keap 1 at Cys151 had been previously demonstrated 
for  DMF  and  MMF.  As  known  for  DMF,  MEF  is,  hence,  able  to  release  Nrf2  from  constitutive  Keap  1 
repression.   
Exploratory  studies  provided  for  MEF  can  be  considered  as  supportive  for  proof  of  concept  in  the 
indication of psoriasis. While a straightforward additive or synergistic effect of MEF in the combination 
cannot be concluded due to the limitations of the conducted non-clinical studies.  
Pharmacokinetic properties of DMF and MEF 
In pharmacokinetic (PK) investigations conducted in rats and dogs submitted during the MA of Tecfidera, 
DMF was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted pre-systemically to its active 
metabolite MMF. Quick absorption was also confirmed for MEF in these species. MMF was found to be 
further metabolised to fumaric acid, citric acid and glucose indicating initial DMF metabolism by esterases 
followed by the citric acid cycle. Accordingly, DMF was found to be predominantly eliminated as exhaled 
CO2 (~60-65 %). About 21 % of the administered DMF dose was determined in urine, with cysteine and 
N-acetyl  cysteine  conjugates  of  mono-  and  dimethyl  succinate  as  major  urinary  metabolites.  MMF 
represented  only  up  to  1.7 %  of  urinary  metabolites,  whereas  the  amount  of  unchanged  DMF  was 
negligible (< 0.2 %). The contribution of the faecal route to the elimination of DMF was small (≤ 4.4 %). 
In addition, metabolism data obtained in rat and human hepatocyte suspensions indicated formation of 
glutathione (GSH) conjugates of DMF and MMF and a low amount of other minor metabolites excluding 
MEF. Analyses using liver microsomes or hepatocytes from rats and humans further confirmed that MEF 
does not convert to either DMF or MMF, and DMF or MMF are not transformed into MEF. In agreement 
with this finding, no MEF  was detected in plasma or tissues of mice after oral administration of DMF, 
and, conversely, no DMF or MMF was identified in mice after oral administration of MEF. Thus, DMF and 
MEF are not metabolites of each other in vivo. 
A recent publication reports the distribution of MMF and MEF after oral administration of either 100 mg/kg 
DMF or as total dose 79 mg/kg of the mixture of calcium, magnesium and zinc salts of MEF to mice and 
rats (Wipke et al., 2021). MMF widely distributed in both species and reached higher concentrations in 
brain  and  spleen  than  MEF  (Figure 6).  In  contrast,  MEF  preferentially  distributed  into  the  kidney. 
Accordingly, the brain to plasma ratio is higher for MMF compared to MEF, while MEF demonstrates a 
higher kidney to plasma ratio than MMF. These data are in line with the higher excretion of intact MEF 
compared to MMF in rats (9-fold) and in Cynomolgus monkeys (26-fold; Wipke et al., 2021).

C57Bl/6 mice (A, C) or Sprague-Dawley rats (B, D), plasma and tissue levels (brain, spleen, jejunum, kidney, and 
liver)  of  MMF  and MEF were determined  30 min post dose.  The  relative  tissue  penetration  in  relation  to plasma  is 
given above each bar. Brain or kidney to plasma ratios of MMF and MEF in mice and rats highlight the significantly 
higher MMF brain exposure vs. MEF (E), whereas MEF reaches significantly higher levels in kidney than MMF (from 
Wipke et al., 2021).

Evaluation comment  
Overall, the provided in vitro and in vivo PK non-clinical data shows that DMF and MEF are two different 
(to some extent) active moieties which share a similar metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 
fumaric acid (an inactive moiety). DMF and MEF are not metabolites of each other in vivo. In addition, 
in  vitro  data  using  liver  microsomes  or  hepatocytes  from  rats  and  humans  shows  that  MEF  does  not 
convert to either DMF or MMF, and DMF or MMF are not transformed into MEF. In the in vivo (mice and 
rats) study, MMF the active metabolite of DMF reached higher concentrations in the brain and spleen 
than MEF. In contrast, MEF is preferentially distributed into the kidney (Wipke et al., 2021).  
Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
The submitted pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic non-clinical data shows that DMF and MEF are 
two active moieties with pharmacological modes of action that are putatively different, but applicable for 
the  indication  of  psoriasis.  Nevertheless  a  straightforward  additive  or  synergistic  effect  of  MEF  in  the 
combination cannot be concluded due to the limitations of the conducted non-clinical studies.  
2.2.2.  Clinical aspects 
•  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacological properties of DMF and the MEF salts 
DMF and MEF are different esters of fumaric acid, which itself is inactive. 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, DMF is not detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases to 
its  active  metabolite  MMF  and/or  interacts  with  GSH  to  form  conjugates  (Skilarence,  EPAR).  MMF  is 
further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). Likewise, MEF is metabolized by esterases to FA (Rostami-Yazdi 
et al., 2010).

Figure 10: Presumptive metabolic pathway of DMF and MEF (Rostami-Yazdi et al., 2010) 
MEF does not convert to either DMF or MMF, and DMF or MMF are not transformed into MEF. Thus, DMF 
and MEF are not metabolites of each other in vivo. 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
DMF, MMF and MEF are pharmacologically active 
The main activity of DMF and MMF is considered to be immunomodulatory, resulting in a shift in T helper 
cells (Th) from the Th1 and Th17 profile to a Th2 phenotype and thus reducing inflammatory cytokine 
production with the induction of pro-apoptotic events, inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation, reduced 
expression of adhesion molecules, and diminished inflammatory infiltrate within psoriatic plaques. 
In in vitro and in vivo studies MEF salts have been shown to: reduce IL-6 and TGF-alpha secretion in the 
psoriatic cocultures of KCs and T cells, suppress lymphocyte proliferation, induce early apoptotic effects 
on lympho-histiocytic cells and induce a rapid, transient Ca2+ increase in KCs and inhibit KC proliferation.  
The mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is not fully 
understood. Preclinical studies indicate that dimethyl fumarate pharmacodynamic (PD) responses appear 
to  be  primarily  mediated  through  activation  of  the  Nuclear  factor  (erythroid-derived  2)-like  2  (Nrf2) 
transcriptional pathway. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to up regulate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant 
genes in patients (e.g. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1; [NQO1]).  
Effects on the immune system 
In  preclinical  and  clinical  studies,  dimethyl 
fumarate  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunomodulatory properties. Dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate, the primary metabolite 
of  dimethyl  fumarate,  significantly  reduced  immune  cell  activation  and  subsequent  release  of 
proinflammatory cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In clinical studies 
with psoriasis patients, dimethyl fumarate affected lymphocyte phenotypes through a down-regulation 
of  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  profiles  (TH1,  TH17),  and  biased  towards  anti-inflammatory  production

(TH2).  Dimethyl  fumarate  demonstrated  therapeutic  activity  in  multiple  models  of  inflammatory  and 
neuroinflammatory  injury.  In  Phase  3  studies  in  MS  patients,  upon  treatment  with  Tecfidera  mean 
lymphocyte counts decreased on average by approximately 30% of their baseline value over the first 
year with a subsequent plateau (Tecfidera, SmPC). 
•  Clinical Efficacy 
Most of the published clinical efficacy and safety studies in the indication psoriasis refer to Fumaderm 
(DMF/MEF)  or  other  DMF/MEF  combinations.  In  these  studies,  a  therapeutic  effect  of  Fumaderm  ( 
DMF/MEF) in psoriasis has consistently been described (e.g. Altmeyer, 1994, and Gollnick, 2002). Also, 
the  therapeutic  effect  of  DMF  monotherapy  in  psoriasis  has  been  described  in  clinical  studies  (e.g. 
Langner 2004, Mrowietz 2006).  
For  the  purpose  of  assessing  whether  MEF  has  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  contribution  within 
Fumaderm from an efficacy standpoint, the following publications have been reviewed:

Moreover, study by Nieboer et al. (1989), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of MEF-Na is discussed 
below.  
However, the non-randomised study of Kolbach and Nieboer (1992) is not suitable for a comparison, as 
the DMF-treatment group received only half of the DMF-dose in the Fumaderm-group. Moreover, this 
study was not randomized. Nevertheless, a short description of the study is provided below.  
Kolbach and Nieboer, 1992 
Efficacy  and  side  effects  of  treatment  with  either  DMF  monotherapy  or  DMF/MEF  salt  combination  in 
psoriatic patients were investigated over two years. 
Group 1 (n=129) was treated with DMF, capsules filled with 60 mg of semi-enteric-coated. The dosage 
was increased weekly by 60 mg to a maximum of 240 mg DMF/day.  
Group 2 (n=67) was treated with DMF/MEF (enteric-coated (Fumaderm) tablets): (1) "Mite", containing 
30 mg of DMF, 5 mg Mg2+-, 3 mg Zn2+-, and 56 mg Ca2+-salts of MEF; or (2) "Forte", containing 120 mg 
of DMF, 5 mg Mg2+-, 3 mg Zn2+-, and 87 mg Ca2+-salts of MEF. Medication started with one "Mite" tablet 
per day to be increased weekly to three tablets per day. In the fourth week, medication was switched to 
one "Forte" tablet per day and this was increased weekly to a maximum of four tablets per day amounting 
to a maximum of 480 mg DMF + 380 mg MEF salts (i.e. 860 mg fumarate esters/day). 
Results: The percentage of patients that continued the therapy was significantly higher in the DMF/MEF 
combination group than in the DMF group after 6 months. After 24 months, 55 % continued the DMF/MEF 
medication versus 16 % of the DMF users. Sufficient therapeutic results were obtained in approximately 
50 %  of  the  DMF/MEF-treated  patients  during  the  entire  study.  In  the  DMF  group,  the  percentage  of 
sufficient responders declined from 32 to 18 during the 24 months. These differences were statistically 
significant. The most important reason to discontinue the therapy was insufficient efficacy in the DMF 
group (36 %).

The study authors concluded that DMF/MEF combinatorial treatment was significantly superior to DMF 
monotherapy.  
Evaluation comment  
The efficacy and safety of DMF monotherapy in comparison to DMF/MEF salt combination was evaluated 
in  196  patients  with  nummular  or  plaque-type  psoriasis.  Numerical  superiority  of  DMF/MEF  salt 
combination  over  DMF  was  shown  (after  24  months,  55%  of  patients  continued  on  DMF/MEF  salt 
combination therapy, compared to 16% of patients on DMF). Moreover, in the DMF group the percentage 
of sufficient responders declined from 32% to 18% during the 24-month study, while in the DMF/MEF 
salt  combination  group  the  percentage  remained  unchanged.  However,  there  were  significant 
shortcomings in this study, including the fact that the amount of DMF in the DMF/MEF combination was 
twice of the amount of DMF in the monotherapy arm. Therefore, patients in the DMF monotherapy group 
may have been treated with doses which were not sufficient for all patients and it is therefore difficult to 
assess any additive effects of the MEF esters.  
There is no information on demographics and patients’ disease features (e.g. severity of psoriasis, 
disease duration, previous treatment) across the groups. In the absence of randomization or any other 
method to control for baseline unbalance (the article established that the choice of the therapy was 
determined by a patient´s insurance), this is a critical shortcoming that prevents the interpretation on 
causal effects.  
Moreover, mild topical corticosteroid was allowed during the study. However, no further information 
about the topical treatment was provided. No information about statistical analysis was found. Taking 
into consideration the evaluation of psoriasis, usage of topical corticosteroid might have distorted the 
results of the study. There are critical flaws in the study methods and statistical analysis, therefore no 
conclusion can be drawn from this study. 
Furthermore, longer dose titration scheme was used in the DMF/MEF combination group compared to 
DMF group. Finally, differences in formulations (galenical formulation of the DMF/MEF combination and 
semienteric-coated DMF capsules) preclude the comparison of efficacy and safety of both products.   
Overall, it is concluded that this study does not allow a comparison of DMF vs. MEF/DMF. 
Nieboer et al., 1989 
This study contains 6 studies, however, only 2, considering MEF could be considered relevant for this 
AR.  
Study  II:  controlled  study  with  MEFAE  sodium  (Na).  In  a  double-blind  study  240  mg  MEFAE-Na  was 
compared with placebo in 38 patients (22 women and 16 men). The treatment started with one capsule 
of 60 mg MEFAE-Na or placebo a day for a week. The dosage was increased in 3 weeks to a maximum 
of 240 mg. The observation time was 4 months. 
Study  IV:  comparative  study  of  720  mg  MEFAE-Na  compared  with  240  mg  MEFAE-Na.  This  dose- 
finding  study  was  performed  because  the  daily  240  mg  dosage  of  MEFAE  was  ineffective.  It  was 
performed in 20 patients, 12 women and 8 men: 10 had been treated with 240 mg MEFAE and 10 with 
placebo  in  the  previous  4  months.  The  first  group  was  given  720  mg  daily,  the  latter  240  mg.  The 
observation time was 3 months.

schedules (studies I-V) 
Study II: double-blind study with 240 mg MEFAE-Na versus placebo 
There was no difference between the numbers of improved, unimproved, or deteriorated cases in 
both groups. The average final score was the same in both groups, and so were the average final 
scores of each factor. Only the itching score showed a greater drop in the MEFAE-Na group than 
in the placebo group. 
Study IV: comparative study 720 mg versus 240 mg MEFAE-Na 
No difference was seen between the 720 mg versus the 240 mg regimen with regard to the number of 
improved  patients.  The  average  final  scores  of  the  total  groups  and  the  extent  of  the  eruption,  the 
redness and the thickness were the same, but significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between 
the final scores of scaling and itching of both groups. 
Evaluation comment  
No difference between MEF-Na at the dose of 240 mg daily and placebo was observed in Study II. 
Treatment with MEF-Na at the dose of 720mg or 240 mg daily resulted in comparable considerable 
improvements  (>50%  n=3  in  both  groups).  Indeed,  the  same  number  of  patients  showed  an 
improvement > 50% of the global score in both groups.  
While  the  subscores  for  extent  of  the  eruption,  the  redness  and  the  thickness  were  not  different 
between  720  mg  –  and  240  mg  –  treated  patients,  differences  in  favour  of  MEF-NA  at  the  dose  of 
720mg – treated patients were observed in the final scores of scaling and itching in the study. The 
authors claimed these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) and thus could be interpreted 
as  supporting  clinically  relevant  effects  of  MEF-Na.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  average 
psoriasis severity score, established as efficacy endpoint in the section of methods in the article, was 
not different between both groups. Subscores were not presented as endpoints in this study and there 
was no evidence of adjustment for multiplicity. Therefore, the claim on statistical significance on scaling 
and itching scores could not be agreed. The small sample size is an additional limitation of the study.  
Therefore, no conclusions on MEF-Na efficacy in psoriasis can be made based on this study. Moreover, 
no direct comparison to DMF was performed in these studies.

An ad hoc statistical analysis of Nieboer 1989 comparing the 240 mg Na-MEF data of Study IV, the 
720mg MEF data of Study IV and a group including 240mg – and 720mg MEF data to the combined 
placebo  data  of  Studies  II  and  III  was  also  taken  into  account.  The  patients  in  these  groups  were 
categorized as follows:  “responders” who achieve at least 25% improvement, and “non-responders” 
who  achieve  less  improvement  or  deterioration.  The  rate  of  response  between  the  groups  was 
compared using Fisher’s Exact test (FET) or a chi-squared. Additionally, ordered logistic regression was 
applied considering 4 categories (“deteriorated,” to < 25% improvement, to 25 to 50% improvement, 
and to > 50% improvement). In the context of that ad hoc statistical analysis, it was submitted that 
individually  underpowered  studies  (Nieboer  1989)  of  the  effect  of  MEF  in  the  absence  of  DMF 
demonstrates  statistically  significant  efficacy  on  the  improvement  of  a  psoriasis  severity  score 
compared  to  placebo  when  results  are  pooled  to  increase  statistical  power  in  an  ad  hoc  statistical 
analysis.  
While Nieboer 1989 used a global psoriasis score different than the one that is currently considered as 
a  standard  (PASI),  it  should  be  noted  that  in  both  cases  the  response  is  scored  as  a  percentage  of 
improvement with respect to the baseline value. In this regard, a 75% reduction in the PASI score with 
respect to baseline is the current standard of response assessment used for primary endpoints in most 
clinical  trials  of  psoriasis.  Lower  level  of  responses  (e.g.  50%  reduction)  have  also  been  used  as 
endpoints.  However,  responses  below  50%  are  not  considered  as  an  acceptable  demonstration  of 
treatment response. This is in line with the CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medical products 
indicated for the treatment of Psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).   
Nieboer et al., 1990 
The aim of this double-blind, 16 week trial was to  assess the therapeutic effect of DMF monotherapy 
compared to DMF/MEF using the same DMF dosage and, thus, to assess the possible additional effect of 
MEF. 
Treatment  
Group 1 (n=22) received max. 480 mg DMF/day (max. 4 tablets/day of 120 mg each). 
Group  2  (n=23)  received max.  480 mg  DMF/day  +  380 mg  MEF  salts  (max.  4 tablets/day  of  120 mg 
DMF + 87 mg Ca2+-MEF + 5 mg Mg2+-MEF + 3 mg Zn2+-MEF per tablet) for 4 months. 
Patients 
Randomization into two groups was made between 45 patients. 25 female, 20 male. Aged between 18 
and 70 years. 22 were treated with DMFAE-E C. 23 with FAC-EC. At the end of the study 33 patients 
could be evaluated. 18 had been treated with DMFAE-EC and 15 with FAC-EC. At least 10% of the body 
surface was affected. At the beginning of the study 22 of these 33 patients showed the plaque type; 10 
the macular type; and 1 the guttate type of psoriasis. 11 patients had joint complaints, 6 in the DM FAE-
EC group and 5 in the FAC-EC group.  
Results   
The  individual  results  are  shown  in  Table  5.  Compared  to  the  initial  population  score,  a  considerable 
improvement (i.e. score more than halved) was observed in 45% of the patients treated with DMFAE-
EC and in 52% of the treated with FAC-EC. This improvement was statistically significant. 
In both groups 4 patients (18 and 15%) showed a full clearance. Considerable improvement occurred in 
15 out of 22 (68%) patients with the plaque type and in 4 out of 10 (40%) of those with the macular 
type. The patient with the guttate type showed a full clearance after a treatment of 2 months with FAC-
EC,  but  had  an  extensive  relapse  1  month  later  even  though  the  therapy  had  been  continued.  For  5 
patients (22%) in the DMF AE-EC group and 1 patient (4%) in the FAC-EC group the psoriasis did not 
show any reaction to the therapy. The observed differences between the two groups appeared to be not 
significant. Deterioration, that is an increase of the score up to more than 125%, was not observed in 
either of the groups.

The  course  of  the  score  in  both  groups  with  regard  to  the  total  average  score  and  the  separate 
parameters is shown in Figure 8 a, b. It covers the observations of those patients who could be evaluated 
after 4 months: 18 in the DMFA E- EC group and 15 in the FAC-EC group. The total average score in the 
DMFAE-EC group dropped from 9.7 to 4.1 and in the FAC-EC group from 10.5 to 4.1. The course of this 
score in both treatment groups was not significantly different at any time point (1- V). Subsequently, 
the separate parameters, too, did not show a significant difference in time course. The results after 4 
months were not statistically different. 
The joint complaints of the 6 patients in the DMFAE-EC group showed considerable improvement for 2 
patients, and some improvement for 1, and deteriorated or remained unchanged for the other 3. In the 
5 patients in the FAC-EC group a considerable improvement occurred in 2 cases and a slight improvement 
in 3 cases. 
The general evaluation of the therapy by the patients usually corresponded with that of the investigators.

Table 39: Comparative study on the effects of DMFAE-EC (n = 22) and FAC-EC (n = 23) on 45 
psoriasis patients 
Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal side effects (gastralgia, diarrhoea, nausea) were reported for 3 
of the 22 patients of the DMF group and for 7 or the 23 patients treated with the DMF/MEF combination. 
Moreover,  one  patient  of  the  DMF/MEF  combinatorial  group  discontinued  due  to  the  appearance  of 
flushing symptoms, whereas another left the study, because his medication had been stolen.  
In the EPAR for Skilarence, the results of Nieboer et al., 1990, and of the two sub-studies of Nieboer 
et al., 1989 are presented, as it is useful to compare the results of the same author, despite the different 
study designs: 
Table 40: Percentage improvement of PASI after Treatment with DMF or DMF/MEF (Nieboer studies) 
As shown in Table 6, the anti-psoriatic effect, i.e. improvement of PASI with 240 mg DMF monotherapy 
was  less  pronounced  than  with  480 mg  DMF  resp.  480 mg  DMF/MEF,  which  was  administered  in  the 
Nieboer study (1990). This means, the DMF dose applied in the Nieboer 1989 studies (III and IV) was 
quite low (probably too low to achieve convincing results). 
Evaluation comment 
The aim of this double-blind study was to assess the therapeutic effect of DMF monotherapy compared 
to  DMF/MEF  using  the  same  DMF  dosage.  There  was  a  numerical  difference  in  favour  of  DMF/MEF 
compared to DMF monotherapy in regard to the improvement of the psoriasis severity score. However, 
as acknowledged by the authors of the study, the difference is not statistically significant. Higher rate of 
discontinuations were observed in DMF/MEF group compared to DMF group. Overall, the evidence of this 
study is limited due to its small sample size, the short duration of treatment, and the absence of control 
for missing data (table 5 and figure 8 were based on a complete case analysis including 81% of patients 
in the DMFAE-EC [DMF] group and 65% of those in the FAC-EC [DMF/MEF] group). Subscores were not

presented  as  endpoints  in  this  study  so  the  course  of  these  scores  over  time  should  be  regarded  as 
exploratory.  In  this  study,  the  greatest  differences  were  observed  for  redness  and  induration  scores 
while a lower difference and no numerical difference were found for scaling and itching, respectively, as 
opposed to Study II and Study IV previously conducted by these authors (Nieboer et al., 1989). 
Mrowietz et al., 2017  
The objective of the BRIDGE study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of DMF 
(LAS41008), compared with placebo and Fumaderm, in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. 
In  this  Phase  III,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  noninferiority  trial,  patients  were  randomized  to 
receive LAS41008, Fumaderm, or placebo (2:2:1) for 16 weeks, up titrating to a maximum daily DMF 
dose of 720 mg, depending upon individual response. 
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. 
Statistical analysis 
The sample-size calculations were based on PASI 75 response rates of 50% and 10% for LAS41008 and 
placebo, respectively, and ‘clear’/’almost clear’ PGA response rates of 40% for LAS41008 and 10% for 
placebo. For the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm® regarding PASI 75 at week 16, a 
zero difference was assumed and a noninferiority margin of 15% was set. An alpha level of 0.05 was 
defined and a dropout rate of 15% was factored into the calculations. A total of 690 patients (276 per 
active group and 138 in the placebo group) provided a power of > 99% for the two superiorities 
tests of LAS41008 vs. placebo, and 90% for the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm. 
In total, 671 patients were randomized and included in the full analysis set (n = 267, LAS41008; n = 
273, Fumaderm; n = 131, placebo).

At week 16, 33%, 37.4% and 13% of patients had achieved a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in the PGA 
in the LAS41008, Fumaderm and placebo groups, respectively, and LAS41008 was significantly superior 
to placebo (P < 0.001; 99.24% CI 9–31%) (Fig.12). Concomitant intake of potentially nephrotoxic drugs 
(n = 108), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors and/or statins, 
did not have a significant impact on the primary outcome measures or on the safety profile of LAS41008.

Based on the above results, the Authors concluded that the study has demonstrated the efficacy and 
safety of LAS41008 (DMF) for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, showing it to be 
significantly superior to placebo and noninferior to the approved combination of FAEs (Fumaderm). 
Evaluation comment 
The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study was to assess the efficacy and safety of DMF 
compared  with  placebo  and  Fumaderm  (DMF/MEF)  in  adult  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  chronic 
plaque psoriasis. Patients were randomized to receive DMF, Fumaderm, or placebo (2:2:1) for 16 weeks, 
up titrating to a maximum daily DMF dose of 720 mg, depending upon individual response. 
The  coprimary  endpoints were  the  percentage  of  patients  achieving  ≥  75%  improvement  in  Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. In total, 671 patients were randomized and included in the full analysis set.  
Significantly  more  patients  achieved  PASI  75  at  week  16  with  either  DMF  or  Fumaderm  compared  to 
placebo (37.5%, 40.3% and 15.3%, respectively). 33% of patients treated with DMF achieved ‘clear’ or 
‘almost clear’ based on PGA at Week 16, compared with 13.0% receiving placebo and 37.4% receiving 
Fumaderm.  
There was a small numerical difference in favor of Fumaderm in regard to the co-primary endpoints and 
most  of  the  secondary  endpoints.  As  stated  in  the  EPAR  “The  effects  in  regard  to  the  co-primary 
endpoints were numerically slightly lower in the Skilarence group compared to Fumaderm although this 
could  be  due  to  variability,  a  limited  PD  and  the  efficacy  effect  of  MEFs  in  Fumaderm  may  also  be 
contributing to an anti-psoriatic effect”. Therefore, these differences although suggesting an additional 
therapeutic  effect  of  MEF  in  Fumaderm  may  also  appear  due  to  variability  or  a  limited  PD.  More 
importantly,  it  should  be  noted  that  this  study  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  DMF  versus 
placebo and non-inferiority versus DMF/MEF. Consequently, the design of this study does not allow to 
demonstrate superiority of DMF/MEF versus DMF.

This was a prospective observational trial in patients who were treated with the FAE mixture. Patients 
whose psoriasis had improved and who could tolerate treatment with the FAE mixture were recruited. 
Treatment with the FAE mixture was switched to the DMF product without any interruption on the basis 
of the current DMF dose in the FAE mixture. Patients were then scheduled for the next regular check-up 
three months later. To assess psoriasis severity, the PASI index (psoriasis area and severity index) was 
used. When presenting for their first check-up after switching, patients were handed a questionnaire to 
investigate their views about tolerability and efficacy and to provide a global judgment of the switch. 
Results 
A total of 40 patients (24 male, 16 female) were prospectively and consecutively recruited to the study 
and underwent a check-up after switching treatments. The age of adult patients ranged from 18 to 74 
years with a mean age of 46 years. One patient was 13 years old and received treatment off-label.  
Figure 16: Number of patients related to the duration of continuous FAE therapy that they received 
before switching from the FAE mixture to the DMF product (n = 40) 
Most patients were treated with a daily DMF dose between 120 mg and 480 mg and had previously been 
treated with the FAE mixture for one to five years.  
In general, the patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive 
(18 positive, 18 neutral, 4 negative).  
Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 3/37 had a higher PASI 
severity  after  switching  (Figure  14).  A  PASI  estimate  was  not  available  at  one  of  the  visits  in  3/40 
patients.

Figure 17: Clinical course of PASI in patients treated with the FAE mixture before (t1) and after (t2) 
switching to the DMF product. The mean time between the two visits was 91.8 days (minimum 42 
days, maximum 133 days; n = 37) 
The Authors concluded that the results of this study showed that psoriasis patients can switch from the 
traditional  FAE  mixture  to  the  same  dose  of  DMF  with  similar  clinical  relief  but  without  any  washout 
period. 
Evaluation comment  
This prospective study was aimed to investigate the switch from the currently used DMF/MEF to DMF 
monotherapy. The study was not designed to evaluate the treatment difference between DMF/MEF and 
DMF in the treatment of psoriasis.  The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical course of PASI 
in patients after switching to the DMF product.  
Treatment with the DMF/MEF was switched to the DMF product without any interruption. Patients clinical 
state  was  evaluated  after  three  months.  To  assess  psoriasis  severity,  the  PASI  (psoriasis  area  and 
severity index) was used. 
The patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive (18 positive, 
18 neutral, 4 negative). Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 
3/37 had a higher PASI severity after switching.  
However, based on the presented data it is not possible to evaluate in how many patients PASI improved. 
Therefore, it is not possible to conclude on differences in efficacy between the two treatments.  
Discussion on Efficacy 
There are in a total 4 published studies which can be considered the most relevant for the evaluation of 
the clinical relevance of MEF in Fumaderm. However, the results of Kolbach & Nieboer (1992) were not 
included in the analysis due to severe limitations, described above.  
Therefore, the assessment of the clinical relevance of MEF can be based on the results of 3 published 
studies:  
In the Nieboer et al., study (1990), a numerical, but not statistically significant, difference in favour of 
DMF/MEF  compared  to  DMF  monotherapy  (52%  vs.  45%)  was  demonstrated  in  what  regards  the 
improvement of the psoriasis severity score. 
CHMP Assessment Report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 143/152 
 
 
 
 
When  only  patients  who  could  be  evaluated  after  16  weeks  were  included  in  the  analysis,  the 
improvement percentage (i.e. a psoriasis severity score more than halved) was 55 % in the DMF group 
and 80 % in the DMF/MEF group. However, this complete case analysis may be biased. Except for the 
single patient for whom the tables were stolen, all other patients discontinued due to adverse events, 
an intercurrent event, likely informative that was completely disregarded by the investigators. Therefore, 
the comparison of 55% - 80% should not be considered a reliable estimate of the difference. Additionally, 
the evidence of this study is limited due to the small sample size and short duration of treatment. 
In Falkvoll et al. (2019) study, efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, 
while 3/37 had a higher PASI severity after switching from DMF/MEF combination to DMF. However, it 
was not stated clearly in how many patients PASI improved. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude on 
differences in efficacy between the two treatments.  
The most relevant study for this assessment appears to be study by Mrowietz et al. (2017), which was 
a  pivotal  study  for  the  Skilarence  MAA.  The  study  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  DMF  to 
placebo and non-inferiority to Fumaderm. Although both co-primary endpoints were met, the robustness 
of the demonstration of non-inferiority to Fumaderm was found questionable. As it was discussed in the 
EPAR for Skilarence, although the difference in proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 was -2.8 (99.24 
CI =14.0 8.4; p-0.0003), and the lower limit of the confidence interval was within the prespecified non-
inferiority limit of 15, given the absolute difference in proportion of responders by PASI 75 between DMF 
and placebo was 22%, the non-inferiority margin of 15% could not be appropriate. 
The  comparison  between  DMF  and  Fumaderm  showed  that  Fumaderm  consistently  had  a  numerically 
higher response rate. In FAS population, 37.5% of the patients in the DMF group compared to 40.3% of 
the patients in the Fumaderm group achieved PASI 75 at Week 16. Moreover, the proportion of patients 
achieving PGA clear/almost clear was 33% and 37.4% in DMF and Fumaderm groups, respectively. 
These data suggest that MEF may contribute to the efficacy in psoriasis to some extent. This assumption 
is  supported  by  pharmacodynamic  studies  demonstrating  MEF  salts  biological  activities,  including 
reducing IL-6 and TGF-alpha secretion in psoriatic cocultures of KCs and T cells, suppressing lymphocyte 
proliferation  and  inducing  a  rapid,  transient  [Ca2+]  increase  in  KCs  and  inhibiting  KC  proliferation. 
However, and as stated in the EPAR for Skilarance, “The effects in regard to the co-primary endpoints 
were numerically slightly lower in the Skilarence group compared to Fumaderm although this could be 
due to variability, a limited PD and the efficacy effect of MEFs in Fumaderm may also be contributing to 
an  anti-psoriatic  effect”.  Therefore,  reasons  other  than  an  additional  therapeutic  effect  of  MEF  in 
Fumaderm  could  not  be  excluded.  More  importantly,  the  design  of  this  study  does  not  allow  to 
demonstrate superiority of DMF/MEF versus DMF. 
Overall,  based  on  the  available  data,  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  MEF  in  psoriasis  appear  to  be 
demonstrated. A numerical difference in favour of DMF/MEF combination reported in two independent 
randomized, double blind studies suggests that MEF could contribute to the efficacy of Fumaderm in the 
treatment  of  psoriasis.  However,  given  the  methodological  limitations  of  the  available  clinical  studies 
comparing directly DMF/MEF with DMF monotherapy in patients with psoriasis (small sample size, short 
duration of treatment, absence of methods to account for missing data, intercurrent events and multiple 
comparisons, absence of properly design studies to demonstrate superiority of DMF/MEF over DMF), a 
clinically relevant effect of MEF in Fumaderm has not been demonstrated.

•  Clinical Safety 
For  the  purpose  of  assessing  whether  MEF  has  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  contribution  within 
Fumaderm from a safety standpoint, the following four publications have been reviewed.  
Kolbach and Nieboer, 1992 
In terms of tolerability, side effects were the most frequent reason to stop therapy in the DMF/MEF group 
(18%). For the DMF group, this percentage was 26%. In the first 6 months gastrointestinal complaints 
were the most frequent in both groups. However, the aforementioned difference was not significant and 
although  the  amounts  of  DMF  in  the  DMF/MEF  combination  group  were  twice  that  of  the  DMF 
monotherapy, this is no sound proof that the MEF increased the tolerability. 
Comparable to the studies from Nieboer et al. 1989, DMF in the DMF-monotherapy group was formulated 
as  capsules  filled  with  semi-enteric-coated  granulate,  whereas  Fumaderm  was  formulated  as  enteric-
coated tablets, which could have resulted in different drug release and hence affected the safety profile. 
Evaluation comment  
Although the amounts of DMF in the DMF/MEF combination were twice that of the DMF monotherapy, 
slightly  higher  discontinuation  rate  was  reported  in  patients  from  DMF  group  compared  to  DMF/MEF 
group (16% vs 18%). However, it should be noted that differences in both formulations (semi-enteric 
coated vs enteric coated) could contribute to the overall tolerability.  
Furthermore, taking into consideration different dose of DMF and different pharmaceutical formulation, 
no definite conclusion cannot be drawn from this study.  
Nieboer et al., 1990 
The  subjective  and  objective  side effects  are  shown  in  Table  8. The  flushings  started  3-4  h  after  the 
tablets  were  taken.  They  involved  a  feeling  of  tingling  heat,  accompanied  by  diffuse  redness,  which 
continued for about half an hour mainly localized in the face, arms and the upper part of the body. This 
symptom was not constantly present and in the course of the treatment its frequency decreased. More 
than  half  the  patients  were  troubled  by  serious  stomach  complaints,  involving  gastralgia,  but  also 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For 14% (n = 3) of the patients in the DMFAE-EC group and 30% (n = 
7) in the FAC-EC group these complaints were a reason to discontinue the therapy. The abnormalities 
which were registered in the blood most generally were: leukopenia(< 3.0 x 109/1), lymphopenia (< 
15%) and eosinophilia (> 5%). The former two developed in the course of the 3rd and 4th months. The 
eosinophilia usually began in the first 2 months and disappeared spontaneously in most of the cases.

Evaluation comment  
In  this  study,  higher  discontinuation  rate  due  to  AEs  (nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea)  was  reported  in 
DMF/MEF  group  compared  to  DMF  group  (30%  vs  14%).  However  due  to  small  study  size,  no  clear 
conclusion cannot be made. 
Mrowietz et al., 2017  
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported in 83.9% and 84.1% of patients in the LAS41008 and 
Fumaderm®  groups,  respectively,  and  in  59.9%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  were 
considered  ‘mild’  in  intensity  (66.7%,  67.1%  and  52.6%  in  the  LAS41008,  Fumaderm®  and  placebo 
groups, respectively). The most frequently reported TEAEs in both the LAS41008 (DMF) and Fumaderm® 
groups were gastrointestinal disorders (62.7% and 63.3%, respectively), including diarrhoea, abdominal 
pain,  nausea  and  flatulence.  Flushing  was  also  commonly  reported  (18.3%  and  16.3%,  respectively) 
(Table 9).

Table 43: Adverse events (AEs) reported by ≥ 5% of the patients in any treatment group (safety 
population) 
Lymphopenia was reported in 28 patients (10.0%) in the LAS41008 group, with three patients (1.1%) 
considered severe (< 0.5 x 109 cells L.1), and in 30 (10.6%) patients in the Fumaderm group, with two 
patients (0.07%) considered severe. Proteinuria was reported in four patients (1.4%) in the LAS41008 
group and in six patients (2.1%) in the Fumaderm group. Overall, the frequency and type of the reported 
TEAEs were very similar and did not differ significantly between the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups 
(Table 9). 
Twenty-three  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  22  patients  (3.2%,  2.8%  and  3.6%  of  patients  in  the 
LAS41008, Fumaderm and placebo groups, respectively). Only four of these serious TEAEs, occurring in 
three patients randomized to Fumaderm, were assessed by the investigator as related to 
treatment (erosive gastritis, gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastroduodenitis). 
One  death  considered  unrelated  to  the  medication  was  reported  in  a  patient  receiving  Fumaderm 
(subendocardial ischaemia). No relationship between blood abnormalities and the onset of infections was 
detected. 
Laboratory investigations 
At week 16 or upon early treatment discontinuation, the mean total lymphocyte counts had decreased 
from baseline by 0.52 x109 cells L_1 in both the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups, and by 0.08 x 109 
cells L_1 in the placebo group. 
Similarly, the mean leucocyte counts had decreased from baseline by 0.73 x109 and 0.69 x 109 cells L_1 
in the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups, respectively, compared with 0.04 x 109 cells L_1 in the placebo 
group. Lymphocyte counts below 0.7 x 109 cells L_1 were observed during the trial in 22 patients in the 
LAS41008  group  (7.9%),  21  patients  in  the  Fumaderm  group  (7.4%)  and  one  patient  in  the  placebo 
group (0.7%). Based on the available follow-up data, white blood cell counts progressively recovered 
after treatment with either LAS41008 or Fumaderm was stopped.

Evaluation comment  
The safety profile was evaluated based on data of 699 patients. Comparable frequency of adverse 
events was observed in DMF and Fumaderm groups. Most of adverse events were considered mild in 
severity. Lymphopenia was reported in 10% of patients treated with DMF and 10.6% of patients from 
Fumaderm group.  
Falkvoll S et al. 2019  
The majority of patients (27/40) did not experience any difference in GI complaints after switching from 
the  FAE  mixture  to  the  DMF  product.  Gastrointestinal  tolerability  was  judged  as  better  for  the  DMF 
product by 7/40 patients and worse by 2/40 patients. No GI complaints were reported with either drug 
product by 4/40 patients. Flushing was unchanged in 24/40 patients, 8/40 reported less flushing and 
6/40 reported more flushing. Flushing did not occur with either drug product in 2/40 patients. Regarding 
the  question  of  overall  tolerability,  28/40  patients  reported  similar  tolerability,  8/40  reported  better 
tolerability with the DMF product and 4/40 said that tolerability was worse after switching. In answer to 
the question about skin status in general, 27/40 patients reported that it was unchanged after switching 
from the FAE mixture to the DMF product, patients, 7/40 reported that it was better and 6/40 said it was 
worse.  
Evaluation comment  
Overall,  no  significant  differences  in  AEs  and  overall  tolerability  were  observed  after  switching  from 
DMF/MEF to DMF. 31/40 and 26/40 patients did not notice differences between DMF and DMF/MEF with 
respect to gastrointestinal symptoms and flushing, respectively.  
Discussion on Safety 
The safety of DMF/MEF combination in comparison to DMF was evaluated in four studies (Kolbach and 
Niebor (1992); Niebor et al., (1990); Mrowietz et al., (2017) and Falkvoll et al., (2019)).  
Although in Kolbach and Niebor (1992) study higher percentage of patients from DMF group discontinued 
the therapy compared to DMF/MEF group (16% vs 18%), differences in both formulations (semi-enteric 
coated vs enteric coated) could contribute to the overall tolerability. Nevertheless, it should be noted 
that the amounts of DMF in the DMF/MEF combination were twice that of the DMF monotherapy.  
Contrary,  in  Niebor  et  al.,  (1990)  study,  30%  from  DMF/MEF  group  and  14%  from  DMF  group 
discontinued the study due to AEs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).  
In Mrowietz et al., (2017) study, frequency of adverse events reported in DMF and Fumaderm groups 
was comparable.  
Similarly,  no  significant  differences  in  AEs  and  overall  tolerability  were  observed  after  switching  from 
DMF/MEF to DMF in Falkvoll et al., (2019) study.  
In summary, no significant differences in the safety profiles of DMF compared to DMF/MEF combination 
were observed in the available studies.  
Unsolicited submission received during the evaluation 
During the assessment of the therapeutic contribution of MEF in Fumaderm, on 8 September 2021, the 
CHMP received an unsolicited submission from a company.  
CHMP Assessment Report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 148/152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The unsolicited submission has been considered by the CHMP and supports its recommendation as 
outlined below (3. Recommendations and next steps). 
3.  Submission  of  additional  scientific  observations  by  an 
interested entity 
On 1 October 2021, an interested entity submitted additional observations to the CHMP in response to 
the Rapporteurs’ preliminary assessment report (“PAR”).  
The additional observations included, in particular, previously unsubmitted information relating to a pre-
clinical study. In support of that information, it has been claimed that the associated study demonstrates 
that MEF is capable of producing an additive, synergistic benefit to DMF in a non-clinical disease model.  
The Rapporteurs reviewed those additional observations including the pre-clinical study. Further to that 
assessment, it was found that these observations were not capable of altering their conclusion that the 
totality of the available data has not established that MEF has a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution 
within Fumaderm. The reasons for this are as follows:  
First, the Rapporteurs reviewed the different elements of evidence, which was listed in support of the 
finding that MEF has a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm. It was noted that 
the  different  elements  of  evidence  put  forward  mainly  reproduced  the  findings  (and  claims)  that  had 
been previously submitted to the CHMP. The only new element of evidence pertained to the non-clinical 
study mEAE-012 (which will be discussed below).  
Second,  the  results  from  the  non-clinical  study  mEAE-012  were  taken  into  account.  These  results 
stemmed  from  an  experiment  conducted  in  an  experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE) 
model, which was designed to compare the impact of treatment with DMF or MEF monotherapy with a 
combination of DMF+MEF on clinical and histopathological characteristics. Of note, neither the literature 
reference nor the study report was provided and as such details of the study are not available. 
However, a number of shortcomings were identified in relation to the usefulness of this pre-clinical 
study.  
The interested entity has neither provided a study protocol nor a statistical analysis plan. In the absence 
of  this  information,  it  is  unclear  whether  this  is  a  therapeutic  non-clinical  exploratory  study  or  a 
therapeutic non-clinical confirmatory study.  
However, the definitions of the primary and secondary endpoints for this study have not been provided.  
Additionally, no information has been provided about how the entity addressed the inflation of the type 
I error rate as a result of multiple testing (multiplicity). In absence of a pre-specification of a primary 
endpoint and information on control of multiplicity, a conclusion on statistically significant effect cannot 
be reached and the statistically significant claims submitted for the aforementioned differences cannot 
be accepted.   
Altogether considered, these results are considered exploratory and difficult to interpret. Consequently, 
clear conclusions could not be made based on the presented histopathological examination results.  
Moreover, it is not clear how the doses used in mice correspond to the doses used in humans.  
In  conclusion,  although  the  available  non-clinical  data  could  suggest  a  different  impact  of  DMF+MEF 
combination  on  progression  of  EAE  in  mice,  compared  to  DMF  monotherapy,  taking  into  account  the 
CHMP Assessment Report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 149/152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presented results and the above-described limitations, this data cannot be relied upon to establish the 
non-clinical efficacy of MEF within Fumaderm.  
Without prejudice to the above, it also bears noting that, while it is true that (an) active substance(s) 
within a fixed combination medicinal product may have additive or synergistic effects, it is expected that 
clinical data is presented for the purpose of establishing its contribution to the overall effect in terms of 
efficacy.  In  particular,  compelling  mechanistic  (in  vitro  data),  preclinical  and  pharmacodynamic  data 
could be adduced to support a claim of improved efficacy within the fixed combination medicinal product. 
That being so, improved efficacy over (an) individual active substance(s) that have established efficacy 
in the targeted indication (namely, DMF) needs to be shown. The design of the pivotal clinical studies 
should be according to specific clinical guidance, where placebo or standard of care – instead of those 
individual active substances - may be acceptable as comparators. A direct comparison against individual 
active substances with established efficacy in the targeted indication would however still be expected. 
More specifically, for the treatment of psoriasis, a three-armed, parallel-group studies with the active 
agent, placebo and comparative active treatment would be expected. Although the BRIDGE Study did 
take into account DMF, DMF+MEF and placebo, improved efficacy over DMF was not demonstrated.  
The relevance of these non-clinical findings (either alone or in combination with the other elements of 
evidence presented) is limited in the context of the overall assessment, as these findings (account being 
taken of their above-outlined shortcomings) cannot suffice to establish the clinically relevant therapeutic 
contribution of MEF in the combination treatment. In that regard, the claim that MEF has an additive, 
synergistic effect within Fumaderm has not been demonstrated.  
In light of all of the above and having taken into account all the available evidence (including the above-
described  non-clinical  study),  the  additional  observations  submitted  have  not  demonstrated  that  MEF 
has  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  contribution  within  Fumaderm  and  the  Rapporteurs’  conclusion 
remains unchanged.    
4.  Recommendations and next steps 
The CHMP reviewed all above-mentioned studies and data. The CHMP also considered all data submitted 
by the interested entities, including the data submitted by a company on 8 September 2021.  
The available non-clinical data even if not extensive is not scarce and it suggests a potential PD effect 
and PK differences.  
The  available  clinical  data  is  not  conclusive  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  that  MEF  has  a  clinically 
relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm. Whilst said clinical data, including two clinical trials 
(Nieboer et al., 1990 and Mrowietz et al, 2017) showing numerical differences in favour of the DMF/MEF 
combination  vs.  DMF  alone  in  psoriasis,  may  be  indicative  that  MEF  contributes  to  the  efficacy  of 
Fumaderm in the treatment of psoriasis to a small extent, this would need to be confirmed by appropriate 
data that demonstrate a clinically relevant therapeutic effect. In that respect, the evaluated data suffer, 
in part, from severe methodological limitations, including: 
-  Differences in DMF doses administered and differences in formulations (Kolbach and Nieboer, 1992); 
-  Small sample size and short duration (Nieboer, 1989; Nieboer, 1990); 
- 
- 
Lack  of  appropriate  methods  to  account  for  missing  data,  intercurrent  events  and  control  for 
multiplicity (Nieboer, 1989 and Nieboer, 1990); and 
Lack of properly designed studies to demonstrate superiority of DMF/MEF over DMF (Kolbach and 
Nieboer, 1992; Mrowietz et al., 2017; Falkvoll S et al., 2019). 
CHMP Assessment Report  
EMA/CHMP/260961/2022  
Page 150/152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taking into account the described results, including the severe methodological limitations of the clinical 
studies, it cannot be concluded based on these data that a clinically relevant therapeutic effect of MEF 
in Fumaderm has been demonstrated. 
Therefore, the CHMP concludes that the totality of the available data cannot establish that MEF exerts a 
clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm.  
Further to the above, the Rapporteurs recommend adoption of the opinion.

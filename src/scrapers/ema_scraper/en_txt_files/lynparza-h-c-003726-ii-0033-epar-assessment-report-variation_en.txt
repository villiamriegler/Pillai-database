2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas (ICD-9, 2014). More than 80% of exocrine 
pancreatic cancers are infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas, a majority of which exhibit KRAS 
mutations, predominantly G12V or G12D mutations (Seufferlein, et al, 2012), and the remaining types 
include adenosquamous carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, acinar cell 
carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas with giant cells, and solid 
pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. Exocrine pancreatic tumors are far more common than 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which make up about 3-5% of all pancreatic malignancies 
(Krampitz, 2013). Hereditary conditions account for ~5-10% of pancreatic cancer (Seufferlein et al., 
2012). 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Pancreatic cancer was the thirteenth most frequent cancer worldwide with an estimated 458,918 new 
cases diagnosed in 2018 (Globocan 2018).  Globally, age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000 
per year) were lowest in Africa (2.2) and highest in Europe (7.7) and North America (7.6) (Globocan 
2018).  In the US in 2019, pancreatic cancer is estimated to be the ninth most common newly 
diagnosed cancer (56,770 new cases) (American Cancer Society 2019, Siegel et al 2018).  In Europe in 
2018, pancreatic cancer was estimated to be the ninth most common newly diagnosed cancer 
(132,559 new cases) (Globocan 2018).  Current trends show increasing incidence in the US and 
Europe, particularly for younger adults (Wu et al 2018, Rawla et al 2019).  At least 50% of newly 
diagnosed pancreatic tumours are staged as metastatic (SEER Cancer Fact Sheet).  
Due to the very poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer with nearly as many deaths as new cases 
annually, the disease prevalence is low (Bray et al 2018).  The estimated 5-year prevalence of 
pancreatic cancer in 2018 was 282,574 worldwide, with 32,692 prevalent cases in the US and 79,268 
cases in Europe (Globocan 2018). 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 10/147 
 
 
  
 
 
With a life expectancy of 
5% at 5 years, the prognosis of this cancer has not improved over the past 
20 years, and incidence and mortality rates are very similar. Death due to pancreatic carcinoma is 
∼
increasing in Europe. It usually arises in elderly patients with a mean age at onset of 71 years for men 
and 75 years for women. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer progress to either metastatic 
or locally advanced disease in the asymptomatic phase. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment 
with a 5-year survival rate (after resection) of 
20%, but it is only possible in 15%–20% of the 
patients. 
∼
The opportunity to detect pancreatic cancer, while it remains curable, depends on the ability to identify 
and screen high-risk populations before their symptoms arise. Defining the treatment strategy for 
patients suffering from pancreatic carcinoma requires a specialised multidisciplinary team that 
includes: surgeons, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation therapists, radiologists, and 
supportive and palliative care specialists. (Ducreaux et al, 2015, ESMO guidelines) 
The causes of pancreatic cancer are not well understood.  The main risk factors are tobacco, and 
factors related to dietary habits (BMI, red meat intake, low fruit and vegetables intake, diabetes, 
alcohol intake) (Ducreaux et al, 2015, ESMO guidelines) and Helicobacter pylori infection (Maisonneuve 
et al 2015, Rawla et al 2019).  Additional potential risk factors include obesity, diabetes, non-O blood 
type, exposure to chemicals, chronic pancreatitis, and genetic predisposition, including BRCA germline 
mutations (Iqbal et al 2012, Maisonneuve et al 2015, Rawla et al 2019).  BRCA mutated cancer is 
more common among patients with a personal history of cancer or family history of several cancers, 
including pancreatic, or those of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (Bannon et al 2018; Chaffee et al 2018, 
Holter et al 2015).  
Although carriers of loss of function germline mutations of the BRCA1 and particularly BRCA2 gene are 
known to have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer (Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 
1999, Goggins et al 1996), the prevalence of gBRCA mutations in the unselected cases of pancreatic 
cancer is unclear.  Holter et al recently reported on a prospective analysis of the prevalence of 
gBRCA1/2 mutations in a cohort of 306 unselected patients with incident pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnoses and identified gBRCA mutations in ~5% of patients (Holter et al 
2015).  Furthermore, Shindo et al recently identified BRCA mutations in 1.8% of patients in a cohort of 
854 patients with PDAC (Shindo et al 2017) and Blair et al identified BRCA mutations in 3.3% of 
patients in a cohort of 658 patients with resected sporadic PDAC (Blair et al 2018).  There are specific 
populations, however, where the association is much stronger.  In Ashkenazi Jewish patients with 
pancreatic cancer, the prevalence of gBRCA mutations is 6% to 10% in unselected patients (Ferrone et 
al 2009, Ozcelik et al 1997) and 15% in patients with a family history of the disease (Kim et al 2012).  
In pancreatic cancer patients with a family history of the disease, prevalence of carrying a germline 
BRCA2 mutation as high as 17% to 19% has been reported (Hahn et al 2003, Murphy et al 2002). 
Pancreatic cancer incidence is higher for men than women and increases with age; the median age at 
diagnosis in the US is 70 years (Ferlay et al 2018, SEER Cancer Fact Sheet).  There is some evidence 
that patients carrying BRCA mutations are diagnosed at a younger age; however, results are not 
consistent (Bannon et al 2018, Holter et al 2015, Hu et al 2018, Toss et al 2019).

Biologic features 
About 95% of pancreatic cancers are adenocarcinomas. Mucinous lesions of the pancreas have 
potential for malignant progression. Multiple combinations of genetic mutations are commonly found in 
pancreatic cancers. The vast majority (>80%) of pancreatic carcinomas are due to sporadically 
occurring mutations. Only a small proportion (<10%) are due to inherited germline mutations.  
Germline mutations in BRCA2, p16, ATM, STK11, PRSS1/PRSS2, SPINK1, PALB2, and DNA mismatch 
repair genes are associated with varying degrees of increased risk for pancreatic carcinoma. 
Familial pancreatic cancers, defined as at least two first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, 
account for only 5%–10% of all pancreatic cancer cases. Mutation in BRCA2 is probably the most 
common inherited disorder in familial pancreatic cancer. 
Other familial syndromes linked to pancreatic cancer are: hereditary pancreatitis, hereditary non-
polyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, ataxia 
telangiectasia, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome and Li–Fraumeni syndrome. 
(Ducreaux et al, 2015, ESMO guidelines). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis <and stage/prognosis>> 
The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer (~90% of patients who are diagnosed will die of the disease) 
is due to late presentation of the disease (locally advanced or metastatic) at the time of diagnosis. 
Early symptoms of pancreatic cancer result from a mass effect. Common presenting symptoms include 
jaundice, pain, weight loss, steatorrhoea. 
Staging of the patient is initially done by CT scan. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is now largely used in 
the staging of adenocarcinoma. 
According to the American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association consensus report, pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (when metastases are absent) is classified as resectable, borderline resectable or 
unresectable. At the time of diagnosis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is deemed resectable in only 
15%–20% of patients. (Ducreaux et al, 2015, ESMO guidelines) 
There is some evidence that prognosis for BRCA mutation carriers is worse compared to those without 
mutations (Blair et al 2018, Ferrone et al 2009). The poor outcomes observed for pancreatic cancer 
are largely due to the late presentation of the disease as optimum screening tests have yet to be 
identified (McGuigan et al 2018). However, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens were associated 
with markedly improved survival in patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations, with survival differences no 
longer appreciated with wild-type patients (Blair et al, 2018; Golan et al, 2017). 
Management 
There are several treatment options available for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer as first 
line therapy, including platinum based chemotherapy. The two preferred regimens for initial treatment 
of metastatic disease include the combination of 5 fluorouracil (5 FU), irinotecan, leucovorin (LV), and 
oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or gemcitabine in combination with nab paclitaxel (Ducreux et al 2015, NCCN 
2019).  Gemcitabine alone or in combination with either capecitabine or erlotinib may also be used in 
the first line treatment setting (Sohal et al 2018). 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 12/147 
 
 
  
 
However, exacerbated toxicities are associated with combination platinum based chemotherapy 
regimens (eg, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and sensory neuropathy; Conroy et al 2011) which generally 
limit the number of cycles of treatment that can be given, meaning chemotherapy cannot generally be 
continued until disease progression. 
Furthermore, few second line regimens are available for the treatment of patients with pancreatic 
cancer (American Cancer Society 2019), and these agents offer modest benefit (Rahma et al 2013).  
In 2015 in the US and 2016 in the EU, liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde™) was approved in combination 
with 5-FU and LV, as second line treatment after progression following gemcitabine-based therapy for 
patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  5-FU/LV plus oxaliplatin may be considered 
as second line treatment under certain circumstances, for patients who received gemcitabine plus nab 
paclitaxel as first line treatment, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status of 0 or 1 and a relatively favourable co morbidity profile (Ducreux et al 2015, Sohal et al 2018). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Olaparib (Lynparza®) is a potent inhibitor of polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) 
which is being developed in a range of tumours as a monotherapy as well as in combination.  PARP 
inhibition targets tumours that have homologous recombination DNA repair pathway deficiencies 
(HRD).   
Lynparza, 50 mg capsule formulation, was approved on 16 December 2014 in monotherapy for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline 
and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who 
are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Subsequently a tablet formulation (100 mg and 150 mg) was approved on 8 May 2018 as 
monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-
grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or 
partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the frame of the type II variations II-20 and II-23, tablet 
formulation was approved for the treatment of patients with breast cancer and first line maintenance 
treatment of the ovarian cancer. 
The aim of this application is to provide the clinical data to support the extension of the Lynparza 
indication to include (initial MAH proposed indication): 
Lynparza (olaparib) is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
germline BRCA1/2 mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas whose disease has not 
progressed following first line platinum-based chemotherapy 
The proposed application is based on data from study D081FC00001 (POLO), a Phase III, randomized, 
double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study of olaparib maintenance treatment (300 mg [2 x 
150 mg tablets] twice daily [bd]) in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with 
gBRCAm (documented germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2) that were loss of function mutations 
(deleterious or suspected deleterious), whose tumours had not progressed following at least 16 weeks 
of first line platinum based chemotherapy.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA covering this extension of indication has been submitted. 
The addition of the pancreatic cancer indication suggests environmental exposure will increase. In line 
with the environmental risk assessment guideline, the MAH submitted an updated ERA. Of note, an 
ERA was previously assessed during the original application for marketing authorisation for olaparib 
and subsequent type II variations and the conclusions remain the same.  
The total PEC value (sum of the PEC for each indication (ovarian (Latvia), breast (Belgium), and 
pancreatic cancers (Hungary)) was recalculated and is still based on a different worst case scenario. 
The highest recent disease prevalences in Europe were taken into account. Published data are 
presented to support these data and the refined Fpen calculations are considered acceptable. This 
worst case scenario total PEC is above the Phase I action limit of 0.01 µg/L as in previous ERA. 
Updated PEC/PNEC ratios are provided and do not raise concerns. 
It is agreed that olaparib is very persistent. However, the Kow value (correct determination) indicates 
a low potential for bioaccumulation. Olaparib is thus not classified as a PBT or vPvB compound. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable. 
An updated ERA covering this extension of indication has been submitted. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of olaparib.  
Considering the above data, olaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new studies have been provided to support this application. 
Platinum sensitivity 
PARP inhibition is an effective option for platinum-sensitive tumors. Non clinical data show that 
sensitivity to platinum agents correlates with sensitivity to olaparib in pancreatic cancer cell lines, as 
well as cell lines derived from other tumor types in which platinum-based chemotherapy is the 
standard of care (Mason et al 2012).   
The effect of BRCA mutations and response to DNA crosslinking agents in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was evaluated by Lowery et al 2011 (Lowery et al 2011),  who reported that 5 
out of 6 BRCA-associated PDAC patients who received a platinum agent as first-line metastatic therapy 
demonstrated a radiographic partial response (PR) or radiographic complete response (CR).  In a small 
retrospective study in BRCAm patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a superior OS was observed 
for patients with Stage III/IV treated with platinum versus those treated with non platinum 
chemotherapies (22 months vs 9 months; p=0.039) (Golan et al 2014). Treatment of 23 patients with 
germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations and PDAC with gemcitabine-cisplatin combination resulted in 
65.2% response rate (O’Reilly et al, 2020). 
Patients randomised in POLO trial has received a prior platinum-containing regimen. There is no 
established criteria to define platinum-sensitive disease or associated platinum-free interval. 
Germline BRCA1/2 testing and concordance 
Only germline testing has been conducted. Tumour BRCA testing has not been performed. 
Central germline BRCA1/2 testing and concordance with local germline testing 
The entry criteria for patients in POLO included the requirement to have a loss of function gBRCA1 or 
gBRCA2 mutation, determined prior to study entry from an existing local gBRCA test (51 patients, of 
which 48 patients have been randomised) or from prospective testing using either the Myriad 
BRACAnalysis® CLIA test (216 patients tested, of which 13 patients have been randomised as 
gBRCAm, 5 patients had VUS and 197 patients were gBRCAwt) or the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx® test 
(2978 patients tested of which 100 patients have been randomised with gBRCAm, 73 patients had 
VUS, 2702 patients were gBRCAwt and two inconclusive interpretation).   
Patients randomised on to POLO using a local gBRCA result were retested post randomisation prior to 
database lock with either the Myriad BRACAnalysis® or the BRACAnalysis CDx® test where possible. 
Out of 154 randomised patients, 150 had a sample available to test using a Myriad gBRCA test. Fifty-
one patients had a local BRCA result. Out of those 51 patients, blood sample was available and could 
be tested in 44 out of 48 patients retested by Myriad gBRCA test.

Figure 1: Summary of concordance analysis between test results and Myriad gBRCA test results in 
POLO 
The concordance between the local BRCA test and the Myriad gBRCA for classification concordance was 
93.0%. The observed classification discordance was limited to the classification of mutants to be 
Suspected Deleterious or Deleterious mutations, which were both eligible for the POLO study.  
Within the 150 patients who were randomised, and tested by Myriad (106 prospectively and 44 
retrospectively) the following mutations were reported 
- 147(98.0%) carried a Deleterious mutation 
- 1 (0.7%) carried 2 Deleterious mutations 
- 2 (1.3%) carried a Suspected Deleterious mutation

The Myriad gBRCAm subset represents cases who were confirmed as carrying a loss of function 
(deleterious or suspected deleterious) mutation in either gBRCA1 or gBRCA2 by the Myriad 
BRACAnalysis® or BRACAnalysis CDx® tests. Efficacy results are summarised in the relevant section. 
Patients who were either not confirmed as carrying a loss of function (deleterious or suspected 
deleterious) mutation by the Myriad BRACAnalysis® or BRACAnalysis CDx® tests, or who could not be 
tested by these tests were excluded from the Myriad gBRCAm subset. 
Study 42 relied on prior local gBRCA testing to guide eligibility, as recorded on the case report forms 
[CRFs] at the time of enrolment to the study.  The gBRCA status of pancreatic patients was not 
reconfirmed centrally with the Myriad gBRCA test. 
The results of exploratory analysis of tumour samples have been provided from two subsets: FMI 
analysis (47 samples) and HLI analysis (140 samples). The results for sBRCAm detection are not 
consistent between two analyses and the proposed rate of 2% of sBRCAm cannot be confirmed at this 
point. It is noticed that ATM mutations occur concomitantly with gBRCAm mutations with reported 
frequency of about 5 – 6%.  
For patients enrolled in POLO study, tumour sample sequencing data from the above exploratory 
analysis have been available only for 8 patients precluding meaningful analysis of HRD biomarkers. 
Therefore, the MAH is recommended to further investigate tissue biomarkers to better define patients 
with likelihood to derive a benefit from treatment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data were submitted as part of this application. The current clinical 
pharmacology package provides sufficient characterisation of the key pharmacokinetics characteristics 
of olaparib. When combined with in vitro drug metabolism and PK profiling data and in vivo DDI 
studies, it provides sufficient data supporting adequate information for special populations and DDI in 
the product information.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, there is in general sufficient information available on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of olaparib tablets to support the use in the applied indication.  
The MAH is recommended to further investigate tissue biomarkers to better define patients with 
likelihood to derive a benefit from treatment.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dose of olaparib in POLO (300 mg bd tablets) was selected based on data from the Phase I study, 
D0810C00024 (Study 24) in an advanced gBRCA mutated ovarian cancer population. Study 24 was a 
formulation  comparison  study  and  the  findings  provided  information  on  the  efficacy,  pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic, safety and tolerability profiles of the olaparib tablet (EPAR Lynparza-H-C-3726-
X-16-G. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study D081FC00001 (POLO): A Phase III, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicentre 
Study of Maintenance Olaparib Monotherapy in Patients with gBRCA Mutated Metastatic  Pancreatic 
Cancer whose Disease Has Not Progressed on First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy. 
Methods 
This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to  assess  the 
efficacy  of  olaparib  maintenance  monotherapy  in  metastatic  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma  patients  with 
gBRCA mutations (documented mutation in gBRCA1 or gBRCA2) that were predicted to be deleterious or 
suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function) whose disease had 
not progressed after receiving a minimum of 16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.  There 
was no upper limit to the duration of chemotherapy that a patient had received. 
Patients  have  been  selected  based  on  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  reported  below  and  were  to  be 
randomised  within  6  weeks  after  their  last  dose  of  chemotherapy  (last  dose  was  the  day of the  last 
infusion) and treatment started as soon as possible but no less than 4 weeks and no more than 8 weeks 
after the last chemotherapy dose.  At the time of starting study treatment, all previous chemotherapy 
treatment was to be discontinued. 
Patients were to continue to receive study treatment until objective radiological disease progression 
as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) as assessed by the investigator and 
as long as in the investigator’s opinion they were benefiting  from treatment and did not meet any 
other discontinuation criteria. Crossover to olaparib was not permitted within the design of the study 
but patients were able to access PARP inhibitors outside of the study and subsequent PARP inhibitor 
use was documented. 
The primary endpoint assessment of PFS was based on BICR of objective radiological findings as per the 
modified RECIST guidelines.  For medical decisions, progression was based on investigator assessment. 
A  number  of  secondary endpoints  were  selected  to  provide  further  support  for  the  clinical  benefit  of

olaparib in this patient population, and included OS, PFS2 (as assessed by the investigator) and patient 
reported outcome (PRO) measures. 
The primary analysis of the study was planned to occur when approximately 87 progression events had 
occurred.  The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  a  BICR  of  disease  progression  by  modified  RECIST; 
however, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the investigator-recorded assessment. All efficacy 
variables  including  OS  were  analysed  at  the  time  of  the  primary analysis  (providing  sufficient  events 
were available to make the analyses meaningful).

Primary outcome variable 
Progression free survival 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological 
disease  progression  according  to  modified  RECIST  or  death  (by  any  cause  in  the  absence  of  disease 
progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomised therapy or receives another 
anticancer therapy prior to disease progression (i.e. date of RECIST progression/death or censoring – 
date  of  randomisation  +  1).    Patients  who  have  not  progressed  or  died  at  the  time  of  analysis  were 
censored  at  the  time  of  the  latest  date  of  assessment  from  their  last  evaluable  RECIST  assessment.  
However, if the patient progressed or died after two or more missed visits, the patient were censored at 
the time of the latest evaluable RECIST assessment (prior to the missing visits). 
Main secondary outcome variables 
Overall survival 
Overall Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause 
(i.e. date of death or censoring – date of randomisation + 1). Any patient not known to have died at the 
time of analysis was supposed to be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was 
known to be alive.  
Time from randomisation to second progression 
The time from randomisation to second progression (PFS2) was defined as the time from the date of 
randomisation to the earliest of the second progression event as assessed by the investigator or death 
(ie date of PFS2 event or censoring – date of randomisation + 1). 
Time to first subsequent therapy or death 
The TFST was defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier of first subsequent cancer therapy 
start  date  following  study  treatment  discontinuation,  or  death  (i.e.  date  of  first  subsequent  cancer 
therapy/death or censoring – date of randomisation + 1). 
Time to second subsequent therapy or death 
The TSST was defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier of the  second subsequent cancer 
therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation, or  death (i.e. date of second subsequent 
cancer therapy/death or censoring – date of randomisation + 1). 
Time to study treatment discontinuation or death 
The  TDT  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomisation  to  the  earlier  of  the  date  of  study  treatment 
discontinuation  or  death  (i.e.  date  of  study  treatment  (olaparib/placebo)  discontinuation/death  or 
censoring – date of randomisation + 1). 
Best objective response  
BoR  was  the  best  response  a  patient  has  had  following  randomisation  but  prior  to  starting  any 
subsequent  cancer  therapy  and  prior  to  RECIST  progression  or  the  last  evaluable  assessment  in  the 
absence of RECIST progression. 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 27/147 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Objective response rate 
For each treatment group, the ORR was the number of patients with a BoR of CR and PR according to 
the  BICR  data  divided  by  the  number  of  patients  in  the  treatment  group  with  measurable  disease  at 
baseline  where  ‘measurable’  is  defined  by  the  BICR  data.  Only  patients  with  measurable  disease  at 
baseline could achieve an objective response of CR or PR. 
Disease control rate 
The DCR was defined as the percentage of patients who had at least one confirmed visit response of CR 
or PR or had demonstrated SD or NED for at least 15 weeks (ie, 16 weeks minus 1 week to allow for an 
early assessment within assessment window) prior to any evidence of progression. 
Patient Reported Outcome Variables 
The EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26, validated PRO questionnaires in the target patient population, will be 
used to evaluate disease symptoms, functional impacts (e.g., physical functioning), and HRQoL and 
characterise clinical benefit from the patient perspective. The EORTC QLQ-C30 / QLQ-PAN26 will be 
scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al 2001) and the draft scoring procedure for 
QLQ-PAN26 (Johnson 2007). 
Sample size 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS. Approximately 145 patients would be randomised (3:2 ratio 
of  olaparib:placebo)  and  the  final  PFS  analysis  was  to  occur  once  approximately  87  PFS  events 
(confirmed  via  a  central  review)  have  occurred.  A  single  interim  PFS  analysis  for  futility  was  to  be 
performed when 50% of the PFS events required for the final analysis (approximately 44 PFS events) 
based on BICR have occurred. 
The study was sized assuming a true treatment effect that was a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 at the 
final  analysis,  assuming  80%  power  and  2.5%  alpha  (1-sided),  with  3:2  randomisation 
(olaparib:placebo).  Assuming  PFS  was  exponentially  distributed,  a  PFS  HR  of  0.54  equates  to  a  3.4 
month improvement in median PFS over an assumed 4 month median PFS for placebo. 
Patients were to be followed for the final analysis of OS and PFS2 (when approximately 106 death events 
have  occurred).  With  106  OS  events  the  study  had  80%  power  to  show  a  statistically  significant 
difference  in  OS  at  the  1-sided  2.5%  level  if  the  assumed  true  treatment  effect  was  a  HR  0.57;  this 
translated to an approximate 6-month improvement in median OS over an assumed 8 month median 
OS on placebo, assuming OS was exponentially distributed. 
Assuming that the study accrual period was approximately 15 months, 87 PFS events were anticipated 
to be observed approximately 18 to 19 months after the first patient is randomised in the study. It was 
estimated that 44 PFS events would have occurred approximately 13 to 14 months after first patient 
in. It was estimated that 106 deaths would have occurred approximately 31 months after first patient 
in.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web 
Response System in a 3:2 ratio to the treatments as specified below: 
•  Olaparib tablets orally 300 mg bd 
• 
Placebo tablets orally bd 
No stratification factors were included in the randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study and the medication was labelled using a unique Kit ID number, which 
was linked to the randomisation scheme. The active and placebo tablets were identical and presented 
in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the study medication.  
Unblinding was permitted for management of medical emergencies or if considered necessary in order 
to make further treatment decisions for individual patients. 
Statistical methods 
The primary outcome variable was PFS assessed by BICR. The PFS analysis was performed with a DCO 
of 15 January 2019. 
PFS was analysed using a log-rank test for generation of the p-value and using the Breslow approach 
for  handling  ties.  The  HR  and  confidence  interval  (CI)  were  estimated  from  the  U  and  V  statistics 
obtained directly from the LIFETEST model. 
Subgroup analyses of PFS were conducted to assess the consistency of treatment effect across potential 
or expected prognostic factors. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the possible presence of 
evaluation-time, attrition and ascertainment (BICR vs investigator). 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of  overall  survival  (OS),  time  from  randomisation  to  second 
progression  or  death  (PFS2,  as  assessed  by  the  investigator),  time  from  randomisation  to  first 
subsequent therapy or death (TFST), time from randomisation to second subsequent therapy or death 
(TSST) and time from randomisation to study treatment discontinuation or death (TDT) were analysed 
using the same methodology and model as used for the primary analysis of PFS. Best objective response 
(BoR) was also a secondary efficacy endpoint and was calculated based on the overall visit responses 
from each RECIST assessment. BoR was summarised based on the RECIST by BICR criteria using the 
following response categories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), no 
evidence of disease (NED), progressive disease (PD) and not evaluable. Disease control rate (DCR) was 
defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  who  have  at  least  one  visit  response  of  CR  or  PR  or  had 
demonstrated SD or NED for at least 15 weeks. 
The impact of olaparib on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed through an analysis of the 
global health status/quality of life (QoL) gathered from Items 29 and 30 of European Organisation for 
Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  quality  of  life  questionnaire  (QLQ)-C30,  a  questionnaire 
developed to assess general cancer related symptoms, functional impacts (eg, physical functioning) and 
HRQoL. Change from baseline score was the primary analysis of the questionnaire and was analysed 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 29/147 
 
 
  
 
using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis of all of the post-baseline scores each visit. 
In order to describe the nature of the benefits of olaparib maintenance treatment, a multiple testing 
procedure was also employed across the primary endpoint (PFS) and the secondary endpoint of OS. All 
other variables (PFS2, TFST, TSST, TDT and HRQoL) were tested at a 2-sided significance level of 5% 
but not adjusted for multiplicity; thus, p-values are treated as nominal. 
The impact of olaparib on HRQoL was repeated as an exploratory analysis for selected EORTC QLQ-C30 
functional  and  symptom  scales  as  well  as  for  selected  EORTC  QLQ-PAN26  scales  (a  questionnaire 
developed  specifically  to  assess  pancreatic  cancer-specific  symptoms  [eg,  pancreatic  pain]  and  their 
impact). Descriptive statistics including change from baseline, arithmetic mean (±standard deviation) 
plots of scores over time, adjusted mean change from baseline (95% CI) over time (summary tables 
and  plots)  and  frequency  tables  of  best  overall  quality  of  life  (QoL)  response  were  presented  by 
treatment group. In addition an exploratory analysis of the EuroQoL five dimensions, five level (EQ-5D-
5L) index which comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort 
and  anxiety/depression)  was  conducted.  Descriptive  statistics,  graphs  and  listings  were  reported  for 
health  state  utility  values  and  visual  analogue  scale  by  visit  as  well  as  change  in  these  scores  from 
baseline, and was summarised by treatment group. 
Sensitivity analyses 
As a sensitivity analysis to the primary endpoint of PFS, the primary analysis was repeated excluding 
patients who did not have a gBRCA mutation status confirmed by the central Myriad test.  The same 
methodology and model as used for the primary analysis was applied and the HR and associated 95% 
CI were reported.  A KM plot of PFS for this subset of patients was presented by treatment group. 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed to assess for possible attrition bias, evaluation time bias 
and ascertainment bias (see Section 1.3.6.1 for further details).  A sensitivity analysis for deviation 
bias was to be conducted if the proportion of patients with deviations that could specifically affect 
efficacy was >10%; however the criteria for this analysis were not met.

Note: Table 11.3.5.1.1 reports that 5/91 (5.4%) olaparib-treated patients vs 1/60 (1.6%) placebo-treated patients in the SAS discontinued 
treatment due to AEs.  Table 11.3.5.1.1 does not include one patient (placebo arm) who had an AE of back pain which occurred prior to study 
treatment (see Appendix 12.2.7.6).  This event was ongoing during treatment and resulted in the discontinuation of study drug, however, as the 
event occurred prior to treatment it was not captured in Table 11.3.5.1.1.  In Table 11.1.1, one Patient (olaparib arm) was reported to have 
discontinued study drug due to subjective disease progression, however, the patient also discontinued treatment on the same day due to an AE 
of decreased appetite; the AE of decreased appetite is captured in Table 11.3.5.1.1. 
Subjective progression was based on investigator local disease assessment as recorded on the CRF. 
Any reason not specifically recorded, for example patient died. 
One Patient in the olaparib arm and one Patient in the placebo arm voluntarily withdrew from the study.  Post follow-up these patients were 
subsequently reported to have died.

Protocol deviations 
The number of patients with important protocol deviations in each treatment group are summarised in 
Table 5. Important protocol deviations (FAS)  
This section describes important protocol deviations that could have affected the interpretation of the 
primary efficacy analysis or the analysis related to the secondary safety objectives.  The FAS 
population was used for the summaries of efficacy data, and no patients were excluded from this 
population for important protocol deviations. 
The important protocol deviations and those important protocol deviations identified as having the 
potential to affect efficacy outcomes and trigger a pre-planned sensitivity analysis if they occurred in 
>10% patients were identified and classified prior to database lock, in a blinded manner, for the 
primary DCO (15 January 2019).

The 2 treatment arms were balanced with respect to the percentage of patients with important 
protocol deviations.  In total, 2.6% of patients (2.2% in the olaparib arm and 3.2% in the placebo 
arm) had protocol deviations that could have triggered a sensitivity analysis; however, this analysis 
was not conducted as the SAP pre-defined 10% threshold was not reached.

Disease characteristics 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The disease characteristics of the patients at baseline are summarised in Table 7. Disease 
characteristics at baseline (FAS). Baseline characteristics of the target population of patients with 
gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease had not progressed following first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy were generally well balanced between the 2 treatment groups.   
Of the patients tested by Myriad who had an unknown BRCA mutation status at study entry, the 
prevalence of confirmed gBRCAm patients was 6.2% (198/3175 patients).  Two patients were 
incorrectly identified as having unknown BRCA mutation status and were inadvertently included in the 
original analysis.  Correcting for this error the prevalence of confirmed gBRCAm patients should be 
6.2% (196/3175). 
The primary tumour location in the majority of patients in both arms was the pancreas; One Patient in 
the olaparib arm and one Patient in the placebo arm did not receive treatment and did not have their 
primary tumour location recorded.  A n o t h e r   Patient had histology type at diagnosis recorded as 
“cannot be determined”, however had a primary tumour location specified as the pancreas. 
There were no locally advanced patients enrolled in the study (patients had general [sites not specified] 
or specific sites of metastasis prior to first-line chemotherapy).  In both treatment arms, the most 
frequently reported site of disease for patients with evidence of metastatic disease at baseline was the 
liver.  Four patients (2 in the olaparib arm and 2 in the placebo arm) had NED at baseline (ie, no target 
lesion and no non-target lesion).

Relates to Patient with histology type at diagnosis recorded as “cannot be determined”. 
Patients were to have general or specific sites of metastases for study enrolment. 
Summary includes sites of disease where the extent is recorded as metastatic or both (ie, locally advanced and metastatic). Sites of metastases 
at baseline assessed post patient response to first-line chemotherapy, prior to study treatment. 
Overall, 48 patients were randomised on the basis of a locally available BRCA testing result. 
One Patient(in the olaparib arm) should have been included in the “BRCA status previously known” cohort but was inadvertently mis-
assigned to the “unknown” cohort.  This patient had incomplete local gBRCA results recorded in the eCRF, leading to missing local gBRCA 
information (ie, BRCA variant classification information) in the analysis dataset.  Therefore, in the olaparib arm and total columns

respectively, there should be 31 (33.7%) and 48 (31.2%) patients in the “known” group and 61 (66.3%) and 106 (68.8%) patients in the 
“unknown” group in the FAS (see Table 11.1.9).

Contains ‘deleterious mutation’ and ‘genetic variant, suspected deleterious’. 
Missing locally confirmed gBRCA status included patients with no local test result available who consented to provide blood samples for 
gBRCA testing by Myriad as per protocol.  Also includes 2 patients with incomplete reporting of the local result in the eCRF.  These patients 
were included in the “missing” group as one Patient had only information on which BRCA gene was mutated and one Patient had neither 
information on which BRCA gene was mutated nor which BRCA variant was detected, reported in the eCRF.

Data derived from Table 11.1.9, Table 11.1.10 and Table 11.1.17 and Appendix 12.2.2.1. 
All patients who received study treatment had received 1 prior regimen of disease-related chemotherapy 
at baseline (Table 8. Summary of previous disease-related chemotherapy at baseline (FAS)).  
Two patients were not known to have received a prior chemotherapy treatment for metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma; these 2 patients did not receive study treatment.  Another one patient received 2 
previous treatment regimens of FOLFIRINOX as neo-adjuvant and adjuvant treatment for pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.  The time between the patient receiving the last dose of adjuvant treatment and 
initiation of the platinum-based chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma was 
approximately 10 months; this did not meet the criteria for important or major protocol deviations. 
A further patient did not receive a minimum of 16 weeks of continuous treatment with a first-line 
platinum-based regimen; the patient received 10 weeks of treatment and was recorded as having an 
important protocol deviation.

median (range) number of FOLFIRINOX cycles was 9 (4:61) in the olaparib and 9 (4:21) in the placebo 
arm.  
For platinum-containing regimens, data on the number of cycles could be determined for 71 patients.  
FOLFIRINOX was the most common therapy (47 patients).  The median (min:max) number of cycles of

Concomitant medication after study entry 
The most commonly received concomitant medications were generally received by a higher proportion 
of patients in the olaparib group. 
In total, 4 (4.3%) patients in the olaparib arm and 2 (3.2%) patients in the placebo arm received 
disallowed concomitant medication (Table 10. Disallowed concomitant medications during 
study treatment (FAS)).  The use of disallowed concomitant medication did not raise concerns about 
the conduct of the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
The DCO for the analysis of PFS (15 January 2018) took place when 104 PFS events (67.5% maturity) 
had occurred, approximately 48 months after the first patient was randomised. At this time 71 deaths 
had also occurred and were included in a planned OS interim analysis. At this DCO, all efficacy, quality of 
life (QoL) and safety variables were analysed, as appropriate, based on the amount of data available at 
that time. No further analyses of PFS are planned unless requested by Health Authorities.

Primary outcome variable: progression-free survival by BICR 
PFS (based on BICR) was the primary variable for the study and was analysed at the primary DCO (15 
January 2019) based on the FAS analysis population.  The progression status based on BICR at the time of 
PFS analysis is presented in Table 12. Progression status (BICR) at the time of progression-free 
survival 
At the time of DCO there were 104 PFS events (67.5% maturity) with a higher proportion on the placebo 
arm than the olaparib arm (71.0% placebo vs 65.2% olaparib, respectively).  Five of the PFS events 
were deaths in the absence of RECIST progression (excluding censoring due to 2 or more missed RECIST 
visits); all of which occurred in the olaparib arm. Approximately an equal percentage of patients in both 
arms had PD due to progression of a target or non-target lesion, or developing new lesions.  Overall, 30 
(32.6%) patients in the olaparib arm vs 12 (19.4%) patients in the placebo arm were progression-free at 
the time of analysis.  Thirty (32.6%) patients in the olaparib arm and 8 (12.9%) patients randomised to 
placebo were still taking their assigned study treatment at the time of DCO.

the sensitivity analyses of PFS performed at DCO (evaluation time bias, attrition bias and ascertainment 
bias [hereafter referred to as investigator assessment]).  Analysis of deviation bias was not performed as 
specified in the protocol due to ≤10% of patients having the specified deviations. 
Sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival by investigator assessment 
The sensitivity analysis of PFS by investigator assessment confirmed the analysis by BICR assessment 
with a HR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.34, 0.78; Table 18).  The median PFS of 6.3 months for olaparib vs 3.7 
months for placebo, was consistent with that of the PFS analysis by BICR.  The KM plot for PFS by 
investigator assessment is presented in Figure 4.

Disagreement between investigator and BICR on RECIST progression 
Disagreement between investigator and BICR assessment of RECIST v1.1 progression is presented in 
Table 15. Disagreement between investigator and central reviews of RECIST v1.1 progression 
(FAS).  Overall, 28 (18.2%) patients were discordant between investigator and BICR based progression 
([6+12+7+3]/154).  As the difference between treatment arms in early discrepancy rate was positive and 
the difference between treatment arms in late discrepancy rate was negative, there was no suggestion of 
bias in the investigator favouring the olaparib arm.

Secondary outcome variables 
Overall survival 
At the time of the DCO, 53.3% of olaparib-treated patients and 43.5% of patients in the placebo arm were 
alive and in survival follow-up.  At the time of the PFS analysis, the interim OS data were 46% mature 
(71/154 events; Table 17. Summary of overall survival (FAS)).  The median OS was 18.9 months in 
the olaparib arm and 18.1 months in the placebo arm.  The HR suggested no OS detriment for olaparib-
treated patients.  Based on KM estimates, in the olaparib arm, the percentage of patients who remained 
alive were 70.0% at 12 months, 54.0% at 18 months, 37.9% at 24 months and 34.7% at 36 months

(n=46, 28, 14 and 4, respectively), compared with 66.5%, 51.6%, 35.3% and 24.7% in the placebo arm 
(n=29, 18, 8 and 1, respectively). 
The KM plot for OS is presented in Figure 5. Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier plot (FAS)Final OS 
analysis will be conducted when approximately 106 deaths have occurred (69% maturity). 
The percentage of patients whose subsequent therapy included a PARP inhibitor was 14.5% (9/62)

Time from randomisation to second progression 
The date of second progression was recorded by the investigator and defined according to local standard 
clinical practice and could involve any of objective radiological or symptomatic progression or death.  At 
the time of DCO there were 71 PFS2 events (46% maturity) with a higher proportion in the placebo arm 
than the olaparib arm.  Overall, 55.4% of patients in the olaparib arm vs 51.6% of patients in the placebo 
arm were second progression free at the time of analysis (includes censored patients, patients lost to 
follow-up and patients who discontinued from study). 
The median PFS2 in the olaparib arm was 13.2 months compared with 9.2 months in the placebo arm; 
a median difference of 4 months.  While there was no statistically significant difference, the delay in 
time from randomisation to second progression or death (PFS2) suggested a trend in favour of 
olaparib treatment (Table 18. Summary of second progression-free survival (FAS)).  The KM 
plot for PFS2 is presented in Figure 6. Second progression-free survival, Kaplan-Meier plot

Time from randomisation to first subsequent therapy or death 
The median TFST in the olaparib arm was 8.6 months compared with 5.7 months in the placebo arm 
(Table 19. Summary of time from randomisation to first subsequent cancer therapy or death 
(FAS)). Although not controlled for multiplicity, the delay in TFST was statistically significant in the 
olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm. This was consistent with the benefit observed in the PFS 
analysis (Section 7.1.1). The KM plot for TFST is presented in Figure 7. Time from randomisation to

The median TDT in the olaparib arm was 7.2 months compared with 3.8 months in the placebo arm 
(Table 21. Summary of time from randomisation to study treatment discontinuation or death

Applies only to those patients entering the study with no disease at baseline according to BICR. 
Patients in the not evaluable category with SD <7 weeks recorded as the reason were: one Patient(randomised to the olaparib arm and 
immediately withdrawn prior to treatment due to disease progression); one Patient (started treatment with olaparib on the 12 June 2018 and 
had objective disease progression assessed by the Investigator on the 27 July 2018, 45 days after starting treatment); another  Patient (started 
treatment with placebo on the 5 December 2017 and had objective disease progression assessed by the Investigator on the 18 January 2018, 
44 days after starting treatment).

11.2.9.1.1, Appendix 12.2.2.2, Appendix 12.2.1.5 and Appendix 12.2.6.2.2. 
ORR based on BICR data for patients in the FAS with measurable disease at baseline was higher for 
patients in the olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm (23.1% vs 11.5%, respectively; odds 
ratio=2.30; 95% CI 0.89, 6.76; p=0.1028 [nominal]). Results for ORR based on investigator assessment 
were consistent with those based on BICR assessment. 
The median DoR based on BICR data was longer in the olaparib arm (24.9 months; 95% CI 14.75, not 
calculable) than in the placebo arm (3.7 months; 95% CI 2.10, not calculable), with a longer median 
time to onset of response (5.4 months [95% CI 3.65, 5.55] for olaparib and 3.6 months [95% CI 1.58, 
7.13] for placebo).  Results for DoR based on investigator assessment were consistent with those based 
on BICR assessment. 
Disease control rate 
Based on BICR data a greater proportion of patients in the olaparib arm (53.3%) compared with the 
placebo arm (37.1%) had disease control at 16 weeks following randomisation.  Results for disease control 
at 16 weeks based on investigator assessment were consistent with those based on BICR assessment.

Secondary and exploratory variables: Patient-reported outcomes 
Global HRQoL was the key PRO variable of interest in this study.  The overall compliance rates for the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 were high in both treatment arms.  The treatment arms were balanced at baseline.  
Baseline scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 global HRQoL score (global health status/QoL, items 29 and 30) 
were high and balanced for all patients (means for the olaparib and placebo arms, respectively, were 
70.4/100 and 74.3/100).     
Change from baseline in global HRQoL score was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis of all of the post-baseline HRQoL scores by treatment group and visit.  As 
shown in Table 26, there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the 
overall adjusted mean change from baseline in global HRQoL score.  The adjusted mean change from 
baseline in global HRQoL score across all time points up to 6 months was -1.20 in the olaparib arm and 
1.27 in the placebo arm.  This corresponded to an estimated difference between the treatment arms of ‑
2.47 points, in the context of an EORTC scale of 100 points. 
Overall patient-reported outcome data demonstrated olaparib maintenance treatment preserved overall 
HRQoL as no statistically significant or clinically meaningful worsening was observed in global HRQoL 
score compared with placebo.

Global health status/QoL score consists of item 29 and 30 of QLQ-C30.  The HRQoL score ranges from 0 to 100.  A higher score indicates better 
QoL.  A score change of 10-point was pre-defined as clinically meaningful.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of progression-free survival 
Analyses for the primary endpoint (PFS by BICR) for 11 subgroups (10 pre-defined and ECOG 
performance status included as an additional exploratory subgroup) were conducted to assess the 
consistency of treatment effect across potential or expected prognostic factors. The forest plot of PFS by 
subgroup is presented in

study was not powered to assess efficacy within individual subgroups and due to the multiple testing, the 
analyses should be interpreted with caution.

Figure 12. Progression-free survival per best response on first-line treatment, Kaplan-Meier 
plot (FAS)). The median PFS in olaparib-treated patients in the PR/CR and SD subgroups was 7.4 
months compared with 3.8 and 3.9 months in placebo-treated patients, respectively. 
The global interaction test was not statistically significant at the 10% level (p=0.2106; see Table 
11.2.3.4). Overall, these results indicate that olaparib is an effective maintenance treatment option 
irrespective of potential or expected prognostic factors. In addition, an exploratory post hoc multivariate 
Cox analysis (selected key prognostic baseline factors of: best response to first-line treatment [CR/PR vs 
SD], time on first-line treatment [≤6 months, >6 months], age group [<65 years, ≥65 years], ECOG 
performance status [0, 1], and type of previous chemotherapy [FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/cisplatin, 
other] were included in the model) illustrated that the primary analysis result was not impacted by any 
imbalances in the baseline factors (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.39, 0.88).

ITT: The primary statistical analysis of the efficacy of olaparib included all 
randomised patients and compared the treatment groups on the basis of 
randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received.  Patients 
who were randomised but did not subsequently go on to receive study 
treatment were included in the FAS.  Therefore, all efficacy data were 
summarised and analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis.

Supportive study 
Study D0810C00042.  A Phase II, Open-Label, Non-Randomised, Non-Comparative, Multicentre 
Study to Assess the Efficacy And Safety of Olaparib Given Orally Twice Daily in Patients With 
Advanced Cancers Who Have A Confirmed Genetic BRCA1 And/Or BRCA2 Mutation 
Supportive efficacy data (utilising the capsule formulation) are provided by 23 gBRCAm patients from the 
Phase  II  study  D0810C00042  (Study  42) that  investigated  response  of  patients  with gBRCAm  advanced 
solid  malignancies,  including  pancreatic  cancer.  This  study  did  not  have  a  comparator  arm  and  was  not 
conducted in the maintenance treatment setting. In Study 42, confirmation of gBRCA mutated disease was 
required  at  study  entry  and  patients  were  also  to  be  gBRCAm  and  were  to  have  either  failed  standard 
treatment or no standard of care existed for their advanced cancer.  Patients in the pancreatic cohort had 
either  failed  or  were  unsuitable  for  gemcitabine  treatment  in  the  advanced  setting.    Unlike  POLO  which 
recruited only patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the maintenance setting, Study 42 
included  patients  with  solid  tumours  other  than  pancreatic  cancer  and  treated  patients  with  olaparib 
monotherapy at the time of relapse. 
Primary objective: To  assess  the  efficacy of  oral  olaparib in  patients with advanced cancer  who  had a 
confirmed gBRCA1 and/or gBRCA2 mutation by assessment of tumour response. 
Key secondary objectives: To assess the efficacy of oral olaparib in patients with advanced cancers who 
had a confirmed gBRCA1  and/or gBRCA2 mutation, by assessment of ORR, PFS, OS, DoR  and DCR.  To 
determine the safety and tolerability of oral olaparib in patients with advanced cancers who had a confirmed 
gBRCA1 and/or gBRCA2 mutation. 
Design: This was a single-arm (ie, no comparator arm), open-label study.  After starting treatment with 
olaparib 400 mg bd orally, patients attended periodic clinic visits for assessment of safety and efficacy until 
confirmed  objective  disease  progression  occurred  according  to  RECIST  1.1.  Following  confirmed  disease 
progression, patients discontinued olaparib treatment but could receive any other cancer treatment at the 
investigator’s discretion. 
Patients: A total of 298 patients (62 breast cancer patients, 193 ovarian cancer patients, 23 pancreatic 
cancer patients, 8 prostate cancer patients, and 12 patients with another type of cancer) received olaparib 
at  13 sites  in  6 countries  (Israel,  United  States  of  America  [USA],  Australia,  Germany,  Spain,  and 
Sweden).All  298 patients were  included in  the  safety analysis set.  Patients were  ≥18 years  of  age  with 
histologically  and/or  cytologically  confirmed  malignant  solid  tumours  that  were  refractory  to  standard 
therapy and  for  which  no  suitable, effective/curative therapy  existed.  Patients had  to  have  a  confirmed 
documented deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation. The demographic characteristics of this 
heavily pre-treated advanced disease study population were generally representative of each tumour type, 
independent of gBRCA status. 
Study results: For the pancreatic cancer setting, patients had to have either failed or be unsuitable for 
gemcitabine treatment in the advanced setting. 
Twenty-three patients with pancreatic cancer were enrolled and received olaparib in Study 42; of these, 21 
patients  had  discontinued  as  of  the  DCO  for  the  CSR,  14  patients  due  to  development  of  study  specific 
discontinuation  criteria,  5  patients  due  to  disease  progression,  1 patient  due  to  subject  decision  and  1 
patient with a reason of “other” (2 patients were ongoing at DCO).

The mean age of the patients with pancreatic cancer in Study 42 was 57.1 (standard deviation [std] 7.99) 
years and 13 (56.5%) patients were male and 10 (43.5%) were female.  The majority of patients were 
White (21 [91.3%] patients) followed by Black or African American and Asian (1 patient each).  The mean 
weight of the patients with pancreatic cancer was 68.7 kg.  ECOG PS at baseline was “0” for 11 (47.8%) 
patients, “1” for 9 (39.1%) patients and “2”, for 3 (13.0%) patients.  Five (21.7%) patients were BRCA1 
positive and 17 (73.9%) patients were BRCA2 positive; 1 patient was positive for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.  
Nineteen (82.6%) patients had metastatic pancreatic cancer and 4 (17.4%) patients had locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer disease prior to commencing chemotherapy.  The time from diagnosis to first dose was 
≤2 years for 20 (87.0%) patients and >2 to ≤5 years for 3 (13.0%) patients.  A total of 21 (91.3%) patients 
with pancreatic cancer had received prior gemcitabine based chemotherapy (see Table 11.1.3.4, Study 42 
CSR Module 5.3.5.2), and 12 (52.2%) patients had received 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy (see 
Table 11.1.3.2, Study 42 CSR Module 5.3.5.2). 
Patients  were  to  receive  olaparib  until  confirmed  objective  disease  progression  occurred  according  to 
RECIST 1.1.  Following confirmed disease progression, patients discontinued olaparib treatment but could 
receive any other cancer treatment at the investigator’s discretion.   
The median total treatment duration in patients with pancreatic cancer in Study 42 was 170.0 days (range: 
9 to 723 days; approximately 5.6 months).  The median actual treatment duration was 167 days in the 
pancreatic cancer group. 
There were 7 (30.4%) patients in the pancreatic cancer group patients who had dose interruptions in the 
study  and  2 (8.7%)  patients  in  the  pancreatic  cancer  group  had  dose  reduction  in  the  study.  Dose 
modifications  (an  interruption  and/or  reduction)  were  reported  in  a  total  of  7  (30.4%)  patients  in  the 
pancreatic  cancer  group.  AE  was  the  most  common  reason  for  dose  interruptions,  dose  reductions,  and 
dose modifications. 
Summary of efficacy  
A  summary  of  the  efficacy  data  from  Study 42  is  presented  in  Table  28.  Summary  of  efficacy  across

PFS was a secondary outcome in Study 42.  The median PFS was 4.55 months in patients with gBRCAm 
pancreatic cancer (Table 28. Summary of efficacy across olaparib studies: other supportive study 
(Study 42)).  Additionally, 36.4% of patients in the pancreatic cancer cohort remained progression-free at 
6 months. 
Overall survival  
OS was a secondary outcome in Study 42 and was defined as the time from the start date of study 
treatment until death due to any cause.  Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was 
censored based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive.  In Study 42 the 
median OS was 9.81 months in the gBRCAm pancreatic cancer cohort, with a survival rate at 6 months of 
63.6% and 40.9% at 12 months (Table 28. Summary of efficacy across olaparib studies: other supportive 
study (Study 42)).   
Subsequent therapy use was documented for 12/23 (52.2%) of patients with pancreatic cancer in Study 
42. 
Other efficacy endpoints  
Median DoR (134.0 days) and DCR (47.8% of patients at 16 weeks) also supported the findings from 
POLO that olaparib demonstrates activity in patients with gBRCAm pancreatic cancer (Table 28. Summary 
of efficacy across olaparib studies: other supportive study (Study 42)). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  MAH  submitted  a  type  II  variation  application  to  the  current  marketing  authorisation  of  Lynparza 
seeking a new therapeutic indication as maintenance treatment of gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
The main evidence of the efficacy of olaparib in the pancreatic setting came from the study D081FC00001 
(POLO). POLO is a 3:2 randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre phase III trial designed to 
assess  the  efficacy  of  olaparib  maintenance  monotherapy  in  patients  with  gBRCA  mutated  metastatic 
pancreatic  cancer.  Eligible  patients  presented  gBRCAm  metastatic  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma  and  not 
disease  progression  after  receiving  a  minimum  of  16  weeks  of  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy. 
There were no maximum of cycles of chemotherapy and patients should have started treatment between 
4  and  8  weeks  from  last  chemotherapy  treatment.  Crossover  to  olaparib  arm  was  not  permitted.  The 
primary endpoint of the study is PFS.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
According to clinical guidelines for pancreatic cancer (NCCN GL v3.2019 and ESMO 2015), metastatic 
patients with good PS (ECOG 0-2) are eligible for chemotherapy; preferred regimens are FOLFIRINOX or 
Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel. In the presence of known BRCA 1/2 mutations, preferred 
regimens are FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine + cisplatin (recommendation category 2A - NCCN GL v3.2019 
for pancreatic cancer). Currently, there is no approved therapy indicated for the maintenance of adult 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in first line setting. Nevertheless, the complete chemotherapy 
regimen is usually continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for which its components 
can be discontinued.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered acceptable and seemed to define a specific population 
of pancreatic cancer. The patients randomised in this study were representative of the intended target 
population. Nevertheless, very little is known about the prognostic and predictive value of germline 
BRCA1/2 mutations in the metastatic pancreatic cancer setting and whether the presence of these 
mutations designate a different subpopulation among unselected pancreatic cancer patients. There are 
only a few publications that describe the natural history after receiving standard of care therapy, 
treatment response and other outcomes in the gBRCAm pancreatic cancer patient population. 
The largest study prior to POLO was from Golan et al who reported a retrospective study investigating the 
impact of gBRCA1 and gBRCA2 mutations on the natural history of gBRCAm pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
and therapeutic outcome following the use of platinum agents (Golan et al 2014).  In patients with Stage 
IV disease, median OS of platinum treated patients (n=14 patients) was 15 months compared with 7 
months for those treated with non-platinum chemotherapy (n=14 patients, P=0.276). When combining 
data for Stages III and IV (“advanced disease”), the median OS was 22 months for the platinum-exposed 
patients (n=22 patients) compared with 9 months for the non-platinum exposed patients (n=21 patients, 
P=0.039).  Golan et al reported median PFS results of 3 months for stage IV gBRCAm pancreatic cancer 
patients who were treated with either platinum (n=12 patients) or non-platinum (n=18 patients) as first-
line chemotherapy (Golan et al 2013).  
In a retrospective survival analysis of patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and gBRCA or 
PALB2 mutations (Reiss et al 2018), 29 patients with advanced PDAC (Stage III n=5 patients, Stage IV 
n=24 patients) were matched to patients who were non-carrier or untested by age at diagnosis, year of 
diagnosis, stage and sex.  The median OS was 21.8 months for patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 
mutations compared to an OS of 8.1 months for patients without mutations (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.2 to 
0.62; P <0.001).  For patients with mutations who received platinum treatment, the median OS was not 
reached (median follow-up, 20.1 months), versus an OS of 6.1 months for the patients with no platinum 
exposure.  When the patients with mutations who had received no systemic therapy at all were 
eliminated (n=4 patients), the median OS increased to 15.3 months for patients with no platinum 
exposure. 
There are two relatively large studies while not directly looking at gBRCA-associated pancreatic cancer 
that assessed the natural history of the disease in related populations. 
Pishvaian et al 2019 reported the clinical results from the ‘Know Your Tumor Program’ and demonstrated 
that DNA damage repair (DDR) deficiencies (which includes BRCA1 and BRCA2) predict OS improvement 
in platinum-treated advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage III unresectable and Stage IV).  In 
advanced pancreatic cancer patients with a DDR mutation, median OS was 2.37 years (28.4 months; 
n=54 patients) for those who received prior platinum treatment compared to 1.08 years (13.0 months; 
n=19 patients) for those who did not receive platinum treatment. In contrast, in the DDR-proficient 
patients (patients without DDR mutations), median OS was 1.44 years (17.3 months; n=258 patients) 
with prior platinum treatment compared to 1.08 years (13.0 months; n=114 patients) with prior non-
platinum treatment. 
Fogelman et al 2015 reviewed cases of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma from patients at two 
institutions (John Hopkins University and MD Anderson Cancer Center) who had a family history of 
tumours associated with BRCA mutation (breast, ovarian and pancreatic).  The hypothesis was that 
patients with a strong family history might have DDR defects and would preferentially benefit from DNA 
damaging agents such as platinum based therapy.  The use of platinum chemotherapy was found to be 
associated with superior survival in patients with a strong family history of these cancers.  In patients

with three or more relatives harboring such cancers, individuals who received platinum therapy at any 
point (n=16 patients) presented a superior survival benefit compared to those patients (n=6 patients) 
with no history of platinum therapy (median OS 21.7 months vs 12 months, HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 
0.76, p=0.004).  However, no such trend was observed in patients who had no family history of these 
tumours and who received either platinum (n=190 patients) or non-platinum (n=151 patients) 
chemotherapy (median OS 8.3 months vs 7.5 months, respectively). 
These results indicate that at least some patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations may survive 2 years 
or more after diagnosis (depending on clinical stage at presentation) whereas median OS reported for 
non-selected pancreas cancer is 9 to 12 month in patients treated with FOLFIRINOX (Conroy et al 2011, 
Von Hoff et al 2013).   
Patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes were 
eligible based on local and central testing, with retrospective confirmation of the mutation status.  The 
high number of screened patients (more than 3000) needed to select a sufficient number of patients 
(about 250) for further screening illustrates the rarity of condition and potential difficulties in detecting 
patients eligible for the intended treatment in clinical practice.  
Eligible patients should have received a minimum of 16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease with no maximum number of cycles. POLO trial was designed for patients who 
could not be treated successfully with platinum-based chemotherapy until disease progression, with 
enrolment of patients corresponding to 2 patterns: patients who are non-progressing, but who can no 
longer tolerate platinum-based chemotherapy and patients who have completed 6 months of 
chemotherapy per the original FOLFIRINOX treatment. In case patients discontinued platinum component 
(oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin) due to toxicity after at least 16 weeks of treatment and continued to 
be treated with the remaining drugs of the initial regimen, they were still eligible if no evidence of disease 
progression within 4 weeks after their last dose of chemotherapy. No objective criteria seemed to have 
been used to start olaparib apart from toxicity. If therapy is reasonably tolerated, platinum-containing 
regimens are usually continued beyond 16 weeks (Ducreux et al, Sem in Onc, 2019; Dahan et al, 2018; 
Controy et al, 2011).  It is not clear how the number of cycles for chemotherapy components, and in 
particular platinum, was balanced beyond the minimal 16–week period and recorded to ensure a similar 
exposure between two arms as the information on previous therapies was not comprehensively collected. 
The initially proposed indication concerned germline BRCA mutated patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas whose disease has not progressed on a first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen. It was requested to specify according to eligibility criteria that threshold of 16 
weeks concerning minimal duration of the platinum component has been considered and not the duration 
of the complete platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen, for which there was no upper limit imposed. 
PFS was the primary endpoint in POLO study supported by OS, PFS2, TFST, TSST, TDT, BoR, DCR, and 
PRO as secondary endpoints. Regrettably, a scientific advice has not been sought for the POLO study.  
The primary endpoint of PFS does not correspond to usual requirement for a study design in patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer where OS is highly recommended as primary endpoint (EMA/CHMP/205/95 
Rev. 5). 
Even if prolonged PFS might be considered to be of benefit to the patients, the selection of PFS as 
primary endpoint would not be entirely sufficient. In the context of maintenance therapy, PFS2 is 
considered highly valuable to evaluate the impact on tumour’s drug resistance profile affected by therapy 
and the activity of next-line therapies.

All efficacy variables were calculated using the ITT population. The PFS is analysed using a log-rank test 
for generation of the p-value and using the Breslow approach for handling ties using BICR data. Several 
sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate potential bias effect due to attrition and ascertainment, 
and the influence of the implemented censoring results 
The comparisons between olaparib and placebo arms on all other variables (PFS2, TFST, TSST, TDT and 
HRQoL) in this study are not confirmatory, because there was no multiplicity adjustment plan for 
secondary endpoints in this study. 
A multiple testing procedure was also employed across the primary endpoint (PFS) and the secondary 
endpoint of OS. The interpretation of the subgroup results is difficult, since the sample size in each 
subgroup was not planned to power such analyses for detecting the same magnitude of the treatment 
effect. The study was not designed for the identification and confirmation of subgroups of patients 
benefiting from treatment. 
Two protocol amendments and 5 versions of the SAP (plus supplementary SAP after the DCO) have been 
issued. Among changes introduced, those in regard to interim PFS analysis are discussed below. 
The important deviations necessitating sensitivity analysis above the threshold of 10% have been 
reported in 2.6% of patients.  However, other types of important deviations occurred overall in 22.8% 
and 21% of patients in olaparib and placebo arm, respectively. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal study 
A total of 3315 patients were screened for POLO study. From these, 247 patients were determined to 
have a gBRCA mutation and 167 patients were finally enrolled in the study; 92 were allocated to olaparib 
arm, 62 to placebo arm and 13 were not randomized. From the FAS/ITT population (154 patents), only 3 
patients did not receive study medication; 2 in the olaparib arm and 1 in the placebo arm. 
At the time of DCO (approximately 49 months after the first patient was enrolled), more patients were 
still on treatment on the olaparib arm (32.6%) than in the placebo arm (12.9%). In both arms, the main 
cause of study treatment discontinuation was objective disease progression with a higher incidence in the 
placebo arm (46.7% vs 64.5%, olaparib vs placebo, respectively). Further, 12.0% (11/92) of the patients 
in the olaparib arm and 14.5% (9/62) in the placebo arm discontinued due to disease progression by 
investigator local disease assessment. The main cause of study withdrawal was death (43.5% vs 46.8%, 
olaparib vs placebo, respectively).  
In the FAS, baseline patient demographic and disease/tumour characteristics were in general well 
balanced between treatment arms. Disease characteristics at baseline in the Myriad confirmed gBRCAm 
subset were consistent with the FAS and well balanced between the 2 treatments arms . The median age 
of the enrolled patients is 57.0 years old in both arms. There is evidence suggesting that BRCA mutated 
patients may present an early onset of the disease (Holter et al 2015, Toss et al 2019). There was a 
higher percentage of patients aged ≥65 year patients in the olaparib arm (30.4%) compared with the 
placebo arm (21.0%).   
Overall, there were proportionally more males in the olaparib arm than in the placebo arm.  The majority 
of patients were White.  There was a higher percentage of patients who were non-White in the olaparib 
arm compared with the placebo arm (10.9% versus 4.8%, respectively).   
Assessment report

Related to disease characteristics at baseline, median time from original diagnosis to randomisation was 
6.87 months in the olaparib arm and 6.97 months in the placebo arm. However, there were patients for 
which this time was of 38.4 months in the olaparib arm and 30.6 months in the placebo arm. The main 
histology type was pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All the patients were metastatic and the main site of 
metastasis prior to chemotherapy was liver (70.8%), followed to a lesser extent by lymph node (22.7%), 
lung (9.7%) and peritoneum (9.7%). Slight differences on the presence of biliary stent (1.1% olaparib vs 
6.6%placebo) and extent of disease at baseline (metastatic 94.6% for olaparib vs 88.7% for placebo) 
were also observed. Patients were in relatively good condition as the majority of patients presented an 
ECOG PS of 0; more patients in the olaparib arm had an ECOG performance status of ‘normal activity’ (0) 
compared with the placebo arm (65 [70.7%] and 38 [61.3%] patients, respectively).   
Overall, 48 (31.2%) patients were randomised on the basis of a prior locally determined BRCA mutation; 
2 patients did not provide sufficient details of the local test in the eCRF. Overall, 46 patients with 
sufficient details of the locally determined BRCA mutation were reported, 15 (9.7%) patients had BRCA1 
mutations, 30 (19.5%) patients had BRCA2 mutations and 1 (0.6%) patient was reported to carry both 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. In total, 150 (97.4%) patients were confirmed to be gBRCAm by Myriad; of 
those, 45 (30.0%) had BRCA1 mutations, 104 (69.3%) had BRCA2 mutations and 1 (0.7%) patient 
carried both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.  Four (2.6%) patients were not reviewed by Myriad and were 
excluded from the subset of Myriad confirmed gBRCAm patients; these patients were reported as 
gBRCAm by local testing. The proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was well balanced in both 
groups with a higher incidence of total BRCA2 mutations (67.5%) compared to total BRCA1 mutations 
(29.2%) which is not unexpected. 
Almost all the patients received only one regimen (98.1% - 151/154) of previous chemotherapy which in 
the majority of the cases were FOLFIRINOX variants (83.8%). Considering that 20.8% patients received 
the previous non disease-related chemotherapy treatment and 9.1% patients with non disease-related 
“other” treatments (eg, hormonal therapy) for another cancer, there is and indirect indication that at 
least 1/5 patients could suffer from previous primary malignancy before occurrence of the pancreatic 
cancer. Several primary malignancies often occur in gBRCAm patients during their life course. The time 
on first-line treatment until randomisation was equal or inferior to six months in 65.6% (101/154) of the 
total cases. The best response to the first-line treatment were well balance in both arms being stable 
disease in most of the total cases (49.4% - 76/154). Overall, the concomitant treatments administered 
were representative of those commonly prescribed for patients of the target population and were not 
considered to have impacted the study results. The use of concomitant medication was balanced between 
groups. 
From the 154 randomized patients in the FAS population (92 in the olaparib arm and 62 in the placebo 
arm), 3 patients were excluded from SAS population as they did not start study treatment (2 from the 
olaparib arm and 1 from the placebo arm). A total of 7 patients (3 in the olaparib arm and 4 in the 
placebo arm) were excluded from the PRO analysis set population due to the lack of evaluable forms at 
baseline. The demographics and baseline characteristics of the Myriad gBRCAm subset (n=150 patients) 
was similar to the FAS (n=154 patients). 
POLO study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by BICR in FAS population 
among metastatic gBRCAm patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after a platinum base first-line 
treatment. At the time of DCO (15 January 2019), 65.2% (60/92) of the patients in the olaparib arm had 
progressed compared to 71.0% (44/62) of the patients in the placebo arm (data maturity, 67.5%). Five 
of the PFS events were deaths in the absence of RECIST progression (excluding censoring due to 2 or 
Assessment report

more missed RECIST visits); all of which occurred in the olaparib arm. Thirty (32.6%) patients in the 
olaparib arm and 8 (12.9%) patients randomised to placebo were continuing study treatment at the time 
of DCO.Results showed a 47% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib than with placebo 
(HR 0.531, 95% IC 0.346 – 0.815, p-value 0.0038). The median of PFS showed a difference of 3.6 
months favouring olaparib arm (7.4 months vs 3.8 months). Regarding the Kaplan-Meier plot, a marked 
separation of the curves favouring olaparib arm was seen from the 4th month of treatment.  
In line with the protocol changes and per the SAP amendment 2, the interim superiority analysis (change 
to futility only) was deleted. This included recalculation of the number of events needed for the primary 
PFS analysis and change to the method used for Type 1 error adjustment for the interim and final 
analyses of overall survival. The futility analysis supervised by an IDMC should have been conducted 
according to the protocol and SAP when 44 PFS events have been recorded.  
According to the CSR, a single interim PFS analysis for futility was performed when 50% of the final 
number of progression events required for the primary PFS analysis had been reached (46 PFS events 
from 74 randomised patients) based on BICR. The interim analysis was performed by an IDMC. The 
futility assessment was based on the probability of eventually showing statistical significance for the 
primary endpoint when the final number of PFS events (n=87) was reached. If the observed HR for PFS 
at the interim was more than 1.02, the IDMC would have considered the option of declaring futility. The 
interim PFS analysis was conducted by another independent CRO to ensure the study integrity. The 
results of the analysis at 87 PFS events have been provided and are consistent with the primary analysis 
at 104 PFS events. PFS was 7.5 months in the olaparib arm and 3.7 months in the placebo arm, with HR 
of 0.457 (95%CI 0.287,; 0.727, p-value 0.0010).  
Sensitivity analysis of PFS by investigator assessment showed similar results and still statistically 
significant with a HR of 0.514 (95% IC 0.339 – 0.780, p-value 0.0017). The median PFS values were of 
6.3 months vs 3.7 months for olaparib vs placebo, showing therefore a gain of PFS of 2.6 months for 
olaparib arm which is one month less than results obtained by BICR. This discrepancy seemed not be 
driven by bias. Other PFS results for sensitivity analysis (attrition and evaluation time bias) were in line 
with PFS by BICR assessment. 
Subgroup analysis of PFS across various particular subgroups did not reveal an obvious differential benefit 
across pre-defined subgroups compared with the overall population.  
OS results did not show a statistical significance in OS improvement with a HR of 0.906 (95% IC 0.563 – 
1.457, p value = 0.6833) (maturity, 46%). Median OS were of 18.9 months vs 18.1, favouring olaparib 
vs placebo. Kaplan-Meier plot showed a clear separation of OS curves at month 26. It is unlikely that 
further maturation of the data would evidence a trend in OS. Further, similar proportion of patients in 
both arms presented a second progression at DCO (44.6% vs 48.4%) showing a HR for PFS2 of 0.755 
(95% CI 0.464 - 1.230, p value = 0.2597, median 13.2 months for olaparib and 9.2 months for placebo). 
Results showed a statistically significant delay in TFST for olaparib arm compared with placebo in the FAS 
population (HR 0.496, 95% IC 0.324 – 0.760, p value = 0.0013, median of 8.6 months for olaparib vs 5.7 
months for placebo). Even if the positive trend of the curves was observed in TSST, the difference seen 
in the median of these results (13.2 vs 9.2 months, olaparib vs placebo) did not demonstrated a 
statistical significance (HR 0.678, 95% IC 0.437 - 1.051, p value = 0.0825). Results for TDT were in line 
with those from PFS, showing a statistical significance with a value of HR of 0.446 (95% IC 0.297 – 
0.670, p value = 0.0001) and median results of 7.2 months for olaparib compared to 3.8 months for

placebo. The most common subsequent therapy reported after progression were platinum-based 
chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. 
The subsequent treatment after progression, especially PARP inhibitors use, has to be considered for 
long-term survival data analysis interpretation. Overall, 45/92 patients (48.9%) in the olaparib arm and 
46/62 patients (74.2%) in the placebo arm received subsequent cancer therapies. Even if no cross-over 
was allowed in POLO trial, subsequent PARP inhibitors were received by 1 (1.1%) and 9 (14.5%) of the 
olaparib-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. PARP inhibitors were received as the first 
subsequent therapy in 0 patients in the olaparib arm and 2 patients in the placebo arm. 
Related to results for BoR, a higher proportion of patients in olaparib arm reached a response (CR or PR) 
(19.6% - 18/92) compared to placebo arm (9.7% - 6/62). Most of these responses were PR in both arms 
(17.4% - 16/92 vs 9.7% - 6/62, olaparib vs placebo, respectively). CR was reached by two patients 
(2.2%) in the olaparib arm compared to none in the placebo arm (0.0%). Of note, patients that entered 
in the study with no measurable disease were classified under ‘non-response’. ORR by BICR was higher 
for patients in the olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm (23.1% vs 11.5%). Results for ORR 
based on investigator assessment were in line. A longer duration of the response was seen in olaparib 
arm (24.9 months) compared to placebo arm (3.7 months). As previously seen in other studies of 
olaparib, patients in placebo arm seemed to present a quicker onset of the response than those in 
olaparib arm (5.4 months vs 3.6 months). 
Overall, results from efficacy variables for Myriad gBRCAm patients are in line with those from the FAS 
population. 
The main PRO variable for HRQoL analysis was Global HRQoL score (global health status/QoL items 29 
and 30) of the EORTC QLQ-C30. The overall compliance rates for the QLQ-C30 were high in both 
treatment arms. The treatment arms were balanced in terms of baseline scores. This is expected in the 
maintenance treatment setting as disease burden at baseline is minimal post chemotherapy. Only visits 
with at least 25% of non-missing values in both treatment arms were included in the mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The study treatment discontinuation visit and the safety follow-up visit were 
excluded from the analysis, but the rationale has not been provided. There was no collection of data 
foreseen beyond progression.  There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment 
arms in the overall adjusted mean change from baseline in global HRQoL score. The adjusted mean 
change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 global HRQoL score across all time points up to 6 months was -
1.20±1.42 in the olaparib group (84 evaluable patients) and 1.27±1.95 in the placebo group (54 
evaluable patients), with a corresponding estimated difference of −2.47 points (95% CI −7.27 to 2.33; 
p=0.310 [nominal]). 
The analysis of time to pain progression using the QLQ-C30 pain domain suggested a trend in benefit for 
olaparib treatment compared with placebo (HR= 0.70; 95% CI: 0.437, 1.116), with a delay in time to 
worsening of pain. This is a patient- relevant outcome as metastatic pancreatic cancer patients frequently 
require help from a pain specialist for pain control and the use of potent narcotics (Ducreux et al 2015). 
Supportive study 
Supportive data from the pancreatic patients from study 42 were also provided. Study 42 was a phase II, 
open-label, non-randomised, non-comparative study to assess the efficacy and the safety of olaparib in 
advanced cancer who have confirmed a genetic BRCA1/ BRCA2 mutation. This study was not conducted in 
the maintenance setting. Patients in the pancreatic cohort had either failed or were unsuitable for 
gemcitabine treatment in the advanced setting. The dose was 400mg bd orally.

Twenty-three patients with pancreatic cancer were finally enrolled and received olaparib in Study 42. The 
mean age of the patients with pancreatic cancer in Study 42 was 57.1 (standard deviation [std] 7.99) 
years. The majority of patients were White (21 [91.3%] patients) followed by Black or African American 
and Asian (1 patient each).  ECOG PS at baseline was “0” for 11 (47.8%) patients, “1” for 9 (39.1%) 
patients and “2”, for 3 (13.0%) patients.  Five (21.7%) patients were BRCA1 positive and 17 (73.9%) 
patients were BRCA2 positive; 1 patient was positive for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.  Nineteen (82.6%) 
patients had metastatic pancreatic cancer and 4 (17.4%) patients had locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
disease prior to commencing chemotherapy.   
Patients were supposed to receive olaparib until confirmed objective disease progression. The median 
actual treatment duration was 167 days in the pancreatic cancer group. 
Results showed a ORR of 21.7% (7.46-43.70), a median PFS of 4.55 months (1.84-7.72), a median OS of 
9.81 months (5.62-16.36), a median DoR of 4.4 months and a DCR rate at 16 weeks of 47.8 (26.82-
69.41). 
Even if Study 42 investigated a different dose and formulation of olaparib and did not include a 
comparator, results supported the demonstration of olaparib activity in metastatic pancreatic cancer 
patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations. Its magnitude appears to be less important (ORR 22%) than in 
patients with breast or ovarian cancer harbouring gBRCAm. 
Additional expert consultation 
The Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology agreed that olaparib maintenance treatment was associated 
with activity and clinical effects in the proposed indication. The trial was robust in terms of internal and 
external validity.  
The clinical effect has been shown on the basis of prolongation of PFS. There was also improvement in 
some individual symptoms and a trend in delaying pain progression. There was no clear improvement but 
also no apparent detriment on other important clinical endpoints like HRQoL, PFS2, and OS, compared to 
placebo. However, OS data are still immature.   
According to a majority of SAG members, the benefit observed in the PFS in the overall population is 
relevant when put into context of the very poor prognosis, the deterioration in pain and other symptoms 
that is generally expected after progression (as evidence by the post-PD HRQoL analysis), the small 
population with gmBRCA pancreatic cancer, the lack of therapies with demonstrated effect in this subset, 
and the good tolerability. Also, some members pointed out quite impressive duration of survival without 
progression in some patients of about two years without the need for additional platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Delaying toxic second-line chemotherapy that is associated with very modest activity was 
in itself considered a benefit. According to this view, although direct comparison with prolonged 
chemotherapy before progression or second-line chemotherapy after progression was not available, these 
relative-efficacy considerations do not detract from the efficacy shown. An additional efficacious regimen 
in this disease with very limited options and dismal prognosis was considered a major therapeutic 
advantage at least in some patients. 
However, a minority of SAG members disagreed, and considered that the effect on PFS was too modest to 
represent a clinical benefit in the overall population. Some members also questioned why the gain in PFS 
did not translate into OS, given that dilution of the effect post-progression was considered unlikely 
considering available options. Some members also regretted that no active comparator was used and that

it was not clear what would have happened if patients in the control group would have received treatment 
with platinum salts etc. This would be important to understand the added therapeutic value of olaparib 
over available treatment options as continued chemotherapy before, or second-line treatment after 
progression. Admittedly, though, the efficacy of such regimens in this molecular subgroup is not known 
precisely although it can be assumed to be similar. They also considered that delaying subsequent 
chemotherapy, like gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel could potentially lead to loss of benefits, although the 
risks are mainly theoretical. Thus, the added value, or detriment, of olaparib over available treatment 
options was unknown. 
The internal validity is supported based on consistent results in subgroup analyses and broadly 
concordant results across efficacy endpoints, although the OS data are clearly immature. The external 
validity is corroborated by the mechanism of action and the results observed in ovarian cancer. 
The SAG agreed that the OS data were very immature, and this was unfortunate as an effect on OS 
would have been expected given the observed effect on PFS. The SAG agreed that updated/final analyses 
should be submitted given the very early cut-off especially for OS. The company has agreed to provide 
with the data in the post approval setting. 
Although the subgroup analyses showed consistent benefits by type of mutation, a comprehensive 
evaluation of other molecular markers should be conducted to better define likelihood to derive a benefit 
from treatment and further enrich the indication. To some extent, it is unclear whether the results of the 
ancillary molecular study have been exhaustively analysed and presented. It should be clarified what 
molecular analyses have been conducted in the study and what material is available for further analyses. 
Apparent under-representation of elderly patients was discussed. However, based on individual patient 
data, there were no big concerns about possible differential activity in elderly patients.  
Safety profile has been discussed as well and result of this consultation is reported in the safety section. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Olaparib in monotherapy as maintenance treatment in gBRCAm patients produced a statistically 
significant prolongation of PFS of 3.6 months on top of 3.8 months in placebo arm. OS results showed a 
non-statistically significant small difference favouring olaparib. The Applicant was recommended to 
provide updated OS and PFS2 data in the post approval setting. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Across the entire clinical programme, as of 15 December 2018, approximately 10682 patients are estimated 
to have received treatment with olaparib. The focus of this analysis is the POLO study (POLO) where olaparib 
300 mg (or placebo) bd was given as a maintenance monotherapy in the first-line maintenance treatment 
of gBRCAm patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed following 
platinum-based  chemotherapy.  Supportive  safety  data,  for  olaparib  300  mg  bd  as  a  monotherapy,  are

provided by a pool of 1329 patients who were intended to receive this dose and received olaparib in the 
Applicant-sponsored studies. 
Study 42 (pancreatic cancer patients only) 
Supportive safety data from an additional 23 patients with pancreatic cancer who were recruited in Study 
42  are  presented,  which  used  the  capsule  formulation  of  olaparib.  The  DCO  for  the  analysis  of  tumour 
response (primary analysis) for Study 42 was 31 July 2012. At the time of the DCO, the majority of patients 
in  the  pancreatic  SAS  had  discontinued  study  treatment  (21  [91.3%]  of  23  olaparib-treated  pancreatic 
cancer patients). 
Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure: POLO 
A total of 151 patients were randomised in POLO, 91 were randomised to the olaparib arm and 60 to the 
placebo arm. A higher proportion of olaparib-treated patients received treatment for a period of at least 6 
months compared with the placebo arm. 
Long term exposure to olaparib is shown in the table below  
Table 33. Overall extent of exposure in POLO (SAS) 
Duration of treatment 
The number of patients still on treatment began to diverge between arms after 3 months (in favour of 
olaparib). Duration of exposure to study treatment in POLO is summarised in Table below

lymphopenia,  leukopenia,  fatigue  and  asthenia,  nausea  and  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis,  dyspepsia, 
upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, increase in blood creatinine, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 
increased, headache, dizziness, dysgeusia, cough, hypersensitivity, dermatitis, rash, and dyspnoea.  
All the ADRs are generally of mild or moderate severity (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and rarely require treatment 
discontinuation.

Analysis of main adverse drug reactions 
Hematologic toxicities 
Anaemia 
AEs of anaemia were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm (27, 5%) compared 
with the placebo arm (16, 7%). These events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and none led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Onset of anaemia was early, generally in the first 3 months of starting olaparib (median time to first onset 
was 1.25 months; although the risk of developing anaemia remained fairly constant throughout exposure 
with no evidence of cumulative effect. AEs of anaemia were manageable by interrupting or reducing the 
olaparib dose or giving blood transfusions or other blood preparations in accordance with local practice. The 
majority of patients who developed anaemia resolved on treatment. 
Blood transfusions were reported in 16.5% of the patients treated with olaparib. No patients discontinued 
treatment due to AEs of anaemia.

In polo study, AEs of diarrhoea (single preferred term) were reported for a higher percentage of patients 
in the olaparib arm (28.6%) compared with the placebo arm (15%). These events were all Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Events of diarrhoea were generally reported early in the treatment period (median time to onset was 0.54 
months)  and  the  majority  (19  of  26  patients)  of  first  events  with  olaparib  resolved,  (median  time  to 
resolution of first event of 0.31 months.

Fatigue and asthenia 
In polo study, AEs of fatigue/asthenia were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib 
arm (60.4%) compared with the placebo arm (35%). 
These events were generally Grade 1 or 2 in severity and rarely resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. Fatigue and asthenia on olaparib treatment were generally reported early, with the majority of 
first events with olaparib reported within the first 3 months of treatment. Median time to onset was 0.49 
months.

Grouped term analysis of all abdominal pain events 
Because the incidence of upper abdominal pain (all events and CTCAE Grade 3 events) in olaparib-treated 
patients in POLO was low  an analysis used grouped term for abdominal pain was conducted (abdominal 
pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain upper and gastrointestinal pain). 
The results of this analysis showed the proportion of patients with AEs of abdominal pain (all events, CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 events) was similar for the olaparib-treated arm compared with the placebo-treated arm in POLO.

Cough 
In the POLO study, AEs of cough (grouped term consisting of cough and productive cough) were reported 
for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm (8.8%) than the placebo arm (3.3%)  
There were no CTCAE Grade 3 events in the POLO study and no AEs led to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. 
A higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm with an AE of cough received treatment for the AE (4 
[50.0%] of 8 patients) compared with no patients in the placebo arm. 
In POLO, AEs of cough (grouped term analysis) in the olaparib arm were reported throughout the study 
period (median time to first onset was 4.42 months); the majority (6 of 8 patients) of events with olaparib 
resolved (median time to resolution of first event of 0.72 months).

Adverse events of special interest 
Myelodysplastic  syndrome/acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (MDS/AML),  pneumonitis  and  new  primary 
malignancies have been classified in the RMP as important potential risks supported by pharmacovigilance 
activities. Reports for events of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies continue to be collected beyond 
30 days after the last dose of olaparib, by use of targeted safety questionnaire, and can be reported at any 
point in OS follow-up. 
Since  MDS/AML,  pneumonitis  and  new  primary  malignancies  occur  at  low  frequency,  to  improve  the 
sensitivity and precision of estimates to characterize these important potential risks, information has been 
drawn from larger pools of olaparib studies; Summaries of all reports for each safety topic up to the DCO 
of 15 December 2018 are provided in summary, these are: 
- Olaparib monotherapy all doses pool (n=2527 patients) consists of all patients who have received at least 
1 dose of olaparib as a monotherapy treatment (tablet or capsule formulation) at any dose. In addition, 23 
patients from Study 42 are included. All patients from the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose 
pool are included in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool 
- Entire clinical programme as of 15 December 2018 (n=10682 patients) This pool includes, any studies 
where  olaparib  is  given  in  combination  with  other  anticancer  treatments,  investigator-sponsored  studies 
(ISSs) and data from the managed access programme (MAP)

Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
Table 63. Summary of AEs of MDS/AML occurring across the olaparib programme shows the AEs 
of MDS/AML in the olaparib all doses monotherapy pool and across the entire olaparib clinical programme, 
and provides incidence rates. 
Table 65. Summary of AEs of MDS/AML occurring across the olaparib programme 
In POLO, there were no patients with reported events of MDS or AML in the olaparib or placebo treatment 
arms, which occurred on treatment or within the 30-day follow-up. 
The  incidence  of  events  of  MDS/AML  in  the  olaparib  arm  of  POLO  (no  events)  was  consistent  with  the 
incidence for olaparib in other studies in breast cancer (no AEs of MDS/AML were reported in the OlympiAD 
study) and lower than that seen for olaparib in studies in ovarian cancer (SOLO1 [1.9%], SOLO2 [2.1%], 
Study 19 [1.5%]) and the larger monotherapy pool population for the olaparib clinical programme (1.0%).  
Incidence rates of MDS/AML in other pivotal studies, in the olaparib all doses monotherapy pool and across 
the entire olaparib clinical programme 
Including all patients exposed to olaparib during clinical development (ie, including data from monotherapy 
studies,  blinded  studies,  combination  studies,  investigator  sponsored  studies  [ISSs]  and  the  managed 
access programme [MAP]) provides data for 10682 patients (as of 15 December 2018). In this population, 
largely composed of ovarian and breast cancer patients, there have been 64 reports of MDS/AML out of a 
total  of  10682  patients  estimated  to  have  received  olaparib  in  the  clinical  study  programme,  giving  an 
estimated cumulative incidence of 0.6% for MDS/AML. The 64 reports of MDS/AML comprise the 30 reports 
from the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool, plus reports from ongoing open label monotherapy studies, 
the ongoing MAP programme, combination studies with olaparib (including ISSs) and events from placebo-
controlled, blinded monotherapy studies. Events in patients which are still on blinded treatment have been 
considered as olaparib cases in the calculation of incidence rates.

Most of the 30 patients with events of MDS/AML in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool were receiving 
treatment for ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (n=24), with 2 other events occurring in patients 
with breast cancer. Twenty-two patients had a documented BRCA mutation, 2 patients were gBRCA wildtype 
and in 2 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
In 18 of the 30 cases of MDS/AML in the monotherapy pool a fatal outcome was reported, with MDS/AML 
noted as the primary or secondary cause of death. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who 
developed MDS/AML varied from <4.2 months to >4.9 years  
In  6  cases,  MDS/AML  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  reporting  and  in  1  case  of  chronic  myelomonocytic 
leukaemia,  outcome  was  reported  as  recovered  following  allogeneic  transplantation  320  days  after 
diagnosis. There have also been reports of MDS/AML from post marketing surveillance, consistent with the 
characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies. 
New primary malignancy  
In POLO, there were no events of new primary malignancy reported in either arm on treatment or during 
the  30-day  follow-up  period.  Two  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  reported  new  primary  malignancies  (one 
rectal cancer and one ovarian cancer) which occurred after the 30-day follow-up period. 
Table  64.  Summary  of  AEs  of  new  primary  malignancies  occurring  across  the  olaparib 
programme  shows  the  AEs  of  new  primary  malignancies  in  POLO  compared  with  other  studies  in  the 
clinical programme, and provides incidence rates. When larger populations of olaparib-treated patients are 
considered the incidence remains below 1.5%.

Pneumonitis 
AEs of pneumonitis are collected on-treatment and during the 30-day follow-up period only; there is no 
additional follow-up for pneumonitis events beyond the end of the 30-day follow up period. 
Table 67. Summary of AEs of pneumonitis occurring across the olaparib programme 
In  POLO,  there  was  1  Grade  1  pneumonitis  case  reported  in  olaparib-treated  patients  and  no  cases  in 
placebo-treated patients. 
Overall, the majority of pneumonitis AEs reported in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool were 
mild or moderate, non-serious and resolved without treatment discontinuation. None of the 15 pneumonitis 
AEs had a fatal outcome 
Pneumonitis  AEs  received  from  post-marketing  spontaneous  reports  and  other  solicited  sources  with 
olaparib  monotherapy  are  consistent  with  the  characterisation  of  the  events  reported  from  olaparib 
monotherapy clinical studies. The reports of pneumonitis from post-marketing surveillance are consistent 
with the characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies. 
A  causal  relationship  between  olaparib  treatment  and  the  development  of  pneumonitis  has  not  been 
established.  Therefore,  the  benefits  that  patients  may  expect  to  receive  from  olaparib  treatment  are 
considered to outweigh the potential risk of developing pneumonitis.

Comparative analysis of clinical laboratory evaluations 
In  general,  the  laboratory  evaluations  for  POLO  and  the  300  mg  bd  pool  were  comparable.  Changes  in 
haemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and mean corpuscular volume were the only significant 
haematological  parameters  with  clinically  relevant  changes;  these  parameters  are  recognised  ADRs  for 
olaparib.  Anaemia  is  the  only  one  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP,  whereas  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia are no longer considered as important identified risk in the RMP. 
Increase in creatinine 
Most of the laboratory values for creatinine were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 throughout the study; a single patient 
in the olaparib arm had a laboratory value of CTCAE Grade 3. 
AEs of increased creatinine were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib Arm (6.6%) 
compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (1.7%),  although  overall  numbers  were  low.  These  events  were 
predominantly Grade 1 in severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment.

Based  on  all  available  data  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  olaparib  causes  DILI.  There  were  no 
confirmed Hy’s Law cases. Two (2) (2.2%) olaparib-treated patients in POLO had suspected Hy’s law (ie, 
concurrent elevations of ALT, AST and bilirubin; see Table 34): both patients  had hepatic metastases at 
study entry, and disease progression on the same day that the abnormal hepatic enzymes were reported, 
which provides an explanation for their elevated liver enzymes.  
•Laboratory abnormalities for ALT and AST (POLO) 
In POLO, there were no patients who had CTCAE Grade 4 laboratory values for ALT and AST; the proportion 
of patients with on-treatment CTCAE Grade 3 elevations was low in both treatment arms. 
- There were 4 (4.5%) of 89 patients in the olaparib arm who had a laboratory value of ALT elevation of 
CTCAE  Grade  3  (worst  grade),  and  3  (3.4%)  of  89  patients  with  CTCAE  Grade  3  elevated  AST  during 
treatment. No liver diagnostic investigations data were reported for these 4 patients. 
- A single placebo-treated patient had on-treatment laboratory values of ALT and AST elevations of CTCAE 
Grade 3 (worst grade). 
•Concomitant elevations of ALT/AST by maximal total bilirubin (POLO) 
An  assessment  of  ALT,  AST  maximal  elevations  during  treatment  by  maximal  total  bilirubin  elevation 
showed that 6 (6.6%) patients in the olaparib arm and 4 (6.6%) patients in the placebo. 
•Laboratory abnormalities for ALT and AST (300 mg bd pool) 
In the 300 mg bd pool, 24 (1.8%) patients had an ALT increased laboratory value (worst grade) of CTCAE 
Grade 3 and 2 patients (0.2%) had an ALT increased laboratory value of CTCAE Grade 4; 33 (2.5%) patients 
had a CTCAE Grade 3 laboratory value of AST increased; no patients had an AST increased laboratory value 
of CTCAE Grade 4. The proportion of patients with these abnormal laboratory values in the 300 mg bd pool 
(1.8% and 2.5%, respectively), which was lower than that in the olaparib arm of the 
POLO study (4.5% and 3.4%, respectively); no patients in POLO had CTCAE Grade 4 abnormal laboratory 
values 
•Concomitant elevations of ALT/AST and bilirubin (300 mg bd pool) 
An assessment of combined elevations of ALT and bilirubin was conducted for all patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool.  Of  these  1329  patients,  20  patients  reported  elevations  of  both  AST  or  ALT  >3  ×  ULN  and  total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, irrespective of ALP, at any point during their study treatment

Based on all the available data there is no evidence to suggest that olaparib impairs renal function. 
The median change in creatinine from baseline to Cycle 3 for olaparib-treated patients was an increase of 
11.7 μmol/L compared with 8.8 μmol/L for placebo-treated patients. Median creatinine levels for olaparib-
treated patients then remained consistent over time (maximum median change 14.1 μmol/L, median  
change at the majority of time points between 8.8 and 13.6 μmol/L) with levels returning to baseline at the 
30 day follow-up/post follow-up visits 
Data from all patients in the 300 mg bd pool showed that a similar proportion of patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool had CTCAE grade shifts in creatinine, compared with POLO. In the 300 mg bd pool, 91.5% of olaparib-
treated patients had normal creatinine at baseline, 7.8% had CTCAE  Grade 1 at baseline and 0.5% had 
CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 1018/1325 (76.8%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade 
(changes were normal to Grade 1 in 980 of the 1018 patients) and 203/1325 (15.3%) had 2 CTCAE grade 
shifts (all were normal to Grade 2); 3 patients (0.2%) had a 3 grade shift in creatinine (from Grade 0 to 
Grade 3). 
Safety in special populations 
The 300 mg bd pool has largely been used as the data source for this section rather than POLO however, 
as the POLO study is the first Phase III study with olaparib in a tumour type that was not strongly associated 
with female patients, an analysis of AEs by patient gender in the POLO study has also been included. The 
pooled dataset includes patients with a range of solid tumours, including breast cancer.

80 mL/min) with no dose adjustment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AE leading to discontinuation (DAEs) 
In Polo, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment was higher in the Olaparib arm 
(5.5%)  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (1.7%).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment (reported for ≥2 patients) was fatigue (reported for 2 patients each [2.2%]) in the olaparib arm.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application for a new indication in patients with pancreatic cancer is supported by safety data from a 
randomised POLO study in which 91 patients received olaparib in tablet formulation at a dose of 300 mg 
bd  and  60  patients  –  placebo.  This  comparative  data  remains  limited  in  the  intended  indication  and  is 
supported by non-comparative data in 12 patients with pancreatic cancer recruited in Phase I/II studies. 
This safety data in pancreatic cancer patients have been compared with pooled safety data with tablet 
formulation at a dose of 300 mg bd as a monotherapy from additional 12 monotherapy studies providing 
a database of about 1329 patients (101 of whom had pancreatic cancer). 
Supportive safety data from an additional 23 patients with pancreatic cancer who were recruited in Study 
42 are submitted, which used the capsule formulation. This study was a Phase II, open-label, basket study 
of olaparib capsules 400 mg oral bd as treatment of patients with gBRCAm malignancies across multiple 
tumour types. The 23 patients in the pancreatic cancer cohort had to have either failed or be unsuitable for 
gemcitabine treatment in the advanced setting. 
Taking into account the small number of patients in the pancreatic cohort of Study 42, the differences in 
patient population and the inherent limitations on interpretation of safety information from a single arm 
study, the safety data for the 23 patients with pancreatic cancer in Study 42 are generally supportive of 
the safety profile of olaparib patients with pancreatic cancer in the POLO study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020

Across the entire clinical programme, as of 15 December 2018, an estimated 10682 patients have received 
treatment with olaparib. 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib observed in POLO study was consistent with previously reported 
profile for the olaparib tablet formulation. 
Safety findings in POLO and tablet pooled safety datasets 
• 
• 
The majority of patients exposed to olaparib reported adverse events (AEs), which were generally 
mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation. The toxicity of olaparib was thus 
most often manageable, including by dose interruptions, dose reductions and standard supportive 
treatment as required. The safety findings in olaparib arm of POLO were consistent with the 300 
mg bd pool. 
The median total treatment duration to olaparib was approximately 1.6 times longer than duration 
of exposure to placebo (approximately 6.0 months) compared with the placebo arm (approximately 
3.7  months).  Overall,  25.3%  of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  remained  on  treatment  for  ≥1  year 
compared  with  6.7%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  Compared  with  the  olaparib  arm  of  POLO, 
median treatment duration in the 300 mg bd pool was generally longer, due to the large number 
of  patients  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  recruited  in  ovarian  cancer  studies  where  time  to  disease 
progression and hence treatment duration is longer than for pancreatic cancer. 
• 
The majority of AEs occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. The most common (reported 
by ≥20% of patients) AEs in the olaparib arm were fatigue (45.1%), nausea (45.1%), diarrhoea 
(28.6%), abdominal pain (28.6%), anaemia (27.5%), decreased appetite (25.3%) and constipation 
(23.1%).  These  results  were  numerically  similar  for  the  300  mg  bd  pool  population;  except  for 
nausea (63.1%), vomiting (35.1%), abdominal pain (17.8%) and anaemia (38.6%). 
•  Dose interruptions or delay and dose reductions were reported respectively in 41.8% patients on 
olaparib and 16.7% placebo patients. 
• 
The proportion of patients who reported AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment was low in both 
treatment arms and was higher in the olaparib arm (5.5%) compared with the placebo arm (1.1%). 
Fatigue (2.2%) was the only AEs leading to discontinuation of olaparib in more than one patient in 
the olaparib arm. 
•  Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence in the olaparib arm (39.6% of the patients) than in the placebo 
arm (23.3%). Anaemia was the only AEs Grade ≥3 reported in ≥5% of patients in the olaparib arm 
(reported in 11% of olaparib arm versus 3.3% of placebo arm). AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher 
were similar and occurred at similar frequencies in olaparib between treatment arm of POLO and 
the 300 mg bd pool (17, 2%). 
•  SAEs were reported in 24.2% (22/91 patients) of the olaparib-arm compared to 15% (9/60) of the 
placebo  arm.  The  most  common  reported  SAE  was  anemia  (6.6%  olaparib  vs  0%  placebo).  The 
highest  frequency  of  reported  SAEs  at  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  level  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders (11% olaparib vs. 3% placebo) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (6.6% olaparib 
vs.1.7%  placebo).  The  most  common  SAE  in  both  arms  was  abdominal  pain  (3.3%  olaparib  vs 
1.7% placebo), vomiting (1.1% olaparib vs 5.0% placebo) and cholangitis (2.2% vs 1.7%). The 
majority of SAEs had resolved with either no action taken or following a temporary dose interruption 
or delay/dose change or were recovering. SAEs were reported at a similar frequency in POLO and 
in the 300 mg bd pooled dataset.

•  Most deaths occurring on study were related to the disease under investigation. A total of 3 patients 
died with causes unrelated to disease progression: one duodenal perforation, one refractory septic 
shock  and  one  unknown  cause.  All  3  patients  were  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  in  all  cases,  death 
occurred after the patient had discontinued olaparib treatment and completed the 30-day follow up 
period.  The  frequency  of  deaths  for  any  reason  was  similar  for  olaparib-treated  patients  over 
patients in the placebo arm (44.6% vs. 48.4% respectively). The frequency of deaths for any reason 
was higher for olaparib-treated patients (44.6%) in POLO over the 300 mg bd pool (27.5%).  
• 
The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified for olaparib tablets are the same as before described 
in the SmPC of olaparib (ie, anaemia; neutropenia; leukopenia; thrombocytopenia; lymphopenia; 
fatigue  and  asthenia;  nausea  and  vomiting;  diarrhoea;  dyspepsia;  stomatitis;  upper  abdominal 
pain;  decreased  appetite;  dizziness;  headache;  dysgeusia;  cough;  dyspnoea  increase  in  blood 
creatinine; mean corpuscular volume elevation; rash; hypersensitivity; and dermatitis).  
•  Anaemia  appears  as  the  most  prominent  AE  among  Grade  ≥3,  SAEs  and  events  leading  to  dose 
adjustments.  Haematological  toxicity  overall  was  similar  to  other  indications.    As  regards 
concomitant treatment, 15 (16.5%) patients in the olaparib arm received at least 1 blood or PBRC 
transfusion.    The  majority  of  patients  received  ≤3  transfusions;  however,  1  patient  received  18 
PBRC transfusions over a 7 month period.  One (1.1%) olaparib-treated patient had treatment with 
an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  (epoetin  beta).  In  the  placebo  arm  of  POLO,  no  patients 
received a blood transfusion or other antianaemic preparation on treatment or treatment with an 
erythropoiesis stimulating agent. 
• 
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  for  olaparib  are  Myelodysplastic  syndrome 
(MDS)/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies. Investigators in POLO were required to 
record  MDS/AML  and  new  primary  malignancies  events  beyond  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of 
olaparib  at  any  point  in  OS  follow-up.  A  causal  relationship  between  olaparib treatment  and  the 
development or acceleration of MDS/AML, new primary malignancies and pneumonitis has not been 
established. 
o  There were no reports of MDS or AML in either treatment arm of POLO, either on treatment, 
or  within  the  30-day  follow-up  period.  The  incidence  of  MDS/AML  AEs  The  incidence  of 
MDS/AML AEs, in the pool of patients who received olaparib in monotherapy studies (tablet 
and capsule formulations; all doses of olaparib) showed an incidence of 1.2% for olaparib 
(30 patients with AEs of MDS/AML in a total of 2527 patients). 
o  There were no reports of new primary malignancies in POLO. The incidence of new primary 
malignancies in the pool of patients who received olaparib in monotherapy studies (tablet 
and capsule formulations; all doses of olaparib) is 1.4% for olaparib (35 patients in a total 
of 2527 patients, of whom 12 patients had skin cancers. The non-skin cancer events were 
essentially:  breast  cancers  (n=9),  gastrointestinal  (GI)  cancers  (n=5),  thyroid  cancer 
(n=2), plasma cell myeloma (n=2), lung cancer (n=2), and other (n= 3)).  
o 
In  POLO,  1  event  of  pneumonitis  was  reported  (1.1%  incidence).  The  incidence  for  the 
pooled  data  of  olaparib  in  monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose  (N=2095  olaparib-
treated patients) is 0.7%. These events were mild or moderate, non-serious and resolved 
without treatment discontinuation; none of them had a fatal outcome. 
•  Regarding to laboratory parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 135/147 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
o  Changes  in  the  laboratory  values  for  the  haematology  parameters  of  haemoglobin, 
neutrophils,  platelets  and lymphocytes  showed  a  decrease  on olaparib  treatment.  At  the 
exception  of  anaemia  and  neutropenia  (see  above,  paragraph  on  AEs  grade  ≥  3)  these 
changes were reported in low numbers of patients with a maximum CTCAE Grade of 3 or 4 
(leukopenia 2.6%, neutrophil count 2.3%, % and platelet count decreased 2.3%). These 
changes in haematological parameters are generally mild or moderate, manageable, and 
reversible. 
o 
Increases  in  creatinine  have  been  identified  as  an  ADR  with  olaparib  treatment.  AEs  of 
increased creatinine were predominantly Grade 1 in  severity and none led to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. The lab observations of elevated serum creatinine were not 
associated with renal impairment and had apparently no clinical sequelae. 
o  No hepatobiliary or renal safety concerns were identified from a review of laboratory and 
AE data. 
•  Special  populations:  Although  there  are  limited  data  in  elderly  patients  ≥ 75  years  of  age, 
assessment of the safety of olaparib in patient subgroups has demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile regardless of age, race, gender, or body weight. No dose adjustment is required on the basis 
of patient age, racial origin, and gender or body weight.  
Additional expert consultations 
After consultation with Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology the toxicity is considered generally 
manageable given the low frequency of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. The toxicity profile is 
well characterised based on extensive experience in the breast and ovarian cancer settings. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib tablet formulation is considered acceptable for the intended population. 
In  a  relatively  limited  number  of  gBRCAm  patients  with  metastatic  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma,  olaparib 
had a safety profile similar to other previously approved indications and pooled safety data. 
Nevertheless,  its  tolerability  profile  in  terms  of  substantial  proportion  of  dose  adjustments  should  be 
considered in the context of a maintenance therapy and patients experiencing ADRs need to be carefully 
followed by physicians . 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 18.3 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed this 
advice without changes. 
The  olaparib  RMP  covers  both  the  Capsules  and  Tablet  formulations,  however  the  addition  of  a  new 
therapeutic indication has been proposed only for the Tablet licence, for the hard capsules the variation 
modifies the safety information only, by incorporating the pooled olaparib safety data.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections  4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1of the SmPC have been updated to 
include data on the new claimed indication in pancreatic cancer.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable because the changes to the package 
leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The purpose of the current submission was to seek marketing approval for olaparib as monotherapy for 
the maintenance treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2- mutations who have metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas whose disease has not progressed after a minimum of 16 weeks on first-
line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to clinical guidelines for pancreatic cancer (NCCN GL v1.2020 and ESMO 2015), metastatic 
patients with good PS (ECOG 0-2) are eligible for at least 4-6 months of chemotherapy. In the presence 
of known BRCA 1/2 mutations, preferred regimens are FOLFIRINOX or modified FOLFIRINOX or 
Gemcitabine + cisplatin (recommendation category 2A - NCCN GL v1.2020 for pancreatic cancer). 
Currently, there is no approved therapy indicated for the first line maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer specifically in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on results from the Study D081FC00001 (POLO): A Phase III, Randomised, 
Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicentre Study of Maintenance Olaparib Monotherapy in Patients 
with gBRCA Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer whose Disease Has Not Progressed on First-Line 
Platinum-Based Chemotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
POLO demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by BICR in FAS population, with HR of 
0.531,  95%  IC  0.346  –  0.815,  p-value  0.0038.  The  median  of  PFS  showed  a  difference  of  3.6  months 
favouring  olaparib  arm  (7.4  months  vs.  3.8  months).  The  sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS  by  investigator 
assessment (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.34, 0.78;  p=0.0017; median PFS 6.3 months vs 3.7 months for olaparib 
vs  placebo, respectively)  was consistent with the PFS analysis by BICR.   Other sensitivity analyses were 
also consistent with the BICR assessment of PFS,  supporting the robustness of the primary analysis. 
A higher proportion of patients in olaparib arm reached a response (CR or PR as BoR) (19.6% - 18/92) 
compared to placebo arm (9.7% - 6/62). Most of these responses were PR in both arms (17.4% - 16/92 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 140/147 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
vs 9.7% - 6/62, olaparib vs. placebo, respectively). CR was reached by two patients (2.2%) in the olaparib 
arm compared to none in the placebo arm (0.0%). 
A higher rate of ORR by BICR was seen in the olaparib arm compared to placebo arm (23.1% vs 11.5%). 
A longer duration of the response in olaparib arm (24.9 months, n=18) compared to placebo arm (3.7 
months, n=6) was reported. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In line with clinical practice, the study population enrolled is heterogeneous with regard to types of first-
line chemotherapy regimens, the duration of treatment with platinum and other components and potential 
reasons for their discontinuation (unacceptable toxicity, completion of the planned number of cycles, patient 
choice). Patients who could tolerate complete platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen until progression 
have  not  been  consequently  considered  for  olaparib/placebo  treatment  necessitating  interruption  of 
successive chemotherapy courses. 
OS  results  did  not  show  a  statistical  significance  at 46%  maturity  with  a  HR  of  0.906  (95%  IC  0.563  – 
1.457, p value = 0.6833, median OS of 18.9 months vs 18.1 for olaparib vs. placebo). It is unlikely that 
further maturation of the data would result in substantial OS gain. In this context, the supportive value of 
OS data remains limited. 
In terms of PFS2, similar proportion of patients in both arms presented a second progression (44.6% vs. 
48.4%). Results for PFS2 showed a HR of 0.755 (95% CI 0.464 - 1.230, p value = 0.2597, median 13.2 
months for olaparib and 9.2 months for placebo), indicating that olaparib treatment effect is preserved at 
least during the first subsequent line of treatment. 
Although  no  statistically  significant  improvement  could  be  shown  for  PFS2  and  OS,  numerically  higher 
median estimates have been observed in the olaparib arm at this timepoint.  
Final analysis of OS and PFS2 data will become available in Q4 2020. 
There are few long-term survivors that appeared to derive benefit from olaparib maintenance treatment 
but characteristics of these patients could not be identified based on the analyses conducted. Therefore, 
the MAH is recommended to further investigate tissue biomarkers to better define patients with likelihood 
to derive a benefit from treatment.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib is well characterised.  
The  safety  profile  of  olaparib  in  the  proposed  first-line  maintenance  indication  is  based  mainly  from  the 
phase III POLO Study where patients were dosed olaparib (or placebo) 300 mg bd as a monotherapy. The 
POLO data have been pooled with the data from patients receiving olaparib 300 mg bd tablet in additional 
12  monotherapy  studies  providing  a  pooled  safety  database  about  1329  patients  (101  of  whom  had 
pancreatic cancer). 
The most common (reported by ≥20% of patients) AEs in the olaparib arm were fatigue (45.1%), nausea 
(45.1%), diarrhoea (28.6%), abdominal pain (28.6%), anaemia (27.5%), decreased appetite (25.3%) and 
constipation (23.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/195425/2020 
Page 141/147 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Grade ≥3 AEs had a higher incidence in the olaparib arm (39.6% of the patients) than in the placebo arm 
(23.3%). Anaemia was the only AEs Grade ≥3 reported in ≥5% of patients in the olaparib arm (reported in 
11% of olaparib arm versus 3.3% of placebo arm). 
SAEs were reported in 24.2% (22/91 patients) of the olaparib-arm compared 15% (9/60) of the placebo 
arm. The most common reported SAE was anaemia (6.6% olaparib vs. 0% placebo). The highest frequency 
of reported SAEs at the system organ class (SOC) level were gastrointestinal disorders (11% olaparib vs. 
3% placebo) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (6.6% olaparib vs.1.7% placebo). 
The  median  total  treatment  duration  to  olaparib  was  approximately  1.6  times  longer  than  duration  of 
exposure  to  placebo  (approximately  6.0  months)  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (approximately  3.7 
months). Overall, 25.3% of patients in the olaparib arm remained on treatment for ≥1 year compared with 
6.7% of patients in the placebo arm.  
Dose interruptions or delay and dose reductions were reported respectively in 41.8% patients on olaparib 
and 16.7% placebo patients. 
One olaparib treated patient developed an AE of duodenal perforation during the 30 day follow-up period 
which became fatal after the DCO for the analysis. 
Anaemia appears as the most prominent AE among Grade ≥3, SAEs and events leading to dose adjustments. 
Haematological  toxicity  overall  was  similar  to  other  indications.    As  regards  concomitant  treatment,  15 
(16.5%) patients in the olaparib arm received at least 1 blood or PBRC transfusion.  The majority of patients 
received ≤3 transfusions; however, 1 patient received 18 PBRC transfusions over a 7 month period.  One 
(1.1%) olaparib-treated patient had treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (epoetin beta). In 
the  placebo  arm  of  POLO,  no  patients  received  a  blood  transfusion  or  other  antianaemic  preparation  on 
treatment or treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. 
There were no cases of AML/MDS reported on treatment or 30 days after treatment.  
It was reported that 1 (1.1%) patients in the olaparib arm and no patients in the placebo arm had an AE 
of pneumonitis on treatment and no patients had AEs of pneumonitis in the post-follow-up period. This AE 
did not require modification of the olaparib dose and no treatment was given. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The most important uncertainties about unfavourable effects are related to the risk of AML/MDS, new 
primary malignancies and pneumonitis, which will continue to be closely monitored (especially relevant 
for long-survivors). Data for long-term exposure remain limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The maintenance treatment for a metastatic pancreatic cancer is a new paradigm. PFS results showed a 
47% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib than with placebo in rare selected patients 
with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. This gain in PFS could be considered meaningful taking into account the 
natural evolution of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. PFS2 results were supportive of the PFS 
results  showing  numerically  positive  trend  with  4  months  PFS2  gain  in  the  olaparib  arm  at  the  time  of 
assessment. OS results showed a non-statistically significant small difference favouring olaparib. 
Overall,  olaparib  was  well  tolerated  with  a  manageable  safety  profile  which  is  sufficiently  characterised, 
although  data  for  long-term  safety  remain  limited.  While  ADRs  of  hematologic  and  lymphatic  system 
occurred  at  a  high  frequency,  they  are  generally  of  low  grade  and  easily  manageable.  Safety  results  of 
POLO  seem  to  be  in  line  with  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  from  other  studies  and  post-marketing 
information. Measures to minimize the risk are well addressed in the RMP submitted by the MAH.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
To support the new intended indication of olaparib:

Lynparza  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  germline 
BRCA1/2-mutations who have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and have not progressed after 
a minimum of 16 weeks of platinum treatment within a first-line chemotherapy regimen. 
clinical data from POLO study were submitted.  
Related to results, a statistically significant gain in median PFS of 3.6 months was shown and supported by 
a positive trend in PFS2 outcome. OS results showed a non-statistical significant small difference favouring 
olaparib.  Considering  the  manageable  safety  profile,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  benefits  outweigh  the 
risks.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by a majority of 26 out of 30 votes, the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation, concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to support the use of Lynparza tablets (100mg and 150 mg) for the maintenance 
treatment of gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the results from the pivotal Phase 3 study, 
POLO; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update section 4.8 for lynparza hard capsules (50 mg) to revise list of ADR based on the pooled safety 
data analysis. The RMP version 18.3 has also been submitted. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with 
the latest guideline regarding the sodium content. The MAH also took the occasion to include some minor 
editorial changes in the PI. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lynparza is not similar to Onivyde pegylated liposomal 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 May 2020 
Lynparza EMEA/H/C/003726/II/0033 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the    granting  of  an  extension  of  indication  for  Lynparza  Tablets  (100mg  and  150mg)  indicated  as 
monotherapy  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  germline  BRCA1/2-mutations  who 
have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and have not progressed after a minimum of 16 weeks 
of platinum treatment within a first-line chemotherapy regimen. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Considering the patient population and the treatment setting at hand, i.e. the maintenance setting in 
BRCA mutated pancreas carcinoma, we consider that benefit should be shown in terms of OS. Such data 
have  not  been  provided.  As  a  consequence,  while  the  safety  profile  is  deemed  manageable,  clinical 
efficacy cannot be considered established and the B/R is negative.

cholecystitis. In controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of 
LEMTRADA-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous 
cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with 
INFB-1a. During postmarketing use, additional cases of 
acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in 
LEMTRADA-treated patients. Symptoms of acute acalculous 
cholecystitis include abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, 
fever, nausea, and vomiting. Acute acalculous cholecystitis 
is a condition that may be associated with high morbidity 
and mortality rates if not diagnosed early and treated. If 
acute acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, evaluate and 
treat promptly.

Genzyme-Sponsored Studies of Alemtuzumab 
(ongoing at the time of the initial MAA) to evaluate 
the long term safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in 
MS patients who received alemtuzumab during 
previous company-sponsored studies. The RMP 
version 3.0 has also been submitted. The PL has 
been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder

in MS patients who received additional treatment courses of 
alemtuzumab. The update in the posology includes the 
option for a third and fourth treatment course with 
alemtuzumab if needed. If an additional course is 
administered, safety-follow up should be continued until 48 
months after the last infusion. Updated safety information 
on immune thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), thyroid 
disorders, infusion-associated reactions and infections has 
been included.

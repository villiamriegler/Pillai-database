1.  Introduction 
The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 
1901/2006. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  the  final  clinical  study  report  of  a  recently  completed  phase  IV 
retrospective observational study (CBC134A2403; EUCORESM) sponsored by Novartis. This study was 
conducted in 18 countries and enrolled 6,075 patients, including 81 paediatric patients. The purpose of 
this  study  was  to  collect  real-world  data  on  the  use  and  clinical  outcomes  for  patients  who  received 
Cubicin.  
This  study  was  not  designed  for  studying  the  paediatric  population  specifically.  Cubicin  is  not 
approvedfor  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  however  some  guidelines  recommend  its  use  for 
managing  MRSA  bacteremia,  infective  IE,  acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis,  and  septic  arthritis  in 
pediatric patients. 
The  applicant  had  previously  submitted  a  Critical  Expert  Overview  to  review  the  available  paediatric 
results from this study, which was assessed in Dec 2014. No new safety concerns have arisen during 
this study. 
About the product 
Daptomycin  is  a  cyclic  lipopeptide  natural  product  that  is  active  against  Gram  positive  bacteria  only. 
The  mechanism  of  action  involves  binding  to  bacterial  membranes  of  both  growing  and  stationary 
phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. 
This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis. 
Daptomycin  pharmacokinetics  are  generally  linear  and  time-independent  at  doses  of  4  to  12  mg/kg 
administered  as  a  single  daily  dose  by  30-minute  intravenous  infusion  for  up  to  14  days  in  healthy 
volunteers. Steady state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose. Daptomycin is eliminated 
primarily by the kidney. 
Cubicin was first authorised via the centralised route in 2006. 
Approved indication(s) and posology 
Indication 
Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults: 
- Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI).  
- Right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus.  
- Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) when associated with RIE or with cSSTI. 
Posology 
Adults 
- cSSTI without concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: Cubicin 4 mg/kg is administered once 
every 24 hours for 7-14 days or until the infection is resolved  
-  cSSTI  with  concurrent  Staphylococcus  aureus  bacteraemia:  Cubicin  6  mg/kg  is  administered  once 
every 24 hours. The duration of therapy may  need to be longer than 14 days  in accordance with the 
perceived risk of complications in the individual patient.

- Known or suspected right-sided infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus: Cubicin 6 mg/kg 
is  administered  once  every  24  hours.  The  duration  of  therapy  should  be  in  accordance  with  available 
official recommendations. .  
In patients with renal impairment, dose adjustment is needed. 
Paediatric population 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Cubicin  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  below  18  years  has  not  been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 of the SPC but no recommendation on 
posology are made. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that this study is a stand-alone study. 
EUCORE was a non-interventional, multicenter, retrospective, patient registry designed to collect real-
world outcome data on patients who had received at least one dose of daptomycin for the treatment of 
a serious Gram-positive bacterial infection. 
Annual  database  locks  occurred  from  2008  to  2014.  Data  collected  until  September  15  of  each  year 
(2008 and 2009) or until July 31 (2010 to 2012) were included in these analyses as well as in the final 
study analysis (2014). These data originated from patients who had completed daptomycin treatment 
at least 1 month before the end of the collection period and thus had been followed up for 30 days. 
The study was designed to allow all sites at which patients had been treated with daptomycin and all 
countries in which Novartis is the MAH for Cubicin to participate. The study was not restricted to adult 
patients, thus it was open for the collection of data from paediatric patients as well. 
Rapporteurs comments:  
The dosages used with in this study for the paediatric patients have not been mentioned. It is assumed 
the  dosage  used  were  the  same  as  those  used  in  the  three  PK  studies  conducted  previously  in 
paediatric patients and submitted to EMA:  
DAP-PEDS-05-01  (2007):  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  a  single  dose  of  daptomycin  (4 
mg/kg) in paediatric patients aged two to seventeen years. 
DAP-PEDS-07-02:  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of 
daptomycin (8 and 10 mg/kg) in paediatric subjects aged two to six years. 
DAP-PEDS-09-01:  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of 
daptomycin (4 and 6 mg/kg) in paediatric subjects aged three months to twenty four months.  
As the final report is expected very shortly (Jan 2015), the applicant should provide full details of the 
dosages used, in that report.  
The Rapporteur will await the submission of these data.

1.2.  Clinical aspects 
Study population 
A total of 81 paediatric patients were included in this registry study. The majority of paediatric patients 
were male (65.4%), adolescents (56.8%) and Caucasian (92.5%). 
Demographics 
The  most  common  primary  infections  were  bacteraemia  (19.8%)  and  cSSTI  (18.5%),  followed  by 
osteomyelitis (13.6%), endocarditis (12.3%) and foreign body/prosthetic infection (12.3%). The main 
reason  for  switching  treatment  from  a  previous  antibiotic  to  daptomycin  was  failure  of  the  previous 
antibiotic  treatment.  Staphylococcus  aureus  was  the  most  common  primary  pathogen  (23.8% 
methicillin-resistant, 66.7% methicillin-susceptible and 9.5% methicillin susceptibility unknown). 
Efficacy data 
Overall  clinical  success  rates  were  similar  in  patients  treated  with  daptomycin  either  as  first  line 
(93.7%) or second line (92.0%) treatment. The clinical success rate (cured plus improved) was 100%

for  endocarditis,  osteomyelitis  and  uSSTI;  94.4%  for  bacteraemia;  76.9%  for  cSSTI;  and  89.5%  for 
other infections. 
Safety data 
Patient exposure (Pediatric patients) 
A total of 81 pediatric patients received at least 1 dose of daptomycin therapy, and the median dose of 
daptomycin was 6.0 mg/kg (range 4.0-18.5 mg/kg). The most frequently prescribed initial dose was 6 
mg/kg (45.7%). An initial dose of 4 mg/kg was administered in 18.5% of patients. Other initial doses 
given to the remaining 35.8% of patients included ≥8 mg/kg to ≤10 mg/kg (13.6%), >6 mg/kg to <8 
mg/kg (11.1%) and >10 mg/kg (6.2%).

Table. Initial dose for pediatric patients (Safety population) N=81n (%) 
Median duration of therapy was 12.5 days (1-47 days). 
Safety  assessments  consisted  of  all  AEs,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  with  their  severity  and 
relationship  to  study  drug,  and  regular  assessments  of  physical  condition,  vital  signs,  weight,  and 
laboratory parameters. Safety analysis included all patients given at least 1 dose of the study drug. 
Six  (7.4%)  out  of  81  paediatric  patients  reported  adverse  events  (rash  (2),  tachycardia  (1), 
anaphylactic  reaction  (1),  hypersensitivity  (1),  increased  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (1), 
osteosarcoma  (1),  acute  renal  failure  (1),  dyspnoea  (1),  and  pulmonary  haemorrhage  (1).  Four 
patients  had  an  increase  in  CPK  levels  but  none  of  these  patients  reported  myopathy  related  AEs. 
Three  patients  had  SAEs  that  led  to  pemanent  disontinuation  of  study  drug  (anaphylactic  reaction, 
pulmonary  haemorrhage  and  death,  acute  renal  failure).  One  patient  died  but  the  death  was 
considered not related to daptomycin. 
Rapporteurs comments:  
Although Cubicin is not approved for use in children, some off-label use is taking place. The doses used 
vary but the most common is 6mg/kg (as recommended in the IDSA guideline,2011). No new adverse 
events  of  concern  were  identified  and  the  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  patients  in  this  study  were 
consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin.

1.2.1.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  applicant  had  previously  submitted  only  a  clinical  overview  to  provide  an  update.  The  full  study 
report has been provided now. 
There  were  no  new  or  unexpected  safety  findings  from  the  81  paediatric  patients  enrolled  in  study 
CBC134A2403 (EUCORE). Both safety and efficacy results are consistent with those from adult patients 
obtained in this and previous clinical trials and with data from the literature. 
On  the  basis  of  the  paediatric  results  of  study  CBC134A2403,  there  is  no  change  in  the  benefit-risk 
profile of Cubicin for the existing indications. The clinical safety and efficacy findings remain consistent 
with  the  information  in  the  Novartis  Core  Data  Sheet  and  prescribing  information  for  Cubicin. 
Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the results of this study at present. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The  benefit/risk  balance  remains  positive  in  the  approved  indications  at  present  and  no 
further  regulatory  action  is  proposed  at  this  stage  relating  to  the  (off-label)  use  in  the 
paediatric population.

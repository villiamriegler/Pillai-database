2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Mycophenolate  mofetil  Teva  500  mg  film  coated  tablet  and  250  mg  hard  capsule  is  a  generic 
medicinal product containing mycophenolate mofetil as active substance.  
The  active  metabolite  of  mycophenolate  mofetil,  mycophenolic  acid  (MPA),  is  a  selective,  non-
competitive,  reversible  inhibitor  of  inosine  monophosphate  dehydrogenase,  resulting  in  a  potent 
inhibition  of  guanosine  nucleotide  synthesis.  Due  to  its  potent  cytostatic  effect  on  lymphocytes,  the 
indication  is  in  combination  with  ciclosporin  and  corticosteroids  for  the  prophylaxis  of  acute 
transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
The efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in randomised, double-blind 
comparative  studies  in  patients  receiving  allogeneic  renal,  cardiac  or  hepatic  transplants,  for 
prophylaxis  of  acute  transplant  rejection.  A  summary  of  these  studies  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  of 
CellCept. 
The  indication  proposed  for  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  the  same  as  authorized  for  the  reference 
medicinal product CellCept. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva is presented in the form of film coated tablets and hard capsules. 
The  capsules  contain  250  mg  of  mycophenolate  mofetil  as  active  substance.  Other  ingredients  are 
defined in the SPC section 6.1. 
The  film  coated  tablets  contain  500  mg  of  mycophenolate  mofetil  as  active  substance.  Other 
ingredients are defined in the SPC section 6.1. 
Tablets and capsules are packaged into blisters made of transparent PVC/PVDC/Al.  
Active Substance 
The  chemical  name  of  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  2-(Morpholin-4-yl)ethyl  (4E)-6-(4-hydroxy-6-
methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yl)-4-methylhex-4-enoate.  It  is  a  white  to  off-
white,  not  hygroscopic  crystalline  powder,  practically  insoluble  in  water.  It  does  not  show 
polymorphism. Mycophenolate mofetil is described in Ph Eur. 
• 
Manufacture 
The applicant refers to two ASMFs. Drug substance by the second supplier may be manufactured by 
two different manufacturers. 
Mycophenolate  mofetil  sourced  from  the  first  ASMF  holder  is  prepared  from  mycophenolic  methyl 
ester  which  is  prepared  from  mycophenolic  acid  (MPA).  MPA  used  in  the  manufacture  of 
mycophenolate mofetil is manufactured by fermentation using appropriate and defined  fungi strains. 
Sufficient  information  on  the  inoculum  media,  fermentation  media  and  the  purification  of  MPA  is 
provided. The validation data of the manufacturing process and the specifications for all raw materials 
and mycophenolate mofetil are provided and considered satisfactory. 
Mycophenolate mofetil sourced from the second ASMF holder is obtained from two similar synthetic 
routes.  In  brief,  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  prepared  from  mycophenolic  acid  by  condensation  with 
morpholine-2-ethanol in the presence of catalyst to yield crude mycophenolate mofetil which is then 
purified, recrystallised and dried to yield the active substance. MPA is manufactured by fermentation 
5/22

using  appropriate  and  defined  fungi  strains.  Sufficient  information  on  the  inoculum  media, 
fermentation media and the purification of MPA are provided.  
Satisfactory process validation data for batches from both sites are provided. The specification limits 
for  all  raw  materials  and  mycophenolate  mofetil  have  been  provided  and  are  also  considered 
satisfactory. 
In  summary,  sufficient  information  has  been  provided  to  demonstrate  that  active  substance 
manufacture from both sources are equivalent in all relevant quality attributes. 
• 
Specification 
The drug substance specification as tested by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for 
Appearance (Visual), Identification (PhEur), Appearance of solution (PhEur), Loss on drying (PhEur), 
Heavy metals (PhEur), Sulphated ash (Ph.Eur), Related substances (PhEur), Assay (PhEur), Residual 
solvents (GC), Particle size (laser diffraction). In addition the drug substance sourced from the second 
supplier is tested for Bulk and Tapped Density. 
The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance and were found to be 
adequate to control the quality of the active substance.  
Batch  analysis  data  of  three  batches  of  active  substance  from  each  manufacturer  are  provided.  The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
• 
Stability 
Long-term and accelerated stability data for three pilot and commercial batches from the first supplier 
up to 24 months and 18 months respectively in line with ICH guidance were presented. Accelerated 
data  was  presented  for  all  batches  used  in  long-term  stability  studies  up  to  6  months.  All  data  are 
within specifications. 
The  proposed  re-test  period  is  justified  based  on  the  stability  results  when  the  active  substance  is 
stored in the original packing material. 
Drug substance by the second supplier may be manufactured by two different manufacturers. 
Long-term  stability  data  for  up  to  18  months  in  line  with  ICH  guidance  were  presented  for  seven 
batches manufactured at the first site. Accelerated data was presented for all batches used in long-term 
stability studies up to 6 months. 
Long-term and accelerated stability data were presented for up to 6 months in line with ICH guidance 
for three batches manufactured at the second site. 
All stability data, including impurities from the two manufacturing sites are well within specifications. 
The  proposed  re-test  period  is  justified  based  on  the  stability  results  when  the  active  substance  is 
stored in the original packing material.

The  aim  of  the  development  was  to  obtain  immediate  release  capsules  containing  qualitatively  and 
quantitatively the same drug substance as the reference product, CellCept 250mg capsules, and exhibit 
the same bioavailability. 
The excipients selected are commonly used for the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations. These 
are pregelatinised starch (filler), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), povidone (K-90F) (binder) and 
magnesium  stearate  (lubricant).  A  satisfactory  declaration  that  the  printing  ink  complies  with  the 
Directive  95/45/EC  is  provided.  Appropriate  certificates  of  suitability  were  also  provided  for  the 
gelatin used in the capsules shell. 
Comparative dissolution profiles were generated for the reference biobatch (CellCept 250mg capsules) 
and test biobatch. The chosen dissolution conditions are the most discriminative. 
Bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  for  both  the  250  mg  strength  (capsules)  and  the  500  mg 
strength (tablets) under fasting and fed conditions. Plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid were 
determined  using  a  validated  LCMS  method  in  bioavailability  studies.  The  method  is  valid  with 
respect to specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, range, LOD /LOQ and robustness. 
The  capsule  impurity  profile  of  the  biobatch  is  very  similar  to  the  reference  biobatch.  Satisfactory 
certificates of analysis for the reference biobatch and test biobatch were provided. 
The  product  is  intended  to  be  packed  in  PVC/PVdC/Al  blisters.  The  suitability  of  the  packaging 
system was determined in the stability studies.

Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the 
time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve 
this as Follow-Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
2.3  Non Clinical aspects   
The  proposed  products  are  Mycophenolate  mofetil  Teva  500  mg  film  coated  tablet  and  250  mg 
capsule  claiming  to  be  generic  products  of  CellCept®  500  mg  tablets  and  250  mg  capsules  (Roche 
Registration Ltd), respectively.  
Pharmacology 
The active substance mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (a 
fermentation product of several Penicillium species). Mycophenolic acid is a selective, uncompetitive 
and  reversible  inhibitor  of  inosine  monophosphate  dehydrogenase  (IMPDH).  Inhibition  of  IMPDH 
leads to selective inhibition of B and T lymphocyte cell types. Inhibition of B and T lymphocytes has 
been  used  to  provide  immunosuppression  for  the  prevention  of  acute  rejection  in  patients  receiving 
allogenic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
The original products are listed as CellCept® 500 mg tablets and 250 mg capsules which were 
authorised in February 1996 in the EU. 
Pharmacokinetics/Toxicology 
The pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of mycophenolate mofetil are well 
known.  As  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  a  well  known  active  substance,  no  further  studies  are  required 
and the applicant has provided none. An overview based on a literature review is thus appropriate. 
2.4  Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
Mycophenolate mofetil belongs to the immunosuppressant group. Its active metabolite, mycophenolic 
acid (MPA), is a potent inhibitor of guanosine nucleotide synthesis. Due to its potent cytostatic effect 
on lymphocytes, the indication is in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the 
prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic 
transplants.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Mycophenolate  mofetil  is  the  2-morpholinoethyl  ester  of  MPA.  MPA  is  a  potent  and  reversible 
inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their  proliferation  on  de  novo  synthesis  of  purines  whereas  other  cell  types  can  utilise  salvage 
pathways. For this reason, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells. 
Pharmacokinetics 
9/22 
EMEA 2008 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
complete  presystemic  metabolism  to  the  active  metabolite,  MPA  (mycophenolic  acid).  The 
immunosuppressant  activity  of  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  correlated  with  MPA  concentration.  The 
mean  bioavailability  of  oral  mycophenolate  mofetil  is  94%  relative  to  IV  mycophenolate  mofetil. 
Food  had  no  effect  on  the  extent  of  absorption  when  administered  at  doses  of  1.5  g  BID  to  renal 
transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40 % in the presence of food. 
MPA is 97 % bound to plasma albumin. 
As  a  result  of  enterohepatic  recirculation,  secondary  increases  in  plasma  MPA  concentration  are 
observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose.  
MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA 
(MPAG), which is not pharmacologically active. 
A negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (< 1 % of dose) in the urine. Most (about 87 %) of 
the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
GCP aspects 
The applicant has submitted a statement that all clinical bioequivalence studies were performed in 
compliance with GCP and ethical requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC, including the archiving of 
essential documents. 
Clinical studies 
To confirm that the applicant’s medicinal products are generic medicinal products of the innovator’s 
tablets  and  capsules,  five  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  conducted  to  support  this  application. 
Bioequivalence studies were performed for both strengths (250 mg and 500 mg) under fasting and fed 
conditions: 
For the 250 mg capsules: 
Study No 2006-1164 (fasting) 
Study No 2006-1266 (fed) 
For the 500 mg tablets: 
Study No 2006-1184 (fasting) 
Study No 2006-1267 (fed) 
Study No 2007-1335 (fed) 
As it has been established that taking mycophenolate mofetil with food reduces the Cmax whilst not 
affecting the extent of absorption the applicant has conducted the studies under fed as well as fasting 
condition.

Pharmacokinetics  
Study No 2006-1164 
A single dose comparative bioavailability study of two formulations of mycophenolate mofetil 250 
mg capsules under fasting conditions. 
•  Methods 
STUDY DESIGN  
This was an open label, single dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two treatment, crossover 
study to evaluate the bioavailability of two formulations of mycophenolate mofetil administered orally 
to healthy subjects under fasting conditions.  
Subjects  were  divided  in  two  groups.  In  each  group,  subjects  were  randomly  assigned to one of the 
two dosing sequences (AB or BA). The randomization scheme was generated by a computer program 
(SAS®).  The  study  took  place  in  two  phases  with  about  40  subjects  in  each  phase.  The  decision  to 
continue the second phase was based on the results of the first phase.  
Study drugs (one 250 mg capsule) were given after an overnight fast of minimum 10 hours with 240 
ml of water followed by at least 4 hours fasting. They were confined to the clinical facility until 36 
hours post-dose. Washout period between drug administrations was at least 7 days. 
The entire study was conducted according to the protocol except that instead of 40 subjects dosing per 
group it was 37 in Group I and 43 in Group II.

ANALYTICAL METHODS   
Concentrations of mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were measured 
from plasma samples collected over a 48 hour post dose interval in each period  
Plasma samples were assayed for mycophenolic acid using a validated analytical method. The 
analytical personnel were blinded from the treatment sequence. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES 
AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel, Thalf of mycophenolic acid were estimated. 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
Descriptive statistics were calculated by treatments for the PK variables. ANOVA was carried out on 
log-transformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax and on untransformed Tmax, Kel and Thalf. Tmax was 
analysed by non-parametric approach.  
The bioequivalence criteria consisted of 90% CI of the relative mean AUC and Cmax of the test to the 
reference should be 80-125%, in line with current EMEA guidelines (CHMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).

Study No 2006-1266 
A single dose comparative bioavailability study of two formulations of mycophenolate mofetil 250 
mg capsules under fed conditions. 
•  Methods 
STUDY DESIGN  
This was an open label, single dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two treatment, crossover 
study to evaluate the bioavailability of two formulations of mycophenolate mofetil administered orally 
to healthy subjects under fed conditions.  
Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  two  dosing  sequences  (AB  or  BA)  under  fed 
conditions. The randomization scheme was generated by a computer program (SAS®).  
Study drugs (one 250 mg capsule) were given after an overnight fast of minimum 10 hour with 240 ml 
of  water  and  after  a  high  calorie  fat  breakfast.  They  were  confined  to  the  clinical  facility  for  a 
minimum of 10.5 hours pre-dosing until the 24 hour post-dose blood sample. Washout period between 
drug administration was 7 days. 
The entire study was conducted according to the protocol.

POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
Healthy  non-smoking  male  subjects  (18-55  years)  and  post-menopausal  or  surgically  sterile  female 
subjects were included in the study. All subjects met the inclusion criteria. 
40 subjects were dosed in period I and 38 completed the study 
One  subject  withdrew  from  the  study  for  personal  reasons  prior  to  period  2  and  another  subject 
withdrew  prior to period 2 due to AE. 
A total of 38 subjects completed the study and were included in the PK analysis.  
Safety  analysis  consisting  of  monitoring  AE,  vital  signs  and  laboratory  (haematology,  chemistry, 
urine) analysis was also conducted. 
ANALYTICAL METHODS   
Concentrations of mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were measured 
from plasma samples collected over a 72 hour post dose interval in each period Plasma samples were 
assayed  for  mycophenolic  acid  using  a  validated  analytical  method.  The  analytical  personnel  were 
blinded from the treatment sequence. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES 
AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel, Thalf were estimated on mycophenolic acid.

Descriptive statistics were calculated by treatments for the PK variables. ANOVA was carried out on 
log-transformed  AUCt,  AUCinf  and  Cmax  and  on  untransformed  Tmax,  Kel  and  Thalf.  Tmax  was 
analysed by non-parametric approach.  
The bioequivalence criteria consisted of 90% CI of the relative mean AUC and Cmax of the test to the 
reference should be 80-125%, in line with current EMEA guidelines (CHMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). 
•  Results 
The results of the analysis of mycophenolic acid in 38 subjects is shown below: 
No relevant or serious AE were reported in the study. The 90% CI of the relative mean for AUC and 
Cmax lie between the accepted range of 80-125%. 
There were no subjects for whom the percentage of AUC0-∞ which was extrapolated was greater than 
20%. There was 1 subject for whom AUC0-∞ could not be calculated on the reference product and so 
did not contribute to the analysis of AUC0-∞.  
Plasma levels were below the limit of quantification at the start of period 2 for all subjects, indicating 
that the washout period was of an adequate duration.

STUDY DESIGN  
This was an open label, single dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two treatment, crossover 
study to evaluate the bioavailability of two formulations of mycophenolate mofetil administered orally 
to healthy subjects under fasting conditions.  
Subjects  were  divided  in  two  groups.  In  each  group,  subjects  were  randomly  assigned to one of the 
two dosing sequences (AB or BA). The randomization scheme was generated by a computer program 
(SAS®).  The  study  took  place  in  two  phases  with  about  40  subjects  in  each  phase.  The  decision  to 
continue the second phase was based on the results of the first phase.  
Study drugs (one 500 mg tablet) were given after an overnight fast of minimum 10 hours with 240 ml 
of water followed by at least 4 hours fasting. They were confined to the clinical facility until 36 hours 
post-dose. Washout period between drug administration was at least 7 days. 
The entire study was conducted according to the protocol except that instead of 40 subjects dosing per 
group it was 34 in Group I and 46 in Group II.

Conclusion on studies 2006-1184, 1267 & 2007-1335 
The applicant has investigated the relative bioavailability of the test and reference products in both the 
fed and fasted states. 
In the fasted state the single study demonstrated bioequivalence using the conventional criteria. 
In the fed state the initial study failed to demonstrate bioequivalence. This prompted the applicant to 
repeat the study using a larger sample size. The second study produced confidence intervals that were 
contained within the standard 0.80-1.25 limits.  
(cid:131)  Overall Conclusions on Bioequivalence studies 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) Mycophenolate mofetil Teva is considered 
bioequivalent with CellCept® Roche

Pharmacodynamics 
No new data have been submitted and none are required for this application. 
Additional data 
Not applicable. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. These generic medicinal products have not been marketed in 
any country. 
2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
(cid:131)  PSUR 
According  to  Volume  9-Pharmacovigilance  1.4.2.5.2,  less  frequent  PSURs  than  customary  for  new 
medicinal products are appropriate. The PSUR submission schedule for both strengths should follow 
the PSUR schedule for the reference products. The schedule should be specified before the end of the 
procedure. 
(cid:131)  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The applicant has submitted a detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system in place including 
the  responsible  person  for  pharmacovigilance  in  accordance  with  “The  guideline  on  monitoring  of 
compliance with Pharmacovigilance regulatory obligations and Pharmacovigilance inspections”. 
(cid:131)  Risk Management Plan 
No  description  of  Risk  Management  Plan  has  been  provided  by  the  applicant.  Since  the  application 
concerns  a  generic  with  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concern  requiring 
additional risk minimisation activities has been identified this approach is considered acceptable. 
Discussion on Clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted clinical bioequivalence studies for both strengths, 250 mg capsules and 
500  mg  tablets,  comparing  them  with  the  reference  product  under  fasting  and  fed  conditions.  The 
choice of a single dose study is justified as it is the most sensitive way to compare the bioequivalence 
of  two  formulations.  The  cross-over  design  minimises  variables  other  than  formulation  as  much  as 
possible. 
All studies demonstrated bioequivalence using the conventional criteria, except the initial study for the 
tablets  in  the  fed  state.  This  prompted  the  applicant  to  appropriately  repeat  the  study  using  a  larger 
sample size. The second study produced confidence intervals that were within the standard 80-125% 
limits.  
Overall, the benefit:risk ratio is favourable. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  the  bioequivalence  has  been  shown.  A 
benefit/Risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by concensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio  of  Mycophenolate  mofetil  Teva  in  the  prophylaxis  of  acute  transplant  rejection  in  patients 
receiving  allogeneic  renal,  cardiac  or  hepatic  transplants,  in  combination  with  ciclosporin  and 
corticosteroids  was  favourable  and 
the  marketing 
authorisation.  
therefore  recommended

Summary of risk management plan for  Teriflunomide Accord 
14 mg film-coated tablets (Teriflunomide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated 
tablets. The RMP details important risks of Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated tablets, how these 
risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg 
film-coated tablets risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Teriflunomide  Accord  14  mg  film-coated  tablets  prescribing  information  (SmPC/  PIL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated 
tablets should be used. 
Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated tablets should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of Teriflunomide 
Accord 14 mg film-coated tablets RMP.

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated tablets, together with measures to minimise 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated 
tablets risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including PSUR assessment and signal management activity, so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-coated tablets 
is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Teriflunomide  Accord  14  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Teriflunomide Accord 14 mg film-
coated  tablets.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is 
possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further 
evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine); 
Important identified risks 
•  Hepatic effects 
•  Hypertension 
•  Hematologic effects 
• 
Infections 
•  Acute Pancreatitis 
Important potential risks 
•  Teratogenicity 
Missing Information 
•  Long term safety in pediatric patients 
•  Serious opportunistic infections, including PML

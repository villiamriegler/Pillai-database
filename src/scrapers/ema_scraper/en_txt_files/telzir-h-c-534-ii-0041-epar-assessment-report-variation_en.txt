I. 
RECOMMENDATION 
This type II variation relates to the following changes: Update of section 4.2 “Posology and Method of 
Administration”,  4.3  “Contraindications”,  4.4  “Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use”  and  5.2 
“Pharmacokinetic properties” of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and section 2 “Before 
you  take  Telzir”  and  section  3  “How  to  take  Telzir”  of  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  with  data  from 
clinical  study  APV10017  to  implement  dosing  recommendation  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment. 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, this type II variation application: 
  is  approvable.  Since  all  issues  have  been  resolved.  The  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the 
product information are acceptable.  
II.  ASSESSMENT 
II.1.  Introduction 
A  Marketing  Authorisation  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  on  12  July  2004  for  Telzir 
(fosamprenavir  –  FPV).  FPV  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV)    is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  Type  1  (HIV-1)  infected  adults,  adolescents  and 
children of 6 years and above in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products. For 
ARV naïve and experienced adult patients the recommended dose is 700 mg FPV twice daily with 100 
mg RTV twice daily, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. FPV is rapidly and 
almost  completely  hydrolysed  to  amprenavir  (APV)  and  inorganic  phosphate  prior  to  reaching  the 
systemic circulation. The conversion of FPV to APV appears to primarily occur in the gut epithelium.  
APV is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. RTV, also an HIV PI, 
is  a  CYP3A4  substrate  and  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4.  RTV  acts  as  a  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
enhancer, resulting in an increased plasma APV concentration by inhibiting APV metabolism. APV is 
also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and both APV and RTV may induce CYP3A4. Therefore medicinal products 
that  are inducers, inhibitors  or  substrates  of  CYP3A4  must  be  used  with  caution  when administered 
concurrently with FPV and RTV. 
As  no  specific  study  was  performed  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  with Telzir, the  MAH  was 
required  to  provide  adequate  data  to  support  the  use  of  Telzir  in  patients  with  various  degrees 
(including  severe)  of  hepatic  impairment  as  a  follow-up  measure  (FUM  014)  to  be  fulfilled  post-
authorisation. 
Part of this FUM was submitted in December 2006 in the format of a type II variation (II/20 approved 
on 2 July 2007) in order to update the SPC, subsequent to a phase I, parallel, open-label, two week, 
repeat-dose study (APV 10017) designed to evaluate the plasma APV and RTV pharmacokinetics in 
HIV-1  infected  adult  patients  with  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  to 
matched  control  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function.  At  this  time,  results  were  only  provided  for 
patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  but  were  not  available  for  patients  with  severe 
hepatic impairment, as the recruitment was still ongoing for this group. 
As a result of this type II variation, the following dosing recommendations were adopted for patients 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment:  
“For adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) the recommended dose is 700 mg 
fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. 
For  adults  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score:  7-9)  the  recommended  dose  is 
450 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily.” 
Since,  at  the  time,  no  data  were  available  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  FPV  in 
combination with RTV remained contra-indicated in these patients.

Noteworthy,  the  number  of  HIV  infected  patients  with  underlying  hepatic  impairment  receiving 
FPV/RTV, since the approval for use in mild/moderate hepatic impairment in the EU on 2 July 07, is 
unknown.  However,  ongoing  observational  cohorts  study  (WEUKSTV2430)  being  conducted  in  the 
EU will assess the post-marketing safety experience in this patient population, in line with a CHMP 
request. 
Within this current submission, the MAH provides the remaining results of the previously submitted 
study  APV  10017.  These  results  only  concern  the  population  of  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment with their matching control with normal hepatic function. 
II.2 
Clinical Aspects 
The design of study APV 10017 was previously assessed in the setting of the type II variation II/20 
approved in July 2007. 
Title 
Patients 
A  Phase  I,  Parallel,  Open-label,  Multicenter,  Two  Week,  Repeat-dose  Study 
Evaluating  Plasma  Amprenavir  Pharmacokinetics  in  HIV-1-infected  Adult  Patients 
with  Mild,  Moderate  or  Severe  Hepatic  Impairment  Receiving  Fosamprenavir  + 
Ritonavir  Compared  to  Matched  Control  Patients  with  Normal  Hepatic  Function: 
Analyses of Mild and Moderate Hepatic Impairment. 
Adult male and female HIV-1 infected patients from the US and EU, 18 to 65 years of 
age, with a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 19-35 kg/m2 
Patients were either hepatically impaired or had normal hepatic function. 
The patients classified as hepatically impaired had liver fibrosis with known medical 
history  of  alcohol  abuse.  The  degree  of  impairment  was  defined  with  Child-Pugh 
scores.  Hepatically  impaired  patients  could  not  have  signs  of  hepatic  function 
deterioration. 
Patients  must  have  had  clinically  stable  HIV-1  disease  for  3  months  prior  to  study 
entry on current antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Concurrent  ART  consisting  of  NRTIs  or  N(t)RTIs  was  allowed  during  the  study; 
concurrent use of NNRTIs and protease inhibitors (PIs) was not allowed.

Criteria for 
evaluation 
Primary 
•  To  compare  plasma  APV  PK  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment  (as  defined  by  Child-Pugh  score  of  10-15)  receiving  FPV  300mg  BID 
with  a  reduced  dosing  frequency  of  RTV  100mg  once  daily  to  patients  with  normal 
hepatic function receiving FPV 700mg BID + RTV 100mg BID. 
Secondary 
•  To  compare  plasma  RTV  PK  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment (as defined by Child-Pugh score of 10-15) receiving FPV 300mg BID + 
RTV 100mg once daily to patients with normal hepatic function receiving FPV 700mg 
BID + RTV 100mg BID. 
•  To  describe  plasma  FPV  concentrations  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  normal 
hepatic function and in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment 
following repeat doses of FPV + RTV. 
• To describe the percent APV protein binding in HIV-1 infected patients with normal 
hepatic function and in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment 
following repeat doses of FPV + RTV. 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of FPV + RTV in HIV-1 infected 
patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment. 
Primary 
Plasma APV Cmax, AUC(0-τ), and Cτ in HIV-1 infected patients with normal hepatic 
function or mild, moderate, severe hepatic impairment following repeat doses of FPV 
+ RTV. 
Secondary 
•  Albumin,  bilirubin,  ALT,  AST,  CHE  (cholinesterase),  ammonia,  and  PT 
(prothrombin time). 
•  Plasma  RTV  Cmax,  AUC(0-24),  and  Cτ,  plasma  FPV  concentrations  and  plasma 
unbound APV concentrations (2 and 12-hour samples) in HIV-1 infected patients with 
normal or impaired hepatic function following repeat doses of FPV + RTV. 
•  Plasma  unbound  APV  concentrations  (2  and  12-hour  samples)  in  HIV-1  infected 
patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild, moderate, and severe 
hepatic impairment following repeat doses of FPV + RTV. 
• Adverse event (AE), concurrent medication/blood products, clinical laboratory, and 
vital signs assessments. 
- Single pre-dose blood samplings were collected on the mornings of Days 3, 7, 10, 13 
and 14. 
- Serial blood sampling were collected post-dose on Day 14 over 24 hours at 0.25, 0.5, 
0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours. (24 hour sampling time for groups 
A, B and C) 
-  Plasma  total  APV,  FPV  and  RTV  concentrations  were  assayed  using  validated 
LC/MS/MS  method.  The  lower  limit  of  quantification  was  10  ng/ml  for  APV  and 
RTV and 5 ng/ml for FPV. 
-  Plasma  unbound  APV  concentrations  were  measured  at  2  hours  (all  patients),  12 
hours (groups A, B, D) and 24 hours (group D) after dosing on Day 14. APV unbound 
concentration  were  measured  in  plasma  ultrafiltrate  with  a  validated  LC/MS/MS 
method. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. 
-  Safety  was  assessed  by  adverse  events  (AEs),  physical  examination,  clinical 
laboratory evaluations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and vital signs. 
-  In  addition,  Child-Pugh  scores,  plasma  HIV-1  ribonucleic  acid  (RNA),  CD4+  cell 
counts,  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  classification,  and  HIV-
associated conditions were collected during the study. 
Statistical 
methods 
- The following plasma APV and RTV parameters were reported: AUCo-τ (over the 
dosing  interval),  Cavg  the  average  plasma  concentration  over  the  dosing  interval  at 
steady-state  (calculated  as  AUCo-τ/τ),  CL/F  the  apparent  oral  clearance,  the    Cτ 
(average  pre-dose  concentrations  collected  at  steady  state),  C2h  unbound  and  Cτ 
Page 4  
 
unbound (plasma unbound APV concentration at 2 hours post-dosing and at the end of 
the dosing interval at steady-state), the percent unbound APV at 2 hours after dosing 
and  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  interval, T1/2  the  apparent terminal  phase  plasma  half-
life. 
-  Descriptive  statistics  of  plasma  APV  and  RTV  pharmacokinetic  parameters 
(geometric  means  with  95%  confidence  intervals  and  coefficients  of  variation)  were 
presented  for  each  group.  In  addition  the  geometric  least  square  (GLS)  mean  ratios 
and associated 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) were also presented. 
Discussion on the Study design  
In the previous assessment regarding study APV 10017 (Telzir II/20), the CHMP made the following 
comments: 
This study is so far the unique study in hepatic impairment performed in the target population of HIV 
infected patients. This is one particular interest of this study to be underlined, even if it has implied to 
switch virologically stable patients to FPV/RTV at various tested adjusted doses that could have been 
suboptimal for these patients.  
In addition,  
-

this study has enrolled patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment including the difficult-
to-treat population of patients with severe hepatic impairment;  
this study was a multiple dose study therefore expected to give more confidence in the results for 
a medicinal product to be used chronically;  
the number of patients enrolled per arm is satisfactory; 
strictly  in  line  with  the  European  guideline,  the  unbound  concentrations  of  medicinal  product 
were measured. This is of relevant importance since unbound concentrations is very likely to be 
modified  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  (as  a  result  of  hypoproteinemia)  for  such  a 
medicinal product highly protein bound;  
several dose adjustments were tested including two in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
In this field, it has to be underlined that a mix with fosamprenavir BID and ritonavir QD is not 
optimal  since  it  might  induce  some  confusion  for  patients.  In  addition  the  resort  to  the  oral 
solution is also not optimal for patients Nevertheless it has to be admitted that given the unique 
700 mg dosage the MAH does not have much latitude to adjust the dose.  
Overall, this study initiated at the time the European guideline was released for consultation is strictly 
in line with the spirit of the guideline.  
The results of study APV 10017 relative to patients with severe hepatic impairment and their matching 
control with normal hepatic function are reported below.

Patients in the severe hepatic impairment had lower CD4+ cell counts and were more likely to be co-
infected with Hepatitis C when compared with patients having normal hepatic function. Risk factors 
also  differed  between  groups,  with  injectable  medicinal  product  use  being  the  most  common  risk 
factor  (7/10,  70%)  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  with  homosexual  contact 
being the most common risk factor (5/7, 71%) for patients with normal hepatic function. 
Child-Pugh scores 
At Pre-baseline (Day -4), patients in the severe hepatic impairment group had total Child-Pugh scores 
ranging from 10 to 13. Most hepatically impaired patients had Grade 1 encephalopathy (8/10, 80%). 
Most patients had mild (Grade 2; 4/10, 40%) or moderate (Grade 3, 5/10, 50%) ascites.

When plasma APV PK was normalised to a 700mg FPV dose, severe hepatic impairment significantly 
increased plasma total APV Dose Normalised (DN)-AUC(0-τ) by 80%, DN-Cmax by 88%, and DN-Cτ 
by  45%  following  administration  of  FPV/RTV.  The  dosage  regimen  tested  in  severe  hepatic 
impairment, FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily, delivered 23% lower plasma APV AUC(0-τ), 
19%  lower  Cmax,  and  38%  lower  Cτ  values  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function 
receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. Plasma Median tmax was delayed 1.5 hours in the severe hepatic 
impairment group and APV t1/2 values were similar between patients with severe hepatic impairment

Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  had  a  higher  %unbound  APV  12  hours  after  dosing  and 
similar  plasma  unbound  concentration  at  12  hours  after  dosing  (unbound  Cτ)  compared  to  patients 
with normal hepatic function. However, at the 2-hour time point, there was no clear difference in the 
%unbound  APV  between  the  groups,  and  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  receiving  FPV 
300mg  BID  +  RTV  100mg  once  daily  had  lower  plasma  unbound  APV  concentration  2  hours  after 
dosing (C2h) than patients with normal hepatic function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. 
On average, plasma unbound APV Cτ values (the parameter considered to be associated with virologic 
efficacy)  were  comparable  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  in  patients  with  normal 
hepatic function.

Plots for individual unbound APV PK parameters are reported below. 
Discussion on the PK results 
The APV PK parameters were lower (about -20 to -30%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
receiving  FPV  300  mg  BID  +  RTV  100  mg  QD  compared  to  patients  with normal  hepatic  function 
receiving FPV/RTV 700/100 mg BID. The PK variability was also increased in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Of importance, the mean Cτ concentration of unbound APV is similar in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment  compared  with  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function,  whereas  the  mean  C2h 
concentration  of  unbound  APV  is  decreased  by  more  than  20%  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function. 
For  both  parameters  it  should  be  noted  that  the  PK  variability  is  increased  in  patients  with  severe 
hepatic impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function and therefore the bounds for 
confidence interval are very large.

observed RTV exposures over the same interval of time. 
Despite  reducing  the  RTV  dose  to  100mg  once  daily,  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  had 
64% higher plasma RTV Cmax, 40% higher Cavg, and 38% higher Cτ values compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. 
The  variability  in  RTV  PK  parameters  was  increased  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment 
compared with patients with normal hepatic function. 
Discussion on the Ritonavir concentrations 
The exposure of RTV is highly increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (AUC multiplied 
by almost a 3 fold factor) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. This increase in RTV 
exposure could lead to a deterioration of its safety profile. 
Page 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Safety results 
A  total  of  9  of  17  patients  (53%)  experienced  one  or  more  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (AE) 
irrespective of cause during the study.  Gastrointestinal disorders was the system organ class with the 
most AEs reported (Group E: 4/10 (40%); Group F: 0). 
A total of 3 of 17 patients (18%) reported one or more treatment-emergent drug-related AE during the 
study.  All  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  by  patients  in  the  severe  hepatic  impairment  group. 
Dyspepsia was the only drug-related AE reported by more than one subject. 
Two  patients,  both  in  the  severe  hepatic  impairment  group  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  and 
discontinued  from  investigational  product  due  to  AEs.  Subject  53  (Group  E)  discontinued  from 
investigational product following the first day of dosing due to Grade 1 vomiting that the investigator 
considered to be related to study medicinal product. Subject 283 (Group E) was withdrawn from the 
study due to Grade 4, serious, hepatic encephalopathy that the investigator considered not to be related 
to study medications. 
There was no meaningful change in clinical laboratory evaluations. 
The MAH acknowledged that APV10017 was a short term PK study, and that the long-term safety of 
the combination in patients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown. MAH proposed to study the 
safety of FPV/RTV-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this population in the ongoing 
cohort  study  WEUKSTV2430,  an  observational  study  involving  EU  cohorts  (ICONA,  HEPAVIH, 
MASTER)  which  is  currently  assessing  the  long-term  safety  of  the  approved  FPV/RTV  dosing 
regimen  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic impairment.  The MAH  proposed to address  the 
safety of this regimen over the longer term in patients with severe hepatic impairment in its ongoing 
observational cohort Study WEUKSTV2430 (FUM 45 and FUM 45.1; letter of undertaking dated 30 
April 2007). 
Discussion on the safety results 
No  safety  concern  emerged  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  in  this  study.  However,  as 
underlined  by  the  MAH,  the  number  of  patients  is  very  limited.  Therefore,  the  MAH’s  proposal  to 
investigate the safety of FPV/RTV treatment regimen in patients with severe hepatic impairment in the 
ongoing cohort study is fully endorsed. 
4. Pharmacodynamic results 
All of the patients who entered the study with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml remained suppressed 
through  Day  14.  Additionally,  all  of  the  patients  entering  the  study  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  >50 
copies/ml had a decrease in their plasma HIV-1 RNA levels between Baseline and Day 14, with one 
subject  in  each  treatment  group  achieving  undetectable  (<50  copies/mL)  levels  on  Day  14.  No 
substantial changes in CD4+ cell counts occurred in either treatment group from Baseline to Day 14.

III.  CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION 
Of  note,  the  same  changes  are  proposed  for  Telzir  film-coated  tablets  and  for  Telzir  50  mg/ml  oral 
solution. They are reported below. 
CHMP’s comments and proposed changes (addition, deletion) are reported below.

... 
Hepatic impairment 
For  adults  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score:  5-6)  the  recommended  dose  is  700 mg 
fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. 
For  adults  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score:  7-9)  the  recommended  dose  is 
450 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. As it is not possible to achieve 
this  fosamprenavir  dose  using  the  tablet  formulation,  these  patients  should  be  treated  with 
fosamprenavir oral suspension. 
For adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 10-15): fosamprenavir should be used 
with caution and at a reduced dose of 300 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once 
daily.  As  it  is  not  possible  to  achieve  this  fosamprenavir  dose  using  the  tablet  formulation,  these 
patients should be treated with fosamprenavir oral suspension. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The MAH’s proposal to specify that Telzir should be used with caution in adults with severe hepatic 
impairment is supported, given the characteristics of this difficult-to-treat population more at risk of 
adverse events and in view of the PK results (high inter-variability, increase in RTV exposure). 
To avoid administration error of ritonavir, it is worth emphasising on the once daily regimen as in the 
package  leaflet:”  only”  once  daily  for  all  the  wording  of  the  recommendation  in  case  of  hepatic 
impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe) 
Even  with  these  dose  adjustments  for  adults  with  mild  or,    moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment, 
some patients may have higher than anticipated amprenavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations due to 
inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore safety monitoring is warranted. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Due to the high variability lower or higher exposure can be observed therefore the recommendation 
should be completed as follows: 
“Even with these dose adjustments for adults with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, some 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment  may  have  higher  or  lower  than  anticipated  amprenavir  and/or 
ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function due to increased 
inter-patient  variability  (see  section  5.2),  therefore  safety  a  close  monitoring  of  safety  and  virologic 
response is warranted. 
Telzir in combination with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
CHMP’s comment: 
For  completeness,  the  MAH  should  propose  a  statement  about  the  lack  of  data  for  children  with 
hepatic impairment, along with a recommendation for the prescriber.

Telzir  with  ritonavir  should  be  used  with  caution  and  at  reduced  doses  in  adults  with  mild  or,  
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) and is contraindicated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). . 
Patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  or  C  and  treated  with  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  are  at  an 
increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral 
therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for 
these medicinal products. 
Patients  with  pre-existing  liver  dysfunction,  including  chronic  active  hepatitis,  have  an  increased 
frequency  of  liver  function  abnormalities  during  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  and  should  be 
monitored  according  to  standard  practice.  If  there  is  evidence  of  worsening  liver  disease  in  such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Hepatic impairment 
… 
The  plasma  amprenavir  pharmacokinetics  were  evaluated  in  a  14  day  repeat-dose  study  in  HIV-1 
infected adult subjects with mild or,  moderate or severe hepatic impairment receiving fosamprenavir 
with ritonavir compared to matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. 
… 
In  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  7-9),  a  reduced  dose  of 
fosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is 
predicted to  deliver similar  plasma  amprenavir  Cmax  and  AUC(0-12),  but  approximately  35 % lower 
plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88 % higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 
values  than  achieved  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  receiving  the  standard  fosamprenavir 
with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. 
In  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of 
fosamprenavir  300  mg  twice  daily  with  a  reduced  dosing  frequency  of  ritonavir  100  mg  once  daily 
delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, 
but  similar  unbound  plasma  amprenavir  C12  values  than  achieved  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function receiving  the standard fosamprenavir  with  ritonavir  700  mg  /  100  mg  twice  daily  regimen. 
Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% 
higher  ritonavir  Cmax,  40%  higher  ritonavir  Cavg,  and  38%  higher  ritonavir  C12  than  achieved  in 
subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  receiving  the  standard  fosamprenavir  with  ritonavir  700  mg  / 
100 mg twice daily regimen.   
CHMP’s comment: 
It  is  considered  more  appropriate  to  mention  in  the  SPC  the  value  of  AUC  instead  of  Cavg  for 
ritonavir. Since AUC was increased by about 3 fold, it is worth giving this information to prescribers. 
Therefore, the following modification is proposed: 
“In  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of 
fosamprenavir  300  mg  twice  daily  with  a  reduced  dosing  frequency  of  ritonavir  100  mg  once  daily 
Page 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but 
similar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in patients with normal hepatic function 
receiving  the  standard  fosamprenavir  with  ritonavir  700  mg  /  100  mg  twice  daily  regimen.  Despite 
reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, patients with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher 
ritonavir  Cmax,  40%  higher  ritonavir  Cavg  2.8  fold  higher  AUC,  and  38% higher  ritonavir  C12 than 
achieved in patients with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 
700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.” 
Fosamprenavir with ritonavir was generally well-tolerated in subjects with mild to, moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment, and these regimens had similar adverse event and clinical laboratory profiles as 
previous studies of HIV-1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Fosamprenavir with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 
4.3).

IV.  REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
Page 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the review of the data on clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety within this procedure, 
this type II variation could be approvable provided that the CHMP’s proposed changes for the SPC 
are taken into account. 
Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  should  submit  a  revised  Product  Information  considering  the  above  comments  and  the 
changes requested in the SPC as detailed in part III of this Assessment Report. 
The CHMP proposed to extend the timetable as follows: 
 30 days (including 15 days for Rapporteur assessment) 
V.  ASSESSMENT  OF  THE  RESPONSES  TO  THE  REQUEST  FOR  SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION 
Overall  the  MAH  agreed  on  all  the  changes  to  the  SPC  and  PL  requested  by  CHMP  or  provided 
alternative  wording  with  supporting  rational  that  was  considered  satisfactory.  Wording  details  are 
given below. No further changes are deemed necessary in the framework of this procedure. 
Question 1: 
SPC – Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration 
-  The  MAH’s  proposal  to  specify  that  Telzir  should  be  used  with  caution  in  adults  with  severe 
hepatic impairment is supported, given the characteristics of this difficult-to treat population more 
at  risk  of  adverse  events  and  in  view  of  the  PK  results  (high  inter-variability,  increase  in  RTV 
exposure). 
To avoid administration error of ritonavir, it is worth emphasizing on the once daily regimen as 
in the package  leaflet: “only”  once  daily  for  all  the wording  of  the recommendation in case  of 
hepatic impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe). 
The  MAH  considered  that  the  wording  “only  once  daily”  is  appropriate  for  the  package  leaflet,  but 
that the SPC already clearly informs the prescribers that the dosage regimen for ritonavir is once daily. 
However, to provide further emphasis, the MAH proposed that the word “once” should be changed to 
bold type in the SPC. This proposal is endorsed by the CHMP. 
-  Due  to  the  high  variability  lower  or  higher  exposure  can  be  observed  therefore  the 
recommendation should be completed as follows: 
“Even with these dose adjustments for adults with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, 
some  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  may  have  higher  or  lower  than  anticipated  amprenavir 
and/or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function due 
to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore safety a close monitoring of safety 
and virologic response is warranted.” 
The  MAH  agreed  with this  proposed  wording  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC. The  CHMP  has  no further 
comment. 
-  For completeness, the MAH should propose a statement about the lack of data for children with 
hepatic impairment, along with a recommendation for the prescribers. 
The following wording proposed by the MAH is endorsed by the CHMP: “No dose recommendation 
can be made for children and adolescents with hepatic impairment as no studies have been conducted 
in these age groups”. 
Question 2: 
Page 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SPC – Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
… 
Hepatic impairment 
It is considered more appropriate to mention in the SPC the value of AUC instead of this of Cavg for 
ritonavir.  Indeed,  since  AUC  was  increased  by  about  3  fold,  it  is  worth  giving  this  information  to 
prescribers. 
Expression of RTV exposure in section 5.2 
RTV was administered BID to patients with normal hepatic function and QD to patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. The 2.8-fold increase in plasma RTV AUC(0-τ), therefore, reflects exposures over 
different time intervals, specifically AUC(0-12) for the BID regimen and AUC(0-24) for the QD regimen. 
To represent exposure over the same interval of time either Cavg (calculated as AUC(0-τ)/τ for both the 
BID  and  QD  regimens) or  AUC(0-24)  (where  AUC(0-τ)  for  the  BID  regimen  (τ=12) is  multiplied  by  2 
and the AUC(0-τ) for the QD regimen (τ=24) is unchanged) can be used. In Section 5.2 of the SPC, the 
MAH emphasised the comparison of the observed plasma RTV AUC adjusted for the dosing interval 
difference because this is representative of the exposure that patients will have to RTV over a given 
period of time. This was the basis for the original proposal to include the comparison of RTV Cavg 
within Section 5.2 of the SPC.  
The  MAH  accepted,  however,  to  present  AUC  values  in  the  SPC  but  proposed  to  represent  RTV 
exposure as AUC(0-24) rather than AUC(0-τ) for both regimens. In essence, patients with severe hepatic 
impairment receiving FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg QD will have 40% higher AUC’s over a 24-
hour period of time (AUC(0-24)) than will patients with normal hepatic impairment receiving FPV/RTV 
700/100mg BID. 
This  approach  together  with  the  following  wording  proposed  by  the  MAH  was  endorsed  by  the 
CHMP: 
“In  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of 
fosamprenavir  300  mg  twice  daily  with  a  reduced  dosing  frequency  of  ritonavir  100  mg  once  daily 
delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but 
similar  unbound  plasma  amprenavir  C12  values  than  achieved  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function receiving  the standard fosamprenavir  with  ritonavir  700  mg  /  100  mg  twice  daily  regimen. 
Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% 
higher  ritonavir  Cmax,  40%  higher  ritonavir  Cavg  AUC(0-24),  and  38%  higher  ritonavir  C12  than 
achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 
700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen”. 
Question 3: 
PL - Section 3 How to take Telzir 
The  CHMP  proposed  to  adopt  different  statements  for  the  Telzir  tablet  PL  and  for  the  Telzir  oral 
solution PL as follows.  
Tablet 
Adults with liver disease 
If  you  have  mild  liver  disease,  the  dose  is  one  Telzir  tablet  (700  mg)  twice  daily  with  100  mg 
ritonavir  only  once  daily.  If  you  have  moderate  or  severe  liver  disease  the  recommended  dose  of 
Telzir  has  to  be  lowered  (use  Telzir  oral  suspension).  is  450  mg  twice  daily  (use  Telzir  oral 
suspension) with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily. 
Oral suspension 
Adults with liver disease 
If you have mild liver disease, the dose is 14 ml Telzir oral suspension (700 mg fosamprenavir) 
twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily.

If you have moderate liver disease the dose is 9 ml Telzir oral suspension (450 mg fosamprenavir) 
twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily. 
If  you  have  severe  liver  disease  the  dose  is  6  ml  Telzir  oral  suspension  (300  mg  fosamprenavir) 
twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily. 
The MAH accepted that the wording should be modified, but proposed for the tablets a more patient-
friendly alternative wording, as follows, that is endorsed by the CHMP. 
“If  you  have  moderate  or  severe  liver  disease,  the  dose  of  Telzir  has  to  be  lowered.  This  dose 
adjustment can not be made with Telzir tablets. You must take Telzir oral suspension.” 
With  regards  to  the  proposal  to  amend  the  oral  suspension  PL,  the  MAH  accepted  the  wording 
proposed by the CHMP. The CHMP has no further comment. 
VI.  OVERALL DISCUSSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
In  the  context  of  a  public  health  need  for  ARV  products  to  treat  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment, the CHMP would like to emphasise the importance of study APV10017, especially that 
this study was well designed, in line with the European guideline. 
Based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  results  obtained  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  it  is 
acceptable  to  recommend  the  dose  studied  in  APV10017  for  these  patients  i.e.  FPV  300  mg  twice 
daily with RTV 100 mg once daily. 
At  last,  it  is  appreciated  that  the  MAH  proposes  to  study  the  safety  of  FPV/RTV  in  patients  with 
severe  hepatic  impairment  in  the  ongoing  cohort  study  which  is  currently  assessing  the  long-term 
safety  of  the  approved  FPV/RTV  dosing  regimen  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic 
impairment. 
The MAH’s initial proposed change to the product information was appropriate. Indeed, the need for a 
close  monitoring  of  patients,  linked  to  the  high  inter-patient  variability,  was  clearly  mentioned. 
However the CHMP requested additional changes to the SPC and PL in order to further simplify the 
product information and to further clarify the recommendations to the treating physicians. The MAH 
addressed  satisfactorily  all  requests  made  by  the  CHMP  and  provided  the  corresponding  updated 
product information. 
VII.  EPAR CHANGES 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope: 
Update  of  section  4.2  “Posology  and  Method  of  Administration”,  4.3  “Contraindications”,  4.4 
“Special warnings and precautions for use” and 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” of the Summary of 
Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  and  section  2  “Before  you  take  Telzir”  and  section  3  “How  to  take 
Telzir”  of  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  with  data  from  clinical  study  APV10017  to  implement  dosing 
recommendation in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Scientific discussion: 
Please  note  that  this  assessment  report  will  be  published  after deletion  of  commercially  confidential 
information.

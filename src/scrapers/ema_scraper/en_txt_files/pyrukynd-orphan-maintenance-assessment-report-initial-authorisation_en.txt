2. Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor Agios Netherlands B.V. submitted on 27 November 2019 an application for designation as 
an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
MITAPIVAT SULFATE for treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing mitapivat sulfate was 
considered justified based on clinical data in patients showing improvement in haemoglobin levels 
and reduction in markers of haemolysis; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to symptoms of chronic haemolytic 
anaemia and sequelae of periodic red blood cell transfusions, comprising fatigue, shortness of 
breath, splenomegaly, cholecystolithiasis, heart failure, as well as compromised immune function 
and thromboembolic complications after splenectomy. The condition is also life-threatening due to 
aggravation of haemolytic anaemia during pregnancy and aplastic crisis during viral infections, as 
well as hydrops fetalis and perinatal death; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European 
Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing mitapivat sulfate as an orphan medicinal product for 
the orphan condition: treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency”. 
3. Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made

Condition 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is a type of hereditary haemolytic anaemia caused by a 
deficiency in pyruvate kinase, which leads to destruction of red blood cells (RBCs). It has been 
estimated that there are about 371 PKLR gene variants associated with the disease. 
In normal cells, pyruvate kinase enzymatically catalyses the metabolic conversion of 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into pyruvate and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) as the final step in glycolysis, creating 50% of the RBC ATP (Grace et al, 2015). 
ATP is the main source of energy of the RBC. Pyruvate kinase deficiency leads to insufficient ATP 
production, resulting in RBC haemolysis due to an impaired ability to maintain cellular membrane 
homeostasis (van Wijk and van Solinge, 2005). Pyruvate kinase deficiency has been reported to be 
associated with reduced RBC survival (Aizawa et al, 2003). 
For some patients with PK deficiency, the disease manifests itself at birth, and the diagnosis is early. 
But for many patients, diagnosis may take months or even years, or they remain non-diagnosed. The 
diagnosis of PK deficiency is multifactorial, based on the exclusion of the most common causes of 
haemolytic anaemias, and upon the demonstration of decreased enzyme activity and/or the 
identification of causative mutations in the PKLR gene.  
The condition has been previously accepted by the COMP and is appropriate for an orphan designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Pyrukynd is indicated for the treatment of pyruvate kinase 
deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult patients (see section 4.4)” falls within the scope of the designated 
orphan condition “treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency”. 
The objective of section 4.4 of the SmPC (Summary of medicinal Product Characteristics) is to provide 
information on “Special warnings and precautions for use” to healthcare professionals. The cross 
reference to section 4.4 pertains to the evidence on the use of this medicinal product in patients who 
were homozygous for the R479H mutation or who had 2 non-missense mutations (without the 
presence of another missense mutation) in the PKLR gene. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR for detailed information. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening.   
At the time of this review Pyruvate kinase deficiency is presented to the COMP to remain chronically 
debilitating and life-threatening disease. However, clinical manifestations are heterogeneous, and 
severity varies considerably depending on the genotype of the condition. Infections and pregnancy, 
and other cause of oxidative stress could trigger haemolysis. Common symptoms include fatigue, 
shortness of breath, tachycardia, jaundice, and bone changes associated with extramedullary 
erythropoiesis (Grace, Bianchi, et al, 2018; Grace, Cohen, et al, 2018). Patients with PK deficiency 
suffer from acute and long-term clinical complications associated with chronic nonspherocytic 
haemolytic anaemia and ineffective erythropoiesis (Grootendorst et al, 2021).  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000068458 
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 
Untreated PK deficiency is characterized by lifelong haemolytic anaemia and subsequent associated 
comorbidities, including iron overload, need for cholecystectomy, pulmonary hypertension, 
extramedullary haematopoiesis, liver cirrhosis, endocrinopathy, and bone fracture. 
Recent real-world evidence using US veterans health administration data suggests that patients with 
PK deficiency may have an increased risk for mortality compared with age-matched controls 
(Zagadailov et al, 2020). PK deficiency patients had a significantly higher risk of mortality, with a 
hazard ratio for mortality of 2.3 (2-sided P value: 0.0306). The study was limited in both the sample 
size and generalizability of patients.  
The COMP concluded that the condition remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to 
lifelong haemolytic anaemia and subsequent associated comorbidities leading to a reduction in life 
expectancy. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be 0.5 per 10,000. 
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 0.584 per 10,000. 
To update the prevalence calculation, the sponsor conducted a systematic literature review 
encompassing searches in Medline, Embase, PubMed, Ovid, a single conference year of the Deutsche 
Gesellschaft fur Hamatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, and other publicly available sources of 
information. The search yielded prevalence estimates for PK deficiency in the European Union (EU), 
Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and in populations with relevant European origin (e.g., Canada); 
however, the estimates provided by Carey, de Medicis, and Beutler are population-based, and thus 
were deemed to be more robust estimates by the sponsor (Table 1).

1. Population size was taken from Eurostat 2020 per the EU guideline on the format and content of orphan 
designations (ENTR/6283/00 Rev 5), including the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and 
Norway https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_pjan/default/table?lang=en  
2. Overall prevalence includes diagnosed and undiagnosed populations  
3. This study directly reported prevalence per one million, based on the lowest and highest prevalence of patients 
with PK deficiency in clinical follow-up, reported among 14 European countries and the United Kingdom. The highest 
prevalence was from Denmark; the country with the lowest prevalence was not reported. 
Taking into consideration that a significant number of patients with PK deficiency may remain 
undiagnosed (Secrest et al, 2020), the sponsor is proposing a total estimated prevalence of PK 
deficiency (diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) in the EU to be 26,479 patients (0.584 people per 
10,000) (Beutler and Gelbart, 2000). 
The COMP concluded that the previously accepted prevalence estimate of approximately 0.5 per 
10,000 persons in the EU is still valid.

Existing methods 
There is currently no authorised treatment in the EU for this indication.  
The current standard clinical care of patients with PK deficiency is mainly supportive and involves the 
treatment and management of symptoms and complications of PK deficiency (Table 3). This includes 
red blood cell transfusions, splenectomy, iron chelation, cholecystectomy and jaundice therapies. 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplant has been pursued in a small number of patients with mixed 
outcomes.  
Red blood cell transfusions are most often used to treat anaemia in infants and younger children with 
PK deficiency and are effective in stabilizing nadir Hb levels in the approximate range of 6 to 8 g/dL to 
ensure that a child grows and thrives. In general, the decision to regularly transfuse a patient with PK 
deficiency is multifactorial and is based on individual basis. With decreasing rates of viral 
infections/haemolytic triggers, the frequency of transfusions continues to fall through adolescence to 
adulthood, with 14% of subjects aged 12 to <18 years and 11% of adults with PK deficiency reported 
as receiving regular transfusions (≥6 transfusions over a 12-month period) (Grace and Barcellini, 
2020). Most adults with the disease have undergone splenectomy as children and require only sporadic 
or ad hoc transfusions, which are usually administered in the context of an acute haemolytic episode 
triggered by infection, trauma, pregnancy, or stress. While effective at stabilizing Hb levels, repeated 
transfusions, even in low numbers, can worsen iron overload, a serious complication requiring further 
intervention to remove excess iron. As a result of the risks associated with iron overload, monitoring 
for iron overload is essential and includes evaluation of liver iron concentration by MRI, a procedure 
requiring general anaesthesia in children.  
Splenectomy is recommended in guidelines for patients with PKD who receive regular transfusions or 
are severely anaemic, to reduce the need for transfusion and/or to increase Hb (Iolascon et al, 2017). 
This procedure is practised in approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency between the 
ages of 5 and 18 years (Grace and Barcellini, 2020). However, in almost all patients, haemolysis and 
indirect hyperbilirubinemia persist after splenectomy, and patients remain at risk for gallstones and 
jaundice (Grace et al, 2019), leading to a 50% likelihood of a cholecystectomy after splenectomy 
(Grace et al, 2018a).  In addition, splenectomy increases the risk of infection due to encapsulated 
organisms, requiring patients to undergo prolonged prophylactic antibiotic therapy and maintain strict 
vaccination compliance, and increases the risk of thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, and iron 
overload (Crary and Buchanan, 2009; Evans, 1985; Jones et al, 2016). Moreover, patients with the 
most severe haemolysis and anaemia, or with two non-missense PKLR mutations, are least likely to 
respond to splenectomy. Up to 10% of patients have no improvement in haemoglobin or haemolysis; 
typically, in patients with more severe haemolysis pre-splenectomy (Grace et al, 2019). 
Iron chelation is used to address the frequent iron overload in patients with PK deficiency and can 
occur even in patients who are not regularly transfused (van Beers et al, 2019; Porter et al, 2017). 
Compliance is often poor (as a result of tolerability issues), which limits its benefit. Chelating agents 
also have risks associated with their use (e.g., decreases in serum creatinine clearance and increases 
of transaminases), and the label contains warnings for hepatic toxicity including failure, and renal 
toxicity including failure, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Additionally, serious hypersensitivity 
reaction has also been reported (Exjade Summary of Product Characteristics, 2020). Paediatric growth 
retardation in younger children is a warning for desferroxamine (Desferrioxamine mesilate Summary of 
Product Characteristics, 2017). 
Jaundice therapies such as rifampicin may be prescribed to prevent and/or reduce the jaundice 
commonly associated with PK deficiency. In the PK Deficiency NHS and mitapivat clinical studies

(AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006 and AG348-C--007), reported jaundice therapies included ursodiol and 
phenobarbital. 
Hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation is rarely performed. Since, although potentially 
curative, the practice bears relatively high morbidity and mortality rate compared with supportive care 
(Grace and Barcellini, 2020; van Straaten et al, 2018). A worldwide review identified 16 PK deficiency 
patients in which the 2-year cumulative survival rate was 74% (van Straaten et al, 2018). The serious 
and often life-threatening complications associated with the procedure, particularly in very young 
children, make transplantation a difficult decision, and the benefit-risk determination is most often in 
favour of supportive care rather than transplant. 
The COMP concluded that there is no approved pharmacological treatment or method that qualifies as 
a satisfactory treatment.

5. COMP position adopted on 19 September 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.5 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due acute and long-term clinical 
complications associated with chronic haemolytic anaemia which could lead to fatigue, iron 
accumulation, jaundice and pruritis, gallstones, bone deformations due to extramedullary 
erythropoiesis and a reduction in life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of the condition that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Pyrukynd, mitapivat sulfate, for 
treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (EU/3/20/2270) is not removed from the Community Register 
of Orphan Medicinal Products.

DMF and MEF are esters of fumaric acid. DMF is pre-systemically hydrolysed by ubiquitous esterases to 
its major active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). 
Likewise, MEF is metabolised by esterases to FA.

authors claimed these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) and thus could be interpreted 
as  supporting  clinically  relevant  effects  of  MEF-Na.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  average 
psoriasis severity score, established as efficacy endpoint in the section of methods in the article, was 
not different between both groups. Subscores were not presented as endpoints in this study and there 
was no evidence of adjustment for multiplicity. Therefore, the claim on statistical significance on scaling 
and itching scores could not be agreed. The small sample size is an additional limitation of the study.  
No difference was seen between the 720 mg versus the 240 mg regimen with regard to the number of 
improved  patients.  The  average  final  scores  of  the  total  groups  and  the  extent  of  the  eruption,  the 
redness and the thickness were the same, but significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between 
the final scores of scaling and itching of both groups. 
Treatment  with  MEF-Na  at  the dose of  720mg  or  240  mg  daily  resulted in  comparable  considerable 
improvements  (>50%  n=3  in  both  groups).  Indeed,  the  same  number  of  patients  showed  an 
improvement > 50% of the global score in both groups.  
Therefore, no conclusions on MEF-Na efficacy in psoriasis can be made based on this study. Moreover, 
no direct comparison to DMF was performed in these studies. 
No difference between MEF-Na at the dose of 240 mg daily and placebo was observed in Study II.

compared using Fisher’s Exact test (FET) or a chi-squared. Additionally, ordered logistic regression was

While Nieboer 1989 used a global psoriasis score different than the one that is currently considered as 
a  standard  (PASI),  it  should  be  noted  that  in  both  cases  the  response  is  scored  as  a  percentage  of 
improvement with respect to the baseline value. In this regard, a 75% reduction in the PASI score with 
respect to baseline is the current standard of response assessment used for primary endpoints in most 
clinical  trials  of  psoriasis.  Lower  level  of  responses  (e.g.  50%  reduction)  have  also  been  used  as 
endpoints.  However,  responses  below  50%  are  not  considered  as  an  acceptable  demonstration  of 
treatment response. This is in line with the CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medical products 
indicated for the treatment of Psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).

The objective of the BRIDGE study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of DMF 
(LAS41008), compared with placebo and Fumaderm, in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. 
In  this  Phase  III,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  noninferiority  trial,  patients  were  randomised  to 
receive LAS41008, Fumaderm, or placebo (2:2:1) for 16 weeks, up titrating to a maximum daily DMF 
dose of 720 mg, depending upon individual response. 
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. 
Statistical analysis 
The sample-size calculations were based on PASI 75 response rates of 50% and 10% for LAS41008 and 
placebo, respectively, and ‘clear’/’almost clear’ PGA response rates of 40% for LAS41008 and 10% for 
placebo. For the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm® regarding PASI 75 at week 16, a 
zero difference was assumed and a noninferiority margin of 15% was set. An alpha level of 0.05 was 
defined and a dropout rate of 15% was factored into the calculations. A total of 690 patients (276 per 
active group and 138 in the placebo group) provided a power of > 99% for the two superiorities 
tests of LAS41008 vs. placebo, and 90% for the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm.

Evaluation comment 
Based on the above results, the Authors concluded that the study has demonstrated the efficacy and 
safety of LAS41008 (DMF) for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, showing it to be 
significantly superior to placebo and noninferior to the approved combination of FAEs (Fumaderm).

There was a small numerical difference in favor of Fumaderm in regard to the co-primary endpoints and 
most of the secondary endpoints. As stated in the EPAR “The effects in regard to the co-primary endpoints 
were numerically slightly lower in the Skilarence group compared to Fumaderm although this could be 
due to variability, a limited PD and the efficacy effect of MEFs in Fumaderm may also be contributing to 
an anti-psoriatic effect”. Therefore, these differences although suggesting an additional therapeutic effect 
of MEF in Fumaderm may also appear due to variability or a limited PD. More importantly, it should be 
noted that this study was aimed to demonstrate superiority of DMF versus placebo and non-inferiority 
versus DMF/MEF. Consequently, the design of this study does not allow to demonstrate superiority of 
DMF/MEF versus DMF.  
The  coprimary  endpoints  were  the  percentage  of  patients  achieving  ≥  75%  improvement  in  Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in

3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA

Results 
Treatment with the FAE mixture was switched to the DMF product without any interruption on the basis 
of the current DMF dose in the FAE mixture. Patients were then scheduled for the next regular check-up 
three months later. To assess psoriasis severity, the PASI index (psoriasis area and severity index) was 
used. When presenting for their first check-up after switching, patients were handed a questionnaire to 
investigate their views about tolerability and efficacy and to provide a global judgment of the switch. 
Figure 14: Number of patients related to the duration of continuous FAE therapy that they 
received before switching from the FAE mixture to the DMF product (n = 40) 
A total of 40 patients (24 male, 16 female) were prospectively and consecutively recruited to the study 
and underwent a check-up after switching treatments. The age of adult patients ranged from 18 to 74 
years with a mean age of 46 years. One patient was 13 years old and received treatment off-label.

In general, the patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive 
(18 positive, 18 neutral, 4 negative).  
Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 3/37 had a higher PASI 
severity  after  switching  (Figure  14).  A  PASI  estimate  was  not  available  at  one  of  the  visits  in  3/40 
patients.  
Most patients were treated with a daily DMF dose between 120 mg and 480 mg and had previously been 
treated with the FAE mixture for one to five years.

This prospective study was aimed to investigate the switch from the currently used DMF/MEF to DMF 
monotherapy. The study was not designed to evaluate the treatment difference between DMF/MEF and 
DMF in the treatment of psoriasis.  The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical course of PASI 
in patients after switching to the DMF product.  
The patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive (18 positive, 
18 neutral, 4 negative). Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 
3/37 had a higher PASI severity after switching.  
Treatment with the DMF/MEF was switched to the DMF product without any interruption. Patients clinical

and 80% in the DMF/MEF group. However, this complete case analysis may be biased. Except for the 
single patient for whom the tables were stolen, all other patients discontinued due to adverse events, an 
intercurrent event, likely informative that was completely disregarded by the investigators. Therefore, 
the comparison of 55% - 80% should not be considered a reliable estimate of the difference. Additionally, 
In Falkvoll et al. (2019) study, efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, 
while 3/37 had a higher PASI severity after switching from DMF/MEF combination to DMF. However, it 
was not stated clearly in how many patients PASI improved. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude on 
differences in efficacy between the two treatments.  
The most relevant study for this assessment appears to be study by Mrowietz et al. (2017), which was 
a  pivotal  study  for  the  Skilarence  MAA.  The  study  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  DMF  to

of the demonstration of non-inferiority to Fumaderm was found questionable. As it was discussed in the

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication reads as follows: Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for 
the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or 
heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1).  
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in an absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is 
an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and 
secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport results in the multisystem pathology associated 
with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF.  
F508del is the most common disease-causing mutation (84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% 
of the individuals in Europe).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and screening tools 
CF affects approximately a total of 31,000 individuals in the US and a total of 42.000 in the EU 
(excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)1,2. The incidence and prevalence of CF vary 
between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North America 
and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In Europe, the median age of all CF patients is 18.5 
years (with the youngest patient being diagnosed just after birth and the oldest patients being 88.4 
years of age). Despite advances in treatment, the current median age of death in a patient with CF 
was approximately 31 years in 2018, and the future predicted median age of survival is approximately 
47 years1,2. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified.  
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function.

• Class I mutations: Defective protein production  
• Class II mutations: Defective protein processing  
• Class III mutations: Defective regulation  
• Class IV mutations: Defective chloride conduction  
• Class V mutations: Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein (less transcription)  
Class I, II and III usually lead to a classic (severe) CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency.  
Class IV and V are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease. 
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR), which is considered a Class II 
mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no 
chloride transport. The decrease in the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in 
the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR 
protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the 
cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at 
the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease.  
More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Most of these mutations are not 
associated with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database (an online resource that 
provides clinical and nonclinical data about CF-associated CFTR mutations) contains information on 412 
of these identified mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 346 mutations as disease-causing.  
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. In general, a complete or near-complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is 
referred to as “minimal function” of CFTR (class I, II and III). A residual CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport is referred to as “residual function” of CFTR (class IV and V). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In Europe, the median age of all CF patients was 18.5 years (with the youngest patient being 
diagnosed just after birth and the oldest patients being 88.4 years of age) in 20172. Despite advances 
in treatment, the current median age of death in a patient with CF is approximately 31 years. In 2018, 
the median predicted survival age of those born in 2018 was 47.4 years (95% CI:: 44.2–50.3 years)1. 
Such a prediction assumes no further improvement in mortality rate and thus does not take into 
account the potential impact of CFTR modulators and other improvements in clinical care. 
CF is diagnosed when both of the following criteria are met:  
•  Clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system (CLASSIC), or positive 
newborn screening or genetic testing for siblings of patients with CF  
AND  
• 
Evidence of CFTR dysfunction (any of the following):  
o Elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L (CLASSIC)  
o Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, one from each parental allele  
o Abnormal nasal potential difference  
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 10/91 
 
 
 
 
Around 2 % of patients lack one or more of the “CLASSIC” features. They may have milder clinical 
symptoms and/or normal to intermediate sweat chloride results. These patients can still be diagnosed 
with CF if they meet genetic or functional criteria3. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Existing treatments for CF can be broadly classified into 2 groups: (1) therapies that manage the 
symptoms, complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy) and (2) CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) which target 
the underlying cause of the disease. Concomitant administrations of these two groups are 
recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, 
and improve quality of life.  
(1) CF therapies currently available, including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, 
target the downstream consequences and symptoms of the disease. These therapies are 
predominantly generic medicines authorized at a national level, apart from agents for the management 
of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  
(2) CFTR modulators are small molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene. Correctors (tezacaftor, lumacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and 
trafficking of CFTR to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators (ivacaftor) increase 
the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface 
to enhance chloride transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator should result in sufficient 
levels of CFTR at the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating function. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), 
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) are CFTR 
modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations.  
It is believed that, if a CFTR modulator regimen had a large enough effect on F508del-CFTR, then the 
presence of a single F508del allele alone would be sufficient to derive significant clinical benefit. That 
single regimen would be effective in all patients with at least one F508del allele, regardless of the 
mutation on the second allele. If the second allele is also responsive, any benefit derived from that 
allele would be in addition to the substantial benefit derived from the robust effect on F508del-CFTR. 
Importantly, for patients who have one F508del allele and are currently being treated with CFTR 
modulators (i.e. F/G and F/RF patients), their F508del allele seems not being fully leveraged because 
approved regimens primarily target the gating (IVA) or RF (IVA and TEZ/IVA) allele with limited 
modulation of the single F508del allele; these patients too benefit from additional, highly effective 
modulation of their F508del. 
2.2.  About the product 
Kaftrio belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of other respiratory system products with ATC code 
R07AX32. Kaftrio is a triple combination product that contains the CFTR modulators elexacaftor, 
ivacaftor and tezacaftor.  
Tezacaftor, as CFTR corrector, facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR (including 
F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, 
resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator, potentiates the channel- 
open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride transport. Elexacaftor, as a 
next-generation CFTR corrector, also facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR. The

product is considered to have a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action as the 
first generations of CFTR correctors (TEZ, LUM) and potentiator (IVA).  
The combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor results in increased quantity and function of 
CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport, airway surface liquid height, and 
ciliary beat frequency.  
Kaftrio is already registered for patients age 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at 
least one F508del-mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-gene.  
Initially, the applicant applied for an extension to children aged 6 years and older. At the time of the 
initial application, the indication was as follows (the applicant's proposed changes to the indication are 
shown in bold and strikethrough): 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 612 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the 
CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1). 
With the approval of extension of indication II/001 on 26 April 2021 Kaftrio became  indicated “in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 
aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1).” This indication is referred as the “F/Any" 
indication from 12 years onwards. 
In view of this recent approval of the F/Any indication from 12 years onwards, the applicant requested 
an amended indication i.e. Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del 
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1).  
The age-adapted ELX/TEZ/IVA combinations therapy is dosed orally each day in 2 tablets as follows:

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a line-extension to add a new film-coated tablet strength of elexacaftor 50 
mg, tezacaftor 25 mg, ivacaftor 37.5 mg to the already authorised Kaftrio (elexacaftor 100 mg, 
tezacaftor 50 mg, ivacaftor 75 mg) film-coated tablets. This line extension is submitted together with a 
type II variation to extend the indication to children aged 6-11 years. 
Other ingredients of the tablets are: 
Tablet core: hypromellose (E464), hypromellose acetate succinate, sodium laurilsulfate (E487), 
croscarmellose sodium (E468), microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), magnesium stearate (E470b) 
Tablet film coat: hypromellose (E464), hydroxypropyl cellulose (E463), titanium dioxide (E171), talc 
(E553b), iron oxide yellow (E172), iron oxide red (E172) 
The product is packed in a blister consisting of PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC (polyvinyl 
chloride) with a paper backed aluminium foil lidding as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
No module 3.2.S has been submitted within this line extension. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate-release film-coated tablet for oral administration. The tablet is a 
fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the active ingredients elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor.  
As indicated above, the FDC tablet strength introduced with this line extension contains 50 mg of 
elexacaftor, 25 mg of tezacaftor and 37.5 mg of ivacaftor. It is a light orange film-coated tablet, 
debossed with “T50” on one face and plain on the other face. The approximate dimensions are 6.4 mm 
x 12.2 mm.  
The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 50/25/37.5 mg tablets contain the same excipients as the existing 
tablet strength.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except iron oxide yellow and iron oxide red, which comply with EC Regulation 231/2012. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Chemical and physical compatibility of all components of the FDC tablet was demonstrated with an 
open dish stability study at 40ºC /75% RH for 6 months.  
The formulation development was mainly based on the authorised 100/50/75 mg strength. The 
50/25/37.5 mg tablet uses the same core tablet blend as the 100/50/75 mg strength and the tablet 
weight is adjusted to achieve the desired dose. The tablet is coated with a light orange, non-functional 
film coat containing the same components as the film coat used for the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
100/50/75 mg tablet.

A detailed discussion on the age-appropriateness of the finished product for use in children of 6 
through 11 years has not been provided in the quality part of the dossier. No direct safety issues are 
foreseen concerning the excipients and their quantities in the formulation for use in children. All 
excipients have been used previously in the intended age group (such as the Symkevi tablet for 
pediatric populations 6-11 years of age). According to the drug acceptability data provided in module 
5, most children were able to swallow the tablets. The dimensions of the tablets fulfil the requirement 
of the PIP (maximum dimension of 14 mm). 
The proposed dissolution methods for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are the same as per 
authorised 100/50/75 mg tablets. In general, they have been shown to be suitable for the 50/25/37.5 
mg strength as well. Extensive (multivariate) studies have been carried out to demonstrate the 
discriminatory power of the three methods including data on the statistical significance of the studied 
process parameters and/or material attributes. The discriminatory power of the routine dissolution 
methods has been further substantiated by a batch with a core hardness above the IPC limit which 
does not meet the acceptance criterion for routine dissolution testing of the three active substances. 
Keeping in mind that the proposed dissolution methods have been previously approved for the 
100/50/75 mg strength, the provided data on the discriminatory nature of the methods is considered 
sufficient.  
The manufacturing process development section is largely identical to that of the authorised 100/50/75 
mg strength. The manufacture of the FDC tablets uses a continuous manufacturing (CM) process, 
starting with the introduction of formulation components and ending with film-coated tablets. The FDC 
product was developed using dry granulation on Vertex’s CM platform known as the Development and 
Launch Rig (DLR). This section comprises an overview of the applied CM process, operational 
considerations such as segregation points and residence times of product keys in specific sections of 
the equipment train allowing the removal of a sufficient number of adjacent product keys in case of 
non-conformance, process controls including the final blend potency NIR method, the Quality by 
Design (QbD) approach and the design space development.  
All principles of CM (for the stages intragranular blending, extragranular blending, compression, and 
film-coating) have been explained in the dossier. The general approach is described, providing a high-
level process schematic and narrative. The proposed process is a hybrid process, with the majority of 
integrated unit operations being run in continuous mode, with batch mode start (initial mixing) and 
finish (primary packaging). The registration batches were manufactured at a batch size of 60 kg using 
the continuous process. In the continuous process, material is tracked using the Product Key (PK) 
concept. The PK is the smallest unit of material that can be segregated and has been defined. It is 
explained that specific PKs having in-process controls (IPC) results outside the acceptance criteria will 
be removed from the process; there are two 2 segregation points in the continuous process, allowing 
for removal of non-conforming PKs. Specific aspects of the process are discussed in more detail, 
including process and equipment design considerations, feedback loops, segregation points, etc. The 
loss-in-weight feeders, blenders, roller compactor, tablet press and tablet coaters are critical to 
product quality. Specific operational considerations are also discussed: start-up, shut-down and 
segregation approach. 
The CM process control strategy consists of 4 levels, each of which are discussed: unit operation 
control(s) to set point(s), design space monitoring, IPC and product specification. Automated feedback 
loops are used to drive each unit operation towards manufacturing set-points. Process parameters and 
design space limits are monitored in real-time, and any excursions are detected and alerted in real-
time. In-process controls and limits are defined, as is the finished product specification. 
A key part of the control strategy is the ‘typical final blend potency’ IPC method, which consists of two 
parts: LIW feeder data and a NIR method to control homogeneity and potency of the blend prior to

compression. The model used in the NIR method is a PLS-LDA model used qualitatively. The NIR model 
principles, development and validation, maintenance and life-cycle management are all discussed. The 
model is critical to product quality and is considered a high-impact model. The NIR method was 
developed for the authorised 100/50/75 mg strength and was extensively discussed during the 
marketing authorisation application of the authorised 100/50/75 mg strength. The same blend is used 
for the proposed 50/25/37.5 mg strength and the dossier of the proposed 50/25/37.5 mg strength is 
largely in line with the outcome of the discussions for the authorised 100/50/75 mg strength. A post-
approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been proposed to manage changes of the NIR 
model. This PACMP is in line with the EMA Addendum to EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009 Rev 2: 
Defining the Scope of a NIRS Procedure. 
The manufacturing process development initiated with a material risk assessment. Experimental 
designs were conducted in a multivariate manner for the granulation and compression unit operations. 
Separately, a unit-operation specific experiment was conducted for the film coating process. 
After the criticality assessment, the design space was defined.  
Differences in the outcomes of the DoE studies, as well as the resulting differences in the design space, 
fixed parameters and IPC limits between the 100/50/75 mg and the 50/25/37.5 mg tablets have 
adequately been discussed by the applicant. The main reason for the differences in the outcome of the 
DoE appears to be the narrower desired manufacturing range for the compression force of the lower 
strength. The other differences are explained by different settings of the line rate, spray rate, and 
spray time. 
The batches used in the clinical studies were manufactured according to the finalized manufacturing 
process and composition and are representative for the commercial product. 
The container closure system for the FDC tablets is the same as used for the 100/50/75 mg strength. 
It consists of a thermoform blister consisting of a clear Aclar (PCTFE – polychlorotrifluoroethylene) film 
laminated to PVC (polyvinyl chloride) film and sealed with a blister foil lidding. The Aclar/foil blister 
configuration will be placed into an appropriate secondary container. All packaging components are 
suitable for their intended use and comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. 
The intended commercial batch size and the commercial line rate have been defined As in the existing 
tablet strength, both tezacaftor and ivacaftor active substances are incorporated into the FDC tablet 
formulation as amorphous spray-dried dispersion (SDD), whereas elexacaftor is incorporated as a 
crystalline solid. 
The manufacturing process starts with the intra-granular (IG) blending of the excipients in a batch 
mode, followed by the continuous manufacturing process which comprises: feeding and IG blending of 
the actives and IG excipients; dry granulation and milling; extra-granular (EG) blending of granules 
and EG excipients; compression, and coating (which can also be performed in an offline mode). The 
primary packaging is subsequently conducted on a batch mode. 
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process.

A flow diagram depicting the CM part including segregation points as well as critical process 
parameters, process parameters, and in-process controls has been provided. A schematic of the DLR 
configured for dry granulation has also been provided, outlining equipment types and testing points 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. Design space limits are as per those 
defined in the manufacturing process development section and the ranges stated are as per evaluated 
desired manufacturing ranges. Process parameter set points represent those studied or fixed during 
development. Coating can be carried out in an online or offline mode. The same sequence and process 
parameters are used for both modes. The available development data, the proposed control strategy 
and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space, NOR 
and set points. 
Comprehensive information is provided regarding process controls. The summary of critical process 
parameters (CPPs), PP and IPCs is in line with that presented in the manufacturing process 
development section. IPC methods are discussed, as are mass flow and the NIR method. The NIR 
method is a qualitative method, used to discriminate between samples inside and outside the limits of 
the range (95 and 105%). This range reflects the proposed assay in the finished product specification. 
The model justification is extensive and is intended to ensure that adequate variability is incorporated. 
The content uniformity method defined in 3.2.P.5.2 of the eCTD is used for reference analyses. Model 
validation considers ICH Q2 and the EU NIR Guidelines. The model is considered high impact, directly 
affecting product quality. 
A continuous process verification (CPV) approach to validation has been implemented for the 50 mg 
elexacaftor / 25 mg tezacaftor / 37.5 mg ivacaftor FDC tablet. A The DLR is a highly automated CM line 
that will be used for commercial manufacture. A comparison between clinical batches manufacturing 
details and the one used for routine commercial manufacture has been presented. Process 
performance understanding is further supported by conducting development (QbD) experiments on the 
same continuous manufacturing line (DLR) and by using multivariate analysis to link process 
parameters to product CQAs and to define design spaces within which product quality is assured. 
Process parameter and IPC data are collected and reported continuously throughout manufacture, both 
for the purpose of process monitoring and control. Process capability has been demonstrated through 
the analysis of in-process control variability, which has informed the sampling plan and frequency, as 
well as through the analysis of process parameter variability, which has demonstrated the ability of the 
process to operate within design space limits. Furthermore, there is a thorough understanding of 
product quality during start-up and shutdown, as well as before and after pauses. The residence time 
distribution on the DLR has been characterised; procedures are in place to allow segregation of all 
potentially impacted material. The high level of process understanding obtained from development 
work and clinical manufacture experience on the DLR, together with the high level of process 
interrogation during each batch, justifies completion of process performance qualification (i.e. process 
validation via continuous process verification) via manufacture of two commercially representative 
batches. Successful completion of these batches according to the requirements in the (VMP) will 
conclude PPQ. Commercial manufacture will continue following an assessment of the PPQ batches. 
Overall, it has it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process. 
As indicated above, a post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been proposed to 
manage changes of the models used for IPC of the Kaftrio FDC tablets during the lifecycle of the 
product. All model updates will be managed in line with EMEA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009 Rev2, 
Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) by the Pharmaceutical Industry and the 
Data Requirements for New Submissions and Variations. This is acceptable.

In the original submission, a second PACMP to manage changes of the finished product design space 
and addition of manufacturing sites was proposed. In line with the outcome of the application for the 
100/50/75 mg strength, this second PACMP has been withdrawn. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications are appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification  (IR),  assay  of  each  of  the  active  substances  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution of each of the active substances (HPLC), water content 
(KF) and microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli).  
The proposed finished product specification is identical to that of the authorised 100/50/75 mg 
strength, with the only difference in the tablet debossing and tablet coating colour.  
Acceptable justifications have been provided for omitting tests for the physical form, chiral purity, 
residual solvents, elemental impurities, and nitrosamines in the finished product specification. The 
potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. using both the Option 1 and 
Option 2b approach, concluding that all Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities in the tablets will be 
consistently below 30% of the established PDEs and no additional controls are required. This is in line 
with the conclusions for the authorised 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg product and considered sufficient. 
Confirmatory testing of representative batches including three commercial elexacaftor active substance 
batches, ten commercial tezacaftor active substance batches, nine commercial ivacaftor active 
substance batches, four commercial tezacaftor SDD batches, and four commercial ivacaftor SDD 
batches confirmed that the content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities is consistently below 
30% of the ICH Q3D (R1) Option 1 limits. The content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities 
were also shown to be below 30% of the ICH Q3D (R1) Option 1 limits for all tablet excipients with the 
exception of Opadry Orange film coating system. For Opadry Orange, the Option 2b summation 
approach was employed to demonstrate that the maximum daily intake of each elemental impurity is 
well below 30% of its respective permitted daily exposure. Based on the risk assessment and the 
presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity 
controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is 
satisfactory.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substances or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods are identical to those used for the 100/50/75 mg strength. The methods have 
been adequately described and validated. Reference standards have been sufficiently described. 
Batch analysis results have been provided for four batches used in the clinical studies with a batch size 
of 60 kg. The results demonstrate compliance with the release specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  (12 
months), 30°C/75% RH (12 months), and 40°C/75% RH (six months) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of Kaftrio are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  HPLC  assay  (three  actives),  HPLC  degradation  products,  chiral 
purity, dissolution (three actives), XRPD physical form (1. elexacaftor; 2. tezacaftor and 3. ivacaftor), 
KF  water  content,  water  activity,  and  microbiological  quality  (TAMC,  TYMC,  E.coli).  The  analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes or trends have been identified at any storage condition.  
Photostability of one 50/25/37.5 mg commercial scalebatch was evaluated per ICH Q1B Option 2. 
Tablets and covered control samples were exposed at not less than the ICH minimum for UV (320 – 
400nm) and visible (400 – 800nm) light. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation 
products and chiral purity. No changes were observed in the exposed tablet samples as compared to 
the covered control, confirming that Kaftrio FDC tablets do not require light protective packaging. 
Forced degradation studies have not been separately performed for the 50/25/37.5 mg product, but 
only for the 100/50/75 mg product. The results of these studies are considered representative for the 
50/25/37.5 mg tablets. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. Magnesium stearate is of 
vegetable origin. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The development of the 50/25/37.5 mg tablets to treat children aged 6-11 years, 
is largely based on the already authorised Kaftrio 100/50/75 mg film-coated tablets. For instance, the 
same blend and associated continuous manufacturing process and process controls are used for the 
core tablets. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and 
its manufacturing process. A design space has been proposed for the granulation and compression 
step. 
Critical aspects identified during the marketing authorisation application for the authorised strength 
such as the use of a single qualitative NIR PAT method to check the final blend potency prior to 
compression and the ability of this method to correctly identify product keys exceeding the typical 
potency have been addressed in the dossier of the line extension in line with the outcome of the 
objections raised on the authorised strength. Moreover, the same finished product specification, 
container closure system, and shelf life are applied for the line extension. No major quality objections 
have been identified for the line extension.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.

In support of the current line extension, Phase 3 Study 106 in paediatric CF patients was conducted to 
evaluate the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA administered in triple combination in subjects 6 through 11 years 
of age, and to assess if target exposures observed in subjects ≥18 years of age were achieved in the 
younger population with the proposed dosing scheme. 
For patients 6 through 11 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA is proposed to be administered with fat-
containing food as follows: 
• 
• 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h 
Based on the provided Study 106, in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, it was shown that applying a 
30 kg cut-off for the applied normal adult for 50% of the adult dose would result in ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures most similar to exposures in subjects ≥18 years of age while maintaining M23-ELX and M1-
TEZ exposures generally within ranges seen in previous studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA (Table 3). 
Further simulation showed that, when applying a 30 kg cut-off, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures for the <30 kg and ≥30 kg weight group were within the exposure range for subjects ≥18 
years of age. Exposures for subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed ≥30 kg were on the 
higher end of the exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age, whereas exposures for subjects who 
weighed <30 kg were on the lower end of the exposure range (Figure 2). 
The cut-off weight in paediatric patients (30 kg) for Kaftrio is identical to that for Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor).

Although the range of M23-ELX and M1-TEZ exposures in paediatric patients 6 through 11 years of age 
weighing ≥30 kg is somewhat increased as compared to the exposure range in adults and adolescents, 
the exposures of these metabolites are within the range of prior clinical experience. 
In the SmPC section 5.2, PK data for ELX, TEZ and IVA and for active metabolites M23-ELX and M1-
TEZ are presented.

In this paediatric application, a lower dose Kaftrio tablet is included (i.e., ELX 50/TEZ 25/IVA 37.5 mg 
FDC tablet as compared to the ‘adult’ ELX 100/TEZ 50/IVA 75 mg FDC tablet). In comparative 
bioavailability Study 011, exposures of ELX, TEZ, and IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-inf or 
Cmax when the study drug was administered as 2 low-dose ELX 50/TEZ 25/IVA 37.5 mg FDC tablets 
or 1 ELX 100/TEZ 50/IVA 75 mg reference tablet. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no new pharmacodynamic studies submitted. However, the pharmacological parameter 
sweat chloride (SwCl) was studied in the main pivotal study; the results are presented and discussed 
in below sections of this report (see clinical section).  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In support of the current line extension, Phase 3 Study 106 in paediatric CF patients was conducted in 
order to evaluate the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA administered in triple combination in subjects 6 through 
11 years of age, and to assess if target exposures observed in subjects ≥18 years of age were achieved 
in the younger population with the proposed dosing scheme. 
For patients 6 through 11 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA is proposed to be administered with fat-
containing food as follows: 
• 
• 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h 
The results of Study 106 demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 years of age the distributions of 
individual ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures were within the range of those observed in subjects ≥18 years 
of age. Further, the M23-ELX exposures were within the clinical experience of ELX/TEZ/IVA, and M1-
TEZ exposures were generally consistent with the expected clinical experience of ELX/TEZ/IVA and 
TEZ/IVA. 
In conclusion, updated PK data for ELX, TEZ and IVA and for the M23-ELX and M1-TEZ metabolites 
reflecting clinical activity have been included in the SmPC section 5.2 as requested and agreed by 
CHMP. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off are appropriate 
for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age.

Title of Study : A Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA Triple Combination Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age (study 
VX18-445-106) 
Methods 
Figure 3 shows the study design of part A. Subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) were planned for 
enrolment. A review of safety, tolerability and available PK data was completed by an internal Vertex 
team after Part A to confirm the doses for Part B. 
Figure 2 Part A Study Design 
Figure 4 shows the study design of part B. 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study 
drug could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (enrolment was based on the 
eligibility criteria specified within the Open-label Extension Safety Study protocol). 
Figure 3 Part B Study Design 
The Safety Follow-up Visit was scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 days) after the last dose. This visit 
was not required for subjects who enrolled in an optional open-label extension safety study within 28 
days of the last dose. 
Study Participants 
The in- and exclusion criteria were identical for parts A and part B 
Main Inclusion criteria

requirements  
Main Exclusion criteria  
•  History of any illness or any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could 
confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug(s) to 
the subject. This included, but was not limited to, the following: 
•  Clinically significant cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension. 
•  Solid organ or haematological transplantation. 
•  Alcohol or drug abuse in the past year, including, but not limited to, cannabis, cocaine,

•  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
•  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥3 × ULN 
Treatments 
Part A 
The ELX dose of 100 mg qd selected for evaluation in Part A was determined based on population-PK 
modelling utilizing data from adults and simulating exposures over a range of body weights typical for 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
 
a population of 6- to <12-year-olds, ranging from 15 to 50 kg. Based on the simulations, an ELX dose 
of 100 mg qd was predicted to provide exposures that would not exceed the exposures observed in 
adults dosed with 200 mg qd. Hence, the ELX 100-mg qd dose was predicted to be safe and was 
evaluated in Part A for all subject weight groups. 
Part B 
• 
ELX Dosage 
Subjects in the higher weight range were administered ELX 200 mg qd. The appropriate weight cut-off 
for the switch from 100 mg qd to 200 mg qd was determined based on population-PK modelling that 
was updated with preliminary PK data from Part A and data from studies conducted in adult and 
adolescent CF subjects.  
• 
TEZ and IVA Dosages 
TEZ was administered as 50 mg qd and IVA was administered as 75 mg every 12 hours (q12h) in all 
subjects in Part A and in subjects weighing <30 kg in Part B. In Part B, doses of TEZ 100 mg qd and 
IVA 150 mg q12h were administered in subjects weighing ≥30 kg. The dosages and weight cut-off 
were selected based on an evaluation of PK and safety of TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 to 11 years of age 
in Part A of Study 661-113.  
Table 4 Parts A and B Doses 
Treatment modification, interruption and discontinuation 
Modifications of the study drug dose were prohibited. Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, individual 
subjects were withdrawn from the study and dosing ceased. 
• 
Liver Function Tests 
In subjects who interrupted study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator resumed the 
study drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for the interruption. The medical monitor 
was to be notified. 
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, were followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central 
laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and 
bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject could not return to the site for confirmatory testing, 
the use of a local laboratory was permitted.  
Study drug administration was interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the 
following criteria were met: 
o  ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
o  ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 27/91 
 
 
 
 
  
o  ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice.  
A thorough investigation of potential causes was conducted, and the subject was followed closely for 
clinical progression. 
Study drug administration was discontinued if the following criteria were met: 
o  Subsequent ALT or AST values confirmed the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative aetiology was identified, regardless of whether 
transaminase levels had improved.  
All subjects in whom treatment was discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) had these levels monitored closely until levels normalized or returned to baseline. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice was identified, study drug administration was permitted to resume once transaminases 
returned to baseline or were ≤2 × ULN, whichever was higher. Regardless of the duration of the 
interruption, the medical monitor was notified prior to resumption of the study drug.  
Upon resumption of the study drug, transaminases and bilirubin were assessed weekly for 4 weeks. 
If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurred within 4 weeks of 
rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 
72 hours), then the study drug was permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
•  Rash 
Individuals who developed a generalized rash were monitored closely. Study drug dosing was 
interrupted if a subject developed a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that was 
considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator notified the medical monitor of any rash 
that resulted in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher or was an SAE. Investigators were to 
consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count with differential, 
liver function tests [LFTs]), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator 
could consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate.

Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), 
multiple-breath washout, and other events related to outcome (e.g., pulmonary 
exacerbations [PEx]) 
Exploratory: Faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) to assess 
exocrine pancreatic function 
Spirometry 
The following measured spirometric values were converted to percent predicted values using the 
standard equations of GLI: FEV1 (L), forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), FEV1/FVC (ratio), and forced 
expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (L/s). 
Multiple-breath Washout (N2-MBW)  
The final LCI value at each visit was the value provided by the LCI vendor based on the replicates. 
During the Screening Period, the MBW test could be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other 
visits, all MBW tests were performed “pre-bronchodilator”  
Drug Acceptability Assessment 
The acceptability of study drug was assessed by the investigator and authorized designee through the 
Modified Facial Hedonic Scale. 
Subjects were observed for their facial expressions, and the reaction was scored using a visual analog 
scale; any spontaneous comments in regard to likes or dislikes were also noted. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Part B 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 29/91 
 
 
 
 
Approximately 56 subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) were planned for enrolment to ensure 
approximately 45 subjects completed Part B. Target enrolment was approximately 25 subjects with 
F/MF genotypes and 20 subjects with F/F genotypes.  
As all subjects were treated identically, no randomization was planned. 
This was an open-label study. However, subjects and their legally appointed and authorized 
representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) were not informed of their study-related spirometry and 
LCI, sweat chloride (SwCl), faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) results 
during the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the subject permanently discontinued treatment. 
Statistical methods 
• 
PK Analyses 
Individual concentration values of each analyte (ELX, TEZ, IVA, and relevant metabolites) were listed, 
and summary statistics for concentrations of each analyte were presented.  
• 
Efficacy and PD Analyses 
Part A 
Efficacy was not an objective of Part A. Descriptive statistics based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) were 
summarized for spirometry; SwCl; and weight, height, BMI, and their respective z-scores. 
Part B 
As efficacy is a secondary objective of the study, there was no multiplicity adjustment; all P values are 
considered nominal. 
Table 5 describes the main efficacy analyses based on the FAS. Each continuous efficacy and PD 
endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures that included visit as the 
fixed effect, with the baseline value of the efficacy variable and genotype group (F/F or F/MF) as 
covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy variable up to Week 24 (inclusive), 
whether assessed on treatment or after treatment discontinuation.

•  Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses were conducted for Parts A and B separately, based on data from the corresponding 
Treatment-emergent (TE) Period in the Safety Set (Table 6). The overall safety profile of the study 
drug was assessed in terms of the following safety and tolerability endpoints: treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory values, standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, 
and ophthalmologic examinations. All AEs were coded according to MedDRA and were classified as pre-
treatment, treatment-emergent, or post-treatment. Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed; 
no statistical testing was performed. For the results, discussion, and conclusions in this clinical study 
report, TEAEs are referred to as AEs.

Conduct of the study 
Data lock 
The date of data lock for Study VX18-445-106 (Study 106) Part A was 21 February 2019 and for Part B 
was 24 August 2020. 
Changes in study protocol 
The study protocol was amended twice. 
o  Changes in the SAP 
There were no changes to the SAP. The current SAP Version 3.0 is dated 11 August 2020.  
o  Changes in Study Conduct Due to COVID-19 
Vertex implemented safety measures to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue participation 
in Study 106 Part B while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure through 
travel; the conduct of Part A was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These operational 
adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of 
subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP and minimizing 
impact to study integrity.  
Implemented measures were enabled based on the country and local regulations and site-level 
considerations (e.g., whether sites had subjects actively participating in Study 106, or site closures 
due to COVID-19). 
In particular, subjects who missed the Week 24 visit were requested to return and complete an 
unscheduled visit to capture safety laboratory testing missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well 
as any AEs related to laboratory testing. If feasible, efficacy data (spirometry, SwCl, and LCI) were 
also collected at the same unscheduled visit, but this was not mandatory. 
In addition to their usual review of central laboratory data, investigators were responsible for reviewing 
local laboratory data to identify potential AEs. These data were entered into this database if all 
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory certification) were received; available local laboratory data 
were provided in individual subject listings.

An additional prespecified analysis was performed that included home-assessed spirometry (i.e., 
spirometry assessed independently by the subjects at home) that was permitted due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The MMRM results for the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the main 
analysis: Absolute change through Week 24 LS mean (SE) is 10.7 (1.2). 
Another prespecified analysis included all clinic-assessed spirometry data collected through completion 
of study participants using the extended analysis visit windows (i.e., including data from unscheduled 
visits that were conducted after Week 24 to capture safety laboratory testing missed due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic). The MMRM results for the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the 
main analysis: Absolute change through Week 24 LS mean (SE) is 10.2 (1.3)). 
•  Absolute Change in SwCl From Baseline Through Week 24 
Part A 
On Day 15, the within-group mean (SD) change from baseline in SwCl was -50.9 (13.1) mmol/L.

completion of study participation, including at unscheduled visits after Week 24. The MMRM results for 
the through Week 24 endpoint were consistent with the main analysis.

•  Drug Acceptability Assessment Using Modified Facial Hedonic Scale 
Clinic-assessed results of the drug acceptability assessment (subject reaction) using the modified facial 
hedonic scale at Week 24 showed that the majority of subjects either “liked it very much” or “liked it a 
little” at Week 24; results were similar at other evaluation time points.  
Ancillary analyses 
Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH provided additional analyses of the within-group change 
through week 12, with all week 16 and week 24 data excluded from the analysis.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The results of Study VX18-445-106 (Study 106) have been submitted to support an indication 
expansion of ELX/TEZ/IVA to include CF patients 6 through 11 years of age.  
Study 106 is a phase 3, multicenter study conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous 
for F508del and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F 
genotype).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In Part A of study 106, patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg FDC tablet and 
IVA 75 mg tablet for 15 days 
In part B, patients were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks according to the following schedule: 
• 
• 
subjects <30 kg: ELX100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/ IVA 75 mg q12h 
subjects ≥ 30 kg: ELX200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study 
drug could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (if they met the eligibility criteria for 
that study). 
Similar modification, interruption and discontinuation rules as well as prohibited medication rules are 
applied as for the adults in the marketing application studies and are acceptable. 
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (part A) and to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA through Week 24. Efficacy was a secondary objective.  
Endpoints 
As safety is the primary objective in Study 106 Part B, the proposed secondary efficacy endpoints are 
acceptable. Sweat chloride as a pharmacodynamic parameter is an important parameter for measuring 
the effect of a modulator. In CF, sweat chloride is increased and a decrease can be considered as an 
effect on the underlying pathology. Pulmonary function tests, spirometry and multiple breath wash-out 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 53/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(MBW) for calculating LCI2.5, are considered important to measure an effect on the lungs, one of the 
most important affected organs in CF. The LCI2.5 can measure changes in the small airways, while the 
ppFEV1 is more associated with large airways. In CF, the small airways are earlier affected than the 
large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the 
more preserved lung function in children than in adults. 
CFQ-R measures the quality of life, and changes in BMI z-score and height z-score inform over the 
nutritional status. Thus, all parameters inform about a different aspect of CF and are considered 
valuable.  
Statistics 
As study 106 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding 
was done. Considering, that acceptance of an extension of the indication could be based on similar 
exposure and safety and efficacy as in adolescents and adults, a within-group change from baseline is 
considered acceptable to provide evidence of comparable efficacy with adolescents and adults.  
Each continuous efficacy and PD endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures that included visit as the fixed effect, with a baseline value of the efficacy variable and 
genotype group (F/F or F/MF) as covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy 
variable up to Week 24 (inclusive), whether assessed on treatment or after treatment discontinuation. 
For part B, safety measures were implemented to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue 
participation while ensuring their safety against COVID-19 exposure in alignment with Health Authority 
guidance. However, the adjustments made to comply with Health Authority guidance due to COVID-19 
potentially impact the results of the study results. Overall, the impact on safety results is expected to 
be minor provided that all the safety parameters were collected, but at a different time. For the 
efficacy data (i.e. spirometry, SwCl, and LCI) the impact is greater, because it was not mandatory to 
collect these data at the same unscheduled visit. Giving patients the option to provide efficacy data 
through an unscheduled visit during the COVID-19 pandemic may have introduced additional biases 
because the ability and willingness to provide efficacy data during an unscheduled visit is likely to be 
associated with the health of the patient at the time.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of the study drug, and 64 (97.0%) 
subjects completed treatment and the study. One subject discontinued due to an AE, and 1 subject 
withdrew consent (not due to AE).  
The mean population age was 9.3 years, and over half (59.1%) of the subjects were female. The 
majority of subjects (87.9%) were White, and none were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 29 (43.9%) 
subjects had an F/F genotype, and 37 (56.1%) subjects had F/MF genotypes, with 15 distinct F/MF 
genotypes represented. About 50% of the patients has already an impaired lung function, as can be 
expected with these F/MF and F/F mutations, that affect the organs already in early life. 
Of the study population, 78.8% of the patients did not use a modulator before. For the patients with 
F/MF mutations, no modulator therapy is currently authorised under 12 years of age. However, for 
patients with F/F mutation, TEZ/IVA and LUM/IVA are available as modulator therapy, although 
TEZ/IVA became only quite recently available. As a consequence, the group of patients with F/F 
mutation consist of modulator experienced F/F subjects and modulator naïve F/F subjects.  
Outcomes and estimation  
Assessment report

Page 54/91 
 
 
 
 
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, the outcomes of the efficacy parameters were results 
compared to baseline.  
For the main secondary parameter ppFEV1, the LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through Week 24 was 10.2% (95% CI: 7.9, 12.6; P<0.0001). This is generally similar to the results 
for the adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies. In these studies, 
LS mean difference from baseline was 14.3 (95% CI 12.7, 15.8) in patients with F/MF mutations and 
7.8%, (95% CI 4.8,10.8) for CFTR modulator experienced F/F patients and 13.2%, (95% CI (8.5,17.9) 
for CFTR modulator naïve F/F patients. The benefit was thus different between the specific subgroups 
in the adult population, but still clinically relevant. Generally, lung function is better preserved in 
children compared to adults. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit would be acceptable. However, as 
normally a decrease in ppFEV1 will occur, an increase of 10.2% is undoubtfully clinically relevant. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through 
Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2; P<0.0001). This result is in line with results for the 
adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies: LS mean difference from 
baseline -42.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.0, -40.4) in patients with F/MF mutations and LS mean difference 
from baseline was -43.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -46.9, -40.0) for patients with F/F mutations. A reduction of 
10 mmol/L in SwCl has been accepted by the CHMP as clinically relevant. The within LS mean absolute 
change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI: 4.7, 9.2; P<0.0001) was clinically 
relevant, but less impressive compared with results for the adolescent and adult patients in the original 
marketing authorisation studies (patients with F/MF mutations 20.2 points (95% CI 17.5,23.0) and 
patients with F/F mutations 17.4 points 95% CI 11.8,23.0)). However, in children, the quality of life 
was somewhat less impaired at the start (80 points) compared with the adults and adolescents (68.3 
points and 70.6 in study 102 and study 103 respectively). Moreover, the child version is not completely 
identical to the adult version. Furthermore, COVID-19 could also have influenced the outcome of the 
CFQ-R. Nevertheless, an increase of 7.0 points is above MCID of 4 points. Therefore, the results are 
considered clinically relevant. 
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease 
from baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -1.71 (95% 
CI: -2.11, -1.30; P<0.0001). The use of absolute change from baseline is preferred, because this 
endpoint will not mask deteriorations over time, if happened. The additional analysis performed at the 
request of the CHMP of the LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 at week 12 showed that the change was 
-1.93 (95% CI -2.31, -1.56).  
A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is currently not established. Therefore, 
an effect larger than the natural variability might be regarded as clinically relevant. As the natural 
variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 unit4 or 15 % of baseline5, the results are considered relevant by CHMP.  
Subgroup analyses for different patient groups showed that ppFEV1 and SwCl were somewhat better in 
the F/F patients, while the results of LCI2.5 were better in the F/MF patients. The results of both 
populations are generally in line with the overall group. The improvements were in both groups 
clinically meaningful. 
Not all of the 66 participants included in the FAS had data available at all time points because baseline 
results did not meet the criteria of acceptability. A requested multiple imputation-based method to

account for these data if these four patients had any post-baseline data available were consistent with 
the primary analyses that excluded subjects with missing baseline. 
Regarding the post-baseline data, it is acknowledged that all reasonable efforts to collect data given 
the COVID-19 pandemic were made. However, despite the effort, the collection of data on the 
endpoints at week 16 and week 24 was hampered by the pandemic. At week 16, e.g. ppFEV1 data 
were available for 29 patients and at week 24 data were only available for 15 patients under the usual 
follow-up schedule and for 24 patients when patients who participated in an unscheduled visit were 
included. The inclusion of patient data from unscheduled visits is likely to introduce bias into the 
estimate of the outcome as these data may be from healthier, lower-risk patients. It is also noted that 
some of these data were collected much later than 24 weeks.  
Based on the accumulating evidence from previous studies, it is accepted that the effect of a modulator 
can already be observed around 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. At the request of the CHMP, rather 
than using additional analyses to try to reach a reasonable estimate of the within-group change 
through week 24, additional analyses excluding all Week 16 and 24 data were performed, that were 
consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD 
score, and LCI2.5, and that demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements. Because of 
the many missing data and the potential bias for the 24 weeks results, it was considered by CHMP that 
both the results for 12 weeks and 24 weeks needed to be included in the SmPC section 5.1.  
Some patients also had missing data up to week 12. Given the very high reported rate of study and 
treatment completion, it is not immediately clear why these data were missing. For the sensitivity 
analysis, given the way the missing categories were defined, only 2 participants would have been 
allocated to the missing category 1, for which it was assumed that the mean response at a particular 
timepoint was the lower quartile of the observed data. The other participants had missing data imputed 
based on the mean of the observed data. Therefore, this sensitivity analysis is essentially making the 
same (MAR) assumptions as the MMRM model. Because the efficacy endpoints are secondary to the PK 
results and the lack of a control group, this limits the options for further sensitivity analysis and 
additional sensitivity analyses were not requested. Instead, at the request of the CHMP, to support the 
analyses provided at week 12, the Applicant provided the missing data patterns for the FAS population 
up to and including week 12, and where available, provided justification for these missing data, 
considered acceptable. Given the strength of the effect in both the week 12 and week 24 results, and 
the low number of “Category 1” discontinuations, no further analyses are considered required by 
CHMP.  
Upon request from CHMP, sub-analyses for the F/F and F/MF patient groups were presented by the 
MAH. The populations F/F and F/MF were comparably represented in the overall population. The results 
of both populations are generally in line with the overall group. The improvements were in both groups 
clinically meaningful. 
Indication 
The investigated population of patients with F/MF genotypes or F/F genotype is tighter than the 
population for which in a recent line extension Kaftrio was granted a positive opinion by the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/C//005269/II/0001 approved on 26 April 2021). In this procedure, the indication was 
broadened to include CF patients  from the age of 12 years with F/RF and F/G mutation to the already 
registered CF patients with F/F and F/MF mutations, resulting in the current indication of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 56/91 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide justification to discuss possible broadening of the 
indication in patients from 6 years of age, in patients with MF mutations to patients with F/Any 
mutations. 
Principle of Extrapolation 
The expansion of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients as has been accepted for the indication 
expansion of Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) (EMEA/H/C/004682/X/0015). 
Consistent with the principles described in ICH E11, extrapolation of efficacy from adults to a younger 
population-based on comparable PK exposures and safety is acceptable, because the disease process 
in CF patients of all age groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is 
targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA. The defect of the defective chloride channels is already present at birth. 
Because ELX/TEZ/IVA targets the dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy is expected to be 
comparable in younger age groups compared to adults.  
Extrapolation of efficacy is also supported by previously demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies of 
CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age treated with other CFTR modulators (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA), 
which was comparable to the effect observed in adults.  
This is also outlined in the EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) that describes the requirements of the application of the 
(partial) extrapolation, i.e., confirmation of the dose by PK study in children and bridging of safety and 
efficacy data in children.  
In conclusion, the further extrapolation to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF 
mutation is acceptable based on the same arguments as for the CF patients with F/F and F/MF 
mutations in combination with the additional evidence of the statistically significant benefits of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA over previously available CFTR modulators (IVA or TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of 
age with F/RF and F/G genotypes. (reference to EMEA/H/C//005269/II/0001 approved on 26 April 
2021). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The results in the efficacy endpoints generally support a benefit in the investigated population. 
However, the results are impacted by missing data because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related 
restrictions during the later stage of the study. As known from previous trials, by week 12, steady and 
reliable results can already be observed. The analyses excluding all Week 16 and 24 data, were 
consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD 
score, and LCI2.5, and demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements.  
The extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old who are heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype) is 
based on the principle of partial extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients. The 
principle of partial extrapolation can be considered justified in CF for the CFTR therapies, because of 
the similar underlying genetic, and molecular aetiology of CF of children and patients ≥ 12 years. 
Children and adults share the same disease characteristics although they are more severe in adults 
because of the progression of the symptoms. Efficacy is a secondary objective in this application. The 
extrapolation is based on comparable exposure and safety. 
Further extrapolation of efficacy data in CF patients with F/F and F/MF mutations to CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF mutation is acceptable considering also the additional

evidence of the statistically significant benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA over previously available CFTR 
modulators (IVA or TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of age with F/RF and F/G genotypes. 
The extension of indication is acceptable by CHMP as described below: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in 
patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1). 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA has previously assessed in the clinical trial in patients aged ≥ 12 
years.  
The main clinical safety database to support the application in children aged 6-11 years includes the 
safety data from Study 106, a Phase 3, single-arm, multi-centre study conducted in 2 parts (Parts A 
and B) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age who are homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype) or heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF genotypes).  
Only the results of paediatric study VX18-445-106 are reported. No integrated safety report has been 
provided including the comparison with the adult/adolescent safety database.  
Patient exposure 
Study VX18-445-106 consists of two parts. In Part A of study VX445-106, all patients received the 
same dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA. In part B, the patients received a weight-based posology based on the 
provided PK data of Part A.  
Part A  
A total of 16 subjects received at least 1 dose of the study drug in the Part A treatment period. The 
mean (SD) exposure was 14.9 (0.68) days (Table 24). 
Part B  
A total of 66 subjects received at least 1 dose of the study drug in the Part B Treatment Period, with a 
mean (SD) exposure of 23.8 (3.0) weeks (Table 25).

Adverse events 
Adverse events part A and part B 
The AEs generated in study VX-445-106 are briefly summarized in Table 24. During the study, there 
were no deaths reported. A total of one patient experienced serious AEs (pneumonia, 
metapneumovirus infection, and rhinovirus infection), and one patient experienced an AE (rash 
erythematous) that led to discontinuation. Two patients experienced AEs (one patient rash maculo-
papular; one patient diarrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting), that led to interruption of treatment (Table 26).

A subject with multiple events within a category is counted only once in that category. 
Table is sorted in descending order of frequency of the ELX/TEZ/IVA column by System Organ Class, and by Preferred Term 
within each System Organ Class. When summarizing number of subjects with related TEAEs, TEAEs with relationship of related, 
possibly related, and missing are counted. 
Adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events of special interests were AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs, rash and ocular lens 
opacity.  
−  Elevated Transaminase Events 
In part A, one subject (1/16, 6.3%) with a history of liver function test increased had a nonserious AE 
of transaminases increased 1 day after the last dose of study drug treatment; the AE was considered 
by the investigator to be mild in severity and possibly related to study drug  
In Part B, most patients had ALT and AST levels that remained in the normal range. Seven (10.6%) 
subjects had elevated transaminase events. All these events were mild or moderate in severity. None 
of the events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
-  Rash Events 
In part A, five subjects (5/16, 31.3%) had a total of 6 rash events. One subject had an AE of maculo-
papular rash that led to study drug interruption. 
In part B, sixteen (24.2%) subjects had at least 1 rash event. One subject had a rash event of 
moderate severity that led to treatment discontinuation. 
-  Ophthalmologic examinations (Part B).  
Ophthalmologic examination occurred at screening and at the end of treatment. No subjects had AEs of 
cataract or lens opacity.  
Not all patients of part B underwent a post-treatment ophthalmologic examination because of the 
COVID pandemic. The number of patients that underwent ophthalmologic examination before and after 
treatment is not reported.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
During the study VX 445-106, one SAE occurred in Part B of the study in one subject. The event was 
assessed as moderate in severity and unlikely related to study drug, did not lead to study treatment 
discontinuation or interruption, and resolved. This event is considered unlikely to be related to 
treatment.

No deaths occurred during the study.  
Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
Part A 
In part A, there were no trends observed in the Liver Function Test and non-Liver Function Test 
chemistry parameters. No subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN in the TE Period, nor total bilirubin >2 × 
ULN. 
Part B 
In part B, most subjects had ALT and AST values that remained within the normal range. Mean 
concentrations of LFT parameters were variable, with no consistent trends over time in ALT, AST, ALP, 
or GGT values 
Seven (10.6%) subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, and 1 (1.5%) subject had ALT or AST >5 × ULN; 
no subjects had ALT or AST >8 × ULN. No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with concurrent total 
bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN (Table 31) 
Most subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range (Table 31); One (1.5%) 
subject had 2 AEs of blood bilirubin increased, neither of which were serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation or interruption, one of which was considered possibly related to treatment. 
No subjects had AEs of GGT increased, or ALP increased, although the lab assessment showed 
elevations of GGT and ALP above threshold values in n=8 and n=19 patients respectively (Table 31).

Note: Within each parameter, a subject was counted in all applicable post-baseline categories based on the worst 
assessment during the TE Period in Part B. Percentages were evaluated as n/N1. Threshold criteria involving 2 LFT 
parameters could be determined by assessments at different visits during the TE Period 
Creatine Kinase 
The mean CK concentration was variable over time; overall, increases from baseline were observed. 
The mean (SD) increase in CK ranged from 30.2 (32.7) U/L at Week 12 to 53.4 (68.8) U/L at Week 24  
Most subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range; a total of n=21 (31.8%) had CK 
levels > ULN to ≤ 2.5 ULN, N= 4 (6.1%) subjects had CK levels >2.5 × ULN, and no subjects had CK 
levels >5 × ULN.  
AEs of CK elevation occurred in 2 (3.0%) subjects, in one patient it was considered to be related to 
medication (Table 30). Neither AE was serious or led to study drug discontinuation or interruption, and 
both AEs resolved without treatment. 
Haematology 
Minor decreases from baseline in mean platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils were observed: mean 
values of these parameters were not below the respective normal range at any assessed time point.  
Two subjects had mild AEs related to haematology findings (1 subject with leukopenia, 1 subject with 
white blood cell count increased); none of the AEs were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or 
interruption. 
Coagulopathy  
There were no trends observed in coagulation parameters. Three subjects had AEs related to 
coagulation findings considered not to be related to treatment; none of the AEs were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Vital signs  
All patients in part A, and a total of n=33 patients in part B (50% of safety data set) completed the 
safety measurements (blood pressure, ECG) at the end of the treatment period. 
Decreases from baseline in pulse rate were observed. The mean (SD) decrease in pulse rate ranged 
from -1.8 (10.9) bpm at Week 16 to -4.8 (13.6) bpm at Week 4. There were no other trends observed 
in other vital signs parameters, including BP. No subjects had AEs related to Blood pressure or pulse 
rate findings.  
One subject had an AE of defect conduction intraventricular, which was nonserious, not related to 
study drug, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption; no other subjects had AEs 
related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
All patients in part A completed the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 66/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One patient (n=1, 1.5%) in part B discontinued prematurely due to an erythematous rash of moderate 
severity that was considered related to treatment. The study drug was withdrawn, and a single dose of 
cetirizine was administered. The event resolved the next day.  
Treatment interruptions due to AEs  
The treatment was temporarily interrupted in two patients, one in part A and one in part B.  
In part A, one (6.3%) subject had an AE of rash maculo-papular of mild intensity that led to treatment 
interruption. The AE resolved; the subject resumed ELX/TEZ/IVA and also completed dosing. The AE 
was considered unrelated to treatment.  
In part B, the treatment was temporarily interrupted in one patient because of AEs, unlikely to be 
related to medication. The dose of ivacaftor was interrupted for one day and the event resolved.  
Comparisons of the safety profile in patients aged ≥ 12 and patients aged 6-11 years old  
In response to the LoQ, the applicant provided a comparison of the adverse events observed in the 
paediatric population (children aged 6-11 years) and the patients aged ≥ 12 years  
The safety data for the paediatric population is obtained in study 106 part B. The safety for the 
patients aged ≥ 12 years is obtained in study 102. As both studies were of the same duration, the 
comparison of the AE incidence data is provided.  
Comparisons overall safety profile  
The overall adverse event profile by number of AE’s, treatment related AE, discontinuations etc.  show 
a comparable number of events are comparable between the paediatric population and the patients 
aged ≥ 12 years (Table 32).

SOC General disorders and administration site conditions 29% vs 16%  
In the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal adverse events, the largest difference in the AE 
(PT) is shown by the PT cough 42% vs 17%, nasal congestion (15% vs 9%), oropharyngeal pain (~ 
18% vs 10 %) and rhinorrhoea (~12% vs 8%). 
In the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions, the differences between the 
paediatric and ≥12 year old population (29% vs 16%) is driven by the higher reported frequency of 
pyrexia (21 % vs, 8%). In the paediatric population, none of the adverse events were considered 
being related to study medication. 
The SOC Investigations showed a higher reported frequency of the PT blood creatine phosphokinase 
increase in the population aged ≥ 12 years (9.4% vs 3%) compared the paediatric population

Differences in frequency of drug related adverse events  
Upon request, on overview of the drug related adverse event was provided. 
In the paediatric population, most drug related AE’s were reported In the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders (18.2%), followed by the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (16.7%), SOC 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.1%) and SOC investigations (10.6%). 
For the ≥12 year old population, this frequency was SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal 
disorders (14.4%), SOC investigations (12.9%), the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (10.9%), and Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (8.9 %). 
Regarding the SOC investigations, the paediatric population reported a higher frequency of 
treatment related ALAT increased compared with the ≥12 year old population (7.6 %vs 5.9 %)) , while 
the PT (ASAT increased 1.5 vs 5.4.%) and blood bilirubin increase (1.5% vs 3.0 %) were lower than 
reported in the ≥12 year old population.

The patients in study 102 are aged ≥ 12 years, in study 106 aged 6-11 years. Selection of the SoC and PT is based 
on the drug reported AE in study 106B and the incidence of n≥ 2 in study 102.  
Adverse event of Specific Interest 
Adverse events of special interests were AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs, rash and ocular lens 
opacity. As none of the paediatric patient had an AEsi of ocular opacity, this will not be discussed 
further here.  
AESI transaminase elevation  
A cross study comparison of the AESi of transaminase elevation is provide in  
Table 35. The data show, that the occurrence of the AEsi (ALAT or ASAT ≥ 3 × ULN) were 
slightly higher in the paediatic population (10.6%) compared with the patients ≥ 12 years 
(7.9%). None of the paediatric patients reported ALT>3 × ULN or AST>3 × ULN) and TBILI>2 
× ULN (Table 35).

AESI Rash  
The generalised AEsi Rash included the PT Rash, PT Rash generalised, Rash macular, Rash pruritic, 
Rash erythematous, Rash maculo-papular and Rash papular. 
The paediatric population showed an approximately 2 times higher reported frequency reported than in 
the ≥ 12-year-old population for both AEsi-Rash-irrespective-of-causality (24.2% vs 10.9%), and the 
AEsi-Rash-treatment-related (12.1% vs 6.9%). 
Postmarketing experience 
As of 20 October 2020, it is estimated that 23,556 patients (representing 13,467.1 person-years) have 
been exposed to ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
In April 2021, the applicant submitted a type II variation to update the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet to include hepatic safety data for Kaftrio (EMEA/H/C/005269) 
(sequence 0031) and Kalydeco (EMEA/H/C/002494). This  assessment was  performed in parallel of 
this application.  
The request for the update for the SmPC was initiated by Vertex post-marketing pharmacovigilance. 
The post-marketing pharmacovigilance showed 3 cases of liver injury characterized by concomitant 
transaminase (ALT and AST) elevations >3 × ULN and total bilirubin elevations >2 × ULN were 
reported, including 1 case of liver failure leading to transplantation in a patient with pre-existing 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data set to support the application in children aged 6-11 is provided by part B of the 
single-arm, open-label study VX18-445-106, where 66 patients were treated for 24 weeks.  
The provided safety data set to support the application is considered limited to support a substance 
intended for chronic use. Also, because of COVID pandemic, not all patients underwent a full safety 
measurement after completion of the study. In addition to its limited data set size and treatment 
duration, the safety data is collected in an uncontrolled, open-label study, in which the contribution 
from the longer disease duration is hard to distinguish from the longer drug exposure. Therefore, a 
cross study comparisons were provided upon request from the CHMP of the safety profile obtained in 
the paediatric population and the patients aged ≥ 12 years to support the safety profile obtained in the 
paediatric population. 
Overall, the provided paediatric safety set showed that the treatment appears to be well tolerated up 
to 24 weeks in the paediatric population, as shown by the reported low number of serious adverse 
events (1.5%), treatment interruptions (1.5%) and treatment discontinuations due to AE (1.5%). 
Similarly, to the patients aged ≥ 12 years, the treatment appears well-tolerated and the safety profile 
is overall consistent with the known safety profile of Kaftrio.  
There is an open-label extension roll over study 107 currently ongoing which should provide an 
opportunity to collect the missing safety data. This study will provide more prolonged safety data (up 
to 96 weeks), but the included paediatric patients number will still be limited (n=64). The data will 
need to be submitted once the study is completed. 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 73/91 
 
 
 
 
 
Nearly all paediatric patients (98.5%) experienced an adverse event. The reported adverse events 
were most likely related to the common manifestation of CF disease or common illnesses.  
About 50% of patients experienced an adverse event that was considered to be related to treatment 
by the investigator.  
A different ranking in the number or treatment related adverse events was observed between the 
paediatric and ≥ 12-year-old population. In the paediatric population, most drug related AE’s were 
reported In the SOC Gastro intestinal disorders (18.2%), followed by the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic 
and Mediastinal disorders (16.7%), SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.1%) and SOC 
investigations (10.6%). 
For the population aged ≥ 12 years, most drug related AEs were observed in the SOC Respiratory, 
Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (14.4% ), followed by the SOC investigations (12.9%), the SOC 
Gastro intestinal disorders (10.9%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (8.9 %). 
This ranking of the SoC is on the one hand not unexpected, as the population aged ≥ 12 years suffers 
more from advanced pulmonary disease, while in the paediatric population gastro-intestinal symptoms 
might be more prominent. However, the data may also indicate that paediatric population might be 
more vulnerable to skin related adverse events.  
Some new treatment-related adverse events were noted in the paediatric population. These adverse 
events were mostly of mild intensity and could also be considered as signs and symptoms of CF or 
other as symptoms of common disease manifestations (e.g., vomiting, cough, sputum increased, 
bronchospasm, haemoptysis, nasal congestion, pleuritic pain, rhinorrhoea, wheezing, bilirubin 
increased, aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, and fatigue). Most of these events were reported as 
related or possible related to a single subject, mild to moderate in intensity and resolved upon ongoing 
use of ELX/TEZ/IVA. Therefore, they should not be mentioned in the ADR table of section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  
Cough (n=28) and sputum increased (n=3) were reported in more subjects in the paediatric 
population. However, these CF related adverse events were not reported with a higher frequency in the 
≥12-year-old population compared with placebo. Therefore, the CHMP considered that they do not 
need to be included in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Adverse events of special interest  
In the adult and adolescent trials, identified adverse events of specific interest were transaminase 
elevation, rash and ocular lens opacity. These adverse events of interest also apply to the paediatric 
population.  
Transaminase elevations 
Transaminase elevations occur frequently in paediatric patients with CF and the inclusion of patients 
with transaminase elevation was limited to patients with ALT or AST < 3 × ULN. During the trial, the 
patients were regularly monitored. The reported incidence of transaminase elevation was (10.6%), in 
none of the patients did it lead to treatment discontinuation or treatment interruption.  
The cross-study comparison with the safety data obtained in the patients aged ≥ 12 years showed a 
slightly higher incidence of transaminase elevation with the paediatric population (10.6 %) compared 
with the patients aged ≥ 12 years (7.9%). Unlike the patients aged ≥ 12 years, none of the paediatric 
population showed ALT>3 × ULN or AST>3 × ULN) and TBILI>2 × ULN (Table 35). 
The cross-study comparison with the safety data obtained in the Symkevi trials (9.2%) and Orkambi 
trials (12.6%) revealed a comparable incidence of transaminase elevation (10.6%). However, these 
cross-study comparisons are hampered because of the more stringent the exclusion criteria in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 74/91 
 
 
 
 
 
Kaftrio trials and of the longer observation period for Symkevi trials. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA trials, 
patients were excluded when one out of the defined impairments were present instead of 2 (Symkevi) 
or 3 (Orkambi) trial, while the observation period for Symkevi was extended to 48 weeks.  
Therefore, the indirect cross study comparisons indicate that the risk of AESI-transaminase-elevated 
might be somewhat higher with Kaftrio compared to other CTFR modulators. Hepatoxicity is an 
important identified risk. Recently, the SmPC was amended to include a warning for frequent 
monitoring of ASAT/ALAT and bilirubin. At present, this risk appears to be sufficiently addressed, 
considering that the paediatric patients are treated in specialized clinics and will be frequently 
monitored. 
Rash 
Similarly to the adult and adolescent studies, treatment-related rash occurred frequently (n=8, 12.1% 
in part B).  
It resulted in the discontinuation of treatment in one patient in part B of the study.  
The cross-study comparison with the adult and adolescent data revealed that frequency of rash 
in the paediatric population was twice the frequency reported in the patients aged ≥ 12 years  
for both the AESI Rash-irrespective-of-causal-relationship  (24.2 % vs 10.9 %), as well as the 
treatment-related Rash ( 12.1 % vs 6.9%). The current SmPC reports the AE-rash already as a 
very common adverse drug reaction (≥ 10%) in section 4.8. Therefore, no adjustment to the 
SmPC appears to be necessary.  
Ocular lens opacity 
None of the patients reported AEs related to ocular lens opacity. However, ocular lens opacities occur 
gradually and as such might be underreported. Therefore, patients must be examined before and after 
treatment. However, the study was conducted in the COVID-19 pandemic and not all patients 
underwent a post-treatment ophthalmic examination. Most patients (n=64) rolled over to the open 
label extension study 107, which also includes ophthalmic examinations. The results of this study will 
be awaited.   
Incomplete safety measurements at end study due to COVID-19 pandemic  
The study took place during the COVID pandemic, which might explain that no complete safety 
assessment including vital signs, ECG and ophthalmic examination was conducted in the complete 
safety population.  
Data from 33 patients (50% of safety data set) were provided for the vital signs and ECG, while an 
unknown number of patients’ results are provided for the additional ophthalmologic examination. The 
currently provided data do not raise concerns but are too limited to be conclusive. Nevertheless, the 
generated paediatric safety database can be supported with the generated safety profile obtained in 
patients aged ≥ 12 years, while additional long-term safety data will be provided (> 24 weeks) from 
the long-term roll over study 107.   
2.7.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA is intended for chronic use. The provided paediatric safety data set is limited, both in 
patient numbers (n=66) and duration of treatment i.e., 24 weeks. In addition, the safety data is 
obtained in an uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm study in which the contribution from the longer 
disease duration versus the longer drug exposure is hard to distinguish.  
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 75/91 
 
 
 
 
The current safety data show that the treatment appears to be well tolerated in patients from 6 years 
of age, however it is noted that the AESI Rash occurred twice more often in younger children 
compared to the older population.    
The transaminase elevation occurred with comparable incidence in the paediatric population as for 
older patients aged ≥ 12 years. It is an important identified risk and the SmPC contains sufficient 
recommendations for frequent monitoring.  
In conclusion, the currently provided data set shows that the product is generally well tolerated, but 
the safety set is of limited duration (24 weeks) for a product intended for chronic use. Therefore, the 
additional long-term safety data obtained from study 107 should be provided once the data becomes 
available (by Q1 2023).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene that result in the absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the 
cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation 
of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs 
results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Lung disease is the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in people with CF. F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation 
(84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% of the individuals in Europe)6,7. 
In this current variation, the following indication was initially claimed: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in 
patients aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with 
a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1). 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the treatment of CF, two main types of therapies can be distinguished, i.e., CF therapies that target 
the symptoms of the disease (such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics), and  CFTR 
modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) that maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk 
of infections and exacerbations; and improve quality of life.  
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
mutant CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced 
chloride transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR 
which is delivered to the cell surface (by correctors).  
Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) is indicated in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older 
who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) gene. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations.  
The Kaftrio currently approved indication is for patients aged 12 years and older covers F/F genotypes, 
F/MF ‘minimal function’ genotypes, F/G ‘gating’ genotypes, and F/RF ‘residual function’ genotypes.  
In children 6 through 11 years of age, approved modulator therapies are available for F508del 
homozygous patients (F/F), patients heterozygous for F508del and a specific residual function mutation 
(F/RF) or a specific gating mutation (F/G). Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure the disease and 
more efficacious treatments could fulfil this gap in these patients. For the populations heterozygous for

F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) no treatment is available, which is an unmet need in 
this subpopulation. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
To support an extension of the indication of ELX/TEZ/IVA to include CF patients 6 through 11 years of 
age with F/F or F/MF mutation, the efficacy and safety data of one clinical trial, study VX18-445-106 
are submitted. The pharmacokinetics of ELX/TEZ/IVA is also investigated in study 106 that confirmed 
the dosing.  
Study 106 is conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function mutation (F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype).  
Study 106 Part A evaluated ELX 100 mg once daily (qd)/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg every 12 hours 
(q12h), which is half the dose that is approved for use in CF patients ≥12 years of age. Simulations 
were conducted to select a dosing regimen and the updated popPK models, which included PK data 
from adults, adolescents, and all Study 106 to confirm the proposed dosing regimen for Study 106 Part 
B.  
Study 106-part B evaluated the safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in 24 weeks. The recommended 
total daily dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA for patients 6 through 11 years of age was evaluated, i.e.  
• 
• 
Patients weighing ≥30 kg: ELX 200 mg/TEZ 100 mg/IVA 300 mg 
Patients weighing <30 kg: ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 150 mg 
The primary objective was safety; efficacy was secondary objective.  
The secondary endpoints included spirometry and sweat chloride (SwCl), weight, height, body mass 
index (BMI) and associated z-scores, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), multiple-breath 
washout.  
The extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients. Consistent with the principles 
described in ICH E11 and EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018), extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger 
paediatric patients may be possible when a medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric 
patients for the same indication as those studied in older paediatric patients, the disease process is 
similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable. In CF, the disease process in all age 
groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA 
and because ELX/TEZ/IVA targets the dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy is expected to be 
comparable in younger age groups compared to adults. Pharmacokinetic studies in the relevant age 
groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the medicinal product, together with safety studies, may 
be sufficient to provide adequate information for paediatric use.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dosing 
The results of Study 106 and popPK based simulations demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 
years of age the distributions of individual ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures, applying a dose of ELX 
100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h dose in patients <30 kg and a dose of ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 
100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h in patients weighing ≥30 kg, were within the range of those observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021

subjects ≥18 years of age. Further, the M23-ELX exposures were within the clinical experience of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, and M1-TEZ exposures were generally consistent with the expected clinical experience of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA. 
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off for the applied 
dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
Efficacy  
For the main secondary parameter ppFEV1, the LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through Week 24 was 10.2 percentage points (95% CI: 7.9, 12.6; p<0.0001). This is generally similar 
to the results in the adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies, when 
LS mean difference from baseline was 14.3 (95% CI 12.7, 15.8) in patients with F/MF mutations and 
7.8%, (95% CI 4.8,10.8) for CFTR modulator experienced F/F patients and 13.2%, (95% CI (8.5,17.9) 
for CFTR modulator naïve F/F patients.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through 
Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2; p<0.0001). These results are in line with results for 
the adolescent and adult patients in the original marketing authorisation studies (LS mean difference 
from baseline -42.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.0, -40.4) in patients with F/MF mutations and LS mean 
difference from baseline was -43.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -46.9, -40.0) and for patients with F/F mutations.  
The within LS mean absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score of 7.0 points (95% CI: 4.7, 
9.2; P<0.0001) was relevant, but less compared with results for the adolescent and adult patients in 
the original marketing authorisation studies (patients with F/MF mutations 20.2 points (95% CI 
17.5,23.0) and patients with F/F mutations 17.4 points 95% CI 11.8,23.0)).  
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease 
from baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -1.71 
(95% CI: -2.11, -1.30; P<0.0001). The natural variability for the LCI2.5 is 1 unit8 or 15 % of 
baseline9. Therefore, the results are considered relevant.  
Upon request from the CHMP, results at week 12 were also provided. The LS mean absolute change in 
ppFEV1 from baseline through week 12 was 9.6 percentage points (95% CI: 7.3, 11.9) and the LS 
mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 12 of -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -
56.1). The within LS mean absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score was 5.6 points (95% 
CI: 2.9, 8.2). The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 12 was -1.83 (95% 
CI: -2.18, -1.49). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients were unable to provide data on the efficacy 
endpoints toward the end of the study. Baseline data also appear to be missing for a small number of 
patients.  
Despite the effort to collect as much efficacy data as possible, collection of data on the endpoints at 
week 16 and week 24 was hampered by the pandemic, and the option to provide efficacy data at an

unscheduled visit that was intended to supplement week 24 data may have introduced bias into the 
estimate of the outcome as these data may be from healthier, lower-risk patients.  
Given the effect of a modulator on some parameters can already be observed around 4 to 8 weeks 
following treatment, additional analyses on the difference in the change through week 12 with all week 
16 and week 24 data excluded from the analysis were conducted for all secondary endpoints. These 
analyses were consistent with the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, 
CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5, and demonstrate a robust and clinically meaningful improvements. 
Based on the information provided on treatment discontinuation, the sensitivity analysis is essentially 
making the same (MAR) assumptions as the MMRM model. The lack of a control group limits the 
options for further sensitivity analysis.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is mainly determined by part B of the study, where 66 patients were treated for 24 
weeks. The most frequently reported AEs (by PT are) were cough (n=28, 42.4%), headache (n=16, 
24.2%) and pyrexia (n=14, 21.2 %).  
Most frequently treatment related AEs were abdominal pain (n=6,9.1%), followed by alanine 
aminotransferase increase (n=5, 7.6%), rash (n=4, 6.1%) and headache (n= 4, 6.1%) 
One patient prematurely discontinued treatment because of an adverse event i.e., rash erythematous. 
In two patients, treatment was temporality interrupted because of adverse events, i.e., 1 rash maculo-
papular and 1 diarrhea, pyrexia, and vomiting.   
Adverse events of specific interest were transaminase elevation and rash. A total of 7 (10.6%) 
paediatric patients experienced elevations of transaminases, and 16 (24.2%) experienced a rash.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main safety data set to support the application is of limited size in patient numbers (n=66) as well 
as in the duration of treatment i.e., 24 weeks. In addition, the safety data is obtained in an 
uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm study, in which the contribution from the longer disease duration 
is hard to distinguish from longer drug exposure.  
Cross-study comparison showed the same frequency of transaminase elevation as with the other CFTR 
modulators Lumacaftor and Symkevi, although the exclusion criteria for patients with pre-existing liver 
function impairments were more stringent in ELX/TEZ/IVA studies compared to the Orkambi trials and 
Symkevi, and a prolonged observation period with the Symkevi trial.  
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an incomplete end of trial 
safety measurement. At the end of the trial, ECG and vital signs were conducted in 33 (50% of safety 
data set) subjects. 
After completion of study 106, patients were invited to participate in the long-term safety study 107 of 
96 weeks duration. A total of 64 patients rolled over. Additional long-term safety data will be provided 
once available (by Q1 2023).  
Assessment report  
EMA/713972/2021  
Page 84/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 of -60.9 mmol/l (95% CI: -63.7, 
-58.2) is also well above the accepted MCID of approximately 10 mmol/l. The results are considered 
clinically relevant. 
Strength of the evidence  
Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an impact on survival in cystic fibrosis and 
reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions of the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of the treatment of cystic fibrosis. ppFEV1 as a surrogate 
endpoint is a well-established endpoint and a reduction in the decline of FEV1 is related to improved 
survival. Observed improvements in ppFEV1 and SwCl were consistent with previous results in adults 
and adolescent populations. The results of ppFEV1 and SwCl are supported by all secondary 
parameters. CFQ-R respiratory domain, BMI z-score showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Results based on analyses using data through week 12 supported conclusions of a clinically meaningful 
effect. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in a clinical trial as in adult studies. The clinical benefit seen 
in the investigated F/MF patients has such a large effect size, that it was accepted that results of in the 
tested MF mutations can be extrapolated to all MF mutations. Moreover, additional studies in adults in 
F/G and F/RF mutations have established that ELX/TEZ/IVA is effective in all classes of mutations in 
the presence of at least one F508del mutation. Although not tested, in children a similar efficacy can 
be expected and extrapolation of efficacy is acceptable from paediatric patients with MF mutations to 
patients with at least one F508Del mutation.  
Safety 
In the adult clinical programs, ELX/TEZ/IVA appeared to be well-tolerated, both in the short term and 
in the long-term safety studies. The reported treatment-related adverse events in the paediatric 
population generally aligned with the reported events in patients aged ≥ 12 years.  
Similarly to patients ≥ 12 years, the AESI rash occurred very frequently. In the paediatric population 
the AEsi Rash occurred twice as often compared with the patients aged ≥ 12 year, however no 
adjustment of the SmPC is needed, because rash is already reported as a very common adverse drug 
reaction. 
The most frequent related AE is abdominal pain (6; 9.1%), followed by alanine aminotransferase 
increased (5; 7.6%).  
In children, hepatic impairment and transaminase elevations appear to occur more slightly more 
frequently (10.6%) than in adults and adolescents (7.9%), but this is acceptable. The cross-study 
comparisons suggest a somewhat higher risk with Kaftrio for transaminase elevations than with other 
CFTR modulators, but head-to-head comparative data is missing.  Like in adults and adolescents, the 
transaminases and bilirubin should be closely monitored, as already mentioned in the SmPC section 
4.4.  
After completion of study 106, patients were invited to participate in the long-term safety study 107 of 
96 weeks duration. A total of 64 patients rolled over. So far, no study report for this trial has been 
submitted to provide extended safety data beyond 24 weeks of treatment.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In this procedure, the extension of the indication to children 6 through 11 years old is based on the 
principle of partial extrapolation from adult and adolescents to paediatric patients. The extension needs 
to be supported by comparable PK exposures, and acceptable safety and a similar PD effect.   
Indication  
The currently investigated population of patients with F/MF genotypes or F/F genotype in study 106 is 
tighter than the population for which Kaftrio was recently granted a positive opinion for the older age 
group, i.e. patients 12 years and older with CF who have at least one F508del-mutation in the 
CFTR-gene.  
Following approval of the above indication in parallel of this application and upon agreement from the 
CHMP, the requested indication was amended to  “combination regimen with ivacaftor for the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del 
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
The further extrapolation to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/G and F/RF mutation is 
justified similarly that for CF patients with F/F and F/MF mutation. Additional evidence provided of the 
statistically significant benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA over previously available CFTR modulators (IVA or 
TEZ/IVA) in CF subjects ≥ 12 years of age with F/RF and F/G genotypes was also provided. 
Dosing  
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations, of 
clinical data from subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults confirmed that from a 
clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 30 kg weight cut-off for the applied 
dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age. 
Efficacy  
In this study in CF patients 6 through 11 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del and a minimal 
function mutation or homozygous for F508del mutation, efficacy was a secondary objective. The 
extrapolation is based on comparable exposure and safety.  
Clinically relevant improvements were found in the changes from baseline for the ppFEV1 and SwCl. 
These improvements were consistent with previous results in adults and adolescent populations, 
confirming the justification of partial extrapolation.  
Although many data were missing for the main statistical analysis, additional analyses on the change 
through week 12 with all week 16 and week 24 data excluded from the analysis were consistent with 
the main analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5, 
and demonstrated a robust and clinically meaningful improvements.  
Safety 
The provided data showed that the treatment appears to be well tolerated in the paediatric population. 
The reported safety profile generally appears similar with the reported data obtained in the population 
aged ≥ 12 years. However, the safety data set was rather small (n=66), of limited duration (24 weeks) 
and is further hampered by missing data at the end of treatment safety follow-up due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The ongoing, extension study 107 will provide additional long-term safety and results will be 
provided upon completion (by Q1 2023).    
Nevertheless, the safety profile of adult patients is well described, and the currently provided data did 
not identify new important risks. As expected, the paediatric population reported the highest frequency

of adverse events in the SoC Gastro-intestinal tract, while in the patients aged ≥ 12 years Respiratory 
events were more frequently reported.  
Similarly to patients ≥ 12 years, the AESI rash occurred very frequently. The elevation of 
transaminases occurred slightly more frequently in the paediatric population compared to patients 
aged ≥ 12 years (10.6% vs 7.9%). Hepatotoxicity is already identified as an important potential risk. 
The earlier introduction of the modulator therapy in younger patients from 6 years of age might be 
beneficial, as this modulator therapy has the potential to prevent the long-standing detrimental effects 
of CF. Considering that these paediatric patients are treated in specialized clinics and frequently 
monitored, more uncertainties regarding the safety profile are considered acceptable and manageable 
in clinical practice. In addition, the safety will be further substantiated in the follow-up extension study

None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kaftrio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP, by consensus, is of the opinion that Kaftrio is not similar to Kalydeco, Symkevi, Bronchitol, 
TOBI Podhaler within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Kaftrio new strength and the extension of the indication is 
favourable for the following indication: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in 
patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP did recommend the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following changes:

Extension application to introduce a new strength of 37.5 mg/25 mg/50 mg Kaftrio film-coated tablets 
grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to include paediatric use (6 to 11 years) in patients with at 
least one F508Del mutation. 
In addition, minor changes have been implemented in annex II according to the latest QRD template.  
The RMP has been updated (version 5.0).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Kaftrio subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0397/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the

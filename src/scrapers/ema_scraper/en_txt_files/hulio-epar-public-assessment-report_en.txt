2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hulio  (FKB327)  is  being  developed  as  a  biosimilar  candidate  to  Humira  (INN:  adalimumab;  ATC  code 
L04AB04).  
The  reference  product  Humira  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  (RA),  Juvenile 
idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  (polyarticular  JIA  and  enthesitis-related  arthritis),  Axial  spondyloarthritis 
(ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), Psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA), Psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque Psoriasis, Crohn´s Disease (CD), paediatric Crohn´s 
Disease, Ulcerative colitis (UC), Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) including adolescent HS and Non-infectious 
Uveitis (UV) including paediatric uveitis in the European Union.  
The applicant is seeking all of the indications and dosing regimens for which Humira is registered in the 
EU. 
The dosage form and route of administration is identical to Humira.  
About the product 
Adalimumab, the active ingredient of Hulio (development code “FKB327”) belongs to the 
pharmacotherapeutic group “immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors” 
(ATC code: L04AB04). Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 type monoclonal 
antibody specific for TNF-α. Adalimumab binds to soluble and membrane associated TNF-α, thereby 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 11/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibiting the interaction of TNF-α with the TNF-α receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 and the resulting 
downstream pro-inflammatory cascade of events, which is considered the primary mechanism of action in 
all indications approved for Hulio. 
Three presentations are being developed:  
• 
• 
• 
40 mg/0.8 ml vial 
40 mg pre-filled syringe 
40 mg pre-filled pen 
Each product presentation contains 0.8 mL deliverable volume of FKB327 (40 mg) at a concentration of 
50 mg/mL. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
During the development of FKB327, the Applicant has received scientific advice from EMA. 
The scientific advice procedures covered questions on the pharmaceutical quality, the non-clinical and 
clinical program.  
In  general,  the  Applicant´s  development  program  to  demonstrate  the  similarity  between  Hulio  and 
Humira is considered adequate and was performed according to the CHMP guidance on similar biological 
products and the recommendations given in the Scientific Advices except for some non-clinical aspects 
(see Section 2.3). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as sterile, single-use, ready-to-use, solution for injection containing 40 
mg of adalimumab as active substance in 0.8 mL deliverable volume at a concentration of 50 mg/mL.  
Other ingredients are: Monosodium glutamate, sorbitol, methionine, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid 
(for pH adjustment) and water for injections.  
The product is available in three presentations: single-use pre-filled syringe (plastic) with safety device, 
in single-use pre-filled pen, and, for paediatric use, in single-use pre-filled vial (type I glass), fitted with 
rubber stoppers, aluminium crimps and flip-off seals. 
Hulio is developed as a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab, AbbVie Ltd.). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The  active  substance  (INN:  adalimumab,  manufacturer’s  code:  FKB327)  is  a  recombinant,  human 
monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1  kappa)  expressed  in  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cells.  FKB327  has  a 
molecular  weight  of  approximately  148  kDa.  Adalimumab  is  comprised  of  two  identical  heavy  chains 
(HCs) and two identical light chains (LCs). One N-linked glycosylation site is located at asparagine-301 on 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 12/141 
 
 
 
 
 
each HC. The main N-linked oligosaccharide structures of FKB327 are asialo, biantennary and fucosylated 
complex type structures containing 0 and 1 galactose residues. 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  adalimumab  is  known  to  be  its  selective  binding  to  human  soluble  and 
membrane bound tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). This neutralises the biological function of TNF by 
blocking its interaction with the cell surface membrane receptors TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75). TNF is a 
naturally occurring cytokine that promotes normal inflammatory and immune responses when bound to 
its  receptor.  However,  overexpressed  TNF-α  has  been  implicated  in  numerous  autoimmune  diseases. 
Blocking the TNF receptors results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways leading to decreased 
cytokine release and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Manufacturing flow charts 
are  provided  for  each  step  of  the  manufacturing  process,  including  critical/key  process  parameters, 
in-process controls, and hold times for process intermediates. The ranges of critical process parameters 
and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity 
and endotoxin, are described for each step. Further detail on the manufacturing process description was 
initially  requested  and  has  been  provided  to  a  sufficient  extent.  The  active  substance  manufacturing 
process is considered acceptable. 
The manufacturing process for the active substance includes steps for cell culture, harvest, purification 
with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation/filtration and ultra-/diafiltration steps. Excipients are 
added and the formulated active substance is stored and transported under appropriate conditions. The 
process has been sufficiently described and in-process controls are adequately set to control the process.  
Reprocessing conditions at the viral removal step and the bulk filling step are appropriately described. In 
addition, a protocol for validation of future reprocessing during commercial manufacturing is provided. 
The  tests  proposed  to  evaluate  the  active  substance  quality  following  reprocessing  are  considered 
appropriate. 
A  detailed  description  of  the  container  closure  system  is  provided.  The  container  meets  the  USP 
requirements for bacterial endotoxins, cytotoxicity testing Class VI, particulate matter, physicochemical 
test for plastics, food contact, and the Ph. Eur. 3.2.2.1 requirements for plastic containers for aqueous 
solutions for parenteral infusion and the requirements of the “Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products” 
(EMEA/410/01 Rev.3). 
Extractable  and  toxicological  assessment  studies  are  performed  to  identify  possible  safety  risks.  The 
proposed  container  closure  system  is  considered  adequately  qualified  and  suitable  for  storage  of  the 
active substance. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the  active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented.  
Recombinant  CHO  cells  expressing  the  monoclonal  antibody  adalimumab  were  established  by 
co-transfection  of  the  expression  vectors  followed  by  genetic  selection.  Generation  and  testing  of  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 13/141 
 
 
 
 
 
expression vectors was described. A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is 
provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB and release of future WCBs. Also end of production (EOP) 
cells  and  cells  at  the  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age  (LIVCA)  were  generated  and  tested.  Genotypic  and 
phenotypic  stability  of  the  recombinant  cell  line  at  and  beyond  the  limit  of  cell  age  are  adequately 
addressed. Foetal bovine serum was used to establish the host cell line and appropriate TSE Certificates 
are provided. No other animal-derived compounds are used during production of FKB327. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
An overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout the active 
substance manufacturing process is given. Information has been provided on the control strategy in place 
to  monitor  and  control  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  with  regard  to  critical,  as  well  as 
non-critical  operational  parameters  and  in-process  tests.  Actions  taken  if  limits  are  exceeded  are 
specified. The overall control strategy is considered satisfactory and is clearly linked to critical quality 
attributes (CQAs). 
Process validation 
The Applicant has taken  a comprehensive, three-stage approach towards process validation. The first 
stage relates to the process development/design and characterisation studies. Information is provided on 
aspects of process establishment in a stepwise approach. CQAs were identified and linked to performance 
attributes.  The  second  stage  relates  to  process  verification,  with  the  conduction  of  formal  process 
performance  qualification  (PPQ)  studies.  The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been 
satisfactorily  validated, 
including 
removal  of  product-  and  process-related 
impurities, 
inactivation/removal  of  viral  and  adventitious  agents,  process  intermediate  hold  time  studies, 
chromatography column resin lifetime studies, UF/DF membrane re-use cycles, media and buffer hold 
time studies, uniformity of bulk filling, reprocessing, and shipping qualification. The third stage relates to 
the ongoing process verification and the maintenance of the commercial production. The overall control 
strategy  is  acceptable.  Consistency  in  production  has  been  shown  on  a  suitable  number  of  full  scale 
commercial  batches.  All  acceptance  criteria  for  the  critical  operational  parameters  and  likewise 
acceptance  criteria  for  the  in-process  tests  are  fulfilled  demonstrating  that  the  purification  process 
consistently  produces  adalimumab  active  substance  of  reproducible  quality  that  complies  with  the 
predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
The active substance manufacturing process was directly developed at the intended commercial scale. No 
substantial  changes  have  been  made  to  the  process  during  development.  Consequently,  all  active 
substance  lots  produced  are  considered  representative  of  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  and 
some of these lots were used in clinical studies.  Comparability studies are thus not needed. 
Characterisation 
The  active  substance  has  been  thoroughly  characterised  by  using  several  active  substance  lots. 
Characterisation  studies  encompass  N-  and  C-terminal  sequencing,  peptide  mapping,  disulfide  bonds, 
analysis  of  glycosylation,  molecular  weight,  isoform  pattern,  extinction  coefficient,  electrophoretic 
patterns,  post  translational  modifications,  liquid  chromatographic  patterns,  spectroscopic  profiles, 
thermal  unfolding  properties,  biological  activity, 
functional  activity  and  characterisation  of 
product-related  variants  in  forced  degradation  studies.  The  characterisation  studies  employed 
physicochemical  and  biological  state-of-the-art  methods  revealing  that  the  active  substance  has  the 
expected structure of a human IgG1-type antibody. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 14/141 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, the studies included in the characterisation are considered relevant, comprehensive and in line 
with  the  requirements  of  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  no.  2031  “Monoclonal  antibodies  for  human  use”  and 
guideline on development, production, characterisation and specification for monoclonal antibodies and 
related products (EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008). Further characterisation data have been presented in 
the biosimilarity assessment. 
Product-related variants are classified as product-related impurities or product-related substances based 
on characterisation and criticality assessment for potential impact on potency, pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
clinical safety.  
As process-related impurities, the Applicant has considered host cell protein (HCP), host cell DNA, other 
specified contaminants and media/buffer components. All process-related impurities were observed at 
consistently low levels. Impurity clearance has been discussed during PPQ validation studies and process 
characterisation studies. Additionally, a summary of safety assessment of process-related impurities was 
provided. 
Specification 
Control  of  the  active  substance  has  been  established  as  part  of  the  overall  control  strategy  based on 
criticality  assignment  of  the  quality  attributes,  process  development  and  validation,  PPQ  lot  results, 
historical data from commercial manufacturing, and stability data. The main aspects comprising quality 
control testing for monoclonal antibodies are covered in line with the relevant guidelines. 
The  specification  is  in  line  with  ICH  Q6B  and  includes  tests  and  limits  for  general  attributes,  identity, 
purity/impurities,  potency  and  microbiological  attributes.  Apart  from  the  routine  release  testing,  the 
CHMP recommends consideration of specified additional characterisation tests in case of relevant changes 
of the active substance manufacturing process.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for batches which were manufactured with the intended commercial process and at 
commercial scale for the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
demonstrate manufacturing process consistency. 
Reference materials 
The  Applicant  provided  detailed  information  on  the  Reference  Standards  used  to  date.  Each  lot  of 
Reference  Standard  was  extensively  qualified  according  to  release  tests  as  well  as  additional 
characterisation tests. Future Primary and Working Reference Standards will be qualified according to the 
same set of release and characterisation tests. The management of Reference Standards is considered 
adequately described. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life in the proposed container when stored at the recommended storage condition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 15/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability data on an appropriate number of batches of active substance from the commercial 
manufacturing process stored in the intended container under real time, under intermediate and under 
accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Appropriate photostability and stress-condition studies have also been conducted.  
No decrease or trends were observed for potency or purity under normal storage conditions. From the 
data currently available, it appears that the active substance is stable at long-term storage conditions and 
does not show any signs of degradation or loss of potency. In addition, the forced degradation studies 
demonstrated that the analytical procedures used for active substance release and stability testing are 
stability-indicating.  
The  Applicant  commits  to  continue  the  ongoing  primary  long-term  stability  studies.  In  addition,  the 
Applicant commits to post-approval long-term stability studies. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 
(6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union), any confirmed 
out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product Hulio is presented as a sterile, single-use, ready-to-use, solution for injection. The 
solution  contains  adalimumab,  monosodium  glutamate  (buffering  agent),  sorbitol  (tonicity  agent), 
methionine  (stabiliser),  polysorbate  80  (stabiliser),  hydrochloric  acid  (pH  modifier),  and  Water  for 
Injections (WFI) (solvent). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) standards; compliance with National Formulary (NF) 
for monosodium glutamate is accepted as there is no monograph for this excipient in the Ph.Eur. The 
excipients used are compendial grade and acceptable There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation and none of them are of animal or human origin.  
Each product presentation contains 0.8 mL deliverable volume of FKB327 (40 mg) at a concentration of 
50 mg/mL. Syringes are filled to ensure that there is sufficient deliverable volume provided from each 
syringe.  Three  product  presentations  are  planned  to  be  commercialised:  Vial  (glass  vial),  pre-filled 
syringe (PFS) and pre-filled pen (PFP), also referred to as auto-injector (AI). 
 The materials of the primary packaging comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. The devices (i.e. PFS and AI) are considered as integral part of the medicinal product and are for 
single use only. Hence, CE markings are not required. The medical devices are adequately described. 
Appropriate, biocompatible materials are used to manufacture the devices. Sufficient design verification 
testing, human factors and risk assessment were performed to ensure proper functioning of the devices. 
The presentations fulfil the needs of adult and paediatric patients alike. 
The function and characterisation of each excipient is provided and is satisfactory. The stability and 
compatibility with the active substance has been adequately discussed. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  composition  differs  from  that  of  the  reference  product  which  contains 
mannitol, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. However, characteristics of the formulation and the 
rationale for the selected excipients have been adequately discussed; development studies supporting 
the formulation rationale have been adequately discussed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 16/141 
 
 
 
 
 
The finished product formulation is the same as the one used during the clinical development.  
Comparability  of  products  used  during  clinical  development  and  intended  for  commercialisation  is 
accepted. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) has been defined for each presentation. This is followed by a 
summary  of  the  CQAs  identified  based  on  the  QTPP.  For  the  vial  product  format  an  evaluation  of  the 
criticality of manufacturing process steps and process parameters by risk analysis is summarised. Process 
parameters  associated  with  each  identified  critical  control  point  have  been  summarised  and  linked  to 
particular relevant CQAs according to a clear rationale. Process characterisation is described for which a 
risk  assessment  was  conducted  to  identify,  prioritize  and  mitigate  risks  associated  with  process 
parameters to be characterised. Each of the manufacturing stages were characterised either by off line 
studies or from historical manufacturing data. Adequate details of the studies and their results have been 
provided.  The  process  development  supports  the  proposed  manufacturing  process  description  and  its 
controls.  For  the  PFS/AI  product  formats  the  methodology  and  approach  in  evaluating  criticality  for 
manufacturing process parameters is similar to that already seen for the active substance.  
It can be concluded that the pharmaceutical development is described in sufficient detail and is generally 
acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  in  each  case  is  a  non-standard  aseptic  process  normally  associated  with 
biological  product  manufacture.  Manufacture  includes  formulation  and  fill  finish  activities,  and  an 
adequate control strategy is defined. The material is sterile filtered, filled and sealed. For the PFS/AI the 
PFS is assembled with the safety device or the pen administration device. The manufacturing process has 
been validated by manufacture of an appropriate number of full scale commercial batches. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. Data from shipping validation 
studies has been provided. 
Product specification 
The specifications for Hulio 40 mg vials, PFS and AI for commercial batch release and throughout the 
specified shelf-life include identity, purity, potency and other general tests.  
Control of the finished product has been established similarly as for the active substance.  
Analytical methods 
The  validation  data  for  analytical  methods  is  acceptable.  Appropriate  validation  of  device  specific 
functionality testing has been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of an appropriate number of lots of the finished product were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
Please refer to the active substance section. The same reference standards are used for control of the 
active substance and finished product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months for all product presentations when 
packaged in the proposed container closure system, protected from light, and stored at 5 ± 3°C as stated 
in the SmPC is acceptable. 
For the vial, finished product real time/real condition stability data and data for product stored under 
accelerated conditions were provided on a suitable number of lots. In addition, data from batches exposed 
to stress conditions, including photostability studies and forced degradation studies as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, were provided. The batches of 
the vial finished product used for the stability studies are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
For  the  syringe  presentations  (PFS  and  AI)  real  time/real  condition  stability  data,  and  accelerated 
condition  data  on  an  appropriate  number  of  lots  were  provided.  In  addition,  accelerated  and  stress 
condition data, including photostability and forced degradation studies as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products,  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  PFS 
finished product used for the stability studies are representative of those proposed for marketing as both 
container closure systems have the same primary packaging and the same stability profile. 
From the data available, the finished product appears stable at long-term storage conditions and does not 
show any signs of degradation or loss of potency. 
The results from the photostability study indicate that the product is sensitive to light and consequently 
the SmPC states that the product should be kept in its outer carton in order to protect from light. 
The pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a 
period of up to 14 days. This is supported by the accelerated stability data provided. 
The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing long-term stability studies. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union), any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur 
and EMA. 
Biosimilarity 
The general approach for evaluating biosimilarity is acceptable and in line with the current guidelines on 
biosimilarity. This includes justification of the number, age and disposition of batches used, the kind of 
tests performed, and justification of the use of active substance versus finished product of Hulio in the 
comparative analysis.  
The evaluation of similarity required a bridging study between EU approved Humira (Humira (EU) and US 
licenced  Humira  (Humira  (US))  to  demonstrate  that  Humira  (US)  is  representative  of  the  reference 
product  (Humira  (EU)).  Humira  (US)  was  used  as  comparator  throughout  the  Phase  III  clinical 
development program.  
An overview of the tests included in the comparability studies and the key findings is provided in Table 1. 
Multiple  batches  of  FKB327,  Humira  (EU)  and  Humira  (US)  were  tested  where  the  parameters  were 
expected to show variability between the products. A subset of the reference product lots were tested for 
the measurement of visible and sub-visible particles, conducted in accordance with the compendial test 
methods. Limited number of lots each of FKB327, Humira (EU) and Humira (US) were tested for primary 
Assessment report

structure and higher order structure which are expected to have little variability. The choice of number of 
lots for each test was adequately justified.  
The  regulatory  assessment  of  comparability  was  made  primarily  on  the  basis  that  measured  quality 
attribute ranges of Hulio should reside within the range of variability observed for the reference medicinal 
product batches.  
For the biosimilarity analysis, the company performed three exercises: i) Hulio versus Humira (EU), ii) 
Hulio versus Humira (US), and iii) Humira (EU) versus Humira (US). In addition, Hulio active substance 
was compared to Hulio finished product. 
The three exercises performed revealed that most of the quality attributes are similar between Hulio and 
Humira (EU). However, differences at the level of the glycosylation profile, charge variants (basic and 
acidic  peaks),  size  heterogeneity  (HMWS,  MMWS,  LMWS),  and  hydrophobic  heterogeneity  have  been 
identified between Hulio and Humira. The Applicant claimed that these differences are minor and do not 
impact the biological functionality based on the comparability data from the in vitro assays: binding to 
soluble TNF-α (ELISA and SPR), binding to transmembrane TNF-α, cytotoxicity neutralising and apoptosis 
assays, ADCC, CDC, binding to C1q complement. This conclusion was initially not endorsed and evidence 
of the sensitivity of these assays to detect meaningful differences in biological activity was requested as 
a  major  objection.  Moreover,  additional  in  vitro  testing/data  was  also  requested  as  part  of  the  major 
objection  in  order  to  further  substantiate  the  claim  of  biosimilarity  between  Hulio  and  Humira,  i.e.  to 
address residual concerns associated with the non-comparability of the analytical data for certain quality 
attributes. 
In response to the major objections, the Applicant provided a comprehensive review of literature data 
justifying the difference in glycosylation between Hulio and Humira (EU). In line with this review, the 
differences were confirmed to have no impact on the primary biological activities through the functional 
characterization. This was supported by further evidence that the sensitivity of the biological assays is 
sufficient  to  detect  any  meaningful  differences  in  the  function  of  Hulio  as  compared  to  Humira  (i.e. 
qualification/validation results of the biological assay methods indicated that all assay methods have high 
precision, accuracy, linearity and specificity) and by additional in vitro bioassay testing through the mixed 
lymphocyte reaction (MLR). This additional assay evaluates the anti-proliferative effect of adalimumab on 
T-cells (via the induction of regulatory macrophages; a potential mechanism of action of adalimumab in 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients) as well as the Fab and Fc function. The Applicant showed that 
Hulio, Humira (EU) and Humira (US) inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and 
that the level of the inhibitory effect on T-cells was similar for Hulio, Humira (EU) and Humira (US) at 
three  different  concentrations.  These  results  further  support  the  similarity  of  Hulio  to  its  reference 
product. 
Hence, it is acknowledged that Hulio is highly similar to Humira (EU) in physicochemical and biological 
properties. No clinically meaningful differences are expected between Hulio and the reference product, as 
further supported by the results of the functional characterization and the clinical studies. In addition, the 
Applicant has successfully demonstrated that Humira (US) is representative of the EU reference product, 
justifying its use as comparator throughout the Phase III clinical development program.

Raw  materials  are  sufficiently  controlled  for  possible  contaminating  viruses.  In-process  testing  is 
performed  on  the  active  substance  harvest  to  screen  for  possible  virus,  mycoplasma  or  microbial 
contamination. The MCB and WCB were adequately qualified and tested for possible viral contamination. 
The active substance manufacturing process contains various steps that were shown to contribute to virus 
removal/inactivation. Virus removal/inactivation was properly validated  
The information provided regarding transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) risk and materials 
of animal or human origin is sufficient and in line with relevant guidelines. 
In  conclusion,  viral  safety  and  safety  concerning  other  adventitious  agents  including  TSE  has  been 
sufficiently assured. 
2.2.4.  Discussion  and  conclusions  on  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

The data provided support biosimilarity versus the EU reference medicinal product (Humira (EU)) at the 
quality level. In addition, the non-EU comparator (Humira (US)) used in pivotal clinical trials has been 
shown to be representative of the EU reference medicinal product.   
A number of incidences of non-comparability versus Humira (EU) were identified in the physico-chemical 
quality data. In addition a lack of data demonstrating sensitivity of the biological assays was identified. 
These  issues  gave  rise  to  a  major  objection.  In  response,  the  Applicant  provided  further  data  and 
justifications to show that the minor differences observed do not impact the biological functionality based 
on the comparability data from the in vitro assays: binding to soluble TNF-α (ELISA and SPR), binding to 
transmembrane  TNF-α,  cytotoxicity  neutralising  and  apoptosis  assays,  ADCC,  CDC,  binding  to  C1q 
complement, and the additional in vitro bioassay testing through the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). 
Further  evidence  that  the  sensitivity  of  the  biological  assays  is  sufficient  to  detect  any  meaningful 
differences was also provided. Hence, it was acknowledged that Hulio is highly similar to the reference 
medicinal product in physicochemical and biological properties and the major objection was considered 
satisfactorily resolved. 
In addition, a major objection was raised during the procedure relating to EU  GMP compliance of the 
active substance and finished product manufacturing sites. This major objection was also satisfactorily 
resolved as the Applicant provided the requested documentation. 
2.2.5.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends a point for investigation: consideration of specified characterisation tests in addition 
to routine release testing, in case of relevant changes of the active substance manufacturing process. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development of FKB327 (Hulio) was performed in accordance with the “Guideline on 
similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010); with the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1) and with ICH guideline S6 (R1) - preclinical safety evaluation of 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of side-by-side studies related to the modes of action of adalimumab were conducted to 
demonstrate the similarity between FKB327 and the reference medicinal product Humira. The studies 
included in vitro evaluation of the Fab- and Fc-related biological activities and additional biological 
properties and in vivo efficacy evaluation in TNF-α Transgenic Mouse Polyarthritis Model to demonstrate 
similarity of FKB327 and US Humira in improving the symptoms of TNF-α mediated pathology.

The similarity of FKB327 to reference product Humira was initially assessed by in vitro Fab-related mode 
of action characterisation studies (neutralization of soluble TNF-α induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells and 
induction of apoptosis in mTNF-α expressing cells), and in Fc-related functions (binding to Fcγ receptor I, 
IIa , IIb, IIIa(F-158 isoform), IIIa(V-158 isoform), IIIbNA1 and IIIbNA2 isoforms and FcRn; binding to 
C1q; ADCC activity and CDC activity in mTNF-α expressing cells).  For receptor FcγRIIa, two isoforms 
(131H and H131R) are described depending on histidine or arginine at position 131 of FcyRIIa.  The amino 
acid substitution arginine to histidine at position 131 is influencing the IgG1 affinity. The applicant 
clarified that the isoform of FcγRIIa used in the similarity assessment and presented in the initial 
application was the Arginine isoform (R 131) only. Considering that both the H or R variants are 
associated with an important role in IBD and in RA, the applicant was requested to provide comparative 
binding of the biosimilar vs reference to H131 as well. Those additional results performed with a qualified 
assay showed that the KD values were comparable, providing an additional confirmation that biosimilarity 
applies for polymorphic forms of FcγRIIa receptors as well.  
The scope of testing is judged sufficient to compare Hulio and Humira.  Testing needs to compare binding 
and functional consequences for each of the Fab and Fc regions and has been done. 
In terms of experimental design, in general, the Applicant adopted an approach of nominating a reference 
batch of Hulio and comparing results with further batches of Hulio and results with Humira EU to results 
with this reference batch.  This reduces the effect of inter-day assay variability or drift, and is supported.  
Testing included comparisons with Humira from US and Japanese markets. 
The in vitro assays were completed by an in vivo efficacy study in TNF-α Transgenic Mouse Polyarthritis 
Model.  No significant differences were seen in arthritic and histopathological scores between FKB327 and 
US Humira at dose levels of 1 and 10 mg/kg at the study termination.  
A post hoc statistical analysis of the arthritis clinical scores at the end of the evaluation (Week 12; 1 week 
after the 5th dose) was conducted by the applicant for both dose levels and showed no statistical 
significance between FKB327 and EU-Humira at either the 1 mg/kg dose (p=0.55) or the 10 mg/kg dose 
(p=0.29). No further discussion was considered necessary by the CHMP. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The studies on secondary pharmacodynamic were not conducted and are not deemed necessary by the 
CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The studies on safety pharmacology were not conducted and are not deemed necessary by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were not conducted and are not deemed necessary by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) data for FKB327 were generated as part of a human 
TNF-α transgenic mouse (TTg mouse) arthritis study, a single dose PK preliminary study in cynomolgus 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 24/141 
 
 
 
 
 
monkeys and a toxicokinetic profile comparison of FKB327 and US Humira in cynomolgus monkeys 
included as part of the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study. Although pharmacokinetics studies are not a 
formal request for a biosimilar, the toxicokinetic analysis was included for development of FKB327 for 
global registration purposes. 
The studies were supported by validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) methods to detect FKB327 and 
US Humira in mouse and non-human primate sera as well as antibodies to these products. Validation 
studies were also presented to support use of those assays to quantify adalimumab and antibodies to 
adalimumab.   
The pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic comparisons did not highlight any marked difference in the 
parameters between FKB327 and Humira. The in vivo pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies were 
however performed on a limited number of animals therefore the applicant cannot claim ‘bioequivalence’ 
between FKB327 and Humira and reference is made to bioequivalence studies conducted in human 
(healthy volunteers and patients). 
The absence of studies evaluating the distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions is consistent with CHMP guidance (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies, EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Full toxicity studies were not considered necessary as FKB327 is a proposed biosimilar to Humira in 
agreement with the CHMP guidelines on similar biological medicinal products, and studies on single-dose 
toxicity were not conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A 4-week comparative repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to support the 
similarity of FKB327 and originator Humira in a reduced toxicology study package for a biosimilar 
application. The comparison of toxicokinetics, local tolerance and potential immunotoxic profiles were 
included to the study. Cynomolgus monkey was selected as a relevant species and were also used in the 
originator studies to investigate the potential toxicities of adalimumab. 
The administered dose was 30 mg/kg. This dose represents a 12-fold safety margin, based on the 
conversion of the dose in monkeys into human equivalent dose corresponding to a 40 mg dose. For doses 
of 80 and 160 mg, the safety margins are 6 and 3; respectively. In terms of exposures, the safety margin 
is approximately 17-18 comparing single doses (compared to a SD of 40 mg in human). 
The weekly administration is twice as frequent as in patients. The selected s.c. route of administration is 
the intended route in humans for administration of FKB327. 
FKB327 and US Humira were well tolerated at a dose level of 30 mg/kg (s.c., once weekly for 4 weeks), 
consistent with the results of originator adalimumab studies in cynomolgus monkeys and without 
unexpected findings. The toxicological assessment revealed no significant or biologically meaningful 
treatment -related effects or treatment-related differences between FKB327 and Humira in clinical 
observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy examinations, electrocardiographs, 
haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry or urinalysis endpoints, or peripheral blood leukocyte

analysis, or macro/microscopic evaluations. There were no safety signals in either drug treatment group. 
Histopathological changes consisting of decreases in positive CD21 immunoreaction in the follicle of the 
spleen and mesenteric and submandibular lymph nodes were noted and were attributed to an 
exaggerated pharmacological effect rather than toxicity. Those changes were comparable among groups.  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were evaluated in the TTg mouse arthritis study and the GLP-repeat dose 
toxicity/TK study. In the TTg mouse arthritis study, most treated animals produced ADA which was 
expected due to administration of a heterologous therapeutic protein. In the monkey, the results showed 
that 1 monkey was positive for ADA at Day 56 in a recovery phase in FKB327 group. The immunogenicity 
seen in animals is however not considered relevant for humans. 
Genotoxicity 
Full toxicity studies were not considered necessary as FKB327 is a proposed biosimilar to Humira in 
agreement with the CHMP guidelines on similar biological medicinal products, and studies on genotoxicity 
were not conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
Full toxicity studies were not considered necessary as FKB327 is a proposed biosimilar to Humira in 
agreement with the CHMP guidelines on similar biological medicinal products, and studies on 
carcinogenicity were not conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Full toxicity studies were not considered necessary as FKB327 is a proposed biosimilar to Humira in 
agreement with the CHMP guidelines on similar biological medicinal products, and studies on reproductive 
and developmental toxicity were not conducted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant provided a justification for not submitting environmental risk assessment studies. FKB327 
is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. This is in accordance with 
the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). This justification was found acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  nonclinical  programme  of  FKB327  included  a  series  of  head-to-head  in  vitro  comparative  studies 
including binding studies and cell based assays for characterisation of Fab and Fc-related effects. An in 
vivo PD (efficacy) study in human TNF-α transgenic (TTg) mouse model of polyarthritis and a repeated 
dose toxicity study including toxicokinetic assessment and the determination of the anti-drug antibody 
(ADA)  development  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  conducted  to  support  the  similarity  demonstration 
between FKB327 (Hulio) and US Humira. The nonclinical in vivo testing strategy was designed to meet the 
requirements for a global development strategy.  
Scientific  advice  was  sought  from  EMA  (initial  advice  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/549582/2013,  19  September 
2013).  The  scientific  advice  concerning  nonclinical  development  was  not  fully  followed.  The  scientific 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

advice indeed recommended using representative drug product batches of FKB327 for the biosimilarity 
exercise. For some assays (TNFα binding assays), drug substance batches only were used. The applicant 
justified that since only an additional amount of methionine is added to the DP during the formulation 
process,  performing  biosimilarity  exercise  using  drug  substance  batches  is  considered  acceptable.  In 
addition,  the  Applicant  was  suggested  during  the  SA  procedure  to  consider  testing  with  NK  cells,  in 
addition to testing with PBMCs as these cells express CD16 and are key for  ADCC.   In the marketing 
authorisation  application  dossier,  the  Applicant  presented  studies  with  NK  cells  and  with  Hulio  drug 
product. 
Safety  pharmacology,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies 
were not submitted and are not required. 
The similarity of FKB327 to reference product Humira was assessed by the in vitro Fab-related mode of 
action  characterisation  studies  (neutralization  of  soluble  TNF-α  induced  cytotoxicity  in  L929  cells  and 
induction of apoptosis in mTNF-α expressing cells), and in Fc-related functions [binding to Fcγ receptor I, 
IIa(H), IIa (R), IIb, IIIa(F), IIIa(V), IIIbNA1 and IIIbNA2 and FcRn; binding to C1q; ADCC activity and 
CDC activity in mTNF-α expressing cells]. From a non-clinical point of view, the above biological function 
parameters were found to be similar between FKB327 and the reference product Humira. 
Slight  differences  were  noted  in  glycosylation  profiles  between  Hulio  and  the  reference  product.  The 
Applicant provided a review of literature data showing that the relative difference in glycosylation content 
between  antibodies  investigated  is  significantly  larger  than  the  one  observed  between  FKB327  and 
EU-Humira  and  these  minor  differences  were  confirmed  to  have  no  impact  on  the  primary  biological 
activities.  This  was  further  supported  by  the  evidence  that  the  sensitivity  of  the  biological  assays  is 
sufficient to detect any meaningful differences in the function of FKB327 as compared to Humira. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) data for FKB327 were generated as part of a human 
TNF-α transgenic mouse (TTg mouse) arthritis study, a single dose PK preliminary study in cynomolgus 
monkeys  and  a  toxicokinetic  profile  comparison  of  FKB327  and  US  Humira  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
included  as  part  of  the  4-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  study.  Although  animal  studies  are  not  a  formal 
request for a biosimilars, those studies have been included for global registration purposes. The results of 
those animal studies were found comparable between Hulio and the reference Humira and were provided 
as supportive information only.  
The Applicant did not submit ERA studies but provided an adequate justification which is in line with EMA 
Guideline  on 
the  Environmental  Risk  assessment  of  Medicinal  Products 
for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the nonclinical biosimilarity and safety data demonstrate that FKB327 has a similar activity to the 
reference product Humira.

____________________________________________________________________________ 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pivotal clinical study program for this MAA includes two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies that 
have been completed in healthy subjects: 
•  Study FKB327-001: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group single-dose study in healthy male 
and female subjects to compare the safety and PK of FKB327 and EU-approved and US-licensed 
Humira (40 mg by sc injection) 
•  Study FKB327-005: A randomized, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study in healthy male 
and female subjects to compare the relative bioavailability of FKB327 (40 mg by sc injection) 
delivered via vial, PFS and AI presentations. 
In addition, the sponsor conducted a Phase 1, healthy subject study in Japan comparing the PK of FKB327 
and US-licensed Humira to enable a local product licence application (Study FKB327-004). A synopsis for 
this study was included in the dossier as it was considered a supportive rather than a pivotal study..   
Bioanalytical methods 
Adalimumab serum concentration measurements   
Adalimumab drug concentration was measured by a sandwich electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) assay. 
The method detected equivalently FKB327 and reference products, EU-approved Humira and US-licensed 
Humira, using a single set of calibrators and quality controls made from FKB327. The lower limit of reliable 
Assessment report

quantification was 100 ng/mL, which is sufficient to detect serum drug concentrations through to the 
terminal phase. 
Evidence of audits of the laboratory where all the bioanalytical assays were performed is provided. For 
Study  FKB327-001,  results  obtained  for  all  parameters  evaluated  during  the  pre-study  validation 
confirmed that the performance of the assay was acceptable for the intended purpose of concentration 
analysis of all analytes (FKB327, EU-approved Humira, and US-licensed Humira). No reanalysis of study 
samples has been made for a pharmacokinetic reason. 
A validated immunoassay method was used for quantification of adalimumab in human serum 
from studies FKB327-002 to FKB327-005.Determination of anti-drug antibodies  
The  Applicant  has  used  several  bioanalytical  methods  for  the  determination  of  anti-drug  antibodies 
(ADAs) and of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from the serum samples from healthy volunteers (studies 
FKB327-001, -004 and -005) and from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, studies FKB327-002 and 
-003). In all of the clinical studies, when ADA screen results are negative, confirmatory assays do not 
need to be performed. As a result the ADA titer and the results of the neutralizing assay are not available 
for  the  samples  found  negative  in  the  first  screening.  For  the  sake  of  analysis  these  samples  are 
nevertheless stated as having a negative confirmatory ADA test.  
An ADA screening test was initially developed and used for the analysis of the clinical samples from study 
FKB327-001.  However,  an  insufficient  drug  tolerance  limits  the  meaning  of  the  results.  The  high 
proportions  of  inconclusive  samples  drive  an  uncertainty  on  the  actual  proportions  of  the  positive 
samples. As a result, no sound conclusion can be drawn on the relative immunogenicity of FKB327 versus 
Humira  for  the  study  FKB327-001.  Because  these  ADA  and  NAb  assays  were  only  used  in  the  study 
FKB327-001 and because ADA or NAb were not included as a covariate of the ANCOVA model used to 
conclude  the  bioequivalence  between  all  3  treatments  in  the  study  FKB327-001,  this  issue  was  not 
pursued by the CHMP.  
Before initiation of the Phase 3 program, the design/operating conditions of both the ADA and the nAb 
assays  were  modified  to  improve  detection  sensitivity/drug  tolerance.  These  methods  were  used  for 
detection of ADA/Nab for the studies FKB327-002, -003, -004 and -005 and were considered adequate by 
the  CHMP.  For  the  clinical  study  FKB327-002  and  -003  with  RA  patients,  due  to  the  presence  of 
rheumatoid factors (RF) in the RA study patients in pre-dose samples, the Applicant has re-determined a 
new screening for the ADA assay format. It is 20 fold higher than the anticipated pre-study validation cut 
point factor for RA patients. A further assay that allowed to recover part of the sensitivity was designed 
and a number of samples were tested.   
The CHMP concluded that the use of this more sensitive method for the analysis of the samples would not 
significantly impact the overall comparability exercise between FKB327 and Humira. 
Pivotal phase I PK study FKB327-001 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety and PK of FKB327 and EU-approved and 
US-licensed Humira after single doses, by sc injection in healthy subjects. The secondary objective was to 
assess immunogenicity and tolerability after single doses of FKB327 and EU-approved and US-licensed 
Humira, by sc injection.  
The study was performed at one centre in UK  which has been subject to GCP inspections carried out by 
European and US competent authorities and no critical or major finding has been found. The FKB327-001 
study itself has been audited by an ICH GCP audit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

The study FKB327-001 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study performed in healthy male 
subjects and healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential. 
Test and reference products 
•  Reference product 1: EU-approved Humira (adalimumab) 40 mg/0.8 mL as a single subcutaneous 
injection,   
•  Reference  product  2:  US-approved  Humira  (adalimumab)  40  mg/0.8  mL  as  a  single 
subcutaneous injection.  
• 
Test product: Adalimumab 40 mg as a subcutaneous injection. 
In total, 180 subjects were enrolled in the study across 3 treatment groups: 60 subjects in each of the 
FKB327, EU-Humira and US-Humira treatment groups, respectively. Consenting male and female healthy 
volunteers aged 18 to 65 years with a weight 60 to 90 kg and body mass index 18 to 30 kg/m2 were 
enrolled.  
Blood samples for serum drug concentration measurements and ADA titre were collected until 1536 hours 
(64 days) after dosing (0, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 360, 528, 696, 864, 1032, 1200 
and 1536h).  
Considering the long half-life of approximately 14 days, the duration of 64 days is judged appropriate to 
evaluate the elimination phase of adalimumab and the anti-drug antibodies. PK sampling time points are 
considered appropriate for comparison of absorption and elimination period. The last sampling time is at 
1536 hours post-dose which corresponds to 4.57 half-lives. The sampling schedule covers the plasma 
concentration time curve long enough to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure which is 
achieved as AUC(0-t) covers at least 80% of AUC(0-∞). 
Maximum  concentrations  of  adalimumab  were  attained  (tmax)  at  approximately  144  hours  post-dose 
(median  estimates)  following  single  SC  administration  of  FKB327  and  US-licensed  Humira,  with  tmax 
attained slightly later for EU-approved Humira at 192 hours post dose. Thereafter, serum concentrations 
declined  with  geometric  mean  elimination  half-life  (t1/2)  of  324,  345  and  366  hours  for  FKB327, 
EU-approved and US-licensed Humira, respectively.

Treatment: PK Analysis Set 
Table 3 Study FKB327-001: Summary of Equivalence Analysis (ANCOVA) (PK Analysis Set) 
Based on the original ANCOVA analysis, bioequivalence between Hulio and Humira was demonstrated 
since the ratios (90% CI) of geometric means for both primary PK endpoints AUC0-last and Cmax was 
within the acceptability range of 80-125% in the study. However, some limitations were identified with 
this ANCOVA approach namely that the choice of covariates to include in the ANCOVA model was data 
driven.  
As expected, the 90% CIs produced by the ANOVAs were wider than those produced by the ANCOVA and 
as  a  result  for  the  FKB327/EU-approved  Humira  comparison,  the  primary  endpoint  Cmax  and  the 
secondary endpoint AUC0-360h had upper 90% CIs (1.29 for both) outside the bioequivalence criteria of

0.80 to 1.25. In this ANOVA analysis of FKB327-001, serum drug concentration was not adjusted for the 
protein content in each study drug. No such adjustments were pre-planned in the protocol and SAP. 
Table 4 Summary of Equivalence Analysis (ANOVA Assuming Equal Variance) (PK Analysis 
Set) 
At the request of CHMP, the ANCOVA analyses has been repeated by the applicant forcing all pre-specified 
covariates  (age,  body  weight,  body  surface  area,  and  sex)  into  the  model.  After  repetition,  the  90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) around the ratio of geometric least squares means (LSMs) were still within the 
pre-specified  limits  of  0.80  to  1.25  for  all  treatment  comparisons  for  the  primary  PK  endpoints  and 
bioequivalence was concluded between all 3 treatments. The 90% CIs  for the  ratios of the secondary 
endpoint AUC0-360h were also within pre-specified limits for all three comparisons, as was the 90% CI for 
t1/2  in  the  FKB327/EU-Humira  comparison.  The  lower  90%  CI  for  t1/2  in  the  FKB327/US-Humira  and 
EU-Humira/US-Humira  comparisons  fell  slightly  below  the  pre-specified  limit  at  0.77  and  0.79, 
respectively.

ADA formation 
ADA  formation  against  adalimumab  is  known  to  be  accompanied  by  increased  clearance  and  reduced 
exposure, as well as possible loss of efficacy. The impact of ADA levels on PK parameters for FKB327 was 
compared to US-licensed Humira and EU-approved Humira in healthy volunteers in study FKB327-001. 
However,  due  to  the  uncertainties  related  to  the  numerous  inconclusive  samples  in  the  assays,  no 
conclusion can be drawn on the comparability of the immunogenicity profiles of FKB327 and EU-Humira 
and US-Humira for the healthy subjects included in the study FKB327-001. Because the deficient ADA and 
NAb assays were only used in the study FKB327-001 and because  ADA or NAb are  not included as a 
covariate of  the  ANCOVA  model  used  to  conclude  the  bioequivalence  between  all  3  treatments  in  the 
study FKB327-001, this issue was not pursued by the CHMP. 
Study FKB327-005 
This  study  is  a  Phase  I,  randomised,  open-label,  parallel,  single-dose  study  to  assess  the  relative 
bioavailability of a subcutaneous dose of FKB327 when administered using a pre-filled syringe, a pre-filled 
auto-injector or a vial with disposable syringe in healthy subjects. 
The primary objective is to assess the relative bioavailability of FKB327 after a single SC dose delivered 
by  vial/syringe  (vial),  PFS  and  AI  in  healthy  subjects.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to  compare the 
safety of FKB327 after a single SC dose delivered by vial, PFS and AI in healthy subjects, to describe the 
effect of body weight on the single SC dose PK of FKB327 in healthy subjects and to describe the effect of 
injection site on the single SC dose PK of FKB327 in healthy subjects.

The  PK  parameters  were  log-transformed  prior  to  analysis  and  were  analysed  using  a  fixed-effects 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The model included treatment as a fixed effect.

A secondary analysis also investigated the effect of adding body weight strata and injection site into the 
above  ANOVA  model  individually  and  in  combination  as  fixed  effects.  In  addition,  due  to  potential 
formation of FKB327 ADAs, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax and t1/2 were analyzed using a fixed-effects ANOVA 
model, with a term for treatment and ADA titer results at the last sampling time point (the result was 
classified as being within the median, lower or upper quartiles), along with an ADA titer by treatment 
interaction term.

PFS/vial, FKB327 AI/vial and FKB327 AI/PFS 
The PFS was bioequivalent to the vial in terms of all primary PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax), 
as  the  90%  CIs  around  the  geometric  means  ratios  were  fully  contained  within  the  predefined 
bioequivalence (BE) limits of 0.80 to 1.25 using ANOVA. For the AI/vial and AI/PFS comparisons, the 90% 
CIs of the geometric LS means ratios for AUC0-∞ and Cmax were fully contained within the predefined BE 
limits of 0.80 to 1.25, although for both the AI/vial and AI/PFS comparisons, the upper limit of 90% CIs 
of the geometric LS means ratios for AUC0-t was slightly outside the predefined BE limits of 0.80 to 1.25. 
This was not considered as a concern by the CHMP and does not preclude any switch between the three 
presentations.  
With  regard  to  the  injection  site,  the  abdominal  wall  group  showed  a  tendency  for  lower  exposure 
compared to the thigh group. With regard to body weight, the exposure for the 50 to 75 kg group was 
higher than for the >75 to 100 kg group. 
Study FKB327-004 
The objective of the study was to compare PK and the safety of FKB327 and US-sourced Humira after 
single dose, by sc injection in Japanese healthy male subjects. Immunogenicity and local tolerability of 
FKB327 were also investigated.

Table 8 Summary of PK Similarity Analysis using ANOVA: PK Analysis Set 
The applicant was requested to present an  ANCOVA using baseline covariates but  not ADA level. The 
baseline subject characteristics of age, weight and body surface area were chosen for the requested post 
hoc analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of results of study FKB327-004 because these parameters have 
been described as potentially influencing the PK of adalimumab (Humira EPAR). Gender was not relevant 
as  a  covariate  in  this  study  since  all  subjects  were  male.  The  same  primary  and  secondary 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and bioequivalence limits were chosen as used in the pre-specified PK 
analyses for this study. 
The results of ANCOVA including age, weight, body surface area as covariates are shown in the table 
below:

Considering  the  primary  PK  parameters,  the  90%  CIs  of  the  geometric  LS  mean  ratios  for  Cmax  and 
AUC0-360h were fully contained within the pre-specified bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25, but the 
upper 90% CI of the geometric LS mean ratio for AUC0-t was slightly outside the pre-defined range. 
For the secondary PK parameters, the upper limits of 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for both 
AUC0-∞ and t1/2 were outside the range.  
In conclusion, the analyses requested support equivalence of Cmax and AUC0-360h but not of AUC0-t 
and AUC0-∞.  
Study FKB327-002 and 003 
In studies FKB327-002 and -003, a statistical comparison of the Ctrough concentrations pre-dose (PK 
Population) has been carried out. 
Figure 3 Study FKB327-002: Mean (±Standard Deviation) Serum Concentrations of 
Adalimumab by Treatment (PK Analysis Set) 
In study FKB327-002, LSM serum trough concentrations of adalimumab were higher at all time points 
following FKB327 administration compared to Humira. LSM serum trough concentrations of adalimumab 
at Week 24 were slightly higher following FKB327 administration (4126.0 ng/mL) compared to Humira 
(3758.2  ng/mL).  The  ratio  of  geometric  LSM  (90%  CI)  serum  trough  adalimumab  concentrations  for 
FKB327/US-Humira at Weeks 20 and 24 and for the average of Weeks 20 and 24 (ie, after achieving 
steady state) were 1.13 (0.98, 1.30), 1.10 (0.94, 1.27) and 1.11 (0.97, 1.28), respectively, and all of 
these 90% CIs included unity.

Compare Treatment Averaged Across Period I Time-points: PK Analysis Set 
As expected, the differences observed in ADA titres did impact on serum trough concentrations and 
efficacy parameters. ADA formation against adalimumab is known to be accompanied by increased 
clearance and reduced exposure, as well as possible loss of efficacy. However, there was no difference 
between FKB327 and Humira in terms of the effect of ADA titre on PK parameters by drug titre in patients 
with RA. 
Special populations  
Analyses  in  the  special  populations  are  not  relevant  in  the  Hulio  MAA  as  the  biosimilar  relies  on  the 
information already known of the reference product. Renal and hepatic impairment are not expected to 
influence the PK of an antibody and dedicated PK studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
have not been carried out. 
No gender-related differences were observed with the reference product after correction for body-weight. 
According  to  the  Humira  SmPC,  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  with  data  from  over  1,300  RA 
patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 39/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dedicated  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the  elderly  have  not  been  carried  out.  The  amount  of  elderly 
subjects (> 65 years) in the clinical PK studies is very small and the Humira SmPC indicates that after 
adjustment for weight differences, age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. No 
clinical studies have been conducted with Hulio in the paediatric patient population. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No formal interaction studies have been performed with Hulio and no interaction studies are needed in the 
biosimilarity exercise. By analogy to endogenous IgG, adalimumab clearance did not appear to occur by 
excretion  and  liver  metabolism  as  conventional  drugs,  rendering  classical  mechanisms  for 
pharmacokinetic interactions unlikely. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Adalimumab  binds  specifically  to  TNF  and  neutralises  the  biological  function  of  TNF  by  blocking  its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes 
in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM 1, VCAM 1, and ICAM 1 with 
an IC50 of 0.1 0.2 nM). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
After treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C 
reactive  protein  (CRP)  and  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR))  and  serum  cytokines  (IL  6)  was 
observed,  compared  to  baseline  in  patients  with  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Serum  levels  of  matrix 
metalloproteinases  (MMP  1  and  MMP  3)  that  produce  tissue  remodelling  responsible  for  cartilage 
destruction  were  also  decreased  after  adalimumab  administration.  Patients  treated  with  adalimumab 
usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. 
A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
Crohn's  disease,  ulcerative  colitis  and  hidradenitis  suppurativa  after  treatment  with  adalimumab.  In 
patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the 
colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal 
mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
With respect to the clinical pharmacokinetics, the development program to demonstrate the similarity 
between Hulio and Humira is in general adequate and was performed according to the guidance on similar 
biological products and the recommendations given in the CHMP Scientific Advices. The comparability 
exercise was performed between EU/US sourced reference products and the formulation intended to be 
marketed in the European Union.  
The Hulio PK program consists of two pivotal phase I studies carried out in healthy subjects (Clinical 
Studies FKB327-001 and FKB327-005) and the PK data collected in the pivotal phase III study in patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

with RA. In addition, the Applicant conducted a supportive Phase 1 study in Japan comparing the PK of 
FKB327 and US-licensed Humira to enable a local product licence application (Study FKB327-004).  
In general, the assay format employed by the applicant for the measurement of adalimumab is 
considered acceptable. See below discussion on the ADA and Nab assays used in the study FKB327-001. 
The use of a parallel design in Study FKB327-001 to demonstrate bioequivalence of Hulio and Humira 
primarily  is  considered  appropriate  by  the  CHMP  for  a  monoclonal  antibody  with  per  definition  a  long 
half-life  and  a  potential  of  immunogenicity.  The  population  enrolled  in  this  study  is  adequate  since 
volunteers are the most sensitive population for initial and comparative investigation of PK.  
Based on the data submitted in the initial application, biosimilarity of Hulio to Humira was not considered 
established because of uncertainties with respect to the PK data. In addition, discrepancies were seen 
between the N-glycan patterns of Hulio and EU-approved Humira, including differences in high mannose 
content, a quality attribute which was formerly reported to affect pharmacokinetic properties.  
At the CHMP request, the applicant has therefore provided the reanalysis of the pivotal PK trial by 
ANCOVA forcing all pre-specified covariates into the model. The introduction of covariates in the statistical 
analysis (ANCOVA) helped to reduce the variability introduced by using different patients (with possibly 
different baseline characteristics) on each treatment arm and was used instead of ANOVA. Even if this 
method is not the standard approach to be used in bioequivalence testing and is not included in the EMA 
rules for bioequivalence (due to crossover design being the standard design for small molecules), 
ANCOVA was pre-specified in the SAP and is deemed justified by the CHMP for a parallel design of a 
monoclonal antibody with the aim to reduce variability and to increase precision. Using ANCOVA, the 90% 
CIs around the ratio of geometric LSMs are well within the pre-specified bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 
1.25 for all treatment comparisons for the primary PK endpoints, thus PK similarity was concluded 
between all 3 treatments (FKB327, EU-Humira and US-Humira).  
At the CHMP request, the applicant has also further investigated the potential reasons for the observed PK 
differences discussing all the attributes known to have an impact on the PKs of mAbs (drug presentations, 
ethnic factors...). A special attention has been paid to the physicochemical and functional characteristics 
of FKB327 (glycan patterns, LMWS) and evidence has been provided that the relative difference in high 
mannose content (and/or other physicochemical/biological parameters) between test and reference 
products has negligible impact on pharmacokinetics.  
With regard to the ADA and Nab assays used in the study FKB327-001, no conclusion can be drawn on the 
comparability of the immunogenicity profiles of FKB327 and EU-Humira and US-Humira for the healthy 
subjects included in this study due to the uncertainties related to the numerous inconclusive samples in 
the assays. However, because the deficient ADA and NAb assays were only used in the study FKB327-001 
and because ADA or NAb  are not included as a covariate of the ANCOVA model used to conclude the 
bioequivalence between all 3 treatments in the study FKB327-001, this issue was not pursued by the 
CHMP.  
Supportive PK data from healthy volunteers are also provided with the results of a PK trial (FKB327-004) 
comparing FKB327 to US-Humira in Japanese subjects. The PK trial FKB327-005 comparing three modes 
of delivery of FKB327 from a vial, a PFS and an AI has also been carried out in healthy subjects. These 
trials used the same design as the pivotal trial.  
Overall,  the  three  presentations  are  considered  equivalent  for  their  intended  clinical  use  in  study 
FKB327-005.  
The conclusion from study FKB327-004 is that equivalence has not been demonstrated for some 
important PK parameters. Indeed, the results of the requested ANCOVA analysis using baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 41/141 
 
 
 
 
 
covariates but not ADA level support equivalence of Cmax and AUC0-360h but not of AUC0-t and AUC0-
∞ and are consistent with the ANOVA analysis previously presented. It should be noted that there is a 
substantial difference between study FKB327-001 and study FKB327-004 in demographic characteristics 
like mean body weight/BMI and race. The applicant points out a previous (pre-specified) analysis 
adjusting for ADA titre where the criteria for bioequivalence where met on all 3 primary parameters. 
However, this analysis cannot be considered reliable as the ADA titre may depend on the treatment taken. 
Indeed, the trend for slightly higher ADA titres with US-Humira could explain the slight difference in the 
tail of the exposure profile. In addition, the frequency of ADA occurrence cannot be compared directly 
since different ADA assays were used and the covariates used in study FKB327-001 were demographic 
while that used in study FKB327-004 was post-dose ADA titre. However, these data are only provided for 
completeness sake as this is a comparison of Hulio with US Humira, which is not directly relevant to this 
application. 
According to literature, there are no significant differences in the PK characteristics in healthy subjects 
and RA patients. However, in the total comparability exercise, supportive PK data from clinical studies in 
patients are encouraged and could provide highly supportive evidence of a similarity. Target-mediated 
clearance can only be really investigated in patients. However, with the high variability linked to disease 
and to therapy, no reasonable bioequivalence approach can be proposed for a parallel group design in 
phase III trials in patients. In order to obtain valid data, high patient numbers would be required which is 
not feasible within a phase III trial and multiple sampling required for an adequate PK assessment of the 
test and reference product. Bearing in mind the complexity of performing a PK profile in patients in phase 
III, it is not realistic to establish pre-defined rules for bioequivalence on the basis of the limited blood 
sampling opportunities and number of patients in each treatment group. The phase I studies in healthy 
male subjects are used as the major studies for establishing bioequivalence. 
Nevertheless, a statistical comparison for the Ctrough pre-dose concentrations in the target population 
(at weeks 4, 12, 20 and 24 and at weeks 12, 24 and 30 in the phase III studies FKB327-002 and 003 
respectively) has been carried out by the applicant. The small differences in mean trough serum drug 
concentrations observed in the clinical studies are not expected to result in clinically meaningful 
differences in efficacy and safety. 
As expected, the differences observed in ADA titres did impact on serum trough concentrations and 
efficacy parameters. ADA formation against adalimumab is known to be accompanied by increased 
clearance and reduced exposure, as well as possible loss of efficacy. However, there was no difference 
between FKB327 and Humira in terms of the effect of ADA titre on PK parameters by drug titre in patients 
with RA. 
Analyses in the special populations are not relevant in the Hulio MAA as the biosimilar relies on the 
information already known of the reference product. No formal drug-drug interaction studies are 
considered needed by the CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Typically, the comparability of the pharmacokinetic parameters is analysed using ANOVA, which is 
adequate for the analysis of a cross-over trial. However, for a parallel group study it may be desirable to 
adjust for baseline characteristics that could affect the PK results and which may be imbalanced between 
the two treatment arms. Therefore, analysis of comparability of the pharmacokinetic parameters by 
ANCOVA are acceptable in parallel group studies, provided that the choice of covariates is justified and 
provided that this is pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan. This is the case for study FKB327-001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 42/141 
 
 
 
 
 
From a PK perspective, using an updated ANCOVA model, the 90% CIs around the ratio of geometric LSMs 
are well within the pre-specified bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for all treatment comparisons for the 
primary PK endpoints, thus PK similarity was concluded between all 3 treatments (FKB327, EU-Humira 
and US-Humira). 
In conclusion, the applicant has provided adequate bridging data between Humira-US and Humira-EU. 
The Phase 1 FKB327-001 study provide a three-way comparison of FKB327 and both EU- and US-licenced 
Humira and the results demonstrate similarity between EU- and US-licenced Humira and the latter 
formulations are considered as equivalent. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Two studies were performed to assess equivalence of Hulio with Humira in RA patients. A 24 week phase 
3  trial  (FKB327-002)  was  performed  to  assess  efficacy  and  safety  characteristics  of  both  products. 
Patients  that  finished  this  study  were  invited  to  enter  a  long  term  80  week  follow  up  study  after 
re-randomisation (FKB327-003).  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were undertaken. Given that FKB327-002 was intended to prove similarity 
between products at equal doses and treatment schedules the lack of dose response studies is not an 
issue for the CHMP as the same scheduling routine that is used for Humira was implemented. 
2.5.2.  Main study

Treatments 
Patients received either FKB327 40 mg eow or US-licensed Humira 40 mg eow by sc injection for up to 22 
weeks. 
FKB327 was manufactured by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan and the vial presentation was provided 
by the Sponsor. US-licensed Humira PFSs were provided by the Sponsor. 
FKB327 was supplied as a vial containing a clear, colourless, and preservative-free solution for sc 
administration. Each sterile vial was filled with 0.8 mL deliverable volume of 50 mg/mL FKB327 
formulated in monosodium glutamate, sorbitol, methionine, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid and water 
for injection at pH 5.2. Each vial was for single use only.

In each kit a disposable masking unit was provided by the Sponsor for the blinded administration of every 
dose of FKB327 or Humira. 
Prior Concomitant Therapy 
Permitted Concomitant Medication 
Patients were to have taken MTX (oral or parenteral) for at least 3 months and at a stable dose of 10 to 
25 mg/week for the last 8 weeks immediately prior to Screening. Patients were to continue to take this 
stable dose during the study. The route of administration of MTX was not to change throughout the study. 
The patient’s MTX dose could be reduced for toxicity only. If toxicity occurred, this was to be recorded as 
an AE. Patients were also to have taken folic/folinic acid at a dose of at least 5 mg/week during the study. 
Folic/folinic  acid  could  be  started  at  Screening  if  the  patient  was  not  already  receiving  it.  Oral 
corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) were permitted during the study if the dose had 
been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and the same dose was continued during the study. An 
increase  in  oral  steroid  dose  was  permitted  to  treat  concomitant  conditions,  e.g.,  asthma,  only.  The 
reason for any such increase in dose was to be recorded as an AE (e.g., asthma flare). The dose was to 
be tapered back down as soon as medically viable and within 2 weeks. 
NSAIDs up to the maximum approved dose were permitted during the study if the dose had been stable 
for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and during the study. Patients were to continue to take this stable 
dose during the study. The NSAID dose could be increased (not above the maximum approved dose) for 
up to 2 weeks to treat an RA flare. This was to be documented as a change in the concomitant medication. 
The dose was to be tapered back down as soon as medically viable and within 2 weeks. Patients who were 
not receiving NSAIDs could be treated with an NSAID for up to 2 weeks or an additional NSAID could be 
added to an existing NSAID regimen for up to 2 weeks to treat an RA flare. 
Analgesics up to the maximum approved dose were permitted during the study but were not to be taken 
in the 24 hours prior to efficacy evaluations. 
Patients  with  evidence  or  suspicion  of  latent  TB  at  Screening,  could  be  enrolled  providing  that  they 
commenced prophylactic anti-mycobacterial treatment at least 3 weeks prior to randomisation (or longer, 
if local guidelines specified) and committed to completing the course of treatment. The treatment was to 
be according to local guidelines. If needed, such patients could be re-screened. 
All concomitant medications (including over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, preventative 
vaccines,  vitamins and food supplements) and procedures were to be recorded in the electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). Concomitant medications for chronic conditions were to be kept stable throughout 
the study wherever possible. 
Prohibited Concomitant Medication 
Immunisation with a live or attenuated vaccine was prohibited within 4 weeks prior to study dosing, for 
the duration of study, and for 3 months after administration of the last dose. 
Treatment with an investigational agent within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug prior to Screening, 
whichever was longer, was prohibited. 
Treatment with intra-articular and parenteral steroids within 28 days prior to study dosing or during the 
study was prohibited. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 46/141 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with other DMARDs (apart from MTX) was prohibited for the duration of the study. In the event 
the Investigator wished to treat a patient with a DMARD (other than MTX) during the study, the patient 
was to be withdrawn from study treatment and the reason for withdrawal documented. 
Treatment with an agent which might confound efficacy or safety evaluation in this study (e.g., RANKL 
inhibitors for osteoporosis, immunomodulators for asthma) was prohibited within 5 half-lives of the drug 
concerned prior to the first dose of study treatment or during the study period. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  FKB327  compared  with  Humira,  when  each  was 
administered in combination with MTX. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the safety profiles of FKB327 and Humira, each in combination with MTX treatment. 
To assess the efficacy profiles of FKB327 and Humira over time, including initial onset of effect. 
To  compare  the  proportions  of  patients  on  FKB327  and  Humira,  who  developed  ADAs  and  to 
summarise the distribution of the level of ADA activity between patients on FKB327 and Humira. 
To  compare  the  steady-state  PK  of  FKB327  and  Humira  administered  by  multiple  dosing  in 
patients with RA receiving concomitant treatment with MTX. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
ACR20 response rate at Week 24. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is as follows: 
•  DAS28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) score at Week 24. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
•  ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates over time. 
Values of the individual ACR core set variables (swollen joint count, tender joint count, CRP, patient‟s 
assessment of disease activity, physician’s assessment of disease activity, patient‟s assessment of pain, 
HAQ-DI) over time. 
•  DAS28-CRP score and change in DAS28-CRP score over time. 
•  DAS28 score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at Weeks 12 and 24. 
Other Endpoints 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients developing ADAs. 
Trough adalimumab concentration.

Safety Endpoints 
•  Safety  as  assessed  by  AEs,  SAEs,  serious  infections,  malignancies,  vital  signs,  and  laboratory 
abnormalities. 
Sample size 
A total of 680 patients were to be randomised to FKB327 and Humira treatment in a 1:1 allocation ratio. 
This sample size has been calculated based on being able to show equivalence of the ACR20 response rate 
in  FKB327  and  Humira,  with  80%  power  and  an  equivalence  margin  of  ±13%,  an  estimated  ACR20 
response rate of 57% to 63% and a maximum of 15% of patients ineligible for the PPAS. In order for 
biosimilarity to be demonstrated using these criteria, the two-sided 95% CI of the difference in ACR20 
response rate between the 2 treatment groups must lie entirely within the bounds of -13% to +13%. With 
this sample size, the asymmetric equivalence margin of -12% to +15% using the 90% CI would provide 
approximately 88% power in being able to show equivalence between FKB327 and Humira. 
Randomisation 
Patients were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FKB327 40 mg eow or Humira 40 mg eow 
using the following stratification factors: prior biological treatment for RA (yes/no) and Screening disease 
activity (DAS28-CRP ≤5.1/>5.1). In order to balance treatment allocation as far as possible within strata 
and by site, a dynamic randomisation was used (as defined in the randomisation specification document).  
Blinding (masking) 
A  blinded  kit  containing  a  single  dose  of  either  FKB327  or  Humira  was  supplied  by  the  Sponsor.  The 
person  preparing  the  injection  (pharmacist  or  other  suitably  qualified  member  of  staff  not  otherwise 
involved in the study) was unblinded once the treatment kit was opened. As FKB327 was provided in vials 
and Humira was provided in PFSs, the following measures were taken to ensure the blinding of patients 
and study site staff: 
• 
• 
• 
In the event that the kit contained FKB327, on the day of administration the unblinded pharmacist 
(or other suitably qualified member of staff not otherwise involved in the study) withdrew 0.8 mL 
(40 mg) FKB327 from the vial using the syringe provided in the kit. The filled syringe was then 
placed  into  a  masking  unit  (which  allowed  the  dose  to  be  administered  without  revealing  the 
appearance of the syringe) before being taken to the location of the patient. 
If the kit contained Humira, no assembly was necessary as the Humira PFS was already inserted 
into a masking unit at the investigational medicinal product (IMP) packing facility. 
The masking units for both FKB327 and Humira were identical in external appearance. 
•  A nurse (unblinded) who was not otherwise involved in the study assessments administered the 
injections without allowing the patient to see the syringe before, during or after administration. In 
advance of administering the first dose the nurse explained to the patient how this procedure 
would be conducted. It was essential that the nurse did not inadvertently communicate to the 
patient  which  treatment  they  were  receiving  or  show  them  the  study  treatment  out  of  the 
masking unit.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses sets 
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was  defined  as  the  set  of  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the 
randomised treatment and who had at least 1 evaluable primary efficacy measurement after their first 
dose of randomised treatment and was derived programmatically. The criteria leading to exclusion from 
the FAS were fully defined prior to unblinding the study data. The FAS was used for the primary efficacy 
analysis and other efficacy endpoints and analyses. Patients were analysed according to the randomised 
treatment in the primary analysis. 
The Per-protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) was defined as the set of patients in the FAS that had not deviated 
sufficiently  from  the  protocol  as  to  impact  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  was  derived 
programmatically. The criteria leading to exclusion from the PPAS were fully defined prior to unblinding 
the study data. These criteria were assessed and documented within the Analysis Sets Specification Form, 
which was finalised during a data review meeting prior to database lock. 
The  FAS  and  the  PPAS  were  both  relevant  analysis  sets  for  demonstrating  equivalence  so  both  were 
utilised for the equivalence tests of ACR20 response rate and DAS28-CRP score at Week 24. For other 
efficacy endpoints and analyses, the FAS was used. 
Statistical tests 
The percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response at Week 24 was summarised using percentages 
and their 95% CIs, via the Clopper-Pearson method, by treatment for the FAS and the PPAS. The CIs for 
the differences in treatments (FKB327 – Humira) were calculated using a normal approximation with no 
continuity correction. 
For the FAS analysis, patients without an ACR20 response recorded at Week 24 or those patients who had 
been  withdrawn  from  the  study  or  treatment  had  efficacy  data  imputed  depending  on  reason  for 
missingness.  
The  secondary  hypothesis  involved  equivalence  of  the  difference  between  FKB327  and  Humira  in 
DAS28-CRP at Week 24.  The LSM for week  × treatment group from the marginal model for repeated 
measures were estimated with 95% CIs and the difference in LSMs of FKB327-Humira at Week 24 was 
estimated with 95% CI. Baseline DAS28-CRP, previous biological treatment for RA (yes/no) and site were 
included as covariates. To handle missing DAS28-CRP, a repeated measures analysis model was used. 
This method was consistent with assuming that any missing values were missing at random.

Participant flow 
Figure 4 Patient disposition: all enrolled patients 
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 05 January 2015 and the last patient completed the study on 12 July 
2016.  Patients  were  enrolled  from  109  sites  in  12  countries.  For  the  purposes  of  randomisation,  the 
countries were assigned to 3 geographical regions: North America (US and Canada), Europe (Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Romania and Spain) and Rest of World (Chile, Peru, Russia and the 
Ukraine). Overall, 728 patients were recruited with the proportion of patients recruited in each region 
being similar for the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups.  The most important contribution to patient 
enrolment was from the EU (38%) and Eastern Europe (31%). Four countries recruited the majority of 
patients (63%): Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Peru. 
Conduct of the study 
There were three substantial amendments to the protocol but only two after study initiation. These were 
numerous clarifications, change of sample size and rationale after interaction with regulatory authorities, 
definitions of FAS and PKAS populations. In addition, the exclusion of patients with a history of clinically 
significant contact allergy/hypersensitivity to latex or rubber was added after a potential safety issue 
regarding the handling of Humira was identified as the needle cover on Humira PFS contains dry natural 
rubber.

In total, 89 patients (12%) had at least one ‘major significant’ protocol deviation leading to exclusion from 
the PPAS: 52 patients (14%) and 37 patients (10%) in the FKB327 and Humira treatment arms, 
respectively. The most common ‘major significant’ protocol deviations were: 
•  missed visit (Week 0 or Week 24 visits, affecting primary efficacy endpoint), reported for 24 
patients (6.5%) and 21 patients (5.8%) in the FKB327 and Humira treatment arms, respectively 
• 
violation of efficacy inclusion/exclusion criteria, reported for 10 patients (2.7%) and 7 patients 
(1.9%) in the FKB327 and Humira treatment arms, respectively. 
Although there were slightly more ‘major significant’ protocol deviations for patients in the FKB327 
treatment arm compared to Humira, there was no trend in the type of protocol deviations reported. 
In addition, 129 patients (35%) and 120 patients (33%) in the FKB327 and Humira treatment arms, 
respectively, had at least one ‘major’ protocol deviation, the most common being visit out-of-widow and 
stratification error. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Demographics are summarised in the table below. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect 
to the demographic characteristics. 
Overall, mean age was 53.3 years (range 18 to 93 years) and was well matched in both the FKB327 and 
Humira  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  patients  were  female  (77.6%)  and  White  (85.0%).  Mean 
weight (73.46 kg overall) and height (163.30 cm overall) were also similar in both treatment groups.

Baseline  characteristics  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  Treatment  groups  were  well  matched  for 
most baseline RA characteristics, including those variables in the ACR Core Set and Baseline DAS28. The 
majority of patients were positive (76.4%) for rheumatoid factor, mean serum MMP-3 concentration was 
76.9 ng/mL (range 4 to 753 ng/mL), mean CRP 25.8 mg/L (range 1 to 230 mg/L), mean ESR 40.0 mm/hr 
(range 2 to 110 mm/hr), mean TJC (68 joint count) 26.1 joints (range 0 to 68 joints), mean SJC (66 joint

The rheumatoid factor values are categorised as ‘negative’ if <12 kU/l and ‘positive’ if ≥12 kU/l. 
Prior anti-rheumatic drugs 
Prior anti-rheumatic drugs for RA are summarised in the tables below. Prior anti-rheumatic drugs for RA 
were classified as those used and discontinued at least once prior to Screening in this study. Overall, 
approximately two-thirds of patients had received at least 1 DMARD for RA prior to study entry and the 
FKB327 and Humira treatment groups were well matched with respect to prior DMARD use for RA. The 
most commonly used DMARDs were MTX (43.0%), sulfasalazine (16.8%) and leflunomide (16.6%). It 
should be noted that the MTX dose was adjusted prior to study start according to the protocol and patients 
were required to be on a stable dose for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to Screening. 
Fewer patients overall had received a prior biologic treatment for RA (18.1%), with a similar proportion of 
patients in the FKB327 (17.8%) and Humira (18.5%) treatment groups having received at least 1 prior 
biologic treatment. The most commonly used biologic treatment was abatacept (4.0%). 
Only 6.7% of patients overall had received a prior anti-TNF treatment for RA, with a similar proportion of 
patients  in  the  FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  having  received  1  prior  anti-TNF.  The  most 
commonly used anti-TNF was etanercept (2.7%). 
Per protocol, none had previously received adalimumab.

Concomitant Medication for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
Concomitant oral steroids and NSAIDs and concomitant MTX are summarised in the table below. Again, 
the  FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  concomitant,  stable, 
background treatment for RA. The average concomitant MTX dose was 15.8 mg/week in both treatment 
groups  (range  4.26  to  25.00  mg/week)  with  the  majority  of  patients  receiving  their  MTX  dose  orally. 
Overall, 442 patients (60.7%) were receiving at least 1 concomitant oral steroid for RA during the study, 
424  patients  (58.2%)  were  receiving  at  least  1  concomitant  NSAID  for  RA  during  the  study  and  286 
patients (39.3%) were receiving both concomitant oral steroids and NSAIDs during the study.

Concomitant oral steroids for RA are summarised in the table below. A similar proportion of patients in the 
FKB327 and Humira treatment groups was receiving concomitant oral steroids for RA. The most common 
concomitant  oral  steroids  for  RA  were  methylprednisolone  and  prednisone  and  were  taken  by  similar 
proportions of patients in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups. 
More patients in Europe (58.8%) and the Rest of World (69.5%) received concomitant oral steroids for RA 
compared  to  patients  in  North  America  (29.4%).  The  most  common  concomitant  oral  steroid  used  in 
Europe  was  methylprednisolone  whereas  the  most  common  concomitant  oral  steroid  used  in  North 
America and the Rest of World was prednisone. The average concomitant prednisone equivalent dose was 
46.62  mg/week  overall  (range:  2.0  to  140.0  mg/week)  and  was  similar  in  the  FKB327  and  Humira 
treatment groups.

concomitant NSAIDs for RA were meloxicam and diclofenac, which were taken by a similar proportion of 
patients in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups. 
As  with  concomitant  oral  steroids,  more  patients  in  Europe  (58.1%)  and  the  Rest  of  World  (64.0%) 
received concomitant NSAIDs for RA compared to patients in North America (34.1%). The most common 
concomitant NSAIDs used in Europe and North America was meloxicam and in the Rest of World were 
meloxicam and celecoxib.

Numbers analysed 
Analysis sets are summarised in the table below. Overall, 1 patient (0.3%) in each of the FKB327 and 
Humira treatment groups was excluded from the Safety Analysis Set because they did not receive a dose 
of study drug. 
In total, 9 patients (1.2%) were excluded from the FAS, either because they did not receive study drug or 
because they did not have a primary efficacy measurement after the first study drug dose). Overall, 91 
patients (12.5%) were excluded from the PPAS, with the main reasons for exclusion being missed visit, 
missed/invalid  efficacy  procedure  and  violation  of  efficacy  inclusion/exclusion  criterion  (classified  in  a 
blinded fashion as a ‘major significant’ protocol deviation). In total, 8 patients (1.1%) were excluded from 
the  PKAS  because  they  did  not  receive  a  dose  of  study  drug  or  did  not  have  a  serum  adalimumab 
concentration measurement after dosing.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy evaluation  
The ACR20 response rate at Week 24 is summarised in the table below. For the root cause imputation 
(FAS), as the 95% CI was within the pre-defined limits of ±13% (CHMP), equivalence was concluded 
between FKB327 and Humira. In total, 270 patients (74.4%) in the FKB327 treatment group achieved an 
ACR20 response at Week 24, compared to 271 patients (75.7%) in the Humira treatment group. The 95% 
CI  for FKB327-Humira was -7.6, 5.0. Equivalence  for ACR20 was also indicated between FKB327 and 
Humira for the non-responder imputation (FAS), where the 90% CI was contained within the pre-defined 
limits of -12% and 15% (FDA). For this analysis, 263 patients (72.5%) in the FKB327 treatment group 
achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 compared to 266 patients (74.3%) in the Humira treatment 
group. The 90% CI for FKB327-Humira was -7.3, 3.6. For the PPAS, the CI for FKB327-Humira was also 
contained within the pre-defined limits. Overall, efficacy equivalence was demonstrated.  
The results from the sensitivity analysis of the ACR20 response rate using a mixture of non-responder 
imputation  and  multiple  imputation  support  the  conclusions  from  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  The 
ACR20 response rate for FKB327 and Humira was 75.7% (95% CI: 71.1, 80.3) and 78.4% (95%CI: 74.0, 
82.7), respectively. The estimated FKB327-Humira difference was -2.6%, where the 90% CI (-7.9, 2.6) 
was  contained  within  the  pre-defined  limits  of  -12%  and  15%  (FDA)  and  the  95%CI  (-9.0,  3.7)  was 
contained within the pre-defined limits of ±13% (CHMP). 
The results from tipping-point analysis of the ACR20 response rate in the FAS using both root cause and 
non-responder imputations indicate that even severe deviations from the missing at random assumption 
underlying the sensitivity analysis described in the previous paragraph do not lead to a change in the 
interpretation  of  the  results.  In  fact,  even  shifting  all  imputed  responders  to  non-responders  in  the 
FKB327 treatment group and leaving the imputed values untouched in the Humira group (i.e., shift values 
of 1.0 and 0.0 for FKB327 and Humira, respectively) leads to an estimated FKB327-Humira difference of 
-6.18%, where the 90%CI (-11.52,  -0.83) was contained within pre-defined limits of -12% and 15% 
(FDA)  and  95%CI  (-12.54,  0.19)  was  contained  with  the  pre-defined  limits  of  ±13%  (CHMP).  These 
findings  provide  further  robustness  to  the  primary  analysis  results  and  point  to  the  conclusion  for 
equivalence between FKB327 and Humira.

a Missing responses for the ACR and responses for patients who discontinued the treatment prior to Week 24 were 
imputed  as  follows:  if  the  patient  withdrew  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  withdrawal  of  consent,  an  adverse  event 
(non-infection), medical reason (non-infection) or if the patient had taken a prohibited treatment for RA and had been 
withdrawn from study treatment, they were regarded as ‘non-responders’; for all other patients with a missing ACR 
response  at  Week  24,  last  observation  carried  forward  was  used  on  the  ACR  to  determine  whether  they  were 
‘responders’ or ‘non-responders’.

Disease Activity Score (DAS)28-C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 
The DAS 28-CRP LSM and LSM change from baseline is summarised for the FAS in the figures below. For 
both the FAS and PPAS, the LSM DAS28-CRP were  similar in both the FKB327 and Humira treatment 
groups at all visits and the 95% CI for the difference at Week 24 was within the pre-defined limits of -0.6 
to +0.6 confirming equivalence. For the FAS, at Week 24, the LSM was 3.43 and 3.42 for the FKB327 and 
Humira treatment groups, respectively, and the 95% CI for FKB327-Humira  was -0.17, 0.18. For the

ACR20 response rate 
The ACR20 response rate by time is presented in the figure below. The proportion of patients considered 
to  be  responders  was  similar  in  the  FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  at  all  visits  from  Week  4 
onwards. Prior to Week 4, the number of responders in the FKB327 treatment group was slightly higher 
(37.3%) than in the Humira group (31.0%). By Week 24, the proportion of responders had increased in 
both treatment groups (77.1% and 79.3% in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups, respectively).

3 out of 5 other indicators. Response rate calculated based on patients with an evaluable ACR20 at each 
given visit. 
The ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was also analysed for the following sub-groups used as stratification 
factors: Prior Biologic Treatment for RA (yes/no), Screening DAS28-CRP (≤5.1/>5.1) and Geographical 
Region  (North  America/Europe/Rest  of  World).  The  subgroup  analysis  within  use  of  prior  biologics 
(yes/no), Screening DAS28-CRP and geographical region provided no evidence of heterogeneity of strata 
in terms of differential ACR20 response between the treatment groups. 
ACR50 response rate 
The ACR50 response rate is defined as a 50% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and at least 
3 out of 5 other indicators.Response rate calculated based on patients with an evaluable ACR50 at each 
given visit. 
The ACR50 response rate is presented in the figure below. The proportion of responders was similar in the 
FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  at  all  visits.  By  Week  24,  49.0%  of  patients  in  the  FKB327 
treatment group and 49.4% of patients in the Humira treatment group were responders.

C-reactive protein (CRP) 
CRP values are summarised in the figure below. Mean (SD) CRP values were similar in both the FKB327 
and  Humira  treatment  groups  at  all  time  points  and  the  mean  (SD)  changes  from  baseline  were 
comparable between the treatment groups. The mean (SD) change from Baseline at Week 24 was -14.62

(26.540) and -14.34 (25.733) for the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups, respectively. CRP results 
fluctuated more than the results for the other efficacy parameters. This is to be expected given that CRP 
is a non-specific measure of inflammation and could be affected by concurrent medical conditions such as 
infections.

Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) 
HAQ-DI is summarised in the figure below. The mean (SD) values for the HAQ-DI decreased in both the 
FKB327 and Humira treatment groups throughout the study, with the largest decreases seen at Week 24 
for both groups. The decreases in mean (SD) values were similar for both treatment groups at all time 
points. The mean (SD) change from Baseline at Week 24 was -0.55 (0.615) and -0.53 (0.594) for the 
FKB327 and Humira treatment groups, respectively. It should be noted that larger decreases in mean 
(SD)  values  were  observed  in  the  FKB327  treatment  group  to  Week  8  compared  with  the  Humira 
treatment group.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were undertaken in special or subpopulations 
Supportive study 
Study  FKB327-003  was  an  Open-label  Extension  Study  to  Compare  the  Long  term  Efficacy,  Safety, 
Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics of FKB327 and Humira in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 
Concomitant Methotrexate (ARABESC-OLE). It included RA patients that completed all 24 weeks of study 
procedures (including dosing) according to protocol FKB327-002, with a minimum of 9 doses of study 
drug received, and were continuing with stable concomitant MTX and folate, and in the investigator’s 
opinion, had shown a clinical response to treatment during Study FKB327-002. 
Patients received either FKB327 40 mg eow or Humira 40 mg eow from Week 0 to Week 28 (Period I) in 
an open fashion using PFS presentations of both FKB327 and Humira. From Week 30 onwards (Period II), 
all patients received FKB327 40 mg eow.  
The study was designed to assess long term safety and efficacy of both adalimumab presentations up to 
1 year of treatment (period I), including patients who switched formulations. Final efficacy data from 
period I are presented in the present application and support the long term efficacy of FKB327. 
Maintenance of efficacy, based on ACR20 RR, ACR50 RR and ACR70 RR, was demonstrated for patients on 
continuous FKB327 or Humira treatment. Similar observations were done for the DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI 
endpoints. 
Maintenance of efficacy, based on ACR20 RR, ACR50 RR and ACR70 RR, was demonstrated in the patient 
groups  that  switched  between  adalimumab  presentations.  Similar  observations  were  done  for  the 
DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI endpoints. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Main equivalence study FKB327-002 
Study  FKB327-002  served  to  demonstrate  equivalence  between  two  adalimumab  presentations,  i.e. 
FKB327  and  US-sourced  Humira.  This  study  was  a  phase  3  randomised,  double  blinded,  parallel  arm 
active-controlled study to compare FKB327 efficacy and safety with the comparator Humira in rheumatoid 
arthritis  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  methotrexate,  during  which  FKB327  or  Humira  was 
administered  by  multiple  dosing  every  other  week  for  22  weeks  in  patients  with  active  RA  who  were 
already taking MTX at a stable dose (10 to 25 mg/week) for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to screening but 
who required additional therapy to control their disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 68/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trial was conducted in 12 countries. The most important contribution to patient enrolment was from 
the EU (38%) and Eastern Europe (31%), the rest of the world including North America, Peru and Chile. 
Four  countries  recruited  the  majority  of  patients  (63%):  Poland,  Ukraine,  Russia  and  Peru.  Provided 
similar results are shown across geographical regions, this is acceptable in the context of a biosimilar 
application. 
The CHMP had no concern about the amendments to the study protocol. Deviations were slightly more 
frequent (2-4%) in all categories (without specific pattern) in the FKB327 arm than in the Humira arm but 
this is not considered to have significant impact on the results. 
The applicant requested scientific advice on its phase III clinical programme with both the CHMP and the 
FDA and has implemented the recommendations received from both agencies in its study programme.  
The choice of the indication (rheumatoid arthritis) is in line with the CHMP guidance on similar biological 
products  and  was  endorsed  in  CHMP  Scientific  Advice.  Indeed,  this  clinical  model  was  considered 
sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of differences between the two products. 
The  RA  population  selected  is  considered  appropriate  for  equivalence  investigation  purposes  of 
adalimumab presentations (biosimilars). 
Patients that had been previously treated with adalimumab were excluded from the study. The proposed 
blinding approach was considered adequate by the CHMP.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  the  study  is  the  ACR20  response  rate  at  week  24,  and  the  main 
secondary  endpoint  is  DAS28-CRP  at  week  24  of  treatment,  as  favoured  by  the  CHMP.  The  +/-  13% 
equivalence range on the PE was agreed upon by the CHMP (FDA preferred -12%/+15%), as was the +/- 
0.6 equivalence range for the DAS28-CRP endpoint. In addition, analyses of the PE were performed on the 
FAS with different handling of missing data (both RCI and NRI) and on the PPAS, and were supplemented 
with a sensitivity analysis and a tipping point analysis.  
Considering the results from study FKB327-001, the CHMP acknowledged that FKB327 is highly similar to 
both  EU-Humira  and  US-Humira  in  physicochemical  and  biological  properties.  Hence,  a  single  pivotal 
equivalence trial comparing the test and US-sourced reference product is considered adequate to support 
this biosimilar application. 
Open label extension study FKB327-003 
An extension trial was performed with re-randomisation in each treatment arm for an additional 28 weeks 
of treatment with either product, before all patients were switched to FKB327 for an additional 48 weeks 
of treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Main equivalence study FKB327-002 
Treatment groups were well balanced for demographics and most baseline RA characteristics, and prior 
use of anti-rheumatic drugs. Only 6.7% had received prior anti-TNF therapy for RA, equally distributed 
over both treatment groups, and none had received prior adalimumab. Concomitant RA medications 
remained stable and comparable throughout the study. Overall, 728 patients were randomised with 366 
patients being treated with FKB327 and 362 with US-Humira. About 10% of patients discontinued 
Assessment report

treatment with the most frequent reasons being withdrawal of consent and occurrence of adverse events 
(about 3-4% each) in both treatment arms.  
The PE ACR20 RR difference CI at week 24 was within the predefined +/- 13% equivalence range, both in 
the FAS (RCI for missing data) and PPAS: -1.3 (95% CI -7.6,5.0) and -0.4 (95% CI -6.7,5.9), 
respectively.  
Similarly, the difference in DAS28-CRP values CI was within the predefined equivalence margins both in 
the FAS and the PPAS populations: 0.01 (95% CI -0.17,0.18) and -0.03 (95% CI -0.21,0.15), 
respectively, which was confirmed in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis.  
There were no notable differences between both treatment groups in ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 RR over 
the 24w treatment period.  
Open label extension study FKB327-003 (period I completed data) 
Maintenance of efficacy, based on ACR20 RR, ACR50 RR and ACR70 RR, was demonstrated for patients on 
continuous FKB327 or Humira treatment. Similar observations were done for the DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI 
endpoints. 
Maintenance of efficacy, based on ACR20 RR, ACR50 RR and ACR70 RR, was demonstrated in the patient 
groups that switched between adalimumab presentations. Similar observations were done for the 
DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI endpoints. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Considering the results from study FKB327-001, the CHMP acknowledged that FKB327 is highly similar to 
both  EU-Humira  and  US-Humira  in  physicochemical  and  biological  properties.  Hence,  a  single  pivotal 
equivalence trial comparing the test and US-sourced reference product is considered adequate to support 
this biosimilar application. 
Equivalent efficacy is shown for US-Humira and FKB327 in the selected RA patient population up to one 
year of treatment.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Comparative safety data between FKB327 and Humira were collected in RA patients in the pivotal Phase 
3 studies (FKB327-002 and FKB327-003). Additional supportive safety data are provided from the Phase 
1 studies in healthy subjects (FKB327-001 and FKB327-005).

The Phase 1 study FKB327-001 (40mg, single dose) was meant to allow comparison of safety between 
FKB327  and  Humira,  and  the  healthy 
immunocompetent  subjects  allowed  assessment  of 
immunogenicity. 
The  Phase  1  study  FKB327-005  (40mg,  single  dose)  allowed  comparison  of  tolerability  between  vial, 
prefilled syringe (PFS), and auto-injector (AI) presentations. 
Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients 
In  the  randomized  double-blind  Study  FKB327-002,  safety  versus  US-Humira  was  compared  over  a 
24-week treatment period using the vial presentation. Patients could enter the OLE (Study FKB327-003) 
after  study  ending,  and  were  thus  re-randomized  (2:1  to  continuation  of  treatment  versus  switch  to 
alternate treatment) and switched to PFS presentation. In Period II of the OLE (W30) all were switched to 
FKB327  compound  and  the  majority  received  the  AI  presentation  of  the  study  compound.  The  PFS 
presentation of Humira was used in all clinical studies.

Patient exposure 
Healthy Subjects 
The patient assignment for the PhI FKB327-001 and FKB327-005 are shown in the table below. 
Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients 
Three presentations of FKB327 were used in the clinical program (while only Humira PFS was used): vials 
(FKB327-002), PFS (mainly FKB327-003 Period I) and the auto-injector (AI) (FKB327-003 Period II). In 
Period II, 65 patients in the United States (US) used the FKB327 PFS (pending regulatory approval of the 
AI in that country) whereas the other 507 patients used the FKB327 AI. 
Patient disposition and exposure in Studies FKB327-002 and FKB327-003 are summarized in the figure 
and table below. 
Figure 12 Study FKB327-003: Patient Disposition: All Enrolled Patients 
In  study  FKB327-002,  overall,  more  patients  received  delayed  or  interrupted  dosing  with  FKB327. 
However, this imbalance is due to an imbalance of other reasons attributed to investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) shipment delay issues. There is no major issue for imbalance between FKB327 and Humira 
in study FKB327-002. 
The mean duration of treatment per patient was 163.2 days for FKB327 and 162.1 days for Humira, giving 
a  total  overall  exposure  across  patients of  163.52 patient-years  for  the  FKB327  treatment  group  and

160.63 patient-years for the Humira treatment group. The number of patients dosed at each week was 
similar in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups. 
Table 24 Study FKB327-002: Summary of Exposure to Study Medication (SAS) 
In Study FKB327-003, overall exposure was 673.7 patient-years for FKB327 and 175.4 patient-years for 
Humira. The difference in exposure between the 2 treatments is due to the fact that all patients switched 
to FKB327 for Period II of the study. 
In Study FKB327-003 part II, 507 patients used the FKB327 AI for a mean duration of 317.6 days (range: 
14  to  371  days,  equating  approximately  to  between  1  and  27  doses),  and  overall  exposure  of  440.9 
patient-years.  Duration  of  exposure  across  F-F-F,  F-H-F,  H-F-F  and  H-H-F  groups  was  broadly 
comparable. 
Table 25 Study FKB327-003: Summary of Exposure to Study Medication for Patients using the 
Auto-Injector (Part II): Safety Analysis Set  
The  Safety  Analysis  Set  in  Study  FKB327-002  comprised  366  patients  treated  with  FKB327  and  362 
patients treated with Humira. Of these patients, 216 patients on FKB327 and 213 on Humira proceeded to 
the FF and HH treatment sequences in Study FKB327-003, respectively, and 189 patients on FKB327 and 
190 on Humira completed Period I (1-year data).

For the 1-year safety comparison, the safety profile for 258 patients in the FF sequence (including 216 
patients from FKB327-003 FF and 42 patients who received FKB327 in Study FKB327-002 but did not 
enter Study FKB327-003) has been compared to the safety profile for 254 patients in the HH sequence 
(including 213 patients from FKB327-003 HH and 41 patients who received Humira in Study FKB327-002 
but did not enter Study FKB327-003). 
Table 26 Summary of Patient Disposition during Studies FKB327-002 and FKB327-003 part I: 
All Enrolled Patients 
In the integrated safety analysis, data from the 2 phase 3 studies were pooled (Safety Analysis Set for 
FKB327-002  and  FKB327-003).  Overall  exposure  was  837.26  patient-years  for  FKB327  and  336.01 
patient-years for Humira. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population: 
Phase 1 Studies 
For both studies, demographic characteristics were broadly comparable between treatments. 
Approximately a third of subjects in each treatment group were taking concomitant medications, the most 
common concomitant medications being paracetamol and ibuprofen. 
In Study FKB327-005, there were no clinically significant findings in the medical history.

Table 28 Study FKB327-002: Demographic Characteristics: Safety Analysis Set 
Study FKB327-003: Demographics by Period I treatment were similar for FKB327 and Humira. There was 
a higher proportion of patients aged ≥65 years in the H-H-F treatment sequence (20.7%) and a lower 
proportion in the H-F-F treatment sequence (11.1%); however, this did not greatly impact the mean age, 
which was 54.0 years in the H-H-F sequence compared to between 52.1 and  52.7 years in the other 
sequences.  Overall  mean  age  was  52.9  years  (range  18  to  93  years).  The  majority  of  patients  were 
female (77.7%) and White (85.6%). Mean weight (74.6 kg overall) and height (163.3 cm overall) were 
also similar across the treatment sequences.

Phase 3 study FKB327-002 
The  FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  concomitant,  stable, 
background  treatment  for  RA,  with  the  average  concomitant  MTX  dose  being  15.8  mg/week  in  both 
treatment groups. 
A similar proportion of patients in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups were receiving concomitant 
oral steroids for RA, the most common being methylprednisolone and prednisone. 
A similar proportion of patients in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups were receiving concomitant 
NSAIDs for RA. The most common concomitant NSAIDs for RA were meloxicam and diclofenac. 
Phase 3 study FKB327-003 
Overall, 403 patients (62.5%) were receiving concomitant oral steroids for RA, 394 patients (61.1%) 
were  receiving  concomitant  NSAIDs  for  RA  and  268  (41.6%)  were  receiving  both  NSAIDs  and  oral 
steroids  concomitantly  for  RA.  The  use  of  these  medications  was  not  balanced  across  the  treatment 
sequences and was higher for the F-H-F treatment sequence and lower for the F-F-F treatment sequence 
compared to the other treatment sequences. The mean concomitant MTX dose was 15.9 mg/week (range 
7.50 to 25.00 mg/week) overall, with a higher mean dose of 16.2 mg/week seen in the F-F-F and H-F-F 
treatment  sequences.  The  majority  of  patients  in  each  treatment  sequence  received  their  MTX  dose 
orally.

Table 30 Study FKB327-003: Summary of Concomitant Use of MTX, Oral Steroids and NSAIDs 
for RA by Treatment Sequence: Safety Analysis Set 
Approximately 60% of patients in total received concomitant oral steroids, with no notable differences 
observed across groups; the most common being methylprednisolone and prednisone. More patients in 
Europe (62.0%) and the Rest of World (70.0%) received concomitant oral steroids for RA compared to 
patients in North America (31.6%). 
Approximately  60%  of  patients  in  total  received  NSAIDs;  the  most  common  being  meloxicam  and 
diclofenac. As with concomitant NSAIDs, more patients in Europe (64.5%) and the Rest of World (64.8%) 
received concomitant NSAIDs for RA compared to patients in North America (34.2%). 
Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions 
Phase 3 study FKB327-002 
Overall,  54.1%  of  patients,  at  similar  proportion  between  treatment  groups,  reported  a  past  medical 
history with the most common being related to Surgical and medical procedures. 
Excluding  RA,  the  most  common  concurrent  medical  conditions,  included  menopause,  hypertension, 
osteoporosis,  osteoarthritis,  and  were  reported  for  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  the  FKB327  and 
Humira treatment groups. 
Phase 3 study FKB327-003 
A  total  of  57.5%  of  patients  reported  past  medical  history,  the  most  being  Surgical  and  medical 
procedures and Infections and infestations. No obvious differences could be noted between the different 
treatment schedule subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

As expected, all patients reported having ongoing RA, while other frequently reported concurrent medical 
conditions  included  menopause,  hypertension,  osteoporosis,  and  osteoarthritis.  Fewer  patients  in  the 
F-H-F sequence reported concurrent Infections and infestations, and more patients in the H-H-F sequence 
reported concurrent Endocrine disorders compared to the other sequences. 
Adverse events 
Phase 1 Study FKB327-001 
Overall, 110 subjects (61.1%) experienced at least 1 TEAE, with similar numbers of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs across the treatment groups. There were no deaths and no TEAEs leading to study discontinuation. 
Table 31 Study FKB327-001: Summary of Adverse Events  
The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, 
oropharyngeal pain and injection site hematoma, which were generally reported for similar numbers of 
subjects in each treatment group. 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs, experienced by about half of the  study population, were 
headache,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  oropharyngeal  pain,  nasopharyngitis  and  injection  site 
haematoma. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. 
Phase 1 Study FKB327-005 
A higher proportion in the AI group compared to the vial and PFS groups experienced at least 1 TEAE, 
driven by a greater incidence of nasopharyngitis, injection site rash, vessel puncture site pain and vessel 
puncture site bruising. 
Moderate intensity TEAEs were reported rarely, and no severe TE(S)AEs or discontinuations occurred.

Table 32 Study FKB327-005: Summary of Adverse Events 
The most common TEAEs in all 3 groups were nasopharyngitis and headache, the former occurring in 
higher numbers in the AI group while for the latter this was the opposite. 
TEAEs related to the injection site showed low incidence and included injection site pain, bruising, rash 
and  reaction.  Some  of  these  were  considered  more  related  to  the  administration  device  than  to  the 
product itself. 
A  higher  incidence  of  TEADRs  was  observed  for  the  AI  group,  driven  by  events  that  were  considered 
related to the study drug in the AI group. 
Of note is the fact that very few subjects had TEAEs that were considered device-related, with the related 
TEAEs being identified as injection site bruising and injection site pain.  
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
Overall, TEAE treatment related TEAE incidence is shown in the table below.

Table 33 Study FKB327-002: Summary of Adverse Events: Safety Analysis Set  
In both groups, the most common TEAEs occurred in the SOC Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal 
disorders, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders with similar rate in both groups. 
The most common individual TEAEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection and hypercholesterolaemia. 
Overall, 21.7% of subjects experienced a TEAE related to study drug (3% difference in favour of FKB327), 
the most common ones being injection site erythema, nasopharyngitis and hypercholesterolaemia; all in 
similar proportion for both treatment groups. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 – Period I 
Comparison of the incidence of AEs by treatment sequence H-F, F-H, F-F and H-H allows the evaluation of 
safety of treatment switch. TEAEs incidences in the different treatment combinations are presented in the 
table below. Although the safety profile was slightly better with F-F treatment sequence compared to the 
others, the incidence of severe TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, TESAEs, discontinuations due to TEAEs, 
and treatment interruptions due to TEAEs was generally comparable between treatment sequences (with 
switch or not). There was no outstanding difference between patients who remained on Humira (H-H) 
compared to patients who switched to FKB327 (H-F).

Table  34  Study  FKB327-003:  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  During  Period  I  by  Treatment 
Sequence: Safety Analysis Set  
The most common TEAEs were in the Infections and infestations SOC regardless of treatment sequence: 
20.8% in F-F, 25% in F-H and in H-F, and 29.6% in H-H. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
were also observed frequently (13% in F-F, 13.9% in F-H, 15.7% in H-F, and 7.5% in H-H). There was no 
individual preferred term that appeared notably less frequently in the H-H arm compared with the arms 
receiving FKB327. Minor differences were observed, but, for even for the most common TEAEs, patient 
and event numbers per sequence are too low for these differences to be regarded as clinically relevant in 
the absence of a consistent trend.  
The  Treatment-related  TEAE  (or  TE-ADR)  were  not  presented  by  the  applicant  for  period  I  between 
sequence (F-F and H-H). 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 – Period II and whole study period 
Data are available to allow for an evaluation of the comparative safety for patients who were switched 
from FKB327 in the preceding FKB327-002 double-blind study to Humira in the FKB327-003 OLE study 
(F-H), and then switched back to FKB327 in the second part of the FKB327-003 OLE study (from Week 30; 
double switch F-H-F). 
Discontinuations  due  to  TEAEs,  and  treatment  interruptions  due  to  TEAEs  was  generally  comparable 
between treatment sequences. The proportion of patients experiencing severe TEAEs and TESAEs was 
slightly higher in the F-H-F treatment sequence compared to the remaining treatment sequences.

Table 36 Study FKB327-003: Summary of Adverse Events during the Whole Study Period, by 
Treatment Sequence: Safety Analysis Set  
In period II, the most common TEAEs were for the Infections and infestations SOC and were reported for 
fewer patients who double-switched (F-H-F; 26.0%) compared to the remaining treatment sequences. 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs were for the same SOC. 
Integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies 
The  safety  profiles  of  FKB327  and  Humira,  overall,  are  comparable  with  regards  to  the 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), severe TEAE, treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
TEAE  (TESAE),  treatment-related  TEAE,  and  discontinuation  or  interruption  (due  to  TEAE  or  TESAE). 
However, the incidence was slightly lower with FKB327 compared to Humira for TEAE (2.00 vs. 2.69, 
respectively) and treatment related TEAE (0.56 vs. 0.74). 
There were 5 deaths, of which 4 patients in the FKB327 treatment group and 1 patient in the Humira 
treatment group.

TEAEs were most frequently reported for the SOC Infections and infestations and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders. Overall, the most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (submitted clinical 
safety summary). 
Treatment  related  TEAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  for  the  SOC  Infections  and  infestations 
(submitted  clinical  safety  summary).  The  most  common  treatment  related  TEAEs  were  injection  site 
erythema, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, latent tuberculosis, upper respiratory tract infections, 
bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive, alanine 
aminotransferase  increased,  hypercholesterolaemia,  and  RA  flare.  The  incidence  rates  of  these 
treatment-related TEAEs were broadly comparable between treatments. 
Long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 period I) 
Overall, the safety profiles are similar for FF and HH (although it might be slightly better for FF). There 
was no outstanding difference, and FF is comparable to HH with regard to the TEAE (67.1% vs. 71.7%, 
respectively),  treatment-related  TEAEs  (29.1%  vs.  33.1%,  respectively),  treatment-emergent  serious 
adverse events (TESAEs: 7% vs. 7.9%, respectively), prematurely discontinuation due to TEAEs (9.3% 
vs. 8.3%, respectively), prematurely discontinuation due to TESAEs (3.5% each), and deaths (1 each).

Safety Analysis Set 
For both treatment sequences, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the System Organ Class (SOC) 
Infections and Infestations (36.4% FF vs. 43.3% HH), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(15.9% vs. 12.6%, respectively), investigations (14.3% vs. 11.4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal 
disorders (12.8% vs. 13.8%, respectively). The TEAEs most frequently reported were nasopharyngitis 
(9.3% vs. 10.6%, respectively), unary tract infection (7% vs. 4.3%, respectively), bronchitis (5.4% vs. 
7.9%, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (3.1% vs. 7.1%, respectively), and RA flare (7% vs. 
5.1%,  respectively).  The  difference  in  patient  number  experiencing  TEAEs  (fewer  patients  receiving 
FKB327 FF than Humira HH) is mostly due to fewer non-serious infections.  
For both treatment sequences, treatment-related TEAEs were most frequently reported in the Infections 
and Infestations SOC (15.1% vs. 17.7%, respectively) (bronchitis: 2.3% for FF vs 3.5% for HH), General 
disorders and administration site conditions (injection site reaction: 0.4% vs. 0.8%, respectively), and 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders (anaemia: 0.8% vs. 1.2%, respectively). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
There were no deaths during the Phase 1 studies. 
Phase 3 Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients 
A total of 5 patients died (4 patients receiving FKB327 at the time of death and 1 patient receiving Humira, 
corresponding to death rates of 0.006 and 0.003 per patient-year, respectively).  
During  study  FKB327-002  and  Period  I  of  study  FKB327-003,  2  patients  died  while  on  FKB327  and 
1 patient died on Humira: one patient receiving FKB327 (vial) died from disseminated TB thought to be

related to FKB327 by the investigator (possibly related for the sponsor); one patient receiving FKB327 
(PFS) died from cervical carcinoma and sudden death thought to be related to FKB327 by the investigator 
(possibly  related  for  the  sponsor);  and  one  patient  receiving  Humira  died,  but  the  death  was  ruled 
possibly due to pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease).  
Another  2  patients  died  during  extended  single  arm  treatment  with  FKB327  in  Period  II  of  study 
FKB327-003 (AI): one patient died from pneumonia and chronic sepsis, considered by the Investigator as 
unrelated to FKB327 (possibly related for the sponsor); and one patient died suddenly from either cardiac 
arrest related to arrhythmia or massive cerebrovascular accident, considered as unrelated to FKB327 by 
investigator  and  sponsor.  It  is  possible  that  the  slightly  higher  death  rate  on  FKB327  than  Humira 
observed in these studies was due to chance finding during the longer term exposure to FKB327. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
In  Study  FKB327-001,  1  subject  in  the  FKB327  treatment  group  experienced  the  SAE  of  loss  of 
consciousness and 1 subject in the US-Humira treatment group experienced psychotic disorder and both 
events were considered possibly related to study drug. There were no SAEs in Study FKB327-005. One 
pregnancy was reported for a healthy subject, who elected to undergo termination. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
No pertinent difference in TESAE was noted between FKB327 vial and Humira PFS presentations, with 
most  TESAEs  being  experienced  by  only  1  patient.  The  3  most  reported  SOC  were  infections  and 
infestations,  Injury/poisoning/procedural  complications  and  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and 
unspecified. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 – period I and II 
Generally there was no significant difference in TESAEs reported by any of the treatment schedule groups 
and  most  SAEs  were  only  reported  once.  The  most  reported  SOC  were  infections/infestations  and 
Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue disorders. 
In period I of study FKB327-003, the incidence of TESAEs was generally comparable for patients who 
remained on FKB327 (F-F, 2.3%, 5 patients) compared to those who remained on Humira (H-H: 3.3%, 7 
patients) as well as for patients who switched from Humira to FKB327 (H-F: 4.6%, 5 patients). 
Integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies 
The incidence of TESAEs was similar for FKB327 (0.10 events per patient-year) compared to Humira (0.11 
events  per  patient-year).  The  most  reported  SOC  were  infections/infestations  and  Musculoskeletal  & 
Connective Tissue disorders. 
Long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 period I) 
TESAEs  were  experienced  by  18  patients  (7.0%)  who  remained  on  FKB327  (F-F)  and  by  20  patients 
(7.9%) who remained on Humira (H-H) for up to 1 year. The most frequently reported TESAEs were in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC (4.3% vs. 2.8%, respectively). Finally, Infections and Infestations TEAE 
were also the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation (3.1% vs. 3.9%, respectively).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
Table 39 Study FKB327-002: Summary of Adverse Events of Special Interest: Safety Analysis 
Set  
Overall, 106 patients (29%) with FKB327 and 108 patients (29.8%) with Humira had at least 1 TEAE of 
infection during the study. The most common infections were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection  and  urinary  tract  infection  and  are  expected  in  this  treatment  setting.  There  was  no  major 
difference in the pattern of occurrence of the most common infections across the treatment groups. 
Ten patients (2.7%) with FKB327 and 5 patients (1.4%) with Humira had infections that were considered 
serious.  Most  serious  infections  were  reported  only  once,  making  it  difficult  to  compare  patterns  of 
occurrence. 
Hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to study drug occurred in 14 patients (3.8%) with FKB327 and 7 patients 
(1.9%) with Humira. There were no events of anaphylaxis reported. 
Two patients (0.6%) in the FKB327 group and 2 patients (0.6%) in the Humira group are shown to have 
at least 1 malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder. 
One patient (0.3%) experienced mild neutropenia with FKB327 (none with Humira). 
Thrombocytopenia occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) with both treatments. 
New or worsening of congestive heart failure were reported for 2 patients (0.5%) with FKB327 (none with 
Humira). 
No patient had pancytopaenia or aplastic anaemia, demyelination, or a lupus-like event.

Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 
Table 40 Study FKB327-003: Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Interest: 
Safety Analysis Set 
During period I, there were slightly lower rates of infections on FKB327 than on Humira (22.2% vs. 28%, 
respectively) and serious infection (0.9% vs. 1.6%). 
Comparing FKB327 to Humira, there were lower rates of events potentially indicative of hypersensitivity 
reaction or anaphylaxis to study drug (0.3% vs. 1.9%, respectively), injection site reactions (1.2% vs. 
1.6%, respectively), and congestive heart failure events (0% vs. 0.3%, respectively), and slightly higher 
rates of malignancy (0.3% vs. 0%, respectively) and neutropenia (1.2% vs. 0.3%, respectively). Overall, 
these very low rates are considered comparable. 
No patient had a pancytopenia/aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, demyelination event or a lupus-like 
reaction, although these are known risks with adalimumab.

Integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies 
Table 41 Integrated Analysis of FKB327-002 and FKB327-003: Summary of Adverse Events of 
Special Interest: FKB327-002 Safety Analysis Set 
No  major  differences  were  observed  while  comparing  the  following  adverse  events  of  special  interest 
(AESI)  between  FKB327  and  Humira:  infections  (most  commonly  nasopharyngitis,  UTI,  URTI,  and 
bronchitis),  serious  infection  (low  incidence),  injection  site  reactions  (low  incidence,  most  commonly 
injection site erythema and injection site reaction or pruritus), hypersensitivity reactions (low incidence, 
most commonly rash, allergic dermatitis and urticarial), neutropenia, malignancies, and congestive heart 
failure  (low  incidence).  Although  the  overall  number  of  cases  of  neutropenia  was  small,  there  was  a 
slightly higher incidence on FKB327, with 5 patients receiving FKB327 with 7 events (IR of 0.01 events 
per  patient-year),  compared  to  1 patient  receiving  Humira  with  1 event  (IR  of  0.003 events  per 
patient-year). Six patients on FKB327 (squamous cell carcinoma, plasma cell myeloma, squamous cell 
carcinoma  of  skin,  basal  cell  carcinoma,  breast  cancer,  cervix  carcinoma)  and  2  patients  on  Humira 
(squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma) experienced a malignancy during this study, corresponding to an 
IR of 0.01 events per patient-year for both treatments. Since numbers are low, caution should be applied 
when interpreting these data. 
Long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 period I) 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of special interest were similarly reported in both treatment 
sequences: 
• 
• 
Infections: TEAEs 36.4% FF vs. 43.3% HH (the most common being nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, 
URTI,  and  urinary  tract  infection);  TESAEs  4.3%  (11  patients)  vs.  2.8%  (7  patients), 
respectively. Despite more cases in the FF arm, there was no specific pattern of serious infection, 
and in particular, the number of active tuberculosis cases was 1 vs 3, in favour of FF. 
Injection  site  reaction  to  study  drug:  TEAEs  (related  or  possibly  related)  1.9%  vs.  3.9%, 
respectively (the most common being injection site erythema, injection site reaction and injection 
site pruritus). Injection site pain was lower on FKB327 than Humira (VAS mean of 6.8 vs. 11.1 
respectively), possibly due to the different excipients contained in the products.

• 
Potential  Hypersensitivity  Reactions  or  Anaphylaxis  to  Study  Drug:  TEAEs  (related  or  possibly 
related) 4.7% vs. 3.1%, respectively (the most common being rash and allergic dermatitis). 
•  Neutropenia: TEAEs 1.2% vs. 0.4%, respectively 
• 
Thrombocytopenia: TEAEs 0% vs. 0.4%, respectively 
•  Malignancies or lymphoproliferative disorder: TEAEs 1.2% vs. 0.8%, respectively 
•  Congestive heart failure: 1 patients in FF and no patient in HH 
Other significant adverse events 
Vital signs 
• 
• 
• 
Phase  I  studies:  There  were  no  trends  in  changes  from  Baseline  or  any  clinically  meaningful 
findings for any of the vital signs parameters. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002: There were no trends in changes from Baseline for any of the vital 
signs parameters. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003: There were no trends in changes from Baseline/Week 0 for any of the 
vital signs parameters. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
The studies included in this summary of safety were not designed to formally investigate a QT effect. 
Physical examination 
•  Study phase 1 FKB327-001: One subject had a concomitant non-serious AE of sore throat that 
was  considered  to  be  moderate  in  intensity  and  related  to  study  drug,  and  resolved  after 
treatment with penicillin. 
•  Study phase 1 FKB327-005: Three subjects developed rashes after dosing that were considered 
to  be  clinically  significant  and  were  reported  as  drug-related  TEAEs  and  resolved  without 
treatment. 
• 
• 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002: Several patients had an abnormal physical examination related to 
the patients’ underlying RA and were recorded as AEs, as appropriate. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003: A minority of patients had abnormal findings, and the majority of 
these were musculoskeletal abnormalities and likely related to underlying RA. 
Tuberculosis Testing 
• 
Phase 1 Studies 
All subjects in Study FKB327-001 had a negative TB result at Screening. 
In Study FKB327-005, 1 subject had a false positive TB test. 
• 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
At Screening, the majority of patients (89.0%) had negative test results. At Week 22, the proportion of 
patients with a negative result at Screening who had developed a positive or indeterminate test result was 
similar in both treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 90/141 
 
 
 
 
 
One patient in the Humira treatment group developed a new TEAE of M. tuberculosis at Week 24. Details 
of the follow-up examination are not available but active TB was excluded in this case. 
• 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 
Based on Period I treatment, the proportion of patients with positive or indeterminate results at Week 24 
was 9.4% with FKB327 and 9.1% with Humira. For FKB327, this proportion was slightly decreased from 
the Week 0 result (10.3%), and for Humira the proportion was similar to Week 0 (9.0%). At Week 76 the 
proportion  of  patients  with  positive  or  indeterminate  results  was  6.1%  with  FKB327  and  9.5%  with 
Humira. For both FKB327 and Humira the proportion of positive/indeterminate results at Weeks 0 and 24 
in  this  study  were  similar  to  those  at  Baseline  of  Study  FKB327-002,  however  at  Week  76  a  lower 
proportion  of  patients  were  positive/indeterminate  for  FKB327.  It  should  be  noted  that  a  number  of 
patients  with  positive/indeterminate  tests  were  discontinued  from  this  study  due  to  the  protocol 
requirement for anti-TB prophylaxis. No important difference was seen between FKB327 and Humira in 
this respect. 
Local tolerability 
• 
Phase 1 Studies 
Study FKB327-001: The majority of subjects did not experience any evidence of irritation at the injection 
site. Pain at the injection site was assessed using VAS. Immediately post dose, subjects in the FKB327 
treatment group (vial) reported less injection pain than subjects in the Humira treatment groups. 
Tolerability was not assessed in Study FKB327-005. 
• 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
For  the  injection  site  reaction,  at  day  1,  there  were  no  important  differences  observed  between  the 
treatment groups, though the VAS assessed injection site pain was lower in the FKB327 group. 
During the overall study, the incidence of injection site reactions reported as AEs was slightly lower with 
FKB327 (8 patients - 2.2%) than with Humira (14 patients - 3.9%), mostly due to a difference in reported 
injection site erythema and injection site reactions. 
• 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 
At Week 0, the majority of patients had no evidence of irritation (FKB327 94.4% and Humira 95.6%). For 
the small number of patients who did have an injection site reaction (18 patients with FKB327 and 14 with 
Humira),  the  majority  had  minimal  erythema  (barely  visible)  and  only  1  patient  in  either  group  had 
definite erythema (readily visible)/minimal oedema or minimal popular response. Similar results were 
observed across the treatment sequences. 
At Week 30, of the 554 patients with an injection site assessment (regardless of presentation), most 
(96.6%)  had  no  evidence  of  irritation.  Four  patients  experienced  an  injection  site  reaction  that  was 
graded at higher than 2 (erythema [readily visible]/minimal oedema or minimal popular response) at 
Week 30 (1 in each treatment sequence: F-F-F, F-H-F, H-F-F and H-H-F). 
Of the 507 patients who switched to the AI presentation, 490 had an injection site assessment recorded 
at the time of switch (Week 30), and the majority (96.5%) had no evidence of irritation. There was no 
evidence of any difference in injection site reactions between presentations. 
Likewise, the overall incidence of injection site reactions to study drug reported as TEAEs was similar 
between  FKB327  and  Humira  (0.059  vs.  0.080  events  per  patient-year),  and  the  most  frequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 91/141 
 
 
 
 
 
reported injection site reactions were injection site erythema and injection site reaction. No events were 
considered to be serious. 
At Week 0, the mean VAS injection site pain score was twice as high on Humira as on FKB327 (12.9 vs. 
6.2),  possibly  due  to  the  different  excipients  in  the  2  formulations;  however  a  substantial  number  of 
scores were missing on both arms. At Week 30, for the 479 patients who had an injection site pain VAS 
recorded, regardless of presentation, overall mean VAS score (5.2) was lower than the values observed 
for either FKB327 or Humira at Week 0. Of the 507 patients who switched to the AI presentation, 425 had 
an injection site pain VAS score recorded at the time of switch, and the mean VAS score was 4.8. 
In summary, the data indicate no tolerability concerns with the AI presentation compared with the PFS 
one. 
• 
Integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies 
An injection site assessment and an injection site VAS assessment was performed within 30 minutes of 
W0 dosing in FKB327-002 and FKB327-003 (Week 24 overall), and within 30 minutes of W30 dosing with 
FKB327 (PFS or AI) in FKB327-003 (Week 54 overall).

No important differences were observed in injection site assessments between the FKB327 and Humira 
treatment groups or as a result of switching treatments. With respect to injection site pain, there was an 
improvement in pain scores from Baseline of Study FKB327-002 to Week 30 of Study FKB327-002 in all 
treatment  sequences.  At  both  Baseline  and  Week  0,  the  highest  mean  VAS  scores  were  observed  for 
patients  receiving  Humira  compared  to  FKB327.  When  all  patients  received  FKB327  in  Period  II,  the 
greatest pain diminutions (from Week 0) were observed for patients who switched from Humira.

Laboratory findings 
Phase 1 Study FKB327-001 
There were several trends in change from baseline in mean values for the hematology, biochemistry and 
urinalysis parameters that followed the same pattern in all treatment groups.  
In total, 9 subjects had clinically significant abnormal laboratory results, including low neutrophil counts, 
low platelet count, and increases in ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST). 
Phase 1 Study FKB327-005 
There were no notable trends in change from baseline in mean values for the hematology, biochemistry 
and urinalysis parameters for any treatment group.  
Transient  reductions  were  seen  in  leukocytes  and  neutrophils  for  multiple  subjects  but  were  not 
considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator.  
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from  baseline  in  mean  values  for  any  of  the  haematology, 
biochemistry or urinalysis parameters, with the exception of ESR where a decrease was observed over 
time for both the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups. 
Several patients experienced changes in laboratory parameters that were reported as non-serious TEAEs, 
the most common ones being hypercholesterolaemia, anaemia and dyslipidaemia.

EMA/541826/2018  
Page 93/141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from  Baseline/Week  0  in  mean  values  for  any  of  the 
hematology, biochemistry or urinalysis parameters, and no patterns in the laboratory parameters could 
be discerned. 
TEAEs related to changes in clinical laboratory parameters occurred in a number of patients during the 
study  period.  None  of  the  most  common  laboratory-related  TEAEs  was  considered  serious  and  the 
majority were mild in intensity. 
Positive M. tuberculosis complex test was a frequently observed event, occurring in 9 patients receiving 
FKB327 and 8 patients receiving Humira during Period I and by 4 patients receiving FKB327 in Period II, 
which was a result of protocol requirements. 
In Period I, anaemia was reported as a TEAE for 5 patients receiving FKB327 PFS and 4 patients receiving 
Humira  PFS.  Hypochromic  anaemia  and  normochromic  normocytic  anaemia  were  each  reported  by  a 
single patient receiving Humira. Leukopenia and neutropenia were each reported by 3 patients receiving 
FKB327 and 1 patient receiving Humira. TEAEs related to liver function test abnormalities were reported 
by slightly more patients receiving FKB327 than Humira. A TEAE of abnormal urine analysis was reported 
for 3 patients receiving FKB327. TEAEs related to metabolism or nutrition disorders were experienced by 
similar numbers of patients receiving FKB327 and Humira. Haematuria was experienced by 3 patients on 
FKB327 and 2 patients on Humira. Leukocyturia was experienced by 1 patient on FKB327 and 2 patients 
on Humira. Other TEAEs related to changes in clinical laboratory parameters occurred in single patients. 
In Period II, anaemia was reported as a TEAE by 11 patients; ALT increased by 10 patients; CRP increased 
and dyslipidaemia by 8 patients; AST increased by 7 patients; blood creatinine increased, GGT increased, 
transaminases  increased,  WBC  count  increased,  and  hyperglycaemia  by  3  patients;  leukopenia, 
neutropenia,  hypothyroidism,  blood  cholesterol  increased,  blood  urea  increased,  hepatic  enzyme 
increased,  neutrophil  count  increased,  hypercholesterolaemia,  hyponatraemia,  and  haematuria  by  2 
patients. Other TEAEs related to changes in clinical laboratory parameters occurred in single patients. 
As FKB327 has been developed as a proposed biosimilar product to Humira, no comparison has been 
made between FKB327 and Humira in special patient sub-groups or situations. Patients with significant 
renal and/or hepatic impairment were excluded from the clinical studies.

The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  similar  for  the  vial  and  PFS  groups  (60.6%  and  58.7%  subjects, 
respectively), and higher in the AI group (72.7% of subjects). The higher incidence in the AI group was 
largely due to a greater incidence of nasopharyngitis, injection site rash, vessel puncture site pain and 
vessel  puncture  site  bruise  in  this  group.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  in  all  3  groups  were  mild  in  severity 
(94.6%  of  all  TEAEs).  No  severe  TEAEs  or  SAEs  were  reported  by  any  subjects,  and  no  subjects 
discontinued due to TEAEs.  
All TEAEs related to the injection site were considered TEADRs and were mild in severity. 
For the 3 subjects reporting TEAEs of injection site reaction, 2 subjects were noted to have high ADA titre 
and 1 subject had moderate ADA titre shortly after the event. An eventual relationship with TEHAEs was 
not been discussed.

Anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
ADA  development  for  the  FKB327  presentations  (vial,  PFS,  AI)  was  evaluated  throughout  Study 
FKB327-002 (24 weeks) and Periods I and II of Study FKB327-003 (+76 weeks in patients who proceeded 
to FKB327-003 study).

Overall ADA positive ratios in FKB327 and Humira treatment groups in the FKB327-002 study were 9.9% 
and 12.1% at Week 2, 38.8% and 35.6% at Week 4, 57.2% and 52.5% at Week 12, 62.0% and 59.4% 
at  Week 24,  respectively,  showing  that  the  frequency  of  ADA  positive  samples  increased  similarly 
between both treatment groups and reached plateau at Week 24 in both groups. At the end of this period, 
there was a 3% difference in favour of Humira. 
During period I of the Study FKB327-003, the relevant population to compare immunogenicity consists of 
the patients who are maintained on the same product as in the previous study (216 patients on FKB327 
and 212 patients on Humira). Similar rates were observed in these subgroups as in the whole population 
during Study FKB327-002, with rates at Week 24 of 61.6% and 58.0%, respectively. During period I, the 
rates tended to decrease in both subgroups and, at Week 48, the same rate of 50.8% was reported. In the 
smaller subgroups of patients that switched product at the start of period I, at Week 48, a decrease in 
positive rates was also observed (58.0% in F-H and 49.0% in H-F). This finding is reassuring. 
With  regard  to  ADA  development  by  each  FKB327  presentation  (i.e.,  vial,  PFS,  AI),  in  the  FKB327 
treatment continuous group (i.e., F-F-F group), the ADA positive ratio increased during the  course of 
FKB327-002 study, and reached a plateau at Week 24, being observed in 61.1% of patients treated by 
FKB327-vial.  ADA  did  not increase  in  Period  I  in  patients  who  were  switched to  FKB327-PFS  (52.4%, 
FKB327-003 beginning of Period II Week 30) and in Period II in which the majority of patients who were 
switched  to  FKB327-AI  (51.1%  FKB327-003  Week 76).  A  similar  pattern  was  observed  for  the  other 
sequences  (F-H-F,  H-F-F  and  H-H-F).  Therefore,  the  switch  to  FKB327-PFS  and  FKB327-AI  did  not 
increase ADA activity.

Analysis Set 
Overall, mean ADA titre increased in all treatment sequences during Study FKB327-002. Mean ADA titre 
continued  to increase  during  Period  I  of  FKB327-003  (to the  beginning  of  Period  II  –  Week  30)  in  all 
treatment sequences with the exception of the F-F-F treatment sequence, where the mean ADA titre at 
Week 24 was lower than  at Week 12 (mainly due to 2 patients who shown unusually high ADA titres 
without  any  specific  clinical  cause).  Then,  in  Period  II  (full  set  of  data  to  week  76),  mean  ADA  titre 
decreased  in  all  treatment  sequences.  In  conclusion,  overall  ADA  titre  profiles  across  the  treatment 
sequences are highly similar and numerical differences are considered to be not clinically significant.

Neutralising Antibody (nAb) 
The frequency of neutralizing ADA (Nab) positive samples was almost equivalent to the frequency of ADA 
positive patients in the course of Studies FKB327-002 and FKB327-003. 
With  regard  to  Nab  development  by  each  FKB327  presentation  (i.e.,  vial,  PFS,  AI),  in  the  FKB327 
treatment  continuous  group  (i.e.,  F-F-F  group),  the  Nab  positive  ratio  increased  during  the  course  of 
FKB327-002 study, and reached a plateau at Week 24, being observed in 60.6% of patients treated by 
FKB327-vial.  Nab  did  not  increase  in  Period  I  in  patients  who  were  switched  to  FKB327-PFS  (52.4%, 
FKB327-003 beginning of Period II Week 30) and in Period II in which the majority of patients who were 
switched to FKB327-AI (51.1% Week 76). A similar pattern was observed for the other sequences (F-H-F, 
H-F-F and H-H-F). Therefore, the switch to FKB327-PFS and FKB327-AI did not increase Nab activity.

Treatment-emergent Hypersensitivity Adverse Events (TEHAE) by ADA Titre or neutralizing ADA 
(Nab) 
1.  Comparison of TEHAE by ADA Titre and Nab between FKB327 and Humira 
Overall TEHAE were observed at a relatively low incidence across both treatment groups (0.03 events per 
patient-year (IR) for FKB327 and 0.05 IR for Humira) during the overall period from Study FKB327-002 
to Period II of Study FKB327-003 (integrated analysis). There were no events of anaphylaxis reported 
and no cases of anaphylaxis.  
By  ADA  status,  the  overall  incidence  rate  of  TEHAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  patients  who  developed 
moderate and high ADA titre in both FKB327 and Humira treatment groups (0.011 and 0.020 in low ADA 
titre, 0.035 and 0.041 in moderate ADA titre, 0.047 and 0.091 in high ADA titre, respectively). This trend 
was observed especially in the system organ class (SOC) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in both 
FKB327 and Humira group (0.005 and 0.010 in low ADA titre, 0.028 and 0.034 in moderate ADA titre, 
0.036  and  0.080  in  high  ADA  titre,  respectively)  and  SOC  Immune  system  disorders  such  as 
hypersensitivity in both FKB327 and Humira group (0.000 and 0.000 in low ADA titre, 0.003 and 0.000 in 
moderate ADA titre, 0.010 and 0.011 in high ADA titre, respectively).  
By Nab status, higher incidence rate were observed in patients who detected positive for Nab in both 
FKB327 and Humira similarly (0.012 – 2 events and 0.011 – 1 event in negative Nab, 0.039 – 19 events 
and 0.062 – 15 events in positive Nab, respectively), especially in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (0.006 and 0.000 in negative Nab, 0.030 and 0.053 in positive Nab) and SOC Immune system 
disorders (0.000 and 0.000 in negative Nab, 0.006 and 0.004 in positive Nab, respectively). However, the 
incidence  rate  was  low  for  both  the  FKB327  and  Humira  treatment  groups  with  very  low  numbers  of 
events.  
2.  Comparison of TEHAE by ADA Titre and Nab by FKB327 Presentation 
In FKB327003 period I and II, the overall incidence rates of TEHAEs for patients who received FKB327 AI 
(0.018 – 5 events) was slightly higher than with PFS (0.005 – 1 event). However, the incidence rate was 
low for both presentations with very low numbers of events. 
The incidence rates of TEHAE by ADA status were slightly higher in high ADA titre with AI (0.056 – 4 
events) compared to moderate (0.009 – 1 event) and low ADA titre (0), and compare to PFS (high ADA 
titre:  0.019 –  1  event,  moderate  and  low  ADA  titres:  0).  There  were  3  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders in high ADA titre with AI, and 1 event of hypersensibility in both AI and PFS high ADA titre. 
Finally, there was 1 event of eyelid oedema with AI in moderate ADA.

The incidence of TEHAEs in Nab positive patients was also slightly higher especially in patients who were 
administered the AI presentation (0.025 – 5 events with AI and 0.007 – 1 event with PFS in positive Nab, 
and 0.000 and 0.000 in negative Nab); same events as described above.

Incidence and Severity of Injection-Site Reactions by ADA Titre or neutralizing ADA (Nab) 
1.  Comparison of Injection-Site Reactions by ADA Titre and Nab between FKB327 and Humira 
The incidence of injection-site reactions at Week 0 of Study FKB327-002 was 13/332 patients (4.0%) for 
the FKB327-vial group, which was comparable with 14/317 patients (4.4%) for the Humira-PFS group. 
The  incidence  of  injection-site  reactions  was  18/322 patients  (5.6%)  for  the  FKB327-PFS  and  14/317 
patients (4.4%) for the Humira-PFS at Week 0 in Period I of Study FKB327-003. The overall incidence of 
injection-site reactions in both the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups was relatively low (with low 
grade).  
The incidence of injection-site reactions by ADA and Nab status for FKB327 and Humira was presented at 
FKB327-002  week  0,  FKB327-003  week  0  (week  24  from  the  beginning)  and  FKB327-003  -  week  30 
(week  54  from  the  beginning).  There  was  no  clear  increase  in  the  grade  of  injection-site  reaction  for 
patients with a high ADA titre or a positive Nab for either treatment group.  
2.  Comparison of Injection-site Reactions by ADA Titre and Nab by FKB327 Presentation 
At week 30 of FKB327-003 (day 1 of Period II), the applicant has compared the incidence of injection-site 
reactions in 487 patients who received FKB327 via the AI and 65 patients enrolled in the United States 
(US) who received FKB327 via the PFS. The incidence of injection-site reactions was not related to ADA 
titre or Nab in either presentation. However, the number of patients having received PFS was too low to 
allow a proper comparison.  
Injection-site reactions including all PFB327 presentations (ie. Vial, PFS, AI) were overall also comparable 
in all Phase III studies by ADA and Nab status. 
Comparative PK Study FKB327-004 (supportive study) 
Study FKB327-004 was a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, parallel-group, single-dose study to compare 
pharmacokinetic  characteristics  and  safety  of  FKB327  with  those  of  US-licensed  Humira  in  Japanese 
healthy male subjects. This study is considered as supportive for the immunogenicity assessment. 
A relatively high frequency of ADA was detected in both treatment groups, attaining a level of >98% at 
day 65, with a relatively high frequency of nAb (although slightly lower than ADA), attaining a level of 
>80% of subjects were positive for nAb at Day 65. 
Comparison across the treatment groups indicated similar frequencies of confirmed ADA positive and nAb 
positive samples at each time-point. 
Although there was a higher apparent incidence of injection site reactions in the US-Humira treatment 
group, the numbers of events are too small to conclude that there was a real difference between the 
treatments. 
Thus, these results are supportive of a conclusion of biosimilarity of FKB327 and Humira.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
There were no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the Phase 1 studies. Two pregnancy-related 
discontinuations occurred, one in each study. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002 
Fourteen patients (3.8%) and 10 patients (2.8%) in the FKB327 vial and Humira PFS treatment groups, 
respectively, experienced a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. Most TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation  were  reported  only  once,  with  the  exception  of  latent  tuberculosis,  disseminated 
tuberculosis, pulmonary tuberculosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive. 
Seven point four per cent (7.4%) of the patients in the FKB327 treatment group and 10.5% of patients in 
the Humira treatment group experienced a TEAE leading to temporary interruption. The most common 
TEAE leading to temporary treatment interruption was nasopharyngitis, which was reported for a similar 
proportion of patients in the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups. 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-003 – period I 
In period I of study FKB327-003: 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to discontinuation was generally comparable for 
patients who remained on FKB327 (F-F, 4.6%) compared to those who remained on Humira (H-H, 
5.2%). For patients who switched from Humira to FKB327, there was no increase compared to 
H-H reference (H-F, 3.7%). 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs  leading  to  temporary  treatment  interruption  was 
comparable for patients who remained on FKB327 (F-F, 8.8%) compared to those who remained 
on Humira (H-H, 9.4%). For patients who switched from Humira to FKB327, there was a small 
increase  compared  to  H-H  reference  (H-F,  13.0%).  The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to 
temporary treatment interruption were in the Infections and infestations SOC. 
Integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was similar for FKB327 (0.09 events per patient-year) 
and  Humira  (0.07  events  per  patient-year).  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  most  frequently 
reported for the SOC Infections and infestations. 
Long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 period I) 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation was similar for patients in F-F 
(9.3%) and H-H treatment sequence (8.3%); Infections and Infestations TEAE being the most frequent 
reason  for  discontinuation.  Overall,  the  number  of  patients  with  a  particular  TEAE  (PT)  causing 
discontinuation was low, and the majority were reported for single patients. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  Safety  Analysis  Set  in  Study  FKB327-002  comprised  366  patients  treated  with  FKB327  and  362 
patients treated with Humira. Of these patients, 216 patients on FKB327 and 213 on Humira proceeded to 
the FF and HH treatment sequences in Study FKB327-003, respectively, and 189 patients on FKB327 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 105/141 
 
 
 
 
 
190 on Humira completed Period I (1-year data). For the 1-year safety comparison, the safety profile for 
258  patients  in  the  FF  sequence  (including  216  patients  from  FKB327-003  FF  and  42  patients  who 
received FKB327 in Study FKB327-002 but did not enter Study FKB327-003) has been compared to the 
safety profile for 254 patients in the HH sequence (including 213 patients from FKB327-003 HH and 41 
patients who received Humira in Study FKB327-002 but did not enter Study FKB327-003). 
The integrated analysis of Phase 3 Studies concerns all patients who received at least 1 dose of either 
FKB327 or Humira during the 2 Phase 3 studies. Patients who switched products are included in both 
treatment  groups  for  the  relevant  duration  of  exposure.  Overall,  in  FKB327-002  and  FKB327-003, 
exposure was 837.26 patient-years for FKB327 and 336.01 patient-years for Humira. The lower exposure 
to Humira is due to all patients switching to FKB327 for Period II of the FKB327-003 study. 
Adverse events 
Overall, the safety profile was similar between FKB327 and the US-licensed and EU-approved Humira in 
the Phase I study FKB327-001, and was consistent with the known events associated with adalimumab 
treatment. However, the incidence of subjects with at least 1 TEAE is slightly lower with FKB327 (58.3%) 
compared to US-Humira (60%) which is slightly lower with EU-Humira (65%). Similar trend is seen for 
subjects with at least 1 treatment-related TEAE (50%, 53.3%, and 58.3%, respectively). However, the 
sample size was too small to draw any meaningful conclusions from these potential differences. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, 
oropharyngeal pain and injection site hematoma. Overall, these TEAE were reported for similar numbers 
of subjects in each treatment group with some isolated differences. Similar observations were made for 
treatment-related TEAE.  
Overall, FKB327 was comparable to Humira with regards to the overall safety profile following 24 weeks 
of exposure, with no major outstanding differences observed in the Phase 3 study FKB327-002. In both 
groups,  the  most  common  TEAEs  occurred  in  the  SOC  Infections  and  infestations,  Gastrointestinal 
disorders, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders with similar rate in both groups. However, 
with  FKB327  compared  with  Humira,  TEAEs  (55.5%  vs.  61.6%,  respectively)  and  treatment-related 
TEAEs (20.2% vs. 23.2%, respectively) were slightly less reported. These differences could be chance 
findings given the small numbers of each type of event. 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 TEAE is slightly lower with the sequence F-F (47.7%) compared 
to the sequence H-H (54.9%) and a similar trend is seen for subjects with at least 1 treatment-related 
TEAE (18.1% vs. 23%, respectively) in the Phase 3 study FKB327-003 period I. Overall, review of the 
incidence  of  AEs  showed  that  there  was  no  major  outstanding  difference  between  switching  and 
non-switching treatment sequences (H-F, F-H, F-F and H-H). Patient and event numbers per sequence 
are too low for the observed differences to be regarded as clinically relevant in the absence of a consistent 
trend. 
There were no major differences between the safety profiles of the different treatment sequences (F-H-F, 
F-F-F, H-F-F and H-H-F) during period II and the whole study period in the Phase 3 study FKB327-003. 
From the integrated analysis of phase 3 studies, the safety profiles of FKB327 and Humira, overall, are 
comparable  with  regards  to  the  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  severe  TEAE, 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events TEAE (TESAE), treatment-related TEAE, and discontinuation 
or interruption (due to TEAE or TESAE). However, the incidence was slightly lower with FKB327 compared 
to Humira for TEAE (2.00 vs. 2.69, respectively) and treatment-related TEAE (0.56 vs. 0.74). Treatment 
related TEAEs were most frequently reported for the SOC Infections and infestations. The most common 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018

treatment  related  TEAEs  were  injection  site  erythema,  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infection,  latent 
tuberculosis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  bronchitis,  pharyngitis,  pneumonia,  sinusitis, 
Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis 
complex 
test  positive,  alanine  aminotransferase 
increased, 
hypercholesterolaemia, and RA flare. The incidence rates of these treatment-related TEAEs were broadly 
comparable  between  treatments.  Findings  are  compatible  with  the  safety  profile  for  Humira,  per  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In the long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 part I), the long-term (1-year) 
safety profile of FKB327 (F-F) was overall comparable to Humira (H-H), though the incidence of TEAEs 
and  treatment-related  TE  was  slightly  lower  for  F-F  patients  compared  to  other  treatment  sequences 
(H-H, F-H & H-F). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were no deaths during the Phase 1 studies. In the Phase 3 Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients, 
a  total  of  5 patients  died  (4 patients  receiving  FKB327  at  the  time  of  death  and  1 patient  receiving 
Humira, corresponding to death rates of 0.006 and 0.003 per patient-year, respectively). 
In Phase 3 Study FKB327-002, no pertinent difference in TESAE  was  noted between FKB327 vial and 
Humira PFS presentations, with most TESAEs being experienced by only 1 patient. 
In Phase 3 Study FKB327-003, generally, there was no significant difference in TESAEs reported by any 
of the treatment schedule groups.  In period I, the incidence of TESAEs was generally comparable for 
patients who remained on FKB327 (F-F) compared to those who remained on Humira (H-H). For patients 
who switched from Humira to FKB327 (F-H), there was a slight increase compared to H-H reference in the 
incidence of TESAEs. Overall, the number of patients with TESAEs was low and the majority was reported 
for single patients, making it difficult to make comparisons across the treatment sequences. 
In  the  integrated  analysis  of  the  Phase  3  studies,  the  incidence  of  TESAEs  was  similar  for  FKB327 
compared  to  Humira.  The  most  reported  SOC  were  infections/infestations  and  Musculoskeletal  & 
Connective Tissue disorders. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Overall, there were no major differences for AESI (infections, serious infections, injection site reactions, 
hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, malignancies, and congestive heart failure) in 
study FKB327-0002 between FKB327 and Humira, in study FKB327-0003 period I between FKB327 and 
Humira, in the integrated analysis of the Phase 3 studies between FKB327 and Humira, or in the 1-year 
safety  comparison  between  F-H  and  H-H.  No  patient  had  pancytopaenia  or  aplastic  anaemia, 
demyelination, or a lupus-like event. 
Other significant adverse events 
The  safety  profile  of  FKB327  was  similar  to  that  for  Humira,  as  assessed  by  vital  signs,  physical 
examination findings, and TB testing. 
No important differences were observed in injection site assessments between the FKB327 and Humira 
treatment groups or as a result of switching treatments. In general, the trend seems to indicate that 
FKB327 has a better injection site pain profile compared to Humira. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 107/141 
 
 
 
 
 
Extensive patient data (n=507) from study FKB327-003 showed no evidence that the use of an AI was 
associated  with  worse 
local 
tolerance  compared 
to  PFS.  On 
the  contrary,  spontaneous 
treatment-emergent  reports  as  well  as  systematic  injection  site  assessment  suggested  slightly  less 
reactions and pain with the AI. Only 4 patients (0.7%) had a Grade 2 reaction (definite erythema [readily 
visible]/minimal oedema or minimal popular response) with the AI and the mean injection pain evaluated 
on a visual analogue scale was similar or lower when switching from the PFS to the AI. 
Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  clinically  important  trends  in  any  of  the  haematology,  biochemistry  or  urinalysis 
parameters during the clinical development programme. 
Safety in special populations 
Concomitant anti-rheumatic drugs: 
In phase 3 study FKB327-002, the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups were well matched with respect 
to concomitant, stable, background treatment for RA. A similar proportion of patients in the FKB327 and 
Humira  treatment  groups  were  receiving  concomitant  oral  steroids  for  RA  (most  common  being 
methylprednisolone and prednisone) and concomitant NSAIDs for RA (most common being meloxicam 
and diclofenac). 
In phase 3 study FKB327-003 period I, the proportion of patients receiving concomitant oral steroids for 
RA  and/or  concomitant  NSAIDs  for  RA  was  broadly  similar  for  the  2  treatments  with  similar  average 
concomitant MTX doses (same most common concomitant oral steroids and concomitant NSAIDs as in 
FKB327-002).  
In  the  overall  study  FKB327-003,  the  proportion  of  patients  receiving  concomitant  oral  steroids  and 
concomitant NSAIDs for RA was higher for the F-H-F treatment sequence and lower in the F-F-F treatment 
sequence compared to the other sequences  
Medical history and concurrent medical condition 
Overall, in phase 3 studies, past and concurrent medical history (excluding RA reported by all patients) 
were reported with similar proportions in both the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups and in each 
sequence treatments. 
Immunological events 
In  the  Phase  I  study  FKB327-001,  FKB327  seemed  overall  comparable  to  US-licensed  Humira  and 
EU-approved Humira in terms of the following parameters: ADA and nAb frequency at all time-points, 
ADA titer distribution at Day 65, and incidence and severity of injection site reactions. However, due to 
the uncertainties related to the numerous inconclusive samples in the assays, no conclusion can be drawn 
on the comparability of the immunogenicity profiles of FKB327 and EU-Humira and US-Humira for the 
healthy subjects included in this study (See section 2.4). 
In the Phase 3 Studies FKB327-002 and FKB327-003, ADA development for the FKB327 presentations 
(vial, PFS, AI) was evaluated throughout Study FKB327-002 (24 weeks) and Periods I and II of Study 
FKB327-003 (+76 weeks in patients who proceeded to FKB327-003 study).  
The frequency of neutralizing ADA (Nab) positive samples was almost equivalent to the frequency of ADA 
positive patients in the course of Studies FKB327-002 and FKB327-003.  
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018  
Page 108/141 
 
 
 
 
 
In  patients  maintained  on  the  same  product  (F-F  or  US  H-H)  for  48  weeks,  the  frequency  of  positive 
samples  for  binding  and  neutralising  ADA  increased  up  to  Week  24  (around  60%),  then  started  to 
decrease to plateau at about 50%. The same rate was reported at Week 48 with both products. It is 
reassuring that the ADA rates did not increase when patients were switched from one product to another 
(F-H and H-F) and that ADA rates similarly decreased in these patients. 
There were no major differences in ADA frequency, Nab positive rate and ADA titre distribution among 
treatments via FKB327 presentations (ie. vial, PFS and AI), and these were not increased when switching 
during the course of Study FKB327-002 and Period I and Period II of Study FKB327-003.  
During  the  overall  period  from  Study FKB327-002  to  Period  II  of  Study FKB327-003  (integrated 
FKB327-002  Safety  Analysis  Set),  TEHAE  were  observed  at  a  relatively  low  incidence  across  both 
treatment groups (FKB327 and Humira). By ADA or Nab status, the overall incidence rate of TEHAEs was 
similar in both treatment groups. 
The overall incidence of injection-site reactions was low and similar in the FKB327 and Humira treatment 
groups (with low grade). There was no clear increase in the grade of injection-site reaction for patients 
with a high ADA titre or a positive Nab for either treatment group. Injection-site reactions including all 
PFB327 presentations (ie. Vial, PFS, AI) were overall also comparable in all Phase III studies by ADA and 
Nab status. 
The observed ADA level (50-60%) is much higher to what is established in the SmPC of Humira for the RA 
population  (5%).  This  difference  could  be  due  to  a  much  more  sensitive  assay.  Moreover,  for  both 
products, although the safety profile seems quite similar, there is a decrease of the efficacy associated 
with an increase of ADA and Nab during time. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
There were no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the Phase 1 studies. Overall, 3.8% of FKB327 
vial patients and 2.8% of Humira PFS patients experienced a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation in 
Phase 3 Study FKB327-002. Additionally, 7.4% of FKB327 vial patients and 10.5% of Humira PFS patients 
experienced a TEAE leading to temporary interruption. 
In Study FKB327-003 – Period I, the proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 
generally comparable for patients who remained on FKB327 (F-F) compared to those who remained on 
Humira  (H-H)  and  compared  to  patients  who  switched  (H-F).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs 
leading to temporary treatment interruption was comparable for patients who remained on FKB327 (F-F) 
compared to those who remained on Humira (H-H). For patients who switched (H-F), there was a small 
increase compared to H-H. The most common TEAEs leading to temporary treatment interruption were in 
the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC.  Overall,  the  number  of  patients  particular  TEAE  leading  to 
discontinuation or temporary treatment interruption was low and the majority were reported for single 
patients, making it difficult to make comparisons across the treatment sequences. 
In the integrated Analysis of Phase 3 Studies the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation and to 
temporary  treatment  interruption  was  comparable  for  FKB327  and  Humira.  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were most frequently reported for the SOC Infections and infestations.  
In the long-term (1-Year) Safety Comparison (FKB327-002 / FKB327-003 period I), the proportion of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation was similar for patients in F-F and H-H treatment 
sequence;  Infections  and  Infestations  TEAE  being  the  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation.  To 
complete  the  set  of  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  from  study  FKB327-003  CSR,  the  applicant  has

committed to submit the final report of the pivotal Phase 3 study FKB327-003 by 31 October 2018 (see 
RMP section). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, up to 1-year, the descriptive comparison of safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability profile 
of FKB327 and Humira did not reveal any major differences between both treatments.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed biosimilar FKB327 is intended for all of the therapeutic indications approved for Humira in 
the EU: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 
enthesitis-related  arthritis),  axial  spondyloarthritis  (ankylosing  spondylitis  and  axial  spondyloarthritis 
without  radiographic  evidence  of  AS),  psoriatic  arthritis,  psoriasis,  paediatric  plaque  psoriasis, 
hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease, paediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, uveitis and 
paediatric uveitis. 
Three  pharmaceutical  forms  are  proposed,  which  are  similar  to  three  of  the  pharmaceutical  forms  of 
Humira and contain a 40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection: a vial (for paediatric use), a pre-filled syringe 
and a pre-filled pen (all of a volume of 0.8 mL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
This is a biosimilar application to Humira. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  claim  of  biosimilarity  is  based  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence  including  analytical,  nonclinical  and 
clinical data. The comparability exercise is mainly based on the following studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018 
Page 132/141 
 
 
  
 
•  Analytical studies: primary structure, glycosylation, higher order structure, size heterogeneity, 
charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic heterogeneity, amino acid modifications, process-related 
impurities, visible and sub-visible particles, strength; 
• 
Functional studies: binding to target antigen (soluble rhTNFα, tmTNFα); binding to FC receptors 
FcγR (I, IIa, IIb, IIIa (V and F), IIIb (NA1 and NA2) and FcRn; binding to C1q; Fab-associated 
functions (cytotoxicity neutralisation, apoptosis); Fc-associated functions (ADCC, CDC); 
• 
FKB327-001:  A  single-dose  (40  mg  sc)  three-arm  parallel  PK  trial  in  healthy  volunteers 
comparing FKB327, EU- and US-sourced reference products; 
• 
FKB327-002:  A  phase  III  Randomised,  Blinded,  Active-Controlled  Study  to  Compare  FKB327 
Efficacy  and  Safety  with  the  US-sourced  Humira  in  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  Patients 
Inadequately Controlled on Methotrexate  
In  addition,  the  Applicant  conducted  Study  FKB327-003  which  was  an  Open-label  Extension  Study  to 
Compare the Long term Efficacy, Safety, Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics of FKB327 and Humira in 
Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis on Concomitant Methotrexate (ARABESC-OLE). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From a quality and non-clinical point of view, the biological function parameters such as neutralization of 
soluble  TNF-α  induced  cytotoxicity  in  L929  cells,  induction  of  apoptosis  in  mTNF-α  expressing  cells, 
binding to Fcγ receptors and FcRn; binding to C1q; ADCC activity and CDC activity in mTNF-α cells were 
found to be similar between FKB327 and the reference product Humira.  
With respect to the clinical pharmacokinetics, the development program to demonstrate the similarity 
between Hulio and Humira is adequate and was performed according to the guidance on similar biological 
products and the recommendations given in the CHMP Scientific Advices. The comparability exercise was 
performed between EU/US sourced reference products and the formulation intended to be marketed in 
the European Union. Using ANCOVA, biosimilarity is demonstrated as the 90% CI for PK parameters are 
in the acceptance range of 80-125%. The introduction of covariates in the statistical analysis (ANCOVA) 
helps to reduce the variability introduced by using patients with possibly different baseline characteristics 
on each treatment arm and is used instead of ANOVA. ANCOVA was pre-specified in the SAP and deemed 
justified for a parallel design of a monoclonal antibody with the aim to increase precision.  
A statistical comparison for the Ctrough pre-dose concentrations (at weeks 4, 12, 20 and 24 and at weeks 
12, 24 and 30 in the phase III studies FKB327-002 and 003 respectively) has been carried out by the 
Applicant.  The  small  differences  in  mean  trough  serum  drug  concentrations  observed  in  the  clinical 
studies are not expected to result in clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety. 
From  an  efficacy  perspective,  equivalence  between  FKB327  and  Humira  was  demonstrated  through 
assessment  of  the  ACR20  RR  at  week  24  in  the  pivotal  equivalence  trial  FKB327-002.  The  ACR20  RR 
difference  (FKB327  vs  Humira-  measured  in  the  FAS  with  RCI  for  missing  data)  was  -1.3%  (95%  CI 
-7.6,5.0),  of  which  the  95%  CI  lies  within  the  prespecified  +/-  13%  equivalence  range.  Similarly, 
equivalence  was  demonstrated  when  the  ACR20  RR  difference  was  analysed  in  the  PPAS  (difference 
FKB327  vs  Humira  -0.4,  95%  CI  -6.7,5.9).  DAS28-CRP  difference  at  week  24  was  0.01  (95%  CI 
-0.17,0.18) in the FAS and -0.03 (95% CI -0.21,0.15) in the PPAS with both 95% CI narrower than the 
predefined +/- 0.6 margin. Equivalence was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis with variable imputations 
for  missing  data.  ACR20,  ACR50  and  ACR70  RR  for  FKB327  and  Humira  did  not  differ  significantly  at 
different time points from week 0 to week 24 in study FKB327-002. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018 
Page 133/141 
 
 
  
Maintenance of efficacy up to 1 year of treatment, both in patients that continued on their initial treatment 
and in patients that switched between adalimumab presentations, was demonstrated in the long term 
follow up safety and efficacy study FKB327-003. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From  a  quality  perspective,  discrepancies  were  seen  between  the  N-glycan  patterns  of  Hulio  and 
EU-approved  Humira,  including  differences  in  high  mannose  content,  a  quality  attribute  which  was 
formerly  reported  to  affect  pharmacokinetic  properties.  At  the  CHMP  request,  the  applicant  further 
investigated potential reasons for the observed PK differences discussing all the attributes known to have 
an impact on the PKs of mAbs (drug presentations, ethnic factors...). A special attention has been paid to 
the physicochemical and functional characteristics of FKB327 (glycan patterns, LMWS) and evidence has 
been  provided 
that 
the 
relative  difference 
in  high  mannose  content 
(and/or  other 
physicochemical/biological parameters) between test and reference products  has  negligible impact on 
pharmacokinetics. 
A sensitivity analysis (ANOVA) failed to show equivalence of Cmax and the truncated AUC0-360h, with 
higher values for FKB327 than for EU-Humira. However, given the parallel design, the use of an ANCOVA 
is considered more appropriate (see discussion above). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main data relevant for comparability exercise in terms of safety comes from the study FKB327-002 
and the open label extension study FKB327-003 in RA patients. The applicant has re-randomized patients 
between FKB327-002 and FKB327-003 to either FKB327 or Humira in order to address potential 
consequences of switching between the originator and the biosimilar.  
At the end of FKB327-003 Period I (Week 52 overall), the safety profiles are similar for FF and HH 
treatment sequences (although it might be slightly better for FF). There was no outstanding difference, 
and FF is comparable to HH with regard to TEAEs, treatment-related TEAEs, TESAEs, prematurely 
discontinuation due to TEAEs, prematurely discontinuation due to TESAEs, and deaths. 
For both treatment sequences, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the Infections and Infestations 
SOC (mostly nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, URTI, UTI), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(mostly RA flare), investigations (mostly Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea and nausea). 
For both treatment sequences, treatment-related TEAEs were most frequently reported in the Infections 
and Infestations SOC (bronchitis), General disorders and administration site conditions (injection site 
reaction), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (anaemia). 
The most frequently reported TESAEs were also in the Infections and Infestations SOC. Finally, Infections 
and Infestations TEAE were also the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation. TEAEs of special 
interest were similarly reported in both treatment sequences. 
In Study FKB327-003 Period I, there was no outstanding difference between patients who remained on 
Humira (H-H) compared to patients who switched to FKB327 (H-F). And, although the safety profile was 
slightly better with F-F treatment sequence compared to the others, the incidence of severe TEAEs, 
treatment-related TEAEs, TESAEs, discontinuations due to TEAEs, and treatment interruptions due to 
TEAEs was generally comparable between treatment sequences (with switch or not). Patient and event 
numbers per sequence are too low for the observed differences to be regarded as clinically relevant in the 
absence of a consistent trend. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018 
Page 134/141 
 
 
  
Overall, the immunogenicity profiles were comparable in terms of overall ADA incidences (and titers) and 
neutralising antibodies between the FKB327 and Humira treatment groups in RA patients up to 100 weeks 
(24 wk FKB327-002 + 76 wk end of FKB327-003). Approximatively 50-60% of the patients treated with 
FKB327 or Humira develop ADAs. The frequency of nAb positive patients was almost equivalent to the 
frequency of ADA positive patients for both products. The incidence of TEHAEs and injection site reactions 
was low and well-balanced between the 2 products. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
With regard to the ADA and Nab assays used in the study FKB327-001, no conclusion can be drawn on the 
comparability of the immunogenicity profiles of FKB327 and EU-Humira and US-Humira for the healthy 
subjects included in this study due to the uncertainties related to the numerous inconclusive samples in 
the assays. However, because the deficient ADA and NAb assays were only used in the study FKB327-001 
and because ADA or NAb  are not included as a covariate of the ANCOVA model used to conclude the 
bioequivalence between all 3 treatments in the study FKB327-001, this issue was not pursued by the 
CHMP.  
In the integrated analysis of FKB327-002 and FKB327-003, while comparing the 3 different presentations 
(vial, PFS and AI), although the safety profile was overall similar, slight differences were observed: better 
safety profile observed with AI compared to PFS safety profile which was better to vial safety profile. 
These differences may have been related to the fact that the presentations were used in series (rather 
than in parallel): the exposure to the vial presentation represents the initiation of anti-TNF therapy (for 
the first time in most patients), whereas exposure to the PFS mostly represents the continuation of the 
treatment,  and  AI  represents  long-term  maintenance  therapy.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful 
differences and caution should be applied when interpreting these data due to the relatively small number 
of events for some categories. 
The observed ADA level (50-60%) is much higher to what is established in the SmPC of Humira for the RA 
population  (5%).  This  difference  could  be  due  to  a  much  more  sensitive  assay.  Moreover,  for  both 
products, although the safety profile seems quite similar, there is a decrease of the efficacy associated 
with an increase of ADA and Nab during time.  
To complete the set of safety and immunogenicity data from study FKB327-003 CSR, the applicant has 
committed to submit the final report of the pivotal Phase 3 study FKB327-003 by 31 October 2018 (see 
RMP section). 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A single pivotal equivalence trial comparing the test and reference product is considered adequate to 
support this biosimilar application. The choice of the indication (rheumatoid arthritis), the clinical setting 
(patients not adequately controlled with methotrexate, including previous anti-TNF responders), the 
primary and key secondary endpoints (ACR20 and DAS28-CRP at week 24) and the equivalence margin 
(± 13%) are in line with the CHMP guidance and were endorsed in CHMP Scientific Advice. This clinical 
model is considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of differences between the two products. 
Whilst US-licensed Humira was used as the reference product in these 2 Phase 3 studies, the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of US-licensed and EU-approved Humira have been shown to be equivalent in the 
preceding Phase 1 study, FKB327-001. There is also now more than 10 years of post-marketing 
Assessment report  
EMA/541826/2018 
Page 135/141 
 
 
  
experience with US-licensed and EU-approved Humira which has not resulted in substantially different 
safety findings for the 2 products. Thus, the safety results relating to US-licensed Humira are considered 
to be extrapolable to EU-approved Humira. 
Supportive data are provided from the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. Comparative safety data 
between FKB327 and US-Humira were collected in RA patients in the pivotal Phase 3 studies at the 
recommended clinical dose. 
Three presentations of FKB327 were used in the clinical program (while only Humira PFS was used): vials, 
PFS (FKB327-003 Period I only) and the auto-injector (FKB327-003 Period II only). 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
From a quality and non-clinical point of view, the biological functionality parameters such as 
neutralization of soluble TNF-α induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells, induction of apoptosis in mTNF-α 
expressing cells, binding to Fcγ receptor I, IIa(R), IIa(H), IIb, IIIa(F), IIIa(V), IIIbNA1 and IIIbNA2 and 
FcRn; binding to C1q; ADCC activity and CDC activity in mTNF-α were found to be similar between 
FKB327 and the reference product Humira. The applicant has shown that the biological assays supporting 
their conclusions on biosimilarity were sufficiently sensitive.  
From a PK perspective, using ANCOVA, the 90% CIs around the ratio of geometric LSMs are well within 
the pre-specified bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for all treatment comparisons for the primary PK 
endpoints, thus PK similarity was concluded between all 3 treatments (FKB327, EU-Humira and 
US-Humira). 
Equivalence of efficacy was demonstrated through robust assessment of the ACR20 RR and DAS28-CRP 
values of FKB327 vs Humira (adalimumab) treated RA patients, which are considered clinically relevant 
endpoints. Efficacy was comparable up to one year of treatment. 
The safety profiles of FKB327 and Humira are similar (and similar to the safety profile for Humira as 
described in the Summary of Product Characteristics) without clinically important difference in safety 
between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product. 
The  CHMP  therefore  concluded  that  the  similarity  of  FKB327  and  Humira  have  been  demonstrated  in 
terms of structural and functional characteristics, PK, immunogenicity profiles, efficacy and safety. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The  selection  of  RA  as  the  indication  in  which  to  conduct  the  comparative  efficacy  clinical  studies  is 
considered  appropriate  for  the  justification  of  extrapolation  of  indications  based  on  the  fact  that  RA 
patients are a sensitive population with adalimumab exerting a good effect size, and where the efficacy 
endpoints used in RA clinical trials are validated and extensively used. In addition, the disease pathology 
and the role of TNF-α inhibition in RA are known. 
The known safety profile of adalimumab is consistent across all approved indications of Humira. 
The incidence rate of ADA against adalimumab was observed to be generally similar in studies of RA, AS, 
Ps, CD and JIA, and considering the use of immunosuppressants, with only small differences reported 
between the different populations. 
Given  the  consistent  findings  from  Hulio  development  program  and  on  the  basis  of  the  current 
understanding of the mechanisms of action of adalimumab, the data from studies of FKB327 in RA has 
been  regarded  by  the  CHMP  as  predictive  of  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  the  product  in  all  of  the 
approved indications for Humira.

In addition, given the observed similarity of FKB327 and Humira, the CHMP has concluded that the benefit 
risk profiles of FKB327 and Humira will be similar in all the indications approved for Humira. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Hulio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Hulio is favourable in the following indication: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Hulio in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
• 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response 
to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated 
with methotrexate. 
Hulio can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment 
with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Hulio in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Hulio can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the 
efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 
2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and 
older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see 
section 5.1).

Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an 
inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab 
has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in 
patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve physical 
function. 
Psoriasis 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 
4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical 
therapy and phototherapies. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) 
in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS 
therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Crohn’s disease 
Hulio is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who 
have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

Paediatric Crohn's disease 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric patients 
(from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including primary 
nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have 
contraindications for such therapies. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Hulio is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who 
have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. 
Uveitis 
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid 
sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
Paediatric Uveitis  
Hulio is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from 2 
years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in 
whom conventional therapy is inappropriate.

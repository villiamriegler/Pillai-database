Submission of the final report from study F1J-MC-
B056 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is 
a non-interventional non-imposed study aimed to 
investigate the association between duloxetine 
exposure and suicide-related behaviours and ideation 
in women with stress urinary inconsistence (SUI). 
The RMP version 12.4 has also been updated to 
reflect the study results. 
duloxetine treatment in women with stress urinary 
inconsistence (SUI) compared to women with SUI without 
duloxetine treatment has been assessed in study F1J-MC-
B056. Study B056 has several limitations but in the light of 
the results the association between the risk of suicidality 
and duloxetine treatment cannot be completely ruled out. 
Currently, the risk of suicidality is an important identified 
risk for duloxetine-containing products and adequate 
warnings concerning this risk are already included in the 
SmPC. No further changes to the product information are 
warranted. The RMP is updated to reflect the study results 
and limitations and update the pharmacovigilance plan

The changes were specific for the different products, 
according to the indications they were licensed for.  
For Ariclaim the updates included: 
Update to sections 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
remove the statement that no clinical trials have 
been conducted in paediatric population, to add the 
adverse events (AEs) ‘dysphagia’ and ‘pollakiuria’, 
and to update the description of sensory 
disturbances as requested by the CHMP further to 
the assessment of PSUR 11.  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the AE 
‘testicular pain’ and to reflect the increased reporting 
frequency of the adverse event ‘falls’.  
Update to the list of the most commonly reported 
discontinuation symptoms in Section 
4.8c:‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ to 
include the term ‘myalgia’ and update the term 
‘sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or 
electric shock-like sensations, particularly in the 
head)’ as requested by the CHMP further to the 
assessment of the cumulative review of the cases 
with “electric shock-like sensations”. 
Furthermore, the MAH used the opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the QRD template version 8.3.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.  
‘falls’ was also updated. Additionally, the MAH updated the 
list of most commonly reported discontinuation symptoms 
to include “myalgia”. The term “sensory disturbances 
(including paresthesia)” was changed to “sensory 
disturbances (including paresthesia or electric shock-like 
sensations, particularly in the head)”.  
Additionally, the data from two completed studies of 
duloxetine in paediatric patients with major depressive 
disorder were available for analysis and resulted in a

placebo-controlled clinical trial database. Sections 
4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, and 4.9 of the SPC and 
sections 2 and 4 of the PL have been amended. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Following the assessment of the third Periodic Safety 
Update Report (PSUR) the CHMP requested to the MAH to 
submit a variation to reflect the new safety information. In 
addition, the MAH also proposed some changes to the SPC 
following the review of the placebo-controlled clinical trial 
database. In this variation, the following sections have 
been updated: 
Section 4.3 - Contraindications  
Addition of contraindication with regards to the initiation of 
treatment in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 
Section 4.4. Special warning and precautions of use 
In this variation warnings have been included in this 
section: 
-to update information on extrapyramidal disorders 
-to update information on blood pressure and heart rate. 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and 
other forms of interactions 
This section was updated to state that ''Caution should be 
exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral 
anticoagulants or antiplatelets drugs due to an increased 
risk of bleeding. Furthermore, increases in INR values have 
been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
warfarin". In addition to this, the following information has 
been included: Duloxetine is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and 
Page 28/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therefore caution is advised when duloxetine is co-
administered with medicinal products predominantly 
metabolised by this route (i.e. risperidone, tricyclic 
antidepressants such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and 
imipramine).    
Section 4.6 Pregnancy and Lactation  
Section 4.6 was updated to reflect that duloxetine is very 
weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 
lactating patients. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
The following Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) have been 
included in the section 4.8: Hypertensive crisis, 
supraventricular arrhythmia mainly, atrial fibrillation, 
paresthesia, hepatic failure, trismus, mania. In addition to 
this, the MAH updated the frequency of ADRs in section 4.8

included in section 4.4 of the SPC: 
- 
to recommend caution in patients whose conditions 
could be compromised by an increased heart rate or by an 
increase in blood pressure 
Page 29/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
to update information on withdrawal syndrome 
seen on discontinuation of treatment  
- 
to update information on extrapiramidal disorders  
Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) of the SPC was also 
updated with regards to withdrawal symptoms and on the 
effects of duloxetine in Hb1Ac. In addition, the following 
ADRs have been added to section 4.8: chest pain, seizures, 
hypertension, hallucinations, akathisia, psychomotor 
restlessness. 
Section 4.5 of the SPC (Interaction with other medicinal 
products) was updated to state that "Increases in INR have 
been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with 
warfarin" and to include some examples of drugs 
metabolised by CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic range 
(such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol) in which 
case caution is advised if Cymbalta is co-administered. 
In this variation the MAH also update sections 4.6 and 5.2 
of the SPC to reflect the results of a pharmacokinetic study 
in lactating women. 
The Package Leaflet was updated to reflect the above 
changes.

The MAH has updated the SPC and PL with safety 
and 4.8 of the SPC with safety information following 
assessment of PSUR 1 and a minor addition to 
section 4.7 concerning the potential for dizziness, 
with consequential changes to the relevant sections 
of the PL. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
information following assessment of the first Periodic Safety 
Update Report (PSUR).  
During the assessment of PSUR 1, 3 cases of SIADH 
(Severe Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone secretion), 7 
cases of hyponatremia and 7 cases of blood sodium 
decreased were reported. These cases involved elderly 
patients (mean 76 years). In a number of cases risk factors 
were identified (pre-existing low level of blood sodium, 
renal failure, concomitant treatment with ACE or diuretics). 
Information has been added to section 4.4 of the SPC on 
that caution is required in patients at increased risk of 
hyponatraemia such as elderly, cirrhotic, or dehydrated 
patients or patients treated with diuretics.  
Hyponatraemia may reflect a syndrome of inappropriate 
anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). 
During the assessment of PSUR 1, 12 cases of 
gastrointestinal bleeding were reported. In a number of 
cases risk factors were identified. Nevertheless, there are a 
number of epidemiological studies showing that drugs that 
inhibit 5HT re-uptake increase the risk of bleeding, 
including gastrointestinal bleeding. Information has been 
added to section 4.4 of the SPC on that reports of 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been seen. 
As an increase in approximately 2 mmHg mean increase in 
blood pressure has been seen in patients treated with 
duloxetine, information is added to section 4.4 of the SPC 
on that duloxetine is associated with an increase in blood 
pressure in some patients. In patients with known 
Page 31/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood pressure 
monitoring is recommended as appropriate. 
Cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver 
enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and 
jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 
4.8). The pattern of liver damage was predominantly 
hepatocellular. This information was included in the SPC 
and it was recommended that duloxetine should be used 
with caution

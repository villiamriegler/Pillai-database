signs text of the SmPC has been updated. Accordingly the 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the exposure of lamivudine, possibly resulting in reduced

Co-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 
g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV daily dose) of 
lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose-dependent 
decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure 
(AUC) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine 
in adults. When possible, avoid chronic co-administration of

There is limited information available on maternal-foetal

lamivudine showed an increase in early embryonic deaths

1000 outcomes from second and third trimester exposure 
in pregnant women indicate no malformative and 
foeto/neonatal effect. Less than 1% of these women have 
been treated for HBV, whereas the majority was treated for 
HIV at higher doses and with other concomitant 
medications. Zeffix can be used during pregnancy if 
clinically needed. For patients who are being treated with 
lamivudine and subsequently become pregnant 
consideration should be given to the possibility of a 
recurrence of hepatitis on discontinuation of lamivudine.

with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) receiving 
lamivudine showed no effect from cladribine until 
lamivudine was discontinued.  
The authors suspected a potential interaction based on 
intracellular phosphorylation of the two medicines and an in 
vitro study was carried out using peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells isolated from a healthy volunteer. This in 
vitro study showed that phosphorylated cladribine levels 
were decreased with increasing lamivudine concentrations, 
in line with what expected as per cladribine Product 
Information. 
While the robustness of the findings and their clinical 
relevance remain unclear (this concomitant use in clinical 
practice is likely to be very rare, a literature research only 
retrieved this single case report, and no other 
haematological parameters as red blood cells or platelets 
count were evaluated) the potential for this drug interaction 
supported by the in vitro study justifies updating the

A 5-year open off-treatment epidemiologic study was 
increase the continuation of therapy from HbeAg 
seroconversion from 3 months to at least 3-6 months 
and to include a wording relating to the rate of late 
virological relapses, as requested by the CHMP in 
August 2006. This follows the assessment of an 
epidemiological clinical study over five years in 
patents with or without YMDD mutants together with 
a comparative literature review. 
performed to provide data on the durability of post-
treatment responses. The final results of this study show 
that late virological relapses occur in 39% of HBeAg+ve 
patients who seroconverted post lamivudine treatment. 
These results together with data from a comprehensive 
literature review performed by the MAH indicate that the 
HBeAg seroconversion is not sufficient to ensure that a 
sustained response could be obtained and section 5.1 of

the SPC was revised to include this information. 
Furthermore, according to data from a literature review and 
in line with the current international treatment guidelines, 
section 4.2 of the SPC was amended to allow continuation 
of treatment with Zeffix for at least 3-6 months from 
HBeAg seroconversion instead of the currently 
recommended duration of 3 months.

Exacerbations of hepatitis 
tablets and oral solution to re-organise information 
II, Labelling 
During the year covered by PSUR n. 17 (from 1 August 
on exacerbation of hepatitis as requested by CHMP 
and PL 
2004 to 31 July 2005), four fatal cases with hepatic events 
following the evaluation of PSUR 17 covering the 
period from 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2005. 
Additionally the MAH proposed to update section 4.8 
of the SPC to introduce rhabdomyolysis as a very 
rare side effect. The PL was updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH updated the product 
occurring after lamivudine withdrawal were recorded. 
Severe post-treatment flares, which can be fatal are 
recognised to occur following withdrawal of lamivudine and 
such events are currently described in section 4.4 "Special 
warnings and precautions for use" of the SPC. Given the 
importance of this information, the CHMP concluded that

section 4.4 of the SPC should be re-organized so as to have 
a sub-title "exacerbation of hepatitis" reflecting the 
possibility of per-treatment and post-treatment 
exacerbation of hepatitis whether or not associated with 
viral resistance. Furthermore, such serious adverse events 
so far not listed in section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the 
SPC have been added. 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Following the assessment of PSUR n. 17, and given the 
medical seriousness of rhabdomyolysis (can induce serious 
and life threatening renal damage), a cumulative review of 
available data was considered warranted and was provided 
by the MAH. Therefore, rhabdomyolysis has been added as 
a very rare adverse reaction in section 4.8 under the 
heading of "Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders" of the SPC.

I. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1.1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Protopic  is  a  topical  formulation  of  tacrolimus,  an  immunosuppressant,  used  for  the  treatment  of 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of 
conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. The 0,03% formulation is also indicated for the 
treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children (2 years of age and above) who failed to 
respond adequately to conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids.  
Protopic was authorised by the centralised procedure (EU/1/02/201) on 28 February 2002. 
In this Type II variation the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied to extend the indication 
to  include  maintenance  treatment.  In  support  of  this  indication  the  MAH  submitted  the  results  from 
two  clinical  trials  (study  FG-506-06-40  and  FG-506-06-41)  and  three  non-clinical  studies  (1 
pharmacokinetic and 2 carcinogenicity). 
1.2  NON CLINICAL ASPECTS 
The MAH provided an addendum to Module 2.4 ‘Nonclinical Overview’ submitted with the renewal 
application  in  May  2006.  This  addendum  reflected  the  results  from  three  additional  studies  (1 
pharmacokinetic  and  2  carcinogenicity)  that  were  performed  after  the  renewal  application  and 
presented the data in the context of the new indication of maintenance therapy filed with this Type II 
variation application. In addition to the addendum the MAH  submitted the full study reports for the 
three studies.  
1.2.1  Pharmacokinetic 
1.2.1.1  A Whole Blood and Tissue Pharmacokinetics Study of FK506 Following Twice-Daily 
Topical Application of 0.1% Tacrolimus Ointment to Male Yucatan Minipig Swine for 
14 Days 
Whole  blood  and  lymphoid  tissue  concentrations  of  tacrolimus  were  determined  following  topical 
administration of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment to male Yucatan minipigs for up to 14 days followed by 2 
weeks of recovery. Tacrolimus was applied topically (2 mg/cm2 where individual doses ranged from 
~0.1  to  0.2mg/kg)  twice  daily  approximately  12  hours  apart,  for  up  to  13  consecutive  days  to 
approximately 20% of the total body surface area for each animal in 8 groups (n=5). A control group 
of  5  minipigs  were  sham  dosed  and  subject  to  blood  sampling  procedures  only.  Necropsies  were 
carried out on Days 1, 7, 10, 14, 15, 17, 21 and 28 (Groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively) and 
were performed approximately 12 hours after first daily dose on days 1, 7, 10 and 14. Blood samples 
were  also  taken  prior  to  necropsy.  Prescapular,  subiliac,  popliteal  and  mesenteric  analyses  were 
performed following necropsy.  
Mean concentrations of tacrolimus were generally higher in spleen, thymus and lymph nodes than in 
whole  blood.  After  repeat  dosing,  mean  concentrations  were  generally  higher  indicating  possible 
accumulation  in  tissue.  Elimination  of  tacrolimus  was  gradual  from  all  tissue  with  no  detectable 
presence of the drug in blood by day 21. Tacrolimus was still present in the lymph nodes on day 28. 
The tacrolimus blood levels in humans following topical application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment are 
essentially the same as those found in mini and micropigs (see Table 1).

Table 1: 
FK506 Blood Levels in Minipigs, Micropigs, Mice and Humans Following Topical 
Application of 0.1% Tacrolimus Ointment 
The  CHMP  commented  that  the  highest  concentrations  of  tacrolimus  were  observed  in  the  draining 
lymph nodes (precapsular) at the site of application, followed by remote skin-draining lymph nodes, 
remote  visceral  lymph  nodes,  thymus  and  finally  spleen.  Tacrolimus  was  still  present  in  the  lymph 
nodes  on  day  28.  It  was  considered  that  minipig  is  a  relevant  model  for  human  safety  given  the 
similarity of tacrolimus blood levels. 
1.2.2  Toxicology 
Two  carcinogenicity  studies  were  undertaken  to  assess  the  effect  of  0.1%  tacrolimus  ointment  on 
papilloma formation in a two step carcinogenesis mouse model and to assess the effects on Cutaneous 
T Cell Lymphoma. 
1.2.2.1  Investigation  on  Co-promoting  Potential  of  Protopic  Ointment  in  a  Two-stage  Skin 
Carcinogenesis Model using Mice. 
CD-1(ICR) female mice were treated once daily with 0.1% or 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus 
ointment  vehicle,  absorptive  ointment  or  macrogol  ointment.  Tumour  promotion  was  induced  with 
twice  a  week  treatment  of  TPA  (5  nM)  for  18  weeks  starting  from  2  weeks  after  50  μg  of  DMBA 
initiation.  The  numbers  of  skin  nodules  were  counted  over  time  and  were  histopathologically 
examined  at  20  weeks  after  initiation  by  DMBA.  A  sham  group  received  the  same  procedures  to 
mimic the ones carried out in the test group. The results from this study are presented in table 2 below.

1.2.2.2  Tacrolimus Effects on Cutaneous T Cell lymphoma, Lymphocyte and Dendritic Cells 
The  effects  of  tacrolimus  (0.01,  0.1,  1,  10,  50,  100  ng/ml)  were  examined  on  proliferation,  cell 
recovery and viability of cultured cutaneous T cell lymphoma lymphocytes (CTCL) and dendritic cell 
(DC) from patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The results are presented in table 3, 4 and 5.

Table 5: 
CTCL Cell Viability 
Tacrolimus  was  found  to  maintain  CTLC  cell  proliferation  and  cell  recovery  at  0.1  to  10  ng/ml  but 
was inhibitory at >10 ng/ml. Additionally tacrolimus severely reduced the CTCL viability at 50 and 
100 ng/ml. The viability and recovery of CTCL cells and DCs exposed to tacrolimus were similarly 
affected.  The  MAH  concluded  that  tacrolimus  tended  to  maintain  CTCL  cell  proliferation  and  cell 
recovery  at  0.1  and  10  ng/ml  but  was  inhibitory  at  >10ng/ml.  Overall,  the  MAH  concluded  that 
tacrolimus may inhibit the development of cutaneous lymphoma at 10 ng/ml or higher, while having 
little influence on it at concentrations less then 10 ng/ml. 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  overall  MAH  conclusion,  that  tacrolimus  may  inhibit  the 
development of cutaneous lymphoma at 10 ng/ml, was not substantiated. While tacrolimus was found 
to  inhibit  CTLC  cell  proliferation  and  cell  recovery  at  concentrations  >10  ng/ml,  cell  viability  was 
severely  reduced  in  all  cases,  especially  at  the  100  ng/ml  dose.  Additionally,  the  large  variability 
between the experiments influences the ability to draw clear conclusions on the effect of tacrolimus on 
the  development  of  cutaneous  lymphoma.  Moreover,  no  statistical  analysis  was  performed  for  this 
experiment so the significance of the results is unclear. 
So, while tacrolimus was found to inhibit CTLC cell proliferation and cell recovery at concentrations 
>10 ng/ml, cell viability was severely reduced in all cases, especially at the 100 ng/ml dose. The MAH 
was therefore asked to comment on the significance of these results and to what extent the reduction in 
proliferation rates merely reflects overall cell death at higher concentrations. 
The MAH responded that the co-culture of CTCL cells and DC in the presence of FK506 (the Berger 
technique) as described previously suggests that FK506 is inhibitory to CTCL cells at concentrations 
of FK506 >10 ng/mL. The MAH acknowledged that the cell culture data obtained from this technique 
is  not  confirmatory  for  the  effects  of  FK506  in  skin  during  the  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment  in  the 
topical treatment of AD. It does, however, suggest that topical FK506 in humans could have inhibitory 
effects on CTCL in skin, depending on the prevailing concentration of FK506 in skin. The culture data 
from the study indicates that this is most likely at a FK506 concentration of 100 ng/mL; however, it is 
not possible to indicate with certainty whether the cytotoxicity observed with the Berger technique at 
100  ng/mL  is  an  indication  of  general  cell  death  or  in  any  way  specific  to  CTCL.  Published 
information indicates that CTCL cells originate in skin and not in the systemic circulation (Berger et al 
2002). The available data also suggests that the FK506 concentrations in human skin following topical 
application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment cover the range from 200-800 ng/g. As with the data from the 
Berger  technique,  neither  of  these  articles  is  confirmatory  for  these  observations,  but  on  the  other 
hand,  there  is  some  reason  to  believe  that  CTCL  proliferation  in  skin  of  humans  being  treated  with 
tacrolimus ointment for AD may be inhibited. In the final analysis, there is no evidence for enhanced 
CTCL cell proliferation at high doses of tacrolimus in vitro. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  suggestion  by  the  MAH  that  topical  FK506  in  humans  could  have 
inhibitory effects on CTCL in skin depending on the prevailing concentration of FK506 in skin and 
that the concentration seen in this study (100 ng/ml) would substantiate this theory. While tacrolimus 
was  found  to  inhibit  CTLC  cell  proliferation  and  cell  recovery  at  concentrations  >10  ng/ml,  cell 
viability  was  severely  reduced  in  all  cases,  especially  at  the  100  ng/ml  dose  which  would  in  turn 
influences the ability to draw any conclusion as to the effect of tacrolimus on CTCL cell proliferation.

1.3   CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Clinical Efficacy 
The MAH conducted 2 studies (i.e. the CONTROL studies) with identical study designs.  
Studies  FG506-06-40  (in  adults,  ≥ 16  years  old)  and  FG506-06-41  (in  children,  2  to  15  years  old) 
were Phase III, multicentre, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies. The objective of 
both  studies  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a  tacrolimus  ointment  regimen  to  a  vehicle-
based regimen administered to control atopic dermatitis over a period of 12 months. The design of the 
studies was basically as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
A screening period of up to 1 week 
An  open  label  period  (OLP)  in  which  patients  received  treatment  with  twice  daily  tacrolimus 
ointment  (0.1%  for  adults,  0.03%  for  children)  for  a  maximum  of  6 weeks.  Patients  were 
withdrawn from the study if they did not respond to treatment by the end of the OLP (response 
defined as Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] ≤ 2, i.e. clear, almost clear or mild disease). 
The purpose of the OLP was to allow stabilisation of the disease, so that patients would enter the 
disease control period (DCP) in a relatively symptom-free condition at baseline. 
A subsequent randomised double-blind disease control period (DCP) of 12 months. During the 
DCP  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  twice  weekly  treatment  with  either  vehicle  or 
tacrolimus ointment. Both treatment groups received twice daily tacrolimus ointment at times of 
disease exacerbations during the DCP. For the purpose of this document, the efficacy results are 
presented for the DCP only.  
A duration of 12 months was selected for the DCP because this would, according to the MAH, 
allow an assessment of prevention of flares over a period of time during which relapse would be 
expected  to  occur  on  a  regular  basis.  Thus,  the  frequency  of  relapses  could  be  measured,  in 
addition to the time to first relapse, to assess the utility of long-term maintenance therapy.

consisting of a screening period of up to 
1 week, an open label period (OLP) for a 
maximum of 6 weeks for atopic dermatitis

patients were randomised to receive twice-
weekly treatment with either vehicle or 
tacrolimus ointment. Both treatment groups 
received twice-daily tacrolimus ointment at 
times of disease exacerbation during the 
DCP.

Tacrolimus ointment concentration chosen for the CONTROL studies 
Based on Phase II dose-response studies in adults and children it has been established that the optimal 
concentrations  of  tacrolimus  ointment  for  treatment  of  atopic  dermatitis  (AD)  are  0.03%  and  0.1%. 
Both  concentrations  are  approved  for  the  second-line  treatment  of  AD  in  adults,  whereas  only  the 
lower 0.03% strength is approved for second-line treatment in children. In line with the current SPC, 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  approved  strengths  of  tacrolimus  ointment  -  0.03%  for  children  (2-15  years  old)  and  0.1%  for 
adults (≥ 16 years old) were used in the CONTROL studies FG-506-06-40 and FG-506-06-41. 
Overall, the design of both trials was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CONTROL trials did 
not examine both tacrolimus ointment i.e. 0.03% and 0.1% doses in adults for maintenance treatment, 
i.e.  the  lower  dose  0.03%  was  not  examined  in  adults  for  maintenance  treatment.  While  it  was 
considered acceptable that the MAH is not seeking an indication in adults for the lower dose the MAH 
was  asked  to  provide  justification  as  to  why  the  0.03%  strength  was  not  studied  in  adults  as  a 
maintenance treatment.  
The MAH replied that they had decided to investigate a regimen aiming to prevent or at least delay 
exacerbations  of  the  disease  following  the  acute  treatment  of  an  existing  flare,  in  the  context  of  the 
post- marketing development phase of Protopic ointment. 
In  the  case  of  the  ointment  strength  to  be  studied  in  adult  patients,  tacrolimus    0.1%  ointment  had 
shown  in  pivotal  efficacy  studies  to  be  more  effective  than  the  0.03%  strength  in  patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  atopic  dermatitis,  while  retaining  an  acceptable  safety  profile.  The  design  of  the 
maintenance study in adult patients included all disease severities (mild, moderate and severe atopic 
dermatitis)  and  therefore  it  was  considered  that  two  thirds  of  the  total  target  population  were  more 
likely  to  have  a  greater  benefit  from  treatment  with  the  higher  strength.  With  the  most  common 
drawback  likely  to  be  a  higher  incidence  of  episodes  of  skin  irritation.  In  this  context,  the  potential 
benefits of using tacrolimus  0.1% ointment for maintenance treatment were considered to exceed the 
risk  for  increased  skin  irritation.  An  additional  consideration  was  that  adults  with  atopic  dermatitis 
may have their disease for many years, perhaps even decades, and are known to require more potent 
therapies  to  keep  their  chronic  disease  under  control.  Previous  studies  to  treat  acute  flares  had 
confirmed this, making the 0.1% strength more suitable for the conduct of a study aiming at long term 
disease control in adults. 
Prescription data collected by the MAH supports a posteriori that the choice made for the study was 
consistent with the prescription pattern of physicians using Protopic in adult patients. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH response. 
Frequency of application chosen for the CONTROL studies 
The  selection  of  once  a  day,  twice-weekly  application  of  tacrolimus  ointment  for  the  CONTROL 
studies FG-506-06-40 and FG-506-06-41 was based on pharmacokinetic considerations supported by 
evidence from clinical practice. 
Pharmacokinetic considerations: 
Following topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the target 
tissue – the skin compartment. For disease control, presence of tacrolimus in the skin is pre-requisite. 
The half-life of tacrolimus after topical application is approximately 3 days and is reflective of a slow 
elimination  of  tacrolimus  from  the  skin  compartment.  Percutaneous  absorption  of  tacrolimus  into 
healthy  skin  is  lower  than  into  diseased  skin.  Thus,  the  application  frequency  which  reflects  the 
apparent  absorption  half-life,  i.e.  approximately  every  3  days  is  expected  to  maintain  sufficient 
concentration  of  tacrolimus  in  the  skin  for  the  control  of  the  disease.  Therefore,  once  a  day,  twice-
weekly application was used in the studies. 
Evidence from clinical practice: 
A  retrospective  analysis  indicated  that  long-term  intermittent  treatment  with  tacrolimus  ointment  in 
patients with moderate to severe AD may reduce the risk of AD relapse (Alomar et al. 2004). This has 
led  some  dermatologists  to  develop  a  flare  control  strategy  for  selected  patients.  On  a  case  by  case 
basis,  it  has  been  shown  that  some  patients  can  suffice  with  once  weekly  treatment,  whereas  others 
may  require  up  to  three  times  weekly  application  to  control  their  disease.  During  protocol 
development,  the  twice  per  week  application  scheme  was  a  consensus  choice  made  after  extensive 
discussion  with  a  panel  of  medical  experts.  The  MAH  did  not  discuss  any  other  potential  treatment 
regimens. However, choice of treatment frequency was justified based on the application frequency, 
which  reflects  the  apparent  absorption  half-life.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  application  approximately 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
every 3 days is expected to provide a sufficient concentration of tacrolimus in the skin for the control 
of the disease. Therefore, once a day, twice-weekly application was considered acceptable.  
Patient population 
Selection  criteria  for  the  CONTROL  studies  FG-506-06-40  (adult  patients  ≥  16  years  old)  and  FG-
506-06-41 (paediatric patients, 2-15 years old) were consistent with the pivotal trials for treatment of 
AD, except that the CONTROL studies enrolled patients with mild to severe AD and the pivotal trials 
enrolled patients with moderate to severe AD. In all trials the severity of AD was graded according to 
the criteria of Rajka and Langeland (Rajka and Langeland, 1989).  
Mild AD was included in the selection criteria of the CONTROL studies, because it was anticipated at 
the time of study design to expand the indication of tacrolimus ointment to include these patients. It 
was later decided to continue with only moderate to severe AD for twice-daily treatment of AD flares 
and  also  for  the  once  a  day,  twice-weekly  maintenance  regimen.  Thus,  additional  analyses  which 
included the subpopulation of patients with moderate and severe AD were conducted for all endpoints 
used in both CONTROL studies. The statistical analyses based on the subpopulation of moderate and 
severe  patients  were  performed  retrospectively.  However,  given  the  high  level  of  statistical 
significance observed in the analyses of the key endpoints for both the total trial population and the 
moderate to severe subset, the post hoc nature of the subset analyses was not considered by the MAH 
to raise any concerns for their interpretation. 
The CHMP understood why patients with mild AD were included as it was anticipated that the SPC 
would be expanded for the treatment of mild AD. However, the CHMP requested the MAH to explain 
how the removal of patients with mild AD from the results of the CONTROL studies FG-506-06-40 
and FG-506-06-41 affected the power of the study in its ability to detect any differences between the 
treatment regimens. The MAH was also asked to comment on whether post hoc analysis affected the 
analysis of the results in any significant way. 
The  MAH  responded  and  explained  that  for  studies  FG-506-06-40  and  FG-506-06-41,  sample  size 
calculation determined that 200 patients (100 per arm) with at least 50 patients in each disease severity 
stratum would be required. It was assumed that 30% of patients in the vehicle arm would experience 
no exacerbation, and the MAH aimed to detect a 25% difference in the exacerbation-free rate between 
the  tacrolimus  arm  and  the  vehicle  arm.  It  was  further  supposed  that,  of  the  patients  who  would 
experience a flare, the proportions experiencing 1, 2, 3 and > 4 flares would be uniformly distributed 
(a conservative approach). Under these assumptions, to power the study at 90%, to detect a difference 
between the treatment arms with a two-sided significance level of 5%, approximately 100 patients per 
arm were required. In summary, under either the protocol assumptions or the observed results the post-
hoc power was considered high. Given the high level of statistical significance (p< 0.001) observed in 
the  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  (and  several  key  secondary  endpoints)  for  both  the  total  study 
population  and  the  combined  moderate  to  severe  subpopulation  in  both  studies,  the  MAH  did  not 
consider  that  the  post  hoc  nature  of  the  subpopulation  analyses  raises  any  concerns  for  their 
interpretation.  
The CHMP agreed with the MAH response.  
Study FG506-06-40 (adult patients ≥ 16 years old) 
A considerably lower percentage of patients in the tacrolimus ointment group than in the vehicle group 
discontinued  treatment  during  the  DCP.  Lack  of  efficacy  and  withdrawal  of  consent  were  the  most 
common  reasons  for  discontinuation  during  the  DCP.  Few  patients  (0  patients  in  the  tacrolimus 
ointment  group  versus  5  patients  in  the  vehicle  group)  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  (AE).  
Patient disposition for the moderate to severe AD subset was consistent with the main findings (FAS, 
DCP). Treatment groups were well balanced with regard to demographic and baseline characteristics, 
for the total population as well as for the moderate to severe subset.

Patients  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  stayed  on  average  longer  in  the  DCP  compared  with  the 
vehicle  group  (292.1 days  versus  226.5  days).  The  mean  percentage  of  treatment  days  for  disease 
exacerbations during the DCP was lower between the treatment groups and was seen across all strata.

As  expected  there  were  higher  numbers  of  subjects  leaving  the  vehicle  arm  of  the  study  as  time 
progressed in the clinical trial. The MAH was requested by the CHMP to confirm whether any cases 
of  withdrawal  of  consent  were  patients  who  experienced  adverse  events.  In  response,  the  MAH 
provided  details  of  withdrawals  for  consent  for  both  studies  (adults  and  children)  during  the  open 
labelled period and disease control period (see table 8 below).  
Table 8: 
Adverse  Event  Related  Withdrawals  of  Consent  in  Studies  FG-506-06-40  (Adult)  and  
FG 506-06-41 (Pediatric) 
Overall, very few patients withdrew consent due to AEs in the OLP, all of them were adults. In the 
DCP the number of patients who withdrew consent due to AEs in the tacrolimus arm was lower than 
in  the  vehicle  arm.  However,  this  difference  was  driven  by  the  increased  numbers  withdrawing 
consent  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  vehicle  arm.  The  AEs  reported  are  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of tacrolimus ointment. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  level  of  patients  withdrawing  consent  was  higher  in  the  vehicle 
treatment  group  than  in  the  maintenance  group.  The  additional  data  did  not  highlight  any  additional 
safety concerns. 
The  percentage  of  overall  days  in  treatment  for  a  disease  exacerbation  were  lower  for  the  moderate 
and  severe  groups  of  AD  receiving  maintenance  treatment  then  for  all  patients  (ITT)  and  for  the 
completers  (PP).  Of  the  completers,  the  severe  AD  group  appeared  to  have  considerably  lower 
percentage of days in exacerbation than placebo and the relative magnitude was greater for severe AD 
than for moderate AD. The effect of maintenance treatment relative to vehicle appears to be greater for 
severe  AD  versus  moderate  AD  patients  (for  both  the  ITT  and  PP  population).  Based  on  this  the 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  comment  on  the  differences  in  efficacy  seen  between  moderate  and 
severe AD patients, both in the adult and the paediatric patients.   
The MAH responded that the percentage of days in disease exacerbation was one of the key secondary 
endpoints directly related to the assessment of flares. The MAH acknowledged that in the adult study 
the severe patients appeared to have a higher beneficial effect than the moderate patients and yet in the 
paediatric study the opposite effect was observed. However, the studies were not designed to provide 
precise  treatment  effects  within  each  stratum  and,  though  there  was  some  variation  in  the  observed 
treatment  benefits  among  the  severity  subgroups,  the  results  were  consistently  in  favour  of  the 
tacrolimus arm. 
For adult patients, a significant clinical advantage of the tacrolimus arm over the vehicle arm for the 
studied  population  (mild  to  severe  patients)  has  been  demonstrated  and  is  maintained  for  the  target 
sub-population (moderate to severe patients) (Table 9). 
Table 9: 
Treatment Effect (Percentage of Days) and P-Values for Within Strata Comparisons Study 
FG-506-06-40 (Adults) 
For  adults  the  benefit  was  statistically  significant in  all  cases  (p<  0.001).  Looking  at  the  size  of  the 
observed  treatment  effects  in  the  study,  both  the  mean  and  median  differences  were  greater  for  the 
severe stratum than the moderate stratum. However, the 95% confidence intervals around the median 
differences show considerable overlap in the plausible range for the treatment effect. 
As  for  adult  patients,  the  paediatric  study  showed  clinical  advantage  of  the  tacrolimus  arm  over  the 
vehicle  arm  for  the  population  defined  upfront  (mild  to  severe  patients)  and  the  effect  is  consistent 
when looking at the subgroup of moderate to severe patients and also within the subgroups of patients 
with  moderate  and  severe  AD  respectively.  This  advantage  was  statistically  significant  within  the 
moderate stratum but did not reach statistical significance within the severe stratum (Table 10). 
Table 10: 
Treatment Effect (Percentage of Days) and P-Values for Within Strata Comparisons Study 
FG-506-06-41 (Pediatric) 
The  MAH  highlighted  that  the  results  obtained  based  on  the  breakdown  of  data  by  strata  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution.  They  cannot  be  fully  substantiated  as  the  study  was  not  powered  for  these 
within-stratum analyses, and the patient numbers within individual strata are quite small. A factor that 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may have contributed to the findings is the less chronic disease status (shorter history of disease) in 
children when compared to adult patients, influencing responses to treatment. 
When looking at the population with the highest perceived  medical need (moderate to  severe atopic 
dermatitis),  the  study  reached  its  objective  to  show  a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  flares 
requiring  substantial  therapeutic  intervention.  The  MAH  further  clarified  that  this  is  an  additional 
treatment  option  that  may  benefit  patients  and  is  not  a  replacement  for  any  current  therapeutic 
regimen. Starting a maintenance therapy regimen should be at the discretion of the treating physician 
and  information  about  the  maintenance  therapy  option  should  be  made  available  to  patients  in  all 
subpopulations. 
Tacrolimus ointment use 
Table  11  below  summarizes  average  tacrolimus  ointment  use  per  day.  For  the  tacrolimus  ointment 
group this combined double-blind DCP treatment and open-label disease exacerbation treatment. For 
the vehicle group, this was only open-label treatment for disease exacerbations.

Source: Report FG506-06-40-R-CR-1, Table 13.2.3.19; Moderate to severe subset, Table 13.4.3.19 
Because of the widely scattered and skewed data distribution the data on tacrolimus ointment use are 
difficult  to  interpret.  However,  for  the  moderate  to  severe  subset  the  application  of  tacrolimus 
ointment once daily, twice per week as maintenance treatment did not lead to an increase in the total 
average  per  day  tacrolimus  ointment  use  compared  with  the  vehicle  group  when  both  maintenance 
treatment  and  disease  exacerbation  treatment  were  combined.  The  MAH  pooled  the  results  for 
moderate  and  severe  AD  groups  and  concluded  that  an  increased  use  of  tacrolimus  as  maintenance 
compared  with  the  vehicle  group  was  not  observed.  However,  the  difference  between  the  treatment 
groups and the vehicle group is modest for the moderate group and there is a real difference seen for 
less daily average use in the severe group.  
Results 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint in study FG506-06-40 was the number of disease exacerbations that required a 
substantial therapeutic intervention adjusted for time in the disease control period. Findings from this 
analysis are summarized in the table 12 below.

Substantial therapeutic intervention is defined as a disease exacerbation lasting greater than 7 days and an IGA of 3-5 at DE 
day1 
Adjusted  for  the  length  of  time  in  the  DCP,  the  number  of  disease  exacerbations  that  required  a 
substantial therapeutic intervention was significantly lower in the tacrolimus group than in the vehicle 
group for both the main analysis of patients with mild to severe AD and the moderate to severe subset 
(both analyses: p < 0.001, 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). 
In  the  main  analysis  of  all  patients  with  mild  to  severe  AD,  the  median  number  of  disease 
exacerbations was lower in the tacrolimus ointment group (0.0, N=116) than in the vehicle group (3.0, 
N=108).  Consistent  findings  were  shown  for  the  moderate  to  severe  subset,  for  which  the  median 
number of disease exacerbations was also lower in the tacrolimus ointment group (1.0, N=80) than in 
the vehicle group (5.3, N=73).  
In relation to the primary endpoint the CHMP agreed with the MAH that there are numerically more 
patients  not  experiencing  any  flare  in  the  0.1%  Tacrolimus  treatment  group  compared  with  vehicle 
(48.8%  versus  17.8%  in  moderate  to  severe  AD).  With  maintenance  tacrolimus  treatment,  fewer 
patients  experienced  5  or  more  disease  exacerbations  than  vehicle.  However  there  are  more  patients 
experiencing disease exacerbations (DE) with a frequency of 1 to 4 in the 0.1% tacrolimus arm when 
compared with placebo. Overall, there is a shift toward fewer or no exacerbations with maintenance 
treatment compared with vehicle.

For the total study population the estimated rate of patients without any disease exacerbation requiring 
a  substantial  therapeutic  intervention  was  higher  in  the  tacrolimus  group  than  in  the  vehicle  group 
throughout the study (p < 0.001, Log rank test). At Month 12, the disease exacerbation-free rate was 
52.0% (tacrolimus ointment group) compared with 16.8% for vehicle. Similarly a statistical significant 
difference in favour of tacrolimus is observed in the moderate to severe AD stratum (p < 0.001, Log 
rank  test);  the  estimated  rate  of  patients  without  any  disease  exacerbations  at  12-month  was  44.3% 
(tacrolimus ointment) compared with 9.8% for vehicle.

Kaplan  Meier  Curve:  Time  to  first  Disease  Exacerbation  Requiring  a  Substantial  Therapeutic 
Intervention in Study FG506-06-40 (Moderate to severe Subset, FAS) 
For  the  moderate  to  severe  subset,  the  median  number  of  disease  exacerbations  was  1.0  (tacrolimus 
ointment) versus 6.8 (vehicle), and the estimated DE-free rates at 12 months were 37.8% (tacrolimus 
ointment) versus 9.3% (vehicle). 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  proportion  of  patients  without  disease  exacerbation  that 
required  a  substantial  therapeutic  intervention  during  disease  control  period  was  in  favour  of 
maintenance  treatment  versus  vehicle.  It  was  also  noted  that  although  patients  receiving  tacrolimus 
ointment as maintenance had fewer exacerbations the average number of patients at risk (of a disease 
exacerbation) was higher in the tacrolimus ointment group than in the vehicle arm. 
The  moderate  to  severe  AD  subset,  post-baseline  mEASI  values,  Eczema  Area  and  Severity  Index 
(EASI) and post-baseline values of affected BSA were consistently lower for the tacrolimus ointment 
group than for the vehicle group during the DCP (see tables 14 and 15 below for detailed listings).

Study FG506-06-41 (Paediatric patients 2-15 years old) 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a  tacrolimus  ointment  0.03% 
regimen to a vehicle-based regimen administered to control AD in paediatric patients over a period of 
12 months. 
Regarding patient disposition, a lower percentage of patients in the tacrolimus ointment group (24.0%, 
30/125) than in the vehicle group (34.4%, 43/125) discontinued treatment during the DCP. The most 
common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, IGA > 2 at end of OLP and lack of 
efficacy. The CHMP considered that the treatment groups were generally well balanced with regard to 
demographic and baseline characteristics.  
In the table on study drug exposure (Table 18) for all patients, the moderate to severe AD groups of 
patients receiving tacrolimus maintenance treatment were noted to have a longer duration in the DCP 
compared with the vehicle group. The moderate to severe AD group receiving maintenance tacrolimus 
ointment,  recorded  fewer  days  of  open-label  treatment  for  disease  exacerbations  compared  with  the 
vehicle  group  as  the  percentage  of  days  of  treatment  for  disease  exacerbations  are  lower  in  the 
maintenance group versus placebo.

On review of the percentage of days of treatment for disease exacerbation during the disease control 
period  for  all  patients  in  a  moderate  AD  category,  the  CHMP  observed  a  significant  difference 
between the maintenance tacrolimus phase and the vehicle arm. This effect was considerably less for 
the severe AD groups. This effect was also seen in the patients who completed the study. The number 
of  patients  were  however  low  and  the  results  are  recorded  with  wide  standard  deviations  so  it  was 
considered difficult to draw any firm conclusions. 
The  MAH  concluded  in  their  application  that  ‘However,  for  the  moderate  to  severe  subset  the 
application of tacrolimus ointment once daily, twice per week as maintenance treatment did not lead to 
an  increase  in  the  total  average  per  day  tacrolimus  ointment  use  compared  with  the  vehicle  group, 
when both maintenance treatment and disease exacerbation treatment were combined.’ 
Although this is true, the moderate group have an increased use of tacrolimus ointment use. Only the 
severe group have less average daily use of tacrolimus. As the amount used is a sum of maintenance 
and  disease  exacerbation  use  the  Committee  concluded  that  the  severe  group  had  less  numbers  of 
disease exacerbation then the vehicle severe group, where as this benefit is not seen for the moderate 
AD  group.  Therefore,  the  lower  incidence  of  disease  exacerbations  seen  in  moderate  AD  using 
tacrolimus maintenance treatment might be at the expense of increased tacrolimus use.

Adjusted  for  the  length  of  time  in  the  DCP,  the  number  of  disease  exacerbations  that  required  a 
substantial therapeutic intervention was significantly lower in the tacrolimus group than in the vehicle 
group for the main analysis of patients with moderate to severe subset. 
Consistent findings were shown for the moderate to severe AD stratum, for which the median number 
of  disease  exacerbations  was  also  lower  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  (1.0, N=78)  than  in  the 
vehicle group (2.9, N=75). 
While  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  tacrolimus  0.03%  treatment  arm  had  fewer  numbers  of 
disease exacerbations, the benefit was not seen in all frequencies. However, the overall results show a 
shift  toward  none  or  fewer  disease  exacerbations  with  tacrolimus  treatment  compared  to  placebo 
treatment.

For the moderate to severe subset, the results were similar to the analysis of the total study population: 
the  estimated  rate  of  patients  without  disease  exacerbation  requiring  a  substantial  therapeutic 
intervention  was  significantly  higher  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  than  in  the  vehicle  group 
throughout  the  DCP  (p  <  0.001,  Log  rank  test).  The  12-month  disease  exacerbation-free  rate  was 
42.9%  (tacrolimus  ointment)  versus  17.7%  (vehicle).  The  median  time  to  first  disease  exacerbation 
requiring a substantial therapeutic intervention was 217 days in tacrolimus ointment group and 36 days 
in the vehicle group.  
The  analyses  of  frequency  and  time  to  first  disease  exacerbation  including  those  not  requiring  a 
substantial therapeutic intervention were significantly in favour of tacrolimus ointment versus vehicle. 
For  the  moderate  to  severe  subset,  the  median  number  of  disease  exacerbations  was  1.5  (tacrolimus 
ointment) versus 3.5 (vehicle) and the estimated DE-free rates at 12 months were 37.6% (tacrolimus 
ointment)  versus  11.8%  (vehicle).  The  median  time  to  first  DE  was  146  days  (tacrolimus  ointment) 
and 17 days (vehicle). 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  MAH  conclusion  as  by  patients  without  a  disease  exacerbation  that 
required  a  substantial  therapeutic  intervention  during  disease  control  period  was  found  in  favour  of 
tacrolimus  maintenance  treatment. The  median  time  to  first  DE  was  146  days  (tacrolimus  ointment) 
and 17 days (vehicle). The median number of disease exacerbations was 1.5 versus 3.5 for tacrolimus 
ointment maintenance versus vehicle. 
Secondary  endpoints  mEASI,  EASI,  affected  BSA  and  IGA  were  found  to  be  in  favour  of 
maintenance treatment versus vehicle in adults however the same efficacy was not seen in children as 
some  of  the  endpoint  at  12  months  maintenance  treatment  was  no  different  than  vehicle.  The  MAH 
was therefore requested by the CHMP to comment. 
The MAH responded that the parameters mEASI, EASI, IGA and affected BSA, were included in the 
studies  purely  to  monitor  the  disease  status  over  time.  It  was  never  planned  to  formally  compare 
tacrolimus  versus  vehicle  arm  at  any  study  time-point  for  these  non-flare  related  secondary 
parameters. The MAH had no expectation to see main improvement in the tacrolimus arm compared to 
the vehicle arm for these non-flares related secondary endpoints, since the endpoints mEASI, EASI, 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BAS and IGA are considered not to be appropriate endpoints for the study objective of assessing flare 
prevention.  Data  for  these  endpoints  were  collected  at  all  scheduled  visits  and  comparisons  of 
tacrolimus versus vehicle over time do not take into account whether patients were being treated with 
disease control treatment or with disease exacerbation treatment. 
The  MAH  believed  that  the  small  observed  differences  for  mEASI,  EASI,  IGA  and  affected  BSA 
during DCP do not translate into clinical relevance. The MAH further believed that for the assessment 
of flare prevention, only flare-specific endpoints can address this question. These secondary endpoints 
were collected at pre-defined time points and so may not be sensitive to disease exacerbations which 
could occur at any time point. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH explanation. 
For both the total population and the moderate to severe AD subset, post-baseline affected BSA values 
were  generally  lower  for  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  than  for  the  vehicle  group  during  the  DCP 
(FAS).  
For the total population as well as the moderate to severe AD subset, the proportion of patients with a 
post-baseline  IGA  score  of  ≤  2  was  higher  for  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  than  for  the  vehicle 
group throughout the DCP (FAS). The scores of the Infants Dermatology Life Quality Index (IDLQI) 
and  Children’s  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (CDLQI)  assessments  were  similarly  low  in  both 
treatment arms throughout the study. 
Discussion of Clinical Efficacy results 
As the primary and secondary endpoints were pooled for moderate and severe AD patients the CHMP 
requested the MAH to provide a separate breakdown of the primary and secondary endpoints for these 
categories separately. 
The MAH responded that the clinical development supporting the indication of maintenance treatment 
with Protopic was designed to show patient benefit in terms of reduction in number of disease flares 
over  a  period  of  12  months.  This  period  was  considered  by  the  MAH  as  long  enough  to  allow 
detection of improvement even in those subjects with less severe disease or fewer flares. 
The pre-defined primary endpoint for both studies FG-506-06-40 and FG-506-06-41 was the number 
of  disease  exacerbations  (DE)  that  required  substantial  therapeutic  intervention  during  the  Disease 
Control Period (DCP).  
Key secondary endpoints related to disease exacerbations in both studies were: 
• 
• 
Time to the first disease exacerbation requiring “substantial therapeutic intervention” 
Total number of disease exacerbations during the Disease Control Period (including those that 
did not require “substantial therapeutic intervention”) 
Time  to  the  first  disease  exacerbation  (including  those  that  didn’t  require  “substantial 
therapeutic intervention”) 
Percentage of days of disease exacerbation treatment. 
• 
• 
When  assessing  efficacy  outcome  by  severity  strata  in  the  adult  population,  the  data  consistently 
showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  the  tacrolimus  treatment  arm  (maintenance 
arm) versus the vehicle arm, regardless of disease severity as assessed at the start of the study. This 
was  the  case  for  the  primary  and  all  secondary  endpoints  related  to  disease  exacerbations.  An 
overview of the efficacy by severity strata is included in tables 21 and 22 below.   
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 21: Overview of Efficacy for Study FG-506-06-40 (Adults) 
Table 22: Overview of Efficacy for Study FG-506-06-41 (Pediatric) 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
The analysis for intra stratum comparisons in the paediatric patients, which are presented in Table 23, 
revealed that significance for all endpoints could be achieved in the moderate  severity group. In the 
severe stratum the time to first disease exacerbation requiring substantial therapeutic intervention, as 
well as the time to first disease exacerbation were statistically significant at the 5% level.  
However, the improvements in the number of disease exacerbations requiring substantial therapeutic 
intervention,  the  number  of  disease  exacerbations,  and  the  percentage  days  of  disease  exacerbation 
treatment during DCP were not statistically significant. 
For all key endpoints numerical trends in favour of tacrolimus were observed. Whether these findings 
reflect true differences between the strata or a by-chance finding is according to the MAH, difficult to 
assess, since it needs to be considered that the study was not powered to show significance for intra 
stratum comparisons. 
Table 23: 
P-values  for  Intra  Stratum  Comparisons  (Additional  Analysis)  Study  FG-506-06-41 
(Pediatric) 
When  looking  at  the  values  for  the  endpoints  there  are  numerical  differences  in  favour  of  the 
tacrolimus arm (maintenance arm). However, the differences were not statistically significant. The fact 
that  a  numerical  trend  exists  would  support  the  hypothesis  that  intra  stratum  analyses,  because 
performed on smaller groups, are prone to higher variability in analyses outcomes, leading to results 
which are not in line with clinical experience i.e. that both moderate and severe paediatric patients do 
respond to treatment with tacrolimus. 
The  MAH  believed  that  these  data  indicate  that  adults  and  children  benefit  substantially  from 
maintenance  therapy.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  studies  were  not  designed  to  show  differences  at 
strata level, the strength of the observed effect clearly favours maintenance therapy. The MAH further 
argued that this is an additional treatment option that may benefit patients and is not a replacement for 
any current therapeutic regimen. Starting a maintenance therapy regimen should be at the discretion of 
the treating physician and information about this maintenance therapy option should be made available 
to patients in all subpopulations. 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  when  assessing  efficacy  outcome  by  severity  strata  in  the  adult 
population, the data consistently show a statistically significant difference in favour of the tacrolimus 
treatment arm (maintenance arm) versus the vehicle arm, regardless of disease severity as assessed at 
the start of the study. This was the case for the primary and all secondary endpoints related to disease 
exacerbations.  In  paediatric  patients  efficacy  outcome  showed  statistically  significant  difference  in 
favour of maintenance treatment with tacrolimus in patients with moderate AD. Statistical significance 
was not shown for severe AD in children for maintenance tacrolimus treatment versus vehicle (acute 
treatment of flare up). While the study was not powered to show treatment difference per severity of 
disease there is a trend in favour of maintenance treatment. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allowing  for  the  possibility  of  disease  differences  in  adults  and  children,  the  CHMP  requested  the 
MAH  to  comment  on  differences  in  effect  seen  in  the  two  groups  and  comment  on,  and  consider 
whether  this  effect  could  be  due  to  suboptimal  treatment  in  paediatric  group  or  an  inappropriate 
treatment regimen for children. 
The  MAH  emphasised  in  their  response  that  it  is  important  to  consider  that  the  CONTROL  studies 
FG-506-06-40 and FG-506-06-41 were designed to show differences in the primary endpoint for the 
mild  to  severe  population.  The  effect  shown  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  key  secondary  endpoints 
was strong enough to be detected and to be significant for the smaller moderate to severe subgroup, in 
spite of the fact that the studies were not designed to show differences at that level of analysis. Beyond 
that,  a  high  variability  appeared  to  influence  the  outcomes  of  assessments  conducted  at  the  level  of 
individual  severity  strata,  particularly  in  the  paediatric  population  and  results  should  be  interpreted 
with caution. 
No  evidence  is  available  to  favour  a  particular  hypothesis  regarding  factors  influencing  response  to 
treatment, except the fact that these studies were not designed to run meaningful severity strata sub-
analyses. Children being less chronically affected than adults may be an important factor.  
Further, a patient with moderate disease may be expected to respond more easily to any treatment than 
a  patient  with  severe  disease.  Compliance  is  also  known  to  be  different  in  paediatric  versus  adult 
therapy overall. The MAH suggested that it is probably a combination of all these factors is closer to 
reality than one single factor. 
Data  from  study  FG-506-06-41  show  that  51.2%  of  paediatric  patients  with  moderate  AD  at  study 
entry  had  no  flare  over  a  period  of  12  months  maintenance  treatment  with  tacrolimus  ointment 
compared to 20.2% in the vehicle arm. In the group of paediatric patients with severe AD the pattern 
in favour of maintenance therapy was similar with 40.5% of patients in the tacrolimus arm presenting 
no  flare  versus  22.2%  in  the  vehicle  arm  (Table  24).  These  differences  are  considered  clinically 
meaningful to the affected patients. 
Table 24: 
Percentage  of  Patients  without  a  Disease  Exacerbations  Requiring  Substantial  Therapeutic 
Intervention Adjusted for Length of Time at Risk, Study FG-50606-41 
The MAH concluded that differences have been observed between adults and children in the response 
to  maintenance  treatment  especially  at  the  severity  strata  level.  However,  the  meaning  of  such 
differences has to be interpreted with caution considering that the clinical studies conducted were not 
designed to show statistically significant differences at that level. The MAH was of the opinion that 
the magnitude of the response to maintenance therapy (reduction in number of disease exacerbations) 
in paediatric  patients indicates that the  large number of patients having no flare over a period of 12 
months in the maintenance therapy group represents a true clinical benefit to both moderate and severe 
paediatric patients and provides evidence that the investigated regimen was effective. 
The MAH argued further that the results for patients with moderate-to-severe AD are consistent with 
those published recently from a post-marketing clinical study conducted with tacrolimus ointment in 
maintenance therapy (Study 20-04-002; Breneman et al, 2008). This was a multicentre study with 384 
adults and children, designed to assess the impact of topical corticosteroids on the safety and efficacy 
of tacrolimus ointment in the short-term treatment of AD and to evaluate the long-term efficacy and 
safety  of  3-times-weekly  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment.  The  results  showed  that  patients  treated  with 
tacrolimus  ointment  had  a  significantly  greater  number  of  flare-free  treatment  days  compared  with 
vehicle (mean, 177 vs. 134 days). Similarly, median time to first relapse was significantly longer for 
patients treated with tacrolimus ointment compared with vehicle (169 days vs. 43 days). Overall, the 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number of disease relapses per patient was significantly reduced in favour of tacrolimus and the mean 
number of disease relapse days was significantly less for tacrolimus (46 days) compared with vehicle 
(65  days).  Disease  relapse  treatment  with  twice-daily tacrolimus  ointment  was  successful  in  83%  of 
patients  in  each  group.  Finally,  the  MAH  concluded  that  the  results  of  this  study,  together  with  the 
CONTROL studies confirm that maintenance treatment of AD is an effective paradigm, and that two 
applications per week are sufficient for clinical efficacy. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  MAH  response.  In  the  CONTROL  studies  patients  were  categorised 
into  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  categories  according  to  Rajka  Langeland  criteria.  To  gain  more 
insight, the CHMP requested that the MAH should indicate the number of disease exacerbations of the 
patients enrolled in each category. The MAH was also asked to propose suitable and specific wording 
for the SPC with respect to patients most suitable for maintenance treatment, specifically the criterion 
number  of  flares  per  year,  in  line  with  the  scoring  criteria  of  moderate  and  severe  categories.  The 
MAH response is discussed in section 3.4 of this report.  
The  CHMP  agreed  with  he  MAH  that  efficacy  has  been  shown  for  maintenance  treatment.  Twice 
weekly  maintenance  treatment  has  shown  to  result  in  less  flares  of  AD  and  prolong  time  to  flare 
relapse. It should be noted that the additional summary study submitted by the MAH (Study 20-04-
002; Breneman et al, 2008) was not submitted in full by the MAH. However, the CHMP was of the 
opinion that the additional study was in support of the pivotal CONTROL studies.  
Clinical safety 
Exposure to the Drug 
At the time of the Protopic Renewal 2006, a total of 17,449 patients with AD had been treated (at least 
one  application)  with  tacrolimus  ointment  in  a  clinical  trial.  To  date  a  total  of  24,166  patients  have 
received tacrolimus ointment in clinical studies.  
Study FG-506-06-40: CONTROL Study (Adults)  
Open-Label Period  
The  most frequently reported application-site adverse events (AEs) during the OLP (N=257,  ≥ 3%), 
irrespective  of  causality,  were  irritation  (32.3%),  pruritus  (18.7%)  warmth  (7.0%)  and  folliculitis 
(4.3%). Frequently reported treatment-related AEs during the OLP (N=257, ≥ 3%), which occurred at 
application-site were: irritation (32.3%), pruritus (17.9%), warmth (7.0%) and folliculitis (4.3%). 
There  were  no  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  or  deaths  during  the  OLP.  Two  patients  had  a 
treatment-related non-serious AE that led to discontinuation (application-site pruritus; application-site 
irritation) during the OLP.

The CHMP concluded that the application site reactions application-site pruritus and application-site 
infection  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  versus  vehicle  (moderate  to 
severe AD groups). For non application site reactions nasopharyngitis, headache and respiratory tract 
infection viral occurred more commonly in the tacrolimus ointment group versus vehicle (moderate to 
severe AD groups). 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, eight patients experienced a SAE. Five patients in the tacrolimus ointment arm and three in 
the  vehicle  arm.  Six  of  the  SAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study 
medication. These comprised one patient each with renal cell carcinoma, food allergy, cholelithiasis, 
dermatitis  exfoliative,  prostate  cancer  and  breast  hyperplasia.  Two  patients  had  a  SAE  during  the 
DCP, which was considered by the investigator to be treatment-related: application-site infection with 
outcome  “recovered”  after  study  medication  was  discontinued,  and  Kaposi’s  varicelliform  eruption. 
The study medication was reduced and the patient recovered.  
Other Adverse Events 
Study discontinuation: 
Three patients had a non-serious AE that led to discontinuation, all in the vehicle group. Two of the 
AEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  medication.  Application-site 
paraesthesia (verbatim: extreme paraesthesia) was the only AE which was assessed as possibly related 
to study drug and resulted in discontinuation. No patient in the tacrolimus ointment arm discontinued 
the study due to an adverse event. 
Neoplasm: 
Neoplasms  were  diagnosed  in  seven  patients  during  the  DCP.  They  were  warts  or  verrucae  (4), 
Ledderhose’s disease (1), renal cell carcinoma (1) and prostate carcinoma (1). All but the patient with 
prostate carcinoma recovered within the study period. Only one neoplasm was assessed as related to 
study medication: one case of viral warts in the vehicle arm was assessed as probably related to study 
medication.  
Alcohol intolerance: 
Six patients experienced alcohol intolerance during the DCP, and all cases were assessed as probable 
or highly probable related to study medication. Most episodes were short and resolved on the day of 
onset, but there were three reports of ongoing adverse events at end of the study. The reported alcohol 
intolerance in two patients had already an onset during the OLP and continued into the DCP. 
Safety conclusion on study FG-506-06-40 
The  MAH  concluded  that  the  nature  and  incidence  of  AEs  in  study  FG-506-06-40  were  consistent 
with those listed in the approved SPC for tacrolimus ointment, with no apparent differences between 
patients with mild to severe AD and those with moderate to severe AD. Frequently reported treatment-
related  AEs  were  application-site  pruritus,  folliculitis,  irritation,  infection,  herpes  simplex  and 
impetigo and at non-application-site pruritus. One treatment-related AE, application-site paraesthesia, 
led  to  discontinuation.  In  seven  patients  neoplasm  was  reported,  one  case  (warts)  was  assessed  as 
being causally related to study treatment.  
The CHMP concluded that in general the adverse events recorded during study FG-506-06-40 did not 
highlighted  any  new  safety  findings.  Of  the  application  site  reactions  application-site  pruritus  and 
application-site  infection  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  versus  vehicle 
(moderate  to  severe  AD  groups).  For  non  application  site  reactions  nasopharyngitis,  headache  and 
respiratory  tract  infection  viral  occurred  more  commonly  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  group  versus 
vehicle (moderate to severe AD groups.  
Study FG-506-06-41 CONTROL Study (Paediatric patients) 
Open-label period 
The  most  frequently  reported  application-site  AEs  during  the  OLP  (N=267,  ≥  3%),  irrespective  of 
causality,  were  application-site  pruritus  (14.2%)  and  application-site  irritation  (6.0%).  The  most 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequently  reported  non-application-site  AE  during  the  OLP,  irrespective  of  causality,  was 
nasopharyngitis (5.6%). There were no SAEs or deaths during the OLP. Two patients experienced a 
treatment-related  adverse  event  that  led  to  discontinuation  during  the  OLP  (eczema  herpeticum, 
application-site  pruritus).  Both  were  of  moderate  intensity,  in  one  patient  the  event  was  reported  as 
ongoing and in the other as recovered. 
The CHMP acknowledged that application site pruritus and irritation (application site reactions) and 
nasopharyngitis  (non  application  site  reactions)  were  the  most  common  AE’s  reported.  Application 
site burning and application site pruritus are listed adverse events in section 4.8 of the SPC

The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  application  site  infection  and  impetigo  are  assessed  as  treatment 
related AE’s  and that these occurred  at a higher frequency with maintenance  treatment compared to 
vehicle treatment. Nasopharyngitis and pruritus are assessed as treatment related, non application site, 
AE’s occurring more frequently with maintenance  treatment compared with  vehicle. Findings in the 
moderate to severe subpopulation were similar to those of the total population with mild to severe AD. 
No patient died during the study. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall,  eight  serious  adverse  events  occurred.  Seven  in  patients  treated  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment 
arm  (5.6%)  and  one  in  the  vehicle  arm  (0.8%).  The  reported  serious  adverse  events  were  asthma, 
bronchopneumonia, eczema herpeticum, eczema infected, gastroenteritis, sleep apnoea syndrome and 
staphylococcal  infection.  Two  of  the  serious  adverse  events,  eczema  infected  and  eczema  herpetic, 
were reported in the same patient and were assessed by the investigator as probably related to study 
drug. The patient was withdrawn from the study on the day of onset of these adverse events, but the 
reported reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy of treatment. 
Other Adverse Events  
Study discontinuation: 
Two  patients  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  arm  discontinued  the  study  prematurely  due  to  non-serious 
adverse  events.  One  patient  experienced  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis  (verbatim:  urticaria  vasculitis), 
which was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication. The other patient had a 
non-serious  eczema  weeping  (verbatim:  weeping  and  crusting)  that  led  to  discontinuation  and  was 
rated by the investigator as possibly treatment-related. No patient in the vehicle arm discontinued the 
study due to an adverse event. 
Neoplasm: 
No malignant neoplasm occurred. Benign neoplasms, mainly skin papillomas and one case of a benign 
tumour of the finger, were diagnosed in five patients during the OLP. In addition, skin papilloma was 
diagnosed  in  eight  patients  during  the  DCP.  Six  of  the  cases  were  assessed  as  not  treatment  related 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(five cases of skin papilloma, one case of benign tumour of finger), the other seven benign neoplasms 
(all cases of skin papilloma) were rated by the investigator as being causally related to treatment  
Five of the patients with skin papilloma recovered during the study. The warts were still present at the 
end  of  the  study  in  the  two  patients  whom  developed  the  warts  late  in  the  study,  and  in one  patient 
who  was  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  an  IGA  >  2  after  6  weeks  of  disease 
exacerbation treatment. 
Safety conclusion on study FG-506-06-41 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  in  the  open-label  period  (OLP),  application  site  pruritus,  irritation  and 
nasopharyngitis  were  the  most  common  AE’s  reported.  In  the  disease  control  period  (DCP)  period 
eight serious adverse events occurred. Seven in patients treated in the tacrolimus ointment arm (5.6%) 
and  one  in  the  vehicle  arm  (0.8%).  The  reported  serious  adverse  events  were  asthma,  broncho-
pneumonia,  eczema  herpeticum,  eczema  infected,  gastroenteritis,  sleep  apnoea  syndrome  and 
staphylococcal  infection.  The  tacrolimus  ointment  arm  was  associated  with  increase  frequency  of 
application site infection, application site impetigo, nasopharyngitis these were deemed to be treatment 
related. Eczema herpticum and ecezema infection occurred in one patients leading to discontinuation 
of treatment. Seven benign neoplasms (all cases of skin papilloma) were rated by the investigator as 
being  causally  related  to  treatment.  There  was  also  an  increase  in  frequency  of  respiratory  tract 
disorders such as asthma, influenza, bacterial bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection and there 
was  also  an  increased  frequency  of  Molluscum  contagiosum  noted  in  the  tacrolimus  ointment  arm. 
However, these were not judged to be causally related by the investigators. 
Additional long term treatment safety studies supportive of the proposed maintenance treatment 
The MAH presented a number of clinical safety results from previous pre- and post-marketing long-
term safety studies conducted with the currently approved twice-daily treatment regimen. The MAH 
considered  these  studies  to  be  also  of  relevance  for  the  clinical  safety  of  the  new  proposed  twice-
weekly maintenance regimen. The main criterion for selection of these studies was that all were large 
(> 200 patients) and had twice-daily treatment with tacrolimus ointment for 6 months or longer. The 
majority of the studies described had already been included in previous submissions. The long-term (≥ 
6  months,  more  than  200  patients)  safety  and  efficacy  studies  are  listed  in  Table  27.  They  were 
conducted by the MAH in Europe and the USA and included more than 10,000 patients treated with 
tacrolimus ointment.

These  studies  were  included  by  the  MAH  as  supportive  evidence,  since  they  have  already  been 
conducted to support the marketing authorization they are not discussed further in this report. None of 
the clinical trials involved the proposed maintenance treatment regimen of twice weekly application. 
However, some of the trials listed used tacrolimus for up to 6 months continuously. 
As  the  proposed  maintenance  treatment  regimen  is  supported  by  two  12  month  control  studies  the 
CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  summarise  all  safety  information  available  to  specifically  justify 
maintenance treatment in patients for more than 12 months. 
The  MAH  responded  that  the  clinical  and  post-marketing  information  collected  to  date  with  the 
intermittent  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment  is  extensive  and  represents  one  of  the  largest  clinical 
developments conducted for a dermatology product approved in Europe. Based on this information the 
safety  profile  as  specified  in  the  currently  approved  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  has  been 
defined for total time of up to 4 years in clinical studies. To date the CONTROL studies FG-506-06-40 
and FG-506-06-41 are the only evidence available to support the clinical safety of the recommended 
dosing regimen for maintenance therapy (twice weekly, once a day) and this for up to 12 months. The 
MAH argued that it is fair to assume that patients applying tacrolimus ointment on a cleared to mildly 
affected skin will be doing so on tissue which has recovered its integrity to a large extent. This in turn 
will  substantially  limit  the  penetration  of  the  active  substance  into  the  skin  and  subsequently  into 
systemic circulation. The total amount of tacrolimus ointment applied on the skin over 12 months of 
maintenance therapy in the CONTROL studies was similar or lower than the amount applied after 12 
months in clinical safety studies conducted for up to 4 years in which tacrolimus ointment was used as 
intermittent therapy twice daily (see table 29). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 29:  Ointment Utilization Across Selected Studies. Month 12 data 
The MAH was therefore  of the opinion that the overall exposure to drug is similar, or lower, in the 
CONTROL  studies  at  12  months  utilisation  than  at  12  months  in  previous  clinical  studies  with  an 
intermittent twice daily regimen conducted beyond a year. 
The CHMP agreed that safety has been assessed for 12 months maintenance treatment. However, the 
safety beyond 12 months of maintenance treatment has not been established. The MAH points out that 
once  the  exacerbation  has  settled  and  skin  integrity  has  been  restored  the  amount  of  systemic 
absorption will be less than treating patients during acute disease exacerbations. Table 29 shows that 
for  adult  patients  the  amount  of  tacrolimus  ointment  used  during maintenance  treatment  is  less  than 
the amount used in treatment of acute exacerbations over 12 months by comparing the control study 
with long term safety studies over 12 months. 
It was not clear to the Committee whether the patients in the studies listed in table 29 are comparable 
in  terms  of  disease  severity.  With  respect  to  paediatric  data  table  29  shows  that  patients  using 
maintenance  treatment  (2-6  years  and  7-15  years)  utilise  more  tacrolimus  ointment  during 
maintenance treatment than treating acute exacerbations. However, the benefit of using maintenance 
treatment  results  in  a  lower  incidence  of  disease  exacerbations  and  longer  disease  free  intervals.  No 
additional safety data has been seen between 12 months maintenance treatment and treatment of acute 
disease exacerbations. The Committee therefore recommended that the SPC shall specify that safety of 
maintenance treatment beyond 12 months has not been established. 
Furthermore, the MAH argued that the adverse event profile at 12 months of maintenance therapy is 
essentially  the  same  as  the  profile  observed  in  all  long-term  clinical  investigations  conducted  and 
submitted  to  date  for  periods  of  follow-up  beyond  12  months.  Therefore,  the  MAH  thought  it 
reasonable  to  assume  that  the  safety  profile  with  tacrolimus  ointment  during  maintenance  therapy 
when applied for longer than 12 months should be similar to that seen in long-term studies using the 
currently approved regimen. The MAH assessed the available information from the perspective of the 
total number of days treated in clinical studies using the standard long-term intermittent paradigm for 
which follow-up periods beyond 12 months are available (see table 30 for details). 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety reported from long-term studies (>12 months) with intermittent long-term use and a high 
percentage of days in treatment are relevant to estimate the long-term safety of maintenance treatment 
after 12 months. 
Table 30: 
Percentage of Days with Tacrolimus Ointment Treatment 
There are two main studies that the MAH considers relevant (FG-506-06-21 and FHI-97-038), both of 
which  are  of  4  years’  duration  and  represent  the  longest  follow-up  relevant  to  maintenance  therapy. 
Although presented already in previous submissions, a brief overview of the safety results of these two 
studies  is  included  in  this  report  for  selected  events  relevant  to  the  question  and  for  the  sake  of 
completeness. 
FHI-97-038 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  0.1%  tacrolimus 
ointment when used twice-daily either continuously or intermittently for the treatment of AD in adult 
and  paediatric  patients.  The  four  most  common  drug-related  adverse  events  were  skin  burning 
(25.2%),  pruritus  (22.8%),  skin  erythema  (9.5%)  and  skin  infection  (which  included  all  cutaneous 
infections  not  otherwise  specified,  such  as  bacterial  infections,  molluscum  and  pyoderma)  (5.5%). 
Hazard  rates  for  individual  events  were  calculated  and  showed  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful 
increase in risk for any adverse event, including infections, over time. The assessment of the incidence 
of infections of clinical interest showed that, in general, the overall incidence of infections tended to 
be greater in paediatric patients compared with adults. Individual infections that tended to occur with 
substantially  greater  incidence  among  paediatric  patients  were  those  that  would  be  expected  in  a 
paediatric population over a 4-year period: skin infection, pustular rash, skin neoplasm benign, flu-like 
symptoms,  fever,  pharyngitis,  increased  cough  and  otitis  media.  The  incidence  of  skin  infections  in 
adults  and  children  treated  with  topical  tacrolimus  in  this  study  was  consistent  with,  or  lower  than 
previous reports in AD in general (David et al, 1986). The incidence of cutaneous infections such as 
herpes  simplex,  eczema  herpeticum,  warts  or  molluscum  contagiosum  among  patients  treated  with 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tacrolimus  ointment  in  this  study  was  lower  than  or  consistent  with  previously  published  reports 
(Bonifazi et al, 1985; David and Longson, 1985; Bork et al,1988). 
During  the  study,  five  patients  were  diagnosed  with  seven  skin  cancers:  three  basal  cell  carcinomas 
(BCCs), three SCCs and one sebaceous carcinoma (SC). Two of these patients had a prior history of 
skin cancer and, in one patient, both BCC and SCC were detected before first exposure. 
FG-506-06-21 
The primary objective of this study was to obtain further information on the safety of 0.1% tacrolimus 
ointment when used continuously or intermittently for up to four years in patients previously enrolled 
into company-sponsored clinical studies with tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of AD. A total of 
782 patients were treated with study medication in 39 centres in twelve European countries. The four 
most common causally related adverse events in all patients were skin burning (282 patients, 36.1%), 
pruritus (108 patients, 13.8%), folliculitis (78 patients, 10.0%) and skin infection (77 patients, 9.8%). 
The  percentage  of  days  treated  for  disease  exacerbation  with  tacrolimus  ointment  (i.e.  twice-daily 
treatment)  is  lower  in  the  paediatric  and  adult  CONTROL  studies  with  the  maintenance  regimen 
compared with long-term studies. Adding the percentage of days treated with the maintenance regimen 
(i.e. once-daily, twice-weekly tacrolimus ointment) would yield a similar or lower percentage of days 
treated with tacrolimus ointment.  
The two clinical studies presented above are those with the longest intermittent twice daily treatment 
available to date. The safety profile of tacrolimus ointment after up to 4 years intermittent therapy in 
these studies  was very similar to that after 1 year of maintenance  therapy in the CONTROL studies 
and is also similar to that in study 20-04-002. The MAH believed, therefore, that the long-term safety 
of  tacrolimus  ointment  when  used  as  maintenance  therapy  for  longer  than  12  months  should  not  be 
different to the profile reported for studies such as FHI-97-038 and FG-506-06-21. 
Epidemiological and Drug Utilization Studies 
Epidemiological Data  
It  has  been  suggested  that  a  sub-chronic  state  of  inflammation  in  certain  tissues  makes  it  likely  that 
atopy is responsible for positive associations with cancer risk (Wang and Diepgen 2006). Conversely, 
when atopy is regarded as a hyper reactive state of the immune system, it is usually assumed to reflect 
a  shift  in  the  T  lymphocyte  response  away  from  Th1-  towards  Th2-dominated  activity,  although 
coexistence  of  Th1-mediated  diseases  and  Th2-induced  disorders  have  been  described  (Wang  et  al 
2006).  Theoretically,  this  hyper  reactive  state  could  be  accompanied  by  enhanced  immune 
surveillance,  which  in  turn  may  decrease  the  chance  of  proliferation  of  aberrant  cells  and  reduce 
cancer risk.  
Epidemiological studies have therefore been conducted to try to resolve this apparent contradiction. 
In  23  publications,  AD  was  implicated  in  the  risk  of  hematological  (childhood  leukemia,  adult 
leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL] and different hematological cancers), pancreatic, skin and 
brain malignancies. The overall picture from these studies, however, shows that a history of AD may 
be  associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of  pancreatic  cancer,  brain  tumour  and  childhood  leukemia, 
although in most instances the findings were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the findings of 
the epidemiological studies tend to support a lower risk of cancer among persons with a history of AD. 
Although a more careful definition of AD is needed, these epidemiological studies could provide an 
estimate  of  the  background  cancer  risk  in  patients  with  AD  when  the  long-term  effects  of  AD 
treatments are assessed. 
The CHMP acknowledged that the findings of the epidemiological studies tend to support a lower risk 
of cancer among persons with a history of AD.

Drug Utilisation Studies (DUS)  
On 28 June 2006 the MAH provided a proposal to CHMP to conduct Drug Utilization Studies (DUS) 
prior to the planned submission of a protocol for an epidemiological study. The DUS intended to allow 
a better characterization of the use of Protopic in Europe, and to provide an indication whether there is 
sufficient exposure since product launch in the EU, prior to making a proposal for a protocol for the 
requested  epidemiological  study.  The  DUS  were  conducted  in  two  well  recognized  population 
databases (General Practice Research Database [GPRD], UK and PHARMO RLS, Netherlands).  
The primary objective of these studies was to characterize the profile of topical calcineurin inhibitor 
(TCI) users in Europe as well as the overall exposure to this therapeutic class, i.e. the number of users 
of tacrolimus ointment and/or pimecrolimus cream in the UK and the Netherlands and, if possible, the 
duration of use of tacrolimus ointment and/or pimecrolimus cream. Additionally, exploratory analyses 
were  conducted  on  the  basis  of  the  collected  information,  as  to  describe  outcomes,  specifically  skin 
cancer, in patients using these drugs.  
Overall,  the  results  of  these  studies  suggested  that  apart  from  some  small  exceptions,  the  way 
tacrolimus  ointment  and  pimecrolimus  cream  are  used  in  the  Netherlands  and  in  the  UK  are 
comparable.  The  outcome  of  the  exploratory  analyses  showed  no  statistically  significant  association 
between the use of TCIs and the development of skin cancer. However, due to the recent introduction 
of  TCIs  in  both  countries,  the  duration  of  follow-up  (on  average  approximately  two  years)  was 
relatively short as well as the treatment durations of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream. In 
addition,  details  were  not  available  on  the  site  and  extent  of  exposure  of  TCI  (i.e.  the  size  of  BSA 
treated), on the location of the skin cancer on the body, and hence whether the skin cancer occurred at 
the site of TCI application. 
The GPRD  concluded that ‘if any adverse effect of  TCI exposure would only occur after prolonged 
exposure  and  several  years  after  exposure,  this  GPRD  study  is  unlikely  to  have  been  able  to  detect 
such an effect. For this reason, it is recommended that further research is conducted once more long 
term data on TCI exposure is available on larger number of patients’. 
The  Pharmo  Institute  concluded  that  ‘The  main  conclusion  was  the  drug  utilization  of  TCI’s  is  in 
accordance  with  the  Dutch  treatment  guidelines  in  the  Netherlands  and  that  no  association  between 
TCI use and incidence of skin cancer could be established. The low skin cancer incidence, the short 
follow  up  duration,  the  limited  information  on  volume  of  ointment  or  cream  applied,  the  lack  of 
information on the size and localization of the skin surface treated and the lack of information about 
key risk factors such as ultraviolet light exposure necessitates research in the later future in order to 
obtain conclusive results’. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  while  no  direct  association  could  be  found  both  studies  have  stated 
limitations  with  the  studies  and  the  ability  to  detect incidence  of skin  cancer.  It  was  also  stated  that 
further research would be necessary to conclude whether an association exists. 
In an effort to better understand the risk of lymphoma in patients with atopic dermatitis compared with 
the general population, a systematic review of epidemiological data in the literature was sponsored by 
Astellas (Diepgen 2007). Two of three cohort studies showed evidence for a trend towards a slightly 
increased risk of lymphoma for patients with AD. However, this association could not be confirmed 
by any case-control study included in the systematic review. The absence of a consistent trend in the 
outcome of the reviewed literature supports the absence of a relationship between AD and the risk of 
lymphoma. A nested case-control study in the PharMetrics database evaluated the association between 
topical  immunosuppressants  and  lymphoma  in  a  cohort  of  patients  with  AD  (Arellano  et  al.,  2007). 
The analysis of 294 cases of lymphoma that was performed in 293,253 patients, 81 of which were in 
patients  younger  than  20  years,  did  not  find  an  increased  risk  of  lymphoma  in  patients  treated  with 
topical  calcineurin  inhibitors.  An  adjusted  analysis  showed  severity  of  AD  as  the  main  factor 
associated with an increased risk of lymphoma.

Tacrolimus usage – Maintenance vs. Intermittent use  
As described earlier in this report the data showed that the mean total amount of tacrolimus ointment 
use (g) in patients randomised in the tacrolimus arm is similar in adult patients to that in the vehicle 
arm  (including  intermittent  treatment  in  case  of  a  flare).  The  corresponding  data  in  the  paediatric 
population  showed  a  higher  tacrolimus  ointment  use  in  the  tacrolimus  arm.  Because  more  patients 
withdrew  in  the  vehicle  arm  compared  with  the  tacrolimus  arm,  however,  drug  usage  was  also 
calculated  on  a  per-patient  basis  taking  into  consideration  the  number  of  days  in  the  DCP  for  the 
individual patient. This calculation showed that the mean daily usage of tacrolimus ointment was not 
higher  in  the  tacrolimus  arm  compared  with  the  vehicle  arm  in  either  the  adult  or  paediatric 
populations.  
It  is  difficult  to  compare  the  tacrolimus  arm  to  the  vehicle  arm  with  respect  to  daily  tacrolimus 
ointment  use,  however,  as  a  result  of  the  wide  and  treatment  regimen-dependent  distribution  of  the 
data.  It  is  perhaps  more  important  to  consider  systemic,  as  well  as  skin  compartment,  tacrolimus 
exposure  over  time.  The  MAH  provided  data  showing  that  tacrolimus  ointment  use  to  treat  disease 
exacerbations is markedly less for the tacrolimus arm than the vehicle arm. When tacrolimus ointment 
is  applied  for  maintenance  treatment  to  skin  in  remission,  this  will  lead  to  minimal  exposure  to 
tacrolimus in the skin and in the systemic circulation. Furthermore, in a twice weekly regimen, based 
on the data from study FG-506-06-30, The MAH postulated that at the end of the period between two 
applications, the skin compartment will be almost devoid of tacrolimus. 
Although patients on maintenance therapy may overall have lower total tacrolimus dose than patients 
on  intermittent  therapy,  maintenance  therapy  would  represent  continuous  exposure  of  the  skin  to 
tacrolimus.  The  CHMP  therefore  requested  the  MAH  to  discuss  whether  patients  on  maintenance 
treatment  regimen  are  at  an  increased  risk  of  developing  skin  cancer  such  as  cutaneous  t  cell 
lymphoma. 
The  MAH  responded  that  tacrolimus  is  a  highly  lipophilic  molecule  and  thus  an  intact  stratum 
corneum  is  likely  to  be  the  main  barrier  to  percutaneous  absorption.  The  combination  of  large 
molecular weight and high lipophilicity means that tacrolimus will be selectively delivered to the skin, 
with minimal exposure into systemic circulation. The MAH also discussed dermal pharmacokinetics 
in  ex  vivo  models.  Using  a  Franz  diffusion  cell  the  rate  and  extent  of  penetration  through  intact 
epidermis  was  low.  The  rate  of  tacrolimus  penetration  was  approximately  seven-fold  higher  in  skin 
sections devoid of stratum corneum, as compared to intact skin. This difference strongly suggests that 
the  intact  stratum  corneum  is  the  main  rate-limiting  barrier  to  cutaneous  permeability  of  tacrolimus 
(Undre et al, 2003). Following that the MAH continued to discuss pharmacokinetics in healthy adult 
subjects, clinical data on systemic exposure in patients with moderate to severe AD and finally drugs 
usage (maintenance versus intermittent use).   
In  conclusion  the  MAH  argued  that  available  data  from  systemic  immunosuppressive  agents  in 
transplant  patients  suggests  that  prolonged  and  sustained  immunosuppression  is  associated  with  an 
increased  risk  of  developing  lymphomas  and  skin  malignancies.  The  more  likely  conclusion  is 
therefore that the total cumulative exposure in the new proposed maintenance treatment regimen (once 
a day, twice weekly) will be lower than in the currently registered treatment regimen. The MAH thus 
concluded that the patients on maintenance treatment regimen are unlikely to be at an increased risk of 
developing skin cancer such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma. 
The CHMP acknowledged the MAH explanation that the systemic absorption is very low and having 
an intact stratum corneum is the main rate-limiting barrier to cutaneous permeability of tacrolimus and 
that the MAH has shown that systemic absorption in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis 
decreases  as  skin  heals  and  becomes  intact.  When  tacrolimus  ointment  is  applied  for  maintenance 
treatment to skin in remission, this will lead to minimal exposure to tacrolimus in the skin and in the 
systemic  circulation.  Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  from  study  FG-506-06-30,  the 
committee  was  of  the  opinion  that  it  can  be  postulated  that  at  the  end  of  the  period  between  two 
applications (of maintenance treatment), the skin compartment will be almost devoid of tacrolimus. In 
the ‘intermittent treatment’ (treatment of acute exacerbations) paradigm approximately 7-fold higher 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
skin  concentrations  as  well  as  systemic  exposure  can  be  postulated  based  on  extrapolation  from  ex 
vivo dermal permeability experiment. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the cumulative absorption to 
both the skin and systemic compartments will be lower in patients treated as maintenance therapy than 
patients being treated during acute exacerbations. Overall, the CHMP agreed with the MAH response. 
However, the Committee requested that the MAH should be specifying in the SPC that safety beyond 
12 months maintenance treatment has not been established. 
In  addition,  the  CHMP  still  had  concerns  regarding  the  long  term  safety  and  risk  of  lymphoma, 
including  cutaneous  T  cell.  The  MAH  had  provided  a  justification  for  12  months  continuous 
maintenance  treatment  but  as  patients  may  use  tacrolimus  beyond  12  months,  a  concern  existed  for 
long term safety in patients in this situation. Therefore, before an indication for maintenance treatment 
could be granted, the CHMP was seeking further assurance on the long term safety for the proposed 
indication  for  maintenance  treatment.  The  MAH  was  subsequently  requested  to  provide  a  detailed 
discussion  of  the  benefit  risk  of  continuous  treatment  of  tacrolimus  in  adults  and  children.  In  the 
context of continuous treatment indication the MAH was requested to provide a detailed overview of 
the following points: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
The effects on the adult immunological system and on a developing immune system. 
Summary results of relevant follow-up measures (FUMs; including APPLES study), completed 
studies and ongoing studies.

maintenance treatment. 
Overall  benefit  risk  of  continuous  tacrolimus  treatment  in  children  and  adults  with  atopic 
dermatitis (AD). 
In response to the CHMP request the MAH provided a detailed response to the points listed. The 
following paragraph includes summaries of the responses provided by the MAH.  
Effects on the immune system 
A vaccination study was performed in over 200 children treated with moderate to severe AD who were 
treated for the latter with either a standard corticosteroid regimen or 0.03% tacrolimus ointment. The 
immune  response  was  equivalent  in  the  two  groups  and  ointment  application  did  not  affect  the 
immediate  response  to  vaccination,  generation  of  immune  memory  or  humoral  and  cell-mediated 
immunity.  Overall,  studies  in  patients  with  AD  suggest  that  topical  long-term  treatment  with 
tacrolimus  ointment  does  not  cause  systemic  immunosuppression.  A  comparative  study  in  21  adults 
with AD investigated the effects of twice daily tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or triamcinolone acetonide 
0.1% on immunological markers including CD4 and CD8 cell counts. The results indicated that local 
immunocompetence  was  not  adversely  affected  by  topical  tacrolimus  application.  Recall  antigen 
testing  shows  that  patients  with  active  AD  have  impaired  reactions  compared  with  the  general 
population.  A  study  in  48  adults  with  moderate-to-severe  AD  showed  that  skin  healing  after 
tacrolimus ointment treatment led to significant improvement in skin immunity. 
Summary results of relevant FUMs, APPLES, completed studies and ongoing studies. 
Non-clinical studies did not raise any major concerns that prohibited approval of tacrolimus ointment. 
The  MAH  believed  that,  if  these  studies  are  considered  with  a  maintenance  regimen  of  tacrolimus 
ointment in mind, the risk/benefit remains the same as for the present indication. Ex vivo data indicate 
that  percutaneous  absorption  through  healed  skin,  as  in  the  case  of  maintenance  therapy,  will  be 
approximately  7-fold  lower  than  absorption  through  inflamed  (damaged)  skin.  The  clinical 
development program of tacrolimus was one of the largest ever undertaken in the field of dermatology. 
None  of  the  completed  or  ongoing  studies  have  suggested  a  major  long-term  safety  issue  with 
tacrolimus.  The  CONTROL  studies  show  that  maintenance  therapy  with  once-daily,  twice-weekly 
tacrolimus ointment is effective in reducing the number of disease exacerbations and delaying the time 
to  first  exacerbation  when  compared  with  standard,  intermittent  therapy.  Exposure  to  tacrolimus 
ointment  (based  on  the  percentage  of  days  of  treatment)  was  similar  or  lower  in  the  CONTROL 
studies  to  that  in  long-term  (≤4  years)  studies  using  traditional  intermittent  treatment.  There  is, 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therefore,  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  safety  of  long-term  intermittent  treatment.  Results  from  a 
clinical  trial  of  three-times  weekly  tacrolimus  ointment  provide  further  evidence  of  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  the  maintenance  treatment  paradigm.  Clinical  data  published  by  independent  investigators 
and drug utilization studies conducted by the MAH have not indicated that topical calcineurin inhibitor 
use  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing  non-melanoma  skin  cancer  (NMSC)  or 
lymphoma. 
Post-marketing safety data detailing long-term use applicable to the proposed indication of continuous 
treatment 
Two recently completed studies may provide additional evidence for the safety of tacrolimus ointment 
because  of  the  large  number  of  patients  treated  or  the  duration  of  their  follow-up.  Study  FJ-00A02 
examined long-term (3 years) treatment with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in adults with AD. Study FJ-
00B02  was  a  12  week  study  enrolling  over  1000  paediatric  patients,  applying  tacrolimus  0.03% 
ointment  once  or  twice  daily.  Safety  findings  from  these  studies  were  commensurate  with  safety 
findings presented in previously submitted dossiers and demonstrated acceptable profiles. No cases of 
skin malignancies were recorded in either trial.

Risk of developing CTCL, lymphoma and skin malignancies with continuous maintenance treatment 
As 
that  sustained  systemic 
immunosuppression  using  substantial  doses  of  one  or  more  immunosuppressive  drugs  in  transplant 
patients  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing  lymphomas  and  skin  malignancies.

permeability experiments  suggests  that  the  ‘intermittent  treatment’  paradigm  will  be  associated  with 
approximately  7-fold  higher  skin  concentrations  and  systemic  exposure.  Thus,  from  a  cumulative 
exposure  point  of  view,  the  total  amount  of  tacrolimus  in  the  skin  as  well  as  in  the  systemic 
compartment is likely to be higher with intermittent treatment compared with maintenance treatment. 
Patients  receiving  maintenance  treatment  are  therefore  unlikely  to  be  at  an  increased  risk  of

Overall benefit risk of maintenance in children and adults 
The CONTROL studies clearly indicated that, compared to a standard tacrolimus ointment regimen, 
maintenance treatment over 12 months lead to improvements including: 
−  Fewer major flares 
−  A longer time to relapse (first flare) 
−  A lower number of days using twice-daily flare treatment 
−  The above efficacy results were achieved with no major differences in the safety profiles of the 
two regimens and no substantial increase in ointment use in the maintenance arm. 
In summary, the MAH believed that there is a strong case to allow physicians the AD treatment option 
of maintenance therapy with tacrolimus ointment. The MAH concedes that there are theoretical risks 
with  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment  for  periods  of  much  greater  than  12  months.  Measures  have  been 
proposed, however, to minimize these risks and ensure that these can be monitored and kept to within 
acceptable levels. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  MAH  response  and  agreed  that  based  on  the  current  data  the  safety 
profile  appears  non-problematic.  However,  the  safety  profile  is  to  some  degree  based  on  indirect 
evidence/arguments.  The  CHMP  therefore  had  some  concerns  regarding  the  chronic  use  beyond  12 
months in children. The Committee therefore requested the MAH to commit to undertake a long term 
follow-up pf paediatric patients under maintenance  therapy. The MAH agreed to the CHMP request 
(see section IV for a listing of follow-up measures).    
In  addition  to  the  CHMP  concern  regarding  long  term  safety  in  children,  the  Committee  asked  the 
MAH to further elucidate on a few other safety concerns. The MAH was therefore asked to comment 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on how patients are to avoid or minimise sunlight exposure with maintenance treatment. As the safety 
of  tacrolimus  treatment  has  not  been  established  in  pregnancy,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  explain 
preventative measures to minimise inadvertent use of tacrolimus during pregnancy. Finally, the MAH 
was  requested  to  explain whether  there  is  a  risk  of misuse  of  tacrolimus  ointment  and  inappropriate 
self medication with tacrolimus ointment and whether risk minimisation measures are proposed. 
The  MAH  responded  that  in  the  absence  of  conclusive  data  allowing  the  exclusion  of  a  risk  of 
photocarcinigenicity  when  topically  treating  with  tacrolimus  ointment,  the  MAH  proposed  the 
following  wording  for  Section  4.4.  “Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use”  as  stated  in  the 
currently approved SPC to address UV and sunlight exposure while under treatment with tacrolimus 
ointment: 
“Exposure  of  the  skin  to  sunlight  should  be  minimised  and  the  use  of  ultraviolet  (UV)  light  from  a 
solarium, therapy with UVB or UVA in combination with psoralens (PUVA) should be avoided during 
use  of  Protopic  ointment  (see  section  5.3).  Physicians  should  advise  patients  on  appropriate  sun 
protection  methods,  such  as  minimisation  of  the  time  in  the  sun,  use  of  a  sunscreen  product  and 
covering of the skin with appropriate clothing.” 
Since approval in February 2002 and the finalisation of the renewal procedure in March 2006, some 
additional data and publications both of animal and human data have been made available, indicating 
there is no increased risk when exposed to UV-light while receiving tacrolimus ointment treatment. In 
their response, the MAH summarised some of the relevant studies. In the view of the MAH, the data 
provided  evidence  supporting  the  absence  of  increased  risk  from  UV  exposure  concomitant  to 
treatment with tacrolimus ointment. The MAH believed that the current wording addresses the issue 
sufficiently and in an adequate manner, also for patients being under a maintenance regimen. 
In relation to pregnancy it was the opinion of the MAH that the current wording accurately reflects the 
status  of  scientific  information  both  for  the  approved  indication  and  the  proposed  maintenance 
treatment regimen. The application of tacrolimus ointment on skin lesions in remission or only mildly 
affected  during  maintenance  therapy  is  not  expected  to  increase  identified  or  potential  risks  as  the 
amount  present  in  the  skin  is  expected  to  be  very  low  and  the  fraction  that  could  potentially  reach 
systemic circulation even lower.  
Regarding the risk of misuse and inappropriate self medication the MAH responded that considering 
the  fact  that  tacrolimus  ointment  is  applied  at  home  by  the  patient  or  by  the  care  giver  in  case  of 
children, misuse and inappropriate self medication cannot be excluded, and it is beyond the MAH to 
entirely  prevent  this.  The  MAH  proposed  to  address  the  issue  with  two  risk  minimization  measures 
based on the education of both prescribing physicians and patients/care givers. The proposed measures 
are further discussed in section 3.5 of this report.  
The CHMP acknowledged that the MAH has adequately addressed this issue and the warning should 
remain in section 4.4 and the wording to section 4.6 should not be amended. 
1.4  SPC and PL 
The  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  propose  a  suitable  wording  for  section  4.1  and  4.2  for  the 
categories  of  patients  most  suitable  for  maintenance  treatment.  The  criteria  of  Rajka  and  Langeland 
were to be explained in the SPC. The MAH was also asked to include clear guidance to indicate which 
patients are considered suitable for maintenance treatment. 
The MAH replied that the criteria of Rajka and Langeland are a simple system for baseline grading of 
the  severity  of  atopic  dermatitis  in  clinical  practice.  The  grading,  which  may  be  carried  out  on  the 
basis  of  one  single  consultation,  permits  distinction  between  mild,  moderate  and  severe  atopic 
dermatitis by means of a score summation using the following parameters: 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Extent  (by  "rule  of  nine"  division  of  the  body  surface:  head  and  upper  extremity  9%  each, 
anterior and posterior body and lower extremity 18% each, genital area 1%) 
Course (via history: more or less than 3 months remission during a year or continuous course) 
Intensity (disturbance of night's sleep by itching). 
The MAH was of the opinion that the criteria of Rajka and Langeland are not easy to translate into 
SPC  language  helping  prescribers  to  identify  which  patients  are  to  be  considered  suitable  for 
maintenance  treatment.  Instead  the  MAH  argued  that  a  wording  in  line  with  the  criteria  used  in  the 
clinical trials supporting this application to define success of the Open Label Period i.e. Investigator 
Global Assessment (IGA) may be easier to understand by the majority of prescribers and also easier to 
translate  into  lay  language  in  the  Patient  Information.  Accordingly  the  MAH  suggested  an  updated 
wording of sections 4.1 and 4.2.  
The CHMP did not fully agree with the wording suggested by the MAH as the proposed information 
did not clarify that a benefit /risk assessment should be undertaken and safety data beyond 12 months 
maintenance  treatment  is  not  available.  In  addition  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that 
the  Committee 
recommendations  for  stopping 
recommended the following wording. 
included.  Subsequently 
treatment  should  be 
Section 4.1: 
‘Maintenance treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for the prevention of flares and the 
prolongation of flare-free intervals in patients experiencing a high frequency of disease exacerbations 
(i.e. occurring 4 or more times per year) who have had an initial response to a maximum of 6 weeks 
treatment of twice daily tacrolimus ointment (lesions cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected).’ 
Section 4.2:  
‘Maintenance 
Patients who are responding to up to 6 weeks treatment using tacrolimus ointment twice daily (lesions 
cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected) are suitable for maintenance treatment. 
Protopic ointment should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas 
commonly affected by atopic dermatitis to prevent progression to flares. Between applications there 
should be 2-3 days without Protopic treatment. 
Adult patients (16 years of age and above) should use Protopic 0.1% ointment, children (2 years of 
age and above) should use the lower strength Protopic 0.03% ointment. 
If signs of a flare reoccur, twice daily treatment should be re-initiated (see treatment section above). 
After 12 months, a review of the patient’s condition should be conducted by the physician and a 
decision taken whether to continue maintenance treatment in the absence of safety data for 
maintenance treatment beyond 12 months. In children, this review should include suspension of 
treatment to assess the need to continue this regimen and to evaluate the course of the disease.’ 
SPC Section 4.4: 
As  a  further  risk  minimization  measure  the  CHMP  recommended  the  inclusion  of  the  following 
sentence to section 4.4 of the SPC. 
‘The development of any new change different from previous eczema within a treated area should be 
reviewed by the physician.’ 
SPC Section 4.8 
Based on the observed difference in frequency of maintenance treatment versus vehicle treatment the 
CHMP requested the MAH to list the two in tabular form in section 4.8. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH responded that the term tacrolimus ointment group is used when referring to maintenance 
treatment  and  vehicle  group  is  used  when  referring  to  tacrolimus  ointment  intermittent  use  as 
approved. The most frequently reported AEs (≥3%) reported, irrespective of relationship to the study 
drug  in  adult  patients  (FG-506-06-40)  were  the  application-site  adverse  events  pruritus,  folliculitis, 
irritation,  infection,  herpes  simplex  and  impetigo.  The  most  frequent  non-application  site  adverse 
events (≥3%) were nasopharyngitis, headache, pruritus, influenza, herpes simplex, pharyngolaryngeal 
pain,  pyrexia  and  viral  respiratory  tract  infection.  The  incidences  of  these  AEs  are  summarised  in 
Table 31. 
Table 31: 
Incidence of Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events, Regardless of Relationship to Study 
Drug, During Disease Control Period, Study FG-506-06-40 (Adults).  
In the target population for the variation application (moderate to severe AD patients) application-site 
infection,  nasopharyngitis,  headache  and  respiratory  tract  infection  viral  were  reported  more 
frequently  in  the  tacrolimus  arm  than  in  the  vehicle  arm.  However,  when  looking  at  adverse  events 
assessed by the investigator and defined as highly probable, probable, possible or missing relationship 
to study medication, then only application site infection is reported more frequently in the tacrolimus 
group  than  in  the  vehicle  group  (Table  32).  None  of  the  other  adverse  events,  nasopharyngitis, 
headache  and  respiratory  tract  infection  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  at  least  possibly 
related to study drug in the tacrolimus ointment group and were therefore not considered for addition 
to the proposed draft SPC. 
Table 32: 
Incidence of Most Frequently Reported Treatment-Related Adverse Events During Disease 
Control Period, Study FG-506-06-40 (Adults).  
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of application site (skin) infections reported in adult AD patients across the long-term 
studies has been variable in a range from 2.4% up to 7.3% and the rate reported in study FG-506-06-
40  in  the  maintenance  group  (5.2%  mild  to  severe,  6.3%  moderate  to  severe)  is  within  that  range. 
Atopic dermatitis patients are known to be at increased risk for developing skin infections per se; the 
MAH believed that the difference observed in the CONTROL study are within the variability one may 
expect  when  conducting  clinical  studies.  In  the  case  of  study  FG-506-06-40,  the  difference  between 
treatment arms in the moderate to severe group is 3.6% which corresponds to an absolute number of 
about 3 patients, and is not thought to deserve separate listing in the SPC. 
Paediatric data 
When  looking  at  adverse  events  assessed  to  be  at  least  possibly  related  to  study  medication  by  the 
investigator  (Table  33),  only  application-site  impetigo,  application-site  infection,  pruritus  and 
nasopharyngitis were reported more frequently in the tacrolimus group. 
Table 33: 
Incidence of Most Frequently Reported Treatment-Related Adverse Events During Disease 
Control Period, Study FG-506-06-41 (Paediatrics). 
The MAH was therefore of the opinion that the incidences of skin infections at the application site in 
the CONTROL study were within the range of what has been reported in previous studies. The MAH 
had no explanation on why in the CONTROL study a higher incidence of non-application site pruritus 
has been reported for children in the tacrolimus arm.  
Considering  all  the  above,  the  MAH  believed  that  there  are  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the 
safety profile of tacrolimus ointment when used in a maintenance regimen as compared to the safety 
profile approved in the current SPC. Therefore, the MAH was of the opinion that Section 4.8 of the 
SPC covers both indications and does not require any update. 
Following  the  MAH  response  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  control  studies  are  the  pivotal 
studies  which  support  the  variation  to  the  SPC.  An  increased  rate  of  application  site  infections  was 
noted  to  occur  in  patients  on  maintenance  treatment  (6.3%  versus  2.7%)  in  adult  patients  with  AD. 
Differences  were  also  noted  to  occur  in  paediatric  patients  with  AD  treated  with  tacrolimus 
maintenance  treatment versus vehicle.  As the  additional studies are not  the basis of this  application, 
the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  additional  adverse  events  noted  to  occur  were  assigned  as 
probable or possibly related to tacrolimus maintenance treatment should be added to section 4.8 of the 
SPC and also mentioned in the patient information leaflet. The recommended wording for inclusion in 
section 4.8 was therefore as follows: 
‘In a study of maintenance treatment (twice weekly treatment) in  adults and children with moderate 
and severe atopic dermatitis the following adverse events were noted to occur more frequently than in 
the control group: application site impetigo (7.7% in children) and application site infections (6.4% in 
children and 6.3% in adults).’ 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SPC Section 5.1 
With this variation the MAH also updated Section 5.1 with a description of the two studies submitted 
and the results (see attachment 1 for the full text).  
1.5  Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Plan  
Risk Management Plan  
Together  with  this  application  the  MAH  submitted  a  first  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(RMP).  The RMP initially submitted was not considered by the CHMP to be consistent with Volume 
9A  and  the RMP  template  (EMEA/192632/2006). The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  refer  to  the 
relevant guidance and amend the RMP accordingly.  
The  MAH  submitted  a  revised  RMP  to  comply  with  the  RMP  template  (EMEA/192632/2006). 
Furthermore,  the  summary  of  the  RMP  was  revised  to  summarise  routine  and  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimization measures. However, the lack of clarity with regard 
to what constitutes pharmacovigilance activities as opposed to risk minimisation measures remained.  
In  the  second  response  from  the  MAH,  the  lack  of  clarity  with  regard  to  what  constitutes 
pharmacovigilance activities as opposed to risk minimization measures was addressed. SPC and PIL 
wording  was  described  as  a  routine  risk  minimisation  measure  rather 
than  a  proposed 
pharmacovigilance  activity.  Educational  material  was  appropriately  described  as  an  additional  risk 
minimisation measure.  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to provide a DHPC providing recommendations for the 
use of Protopic ointment as maintenance therapy, including reminders covered by the current MA as 
well as all identified and potential risks with the use of Protopic ointment. The CHMP clarified that 
the final wording of the DHPC will only be agreed once the variation to permit maintenance treatment 
is approved. Therefore, the precise wording of the DHPC is not further discussed in this report. 
Following  a  request  from  the  CHMP  the  MAH  also  agreed  to  add  application  site  burning  as  an 
important identified risk in all relevant sections of the RMP. 
Regarding the detailed action plan for specific safety concerns, the MAH was requested to present the 
details of the additional measures which may be adopted on the basis of the results of the following 
actions and the decision criteria for initiating such measures in the following cases: 
•  Margolis et al (2007) case control study (non melanoma skin cancer). 
•  Mechanistic in vitro study. "Tacrolimus effect on cutaneous T cell lymphoma lymphocyte and 
dendritic cells". 
Long-term  EU  epidemiological  study  (long-term  effect  on  the  skin  with  respect  to 
malignancies). 
APPLES study – prospective paediatric longitudinal observational study. 
Long-term observational studies in Japan. 
• 
• 
• 
The MAH provided a detailed response for each of the five cases as follows: 
Margolis et a1 (2007) case control study (non melanoma skin cancer) 
The  results  of  this  case-control  study  have  shown  that  AD  patients  developing  NMSC  were  not 
exposed  more  frequently  to  TCIs  (tacrolimus  or  pimecrolimus)  than  those  not  developing  NMSC 
(controls),  suggesting  that  patients  exposed  to  TCIs  are  not  at  increased  risk  to  develop  NMSC. 
However,  the  observational  period  for  the  cases  in  this  study  was  not  long  enough  considering  the 
latency  period  of  NMSC,  and  therefore  the  authors  of  this  work  have  announced  their  intention  to 
repeat  the  study  within  a  few  years  after  this  publication  as  to  accumulate  a  longer  observational 
period. The MAH monitors the publication of the results of the planned repetition of the Margolis case 
control study on the risk of atopic dermatitis patients to develop NMSC after exposure to TCIs.  
In parallel, the MAH has proposed to the CHMP the repetition of the Drug Utilization Cohort Studies 
(DUS),  of  which  the  first  results  were  submitted  in  June  2007  and  reviewed  by  the  CHMP  in 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
September 2007. The results for the repeated case-control study and both Drug Utilization Studies are 
expected  at  the  end  of  2010.  The  risk-benefit  of  Protopic  ointment  will  be  re-assessed  again  on  the 
basis of these results.  
Mechanistic  in  vitro  study.  "Tacrolimus  effect  on  cutaneous  T  cell  lymphoma  lymphocyte  and 
dendritic cells" 
This mechanistic study was conducted and submitted to the CHMP in 2007 as part of the follow-up 
measures  committed  to  the  CHMP.  The  data  from  this  study  suggests  the  absence  of  increased 
proliferation  of  CTCL  cells  in  the  studied  model  when  exposed  to  increasing  concentrations  of 
tacrolimus in vitro. Where these results are encouraging in the efforts to demonstrate the absence of an 
increased  risk  to  develop  CTCL  in  patients  using  Protopic  ointment,  a  definitive  translation  to  the 
clinical situation cannot yet be made. The MAH did not believe that these results do require further 
measures, however, other activities initiated to address overall risk for skin malignancy (e.g. APPLES 
study, DUS studies) would be utilized to investigate the CTCL risk.  
Long-term EU epidemiological study (long-term effect on the skin with respect to malignancies)  
In March 2006, the MAH committed to propose a European epidemiological study to assess the risk of 
development  of  skin  malignancies.  Accordingly,  the  MAH  conducted,  as  an  initial  step,  two  Drug 
Utilization  Studies  in  two  well  known  European  epidemiological  institutions  (GPRD  and  Pharmo 
Institute).  As  for  the  case-control  study  mentioned  above,  the  exploratory  analysis  conducted  in  the 
frame of the DUS studies did not show an increased risk for the development of skin malignancies in 
patients  exposed  to  TCIs  (pimecrolimus,  tacrolimus).  The  observational  period  was  relatively  short 
and  therefore  the  MAH  suggested  in  September  2007,  to  repeat  the  Drug  Utilization  Studies  after  a 
few  years.  The  outcome  of  these  new  DUS’  and  the  analysis  for  increased  risk  of  cutaneous 
malignancy are expected at the end of 2010. No further measures are foreseen at this point in time. 
APPLES study - prospective paediatric longitudinal observational study 
The APPLES study is a follow-up measure requested by the CHMP to include European patients in an 
epidemiological  study  assessing  the  risk  of  lymphoma  and  skin  malignancies  in  paediatric  patients 
with atopic dermatitis exposed to Protopic ointment. The APPLES study planned for an observational 
period of 10 years for each enrolled paediatric patient, and therefore the availability of a final study 
report is expected by the end of 2018. The study analysis plan foresees an interim report by the end of 
2013. In addition, the MAH is providing to the CHMP enrolment updates twice a year.  
Long-term observational studies in Japan 
The  Japanese  long-term  observational  studies  will  be  assessed  as  other  long-term  safety  studies 
through  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  procedures  and  PSUR  during  their  execution  and  until  their 
expected conclusion in 2015.  
Regarding  the  detailed  action  plan  for  specific  safety  concerns  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  MAH 
comment that no further measures arising from the above five studies are foreseen at this point in time.  
With regard to the long-term EU epidemiological study, the need and feasibility of this study (rather 
than  repetition  of  the  DUSs)  is  currently  under  separate  regulatory  assessment.  Dependant  on  the 
outcome of this assessment, the RMP may need to be further updated in this regard. 
Risk Minimisation Plan 
It  has  been  shown  that  with  the  maintenance  treatment  there  was  less  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment 
versus  the  current  recommended  treatment  in  both  adults  and  in  children  above  2  years  of  age. 
However, because of the fact that the theoretical risk of cutaneous malignancy and lymphoma cannot 
be  ruled  out  and  the  importance  to  only  threat  the  patients  fulfilling  the  criteria  for  maintenance 
treatment  the  CHMP  considered  it  necessary  that  the  attention  of  the  prescribers  is  drawn  to  the 
importance  to  respect  these  specific  conditions  when  prescribing  Protopic  in  maintenance  therapy. 
This  would  be  done  through  a  DHPC  letter  that  could  also  be  used  as  a  reminder  of  some  of  the 
important safety concerns as described in the RMP summary table. The MAH was therefore requested 
to commit to providing a DHPC to be reviewed by the CHMP (see letter of undertaking attached to 
this report). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  Annex  7  of  the  RMP  (other  supporting  data),  a  number  of  line  listings  of  reports  of 
malignancy  reported  to  the  MAH  before  30th  September  2007  has  been  presented.  The  MAH  was 
therefore  requested  to  provide  an  analysis  of  this  data  (to  include  patient  exposure  data,  to  provide 
context). 
Following the CHMP request the MAH provided a response listing the 4 categories of malignancies 
reported.  
Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=38) 
Overall, 38 cases of Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma have been reported in 38 patients in the 
period from 1998 to 30 September 2007. Of these, 2 cases were reported in clinical studies, 22 (58%) 
were spontaneous reports and 14 (37%) were Health Authority cases. The number of cases diagnosed 
is variable from year to year, but generally there have been several additional cases every year since 
the launches in Japan (1999), the USA (2001) and Europe (2002). Reporting of cases had been stable 
for several years until a peak in 2005. This was most likely as a result of regulatory actions conducted 
in the USA and Europe in relation to topical calcineurin-inhibitors and the associated publicity. Since 
then the number of diagnosed cases has decreased  substantially where the number of cases  reported 
has returned back to the level observed in 2004. 
Twenty two (22) out of 38 cases (58%) were reported in North America (USA) and 8 (21%) in both 
Asia and in Europe (2 in UK, 2 in Spain, 2 in Finland and 1 each in Germany and Ireland). Thirty two 
(32) cases (84%) were reported in adults ≥ 18 years of age, of these 18 (47%) were in patients aged ≥ 
50 years,  and  14  patients where  aged  between  >  18  and  <  50 years;  3  patients  (8%)  where  younger 
than 18 years at time of diagnosis, and age was not known for three cases. Twenty (20) cases (52%) 
were  reported  in  male  patients.  For  those  patients  where  the  information  was  available,  the  time 
elapsed  from  1st  application  to  diagnosis  was  highly  variable  ranging  from  a  few  months  to  several 
years. The majority of the patients are adults, with almost half of the cases being reported in patients 
older than 50 years. 
CTCL, Sezary’s syndrome, Mycosis Fungoides, T-cell lymphoma in skin biopsy (n=21) 
Overall,  21  cases  of  lymphoma  in  the  skin  (CTCL,  Sezary’s  syndrome,  Mycosis  Fungoides,  T-cell 
lymphoma in skin biopsy) have been reported in 21 patients in the period from 1998 to 30 September 
2007. From these, 6 were reported in clinical studies, 9 were spontaneous reports and 6 were Health 
Authority  cases.  The  number  of  cases  diagnosed  is  variable  with  few  additional  cases  every  year. 
Reporting  has  shown  to  be  stable  until  2005  with  a  peak  in  2006  most  likely  due  to  the  regulatory 
actions  conducted  in  the  USA  and  Europe  in  that  year  in  relation  to  topical  calcineurin-inhibitors. 
Fourteen (14) cases were reported in North America (USA), 1 in Asia (Japan) and 6 in Europe (3 in 
UK, 2 in France and 1 in Spain). Seventeen cases (81%) were reported in adults≥ 18 years of age, of 
these  11  (52%)  were  in  patients  aged  ≥  50  years,  and  6  patients  were  aged  between  >  18  and  <  50 
years; 2 patients where younger than 18 years (16 and 15 years respectively) at time of diagnosis, and 
age  was  not  known  for  two  cases.  Thirteen  cases  were  reported  in  male  patients  (62%).  For  those 
patients  where  the  information  was  available,  the  time  elapsed  from  1st  application  to  lymphoma 
diagnosis  was  highly  variable  ranging  from  a  few  months  to  several  years.  Overall,  the  number  of 
cases of CTCL reported remains low and stable over the last 10 years. The majority of the patients are 
elderly  males  with  a  long  history  of  eczematous  conditions,  consistent  with  the  population  prone  to 
develop CTCL. 
Skin cancer cases (n=49) 
Overall,  53  events  of  skin  cancer  have  been  reported  in  49  patients  in  the  period  from  1998  to  30 
September 2007. From these, 22 events were reported in clinical studies, 17 were spontaneous reports 
and 10 were from a Health Authority. As before, the number of cases diagnosed is variable from year 
to year. Reporting of cases had shown to be stable until 2005 with a peak in 2006, probably due to 
regulatory actions conducted in the USA and Europe and its associated media impact. Thirty four (34) 
cases were reported in America, 3 in Asia and 12 in Europe (3 in UK, 3 in France, 2 in Sweden, and 1 
each  in  Germany,  Norway,  Ireland  and  The  Netherlands).  Forty  four  cases  (90%)  were  reported  in 
adults ≥ 18 years of age, 39 (79%) in patients aged ≥ 40 years, 3 patients where younger than 18 years 
at time of diagnosis, and age was not known for two cases. Twenty five cases were reported in male 
patients (50%). Time elapsed from 1st application to skin cancer diagnosis was highly variable ranging 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
from a few weeks to several years. Overall, the diagnosis of cases of skin malignancies remains low 
and stable over the last 10 years. The majority of the patients are aged > 40 years after which the risk 
for developing skin malignancies is known to be increased. The majority of reported cases are cases of 
SCC  (Squamous  Cell  Carcinoma)  and  BCC  (Basal  Cell  Carcinoma)  in  head,  neck,  face  or  limbs, 
regions with higher exposure to natural sunlight. Overall, the pattern of the patient’s age and type of 
malignancy  corresponds  to  what  is  known  from  the  epidemiology  of  skin  malignancies,  particularly 
NMSC. 
Other cancer cases (n=44) 
Overall, 44 events of cancer other than lymphoma or skin cancer have been reported in 44 patients in 
the period from 1998 to 30 September 2007. From these, 20 were reported in clinical studies, 17 were 
spontaneous reports and 7 were Health Authority cases. The number of cases diagnosed increased over 
time in a regular manner consistent with the increasing exposure after launch in 2001 and 2002 in the 
USA and Europe respectively. In terms of case reporting, again a peak in 2006 was observed. Twenty 
six  (26)  cases  were  reported  in  America,  4  in  Asia  and  14  in  Europe  (2  in  UK,  3  in  France,  5  in 
Germany, 3 in The Netherlands and 1 in Spain). Thirty three cases (75%) were reported in adults ≥ 18 
years of age, 18 (41%) in patients aged ≥ 50 years, 8 patients where children younger than 18 years, 
and age was not known for three cases. Twenty one cases were reported in male patients (48%). Also 
in this case time elapsed from 1st application to cancer diagnosis was highly variable ranging from a 
few  weeks  to  several  years.  Overall,  the  age  of  the  patients  and  the  type  of  malignancy  reported 
correspond  well  to  what  is  expected  from  the  normal  population.  From  the  8  children  reporting  a 
malignancy,  4  were  leukaemias.  When  comparing  the  number  of  cases  diagnosed  and  reported  for 
each type of malignancy to the overall exposure to the drug as presented in the current version of the 
RMP and the PSURs, the accrual of cases reported does appear to follow reasonably well the increase 
in overall exposure since marketing. 
Overall, the MAH believed that for all 4 categories of malignancies presented, the number and pattern 
of reporting is in line with what could be expected from the normal population. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  MAH  response  and  commented  that  the  analysis  requested  related  to 
tables 55, 56 and 57 of Annex 7 i.e. those involving lymphoma and skin cancers, although the MAH 
has also provided an analysis regarding malignancies other than skin and lymphomas. These reports 
would  have  been  included  and  assessed  in  the  clinical  study  reports  and  in  the  regular  PSURs 
submitted. Risk of cutaneous malignancy and lymphoma are characterised as important potential risks 
and  are  subject  to  additional  pharmacovigilance  measures  (expedited  reporting  of  malignancies 
irrespective  of  causality  and  ongoing  and  completed  post  marketing  studies  as  agreed  follow-up 
measures).  The  SPC  and  PL  contain  information  regarding  risk  of  malignancy  and  post-marketing 
reports (causality not addressed in the SPC and neither confirmed nor refuted in the PL). The MAH 
was therefore requested to:  
−  Provide exposure data 
−  Clarify  why  reports  of  malignancy  from  clinical  trials  have  not  been  reflected  in  the  product 
information. 
−  Provide the CIOMS reports for the cases described (including reporter/ investigator assessment 
of causality). 
In response, the MAH provided available information on exposure to tacrolimus as retrieved from the 
reviewed  CIOMS  forms.  The  review  of  CIOMS  information  on  estimated  treatment  duration  for 
reported cases of malignancy (lymphoma, CTCL, other skin malignancies) did not show a trend for an 
increased  reporting  of  any  of  these  malignancies  with  increasing  treatment  duration.  Considered 
together, the MAH was of the opinion that, although sometimes scarce, the information available on 
treatment durations from reported cases of malignancies is consistent with the previous position of the 
MAH that it is likely that many of these events were either pre-existing lesions that became evident 
when  the  skin  was  cleared  of  AR,  were  cases  of  CTCL  misdiagnosed  as  AD  at  the  time  of 
prescription, or represent events occurring at the background rate for the underlying disorder. 
The MAH believed that the information available from treatment durations recorded from malignancy 
cases reported to the global safety database for Protopic do not support a causal link between treatment 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
duration/exposure and development of lymphoma or skin malignancy including CTCL, and does not 
provide evidence that prolonged treatment periods with Protopic translate into increased reporting of 
malignancy. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH conclusion.

version of the Protopic Risk Management Plan dated 21 January 2009.

•  DHPC letter  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  Pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities  were 
sufficient.  No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  apart  from  the  DHPC  letter  were  considered 
needed.  
II.  OVERALL CONCLUSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT  
It is estimated that moderate-to-severe AD patients have frequent disease exacerbations and that they 
spend  on  average  112–192  days  per  year  with  active  disease  (Zuberbier  et  al,  2006).  After 
discontinuation of treatment, AD flares commonly reoccur after approximately 14 days (Reitamo et al, 
2002) therefore it would appear that this condition is not optimally managed. 
The  efficacy  results  of  the  CONTROL  studies  show  that  patients  experienced  fewer  disease 
exacerbations,  a  longer  time  to  their  next  disease  exacerbation  and  longer  disease-free  periods. 
Although  the  safety  of  maintenance  therapy  with  tacrolimus  ointment  has  not  been  formally 
investigated  beyond  12  months  of  treatment,  studies  conducted  with  the  intermittent  twice  daily 
regimen for up to 4 years have no shown any evidence for development of lymphoma or CTCL. 
It  is  known  that  in  the  early  stages  patches  of  CTCL  resemble  eczema,  psoriasis,  and  contact 
dermatitis. It may also respond favourably to the topical treatments prescribed for these skin disorders. 
This is unfortunate as the disease may be missed or misdiagnosed as a benign condition and the patient 
may be untreated for years. CTCL is most likely discovered when a physician maintains a degree of 
suspicion  about  the  disease,  performs  multiple  skin  biopsies,  and  provides  close  follow-up  after  the 
initial presentation. The MAH has shown that an intact stratum corneum is the rate limiting barrier to 
tacrolimus absorption and during a disease exacerbation (AD Flare) there is a 7 fold higher rate of skin 
absorption  compared  with  normal  skin.  The  MAH  has  also  provided  evidence  that  as  skin  heals  the 
amount  of  tacrolimus  absorption  decreases  over  time  and  with  the  proposed  maintenance  regimen 
there is little or no skin accumulation of tacrolimus. 
In  relation  to  drug  usage  the  control  studies  have  shown  that  both  adults  and  children  used  less 
tacrolimus  ointment  during  a  disease  exacerbation  when  maintenance  treatment  was  used  versus  the 
current  regime  (vehicle).  While  the  amounts  of  tacrolimus  ointment  used  during  the  study  for  both 
treatment  regimens  were  comparable  for  adults,  an  increase  amount  was  seen  in  children.  However,  
this  is  not  fully  accurate  as  there  was  a  higher  drop  out  rate  in  patients  treated  with  the  currently 
approved  regimen  (vehicle)  versus  maintenance  treatment  therefore  taking  this  into  account  the 
amount  of  tacrolimus  ointment  use  per  day  during  the  DCP  was  calculated.  It  has  been  shown  that 
with  maintenance  treatment  there  was  less  use  of  tacrolimus  ointment  (g/day)  versus  current 
recommended  treatment.  An  additional  study  (FG-506-30)  has  concluded  that  96%  of  tacrolimus 
ointment is cleared at 96 hours after the last application of the ointment, indicating that there was no 
sustained  retention  of  tacrolimus  in  epidermis/dermis.  As  the  maintenance  treatment  is  proposed  for 
once daily twice weekly no accumulation of tacrolimus would be expected to occur. 
The MAH also provided an update on the clinical trials investigating long term safety which included 
an  update  from  the  APPLES  study  and  the  DUS.  Neither  of  these  studies  has  reported  an  increased 
rate of CTCL or lymphoma. The MAH has proposed to re-run the DUS as conducted in 2007, in two 
representative epidemiological databases in Europe to assess the risk of developing skin malignancies.

This repetition should ensure that patients included in the different cohorts have a minimum follow-up 
period  of  5  years.  In  addition,  the  MAH  has  provided  a  thorough  answer  of  the  issues  raised  and 
examined and discussed the actual evidence to date for the risk of developing CTCL and lymphoma, 
the  potential  risks  of  tacrolimus  exposure  to  both  the  skin  and  systemic  compartments  using  both 
treatment regimens, given an update of ongoing and future studies. 
The current licensed indications do not specify the frequency or duration of treatment as patients can 
be  treated  as  often  as  they  experience  a  flare.  The  purpose  of  this  type  II  variation  was  to  examine 
whether there is an increased risk with the proposed maintenance treatment versus the current licensed 
treatment regimen, as distinct from a full benefit risk assessment. 
The current evidence suggests that exposure to tacrolimus will be less during maintenance treatment 
compared  with  the  current  licensed  regimen  as  amount  of  tacrolimus  used  is  less  and  absorption  of 
tacrolimus  is  7  fold  lower  with  an  intact  stratum  corneum  compared  with  inflamed  skin.  It  is  also 
apparent  that  AD  may  commonly  reflare  14  days  after  discontinuation  of  treatment.  The  proposed 
posology,  of  once  daily  for  2  days  per  week,  will  minimise  skin  exposure  and  accumulation  of 
tacrolimus. 
Currently  there  is  no  evidence  of  tacrolimus  causing  an  immune  system  dysfunction.  Taking  the 
available  evidence  into  consideration  it  does  not  appears  that  there  is  an  increased  risk  (apparent  or 
potential) with maintenance treatment versus the current treatment and overall it may be a safer way of 
treating patients as they appear to have lower  tacrolimus exposure. It was the CHMP opinion that all 
of the available evidence supports the use of maintenance treatment for tacrolimus.  
The  CHMP  therefore  recommended  that  this  variation  is  approvable  and  the  amended  changes 
proposed for the SPC are endorsed. 
III.  CONCLUSION 
On 22 January 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

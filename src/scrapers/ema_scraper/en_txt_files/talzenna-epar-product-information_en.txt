CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Breast cancer 
Talzenna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline 
BRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant, locally 
advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments (see section 5.1). 
Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a prior 
endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy. 
Prostate cancer 
Talzenna is indicated in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in whom chemotherapy is not clinically 
indicated. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Talzenna should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Patient selection 
Breast cancer 
Patients should be selected for the treatment of breast cancer with Talzenna based on the presence of 
deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations determined by an experienced 
laboratory using a validated test method.  
Genetic counselling for patients with BRCA mutations should be performed according to local 
regulations, as applicable. 
Prostate cancer 
There is no requirement for tumour mutation testing for selection of patients with mCRPC for 
treatment with Talzenna. 
Posology 
Talzenna monotherapy (breast cancer)  
The recommended dose is 1 mg talazoparib once daily. Patients should be treated until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Talzenna in combination with enzalutamide (prostate cancer) 
The recommended dose is 0.5 mg talazoparib in combination with 160 mg enzalutamide once daily. 
Patients should be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Medical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be 
continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
Please refer to the full enzalutamide product information for the recommended posology. 
Missing dose 
If the patient vomits or misses a dose of Talzenna, an additional dose should not be taken. The next 
prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time.  
Dose adjustments 
To manage adverse drug reactions, interruption of treatment or dose reduction based on severity and 
clinical presentation should be considered (see Table 1). Recommended dose reduction levels for 
talazoparib monotherapy (breast cancer) and for talazoparib when used in combination with 
enzalutamide (prostate cancer) are indicated in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. 
Complete blood count should be obtained prior to starting talazoparib therapy and monitored monthly 
and as clinically indicated (see Table 1 and section 4.4).

Please refer to the full enzalutamide product information for dose adjustment for adverse reactions 
associated with enzalutamide. 
The intended use of the 0.1 mg capsule is to support dose modifications and it is not interchangeable 
with other strengths.  
Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
Talzenna monotherapy (breast cancer) 
Strong inhibitors of P-gp may lead to increased talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong P-gp 
inhibitors during treatment with talazoparib should be avoided. Co-administration should only be 
considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If co-administration with a 
strong P-gp inhibitor is unavoidable, the Talzenna dose should be reduced to the next lower dose. 
When the strong P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, the Talzenna dose should be increased (after 
3-5 half-lives of the P-gp inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong P-gp inhibitor 
(see section 4.5). 
Talzenna when used in combination with enzalutamide (prostate cancer) 
The effect of co-administration of P-gp inhibitors on talazoparib exposure when talazoparib is given in 
combination with enzalutamide has not been studied. Therefore, concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors 
during treatment with talazoparib should be avoided (see section 4.5).  
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1 × upper 
limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 
1.5 × ULN and any AST), moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any 
AST), or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2). 
Talzenna in combination with enzalutamide is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impairment (Child-Pugh classification C), as pharmacokinetics and safety have not been established in 
these patients (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
Breast cancer 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ creatinine 
clearance [CrCL] < 90 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal impairment 
(30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), the recommended starting dose of Talzenna is 0.75 mg once daily. 
For patients with severe renal impairment (15 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 30 mL/min), the recommended 
starting dose of Talzenna is 0.5 mg once daily. Talzenna has not been studied in patients with 
CrCL < 15 mL/min or patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2).  
Prostate cancer 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ creatinine 
clearance [CrCL] < 90 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal impairment 
(30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), the recommended dose of Talzenna is 0.35 mg once daily in 
combination with enzalutamide orally once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment 
(15 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 30 mL/min), the recommended dose of Talzenna is 0.25 mg once daily in 
combination with enzalutamide once daily. Talzenna has not been studied in patients with 
CrCL < 15 mL/min or patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2).  
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Talzenna in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Talzenna is for oral use. To avoid contact with the capsule content, the capsules should be swallowed 
whole, and must not be opened or dissolved. They can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression  
Myelosuppression consisting of anaemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, have 
been reported in patients treated with talazoparib (see section 4.8). Talazoparib should not be started 
until patients have recovered from haematological toxicity caused by previous therapy (≤ Grade 1). 
Precautions should be taken to routinely monitor haematology parameters and signs and symptoms 
associated with anaemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia in patients receiving 
talazoparib. If such events occur, dose modifications (reduction or interruption) are recommended (see 
section 4.2). Supportive care with or without blood and/or platelet transfusions and/or administration 
of colony stimulating factors may be used as appropriate.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients 
who received poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including 
talazoparib. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in < 1% of solid tumour patients treated with 
talazoparib in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Potential contributing factors for the development of 
MDS/AML include previous platinum-containing chemotherapy, other DNA damaging agents or 
radiotherapy. Complete blood counts should be obtained at baseline and monitored monthly for signs 
of haematologic toxicity during treatment. If MDS/AML is confirmed, talazoparib should be 
discontinued. 
Venous thromboembolic events  
In patients with mCRPC a higher incidence of venous thromboembolic events was observed with 
Talzenna in combination with enzalutamide compared with enzalutamide alone. Patients should be 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and 
treated as medically appropriate (see section 4.8). 
Contraception in women of childbearing potential 
Talazoparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats but not mutagenic in Ames 
assay (see section 5.3), and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant 
women should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus (see section 4.6). Women of childbearing 
potential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should not be pregnant at the 
beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential 
prior to treatment. 
A highly effective method of contraception is required for female patients during treatment with 
Talzenna, and for at least 7 months after completing therapy. Since the use of hormonal contraception 
is not recommended in patients with breast cancer, two non-hormonal and complementary 
contraception methods should be used (see section 4.6).  
Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or pregnant partners should be advised to 
use effective contraception (even after vasectomy), during treatment with Talzenna and for at least 
4 months after the final dose. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Talazoparib is a substrate for drug transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and 
it is mainly eliminated by renal clearance as unchanged compound. 
Agents that may affect talazoparib plasma concentrations 
P-gp inhibitors  
Effect of enzalutamide 
Co-administration with 160 mg enzalutamide increases talazoparib exposure approximately 2-fold. 
Administration of talazoparib 0.5 mg daily in combination with enzalutamide achieves approximately 
the same steady-state trough (Ctrough) concentration reported for talazoparib 1 mg daily (see 
section 5.2). When Talzenna is co-administered with enzalutamide, the Talzenna starting dose is 
0.5 mg (see section 4.2). The interaction effect of doses other than 160 mg enzalutamide on 
talazoparib has not been quantified. 
The effect of co-administration of other P-gp inhibitors on talazoparib exposure when talazoparib is 
given in combination with enzalutamide has not been studied. If co-administration of P-gp inhibitors 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cannot be avoided, when Talzenna is given with enzalutamide, the patient should be monitored for 
potential increased adverse reactions. 
Effect of other P-gp inhibitors 
Data from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that 
co-administration of multiple daily doses of a P-gp inhibitor, itraconazole 100 mg twice daily with a 
single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose increased talazoparib total exposure (AUCinf) and peak concentration 
(Cmax) by approximately 56% and 40%, respectively, relative to a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose 
administered alone. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis has also shown that concomitant use of 
strong P-gp inhibitors increased talazoparib exposure by 45%, relative to talazoparib given alone.  
Concomitant use of strong P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to amiodarone, carvedilol, 
clarithromycin, cobicistat, darunavir, dronedarone, erythromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lapatinib, lopinavir, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, 
tipranavir, and verapamil) should be avoided. If co-administration with a strong P-gp inhibitor is 
unavoidable, the Talzenna dose should be reduced (see section 4.2). 
P-gp inducers  
Data from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumours indicated that 
co-administration of single 1 mg talazoparib dose with multiple daily doses of a P-gp inducer, rifampin 
600 mg, with rifampin co-administered 30 minutes before talazoparib on the day of talazoparib dosing, 
increased talazoparib Cmax by approximately 37% whereas AUCinf was not affected relative to a single 
1 mg talazoparib dose administered alone. This is probably the net effect of both P-gp induction and 
inhibition by rifampin under the tested conditions in the drug-drug interaction study. No talazoparib 
dose adjustments are required when co-administered with rifampin. However, the effect of other P-gp 
inducers on talazoparib exposure has not been studied. Other P-gp inducers (including but not limited to 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort) may decrease talazoparib exposure.  
BCRP inhibitors  
The effect of BCRP inhibitors on PK of talazoparib has not been studied in vivo. Co-administration of 
talazoparib with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure. Concomitant use of strong 
BCRP inhibitors (including but not limited to curcumin and cyclosporine) should be avoided. If 
co-administration of strong BCRP inhibitors cannot be avoided, patient should be monitored for 
potential increased adverse reactions. 
Effect of acid-reducing agents 
Population PK analysis indicates that co-administration of acid-reducing agents including proton 
pump inhibitors and histamine receptor 2 antagonists (H2RA), or other acid-reducing agents had no 
significant impact on the absorption of talazoparib. 
Systemic hormonal contraception 
Drug-drug interaction studies between talazoparib and oral contraceptives have not been conducted. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while receiving Talzenna and should 
not be pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of 
childbearing potential prior to treatment (see section 4.4). 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective forms of contraception (see section 4.4) 
prior to starting treatment with talazoparib, during treatment, and for 7 months after stopping 
treatment with talazoparib. Since the use of hormonal contraception is not recommended in patients 
with breast cancer, two non-hormonal and complementary contraception methods should be used. 
Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or pregnant partners should be advised to 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use effective contraception (even after vasectomy) during treatment with Talzenna, and for at least 
4 months after the final dose (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Talzenna in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Talzenna may cause foetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Talzenna is not recommended during pregnancy or for women of childbearing 
potential not using contraception (see section 4.4).  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether talazoparib is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to breast-fed children 
cannot be excluded and therefore breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Talzenna 
and for at least 1 month after the final dose.  
Fertility 
There is no information on fertility in patients. Based on non-clinical findings in testes (partially 
reversible) and ovary (reversible), Talzenna may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see 
section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Talzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue/asthenia or 
dizziness may occur following administration of talazoparib.  
When Talzenna is given in combination with enzalutamide, please also refer to the full enzalutamide 
product information for the effects of enzalutamide on ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
The overall safety profile of Talzenna is based on pooled data from 1088 patients, including 
690 patients who received talazoparib monotherapy at 1 mg daily in clinical studies for solid tumours 
and 398 patients with mCRPC who received talazoparib 0.5 mg in combination with enzalutamide 
160 mg in the TALAPRO-2 study.  
The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions in patients receiving talazoparib in these clinical studies 
were anaemia (55.6%), fatigue (52.5%), nausea (35.8%), neutropenia (30.3%), thrombocytopenia 
(25.2%) and decreased appetite (21.1%). The most common (≥ 10%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions of 
talazoparib were anaemia (39.2%), neutropenia (16.5%) and thrombocytopenia (11.1%). 
Dose modifications (dose reductions or dose interruptions) due to any adverse reaction occurred in 
58.7% of patients receiving Talzenna 1 mg monotherapy. The most common adverse reactions leading 
to dose modifications were anaemia (33.5%), neutropenia (11.7%) and thrombocytopenia (9.9%). 
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.9% of patients receiving Talzenna; 
the most common was anaemia (0.6%). The median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range 0.0 to 
70.2).  
Dose interruptions of Talzenna due to adverse reactions occurred in 62.1% of patients with mCRPC 
receiving Talzenna in combination with enzalutamide; the most common was anaemia (44%). Dose 
reductions of Talzenna due to adverse reactions occurred in 52.8% of patients; the most common was 
anaemia (43.2%). Permanent discontinuation of Talzenna due to adverse reactions occurred in 18.8% 
of patients; the most common was anaemia (8.3%). The median duration of talazoparib exposure was 
86 weeks (range 0.29 to 186.14).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myelosuppression 
Myelosuppression-related adverse reactions of anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were very 
commonly reported in patients treated with talazoparib. Grade 3 and Grade 4 
myelosuppression-related events were reported for anaemia in 37.8% and 1.5% of patients, 
neutropenia in 15.0% and 1.6%, and thrombocytopenia in 8.1% and 3.0%. No deaths were reported 
due to myelosuppression-related adverse reactions.  
In monotherapy studies (1 mg/day population), the most frequent myelosuppression-related adverse 
events associated with dose modifications were anaemia (33.5%), neutropenia (11.7%) and 
thrombocytopenia (9.9%) reported for up to approximately 30% of patients in the talazoparib 
1 mg/day population and the one associated with permanent study drug discontinuation was anaemia 
reported in 0.6% of patients. 
In patients with mCRPC treated with talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide, anaemia led to 
talazoparib dose interruption in 44.0% of patients, decreased neutrophil count in 13.6%, and decreased 
platelet count in 7.8%. Overall, 42.5% of patients required blood transfusions. The most common 
blood transfusion was of packed red blood cells 39.2%. Discontinuation due to anaemia, neutropenia 
and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 8.3%, 3.3% and 0.5% of patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience of overdose with talazoparib. No adverse reactions were reported in one 
patient who accidentally self-administered thirty 1 mg capsules of talazoparib on Day 1 and was 
immediately treated with gastric decontamination. Symptoms of overdose are not established. In the 
event of overdose, treatment with talazoparib should be stopped, and physicians should consider 
gastric decontamination, follow general supportive measures and treat symptomatically.

Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1 (IC50=0.7 nM), and PARP2 (IC50=0.3 nM). 
PARP enzymes are involved in cellular DNA damage response signalling pathways such as DNA 
repair, gene transcription, and cell death. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer 
cells by 2 mechanisms, inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and by PARP trapping, whereby PARP 
protein bound to a PARPi does not readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing DNA repair, 
replication, and transcription, thereby resulting in apoptosis and/or cell death. Treatment of cancer cell 
lines that are harbouring defects in DNA repair genes with talazoparib single agent leads to increased 
levels of γH2AX, a marker of double stranded DNA breaks, and results in decreased cell proliferation 
and increased apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumour activity was also observed in a patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) BRCA mutant breast cancer model where the patient was previously treated with a 
platinum-based regimen, as well as in an androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer xenograft 
model. In these PDX models talazoparib decreased tumour growth and increased γH2AX level and 
apoptosis in the tumours.  
The anti-tumour effects of combined inhibition of PARP and AR activity is based on the following 
mechanisms: AR signalling inhibition suppresses the expression of homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) genes including BRCA1, resulting in sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PARP1 activity has been 
shown to be required for maximal AR function and thus inhibiting PARP may reduce AR signalling 
and increase sensitivity to AR signalling inhibitors. Clinical resistance to AR blockade is sometimes 
associated with co-deletion of RB1 and BRCA2, which is in turn associated with sensitivity to PARP 
inhibition. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarisation was evaluated using time-matched 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) in assessing the relationship between the change of the QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) from baseline and the corresponding plasma talazoparib concentrations 
in 37 patients with advanced solid tumours. Talazoparib did not have a clinically relevant effect on 
QTc prolongation at the maximum clinically recommended monotherapy dose of 1 mg once daily. 
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
EMBRACA study 
EMBRACA was an open-label, randomised, parallel, 2-arm multicentre study of Talzenna versus 
chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) in patients with germline 
BRCA-mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received no more 
than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients 
were required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless 
contraindicated) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and/or metastatic setting. Patients with prior platinum 
therapy for advanced disease were required to have no evidence of disease progression during 
platinum therapy. No prior treatment with a PARPi was permitted.  
Of the 431 patients randomised in the EMBRACA study, 408 (95%) were centrally confirmed to have 
a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm using a clinical trial assay; out of which 354 (82%) 
were confirmed using the BRACAnalysis CDx®. BRCA mutation status (breast cancer susceptibility 
gene 1 [BRCA1] positive or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 [BRCA2] positive) was similar across 
both treatment arms.

A total of 431 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Talzenna 1 mg capsules once daily or 
chemotherapy at standard doses until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Of the 431 patients 
randomised onto EMBRACA, 287 were randomised to the Talzenna arm and 144 to the chemotherapy 
arm. Randomisation was stratified by prior use of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (0 versus 1, 2, 
or 3), by triple-negative disease status (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC] versus non-TNBC), and 
history of central nervous system metastasis (yes versus no).  
Patient demographic, baseline, and disease characteristics were generally similar between the study 
treatment arms (see Table 5).

The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central 
review (BICR). The secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), 
safety, and PK.  
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS, the primary efficacy outcome, 
for Talzenna compared with chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant effect on OS at the 
time of final OS analysis. Efficacy data for EMBRACA are summarised in Table 6. The Kaplan-Meier 
curves for PFS and OS are displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 3, respectively.

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
TALAPRO-2 study  
TALAPRO-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients (N=805) 
with mCRPC were randomised 1:1 to receive Talzenna 0.5 mg once daily in combination with 
enzalutamide 160 mg once daily, versus a comparator arm of placebo in combination with 
enzalutamide 160 mg once daily. All patients received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy and needed to have progressed on prior androgen deprivation 
therapy. Prior treatment with abiraterone or taxane-based chemotherapy for metastatic 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) was permitted. 
Randomisation was stratified by (1) previous treatment with abiraterone or taxane-based 
chemotherapy versus no such prior treatment; and by (2) HRR gene mutation status which was 
prospectively tested by next generation sequencing of tumour tissue using FoundationOne® CDx or 
circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) using FoundationOne Liquid® CDx; patients with tumour HRR 
gene mutations (ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, 
PALB2, or RAD51C) versus patients without tumour HRR gene mutations or with unknown status. 
The median age was 71 years (range 36 to 91) in both arms; 62% were White, 31% were Asian, and 
2% were Black. Most participants (66%) in both arms had an ECOG performance status of 0. In 
patients treated with Talzenna, the proportion of patients with RECIST 1.1 measurable disease at 
baseline per BICR was 30%. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of patients had received prior abiraterone or 
taxane-based chemotherapy. Twenty percent (20%) had tumours with HRR gene mutations and 80% 
had tumours that did not have HRR gene mutations or had an unknown status.  
The primary efficacy outcome was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) evaluated according 
to RECIST version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3) 
(bone) criteria, as assessed by BICR. OS was an alpha-controlled secondary endpoint.  
A statistically significant improvement in BICR-assessed rPFS was demonstrated for Talzenna in 
combination with enzalutamide compared to placebo in combination with enzalutamide. A sensitivity 
analysis of investigator-assessed rPFS was consistent with the BICR-assessed rPFS results.  
Efficacy results of TALAPRO-2 are provided in Table 7 and Figure 4.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
talazoparib in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer and prostate cancer (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Talazoparib exposure generally increased proportionally with dose across the range of 0.025 mg to 
2 mg after daily administration of multiple doses. Following repeated daily dosing of 1 mg talazoparib 
monotherapy to breast cancer patients, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of talazoparib at steady-state was in the range of 126 (107) ng•hr/mL to 208 (37) ng•hr/mL and 
11 (90) ng/mL to 19 (27) ng/mL, respectively. After oral administration of 0.5 mg talazoparib once 
daily in combination with enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC, the geometric mean (CV%) 
steady-state Ctrough across visits ranged from 3.29 to 3.68 ng/mL (45 to 48%), which is similar to the 
observed values of 3.53 (61%) ng/mL when talazoparib monotherapy was administered at 1 mg once 
daily in breast cancer patients. Following repeated daily dosing, talazoparib plasma concentrations 
reached steady-state within 2 to 3 weeks when administered alone, and approximately within 9 weeks 
when co-administered with enzalutamide. The median accumulation ratio of talazoparib following 
repeated oral administration of 1 mg monotherapy once daily was in the range of 2.3 to 5.2. 
Talazoparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP transporters. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of talazoparib, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) was generally between 
1 to 2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability study has not been conducted in humans. 
However, based on urinary excretion data the absolute bioavailability is at least 41% with fraction 
absorbed of at least 69% (see Elimination). No significant effect of acid-reducing agents on 
talazoparib exposure is expected, given sufficient solubility of talazoparib at all pHs between 1 and 
6.8. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of the patients in the pivotal study were taking acid-reducing agents, 
mainly proton pump inhibitors.  
The effect of food 
Food intake decreased the rate but not the extent of talazoparib absorption. Following a single oral 
dose of talazoparib with high-fat, high-calorie food (approximately 827 calories, 57% fat), the mean 
Cmax of talazoparib was decreased by approximately 46%, the median Tmax was delayed from 1 to 
4 hours, while the AUCinf was not affected. Based on these results, Talzenna can be administered with 
or without food (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
The population mean apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of talazoparib was 420 L. In vitro, 
talazoparib is approximately 74% bound to plasma proteins with no concentration dependence over 
the concentration range of 0.01 µM to 1 µM. Renal or hepatic impairment does not appear to impact 
talazoparib protein binding as there was no obvious trend in the mean talazoparib fraction of unbound 
drug (fu) in human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function or hepatic function. 
Biotransformation 
Talazoparib undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism in humans. Following oral administration of a 
single 1 mg dose of [14C]talazoparib to humans, no major circulating metabolites were identified in 
plasma, and talazoparib was the only circulating drug-derived entity identified. No metabolites that 
individually represented more than 10% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine or faeces.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro, talazoparib was not an inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
In vitro, talazoparib did not inhibit any of the major intestinal, hepatic or renal membrane transporters 
(P-gp, BCRP, organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP]1B1, OATP1B3, organic cationic 
transporter [OCT]1, OCT2, organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, bile salt export pump [BSEP], 
multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE]1 and MATE2-K) at clinically relevant concentrations.  
In vitro, talazoparib did not inhibit any of the major uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) isoforms (1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15) at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Elimination 
Renal elimination of unchanged drug (passive filtration and active secretion) is the major route of 
talazoparib elimination. P-gp is likely involved in talazoparib active renal secretion. The mean 
(±standard deviation) terminal plasma half-life of talazoparib was 90 (±58) hours and the population 
mean (inter-subject variability) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 6.5 (31%) L/h in cancer patients. 
In 6 female patients given a single oral dose of [14C]talazoparib, a mean of 69% (±8.6%) and 20% 
(±5.5%) of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. 
Excretion of unchanged talazoparib in urine was the major route of elimination accounting for 55% of 
the administered dose, while unchanged talazoparib recovered in the faeces accounted for 14%. 
Special populations 
Age, sex, and body weight 
A population PK analysis was conducted using data from 490 patients with cancer who received 
talazoparib 1 mg daily as monotherapy to evaluate the impact of age (ranging from 18 to 88 years), 
sex (53 males and 437 females), and body weight (ranging from 35.7 kg to 162 kg) on the PK of 
talazoparib. The results have shown that age, sex, and body weight had no clinically relevant effect on 
the PK of talazoparib. 
Race 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients who received talazoparib 1 mg daily as 
monotherapy, where 41 patients were Asian and 449 patients were Non-Asian (361 White, 16 Black, 
9 Others, and 63 Not reported), talazoparib CL/F was higher in Asian patients compared to Non-Asian 
patients, leading to 19% lower exposure (AUC) in Asian patients. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics of talazoparib have not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age.  
Renal impairment 
Talazoparib monotherapy 
Data from a PK trial in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment indicated 
that talazoparib total exposure (AUC0-24) after multiple talazoparib once daily doses increased by 92% 
and 169% in patients with moderate (eGFR 30 – < 60 mL/min) and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) renal 
impairment, respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min). 
Talazoparib Cmax increased by 90% and 107% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, 
respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function. Talazoparib exposure was similar for 
patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 – < 90 mL/min) and those with normal renal function. 
In addition, based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients, where 132 patients had mild 
renal impairment (60 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 90 mL/min), 33 patients had moderate renal impairment 
(30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), and 1 patient had severe renal impairment 
(CrCL < 30 mL/min),talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 14% and 37% in patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment, corresponding to 17% and 59% increase in AUC, respectively, when 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to patients with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). The PK of talazoparib have not 
been studied in patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Talazoparib co-administered with enzalutamide 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 412 mCRPC patients who received talazoparib 
co-administered with enzalutamide, where 152 patients had mild renal impairment (60 mL/min 
≤ CrCL < 90 mL/min), 72 patients had moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCL < 60 mL/min), 
and 2 patients had severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min), talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 
8% and 27%, corresponding to increases of 9% and 37% in AUC, in patients with mild and moderate 
renal impairment respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. The PK of talazoparib 
has not been studied in patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Talazoparib monotherapy 
Based on a population PK analysis that included 490 patients who received talazoparib 1 mg daily as 
monotherapy, where 118 patients had mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 × ULN and AST 
> ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on 
the PK of talazoparib. The PK of talazoparib in patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic 
impairment, moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN and any AST) was studied in a PK trial. Population 
PK analysis using data from this PK trial indicated that mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment had no 
significant impact on the PK of talazoparib (see section 4.2).  
Talazoparib co-administered with enzalutamide 
The PK of talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with talazoparib. 
Genotoxicity 
Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. Talazoparib was clastogenic 
in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo 
micronucleus assay in rats at exposures similar to clinically relevant doses. This clastogenicity is 
consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of talazoparib, indicating 
the potential for genotoxicity in humans. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and in dogs, the main findings at subtherapeutic exposures 
included bone marrow hypocellularity with dose-dependent decrease in haematopoietic cells, depletion 
of lymphoid tissue in multiple organs and atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes, epididymis 
and seminiferous tubules. Additional findings at higher exposures included dose-dependent increase in 
apoptosis/necrosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and ovary. Most of the histopathologic 
findings were generally reversible while the testes findings were partially reversible after 4 weeks of 
dosing cessation. These toxicity findings are consistent with the pharmacology of talazoparib and its 
tissue distribution  pattern.  
Developmental toxicology 
In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, talazoparib resulted in  embryo-foetal death, foetal 
malformation (depressed eye bulge, small eye, split sternebrae, fused cervical vertebral arch) and 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structural variations in bones at a  maternal systemic AUC24 exposure approximately 0.09-fold the 
relevant human exposure at the  recommended dose.

1.  What Talzenna is and what it is used for 
What Talzenna is and how it works 
Talzenna contains the active substance talazoparib. It is a type of anticancer medicine known as a 
‘PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor’.  
Talzenna works by blocking PARP, which is an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA in certain cancer 
cells. As a result, the cancer cells can no longer repair themselves and they die. 
What Talzenna is used for 
Talzenna is a medicine used  
- 
alone to treat adults with breast cancer of a type known as HER2-negative breast cancer who 
have an abnormal inherited BRCA gene. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make 
sure that Talzenna is right for you. 
in combination with a medicine called enzalutamide, to treat adults with prostate cancer who no 
longer respond to a hormone therapy or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. 
- 
Talzenna is used when the cancer has spread beyond the original tumour or to other parts of the body. 
If you have any questions about how Talzenna works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Talzenna  
Do not take Talzenna 
- 
If you are allergic to talazoparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Talzenna and during your treatment if you 
experience signs or symptoms described in this section. 
Low blood cell counts 
Talzenna lowers your blood cell counts, such as your red blood cell count (anaemia), white blood cell 
count (neutropenia), or blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Signs and symptoms you need to 
look out for include: 
- 
Anaemia: Being short of breath, feeling very tired, pale skin, or fast heartbeat – these may be 
signs of a low red blood cell count. 
Neutropenia: Infection, developing chills or shivering, or fever – these may be signs of a low 
white blood cell count. 
Thrombocytopenia: Bruising or bleeding for longer than usual if you hurt yourself – these may 
be signs of a low blood platelet count. 
- 
- 
You will have regular blood tests during treatment with Talzenna to check your blood cells (white 
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). 
Serious problems with the bone marrow  
Rarely, low blood cell counts may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Your doctor may want to test 
your bone marrow to check for these problems. 
Blood clots 
Talzenna may cause blood clots in the veins. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience 
signs or symptoms of blood clots in the veins such as pain or stiffness, swelling and redness in the 
affected leg (or arm), chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness. 
Male and female contraception 
Women who can become pregnant and men with partners who are or can become pregnant should use 
effective contraception.  
Please see section “Male and female contraception” below. 
Children and adolescents 
Talzenna is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). 
Other medicines and Talzenna 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Talzenna can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some medicines can affect the 
way Talzenna works. 
In particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with Talzenna: 
- 
Amiodarone, carvedilol, dronedarone, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine and verapamil – 
generally used to treat heart problems. 
Clarithromycin and erythromycin antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections. 
Itraconazole and ketoconazole – used to treat fungal infections. 
Cobicistat, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir and tipranavir used to 
treat HIV infections/AIDS. 
Ciclosporin – used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Lapatinib – used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer. 
Curcumin (e.g. found in turmeric root) in some medicines (see also section Talzenna with food 
and drink below). 
The following medicines may reduce the effect of Talzenna: 
- 
- 
Carbamazepine and phenytoin – anti-epileptics used to treat seizures or fits. 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) – a herbal remedy used to treat mild depression and 
anxiety. 
Talzenna with food and drink 
Do not use curcumin in food supplements while you are taking Talzenna as it may increase Talzenna’s 
side effects. Curcumin is found in turmeric root and you should not use large amounts of turmeric 
root, but using spices in food is not likely to cause a problem. 
Pregnancy 
Talzenna could harm an unborn baby. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. Your doctor will perform a pregnancy test prior to starting Talzenna. 
- 
- 
- 
You should not use Talzenna if you are pregnant. 
You should not become pregnant while taking Talzenna. 
Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may 
become pregnant.  
Male and female contraception 
Women who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during 
treatment with Talzenna and for at least 7 months after the last dose of Talzenna. Since the use of 
hormonal contraception is not recommended if you have breast cancer, you should use two 
non-hormonal contraception methods. 
Talk to your healthcare provider about birth control methods that may be right for you. 
Men with female partners who are pregnant or able to become pregnant should use effective birth 
control (contraception), even after a vasectomy, during treatment with Talzenna and for at least 
4 months after the last dose.  
Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while taking Talzenna and for at least 1 month after the last dose. It is not 
known if Talzenna passes into breast milk. 
Fertility 
Talazoparib may reduce fertility in men. 
Driving and using machines 
Talzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy, weak, 
or tired (these are very common side effects of Talzenna), you should not drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to take Talzenna 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
How much to take 
Talzenna is taken by mouth once daily. The recommended dose is: 
- 
- 
for breast cancer: one 1 mg capsule of Talzenna. 
for prostate cancer: Talzenna is taken with a medicine called enzalutamide. The usual dose of 
Talzenna is 0.5 mg (two 0.25 mg capsules). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you get certain side effects while you are taking Talzenna alone or in combination with 
enzalutamide (see section 4), your doctor may lower your dose or stop treatment, either temporarily or 
permanently. Take Talzenna and enzalutamide exactly as your doctor has told you.  
Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the capsules. You can take 
Talzenna with food or between meals. Do not open the capsules. Contact with the capsule content 
should be avoided. 
If you take more Talzenna than you should 
If you have taken more Talzenna than your normal dose, contact your doctor or nearest hospital right 
away. Urgent treatment may be necessary. 
Take the carton and this leaflet so that the doctor knows what you have been taking. 
If you forget to take Talzenna 
If you miss a dose or vomit, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up 
for the forgotten or vomited capsules. 
If you stop taking Talzenna 
Do not stop taking Talzenna unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

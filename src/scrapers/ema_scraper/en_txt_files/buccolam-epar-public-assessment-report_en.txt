2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
A  seizure  is  defined  as  a  transient  occurrence  of  signs  and/or  symptoms  due  to  abnormal  excessive 
and  synchronous  neuronal  activity  in  the  brain.  Status  epilepticus  (SE)  is  defined  as  more  than  30 
minutes  of  either  continuous  seizure  activity  two  or  more  sequential  seizures  without  full  recovery  of 
consciousness between seizures. 
Convulsive  status  epilepticus  is  the  most  common  childhood  neurological  emergency  in  developed 
countries  and  can  lead  to  neurocognitive  sequelae  and  death.  The  incidence  of  status  epilepticus  is 
bimodally  distributed,  occurring  most  frequently  during  the  first  year  of  life  and  after  the  age  of  60 
years.  Amongst  children  (under  15  years  of  age),  infants  younger  than  12  months  have  the  highest 
incidence and frequency of the disease. 
An acute seizure occurs as the first stage of SE. The Applicant has proposed that Midazolam treats the 
acute seizure with the objective of preventing the development of SE. 
In clinical practice and most clinical guidelines, treatment is indicated in case of SE, acute seizures with 
loss of consciousness, seizures with (risk of) generalisation and prolonged seizures. Multiple drugs are 
available  for  treatment.  The  first  line  treatment  is  benzodiazepines  such  as  lorazepam  or  diazepam. 
Other drugs such as phenytoin (or fosphenytoin), phenobarbital and thiopentone are used in resistant 
Buccolam

cases.  In  the  hospital  setting  these  drugs  are  often  administered  intravenously.  Rectal administration 
(diazepam)  is  the  current  alternative  authorized  route.  Important  benefits  of  rectal  diazepam  are  a 
quick  onset  of  action  in  case  and  applicability  in  situations  where  intravenous  access  cannot  be 
obtained  i.e.  outside  the  emergency  room  setting.  Practical  disadvantages  of  rectal  diazepam  include 
the  need  to  remove  clothing  and  the  route  of  administration  itself  which  is  deemed  to  be  socially 
embarrassing  or  unacceptable  by  some  individuals  with  epilepsy,  their  parents  or  caregivers. 
Additionally, administration may be difficult during tonic-clonic seizures and for wheelchair users. 
Midazolam  is  a  derivative  of  the  imidazobenzodiazepine  group.  Its  mechanism  of  action  is  similar  to 
other  benzodiazepines.  Midazolam  has  an  anticonvulsant  effect,  a  hypno-sedative  effect,  and  an 
anxiolytic  and  muscle-relaxant  effect.  After  intramuscular  or  intravenous  administration  anterograde 
amnesia  of  short  duration  occurs.  Midazolams  effects  are  mediated  by  enhancement  of  gamma-
aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  neurotransmission  in  limbic,  thalamic  and  hypothalamic  regions  of  the 
central  nervous  system  (CNS).  The  anticonvulsant  activity  of  midazolam  is  mediated  by  inhibition  of 
the  spread  of  seizure  activity.  Effects  of  midazolam  resolve  rapidly  due  to  fast  metabolic 
transformation. 
Midazolam has been used as a systemically administered drug in the European Union (Hypnovel) and 
USA (Versed, now marketed generically) since December 1982 and December 1985, respectively when 
first  authorisations  were  granted  to  Roche.  There  is  currently  extensive  clinical  experience  with 
midazolam.  It  is  authorised  for  use  in  children  (including  neonates  <  32  weeks  gestational  age  in 
intensive  care  units)  and  adults  as  a  sedative  and  in  anaesthesia,  and  may  be  given  by  the 
intravenous, intramuscular or rectal route of administration. In addition, an oral formulation has been 
approved  in  the  USA  (October  1998  -  Versed  Oral  Syrup  2mg/ml,  now  marketed  generically)  and 
Germany (January 2007 - Midazolam-ratiopharm®) for preoperative sedation in children. 
This  is  an  application  submitted  via  the  Centralised  Procedure,  in  accordance  with  Regulation  No. 
EC/726/2004,  for  Buccolam  Oromucosal  Solution,  containing  5  mg/ml  of  the  active  substance, 
midazolam.  The  application  is  for  a  paediatric  use  marketing  authorisation  only  (PUMA)  under  Article 
30 of Regulation (EC) no. 1901/2006, and is submitted under article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended, as an hybrid application, with proposed changes to

with regard to the reference medicinal product, Hypnovel 10 mg/2 ml solution for injection, marketed 
by Roche Products Ltd. 
The  reference  medicinal  product  is  not  protected  by  a  supplementary  protection  certificate  under 
Regulation  (EEC)  no.  1768/92,  or  by  a  patent  which  qualifies  for  the  granting  of  the  supplementary 
protection certificate. 
Scientific advice was obtained from the EMA for the development programme on 25 September 2008, 
in  relation  to  the  robustness  of  the  clinical  data  publicly  available  and  the  pharmacokinetic  study 
performed by the Applicant (Ref:EMEA/H/SA/1132/1/2008/PED/SME/III). 
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) has been approved; decision no. EMEA-000395-PIP01-08, and the 
application has been subject to PIP compliance verification (PDCO compliance opinion no. P/155/2009). 
The indication applied for initially was the following:

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
The  finished  product  is  an  oromucosal  solution  that  is  a  clear,  colourless,  ready-to-use  solution 
containing midazolam hydrochloride as the active substance.  
The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  are:  sodium  chloride  (isotonic  agent),  sodium  hydroxide  (pH 
adjuster), hydrochloric acid (pH adjuster) and water for injection. 
The  excipients  and  packaging  materials  are  widely  used  in  pharmaceutical  preparations.  The  drug 
product  contains  no  preservatives,  thickening  agents,  colorants,  flavourings  or  buffering  agents  and 
the proposed excipients are considered acceptable for use in the paediatric population. 
The drug product is available in four different strengths and presentations indicated for different target 
age groups respectively: 2.5 mg (age group 3 months to 1 year), 5 mg (1 year to less than 5 years), 
7.5  mg  (5  years  to  less  than  10  years  old),  10  mg  (10  years  to  less  than  18  years).  The  different 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 9/47
 
 
 
 
strengths  are  differentiated  by  the  different  colours  for  the  labels  (yellow,  blue,  purple  and  orange). 
The  different  strengths  of  drug  product  have  the  same  quantitative  composition  but  different  filling 
volumes. 
The product is a single-use product and the doses are respectively 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg. 
The  full  amount  of  the  solution  should  be  inserted  slowly  into  the  space  between  the  gum  and  the 
cheek. It is expected that the volume to be inserted (ranging from 0.5 to 2 ml) is acceptable in view of 
the target age groups.  
The solution is filled into an amber polypropylene (PP) syringe (with a nominal capacity of 1 or 3 ml) 
with High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) cap and PP plunger rod with silicon seal.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  formulation  is  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  injectable  product  Hypnovel  10mg/2ml 
ampoules. This injectable formulation was used for buccal administration in the 4 pivotal comparator-
controlled clinical efficacy and safety studies conducted in children presented for this PUMA application. 
Aspects  of  formulation  development  considered  relevant  to  an  oromucosal  solution  have  been 
considered individually namely the taste, and the pH. 
The  taste  was  not  considered  a  critical  parameter  in  view  of  the  emergency  situation  in  which  the 
product will be administered. 
The  excipients  are  the  same  as  used  in  Hypnovel:  sodium  chloride,  hydrochloric  acid,  sodium 
hydroxide and water for injections. The choice of the excipients and their functions were explained. The 
target  pH  of  the  formulation  is  based  on  the  pH  of  the  reference  product.  An  acidic  pH  of  3.3  may 
enhance tooth decay. However, since the drug product is used only in emergency situations, the issue 
of tooth decay is not considered a major concern. In general an acidic solution is better tolerated than 
an alkaline solution. Given the fact that the formulation is not a buffered solution and is administered 
in a relatively small volume, it is expected that it will rapidly adapt to the physiological pH in the oral 
cavity.  No irritation/local intolerance was reported during the PK study by the Applicant. The pH of 3.3 
is considered acceptable 
Elaboration  on  the  pH-dependent  nature  of  midazolam  absorption  has  been  presented  (ionised 
molecule  minimally  absorbed).  Ring-closure  occurs  at  higher  pH,  increasing  lipophilicity  and 
transmucosal  permeation.  Since  the  proposed  formulation  has  minimal  buffering  capacity,  its  pH  is 
rapidly  increased  to  physiological  pH  of  7.4  on  administration,  such  that  virtually  all  of  the  active 
substance will exist in the closed ring structure. 
The proposed manufacturing process, using conventional equipment, was developed to incorporate the 
effective  dissolution  of  active  ingredient  into  an  aqueous  solution,  with  appropriate  sampling 
arrangements  to  provide  for  full  control  of  quality  attributes  of  the  bulk  and  filled  oral  syringes: 
including the key parameters of pH, bioburden and fill weights. 
The  drug  product  is  packed  in  amber  plastic  pre-filled  syringes.  Currently  available  stability  data 
confirm the compatibility between the drug product and packaging material. 
Although it is not a sterile medicinal product, the aseptic filtration ensures that the product is released 
with  low  bioburden.  No  preservative  was  added  to  the  formulation  however  contamination  during  in-
use  is  not  an  issue  since  it  is  a  single-use  product.  The  currently  available  release  and  stability  data 
demonstrate compliance with the Ph.Eur.5.1.4 requirements.

The  pharmaceutical  development  provided  was  considered  adequate  in  view  of  the  simplicity  of  the 
formulation and its similar composition to the already approved injectable product. 
Adventitious agents 
No  excipients  of  human  or  animal  origin  will  be  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  product  /  excipients. 
Therefore no TSE risk is anticipated. 
Manufacture of the product 
A description and flow chart of the manufacturing process including in-process controls are included in 
the  dossier.  The  manufacturing  consists  of  mixing  of  dispensed  midazolam  base  in  sodium  chloride 
solution with the appropriate targeted volume, and the addition of hydrochloric acid to form midazolam 
hydrochloride  and  reach  the  target  pH.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in  sufficient 
detail.  The  final  bulk  solution  is  filtered  through  an  aseptic  filter  into  pre-autoclaved  holding  bottles. 
Afterwards, the solution is filled into syringes. 
The control of critical steps and intermediates were presented. Controls applied during the critical step 
of  bulk  solution  preparation  have  been  adequately  defined.  The  bulk  solution,  prior  to  filtration  is 
considered  as  the  critical  intermediate,  and  is  tested  for  bioburden,  pH,  appearance,  identification, 
assay and related substances. Syringe filling is monitored by weight checking; target fill weights, and 
upper and lower acceptable limits have been defined for each presentation. 
The  manufacturing  process  was  validated  on  three  batches  of  drug  product  per  strength  (made  from 
three  production  batches  of  bulk  solution).  The  Applicant  provided  a  summary  of  the  process 
validation.  Based  on  the  available  information  it  shows  that  the  process  is  adequately  under  control 
and  is  suitable  for  consistent  manufacture  of  the  drug  product.  It  was  concluded  that  the 
manufacturing process was suitably controlled and of consistently producing of the required quality. 
All excipients used comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. No analytical validation is required and 
no  further justification  of the  specification. Sodium hydroxide  and  hydrochloric  acid  comply  with  their 
respective  Ph  Eur  monograph,  release  was  based  on  review  of  suppliers’  certificates  of  analysis 
together with a confirmatory identification test performed by the finished product manufacturer. 
Product specification 
The  release  and  end  of  shelf-life  drug  product  specifications  include  the  following  parameters  to  be 
controlled: description (visual), pH (Ph.Eur.), identification (IR Ph.Eur. and HPLC in-house), uniformity 
of  dosage  unit  (mass  variation,  Ph.  Eur.  2.9.40),  midazolam  content  (HPLC  in-house),  related 
substances (HPLC British Ph.), microbial contamination (Ph.Eur. 5.1.4). 
Analytical methods have been adequately described and the non-compendial methods validated in line 
with the corresponding ICH guidelines and the British Ph. Method was shown suitable for its use. 
The specification was considered appropriate however the Applicant will follow the recommendation to 
include minor updated tests with no impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. 
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  on  three  production  scale  batches  per  strength  (same  batches  as 
used  in  the  stability  studies),  showing  compliance  with  the  drug  product  specification.  The  limit  for 
individual  related  substances  is  consistent  with  the  ICH  identification  threshold  for  a  product  with  a 
maximum  daily  dose  of  10  mg  (as  per  CPMP/ICH/2738/99).  Microbiological  limits  are  consistent  with 
the acceptance criteria for aqueous preparations for oral use, as prescribed in Ph Eur 5.1.4.

No additional impurities were found in the drug product in comparison with the active substance.  
The  drug  product  is  packed  in  amber  pre-filled  syringes  to  protect  from  light.  The  individual  closed 
syringes  are  placed  into  outer  plastic  tubes  that  are  sealed  with  a  cap  before  insertion  into  suitable 
external cartons. Each carton contains 4 syringes. The primary container closure consists of an amber 
polypropylene (PP) syringe barrel with a nominal volume of 1 ml or 3 ml, an HDPE syringe tip cap, a 
coloured  PP  plunger  rod  and  an  opaque  silicon  plunger  rod  seal.  The  syringes  are  purchased  as  non-
sterile and are tested for bioburden control as part of the release testing / acceptance specification.  
Although  the  Applicant  did  not  declare  specific  compliance  with  EU  food  legislation  or  the  relevant 
Ph.Eur.  monographs,  compliance  with  Medical  Devices  Directive  93/42/EEC  as  amended  by  Medical 
Devices Directive 2007/47/EC is considered sufficient to confirm the suitability of the oral syringes for 
the drug product. 
An  investigation  into  the  impurity  profile  of  the  product  in  the  filled  container  (using  analysis  by  LC-
MS)  did  not  indicate  the  presence  of  container  related  extractables/leachables  including  elastomers, 
accelerants  and  plasticizers.  The  compatibility  between  the  drug  product  and  the  primary  packaging 
material was confirmed by the currently available stability data. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been initiated on 12 validation batches (3 x batches of each strength) filled from 
production  scale  batches  of  bulk  solution,  kept  in  the  commercial  packaging.  Samples  have  been 
studied  under  ICH  storage  conditions  (long-term:  12  months  at  25  oC/60%  RH;  intermediate:  12 
months  at  30  oC/65%  RH;  accelerated:  6  months  at  40  oC/75%  RH).  Samples  have  been  tested, 
according  to  methodology  described  for  the  finished  product,  for  appearance,  pH,  assay,  related 
substances, uniformity of dosage units and microbiological quality. 
The stability data show an increase of impurities but results for assay are slightly variable and show no 
clear  decreasing  trend.  The  other  parameters  remain  constant.  Overall,  all  the  parameters  remain 
within the specified limits under all storage conditions. 
Photostability data have been generated on Buccolam 2.5 mg and 10 mg samples stored in the amber 
plastic  syringes  stored  in  plastic  tubes  because  to  mimic  the  conditions  of  use.  The  samples  were 
exposed  to  the  full  100%  exposure  conditions  referenced  in  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B:  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were tested for appearance, pH, identification, 
assay and related substances. All results complied with the release and shelf life specifications. These 
data confirm that Buccolam is photostable. 
In addition, since no freeze-thaw studies have been performed. “Do not refrigerate or freeze” has been 
added to the Buccolam labelling. 
Based on the stability study results, the shelf-life mentioned in the SmPC can be granted.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information on development, manufacture and control of midazolam and the drug product have been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  the  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  turn  in  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have uniform and satisfactory performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be satisfactory when used in the conditions defined in the 
SPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
  Development and implementation of a satisfactory in-process test for seal integrity. 
  Revision  of  the  in-process  specification  limits  for  fill-weight,  based  on  the  results  from  available 
and ongoing batch validation data. 
  Development  and  implementation,  as  part  of  routine  release  testing,  of  the  identification  test  for 
the primary packaging materials of the oral syringe. 
  Review  the  suitability  of  the  proposed  in-process  specification  and  limits  as  an  integral  part  of  a 
commitment  to  formally  validate  the  first  three  commercial  production  batches  post  approval. 
Furthermore,  the  Applicant  commits  to  determine  if  a  +/-  5%  specification  can  be  achieved  by 
various technical changes and make this change and validate if technically possible by Q2/2012. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  line  with  the  CHMP  scientific  advice,  no  new  studies  have  been  conducted  in  support  of  this 
application. The non-clinical data are supported by references to relevant published scientific literature. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Midazolam is an imidazo benzodiazepine derivative. 
Benzodiazepines  modulate  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)-evoked  chloride  currents  through  a 
binding  site  on  the  GABA  A  receptor-operated  chloride  channel.  Midazolam  binds  to  benzodiazepine 
receptors  in  various  regions  of  the  brain  such  as  the  spinal  cord,  brain  stem,  cerebellum,  limbic 
system, and the cerebral cortex. 
It acts as a CNS depressant on CNS reflexes via the brain stem reticular formation. 
Buccolam

Animal  studies  show  that  midazolam  has  anxiolytic  and  sedative  properties  but  the  hypnotic  effects 
that it shows in humans are not evident in animals even at high doses.  Midazolam has a more rapid 
onset of action and shorter duration of effect than diazepam in most animal test systems. 
Midazolam  has  a  marked  anticonvulsant  effect  with  a  non-linear  relationship  between  concentration 
and effect without an apparent ceiling at higher concentrations. 
Antagonism of the anticonvulsant effect of midazolam by flumazenil suggested that there might be two 
separate sites of action, of which only one is antagonised by flumazenil. A study quoted concluded that 
the  effect  of  benzodiazepines  on  seizures  induced  by  cortical  stimulation  in  vivo  cannot  be  fully 
accounted for by an interaction at the GABA A receptor. At high concentrations, midazolam can inhibit 
calcium  entry  into  cells  by  a  non-GABA-dependent  mechanism  and  thereby  relaxes  bronchial  and 
vascular smooth muscle, but the relevance of this finding to the concentrations achieved in humans is 
doubtful. 
Midazolam has anticonvulsive activity in models employing young animals, however sedative effects of 
midazolam were lacking in neonatal animals. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Midazolam  at  therapeutic doses  had  almost  no  effect  on  the  cardiovascular  system  of  conscious  dogs 
after PO or IV administration. No direct effects of the drug on autonomic functions were found.  
Midazolam is a potent inhibitor of the nucleoside transporter (ventricle: pKi = 5.22±0.41, Ki = 6 μM). 
In  isolated  hearts,  midazolam  (5,  10  or  20  μM)  significantly  augmented  coronary  flow  in  a 
concentration-dependent  manner  in  the  presence  of  adenosine  (30  nM),  an  effect  reversed  by  ZM 
241385,  a  selective  A2A-receptor  antagonist.  In  contrast,  midazolam  did  not  increase  the  effect  of 
adenosine  (30  nM)  on  atrioventricular conduction. Similarly,  midazolam  potentiated  A2A-  but  not  A1-
receptor-mediated  effects  of  endogenous  adenosine  released  during  hypoxia,  thus  this  drug  did  not 
show any negative dromotropy. 
Midazolam  has  an  anti-inflammatory  action  by  inhibiting  inducible  nitric  oxide  synthase  and 
cyclo-oxygenase-2  expression,  possibly  through  suppression  of  NF-κB  and  p38  mitogen-activated 
protein kinase activation. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  data  indicate  that  midazolam  exerts  mild  haemodynamic  effects  in  conscious 
dogs at systemic exposure estimated to be several fold above human therapeutic exposures. 
In  view  of  the  lack  of  a  clinical  concern  regarding  the  safety  pharmacology  of  midazolam  and  the 
extensive clinical experience with midazolam, the paucity of non-clinical safety pharmacology data was 
not considered to be a concern by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Midazolam  has  been  found  to  have  synergistic  effects  with  dexmedetomidine  on  the  reactions  to 
various  stimuli  measuring  anaesthetic  action  and  ventilatory  side-effects  in  rats.  The  cardiovascular 
side-effects of dexmedetomidine were reduced in the presence of midazolam.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Following intravenous administration, the pharmacokinetics in rats was most adequately described by a 
bi-exponential  equation.  Following  oral  administration,  midazolam  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  an 
estimated  systemic  availability  of  45  ±  9%.  No  non-clinical  studies  evaluating  buccal  administration 
were performed. 
Distribution 
Midazolam is extensively bound to plasma proteins (94-98%). 
Metabolism 
Midazolam  is  extensively  metabolised  by  the  cytochrome  P450-dependent  mixed-function  oxidase 
system (CYP) in the liver. 
In  mouse  and  human  liver  microsomes,  the  enzymes  responsible  for  midazolam  hydroxylation  were 
CYP 3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP 3A1. 
The principal metabolite is 1-OH-midazolam, which is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid, although 
a  small  proportion is  further  hydroxylated  to  1,4-dihydroxymidazolam.  The  other  metabolite is  4-OH-
midazolam. 1-OH-midazolam is biologically active but has a shorter half-life than midazolam (< 1 h). It 
may  contribute  to  the  pharmacological  activity  of  the  drug  after  oral  administration.  However,  using 
classical pharmacological methods (rotarod test, chimney test, and anticonvulsant tests in mice) it was 
found that 1-OH-midazolam was clearly less potent than midazolam (1/10 to 1/40) when measured 30 
minutes after IP administration in mice. 4-OH-midazolam, which is formed only in very small amounts 
in  man,  had  on  the  whole  the  same  potency  as  1-OH-midazolam.  1,4-OH-midazolam  was  virtually 
inactive.  Therefore,  the  three  metabolites  account  only  to  a  negligible  extent,  (if  at  all)  for  the 
pharmacological effects of midazolam in the mouse 30 minutes after IP administration. 
Midazolam  hydroxylation,  a  reaction  considered  to  be  cytochrome  P-4503A  (CYP3A)-mediated  in 
humans,  was  examined  in  mouse  and  human  liver  microsomes.  Ketoconazole  potently  inhibited 
midazolam metabolite formation in human liver microsomes (IC50 range, 0.038–0.049 mM). 
Ketoconazole also inhibited the formation of 4-OH-midazolam in mouse liver microsomes (IC50 range, 
0.0076-0.025  μM;  see  also:  Pharmacokinetic  Drug  Interactions).  However,  ketoconazole  (10  μM)  did 
not  produce  50%  inhibition  of  α-OH-midazolam  formation  in  mouse  liver  microsomes.  The 
pharmacokinetic  interactions  studies  cited  by  the  Applicant  indicate  that  compounds  inhibiting  or 
inducing  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  involved  in  midazolam  metabolism  affect  midazolam  and 
metabolite  concentrations  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  Cytochrome  P450  3A  isoenzymes  appear  to  be 
major contributors in midazolam metabolism and are subject to potential pharmacokinetic interactions, 
but other isoenzymes may be involved as well. 
Excretion 
Less than 1% midazolam is excreted unchanged in the urine and the drug is cleared virtually entirely 
by liver metabolism. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Doses  up  to  1600  mg/kg  (oral  administration)  have  been  reported  as  LD50  in  the  mouse  by  the 
originator.  This  value  declined  to  about  1000  mg/kg  when  the  same  dose  was  administered  on  five 
Buccolam 
Assessment report

Page 15/47
 
 
 
successive days. Reported data in the literature quoted by the Applicant are 215 (oral rat) and 50 or 
higher for parenteral routes in rats or mice. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat  dose  toxicity  of  midazolam  was  studied  in  several  species.  Hepatotoxicity,  indicated  by 
increased  or  decreased  liver  weights,  centrilobular  hepatocytic  hypertrophy,  fatty  change,  hepatic 
masses  or  nodules,  mottled  liver  and  other  changes,  was  observed  in  mice  (at  8.5-80  mg/kg/d  PO), 
rats (1-80 mg/kg/d PO), rabbits (0.1-2.5 mg/kg/d IV) and dogs (7-45 mg/kg/d PO) given midazolam 
daily for 4 weeks to 24 months. Other adverse effects of repeated dosing in animals were increased or 
decreased  white  blood  cell  counts,  increased  or  decreased  body  weight  gain,  urinary  inflammation, 
increased  adrenal  cortical  weight  or  adrenal  cortical  hypertrophy,  increased  thyroid  and  kidney 
weights, decreased testes and pituitary gland weights, decreased serum glucose, increased serum urea 
nitrogen and albuminuria, increased or decreased alkaline phosphatase, decreased haemoglobin or red 
blood cells or haematocrit, proteinuria and increased gamma glutamyltranspeptidase activity. 
Genotoxicity 
Midazolam was negative in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. 
Carcinogenicity 
No  evidence  of  carcinogenic  potential  was  seen  in  rats  or  mice  receiving  oral  midazolam  maleate 
dosages  up  to  9  mg/kg  daily  (about  25  times  the  recommended  human  oral  dosage)  for  24  months. 
However,  an  increased  incidence  of  liver  tumours  was  observed  following  oral  administration  of  80 
mg/kg daily for 24 months in female mice, and an increased incidence of benign thyroid follicular cell 
tumours  was  observed  following  this  dosage  in  male  rats.  As  clinical  use  will  usually  be  short-term 
(single  use),  the  non-clinical  carcinogenicity  findings  are  of  no  concern  to  the  therapeutic  use  of 
midazolam.  Furthermore,  knowing  midazolam  is  an  enzyme-inducer,  the  occurrence  of  liver  and 
follicular  thyroid  tumours  in  mice  is  not  unexpected  and  might  be  related  to  a  rodent-specific 
mechanism of carcinogenesis. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No  evidence  of  impaired  fertility  was  observed  in  rats  following  administration  of  midazolam  maleate 
dosages up to 10 times the recommended adult human IV dosage of 350 μg/kg. 
Based  on  experimental  animal  studies,  midazolam  use  during  pregnancy  is  not  expected  to  increase 
the  risk  of  congenital  anomalies.  Use  near  delivery  may  result  in  neonatal  respiratory  depression. 
Considering  the  lack  of  controlled  studies  on  the  use  of  midazolam  in  early  pregnancy,  a  cautionary 
approach is still to be recommended. 
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetics data have been presented, which is considered acceptable. 
Local Tolerance  
No non-clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the local tolerance of the oromucosal route of 
delivery  of  the  drug  substance  or  the  proposed  formulation.  This  is  in  accordance  with  EMA  scientific 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 16/47
 
 
 
advice and the adopted PIP on the basis that clinical data are available to support the local tolerance of 
the oral mucosa following oromucosal administration of midazolam in children. 
Other toxicity studies 
Studies in juvenile rats suggest that short-term oral administration (up to two weeks) up to 10 mg/kg 
is well-tolerated. No toxicokinetic data are available from these studies. 
There  are  indications  that  the  main  target  organ  in  juvenile  rats  was  the  liver,  although  only  slight 
effects  were  recorded,  presumably  because  of  the  relatively  low  doses  used.  This  provides  some 
reassurance  that  juvenile  animals  are  not  more  susceptible  to  the  known  toxicity  of  midazolam  and 
that there was no new toxicity in juvenile animals. 
Literature  data  suggest  anti-inflammatory  properties  of  midazolam.  This  may  be  considered  a  signal 
that midazolam has immunomodulatory effects. Nevertheless, in the absence of a clinical concern and 
in view of the usually short-term administration in humans, there is currently no need for further data 
on the immunotoxic potential of midazolam. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant submitted a Phase I Environmental Risk Assessment. 
The log of the partition coefficient (Log KOW) of Midazolam was determined to be 3.30, 3.39 and 3.34 
at pH 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Based on a refined Fpen, the estimated PECsurfacewater is far below the 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L. 
Midazolam PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log KOW does not exceed 4.5. Therefore no Phase II ERA is required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  pharmacology,  toxicity,  kinetics  and  clinical  adverse  effects  of  midazolam  following  systemic 
administration  are  well  known  and  documented  in  numerous  scientific  publications.  The  standard 
toxicological  and  pharmacological  particulars  are  well  documented.  The  Applicant  provided  a 
Buccolam

satisfactory analysis of the nonclinical data of midazolam HCl to support this application. Reference has 
been  made  to  relevant  published  scientific 
literature,  with  special  emphasis  on  detailed 
pharmacological  monographs,  to  provide  an  integrated  and  critical  assessment  of  the  pharmacologic, 
pharmacokinetic, and toxicological evaluation of the active ingredient, with particular emphasis on its 
proposed oromucosal use in the paediatric population (children aged from 3 months to <18 years). 
The available data do not suggest that there are any differences in pharmacokinetics between juvenile 
and adult animals that would be relevant to clinical use. 
Studies in juvenile rats suggest that short-term oral administration (up to two weeks) up to 10 mg/kg 
is well-tolerated and provide reassurance that infants are not expected to be more susceptible to the 
known toxicity of midazolam. No toxicokinetic data are available from these studies. 
Based  on  experimental  animal  studies,  midazolam  use  during  pregnancy  is  not  expected  to  increase 
the  risk  of  congenital  anomalies.  Use  near  delivery  may  result  in  neonatal  respiratory  depression. 
Considering  the  lack  of  controlled  studies  on  the  use  of  midazolam  in  early  pregnancy,  a  cautionary 
approach  is  still  to  be  recommended.  The  product  information  reflects  that  the  risk  for  new-born 
infants should be taken into account in the event of administration of midazolam in the third trimester 
of pregnancy. 
No non-clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the local tolerance of the oromucosal route of 
delivery  of  the  drug  substance  or  the  proposed  formulation.  This  is  in  accordance  with  EMA  scientific 
advice  and  the  adopted  PIP  on  the  basis  that  clinical  data  are  available  to  address  this  aspect  of  the 
product. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
General  aspects  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  of  midazolam  are  addressed 
by the Applicant on the basis of literature data. The extensive literature review of the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology of midazolam is considered appropriate and acceptable to support the 
non-clinical aspect of Buccolam. 
Several  aspects  specifically  relevant  for  this  application,  including  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  in 
young  children  are  only  to  a  limited  extent  addressed  in  the  non-clinical  part.  These  aspects  are, 
however, further discussed in the clinical part. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Published data from clinical efficacy and safety studies with midazolam hydrochloride administered by 
the  proposed  route  of  administration  (oromucosal)  for  the  treatment  of  acute  seizures  in  the  target 
population (children) are available. 
In  addition,  the  standard  clinical  pharmacological  particulars  are  well  documented.  However,  the 
available published pharmacokinetic data of midazolam administered by the oromucosal route are not 
adequate.    Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  scientific  advice  and  the  adopted  PIP,  a  PK  study 
was  conducted  in  children  to  characterise  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  proposed  formulation 
administered oromucosally. 
To support the application the clinical pharmacology package included: 
 
a PK study sponsored by Applicant on the proposed buccal formulation in children [MID001] 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 18/47
 
 
 
 
in silico simulation data generated from PBPK modelling 
  3 published studies on standard pharmacology and comparative bioavailability of buccal midazolam 
To support the application the clinical efficacy/safety package included: 
 
published efficacy/safety data from studies in children with prolonged seizures treated with buccal 
midazolam+ midazolam by other administration routes 
 
supportive efficacy/safety data from published studies in adults treated with buccal midazolam for 
the same indication  
 
supportive safety data from extensive clinical experience from systemic/oral exposure of children 
and adults to midazolam for currently approved indications in EU and USA for Hypnovel and 
Versed, respectively 
GCP 
The sponsored clinical trial MID001 was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
Regarding  the  non-Applicant-sponsored  bibliographic  data,  the  Applicant  could  not  confirm  that  the 
studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  this  was  not  mentioned  in  the  publications. 
However, those studies were conducted in countries where GCP and ethical principles are applied and 
the Applicant assumes that these studies complied with that. There are no indications of violations of 
GCP principles in the submitted study reports. 
The publications on all of the controlled studies, and the majority of the uncontrolled studies, mention 
ethics approval and/or parental informed consent. All studies were conducted within the last 15 years 
and therefore are likely to have been conducted in accordance with current research practices. 
With  respect  to  the  pivotal  studies  all  of  the  publications,  except  one  (Baysun  S  et  al.,  2005),  state 
that ethics approval and parental consent was obtained. 
For  the  above-mentioned  reasons  the  CHMP  considered  the  lack  of  confirmation  of  the  GCP  status 
acceptable. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This is a hybrid application for a new pharmaceutical form (but not a new formulation), new route of 
administration  (oromucosal  route)  and  new  indication.  The  (BUCCOLAM)  formulation  is  essentially 
similar to the authorised originator product midazolam hydrochloride injection (Hypnovel® 10mg/2ml), 
which has been authorised in the EU for more than 25 years. 
Midazolam  is  a  water  soluble  imidazo  benzodiazepine  derivative.  It  is  metabolised  into  an  active 
metabolite  1-hydroxymidazolam  and  2  minor  inactive  metabolites:  4-hydroxy  metabolite  and  1,4  -
hydroxy metabolite. Only midazolam and 1-OH midazolam have been considered in this application.

4.  Published  study  in  paediatric  patients  (acute  seizures  and  malaria)  using  Hypnovel  10mg/2ml 
formulation [Muchohi SN et al 2008] 
5.  Published study in healthy adults using Hypnovel 10mg/2ml formulation [Schwagmeier R et al., 
1998] 
The Applicant stated that a bridging PK study to demonstrate relative bioavailability or bioequivalence 
to  the  formulation  used  in  the  pivotal  studies  (i.e.  a  pharmacokinetic  comparison  to  the  Hypnovel 
formulation delivered oromucosally) was not required since the proposed buccal formulation is identical 
to  the  Hypnovel  10mg/2ml  formulation.  This  was  agreed  as  BUCCOLAM  has  been  proven  to  be 
essentially similar to Hypnovel 10mg/2ml. 
Only the first 2 studies were performed by the Applicant to support this application. Study MID001 is 
an open-label, sparse sampling of single-dose study of 0.2 mg/kg buccal midazolam in patients from 3 
months  to  <18  years  in  children  undergoing  routine  elective  surgery  who  are  otherwise  healthy  and 
was designed to collect the PK data necessary for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The study 
design was in accordance to the comments made by EMA during scientific advice and in accordance to 
the  PIP  application  review  process.  Study  Simcyp  is  a  silico  modelling  (computer  simulation) 
investigation  which  predicted  the  age  -  dose  linearity  of  buccal  midazolam  using  published  data  on 
midazolam.

No  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  in  the  target  population.  In  accordance  with  scientific 
advice,  study  MID001  was  conducted  in  the  surgical  setting  in  which  the  buccal  midazolam  was 
administered as a premedication agent in children undergoing routine elective surgery (and otherwise 
healthy). This setting provided a robust dataset from a homogeneous population. 
Since  the  formulation  of  Buccolam  is  the  same  as  that  of  Hypnovel  10mg/2ml,  the  pharmacokinetic 
data  from  the  other  3  studies  in  children  and  adults  which  used  the  Hypnovel  10mg/2ml  formulation 
are  directly  supportive  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  expected  for  Midazolam  Hydrochloride 
Oromucosal Solution (BUCCOLAM). 
1. Study MID001 
The study was conducted in 50 paediatric patients (3 months - <18 years; 37 males and 13 females) 
who were undergoing routine surgery and required premedication with midazolam. Blood samples were 
taken  from  time  zero  up  to  8  hours  post  dose  or  just  prior  to  the  removal  of  the  cannula  (whichever 
was  the  latest).  A  maximum  of  4  blood  samples  were  taken  in  children  under  2  years  old  and  6 
samples in children over 2 years old. 
Patients  were  administered  a  single  dose  of  0.2mg/kg  bw  of  BUCCOLAM  (up  to  a  maximum  10mg 
[2ml]) by the buccal route (inserted into the space between the gum and the cheek). 
Sampling and analytical methods 
A  total  of  263  blood  samples  from  50  patients  collected  from  9  minutes  to  5  hours  33  minutes  were 
evaluated  for  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  the  parent  drug  and  its  metabolite  1-hydroxy  (1-OH) 
midazolam  metabolite.  Protein  precipitation  and 
liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass

spectrometric detection was used for the determination of the plasma concentrations of midazolam and 
1-hydroxy midazolam. 
The duration of the samplings appeared to be sufficient as the elimination half-life was captured. Based 
on  the  validation  report,  the  analytical  method  is  sufficiently  validated  and  the  criteria  used  for 
acceptance  are  in  accordance  to  the  guidelines.  The  handling,  processing  and  analysis  of  the  plasma 
samples were performed according to established standard procedures and that the analytical analysis 
took place within the tested 3-month stability period. Sufficient supporting evidence has been provided 
attesting to the reliability of the bioanalytical analysis.

2. In Silico Simulation 
As a part of the paediatric investigation plan approved by the PDCO, the Applicant justified the use of a 
dose of 0.2 mg/kg in their new pharmacokinetic study in children as being representative of the higher 
doses used in this indication (0.25 – 0.5 mg/kg) based on the expectation of pharmacokinetic linearity.  
This expectation was derived from an in silico modelling and simulation approach (Simcyp paediatric), 
using  prior  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  information  on  the  metabolism  and  kinetics  (PK)  of  midazolam,  to 
predict  exposure  and  PK  linearity  of  buccal  midazolam  in  children  of  different  ages.  Predictions  of 
plasma  drug  concentration-time  profiles  were  performed  using  a  population  of  virtual  paediatric 
individuals.  Each  population  was  generated  using  values  and  formulae  describing  demographic, 
anatomical and physiological variables.  
Simulations  to  reflect  buccal  administration  of  midazolam  at  doses  of  0.05,  0.1,  0.2,  0.25,  0.5  and 
1mg/kg to children aged 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 18 years were conducted. 
Two  model  types  were  explored,  one  compartment  model  and  a  full  PBPK  (physiologically  based 
pharmacokinetic) model that aims to represent drug distribution more realistically. 
The predictions from the two models are shown in the figures below: 
Figure PK- 1. Simulated AUC (left panel) and Cmax (right panel) of midazolam as a function of dose and 
age  after  administration  of  a  single  dose  by  zero  order  infusion  over  20  min  (to  replicate  buccal 
administration)  (dose  range  0.05  to  1  mg/kg)  and  based  on  the  one  compartment  model  (median 
values from 10 trials of 10 subjects each). 
Figure PK- 2. Simulated AUC (left panel) and Cmax (right panel) of midazolam as a function of dose and 
age  after  administration  of  a  single  dose  by  zero  order  infusion  over  20  min  (to  replicate  buccal 
administration)  (dose  range  0.05  to  1  mg/kg)  and  based  on  the  PBPK  model  (median  values  from  10 
trials of 10 subjects each).   
The approach taken by the Applicant to justify a priori the appropriateness of the dose selected for the 
population  PK  study  of  midazolam  in  children,  based  on  current  knowledge  of  the  ontogeny  of  the 
enzymes  responsible  for  midazolam  metabolism  and  the  physiological  development  of  children  was 
initially approved as part of the PIP.

The  ‘Simcyp  Paediatric  Simulator’  has  been  evaluated  against  in  vivo  studies  in  predicting  of  the 
clearance of a number of drugs in neonates, infants and children. 
Both  models  used  in  the  simulation  predicted  the  same  behaviour:  proportionality  between  AUC  (as 
well as Cmax) and Dose. This approach is considered valid and it is agreed that, given the assumptions 
and limitations of the IVIVE process, no evidence of PK non linearity is expected over the dose range 
simulated (0.05 - 1mg/kg) in any of the age bands from 1 day to 18 years of age.  Thus, it is agreed 
that  based  on  these  simulations,  it  is  appropriate  to  extrapolate  from  the  dose  of  0.2  mg/kg  used  in 
MID001 to the proposed posology (~0.25 – ~0.5 mg/kg) for seizure control in paediatric patients. 
The data used in the simulations, however, do not entirely reflect the conditions in this application (i.e. 
buccal formulation data are from adults and data from the paediatric population are from iv injections 
while  this  application  concerns  buccal  formulation  in  paediatric  population.  Drug  and  metabolite 
concentration-time  data  collected  in  study  MID001  was  not  used  to  inform  the  paediatric  simulation 
model,  to  add  value  to  the  understanding  of  midazolam  and  metabolite  pharmacokinetics  in  the 
paediatric population and aid to appropriate dosing in all paediatric patients categories.  The Applicant 
claimed that this exercise may not necessarily give additional understanding of buccal midazolam and 
1-OHMDZ  pharmacokinetics  and  consequently  no  further  confirmation  of  the  paediatric  dose  or 
changes to the SPC would be obtained. 
The CHMP concluded that the current paediatric simulation model could not be accepted as a reliable 
basis for bridging the pharmacokinetics and efficacy data for midazolam (or its active metabolite, 1-OH 
midazolam). However, the results on age-dose linearity are to be considered. 
3. Study in healthy adults using 10 mg midazolam in 2ml peppermint flavoured fluid 
formulation [Scott RC et al., 1998] 
The CHMP noted that the dose used in this study is slightly lower than the dose (0.15mg/kg) used in 
Study  MID001.  Nevertheless,  this  study  in  adults  also  demonstrated  a  similar  rapid  and  very  high 
bioavailability. 
4. Study in paediatric patients using Hypnovel formulation [Muchohi SN et al 2008] 
The rapid (15 minutes) and very high bioavailability (87%) of the buccally administered midazolam in 
this study is in line with the PK estimates obtained from the population modelling study MID001. 
There was approximately a two-fold variation in plasma midazolam clearance. This high variability is 
in accordance with the literature. 
The dose used in the above study is slightly higher than in Study MID001 (0.3 mg/kg vs 0.2 mg/kg). 
Four  out  of  the  31  children  experienced  respiratory  depression  in  the  former  study  while  no 
respiratory  depression  was  reported  in  the  latter  study.  The  higher  dose  could  explain  the  high 
respiratory depression observed in the study. 
5. Study in healthy adults using Hypnovel formulation [Schwagmeier R et al., 1998] 
The  dose  used  in  the  study  is  3-fold  lower  than  the  dose  used  in  Study  MID001.  Nevertheless,  this 
study in adults demonstrated again a rapid (Tmax =30 minutes) and very high (75.5%) bioavailability 
of  the  buccally  administered  midazolam  and  support  the  estimates  obtained  from  the  population 
modelling study MID001.

Absorption 
Study  MID001  showed  that  absorption  of  buccally  administered  midazolam  is  high  (C  =  73.2  ng/ml, 
AUC = 130.5 ng/ml/hour) with a Tmax of 24 minutes. When midazolam is given by the buccal route it 
passes  directly  to  the  superior  vena  cava,  avoiding  first-pass  hepatic  metabolism.  Bioavailability  is 
therefore  much  higher  than  when  given  orally  which  involves  intestinal  absorption  and  first-pass 
metabolism  in  the  liver  and  intestine  before  it  enters  the  systemic  circulation.  The  absolute 
bioavailability  of  oromucosal  midazolam  is  about  75%  in  adults.      This  is  in  contrast  to  the  30-50% 
expected after oral dosing. 
Analysis  of  Cmax  across  the  age  categories  showed  no  significant  differences.  There  appears  to  be  a 
positive correlation of AUC with age (r2 = 0.55) and bodyweight (r2 = 0.48). Analysis of AUC showed 
significantly differences across the age categories (p=0.0003). 
No  studies  were  done  on  the  effect  of  food.  Based  on  the  literature,  food  has  no  effect  on  the 
absorption and disposition of midazolam in adults. Therefore, food is not expected to have a significant 
effect on PK parameters in the emergency setting where BUCCOLAM is to be used. 
Distribution 
Study  MID001  showed  that  Midazolam  by  buccal  administration  appears  to  have  a  very  extensive 
distribution (steady state volume distribution of 5.3 L/kg) reflecting its high lipid solubility.  
No  studies  on  protein  binding  were  performed.  However,  data  in  the  literature  showed  high  and 
concentration  independent  plasma  protein  binding  of  midazolam.  In  adults  and  paediatric  patients 
older  than  1  year,  approximately  96-98%  of  midazolam  is  bound  to  plasma  proteins,  principally 
albumin. This information is stated in section 5.2 of the SPC. 
Elimination 
In  study  MID001,  the  mean  clearance  for  midazolam  was  30ml/kg/min  and  the  initial  and  terminal 
elimination half-lives (mean ± SD) were 26.7 ± 13.8 and 203.7 ± 86.8 minutes, respectively. 
Weight  and  age  appeared  to  exert  effects.  Midazolam  clearance  increases  non-linearly  while  volume 
distribution  increases  proportionally.  1-OH  midazolam  clearance  and  volume  distribution  are  affected 
non-linearly with age. 
The  CHMP  expressed  its  concern  in  relation  to  the  lower  age  limit  as  infants  below  6  months  are 
expected to have a greater exposure in comparison with older children on a fixed dosing based on age 
due to slower metabolism (CYP3A activity is only 50 % of older children and adults), longer elimination 
half-life and decreased clearance and the risk to respiratory insufficiency and hypoventilation. 
The Applicant claimed that based on the simulated data from the MID001 study the exposures in the 3 
-  6  month  age  group  (149  ng.min/ml  and  94ng/ml,  AUC  and  Cmax,  respectively)  are  comparable  to 
the children younger than 1 year (146 ng/min/ml and 94 ng/ml, AUC and Cmax, respectively) and the 
age  group  1-5  years  (212  ng.min/ml  and  139ng/ml,  AUC  and  Cmax,  respectively)  with  overlapping 
values. As to the higher AUC ratio between 1-hydroxy midazolam and midazolam, in the age group 3 
months – 2 <years, it has been argued  that this may be due to younger children swallowing a higher 
proportion of the dose as they were conscious. 
Concerning  safety,  it  was  argued  that  there  is  significant  experience  in  the  use  midazolam  (and  its 
metabolite) in neonates and young infants by oral and iv administration and the available data indicate 
Buccolam

that  the  absolute  risk  for  respiratory  depression  is  extremely  small  including  those  from  3  months, 
whether given in a hospital or community setting. 
The simulations provided to support the posology in children between the ages of 3 and 6 months are 
based  on  the  population  PK  analysis  of  data  from  MID001.  The  study  population  included  only  three 
children between the ages of 3 and  6 months, one of whom had the highest concentrations of active 
metabolite  observed  in  the  study.  Also,  there  was  a  trend  for  a  higher  metabolite  to  drug  ratio  in 
younger children. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  are  insufficient  data  to  support  the  safe  use  in  the  community  in 
children less than 6 months. Therefore, it is advised to limit the use of buccolam in the 3-6 month age 
group to the hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available, as 
it  can  not  be  excluded  that  these  infants  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  respiratory  insufficiency  and 
hypoventilation  as  compared  to  children  elder  than  6  months  of  age.  The  Applicant  agreed  to  add 
children  of  less  than  6  months  of  age  to  the  list  of  important  missing  information  and  closely 
monitoring in the RMP, signal detection and discussion in PSURs. 
The CHMP also expressed some uncertainties on the posology for adolescents >12 years of age (>40 
kg),  including  children  with  excessive  body-weight,  which  could  need  adjustment  to  ensure  an 
efficacious dose. 
The data submitted by the Applicant based on the simulations of study MID001, confirm that systemic 
exposures can be expected to be in similar range between age- and weight groups using the proposed 
posology. It should be noted though, that the dosage by bodyweight varies considerably and in some 
cases  lies  well  outside  the  range  reported  in  the  literature  (0.25  –  0.5  mg/kg).  The  reason  for  this 
appears to be associated with the variability of exposure between individuals of similar age and weight 
treated  with  identical  doses.  The  graphs  submitted  by  Applicant  suggest  10-fold  differences  in  Cmax 
and  AUC.  It  is  considered  unlikely  that  this  magnitude  of  variance  would  be  explained  solely  by 
variable  swallowing,  especially  at  the  older  age  groups.  Other  factors  contributing  to  this  variance 
remain unclear. 
Nonetheless,  the  median  level  of  exposure  by  age  or  weight  appears  comparable  for  all  age-  and 
weight  groups  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  in  the  pivotal  studies.  This 
supports the proposed posology. The risk of under dosing of adolescents has in any case been should 
be added to the RMP as a potential and will be addressed in PSURs as a special item in case a higher 
formulation strength needs to be provided. 
Metabolism and excretion 
Midazolam  is  metabolised  into  an  active  metabolite  1-hydroxymidazolam  and  2  minor  inactive 
metabolites: 4-hydroxy metabolite and 1,4 -hydroxy metabolite. 
Based on the AUC ratio of 1-hydroxy midazolam and midazolam 46% of midazolam is converted into 
1-OH midazolam with an estimated half-life of 0.84 hour. In the literature it is reported that 50 -70 % 
of  midazolam  is  converted  into  this  metabolite  with  a  half-life  of  1-3  hours.  The  discordance  of  the 
estimated values with reported data is not surprising as it is known that the PK of midazolam and its 
active metabolite show high variability. 
No  excretion  study  was  performed.  According  to  the  literature,  however,  the  urinary  metabolites  are 
excreted mainly as conjugates, with only a small proportion (less than 0.03%) excreted unchanged in 
the urine.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of the drug is similar in adults regardless of it being given as a single IV dose or 
as  an  infusion.  Following  oral  administration  of  10,  20  and  40mg  in  adult  volunteers,  peak  plasma 
levels occur within 30 minutes with a linear relationship between plasma levels and dosage. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  orally  administered  midazolam  has  also  demonstrated  linearity  in  the 
paediatric population in a study conducted by the originator in support of the Versed Oral Syrup NDA. 
Midazolam  exhibited  dose  proportionality in  the  oral  dose  range  0.25  to  1.0mg/kg  (to  a  maximum  of 
40mg)  across  the  age  range  of  6  months  to  16  years.  Midazolam  also  exhibits  dose-proportionality 
between doses of 0.25 to 1.0mg/kg within the age group of 2 years to <16years. However, the small 
sample size did not permit meaningful assessment  of dose-proportionality within the age  groups of  6 
months to < 2 years and 12 years to <16 years. 
The  in  silico  modelling  study  of  buccal  midazolam  in  children  (Study  Simcyp)  also  predicted  dose 
linearity by the buccal route. No evidence of PK non-linearity was detected over the buccal midazolam 
dose range studied (0.05 – 1mg/kg) in any of the age bands from 1 day to 18 years of age. Thus the 
study predicted dose linearity of buccal midazolam PK in the range 0.05-1mg/kg across the paediatric 
age  range  0  –  18  years.  Therefore,  this  justified  linear  extrapolation  of  the  PK  data  generated  in  the 
buccal midazolam PK study using a dose of 0.2mg/kg to the doses proposed for licensing (fixed doses 
banded by age [range ~0.25 – ~0.5mg/kg]). 
Special populations 
Overall, no studies were performed on pharmacokinetics in special populations. This was agreed by 
CHMP since the medicinal product is essentially similar to the originator product Hypnovel. 
 
Impaired renal function 
In  renal  failure,  1-hydroxymidazolam,  the  active  metabolite  of  midazolam  can  be  expected  to 
accumulate prolonging the pharmacological effects. 
No studies of midazolam in children with chronic renal failure (CRF) are provided or known. From the 
limited  studies  in  adults,  it  is  advised  to  titrate  to  the  desired  effect  of  midazolam  in  patients  with 
chronic  renal  disease.  Section  4.4  of  the  proposed  BUCCOLAM  SmPC  advises  caution  in  this  group  of 
patients. 
However, in the setting of treatment of an acute epileptic seizure, a single dose of buccal midazolam is 
unlikely to accumulate to the extent that the prolongation of pharmacological action is of great clinical 
significance. 
 
Impaired hepatic function 
No studies of midazolam in children with chronic liver disease are provided or known. Studies in adults 
showed  that  chronic  hepatic  disease  alters  the  pharmacokinetics  of  midazolam.  Section  4.4  of  the 
proposed BUCCOLAM SmPC advises caution in this group of patients. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  it  is  unlikely  that  any  prolongation  of  pharmacological  action  is  of  great 
clinical significance in this indication. 
 
Gender 
Based on the PK population analysis (MID001) gender was not a significant factor. 
The CHMP agreed with this conclusion, which is in line with existing data on midazolam. 
 
Race 
Ethnic differences in CYP3A polymorphisms are known to exist, though there is insufficient evidence to 
date  to  suggest  that  the  major  polymorphic  variants  in  CYP3A4  have  any  association  with  CYP3A4 
activity. Therefore, no difference in dosing based on race is recommended.

Plots  of  midazolam  and  1-hydroxy  midazolam  AUC  and  Cmax  using  the  empirical  Bayes  parameter 
estimates  from  the  final  covariate  models  for  the  study  population  of  Study  MID001  at  the  proposed 
posology doses were presented. These plots (midazolam and its metabolite) indicate no correlation of 
either parameter, AUC/AUCm or Cmax/Cmaxm, with age or weight i.e. exposures across the age and 
weight range for the study MID001 population are similar at the proposed posology doses.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new specific studies with the current formulation were performed. 
Drug-(non)drug  interaction  studies  reported  in  the  literature  have  been  conducted  in  healthy  adult 
volunteers. These are summarised in the Hypnovel EU SmPC. The drug-drug interactions based on the 
Hypnovel EU SmPC are accepted as the medicinal product is essentially similar to Hypnovel. 
Agents  inhibiting  the  main  metabolising  cytochrome  p-450  3A4  sub  enzyme  may  increase  midazolam 
plasma concentrations. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic studies were performed. One published pharmacodynamic study in adults [Scott 
RC et al., 1998] was submitted. In this study, the buccal route administration of 10 mg midazolam has 
been shown to produce a rapid (≤5 – 10 minutes) neurophysiological effect in healthy adults (EEG). 
The  pharmacodynamics  of  midazolam  delivered  by  the  authorised  routes  of  administration  is  well-
known.  Midazolam  pharmacologic  effects  include  anticonvulsant,  anxiolysis,  sedation,  hypnosis,  and 
skeletal relaxation. Anterograde amnesia of short duration can occur following its administration.  
The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; 
midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances 
the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (increased frequency of Cl− channel 
opening) resulting in neural inhibition. 
The  anticonvulsant  activity  of  midazolam  is  mediated  by  inhibition  of  the  spread  of  seizure  activity. 
Midazolam  anxiolytic,  sedative  and  hypnotic  effects  are  mediated  by  enhancement  of  gamma-
aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  neurotransmission  at  the  limbic,  thalamic  and  hypothalamic  levels  of  the 
central nervous system (CNS). Skeletal relaxation is produced by inhibition of spinal polysynaptic and 
monosynaptic afferent pathways, blockade of excitatory synaptic transmission and depression of motor 
nerve and muscle function. 
Published  reports  show  that  1-hydroxymidazolam  (major  metabolite)  is  equipotent  to  midazolam  and 
contributes significantly to the efficacy of midazolam after an oral dose compared to an IV dose (AUC0-
∞ ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam to midazolam after an oral dose is about two fold higher than after an 
IV dose). Data obtained using saccadic eye movements and EEG changes as surrogate effects following 
separate administration of intravenous midazolam 0.1mg/kg and 1-OH-midazolam 0.15mg/kg suggest 
that 1-OH-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound. 
The metabolism and clearance of midazolam may be affected by a wide range of drugs that inhibit or 
induce cytochrome P450 3A as this will interfere with the metabolic removal of midazolam. The same 
drug interactions apply as for the other licensed routes of administration and these have been included 
in the proposed SmPC.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the PK estimates of buccal midazolam, using population modelling, is in accordance to the 
published  data  for  buccal,  oral,  im  and  iv  midazolam.  The  provided  information  on  pharmacokinetic 
analysis  show  that  the  handling,  processing  and  analysis  of  the  plasma  samples  were  performed 
according  to  established  standard  procedures  and  that  the  analytical  analysis  took  place  within  the 
tested  3-month  stability  period.  Hence,  sufficient  supporting  evidence  has  been  provided  attesting  to 
the reliability of the analysis. 
There are almost no actual data to support the safe use of midazolam in the proposed dose in children 
less than 6 months of age. The paediatric simulation model cannot be accepted as a reliable basis for 
bridging  the  pharmacokinetics  and  efficacy  data  for  midazolam  and  its  active  metabolite,  1-OH 
midazolam.    Given  the  trend  for  a  higher  metabolite  to  drug  ratio  in  younger  children,  a  delayed 
respiratory  depression  as  a  result  of  high  metabolite  concentrations  in  the  3-6  months  age  group 
cannot be excluded. 
Therefore,  considering  the  seriousness of  the  condition, it is  advised  to  limit  the  use  of  midazolam in 
the  3-6  month  age  group  to  the  emergency  room  setting  as  where  respiratory  function  can  be 
monitored and equipment for respiratory assistance, if needed, is available. 
In  the  data  provided  by  the  Applicant,  the  median  level  of  exposure  by  age  or  weight  appears 
comparable for all age- and weight groups, which is in accordance with the efficacy and safety results 
in the pivotal studies. This supports the proposed posology. Nevertheless, the risk of under dosing of 
adolescents  should  be  added  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  need  to  be  addressed  in  PSURs  as  a 
special item. 
In the study by Scott et al (1998) EEG monitoring was performed on 10 healthy adults who received 
10 mg buccal midazolam to be held in their mouth for 5 minutes. The pharmacodynamic phase of that 
study  was  double  blind  and  used  EEG  to  monitor  PD  effects.  Most  subjects  reached  blood  levels  of  
5  µg/l  within  10  minutes.  A  mean  maximum  concentration  of  32.73  µg/l  +/-  6.4  µg/l  (2SD)  was 
achieved  in  48  minutes  +/-  28  minutes  (2SD).  The  EEG  data  showed  changes  in  the  8-  to  30-Hz 
frequencies in ≤5-10 minutes in test but not in control subjects; the interaction between drug and time 
on the relative power of these frequency bands was statistically significant. The effect on the EEG was 
more  rapid  than  expected  from  the  venous  absorption  data  indicating  the  speed  of  cerebral  effect  of 
the drug delivered buccally. 
The  same  drug  interactions  apply  as  for  the  other  licensed  routes  of  administration  and  these  have 
been included in the proposed SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No full reports on dose-effect studies or PK/PD studies in the target age group have been submitted. 
However,  observed  EEG  effects  are  in  accordance  with  the  buccal  PK  profile  and  clinical  effects  of 
buccal midazolam. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
No dose finding studies were submitted by the Applicant. 
The  clinical  package  to  support  the  efficacy  of  BUCCOLAM  comprises  bibliographic  data  only.  The 
efficacy dataset defined from the literature search comprises: 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 29/47
 
 
 
  A total of 9 efficacy/safety studies in the target population (children with acute seizures) treated 
with buccal midazolam: 
  5 comparator controlled studies (1 vs intravenous diazepam, 4 vs rectal diazepam 
  4  non-controlled  studies  on  the  buccal  route  of  administration  of  the  (‘Hypnovel’)  midazolam 
aqueous solution, currently marketed for intravenous use in children. 
  Supportive studies in the target population but where midazolam had been administered by the 
parenteral or nasal route and a study in adults on the buccal route. 
For  ethical  reasons,  placebo-controlled  comparative  trials  of  midazolam  in  children  with  seizures  are 
not  available.  Therefore,  the  controlled  studies  included  are  comparative  with  either  IV  Diazepam  or 
rectal diazepam. 
In  table  5  an  overview  of the  studies with  single dose  buccal  midazolam  versus  rectal  or intravenous 
diazepam  in  treatment  of  children  with  acute  seizures  is  presented.  All  studies  included  diazepam 
treatment as comparator. 
All  pivotal  trials  used  a  single  buccal  dose  of  about  0,25–0,5  mg  /kg  body  weight  midazolam  in 
10mg/2ml.  solution  (Roche  IV  injection).  In  two  studies  this  was  dosed  as  a  fixed  dose  according  to 
age stratum: 2.5mg: 3-11mths, 5mg: 1-4 yrs, 7.5mg: 5-9 yrs, 10mg: >10 yrs. Rectal diazepam was 
used as active comparator in four pivotal studies. In two of these four studies it was dosed according 
to  age  identical  to  midazolam  dosing,  which  is  claimed  by  Applicant  to  be  broadly  in  line  with  the 
authorised dose of 0.5 mg / kg. In one study rectal diazepam was dosed either at 0.5mg/kg (<5 yrs.) 
or 0.3 mg/kg (>5 yrs). Applicant argues that dosing by body weight is not feasible in the community 
and emergency settings and therefore a fixed dose product, banded by age (and as suggested by EMA 
Scientific Advice) is proposed as investigated in the pivotal studies. However, in the studies by Baysun 
et al. and by Talukdar et al. dosages of buccal midazolam and intravenous diazepam were calculated 
by weight. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  pivotal  studies  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  buccal 
midazolam  to  rectal  diazepam  in  the  treatment  of  prolonged  seizures  in  children.  Objectives  such  as 
assessment of superiority or non-inferiority of buccal midazolam as compared to rectal or intravenous 
diazepam were not specified, but the power calculations suggest the objective of superiority testing. 
Primary endpoint was cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes in the study by Scott at al. 
and  the  study  by  Baysun  et  al.  In  the  Scott  study  the  endpoint  was  defined  as:  “cessation  of  visible 
epileptic phenomena and the return of purposeful response to external stimuli”. Primary endpoint was 
cessation  of  visible  signs  of  seizure  activity  within  10  minutes  without  recurrence  in  the  subsequent 
hour in the Mpimbaza study and the McIntyre study. The Mpimbaza study included an evaluation of the 
risk  for  seizure  recurrence  over  24  hours  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  Primary  endpoint  in  the  Talukdar 
study was cessation of visible seizure activity within 5 minutes. This was the only pivotal study that did 
not include cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes as either the primary or a secondary 
endpoint. 
In table 6 the age distribution within the studies is presented. 
Acute convulsive seizures of all types were included. Partial seizures were included in all trials except 
the McIntyre trial. In the McIntyre trial seizures had lasted for 30 minutes (Buccolam, 10-49 min.) to 
41  (diazepam,  10-61  min.)  before  start  of  treatment.  Mpimbaza  et  al  reported  that  in  their  trial  269 
(81.5%) convulsions were generalized and 61 (18.5%) were focal. In the Scott study 24 of 40 seizures 
were  generalised  in  the  Buccolam  group  and  22  out  of  39  seizures  in  the  diazepam  group.  On  the 
Baysun trial it was reported that ‘the most common type of convulsive episode was generalized tonic-
clonic  seizures’.  In  the  Talukdar  report  partial  seizures  were  included  but  proportion  of  patients  by 
seizure type were not reported.

Results 
In table 7 the results from the individual studies and meta-analyses are presented. See also figures 3 
and 4 below. The percentage cessation of seizure activity within 10 minutes ranged between 56 and 78 
% for buccal midazolam and 41 - 85% for rectal diazepam. Differences by treatment were statistically 
significant in favour of midazolam in the meta-analyses.

In addition a meta-analysis over the studies conducted by Mpimbaza, McIntyre, Scott and Baysun was 
performed. The risk ratio was statistically significant in favour of midazolam (Weighted Risk Ratio 1.21, 
p=0.0005,  fixed  effect  model).  There  was  a  substantial  heterogeneity  in  the  pooled  data  from  the 
Mpimbaza,  McIntyre  and  Scott  studies  (I2≥  70%)  but  this  disappeared  when  patients  with  malaria 
were excluded from the analysis ((I2=0%). 
Table 8 
A  pooled  analysis  of  treatment  response  (cessation  of  seizure  activity  within  10  minutes  without 
recurrence  within  one  hour)  in  the  Mpimbaza  and  McIntyre  study  also  indicated  superiority  of  buccal 
midazolam (WRR 1.42, p<0.00001). 
Onset of effect 
In the McIntyre study, median time to cessation of seizure activity was 8 minutes for midazolam and 
15 minutes for rectal diazepam (p=0.01). In the Scott study these rates were 6 minutes and 8 minutes 
respectively (NS). In the Baysun study there were no statistically significant differences in the median 
response period. 
In  the  Scott  study,  one  patient  with  15  treated  seizures  and  one  with  24  treated  seizures  were 
analysed separately. The first of these two patients was treated 8 times with midazolam and 7 times 
with  diazepam.  The  other  patient  was  treated  12  times  with  each  product.  In  both  patients  average 
time from drug administration to end of seizure did not differ between drugs.

In the Talukdar study time to onset of drug effect (counted from treatment initiation) was significantly 
shorter  for  intravenous  diazepam.  However,  total  time  to  onset  of  seizure  control  was  significantly 
shorter  for  midazolam  due  to  time  needed  to  establish  venous  access.  It  was  reported  that  it  took 
‘quite  some  time  to  get  an  intravenous  line  in  place’  in  some  patients,  especially  infants.  Treatment 
initiation within 1 minute was achieved only in case of midazolam treatment (12 out of 60 treatments. 
Treatment initiation within 1-2 minutes was achieved in most (46 out of 60) midazolam treatments but 
only 14 out of 60 intravenous diazepam treatments. Treatment preparation between 2 and 3 minutes 
was  required  in  32  diazepam  treatments  but  only  2  midazolam  treatments,  and  3  to  4  minutes 
preparation was required for another 11 diazepam treatments (but no midazolam treatments). Among 
51  seizures  controlled  within  5  minutes  using  buccal  midazolam  and  56  seizures  controlled  within  5 
minutes using intravenous diazepam, total controlling time of less than 2 minutes was achieved in 11 
patients using buccal diazepam versus 2 patients receiving intravenous diazepam. Controlling time of 
four  or  five  minutes  occurred  in  8  patients  receiving  buccal  midazolam  versus  13  patients  receiving 
intravenous  diazepam.  Most  seizures  were  controlled  in  2-4  minutes.  As  no  observer  blinding  was 
performed  in  any  of  these  studies  these  result  must  be  interpreted  with  caution.  A  claim  of  earlier 
onset of the effect is considered not justified. 
See table below. 
Table 9 
24-hour maintenance of effect 
In the Mpimbaza study the rate of recurrence of seizure activity was studied. In treatment responders 
these  rates  were  8%  for  midazolam  and  17.5%  for  rectal  diazepam  (p=0.026)  for  recurrence  within 
one  hour  and  39,1%  versus  46,3%  for  a  24-hour  period  (NS).  Median  time  to  recurrence  was  5.11 
hour for midazolam and 1.81 hour for rectal diazepam (p=0.001). Response times differed statistically 
significant in favour of midazolam in malaria patients as well. It is noted that based on the differences 
in t½ of midazolam and diazepam the opposite would have been expected. 
2.5.2.  Supportive studies 
Supportive  studies  were  four  uncontrolled  studies  using  buccal  midazolam  in  children  demonstrating 
both efficacy and safety, and a small uncontrolled study among 10 adult encephalopatic patients using 
a  5  mg  buccal  midazolam  dose  yielding  cessation  of  seizure  activity  within  2  minutes  in 80.7%  of  all 
cases. 
Five  controlled  studies  conducted  with  intravenous  midazolam  (0.2  mg/kg  average  parenteral  dose) 
among  106  children  demonstrated  efficacy  and  safety  in  comparison  with  parenteral  diazepam, 
lignocaine or rectal sodium valproate. 
In addition, the Applicant submitted five additional controlled studies comparing intranasal midazolam 
(0.2  mg/kg)  with  intravenous  or  rectal  diazepam  in  the  treatment  of  214  seizures  in  140  children, 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 34/47
 
 
 
 
which reported intranasal midazolam to be as effective and safe as diazepam. Ten further uncontrolled 
studies of intranasal midazolam supported those results. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clonazepam are well established treatments of epileptic 
and  febrile  seizures.  Midazolam  is  also  a  benzodiazepine,  used  primarily  for  purposes  of  sedation  in 
elective surgery also in children and is known for its rapid onset of action. 
Clinical  efficacy  is  based  on  literature  data.  Five  published  comparative  studies  were  submitted 
evaluating treatment of acute seizures in children with buccal midazolam. 
Overall the studies have several methodological flaws i.e. no double blinding, no placebo control and in 
some  studies  no  adequate  randomisation.  It  is  questioned  whether,  with  the  exception  of  the 
randomisation, these flaws could have been avoided given the urgency of acute seizure treatment.  
It should be noted that older children in each age-band (i.e. children aged 11 months or 4 or 9 years 
old)  in  the  pivotal  studies  received  only  about  0.25  mg/kg  of  the  active  comparator.  Most  guidelines 
recommend  dosage  of  rectal  diazepam  for  acute  (non-febrile)  seizures  at  0.5  mg/kg.  For  tonic-clonic 
status  epilepticus  even  higher  rectal  diazepam  dosage  (0.5  –  1  mg/kg)  has  been  recommended.  
Therefore,  effect  sizes  in  the  studies  may  be  artificially  inflated  in  favour  of  buccal  midazolam. 
Although superiority of buccal midazolam over rectal diazepam is not justified on these grounds, non-
inferiority  appears  sufficiently  plausible  and  suffices  in  view  of  the  practical  advantages  of  buccal 
administration for the benefit risk ratio. 
With  respect  to  types  and  duration  of  seizures  this  was  rather  heterogeneous.  In  most  study  reports 
the duration of seizures at the start of treatment was not specified. However, it is reasonable to expect 
that in an emergency room and specialised residence setting only seizures that require treatment with 
a benzodiazepine will be treated, but for the community setting this is ambiguous. 
Not all acute seizures develop into status epilepticus and particularly partial seizures without impaired 
consciousness  may  rapidly  resolve  spontaneously.  In  most  pivotal  studies  only  initial  response  to 
treatment  was  described,  partly  concerning  partial  seizures  without  observed  (secondary) 
generalisation  or  perseverance  into  SE.  In  all  but  one  pivotal  study  no  recurrence  rates  of  seizure 
symptoms have been reported, though rebound effects of short-acting midazolam may actually lower 
the  cortical  seizure  threshold  after  initial  treatment,  possibly increasing  risk  of  development  of  status 
epilepticus  in  the  post-treatment  period.  Therefore  lowering  the  risk  of  complications  of  status 
epilepticus  has  not  been  shown  in  four  out  of  five  pivotal  trials.  Therefore,  the  claim  that  midazolam 
reduces the risk of status epilepticus, is not justified by data as this has formally not been evaluated. 
Hence, only a claim of treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures is acceptable. 
The  common  outcome  parameter  in  the  four  pivotal  studies  comparing  Buccolam  to  rectal  diazepam 
was  cessation  of  seizure  activity  within  ten  minutes.  Only  one  of  these  four  pivotal  studies 
demonstrated  significant  and  clinically  relevant  superiority  of  buccal  midazolam  over  rectal  diazepam 
on  that  parameter.  A  non-significant  trend  in  favour  of  midazolam  was  observed  in  two  other  pivotal 
studies using rectal diazepam as comparator. 
Two pivotal studies report significant superiority of midazolam for the primary endpoint of termination 
of seizure activity and prevention of recurrence of convulsions for one hour period. 
The  meta-analysis  of  the  results  of  the  pivotal  studies  suggests  a  significant  benefit  of  buccal 
midazolam over rectal diazepam in the treatment of acute seizures in children and adolescents showing 
termination  of  seizure  activity  within  10-minutes.  The  result  appears  to  be  independent  of  variables 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 35/47
 
 
 
such  as  initial  versus  recurrent  seizure,  use  of  antiepileptic  medication  or  use  of  rescue  medication 
prior  to  trial  treatment.  Though  placebo  comparisons  have  not  been  performed  for  ethical  reasons, 
clinical  superiority  or  at  least  non-inferiority  as  compared  to  standard  treatment  suffices  as  evidence 
for  efficacy.    As  stated  above  superiority  of  buccal  midazolam  over  rectal  diazepam  might  not  be 
justified. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that non-inferiority appears plausible. 
Results  of  the  supportive  studies  that  were  referred  to  by  the  Applicant  were  in  accordance  with  the 
results  of  the  pivotal  studies  and  there  were  no  submitted  studies  suggesting  inferiority  of  buccal 
midazolam in comparison with standard treatments. 
Although one pivotal study reported a faster onset of effect of buccal midazolam as compared to rectal 
diazepam,  this  result  is  highly  prone  to  observer  bias  as  the  study  was  not  blind.  Therefore  these 
results should be interpreted with caution. Claims of earlier onset of the effect are not justified. 
However in the pivotal study using intravenous diazepam as comparator total controlling time was also 
shorter for buccal midazolam. Although subject to observer bias as well, this result does highlight the 
disadvantage of intravenous treatments i.e. time needed to gain venous access that may delay onset 
of  action  and  termination  of  seizure  activity,  indicating  the  potential  benefit  of  both  rectal  diazepam 
and buccal midazolam even in the emergency room setting. 
The posology section of the SmPC of rectal diazepam recommends administration of a second dose in 
refractory cases whereas efficacy of buccal midazolam has been demonstrated for single use only, and 
the proposed SmPC recommends single use. In the Mpimbaza study the rate of recurrence of seizure 
activity  within  one  hour  was  8%  for  midazolam  and  17.5%  for  rectal  diazepam  (p=0.026)  and 
recurrence within 24 hour 39,1%  and 46,3% respectively. 
Although  this  indicates  less  need  for  retreatment  under  midazolam  in  case  of  treatment  failure,  the 
Applicant  calculated  that  a  second  dose  administered  at  10,  30  and  60  minutes  after  the  first  dose 
results in an increase of the Cmax with an factor 1.6 to 2 after 10 minutes, 1.2 to 2 after 30 minutes 
and  a  less  pronounced  increase  of  Cmax  after  60  minutes.  Therefore  re-treatment  of  midazolam  in 
case  of  non-response  is  not  recommended  and  can  only  take  place  under  medical  supervision  in 
emergency medical setting. 
The clinical studies were all performed in an emergency room or residence setting. However, the rates 
of observed respiratory depression were similar for Buccolam and rectal diazepam. As rectal diazepam 
has  been  safely  used  in  the  community  on  an  extensive  scale,  midazolam  can  be  expected  to  show 
similar safety. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Although the pivotal studies are may have several methodological flaws as they were not designed as 
registration trials, overall these trials support the clinical efficacy of buccal midazolam in the treatment 
of acute seizures in children and adolescents irrespective of cause, with a magnitude of effect similar to 
standard  treatments,  a  sufficiently  rapid  onset  of  effect  and  some  evidence  for  efficacy  in  the 
prevention  of  recurrence  of  seizures  up  to  24  hours.  Re-treatment  should  only  be  applied  under 
medical supervision in emergency medical setting. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  profile  of  midazolam  (and  other  benzodiazepines)  from  the  authorised  uses  is  well 
established.  The  main  adverse  effects  associated  with  midazolam  and  precautions  applicable  to  the 
buccal  route  of  administration  in  children  include  cardiorespiratory  adverse  events  (respiratory 
depression,  apnoea,  respiratory  arrest  and/or  cardiac  arrest),  anterograde  amnesia,  and  paradoxical 
Buccolam

reactions.  Precautions  are  required  for  patients  with  impaired  respiratory  function  or  cardiovascular 
instability.  Paediatric  patients  less  than  6  months  of  age  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  airway 
obstruction and hypoventilation. 
The Clinical Safety data package to support the PUMA application comprises: 
  published (efficacy/) safety data from studies in children with acute seizures treated 
with buccal midazolam, together with supportive data from studies of midazolam by 
other administration routes 
supportive (efficacy/) safety data from published studies in adults treated with buccal 
midazolam for the same indication 
 
Together with: 
 
 
 
safety  data  from  the  pharmacokinetic  study  conducted  with  the  proposed  buccal 
formulation (BUCCOLAM) in 53 children (MID001) 
safety  data  from  published  studies  in  18  adults  with  buccal  midazolam  which  have 
been used to support the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic sections  
clinical  experience  from  systemic/oral  exposure  of  children  and  adults  to  midazolam  for 
currently approved indications in EU and USA for Hypnovel and Versed, respectively.

Following  buccal  midazolam,  respiratory  depression  occurred  in  1.5%  of  treated  patients  in  the 
Mpimbaza study. In that study, respiratory depression was defined as a persistent decrease in oxygen 
saturation to <92% or a decrease in respiratory effort sufficient to warrant assisted breathing. In the 
McIntyre  study,  respiratory  depression  was  defined  as  a  fall  in  oxygen  saturation  or  decrease  in 
respiratory effort sufficient to require assisted breathing. This occurred in about 5% of midazolam- as 
well as diazepam-treated patients in that study, amounting to 5 children requiring intubation. Whether 
these  cases  of  respiratory  depression  were  related  to  the  product  or  the  treated  seizure  was  not 
reported.  Frequency  of  respiratory  depression  was  not  reported  by  Scott  et  al.,  but  median  oxygen 
saturation  was  reported  to  be  97%  in  both  groups,  with  a  lowest  recorded  saturation  of  93%  after 
midazolam  treatment,  returning  to  normal  within  2  minutes.  In  the  Baysun  study,  1  patient  had 
bradypnea and oxygen saturation of 84% at 5 minutes after rectal diazepam, returning to normal at 10 
minutes. Baysun et al. report that they did not observe any cardio respiratory events in either group. 
Most  published  studies  only  stated  that  no  severe  events  had  been  reported,  or  that  there  was  no 
significant  difference  between  the  2  treatments.  In  the  five  pivotal  studies  the  safety  of  buccal 
midazolam was stated to be equal to the comparator. In the reviewed studies using buccal midazolam, 
four  AE’s  were  reported  among  a  total  of  443  children,  one  of  which  (pruritus)  was  attributed  to  the 
product. See table 11 below.

In  the  Mpimbaza  study  6.1%  deaths  were  reported  (20  patients:  rectal  diazepam  12;  buccal 
midazolam  8  (NS)),  which  were  attributed  to  underlying  diseases/illness.  Malaria  was  diagnosed  in 
67.3% of treated patients as the underlying cause of febrile seizures.

In  the  PK-study,  using  doses  below  the  target  dose  in  53  patients,  55  AE’s  were  reported  by  39 
patients.  Two  adverse  events  in  two  patients  were  considered  related  to  treatment:  vomiting 
(moderate, related to midazolam), and nausea (mild, probably also related). No obvious difference in 
adverse event reporting pattern was reported across the different age groups. No events were reported 
for any patient in the 7 days following treatment. Two adverse events had led to discontinuation and 
withdrawal  from  the  PK-study:  one  case  of  nausea  which  resulted  in  the  patient  spitting  out  the 
medication;  and  one  case  of  vomiting  (discussed  above).  Three  AE’s  indicated  possible  respiratory 
depression: one case of mild bronchospasm, a case of increased upper airways secretion and one case 
of  moderate  pulmonal  obstruction.  These  were  rated  as  unrelated  to  midazolam  in  these  patients 
undergoing  surgical  procedures.  One  case  of  severe  bradycardia  occurring  almost  two  hours  after 
study medication was also considered to be unrelated. The most common AE’s were pain and vomiting 
post-operatively. 
In  this  study,  the  oromucosal  tissue  at  the  site(s)  to  be  used  for  the  buccal  administration  was 
examined  visually  by  the  investigator  at  baseline  (pre-dose)  and  prior  to  discharge  for  any  local 
clinically relevant changes. There were no reports of local irritation. This is stated to be consistent with 
a PSUR on midazolam oral syrup marketed in the US from 1998 until 2002. 
In the studies using intranasal midazolam, in about 300 treated children, there were more AE’s: a case 
of  tachypnoea,  one  tachycardia,  two  patients  with  shallow  breathing  and  one  with  respiratory 
depression,  one  case  of  increased  heart  rate  and  one  of  increased  respiratory  rate  together  with 
decreased heart rate, a case of dizziness and a patient with skin irritation. 
In a 2002 Indian study (Singhi et al., 2002) using parenteral midazolam, hypotension occurred in 29% 
of  children  treated  with  midazolam  versus  37%  in  those  treated  with  intravenous  diazepam.  In  that 
study 19% and 16% suffered respiratory depression after midazolam a diazepam respectively. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  the  Mpimbaza  study  6.1%  deaths  were  reported  (20  patients  in  total:  12  patients  receiving  rectal 
diazepam and 8 patients receiving buccal midazolam (NS)). These deaths were attributed to underlying 
diseases/illness. Malaria was diagnosed in 67.3% of treated patients as the underlying cause of febrile 
seizures.  Causes of death were eight cases of cerebral malaria and two cases of malaria with severe 
anaemia,  three  patients  with  severe  malnutrition,  three  cases  of  septicaemia  and  two  with  HIV-
associated pneumonia and two patients with meningitis. 
In  the  2002  study  by  Singhi  et  al.  using  intravenous  midazolam,  8  patients  died  in  the  midazolam 
group  (5  meningo-encephalitis,  1  acute  hyponatremia  due  to  diarrhoea,  1  hepatic  encephalopathy,  1 
unspecified). One further death (cause not specified) following intravenous midazolam was reported in 
a  study  in  neonates  (Boylan  et  al.,  2004).  No  deaths  were  reported  in  28  adults  treated  with  buccal 
midazolam in 3 studies, and in about 300 children treated with intranasal midazolam. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no reports on laboratory findings in the submitted dossier. Laboratory evaluation in the PK-
study was considered ‘not applicable’. 
Safety in special populations 
There  were  no  reports  on  safety  in  children  with  renal,  hepatic  or  cardiac  impairment  in  the  dossier, 
though it is suggested that clearance of midazolam may be affected in some cases.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
For interactions, the Applicant refers to studies on the originator product. In these studies inducers of 
CYP3A4  (rifampicin,  carbamazepine,  and  phenytoin)  markedly  decreased  (>90%)  the  Cmax  and  AUC 
and  pharmacologic  effects  of  oral  midazolam.  Erythromycin,  fluconazole,  diltiazem,  verapamil,  and 
especially    ketoconazole  and  itraconazole,  all  markedly  increased  midazolam  Cmax  and  AUC  and 
pharmacologic effect, with up to a possible 10 to 15-fold increase in AUC for 200 mg/day itraconazol 
and  400  mg/day  ketoconazol  respectively.  Grapefruit  juice,  cimetidine  and  ranitidine  cause  moderate 
increase in midazolam plasma concentration. However, no serious consequences are expected from the 
potential  interaction  with  Cytochrome  p450  3A4  inhibitors,  considering  the  broad  therapeutic  window 
of  midazolam  and  midazolam  oromucosal  solution  is  only  administered  as  a  single  dose  according  to 
the proposed indication. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Due to the single dose nature of treatment of acute seizures this is not applicable in most trials. Two 
adverse events had led to discontinuation and withdrawal from the PK-study: one case of nausea which 
resulted in the patient spitting out the medication; and one case of vomiting. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data referred to by the Applicant as well as the submitted data are limited. However, even if the 
data submitted are limited, the safety profile of midazolam is well known, and the data submitted allow 
concluding  that  buccal  midazolam  is  generally  and  locally  well  tolerated  in  children  in  the  proposed 
age-stratified dosage.  
However,  given  that  there  is  a  risk  of  delayed  respiratory  depression  as  a  result  of  high  metabolite 
concentrations in the 3-6 months age group, infants between 3-6 months of age treatment should be 
in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available. The CHMP 
also  noted  that  even  if  the  data  presented  support  the  age  stratified  dosage,  in  adolescents  (>  12 
years  of  age  (>  40  kg  weight)  there  is  a  potential  risk  of  under  dosing  based  on  the  PK  results. 
Therefore,  this  point  has  been  addressed  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  will  be  followed  up  in 
PSURs as a special item. 
Clinical safety data (post-marketing and development data) have been made available to the Applicant 
by  the  originator  company  (Hoffman-La  Roche).  It  is  estimated  that  >32  million  paediatric  patients 
have been treated with IV or IM formulations of midazolam from the time of introduction in September 
1982  until  April  30,  1997,  and  that  874  million  patients  (children  and  adults)  were  treated  with 
parenteral  or  oral  formulations  of  midazolam  in  the  10-year  period  from  May  1998  –  August  2008. 
Findings  in  the  post-marketing  data  are  in  accordance  with  the  reference  safety  information  for 
midazolam  as  summarised  in  the  proposed  SPC.    Literature  data  on  respiratory  depression  reported 
with midazolam use was submitted confirming this adverse effect to be rare and generally benign.  In 
a total of 69 studies on use of oral midazolam as premedication prior to anesthesia in children (2400 
patients) only six cases of respiratory depression or excessive sedation were reported, and no reported 
deaths  or  serious  sequel  secondary  to  hypoventilation  in  all  published  studies  on  oral  midazolam  in 
paediatric patients and two Roche sponsored studies in 508 patients together. In a study by Alldredge 
et al published in 2001, out-of-hospital treatment of status epilepticus in adults using benzodiazepines 
were  studied  in  comparison  with  placebo.  In  that  study  a  trend  towards  fewer  complications  in  the 
active treatment groups was found.

In  relation  to  the  packaging,  the  CHMP  had  concerns  that  parents,  carers,  or  patients  will  carry  the 
secondary  packaging  (one  tube  containing  the  syringe)  instead  of  the  entire  carton  and  will not  have 
the  Patient  Leaflet  available  at  all  time.  Since,  there  is  insufficient  space  to  have  all  the  information 
from the outer carton on the tube, the CHMP recommended ViroPharma investigate the attachment of 
a  Patient  Leaflet  to  the  secondary  packaging  or  the  extension  of  the  label  to  include  further 
information. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety  data  drawn  from  published  studies  using  midazolam  in  all  age-groups  and  the  PK  study 
conducted  by  the  Applicant,  confirm  the  safety  of  the  proposed  dose  recommendations  for  children 
from  6  months  of  age  to  18  yeasrs.  However,  as  stated  before,  there  is  a  risk  that  children  younger 
than 6 months of age are more vulnerable to respiratory insufficiency and hypoventilation as compared 
to children older children. Since there are insufficient data to support the safe use in children between 
3 to 6 months of age in the community setting, when used  by  parents or cares, it is advised to limit 
the  use  of  midazolam  in  the  3  to  6  month  age  group  to  the  hospital  setting  where  monitoring  is 
possible and resuscitation equipment is available.

The SPC provides information and warnings 
in 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
indicating that insufficient data are available 
on midazolam to assess its safety during 
pregnancy and that Midazolam should be 
used in pregnancy only if clearly necessary.  
Breast-feeding   Midazolam passes in low 
quantities (0.6%) into breast milk.  As a 
result it may not be necessary to stop breast 
feeding following a single dose of 
midazolam.   
Fertility      Animal  studies  did  not  show  an 
impairment of fertility (See section 5.3).

Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Based  on  the  clinical  data  submitted,  midazolam  showed  efficacy  in  termination  of  acute  prolonged 
seizures (any visible sign of convulsions) at 0.25-0.5 mg/kg bodyweight buccal in children 3 months - 
18 years old in emergency room and specialized residential settings.  At least midazolam is considered 
non-inferior  and  possibly  superior  efficacy  to  rectal  diazepam  (i.e.  current  non-intravenous  seizure 
treatment). 
Buccolam  is  presented  in  a  new  dosage  form  developed  for  buccal  use  in  children.  The  route  of 
administration is better assessable compared to the intravenous route and rectal use. Compared to the 
intravenous  route,  the  onset  of  action  may  be  slightly  later.  However  taking  into  account  the  time 
needed  to  get  access  to  the  intravenous  route,  especially  in  children,  there  is  less  time  to  seizure 
control as no time is lost for gaining intravenous access. Compared to the rectal, route there is a larger 
social acceptability. 
Midazolam given bucally has a favourable local tolerability. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Superiority as compared to rectal diazepam has not been established. 
Whether  midazolam  decreases  seizure  recurrence  rates  is  unclear.  Seizure  recurrence  rates  in  initial 
treatment  responders  were  reported  in  only  one  study.  The  results  appear  in  favour  of  buccal 
midazolam but conflicts with the much faster clearance of midazolam. 
Benefits were only demonstrated in the emergency room and specialised residential setting. 
Unfavourable effects 
The major risk of midazolam and its active metabolite is the risk of respiratory depression. 
There might be a risk of overtreatment due to misclassification i.e. treatment of self-limiting (partial) 
seizures of short duration. This may induce unnecessary sedation. 
Buccolam 
Assessment report  
EMA/662938/2011  
Page 45/47
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The reporting of adverse events in the dossiers appears limited. In is unclear how adverse events were 
assessed in the pivotal studies and whether underreporting has been excluded. 
Uncertainty  persists  whether  respiratory  failure  has  occurred  in  fatal  cases  in  the  post-marketing 
database on oral and intravenous midazolam in children undergoing elective surgery. 
Uncertainty persists whether a second gift after non-responsiveness or recurrence respiratory failure is 
safe especially with respect respiratory depression. 
There  are  insufficient  data  to  support  the  safe  use  in  children  between  3-  6  months  of  age  in  the 
community  setting.  It  can  not  be  excluded  that  these  infants  are  more  vulnerable  to  respiratory 
insufficiency and hypoventilation as compared to children elder than 6 months of age. 
Given  the  proposed  posology,  there  is  a  potential  risk  that  adolescents  (>12  years  of  age,  weights 
above 40 kg) might be under dosed. 
Benefit-risk balance 
On the whole the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Efficacy of midazolam in termination of acute prolonged seizures in children has been established. The 
termination  of  prolonged  seizures  by  the  simple  and  socially  acceptable  intervention  of  buccal 
administration  of  midazolam  adds  an  important  means  to  prevent  complications  of  paediatric  status 
epilepticus to the existing treatment options. 
The risk of respiratory failure is comparable to current treatments. The risk of overtreatment is limited 
by the constraints included in the indication-statements. 
As  it  can  not  be  excluded  that  these  infants  are  more  vulnerable  to  respiratory  insufficiency  and 
hypoventilation  the  use  of  midazolam  in  children  3-6  months  of  age  needs  to  be  limited  to  the 
emergency room setting as where respiratory function can be monitored and equipment for respiratory 
assistance, if needed, is available. In addition, the Applicant should add children of less than 6 months 
of  age  to  the  list  of  important  missing  information  In  the  RMP  for  at  least  closely  monitoring,  signal 
detection and discussion in PSURs. 
Given  the  proposed  posology,  there  is  a  potential  risk  that  adolescents  (>12  years  of  age,  weights 
above 40 kg) might be under dosed. This should be added as a potential risk in the RAMP and will be 
addressed in Spurs as a special point of attention.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cobicistat, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
Increased levels of lurasidone, such as in overdose, is potentially associated with cardiac arrhythmias 
due to QT prolongation, seizures and cardiovascular collapse. The Latuda (lurasidone) SmPC currently 
contraindicates coadministration with cobicistat, and cobicistat containing products Symtuza and 
Rezolsta include contraindications for lurasidone, however, these CIs are not included in the product 
information for Evotaz, Genvoya, Stribild or Tybost. Given the potentially serious nature of the 
interaction and the fact the contraindication is already included in several cobicistat containing product 
information, it is considered appropriate to also specifically include the contraindication in the Tybost 
SmPC. 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add the contraindication/warning of co-administration 
with lurasidone. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cobicistat the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cobicistat is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required for patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data 
are available in patients with severe renal impairment. Renal impairment had no clinically relevant 
effect on the exposure of oritavancin (see section 5.2), however caution should be exercised when 
prescribing oritavancin in patients with severe renal impairment. Oritavancin is not removed from 
blood by haemodialysis procedures. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B) (see section 5.2). The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been evaluated, however based on pharmacokinetic 
parameters, severe hepatic impairment is not expected to have an impact on oritavancin exposure. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required, even if caution should be exercised when prescribing 
oritavancin to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of oritavancin in paediatric patients < 3 months of age have not yet been 
established.   
Method of administration  
Intravenous use. 
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg) that: 
• 
• 
• 
compatible diluents. 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin. 
Have different recommended duration of infusion. 
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and 
Carefully follow the recommended posology (see section 4.2) and the instructions on reconstitution 
and dilution for Tenkasi 400 mg before administration (see section 6.6). 
Each of the three 400 mg vials should first be reconstituted with 40 mL of sterile water for injection 
(WFI). The reconstituted solutions should be withdrawn and added to a 1 000 mL glucose 5% 
intravenous bag (D5W) for an intravenous infusion over 3 hours (see section 6.6). 
Only D5W should be used for dilution. Sodium chloride solution should not be used for dilution (see 
section 6.2) 
Refer to Tenkasi 1 200 mg for relevant information on the other oritavancin medicinal product.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Use of intravenous unfractionated heparin sodium is contraindicated for 120 hours (5 days) after 
oritavancin administration, because the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test results may 
remain falsely elevated for up to 120 hours after oritavancin administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock have been 
reported with the use of oritavancin. If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin 
infusion, oritavancin should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care should be 
instituted.  
No data are available on cross-reactivity between oritavancin and other glycopeptides, including 
vancomycin. Before using oritavancin, it is important to inquire carefully about previous 
hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin, telavancin). Due to the possibility of 
cross-hypersensitivity, there should be careful monitoring of patients with any history of glycopeptide 
hypersensitivity during and after the infusion. 
Infusion related reactions 
Oritavancin is given via intravenous infusion over 3 hours, to minimise the risk of infusion-related 
reactions. Intravenous infusions of oritavancin can cause reactions such as flushing of the upper body, 
urticaria, pruritus and/or rash. Infusion-associated reactions characterised by chest pain, chest 
discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, neck pain, dyspnoea, hypoxia, abdominal pain, and fever have 
been observed with the use of oritavancin, including after the administration of more than one dose of 
oritavancin during a single course of therapy. If reactions do occur, stopping or slowing the infusion 
may result in cessation of these symptoms (see section 4.8). 
Need for additional antibacterial agents 
Oritavancin is active against Gram-positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where 
Gram-negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, oritavancin should be co-
administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s). 
Concomitant use of warfarin 
Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised 
ratio (INR) for up to 12 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of warfarin 
unreliable up to 12 hours after an oritavancin dose.  
Interference with assay for coagulation tests  
Oritavancin has been shown to interfere with certain laboratory coagulation tests (see sections 4.3 and 
4.5).  Oritavancin concentrations that are found in the blood of patients following administration of a 
single dose have been shown to artificially prolong: 
•  aPTT for up to 120 hours,  
•  PT and INR for up to 12 hours,  
•  Activated Clotting Time (ACT) for up to 24 hours, 
•  Silica Clot Time (SCT) for up to 18 hours, and 
•  Dilute Russell’s Viper Venom Test (DRVVT) for up to 72 hours. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
These effects result from oritavancin binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid reagents 
which activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. For patients who require 
aPTT monitoring within 120 hours of oritavancin dosing, a non-phospholipid-dependent coagulation 
test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT 
monitoring may be considered.  
The Chromogenic Factor Xa Assay, the Thrombin Time (TT) assay and the assays, used for the 
diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) are not affected by oritavancin. In vitro, 
oritavancin 46.6 μg/mL did not affect an assay for activated protein C resistance (APCR), suggesting 
that there is a low likelihood that oritavancin will interfere with this test. However, APCR is a 
phospholipid-based test and it cannot be ruled out that higher concentrations of oritavancin that may 
occur during clinical use could interfere with this test. 
No effect of oritavancin on the in vivo coagulation system was observed in nonclinical and clinical 
studies. 
Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea 
Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have  been reported for oritavancin 
and  may range in severity from mild to life threatening diarrhoea. Therefore, it is important to 
consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of 
oritavancin (see section 4.8). In such a circumstance, the use of supportive measures together with the 
administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. 
Superinfection  
The use of antibacterial medicinal products may increase the risk of overgrowth of non-susceptible 
microorganisms. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken. 
Osteomyelitis 
In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the oritavancin-treated 
arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of osteomyelitis after administration of oritavancin. If osteomyelitis is suspected or 
diagnosed, appropriate alternative antibacterial therapy should be instituted.  
Abscess 
In the Phase 3 clinical trials, slightly more cases of newly emergent abscesses were reported in the 
oritavancin-treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (4.6% vs 3.4%, respectively) (see section 
4.8). If newly emergent abscesses occur, appropriate measures should be taken.  
Limitations of the clinical data 
In the two major trials in ABSSSI, the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis, abscesses, 
and wound infection only. Other types of infections have not been studied. There is limited experience 
in clinical studies in patients with bacteraemia, peripheral vascular disease, or neutropenia, in 
immunocompromised patients, in patients aged > 65 years, in patients with severe renal impairment 
and in infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes.   
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Substances metabolised by cytochrome P450  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A screening drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy volunteers (n=16) evaluating the 
concomitant administration of a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin with probe substrates for several 
CYP450 enzymes. Oritavancin was found to be a nonspecific, weak inhibitor (CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19) or a weak inducer (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) of several CYP isoforms. 
Caution should be used when administering oritavancin concomitantly with medicinal products with a 
narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by one of the affected CYP450 
enzymes (e.g., warfarin), as co-administration may increase (e.g., for CYP2C9 substrates) or decrease 
(e.g., for CYP2D6 substrates) concentrations of the narrow therapeutic range medicinal product. 
Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity or lack of efficacy if they have been given 
oritavancin while on a potentially affected compound (e.g. patients should be monitored for bleeding, 
if concomitantly receiving oritavancin and warfarin) (see section 4.4). A study to assess the drug-drug 
interaction effect of a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin 
following a single dose was conducted in 36 healthy subjects. S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were 
evaluated following a single dose of warfarin 25 mg given alone, or administered at the start, 24 or 72 
hours after a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin. The results showed no effect of oritavancin on S-
warfarin AUC and Cmax. 
Drug-laboratory test interactions (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) 
Oritavancin binds to and prevents the action of the phospholipid reagents which activate coagulation in 
commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. Oritavancin concentrations achieved in the blood after 
1 200 mg doses may produce falsely elevated results from certain laboratory tests (see Table 2).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of oritavancin 
in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
Tenkasi during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
oritavancin.  
Breastfeeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of oritavancin in milk 
(for details see section 5.3). It is unknown whether oritavancin/metabolites are excreted in human 
milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from Tenkasi 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility due to oritavancin at the highest 
concentrations administered. However, there are no data on the effects of oritavancin on human 
fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tenkasi has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur and this 
may have an effect on driving and use of machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) were: nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, 
infusion site reactions, and headache. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was 
cellulitis (1.1%).  The most common reported reasons for discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%) and 
osteomyelitis (0.3%). Female patients had a higher reporting rate for adverse reactions than male 
patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions for oritavancin from the pooled Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials with single-dose 
oritavancin are listed by system organ class in the following table.   
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 
to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from

Paediatric population 
The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on data from one trial in which 38 patients aged 
from 3 months to 18 years with suspected or confirmed Gram-positive bacterial infection received 
Tenkasi. Overall, the safety profile in these 38 patients was similar to that observed in the adult 
population. The following ADRs not reported in Table 3 for adult patients have been observed in no 
more than 1 paediatric patient: irritability, electrocardiogram QT prolonged (transient, asymptomatic 
and not associated to other ECG abnormalities), Clostridioides difficile colitis (see Section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the clinical programme of 3017 oritavancin-treated subjects, there was no incidence of accidental 
overdose of oritavancin.  
Oritavancin is not removed from blood by haemodialysis procedures. In the event of overdose, 
supportive measures should be taken.

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials, 
ATC code: J01XA05 
Mechanism of action 
Oritavancin has three mechanisms of action: (i) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerisation) 
step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors; (ii) inhibition 
of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the peptide bridging 
segments of the cell wall; and (iii) disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, leading to 
depolarisation, permeabilisation, and rapid cell death.   
Resistance 
Gram-negative organisms are intrinsically resistant to all glycopeptides, including oritavancin. 
Resistance to oritavancin was observed in vitro in vancomycin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus 
aureus. There is no known cross-resistance between oritavancin and non-glycopeptide classes of 
antibiotics. 
Oritavancin exhibits reduced in vitro activity against certain Gram-positive organisms of the genera 
Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus that are intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides.  
Susceptibility testing break points 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:

The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio 
of oritavancin for the infecting organism has been shown to be the parameter that best correlates with 
efficacy. 
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were 
susceptible to oritavancin in vitro. 
Gram-positive microorganisms: 
• 
Staphylococcus aureus  
• 
Streptococcus pyogenes 
• 
Streptococcus agalactiae 
• 
Streptococcus dysgalactiae

• 
Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus) 
Antibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens 
Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies 
suggest that they would be susceptible to oritavancin in the absence of acquired mechanisms of 
resistance: 
•   Beta-haemolytic streptococci of Group G 
•   Clostridium perfringens 
•   Peptostreptococcus spp. 
Paediatric population 
Tenkasi has been evaluated in paediatric patients with ABSSSI in one Phase 1 open-label, multicentre 
trial that included 38 patients aged from 3 months to < 18 years who have been dosed with oritavancin. 
Its objective was to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of an intravenous (IV) infusion of 
oritavancin in patients with a suspected or confirmed Gram-positive bacterial infection who received 
standard antibiotic therapy or in patients receiving peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. The primary 
endpoint was the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC); secondary endpoints include 
safety evaluation and other PK parameters. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tenkasi in paediatric population aged 0 to <3 months in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infections (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Oritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1 200 mg. The mean (±SD) maximum 
oritavancin concentration (Cmax) and AUC0-72 in ABSSSI patients receiving a single 1 200 mg dose is 
112 (±34.5) μg/ml and 1470 (±582) μg•h/mL respectively.   
Distribution 
Oritavancin is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins. Based on population PK analysis, 
the population mean total volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 87.6 L, indicating 
oritavancin is extensively distributed into the tissues.   
Exposures (AUC0-24) of oritavancin in skin blister fluid were 20% of those in plasma after a single 
800 mg dose in healthy subjects. 
Biotransformation 
No metabolites were observed in plasma or bile from oritavancin treated dogs and rats, respectively. 
Additionally, in vitro human liver microsome studies indicated that oritavancin is not metabolised.  
Elimination 
No mass balance study has been conducted in humans. In humans, less than 1% to 5% of the dose was 
recovered as parent active substance in faeces and urine respectively after 2 weeks of collection 
indicating that oritavancin is slowly excreted unchanged.  
The mean terminal elimination plasma half-life of oritavancin is 245 hours (14.9% CV) based on 
population PK analysis of ABSSSI patients receiving a single 1 200 mg dose. The population mean 
total clearance is estimated at 0.445 L/h (27.2 % CV). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a population PK analysis, a relationship between height and clearance was identified, where 
clearance increased with increasing height. Dose modification based on height is not necessary. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin were examined in the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in 
patients with normal renal function, CrCL ≥90 mL/min (n=213), mild renal impairment, 
CrCL 60-89 mL/min (n=59), moderate renal impairment, CrCL 30-59 mL/min (n=22), and severe 
renal impairment CrCL <30 mL/min (n=3). Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that renal 
impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dedicated studies in 
dialysis patients have been conducted. 
Dose adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, 
wheras data on  severe renal impairment are too limited to make dose adjustment recommendation.  
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin were evaluated in a study of subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, n=20) and compared with healthy subjects (n=20) matched for 
gender, age and weight. There were no relevant changes in pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Dose adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. 
Effects of age, weight, gender and race   
Population PK analysis from the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in patients indicated that gender, 
age, weight, or race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dose 
adjustment is warranted in these subpopulations. 
Paediatric population 
Compartmental population PK analysis showed that a dose of 15 mg/kg produced a mean model-
derived AUC0-72 that fell within the adult target range (965 - 2095 μg•h/mL) for all simulated 
paediatric groups ranging from 3 months to <18 years (please refer to Table 5).

The primary adverse effect of oritavancin administration to rats and dogs was a dose related 
accumulation of eosinophilic granules in tissue macrophages including hepatocytes, renal cortical 
epithelial cells, adrenal cells and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. The appearance of the 
eosinophilic granules did not occur following single dose administration and did not significantly 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affect innate macrophage function in vitro at intracellular levels anticipated from a single 1 200 mg 
dose. 
Moderate, dose-related increases in liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) 
were observed in rats and dogs and were shown to be reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
Biochemistry changes associated with kidney function, including decreases in urine specific gravity 
and pH and slight increases in blood urea nitrogen, and sporadic increases in creatinine, were present 
in both rat and dog after treatment of two weeks. Extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen was 
observed in rats. This histopathological finding correlated with an enlargement and an increase in the 
weight of the spleen. The exposure in rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was less to 
only slightly higher than the human exposure based on the AUC. 
Histamine-like infusion reactions following immediately or shortly after dosing with oritavancin 
occurred in both rats and dogs. These reactions were associated with mortality at lower doses in male 
than in female rats in single-dose studies; however, the same gender-related differences were not 
observed in other species. Studies in neonatal rats and dogs for 30 days showed the same tissue effects 
as those seen in adult animals, including sensitivity to the oritavancin-mediated histamine-like infusion 
reactions. Mortality was observed in neonatal rats at slightly lower dosage levels than in adults. 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests on the genotoxic potential did not reveal any clinically 
relevant findings. Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of oritavancin.  
When administered intravenously at doses up to 30 mg/kg, oritavancin did not affect the fertility or 
reproductive performance of male and female rats. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition, 
or postnatal development. There was no evidence of transplacental transfer of oritavancin in pregnant 
rats. The exposure in rats at the NOAEL was less to only slightly higher than the human exposure 
based on the AUC. 
Following a single intravenous infusion in lactating rats, radio-labelled [14C]oritavancin was excreted in 
milk and absorbed by nursing pups.

Incompatibilities 
Sodium chloride solution should not be used for dilution, as it is incompatible with oritavancin 400 mg 
dosage strength and may cause precipitation of the medicinal product. Therefore, other substances, 
additives, or other medicinal products mixed in sodium chloride solution for intravenous use should 
not be added to oritavancin single-use vials or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous 
line or through a common intravenous port. In addition, medicinal products formulated at a basic or 
neutral pH may be incompatible with oritavancin (see section 6.6).

The reconstituted solution should be further diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) intravenous infusion 
bag immediately. 
After dilution 
The diluted solution should be used immediately.  
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than 12 hours at 25 °C and 24 hours at 2 °C -8 °C following dilution in a 
glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Do not store above 25 °C.   
For storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Single-use 50 ml Type 1 glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminium flip off cap. 
3 individual vials are packaged in a carton. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
For single use only. Tenkasi should be prepared under aseptic techniques. 
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg) that: 
• 
• 
• 
compatible diluents. 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin. 
Have different recommended duration of infusion. 
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and 
Carefully follow the recommended instructions for each medicinal product. 
Three Tenkasi 400 mg vials need to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single once-only 
1 200 mg IV dose. 
The powder must be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and the resulting concentrate must be 
diluted in a glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag prior to use. Both the reconstituted solution and the 
diluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. Parenteral medicinal 
products should be inspected visually for particulate matter after reconstitution.  
Adults 
Reconstitution:   
• 
40 mL of sterile water for injection (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to reconstitute 
each vial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that sterile WFI should be added carefully, 
along the walls of the vials. 
Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is 
completely reconstituted in solution.  
• 
• 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dilution: Three reconstituted vials are needed for dilution for administration of a single 1 200 mg 
intravenous infusion. Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution. Sodium 
chloride solution should not be used for dilution (see section 6.2). 
Dilution: 
•  Withdraw and discard 120 mL from a 1 000 mL D5W intravenous bag. 
•  Withdraw 40 mL from each of the three reconstituted vials and add to D5W intravenous bag to 
bring the bag volume to 1 000 mL. This yields a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL of oritavancin. PP 
(Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for administration 
preparation.  
Use in the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 years) 
Calculate the dose of oritavancin required based on patient’s weight (one single infusion of 15 mg/kg 
administered intravenously over 3 hours). 
Determine the number of oritavancin vials that are required for the patient (each vial contains 
oritavancin diphosphate equivalent to 400 mg oritavancin ) 
Reconstitution:   
• 
40 mL of water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to reconstitute each 
vial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that WFI should be added carefully, along the 
walls of the vials. 
Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is 
completely reconstituted in solution.  
• 
• 
Dilution: Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution. Sodium chloride 
solution should not be used for dilution (see section 6.2). 
Dilution: 
Withdraw the necessary volume of oritavancin with a sterile syringe and add to the IV bag containing 
sterile D5W (please refer to table 6 for relevant example). The size of the IV bag will be based on the 
total volume administered. For small volumes a syringe pump may be used.

After reconstitution, 1 ml of the solution contains 30 mg oritavancin. 
After dilution, 1 ml of the solution for infusion contains 4.8 mg oritavancin. 
Excipient with known effect  
Each vial contains 2 400 mg of hydroxypropylbetadex. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). 
White to off-white or pink powder. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tenkasi is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in 
adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
1 200 mg administered as a single dose by intravenous infusion over 1 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required for patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data 
are available in patients with severe renal impairment. Renal impairment had no clinically relevant 
effect on the exposure of oritavancin (see section 5.2), however caution should be exercised when 
prescribing oritavancin in patients with severe renal impairment. Oritavancin is not removed from 
blood by haemodialysis procedures. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) is almost exclusively 
eliminated through the kidneys via glomerular filtration; its pharmacokinetics in patients with severe 
renal impairment has not been evaluated. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B) (see section 5.2). The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been evaluated, however based on pharmacokinetic 
parameters, severe hepatic impairment is not expected to have an impact on oritavancin exposure. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required, even if caution should be exercised when prescribing 
oritavancin to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of oritavancin in children and adolescents (<18 years) have not yet been 
established.  No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Intravenous use. 
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 1 200 mg and Tenkasi 400 mg) that: 
• 
• 
• 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin. 
Have different recommended duration of infusion. 
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and 
compatible diluents. 
Carefully follow the recommended posology (see section 4.2) and the instructions on reconstitution 
and dilution for Tenkasi 1 200 mg before administration (see section 6.6). 
The single 1 200 mg vial should first be reconstituted with 40 mL of sterile water for injections (WFI). 
The reconstituted solution should be withdrawn and added to a 250 mL glucose 5% (D5W) or sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection intravenous bag for an intravenous infusion over 1 
hour (see sections 6.2 and 6.6). 
Refer to Tenkasi 400 mg for relevant information on the other oritavancin medicinal product. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Use of intravenous unfractionated heparin sodium is contraindicated for 120 hours (5 days) after 
oritavancin administration because the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test results may 
remain falsely elevated for up to 120 hours after oritavancin administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock have been 
reported with the use of oritavancin. If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin 
infusion, oritavancin should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care should be 
instituted.  
No data are available on cross-reactivity between oritavancin and other glycopeptides, including 
vancomycin. Before using oritavancin it is important to inquire carefully about previous 
hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin, telavancin). Due to the possibility of 
cross-hypersensitivity, there should be careful monitoring of patients with any history of glycopeptide 
hypersensitivity during and after the infusion. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infusion related reactions 
Oritavancin is given via intravenous infusion over 1 hour to minimise the risk of infusion related 
reactions. Intravenous infusions of oritavancin can cause reactions such as flushing of the upper body, 
urticaria, pruritus and/or rash. Infusion-associated reactions characterised by chest pain, chest 
discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, neck pain, dyspnoea, hypoxia, abdominal pain and fever have 
been observed with the use of oritavancin, including after the administration of more than one dose of 
oritavancin during a single course of therapy. If reactions do occur, stopping or slowing the infusion 
may result in cessation of these symptoms (see section 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
The solubiliser HPβCD is excreted in urine. Clearance of HPβCD may be reduced in patients with 
renal impairment. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 
Need for additional antibacterial agents 
Oritavancin is active against Gram-positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where 
Gram-negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, oritavancin should be co-
administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s). 
Concomitant use of warfarin 
Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised 
ratio (INR) for up to 12 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of warfarin 
unreliable up to 12 hours after an oritavancin dose.  
Interference with assay for coagulation tests  
Oritavancin has been shown to interfere with certain laboratory coagulation tests (see sections 4.3 and 
4.5).  Oritavancin concentrations that are found in the blood of patients following administration of a 
single dose have been shown to artificially prolong: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
aPTT for up to 120 hours,  
PT and INR for up to 12 hours,  
Activated Clotting Time (ACT) for up to 24 hours, 
Silica Clot Time (SCT) for up to 18 hours, and 
Dilute Russell’s Viper Venom Test (DRVVT) for up to 72 hours. 
These effects result from oritavancin binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid reagents 
which activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. For patients who require 
aPTT monitoring within 120 hours of oritavancin dosing, a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation 
test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT 
monitoring may be considered.  
The Chromogenic Factor Xa Assay, the Thrombin Time (TT) assay and the assays used for the 
diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) are not affected by oritavancin. In vitro, 
oritavancin 46.6 μg/mL did not affect an assay for activated protein C resistance (APCR), suggesting 
that there is a low likelihood that oritavancin will interfere with this test. However, APCR is a 
phospholipid-based test and it cannot be ruled out that higher concentrations of oritavancin that may 
occur during clinical use could interfere with this test. 
No effect of oritavancin on the in vivo coagulation system was observed in nonclinical and clinical 
studies.

Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea 
Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have  been reported for oritavancin 
and  may range in severity from mild to life threatening diarrhoea. Therefore, it is important to 
consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of 
oritavancin (see section 4.8). In such a circumstance, the use of supportive measures together with the 
administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. 
Superinfection  
The use of antibacterial medicinal products may increase the risk of overgrowth of non-susceptible 
micro-organisms. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken. 
Osteomyelitis 
In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the oritavancin-treated 
arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of osteomyelitis after administration of oritavancin. If osteomyelitis is suspected or 
diagnosed, appropriate alternative antibacterial therapy should be instituted.  
Abscess 
In the Phase 3 clinical trials, slightly more cases of newly emergent abscesses were reported in the 
oritavancin-treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (4.6% vs 3.4%, respectively) (see section 
4.8). If newly emergent abscesses occur, appropriate measures should be taken.  
Limitations of the clinical data 
In the two major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis, abscesses 
and wound infections only. Other types of infections have not been studied. There is limited 
experience in clinical studies in patients with bacteraemia, peripheral vascular disease or neutropenia, 
in immunocompromised patients, in patients aged > 65 years, in patients with severe renal impairment 
and in infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes.   
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 2 400 mg of hydroxypropylbetadex in each vial which is equivalent to 
9.6 mg/ml.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Substances metabolised by cytochrome P450  
A screening drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy volunteers (n=16) evaluating the 
concomitant administration of a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin with probe substrates for several 
CYP450 enzymes. Oritavancin was found to be a nonspecific, weak inhibitor (CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19) or a weak inducer (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) of several CYP isoforms. 
Caution should be used when administering oritavancin concomitantly with medicinal products with a 
narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by one of the affected CYP450 
enzymes (e.g., warfarin), as co-administration may increase (e.g., for CYP2C9 substrates) or decrease 
(e.g., for CYP2D6 substrates) concentrations of the narrow therapeutic range medicinal product. 
Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity or lack of efficacy if they have been given 
oritavancin while on a potentially affected compound (e.g. patients should be monitored for bleeding, 
if concomitantly receiving oritavancin and warfarin) (see section 4.4). A study to assess the drug-drug 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interaction effect of a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin 
following a single dose was conducted in 36 healthy subjects. S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were 
evaluated following a single dose of warfarin 25 mg given alone, or administered at the start, 24 or 72 
hours after a single 1 200 mg dose of oritavancin. The results showed no effect of oritavancin on S-
warfarin AUC and Cmax. 
Drug-laboratory test interactions (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) 
Oritavancin binds to and prevents the action of the phospholipid reagents which activate coagulation in 
commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. Oritavancin concentrations achieved in the blood after 
1 200 mg doses may produce falsely elevated results from certain laboratory tests (see Table 1).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of oritavancin 
in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
Tenkasiduring pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
oritavancin.    
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of oritavancin in milk 
(for details see section 5.3). It is unknown whether oritavancin/metabolites are excreted in human 
milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Tenkasi 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility due to oritavancin at the highest 
concentrations administered. However, there are no data on the effects of oritavancin on human 
fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tenkasi has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur and this 
may have an effect on driving and use of machines (see section 4.8).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) were: nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, 
infusion site reactions, and headache. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was 
cellulitis (1.1%).  The most common reported reasons for discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%) and 
osteomyelitis (0.3%). Female patients had a higher reporting rate for adverse reactions than male 
patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the clinical programme of 3017 oritavancin-treated subjects, there was no incidence of accidental 
overdose of oritavancin.  
Oritavancin is not removed from blood by haemodialysis procedures. In the event of overdose, 
supportive measures should be taken.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials, 
ATC code: J01XA05 
Mechanism of action 
Oritavancin has three mechanisms of action: (i) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerisation) 
step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors; (ii) inhibition 
of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the peptide bridging 
segments of the cell wall; and (iii) disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, leading to 
depolarisation, permeabilisation, and rapid cell death.   
Resistance 
Gram-negative organisms are intrinsically resistant to all glycopeptides, including oritavancin. 
Resistance to oritavancin was observed in vitro in vancomycin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus 
aureus. There is no known cross-resistance between oritavancin and non-glycopeptide classes of 
antibiotics. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oritavancin exhibits reduced in vitro activity against certain Gram-positive organisms of the genera 
Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus that are intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides.  
Susceptibility testing break points 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:

The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio 
of oritavancin for the infecting organism has been shown to be the parameter that best correlates with 
efficacy. 
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were 
susceptible to oritavancin in vitro.

•   Peptostreptococcus spp. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tenkasi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and 
skin structure infections (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties

Distribution 
Oritavancin is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins. Based on population PK analysis, 
the population mean total volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 87.6 L, indicating 
oritavancin is extensively distributed into the tissues.   
Exposures (AUC0-24) of oritavancin in skin blister fluid were 20% of those in plasma after a single 
800 mg dose in healthy subjects. 
Biotransformation 
No metabolites were observed in plasma or bile from oritavancin treated dogs and rats, respectively. 
Additionally, in vitro human liver microsome studies indicated that oritavancin is not metabolised.  
Elimination 
No mass balance study has been conducted in humans. In humans, less than 1% to 5% of the dose was 
recovered as parent active substance in faeces and urine respectively after 2 weeks of collection 
indicating that oritavancin is slowly excreted unchanged.  
The mean terminal elimination plasma half-life of oritavancin is 245 hours (14.9% CV) based on 
population PK analysis of ABSSSI patients receiving a single 1 200 mg dose. The population mean 
total clearance is estimated at 0.445 L/h (27.2 % CV). 
In a population PK analysis, a relationship between height and clearance was identified, where 
clearance increased with increasing height. Dose modification based on height is not necessary. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin were examined in the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in 
patients with normal renal function, CrCL ≥90 mL/min (n=213), mild renal impairment, 
CrCL 60-89 mL/min (n=59), moderate renal impairment, CrCL 30-59 mL/min (n=22), and severe 
renal impairment CrCL <30 mL/min (n=3). Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that renal 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dedicated studies in 
dialysis patients have been conducted. 
Dose adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, 
wheras data on severe renal impairment are too limited to make dose adjustment recommendation. 
The excipient hydroxypropylbetadex is excreted in urine. Clearance of hydroxypropylbetadex may be 
reduced in patients with renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin were evaluated in a study of subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, n=20) and compared with healthy subjects (n=20) matched for 
gender, age and weight. There were no relevant changes in pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Dose adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. 
Effects of age, weight, gender and race   
Population PK analysis from the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in patients indicated that gender, 
age, weight, or race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dose 
adjustment is warranted in these subpopulations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The primary adverse effect of oritavancin administration to rats and dogs was a dose related 
accumulation of eosinophilic granules in tissue macrophages including hepatocytes, renal cortical 
epithelial cells, adrenal cells and macrophages of the reticulo endothelial system. The appearance of 
the eosinophilic granules did not occur following single dose administration and did not significantly 
affect innate macrophage function in vitro at intracellular levels anticipated from a single 1 200 mg 
dose. 
Moderate, dose-related increases in liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) 
were observed in rats and dogs and were shown to be reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
Biochemistry changes associated with kidney function including decreases in urine-specific gravity 
and pH and slight increases in blood urea nitrogen and sporadic increases in creatinine were present in 
both rat and dog after treatment of two weeks. Reversible minimal tubular vacuolar degeneration was 
also observed in the kidneys of rats, due to a well known effect of hydroxypropylbetadex in the 
formulation. Extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen was observed in rats. This histopathological 
finding correlated with an enlargement and an increase in the weight of the spleen. The exposure in 
rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was less to only slightly higher than the human 
exposure based on the AUC.  
Histamine-like infusion reactions following immediately or shortly after dosing with oritavancin 
occurred in both rats and dogs. These reactions were associated with mortality at lower doses in male 
than in female rats in single dose studies; however, the same gender-related differences were not 
observed in other species. Studies in neonatal rats and dogs for 30 days showed the same tissue effects 
as those seen in adult animals including sensitivity to the oritavancin-mediated histamine-like infusion 
reactions. Mortality was observed in neonatal rats at slightly lower dosage levels than in adults. 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests on the genotoxic potential did not reveal any clinically 
relevant findings. Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of oritavancin.  
When administered intravenously at doses up to 30 mg/kg, oritavancin did not affect the fertility or 
reproductive performance of male and female rats. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or postnatal development. There was no evidence of transplacental transfer of oritavancin in pregnant 
rats. The exposure in rats at the NOAEL was less to only slightly higher than the human exposure 
based on the AUC. 
Following a single intravenous infusion in lactating rats, radio-labelled [14C]oritavancin was excreted in 
milk and absorbed by nursing pups.

For single use only. Tenkasi should be prepared under aseptic techniques.  
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg) that: 
• 
• 
• 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin. 
Have different recommended duration of infusion. 
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and 
compatible diluents. 
Carefully follow the recommended instructions for each medicinal product. 
Tenkasi 1 200 mg vial needs to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single once-only 1 200 mg IV 
dose. The powder must be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and the resulting concentrate 
must be diluted in a glucose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion bag prior to use. Both 
the reconstituted solution and the diluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to pink 
solution. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter after 
reconstitution.  
Reconstitution:   
• 
40 mL of sterile water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to 
reconstitute thevial to provide a 30 mg/mL solution per vial.  
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that sterile WFI should be added carefully, 
along the walls of the vials. 
The vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is 
completely reconstituted in solution.  
• 
• 
Dilution: Glucose 5% (D5W) or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) intravenous bag should be used for 
dilution. 
Dilution: 
•  Withdraw and and discard 40 mL from a 250 mL D5W or 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous 
bag.   
•  Withdraw 40 mL from the reconstituted vial and add to D5W or 0.9% sodium chloride 
intravenous bag to bring the bag volume to 250 mL. This yields a concentration of 4.8mg/mL of 
oritavancin. PP (Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for 
administration preparation.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Package leaflet: Information for the patient 
Tenkasi 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  
oritavancin 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Tenkasi is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tenkasi 
3.  How you will be given Tenkasi 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Tenkasi 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tenkasi is and what it is used for 
Tenkasi is an antibiotic that contains the active substance oritavancin. Oritavancin is a type of 
antibiotic (a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic) that can kill or stop the growth of certain bacteria. 
Tenkasi is used to treat infections of the skin and underlying tissues.  
It is for use in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 months and older.  
Tenkasi can only be used to treat infections caused by bacteria known as Gram-positive bacteria. In 
mixed infections where other types of bacteria are suspected, your doctor will give you other 
appropriate antibiotics together with Tenkasi.    
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tenkasi 
- 
• 
• 
• 
You must not be given Tenkasi 
- 
if you are allergic to oritavancin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if it is expected that you may need to be given a blood thinning medicine (unfractionated heparin 
sodium)  within 5 days (120 hours) of the dose of Tenkasi. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Tenkasi if you: 
• 
have ever had an allergic reaction to another glycopeptide antibiotic (such as vancomycin and 
telavancin)  
have developed severe diarrhoea during or following antibiotic treatment in the past 
have or are suspected to have a bone infection caused by bacteria (osteomyelitis). Your doctor 
will treat you as necessary 
have or are suspected to have a painful collection of pus on your skin (abscess). Your doctor 
will treat you as necessary 
Intravenous infusions of Tenkasi can cause flushing of the upper body, hives, itching and/or rashes. 
Infusion-associated reactions characterized by chest pain, chest discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, 
neck pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever and headache, fatigue, somnolence that might be 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms of hypoxia, have also been observed. If you experience these types of reactions, your doctor 
may decide to stop or slow the infusion. 
Tenkasi may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting and may 
cause a false reading.  
While antibiotics, including Tenkasi, fight certain bacteria, they may not be active against other 
bacteria or fungi, which may, therefore, continue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will 
monitor you in case this happens and treat you if necessary. 
After being given Tenkasi, you may get a new infection at another site on your skin. Your doctor 
should monitor you in case this happens and treat you as necessary. 
Children and adolescents 
Tenkasi should not be used in children below the age of 3 months. The use of Tenkasi has not yet been 
studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Tenkasi 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
If you are going to be given a blood thinner called unfractionated heparin, then tell your doctor if you 
have received Tenkasi within the last 5 days (120 hours).  
It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent blood from 
clotting (oral anticoagulants, e.g.coumarin anticoagulants ). Tenkasi may interfere with laboratory tests 
or self-test that measure how well your blood is clotting (INR) and may cause a false reading up to 12 
hours after the infusion. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

How you will be given Tenkasi 
Tenkasi is available as Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg. The two products differ in oritavancin 
quantity per vial, duration of infusion and preparation instructions for the administration. 
Your doctor or nurse will carefully  give you Tenkasi 400 mg by infusion (drip) into a vein.  
In adults, the recommended dose for Tenkasi is one single infusion of 1 200 mg (equivalent to 3 vials 
of 400 mg) administered into a vein over 3 hours. 
For paediatric patients aged 3 months and over the recommended dose for Tenkasi will be calculated 
based on the weight and age: one single infusion of 15 mg for each kg of body weight administered 
into a vein over 3 hours (maximum 1 200 mg). Please refer to section 6 for further details. 
If you are given more Tenkasi than you should 
Your doctor will decide how to treat you, including stopping the treatment and monitoring for signs of 
ill effects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Tenkasi is intended for intravenous (IV) administration, only after reconstitution and dilution. 
Tenkasi should be prepared under aseptic techniques.  
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg) that: 
• 
• 
• 
compatible diluents.Carefully follow the recommended instructions for each medicinal product. 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin. 
Have different recommended duration of infusion. 
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and 
Three Tenkasi 400 mg vials need to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single once-only 
1 200 mg IV dose. The powder must be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and the resulting 
concentrate must be diluted in a glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag prior to use. Both the 
reconstituted solution and the diluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to pale yellow 
solution. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter after 
reconstitution. Aseptic procedures should be used for the preparation of Tenkasi.  
Adults 
Three Tenkasi 400 mg vials need to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single once-only 1 200 
mg IV dose. 
Reconstitution: Aseptic technique should be used to reconstitute three Tenkasi 400 mg vials. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
40 mL of sterile water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to 
reconstitute each vial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that sterile WFI should be added carefully, 
along the walls of the vials. 
Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all Tenkasi powder is 
completely reconstituted in solution.  
The reconstituted solution should be further diluted in glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag 
immediately. 
Dilution: Three reconstituted vials are needed for dilution for administration of a single 1 200 mg IV 
infusion. Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution.  
To dilute: 
•  Withdraw and discard 120 mL from a 1 000 mL D5W intravenous bag.   
•  Withdraw 40 mL from each of the three reconstituted vials and add to D5W intravenous bag to 
bring the bag volume to 1 000 mL. This yields a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL of oritavancin. PP 
(Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for administration 
preparation. 
Use in the paediatric population (aged 3 months to < 18 years)  
Calculate the dose of oritavancin required based on patient’s weight (one single infusion of 15 mg/kg 
administered intravenously over 3 hours). 
Determine the number of oritavancin vials that are required for the patient (each vial is 400 mg).  
Reconstitution:   
• 
40 mL of water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to reconstitute each 
vial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that WFI should be added carefully, along the 
walls of the vials. 
Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is 
completely reconstituted in solution.  
• 
• 
Dilution: Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution. Sodium chloride 
solution should not be used for dilution. 
To dilute: 
Withdraw the necessary volume of oritavancin with a sterile syringe and add to the IV bag containing 
sterile D5W (please refer to table 1 for relevant example). The size of the IV bag will be based on the 
total volume administered. For small volumes a syringe pump may be used.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tenkasi is and what it is used for 
Tenkasi is an antibiotic that contains the active substance oritavancin. Oritavancin is a type of 
antibiotic (a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic) that can kill or stop the growth of certain bacteria. 
Tenkasi is used to treat infections of the skin and underlying tissues.  
It is for use in adults only. 
Tenkasi can only be used to treat infections caused by bacteria known as Gram-positive bacteria. In 
mixed infections where other types of bacteria are suspected, your doctor will give you other 
appropriate antibiotics together with Tenkasi.    
2.  What you need to know before you are given Tenkasi 
- 
• 
• 
• 
You must not be given Tenkasi 
- 
if you are allergic to oritavancin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if it is expected that you may need to be given a blood thinning medicine (unfractionated heparin 
sodium)  within 5 days (120 hours) of the dose of Tenkasi. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Tenkasi if you: 
• 
have ever had an allergic reaction to another glycopeptide antibiotic (such as vancomycin and 
telavancin)  
have developed severe diarrhoea during or following antibiotic treatment in the past  
have or are suspected to have a bone infection caused by bacteria (osteomyelitis). Your doctor 
will treat you as necessary 
have or are suspected to have a painful collection of pus on your skin (abscess). Your doctor 
will treat you as necessary 
Intravenous infusions of Tenkasi can cause flushing of the upper body, hives, itching and/or rashes. 
Infusion-associated reactions characterized by chest pain, chest discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, 
neck pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever and headache, fatigue, somnolence that might be 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms of hypoxia, have also been observed. If you experience these types of reactions, your doctor 
may decide to stop or slow the infusion. 
Tenkasi may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting and may 
cause a false reading.  
While antibiotics, including Tenkasi, fight certain bacteria, they may not be active against other 
bacteria or fungi, which may, therefore, continue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will 
monitor you in case this happens and treat you if necessary. 
After being given Tenkasi, you may get a new infection at another site on your skin. Your doctor 
should monitor you in case this happens and treat you as necessary. 
Children and adolescents 
Tenkasi should not be used in children or adolescents below the age of 18. 
Other medicines and Tenkasi 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
If you are going to be given a blood thinner called unfractionated heparin, then tell your doctor if you 
have received Tenkasi within the last 5 days (120 hours).  
It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent blood from 
clotting (oral anticoagulants, e.g.coumarin anticoagulants ). Tenkasi may interfere with laboratory tests 
or self-test that measure how well your blood is clotting (INR) and may cause a false reading up to 12 
hours after the infusion. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
You should not be given this medicine during pregnancy unless the benefit is considered to be greater 
than the risk to the baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Tenkasi make you feel dizzy, which can influence your ability to drive or operate machines. 
Tenkasi contains cyclodextrin 
Tenkasi 1 200 mg contains 2 400 mg of hydroxypropylbetadex in each vial which is equivalent to 9.6 
mg/ml.  
3. 
How you will be given Tenkasi 
Tenkasi is available as Tenkasi 1 200 mg and Tenkasi 400 mg. The two products differ in oritavancin 
quantity per vial, duration of infusion and preparation instructions for the administration. 
Your doctor or nurse will carefully give you Tenkasi 1 200 mg by infusion (drip) into a vein. 
The recommended dose for Tenkasi is one single infusion of 1 200 mg administered into a vein over 
1 hour. 
If you are given more Tenkasi than you should 
Your doctor will decide how to treat you, including stopping the treatment and monitoring for signs of 
ill effects.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Tenkasi is intended for intravenous (IV) administration, only after reconstitution and dilution. 
Tenkasi should be prepared under aseptic techniques. 
Are supplied in different dose strengths of oritavancin.
Have different recommended duration of infusion.
Have different preparation instructions, including differences in reconstitution, dilution, and
There are two oritavancin medicinal products (Tenkasi 400 mg and Tenkasi 1 200 mg) that:

compatible diluents.
Carefully follow the recommended instructions for each medicinal product.
Tenkasi 1 200 mg vial needs to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single once-only 1 200 mg IV 
dose. The powder must be reconstituted with sterile water for injection and the resulting concentrate 
must be diluted in a glucose 5% or sodium chloride  9 mg/mL (0.9%) intravenous infusion bag prior to 
use. Both the reconstituted solution and the diluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to 
pink solution. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter after 
reconstitution. 
Aseptic procedures should be used for the preparation of Tenkasi.  
Reconstitution:  
•
40 mL of sterile water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to
reconstitute the vial to provide a 30 mg/mL solution per vial.
To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that sterile WFI should be added carefully,
along the walls of the vials.
The vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is
completely reconstituted in solution.

Dilution: Glucose 5% (D5W) or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) intravenous bag should be used for 
dilution.  
To dilute: 
•  Withdraw and discard 40 mL from a 250 mL D5W or 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous bag.  
•  Withdraw 40 mL of the reconstituted vial and add to D5W or 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous 
bag to bring the bag volume to 250 mL. This yields a concentration of 4.8 mg/mL of 
oritavancin. PP (Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for 
administration preparation. 
The diluted solution should be used immediately.  
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than 4 hours at 25 °C and 12 hours at 2 °C -8 °C for Tenkasi diluted in glucose 
5% or 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous infusion bag

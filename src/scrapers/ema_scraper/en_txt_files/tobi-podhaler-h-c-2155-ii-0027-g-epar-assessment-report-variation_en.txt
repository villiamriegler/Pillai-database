1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested group of variations 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 5 September 2014 an application for a group of variations. 
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to reflect data from study CTBM100C2401 (in 
fulfilment of MEA 010). Update of the RMP to reflect the study conclusion. 
In addition, update of the product information to reflect the change of address of the MAH. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed changes 
In this variation application the MAH has submitted the clinical study report from study CTBM100C2401, “A 
single arm, open label, multicentre, Phase IV trial to assess long-term safety of tobramycin inhalation 
powder (TIP) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis”. Study CTBM100C2401 was conducted as a post-authorization 
measure (PAM) for TOBI Podhaler (MEA 010) with the aim of addressing the need for long-term data. With 
the submission of this Clinical Study Report this commitment is considered to be fulfilled. 
Based on the availability of this long-term data, the MAH proposes to remove the statement “Long-term 
safety data are not available for TOBI Podhaler” from each of the relevant sections of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC). In addition, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is proposed to be updated to 
reflect that long-term safety data are no longer considered to be missing information. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
The application included an EMA Decision ( P/0177/2014)  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation 
plan (PIP). 
The PIP P/0177/2014 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0177/2014.

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The newly submitted data on safety provided by the MAH are consistent with the known safety profile and 
are considered not to change the overall benefit/risk of TOBI Podhaler. 
The MAH proposal to remove the statement that long-term data are not available for TOBI Podhaler in 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant section of the package leaflet is acceptable. 
With the submission of the Clinical Study Report study CTBM100C2401, MEA 010 is considered to be fulfilled. 
Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study CTBM100C2302, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan, which is completed, and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as 
significant (as mentioned in the assessment report of the initial marketing authorisation).

In addition, update of the product information to reflect the change of address of the MAH. 
 is recommended for approval. 
The requested group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed at the time of initial marketing authorisation application the available 
paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0177/2014 and the results of 
these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the 
Package Leaflet. 
In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, significant studies in the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan P/0177/2014 have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation.

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
TOBI Podhaler contains the active substance tobramycin, which is an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by 
Streptomyces tenebrarius that acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis leading to altered cell 
membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope and eventual cell death. It is indicated 
for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with 
cystic fibrosis aged 6 years or older. 
The EURD for tobramycin is 29 October 1973. The International Birth Date of TOBI Podhaler is 25 Nov 2010 
(Chile) and was first authorized in the EU on 20 July 2011. 
Not applicable 
4.2.  Clinical Safety and Efficacy aspects 
The MAH completed study TBM100C2410: A single arm, open-label, multicenter, Phase IV trial to assess 
long term safety of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. The primary 
objective of the study was to provide long-term safety data of TIP over 6 cycles of treatment. Secondary 
objectives were assessment of the efficacy of TIP over 6 cycles of treatment as measured by the relative 
change in FEV1 % predicted, FVC % predicted and FEF25-75 % predicted from baseline to the end of the 
dosing periods (Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13) of each cycle and at the end of the final off-treatment period 
(Visit 14).  
Study design 
This study was an open label, single arm study in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, aged 6 years and 
older, with FEV1 in the range 25 - 75% predicted, who have chronic pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa 
(confirmed within the last 6 months and at screening). The study consisted of a 14 - 28 days screening 
period to test/re-confirm the presence of P. aeruginosa, a baseline visit, followed by the treatment phase of 
6 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 28 days on-treatment period followed by 28 days off-treatment period. 
Total duration of treatment was up to 48 weeks with a total of 14 visits: 9 site visits and 5 telephone calls. 
Patients had a site visit at the end of each on-treatment period and the end of the final off-treatment period.  
The study was planned to recruit approximately 150 patients, with the aim of at least 50% of them are 18 
years or older. 
4.2.1.  Results 
Sample size was 157 patient of which 96 patients (61.1%) completed the study (6 cycles of TIP treatment). 
The demographic characteristics of the population showed the majority of patients included in the study 
were male (61.8%) and ≥ 20 years of age (mean age of 28 years). 
The mean FEV1 % predicted at baseline was 50.2%. Patients on average had a sputum density of 7.6 log10 
CFUs of P. aeruginosa at baseline (sum of all biotypes) and 26.1% had baseline MIC values > 8 μg/ml. A total 
of 58% of patients were on chronic macrolide therapy. Overall the study population was experienced to 
inhaled TOBI or TIP use with 72% having previous experience with TOBI and 5.7% having previous 
experience with TIP.

Efficacy results 
On average, FEV1 % predicted remained stable during the course of the study with a non-significant 1.9% 
relative decrease from baseline after 6 cycles of TIP treatment. The mean relative change from baseline 
showed a decrease of 3.1% for FVC % predicted and an increase of 4.3% for FEF25-75 % predicted after 6 
cycles of TIP treatment. 
After 6 cycles of TIP treatment, a 1.4 log reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) was observed for mucoid 
biotype of P. aeruginosa and a 1.2 log reduction for the sum of all biotypes (p<0.001). At the end of study 
visit, the recovery of CFUs returned to baseline, as expected for the end of an offtreatment phase. 
At study end (off-treatment), 18% of patients had no change in tobramycin MIC (minimum inhibitory 
concentration) from baseline, 43% experienced at least a 2-fold increase in tobramycin MIC, and 27% had 
at least a 4-fold increase. For patients with a baseline MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml, 16.9% had an increase to a MIC > 8 
μg/ml. 
Overall, 103 patients (65.6%) were treated with a new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic during the study (43.3% 
oral use, 45.9% IV use and 5.7% inhaled use). Patients with baseline tobramycin MIC > 8 μg/ml reported 
higher use of new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic as compared to those with baseline tobramycin MIC ≤8 μg/ml 
(31/41 patients, 75.6% vs. 72/115 patients 62.6%). 
Patients with chronic macrolide use reported higher use of new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic overall as 
compared to those without chronic macrolide. Similarly patients with prior inhaled TOBI use reported higher 
use of new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic overall as compared to those without prior inhaled TOBI use 
Safety results 
As the primary study endpoint, 85.4% of patients experienced one or more AEs regardless of relationship to 
study drug. There were no deaths in this study. 
SAEs were experienced by 31.2% of patients and the most common events were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF (24.8%) and hemoptysis (3.2%). Most frequent AEs were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (55.4%), cough (23.6%) and hemoptysis (22.9%). A total of 29 patients 
(18.5%) discontinued the study due to AEs. Four patients (2.5%) discontinued study drug due to SAEs. 
Thirty patients (19.1%) discontinued the study drug due to an AE, regardless of study drug relationship. The 
most common AEs leading to discontinuation were cough and infective pulmonary exacerbations of cystic 
fibrosis (9 patients or 5.7% each), chest discomfort and hemoptysis (4 patients (2.5%) each), dyspnea and 
wheezing (3 patients (1.9%) each) and bronchospasm (2 patients, 1.3%). 
There was no signal of clinically significant bronchospasm (airway reactivity) observed based on 
relative change of FEV1 % predicted from baseline to each post-baseline site visit. 
Post-inhalation events were reported by 37.8% of patients on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and subsequently 
decreased over time to between 21% and 22% during Cycles 4, 5, and 6. Most post inhalation events were 
cough and generally of short duration with a mean time ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 minutes. The incidence of 
post inhalation events ongoing at completion of visit was low (range: 0% in Cycle 1 and Cycle 6 to 2.5% in 
Cycle 2). Overall, cough was the most reported event at all time points.

4.2.2.  Discussion 
The completed single arm, open-label, multicenter, Phase IV trial to assess long term safety of tobramycin 
inhalation powder (TIP) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis shows that TIP was reasonably well tolerated. The 
reported AEs and the AE frequencies are consistent with the known safety profile.  
A high number of patients were treated with a new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic during the study. Resistance 
development is an important potential risk for TIP, in line with the RMP. No hard conclusions can be made 
from the observed change in tobramycine MIC values as FEV1 % predicted remained stable and the 
observed sustained suppressive effect of Tobi Podhaler on P. aeruginosa. 
Overall, the provided data do not indicate that efficacy of TOBI Podhaler decreases with long-term use 
however there is a suggestion of a slight decrease of efficacy after the 4th cycle. Yet the data is not 
sufficiently robust to conclude this. 
The detailed assessment of the results of the study TBM100C2410 is available in a separate assessment 
report (EMA/H/C/002155/0000) 
The MAH proposes to remove the statement that long-term data are not available for TOBI Podhaler in 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC based on the availability of long-term data from study TBM100C2410. 
This is accepted. 
4.3.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 6.0, dated 12 Aug 2014 with this application. 
The RMP has been updated to reflect the results of the completed study TBM100C2410 and to reflect that 
long-term data are no longer considered to be missing data. In addition, many minor textual amendments 
have been made. 
 The content of the updated RMP proposed by the MAH contains the following elements (new wording 
underlined, deleted wording in strikethrough): 
Safety concerns

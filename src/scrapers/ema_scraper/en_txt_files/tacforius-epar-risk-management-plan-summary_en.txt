Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Tacforius (tacrolimus) 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 
3 mg and 5 mg prolonged-release hard capsules 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Tacforius (tacrolimus) 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 
3 mg and 5 mg prolonged-release hard capsules (hereinafter referred to as Tacrolimus). The 
RMP details important risks of Tacrolimus, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about Tacrolimus's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Tacrolimus's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Tacrolimus should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Tacrolimus should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Tacrolimus's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
Tacforius (tacrolimus) 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg prolonged-release hard capsules are 
authorised for: 
•  Prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients; 
•  Treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive 
medicinal products in adult patients (see SmPC for the full indication).  
They contain Tacrolimus as the active substance and they are taken orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Tacrolimus’s benefits can be found in Tacrolimus’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tacforius. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Tacrolimus, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Tacrolimus's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Tacrolimus are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Tacrolimus. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

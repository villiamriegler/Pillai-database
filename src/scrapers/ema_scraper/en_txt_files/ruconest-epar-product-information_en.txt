PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Powder for solution for injection. 
White to off-white powder. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ruconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents, and children (aged 
2 years and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Ruconest should be initiated under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of hereditary angioedema. 
Posology in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above 
Body weight up to 84 kg 
-  One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight. 
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  One intravenous injection of 4200 U (2 vials). 
In the majority of cases, a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  
In case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be 
administered at the discretion of the physician (see section 5.1). 
- 
- 
In adults and adolescents an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded 
adequately after 120 minutes.  
In children an additional dose may be administered if the patient has not responded adequately after 60 
minutes. 
Not more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours.

Dose calculation 
Determine the patient’s body weight. 
Body weight up to 84 kg 
-  For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: 
Volume to be 
administered (ml)  
= 
body weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) 
150 (U/ml) 
= 
body weight (kg) 
3 
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U 
(2 vials). 
Paediatric population  
Ruconest may be used in paediatric patients (2 years and older) at the same dose as in adults (50 U/kg body 
weight).  
The safety and efficacy of Ruconest in children less than 2 years old have not been established. No clinical 
data are available.  
Elderly (≥65 years old)  
Data in patients older than 65 years are limited.  
There is no rationale for patients older than 65 years to respond differently to Ruconest.  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment since conestat alfa does not undergo renal 
clearance. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is no clinical experience with Ruconest in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment may 
prolong the plasma half-life of conestat alfa, but this is not thought to be a clinical concern. No 
recommendation on a dose adjustment can be made. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Ruconest should be administered by a healthcare professional. 
For instructions on reconstitution of Ruconest before administration, see section 6.6. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection 
over approximately 5 minutes. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Known or suspected allergy to rabbits (see section 4.4)  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered products should be clearly recorded. 
Conestat alfa is derived from milk of transgenic rabbits and contains traces of rabbit protein. Before initiating 
treatment with Ruconest, patients should be queried about prior exposure to rabbits and signs and symptoms 
suggestive of an allergic reaction. 
Hypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded and may have symptoms similar to angioedema attacks. 
All patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms of hypersensitivity during 
and after the administration period. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions e.g., hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. If 
these symptoms occur after administration, they should alert their physician. 
In case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, emergency medical treatment should be administered. 
Although cross-reactivity between cow milk and rabbit milk is considered unlikely, the possibility of such a 
cross-reactivity in a patient who has evidence of clinical allergy to cow milk cannot be excluded and the 
patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity following Ruconest administration. 
Thromboembolic events 
Serious arterial and venous thromboembolic (TE) events have been reported at the recommended dose of 
plasma derived C1 esterase inhibitor products in patients with known risk factors (e.g., indwelling catheters, 
prior history of thrombosis, underlying atherosclerosis, use of oral contraceptives or certain androgens, 
morbid obesity, immobility). Patients with known risk factors should be monitored closely. 
Sodium 
Each vial of Ruconest contains 19.5 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled 
sodium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Scientific literature indicates an interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and C1-INH 
containing medicinal products. Ruconest should not be administered simultaneously with tPA. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is no experience with the use of Ruconest in pregnant and breast-feeding women. 
In one animal study reproductive toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). Ruconest is not recommended for 
use during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless the treating physician judges the benefits to outweigh the 
possible risks.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of Ruconest on male or female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on the known pharmacology and adverse reaction profile of Ruconest, effects on the ability to drive 
and use machines are not expected. However, headache, vertigo and dizziness have been reported following 
the use of Ruconest, but may also occur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to 
drive and use machines if they experience headache, vertigo or dizziness. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
One case of hypersensitivity was observed in clinical trials with Ruconest. The most common adverse 
reaction observed after administration of Ruconest is nausea. 
Tabulated lists of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported with Ruconest in the treatment of acute HAE attacks obtained from clinical trials 
and post-marketing surveillance are tabulated below. In clinical trials, the incidence of adverse reactions was

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC code: 
B06AC04. 
The plasma protein C1-INH is the main regulator of activation of the contact and complement systems in 
vivo. HAE patients have a heterozygous deficiency of the plasma protein C1-INH. As a result they may 
suffer from uncontrolled activation of contact and complement systems, with formation of inflammatory 
mediators, which clinically becomes manifest as the occurrence of acute angioedema attacks. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conestat alfa, a recombinant human complement component 1 (C1) esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH), is an 
analogue of human C1-INH and is obtained from the milk of rabbits expressing the gene coding for human 
C1-INH. The amino acid sequence of conestat alfa is identical to that of endogenous C1-INH. 
C1-INH exerts an inhibitory effect on several proteases (target proteases) of the contact and complement 
systems. The effect of conestat alfa on the following target proteases was assessed in vitro: activated C1s, 
kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. Inhibition kinetics were found to be comparable with those observed 
for plasma-derived human C1-INH. 
The complement component (protein) C4, is a substrate for activated C1s. Patients with HAE have low 
levels of C4 in the circulation. As for plasma-derived C1-INH, the pharmacodynamic effects of conestat alfa 
on C4 show dose-dependent restoration of complement homeostasis in HAE patients at a plasma C1-INH 
activity level greater than 0.7 U/ml, which is the lower limit of the normal range. In HAE patients, Ruconest 
at a dose of 50 U/kg increases plasma C1-INH activity level to greater than 0.7 U/ml for approximately 
2 hours (see section 5.2). 
The efficacy and safety of Ruconest as a treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult and adolescent 
patients with HAE has been evaluated in two double blind randomized placebo controlled and four open 
label clinical studies. The doses evaluated in the clinical studies ranged from a single vial of 2100 U 
(corresponding to 18-40 U/kg), to 50 and 100 U/kg. Efficacy of Ruconest as a treatment for acute 
angioedema attacks was demonstrated by significantly shorter time to beginning of relief of symptoms and 
time to minimal symptoms and few therapeutic failures. The table below shows the results (primary and 
secondary endpoints) of the two randomized controlled trials:

The results of the open label studies were consistent with the above findings and support the repeated use of 
Ruconest in the treatment of subsequent attacks of angioedema. 
In the randomized controlled trials 39/41 (95%) of patients treated with Ruconest reached time to beginning 
of relief within 4 hours. In an open label study 146/151 (97%) attacks treated with a single dose of 50 U/kg 
reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was administered for 
17/168 (10%) attacks. 
Paediatric population 
Children 
In an open label study with 20 children with HAE (aged 5 to 14 years), 64/67 (96%) attacks treated with a 
single dose of 50 U/kg reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was 
administered for 3/73 (4%) attacks. 
Adolescents 
Ten adolescent HAE patients (aged 13 to 17 years) were treated with 50 U/kg for 27 acute angioedema 
attacks, and 7 (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks.  
The efficacy and safety results in children and adolescents were consistent with those in adults.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
No formal distribution studies have been performed. The distribution volume of conestat alfa was 
approximately 3 L, comparable to plasma volume.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
Based on animal data, conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated 
endocytosis followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation. 
After administration of Ruconest (50 U/kg) to asymptomatic HAE patients, a Cmax of 1.36 U/ml was 
observed. The elimination half-life of conestat alfa was approximately 2 hours. 
Excretion 
There is no excretion, as conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis 
followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation in the liver. 
Paediatric population 
Children 
After receiving a conestat alfa dose of 50 U/kg, a total of 18/20 children had concentrations of functional C1-
INH that were >70% of normal (the lower limit of the normal range) at the 5-minute and/or 2-4 hour post-
dose time points. The arithmetic mean functional C1-INH Cmax for the first attack was 123% of normal 
(range 62% to 168%) and the AUC0-3 was 171% of normal (range 95% to 244%). 
A population PK model shows that a dose of 50 U/kg will achieve concentrations of functional C1-INH that 
are >70% of normal in 96.0% of children aged 2 to ≤13 years and in 90.5% of children aged 2 to <5 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data do not indicate any safety concern for the use of conestat alfa in humans based on studies of 
safety pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, two-week sub-chronic toxicity and local tolerance in various 
animal species including rats, dogs, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential 
is not expected. 
Embryofoetal studies in rat and rabbit; Daily single doses of vehicle or 625 U/kg/administration of conestat 
alfa were administered intravenously to mated rats and rabbits. In the study in rats there were no malformed 
foetuses in either the conestat alfa or the control group. In a rabbit embryotoxicity study an increase in the 
incidence of foetal cardiac vessel defects (1.12% in the treatment group versus 0.03% in historical controls) 
was observed for animals that were administered conestat alfa.

Data in patients older than 65 years are limited.  
There is no rationale for patients older than 65 years to respond differently to Ruconest.  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment since conestat alfa does not undergo renal 
clearance. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is no clinical experience with Ruconest in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment may 
prolong the plasma half-life of conestat alfa, but this is not thought to be a clinical concern. No 
recommendation on a dose adjustment can be made. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Ruconest must be administered by a healthcare professional until the patient (or caregiver) is competent to 
administer after having been properly trained and in agreement with the healthcare professional. 
For instructions on reconstitution of Ruconest before administration, see section 6.6. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection 
over approximately 5 minutes.

Sodium 
Each vial of Ruconest contains 19.5 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled 
sodium diet. 
Home-treatment and self-administration 
There are limited data on the use of this medicinal product in home- or self-administration. Potential risks 
associated with home-treatment are related to the administration itself as well as the handling of adverse 
reactions, particularly hypersensitivity. The decision on the use of home-treatment for an individual patient 
should be made by the treating physician, who should ensure that appropriate training is provided and the use 
reviewed at intervals. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Scientific literature indicates an interaction of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and C1-INH 
containing medicinal products. Ruconest should not be administered simultaneously with tPA. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is no experience with the use of Ruconest in pregnant and breast-feeding women. 
In one animal study reproductive toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). Ruconest is not recommended for 
use during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless the treating physician judges the benefits to outweigh the 
possible risks.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of Ruconest on male or female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Based on the known pharmacology and adverse reaction profile of Ruconest, effects on the ability to drive 
and use machines are not expected. However headache, vertigo and dizziness have been reported following 
the use of Ruconest, but may also occur as a result of an attack of HAE. Patients should be advised not to 
drive and use machines if they experience headache, vertigo or dizziness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC code: 
B06AC04. 
The plasma protein C1-INH is the main regulator of activation of the contact and complement systems in 
vivo. HAE patients have a heterozygous deficiency of the plasma protein C1-INH. As a result they may 
suffer from uncontrolled activation of contact and complement systems, with formation of inflammatory 
mediators, which clinically becomes manifest as the occurrence of acute angioedema attacks. 
Conestat alfa, a recombinant human complement component 1 (C1) esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH), is an 
analogue of human C1-INH and is obtained from the milk of rabbits expressing the gene coding for human 
C1-INH. The amino acid sequence of conestat alfa is identical to that of endogenous C1-INH. 
C1-INH exerts an inhibitory effect on several proteases (target proteases) of the contact and complement 
systems. The effect of conestat alfa on the following target proteases was assessed in vitro: activated C1s, 
kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. Inhibition kinetics were found to be comparable with those observed 
for plasma-derived human C1-INH. 
The complement component (protein) C4, is a substrate for activated C1s. Patients with HAE have low 
levels of C4 in the circulation. As for plasma-derived C1-INH, the pharmacodynamic effects of conestat alfa 
on C4 show dose-dependent restoration of complement homeostasis in HAE patients at a plasma C1-INH 
activity level greater than 0.7 U/ml, which is the lower limit of the normal range. In HAE patients, Ruconest 
at a dose of 50 U/kg increases plasma C1-INH activity level to greater than 0.7 U/ml for approximately 
2 hours (see section 5.2). 
The efficacy and safety of Ruconest as a treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult and adolescent 
patients with HAE has been evaluated in two double blind randomized placebo controlled and four open 
label clinical studies. The doses evaluated in the clinical studies ranged from a single vial of 2100 U 
(corresponding to 18-40 U/kg), to 50 and 100 U/kg. Efficacy of Ruconest as a treatment for acute 
angioedema attacks was demonstrated by significantly shorter time to beginning of relief of symptoms and 
time to minimal symptoms and few therapeutic failures. The table below shows the results (primary and 
secondary endpoints) of the two randomized controlled trials:

The results of the open label studies were consistent with the above findings and support the repeated use of 
Ruconest in the treatment of subsequent attacks of angioedema. 
In the randomized controlled trials 39/41 (95%) of patients treated with Ruconest reached time to beginning 
of relief within 4 hours. In an open label study 146/151 (97%) attacks treated with a single dose of 50 U/kg 
reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was administered for 
17/168 (10%) attacks. 
Paediatric population 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children 
In an open label study with 20 children with HAE (aged 5 to 14 years), 64/67 (96%) attacks treated with a 
single dose of 50 U/kg reached time to beginning of relief within 4 hours. An additional dose of 50 U/kg was 
administered for 3/73 (4%) attacks. 
Adolescents 
Ten adolescent HAE patients (aged 13 to 17 years) were treated with 50 U/kg for 27 acute angioedema 
attacks, and 7 (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks.  
The efficacy and safety results in children and adolescents were consistent with those in adults. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
No formal distribution studies have been performed. The distribution volume of conestat alfa was 
approximately 3 L, comparable to plasma volume.  
Biotransformation and elimination 
Based on animal data, conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated 
endocytosis followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation. 
After administration of Ruconest (50 U/kg) to asymptomatic HAE patients, a Cmax of 1.36 U/ml was 
observed. The elimination half-life of conestat alfa was approximately 2 hours. 
Excretion 
There is no excretion, as conestat alfa is cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis 
followed by complete hydrolysis/degradation in the liver. 
Paediatric population 
Children 
After receiving a conestat alfa dose of 50 U/kg, a total of 18/20 children had concentrations of functional C1-
INH that were >70% of normal (the lower limit of the normal range) at the 5-minute and/or 2-4 hour post-
dose time points. The arithmetic mean functional C1-INH Cmax for the first attack was 123% of normal 
(range 62% to 168%) and the AUC0-3 was 171% of normal (range 95% to 244%). 
A population PK model shows that a dose of 50 U/kg will achieve concentrations of functional C1-INH that 
are >70% of normal in 96.0% of children aged 2 to ≤13 years and in 90.5% of children aged 2 to <5 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data do not indicate any safety concern for the use of conestat alfa in humans based on studies of 
safety pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, two-week sub-chronic toxicity and local tolerance in various 
animal species including rats, dogs, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential 
is not expected. 
Embryofoetal studies in rat and rabbit; Daily single doses of vehicle or 625 U/kg/administration of conestat 
alfa were administered intravenously to mated rats and rabbits. In the study in rats there were no malformed 
foetuses in either the conestat alfa or the control group. In a rabbit embryotoxicity study an increase in the 
incidence of foetal cardiac vessel defects (1.12% in the treatment group versus 0.03% in historical controls) 
was observed for animals that were administered conestat alfa.

Reconstitution 
1. 
2. 
Each vial of Ruconest (2100 U) should be reconstituted with 14 ml of solvent. 
Disinfect the rubber stoppers of the powder and solvent vials and put a vial adapter onto each solvent 
and powder vial until it snaps onto the vial neck. 
Attach the syringe to the adapter on the solvent vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Draw in 14 ml of 
solvent. Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the vial with 
adapter. 
Attach the syringe with solvent to the adapter on the powder vial and turn clockwise until it locks. The 
solvent should be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to minimise 
foaming of the solution. Leave the syringe on the adapter. Repeat steps 3 and 4 if you need to prepare 
a second solution (this requires a second kit). 
The reconstituted solution contains 150 U/ml conestat alfa and appears as a clear colourless solution. 
The reconstituted solution in each vial should be visually inspected for particulate matter and 
discoloration. A solution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. Small amounts of 
foam are acceptable. The medicinal product should be used immediately (see section 6.3). 
Administration 
1. 
Draw in the required volume of prepared solution. Never exceed 14 ml per syringe. Unlock the 
syringe(s) by turning counter clockwise and discard the vial with adapter. 
Attach the infusion set to the syringe and turn clockwise until it locks. Hold the syringe with the tip 
pointing upwards and gently press the plunger to fill the infusion set with the solution. 
Disinfect the injection site with an alcohol pad. Remove the needle cap from the needle of the infusion 
set and carefully insert the needle into the vein. 
Ensure that the tourniquet is released. Gently inject the solution into the vein – inject over about 5 
minutes. 
If two syringes were prepared: fold over the tubing to prevent backflow, unscrew the empty syringe 
from the infusion set (counter clockwise) and immediately replace it with the second syringe. Gently 
inject the solution of the second syringe.  
Disposal 
Please safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty 
vial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly. 
Do not reuse equipment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ruconest is and what it is used for 
Ruconest contains conestat alfa as the active substance. Conestat alfa is a recombinant (not blood-derived) 
form of human C1 inhibitor (rhC1-INH).  
Ruconest is to be used by adults, adolescents, and children (aged 2 years and above) with a rare inherited 
blood disorder, called Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). These patients have a shortage of the C1 inhibitor 
protein in their blood. This can lead to repeated attacks of swelling, pain in the abdomen, difficulty breathing 
and other symptoms. 
The administration of Ruconest is to resolve the shortage of C1 inhibitor and will lead to reduction of 
symptoms of an acute attack of HAE. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ruconest  
Do not use Ruconest 
• 
• 
If you are or think you are allergic to rabbits. 
If you are allergic to conestat alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Ruconest. 
If you experience allergic reactions e.g. hives, rash, itching, dizziness, wheezing, difficulty breathing or your 
tongue swells up following the administration of Ruconest, you should seek emergency medical assistance so 
that symptoms of your allergic reaction can be treated urgently. 
Before you start treatment with Ruconest, it is important that you tell your doctor if you have, or have had, 
problems with your blood clotting (thrombotic events). You will be carefully monitored if this is the case. 
Hypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded and may have symptoms similar to angioedema attacks. 
Children and adolescents 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years old. Ruconest has not been studied in children younger 
than 5 years of age. Your doctor will determine whether treatment of your child with Ruconest is 
appropriate. Additional monitoring of your child for symptoms of allergic reactions during and after 
administration is needed. 
Other medicines and Ruconest 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
If you are receiving tissue type plasminogen activator as acute treatment for blood clots, you should not be

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION 
Posology 
Body weight up to 84 kg 
-  One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight.  
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  One intravenous injection of 4200 U (two vials). 
In the majority of cases a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  
In case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be 
administered. 
Not more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours. 
Dose calculation 
Determine the patient’s body weight. 
Body weight up to 84 kg  
-  For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: 
Volume to be 
administered (ml)  
= 
body weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) 
150 (U/ml) 
= 
body weight (kg) 
3 
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U 
(2 vials). 
Reconstitute each vial with 14 ml water for injections (see section on Reconstitution below). 
The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 2100 U conestat alfa at 150 U/ml. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection 
over approximately 5 minutes. 
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
Each vial of Ruconest is for single use only. 
An aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution, combining and mixing the solutions. 
Reconstitution 
Each vial of Ruconest (2100 U) should be reconstituted with 14 ml water for injections. Water for injections 
should be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to minimise foaming of the 
solution. The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 2100 U conestat alfa at 150 U/ml and appears as a 
clear colourless solution. 
The reconstituted solution in each vial should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. A 
solution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. The medicinal product should be used 
immediately.

3. 
How to use Ruconest 
Ruconest will be initiated by a doctor who is specialised in the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary 
angioedema. 
Ruconest must be administered by a healthcare professional until you or your caregiver are properly trained 
and capable to administer Ruconest. 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor or nurse have told you. Check 
with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure.  
Ruconest is administered into a vein over about 5 minutes. Your dose will be worked out based on your body 
weight.  
Most of the time a single dose is sufficient. An additional dose could be administered if your symptoms do 
not improve after 120 minutes (for adults and adolescents) or 60 minutes (for children). No more than 
2 doses, calculated according to step 7, should be given within 24 hours. 
You or your caregiver may inject Ruconest only after receiving adequate instructions and training from your 
doctor or nurse. 
Instructions for use 
Do not mix or administer Ruconest with other medicines or solutions. The following describes how Ruconest 
solution must be prepared and administered. 
Before you begin 
• 
• 
• 
Ensure the kit package is complete and contains all components listed in section 6 of this leaflet. 
In addition to the kit, the following is required: 
-  a tourniquet 
-  plaster for securing the needle 
Inspect vials and other components. 
-  All vials must be sealed with plastic lid and aluminium cap and without visible damage, such as 
cracks in glass. 
-  Check the expiry date. Never use any kit component after the expiry date stated on the big outer 
carton. 
Within a single kit box, different components may have different expiry dates. The expiry date on 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the outer carton reflects the date of the component with the shortest shelf-life.  
• 
Allow the number of powder and solvent vials required according to step 1, to reach room 
temperature. 
Preparation of solution 
Step 1: Cleaning and other requirements 
•  Wash your hands carefully. 
• 
Put the powder and solvent vials required on a flat and clean surface. 
-  body weight 42 kg or less: 1 powder and 1 solvent vial 
-  body weight over 42 kg: 2 powder and 2 solvent vials 
Put the vial adapters on the work surface. Do not remove the adapter packaging.  
-  2 adapters if 1 powder and 1 solvent vial is required 
-  4 adapters if 2 powder and 2 solvent vials are required 
Put the syringe(s) on the work surface. Do not remove the syringe packaging. 
-  1 syringe if 1 powder and 1 solvent vial is required 
-  2 syringes if 2 powder and 2 solvent vials are required 
• 
• 
Step 2: Disinfection of vial stoppers 
• 
• 
Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder and solvent vials. 
Use one alcohol pad to disinfect all vial stoppers and wait for at least 30 seconds until the stoppers 
have dried. 
• 
After disinfection, do not touch the stoppers with your fingers or anything else. 
Step 3: Mounting of adapters on vials 
• 
Take a packaged adapter in one hand and remove the lid. The adapter must remain in its plastic 
packaging.  
Put the adapter onto a powder vial, piercing the stopper, until it snaps onto the vial neck. 
• 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Leave the packaging on the adapter until you attach the syringe in steps 4 and 5. 
Repeat the above steps for mounting an adapter on the solvent vial. All adapters supplied with the kit 
are identical. 
If you need to use a second powder and solvent vial, repeat the above steps. 
Step 4: Drawing up solvent 
• 
• 
Take a sterile syringe out of its packaging. 
Remove the packaging from the adapter on the solvent vial. 
• 
Hold the adapter with one hand. With the other hand, attach the syringe and secure by turning it 
clockwise until it stops. 
• 
Turn the whole – solvent vial with adapter and syringe – upside down. While keeping it vertical, 
slowly draw in 14 ml solvent. 
If air bubbles appear, minimise as far as possible by gently tapping the syringe and applying gentle 
pressure by pushing the plunger into the syringe. Continue to fill the syringe with 14 ml solvent. 
• 
Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter-clockwise. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Leave the remainder of the solvent in the vial and discard the vial. 
Place the syringe on the work surface, taking care not to touch the surface or any other object with the 
syringe tip. 
Step 5: Adding solvent to powder and dissolving 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the packaging from the adapter on the powder vial. 
Take the syringe with solvent that you prepared in step 4. 
Hold the adapter with the other hand and attach the syringe. Secure the syringe by turning it clockwise 
until it stops.  
Push the solvent slowly, in a single motion, into the powder vial in order to minimise foaming. 
Leave the syringe on the adapter and gently swirl the vial for approximately half a minute. Do not 
shake. 
After swirling, leave the vial on the surface for several minutes until the solution has become clear. If 
undissolved powder is still present, repeat the procedure. 
• 
Repeat steps 4 and 5 if you need to prepare a second solution. 
Step 6: Check prepared solutions 
• 
Check whether the powder in the vial(s) has dissolved completely and the plunger is completely 
pushed down in the syringe. 
After the powder has dissolved, the solution should be clear and colourless. 
Do not use the prepared solution if it is cloudy, contains particles or has changed colour. Inform your 
• 
• 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healthcare professional if this occurs. Small amounts of foam are acceptable. 
Step 7: Drawing up prepared solution 
• 
Calculate the millilitres of prepared solution to be injected. 
Body weight 
below 84 kg 
84 kg and above  
Millilitres of prepared solution to be injected 
Body weight in kg divided by three 
28 ml 
• 
Draw in the volume of prepared solution, while keeping the syringe in the vertical position. If you 
have prepared: 
-  one vial with solution, draw up the volume as calculated 
- 
two vials and your body weight is below 84 kg, draw up in a similar way: 
a)  14 ml from the first vial 
b)  from the second vial, the difference between your calculated volume and the 14 ml from the 
first vial 
two vials and your body weight is 84 kg or more, draw up 14 ml from each vial into each syringe 
- 
If air bubbles appear, minimise as far as possible by gently tapping the syringe and applying gentle 
pressure by pushing the plunger into the syringe. Continue to fill the syringe with the volume required. 
• 
• 
• 
Never exceed the volume of 14 ml per syringe. 
Unlock the syringe(s) by turning it counter-clockwise and discard the vial(s) with adapter. 
Place the syringe(s) on the work surface, taking care not to touch the surface or any other object with 
the syringe tip. 
Step 8: Check prepared syringes 
• 
Recheck that the volume in the syringe(s) you prepared in step 7 is correct. 
Administration into a vein 
It is very important that the prepared solution is injected directly into a vein and not into an artery or the 
surrounding tissue. 
Inject the Ruconest solution immediately after preparation, preferably while seated. 
Step 9: Required components 
• 
Check that all required components are on the work surface: 
-  1 or 2 syringes with prepared solution 
-  1 infusion set with 25G needle 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  1 alcohol pad 
-  1 sterile non-woven pad 
-  1 self-adhesive plaster 
-  1 tourniquet 
-  1 plaster for securing the needle 
Step 10: Preparation of the infusion set 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the screw cap from the end of the infusion set. This is the end which has no needle. 
Hold this end with one hand, attach the syringe tip end and secure by turning clockwise until it stops. 
Hold the syringe with the tip pointing upwards. Gently press the syringe plunger to carefully fill the 
infusion set with the prepared solution. 
• 
Check that no air is present in the syringe, infusion tube or the needle. 
Step 11: Preparing the injection site 
• 
Position the tourniquet above the injection site – preferably the middle part of the upper arm. Tighten 
it to compress the vein. This should be boosted by tightening your fist. 
Feel, with your other hand, for an appropriate vein. 
Disinfect the injection site thoroughly with an alcohol pad and let the skin dry. 
• 
• 
Step 12: Administration of the prepared solution  
• 
• 
Remove the needle cap. 
Carefully insert the needle of the infusion set, at the flattest possible angle, into the vein. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Secure the needle by applying the plaster, around 7 cm long, over the wings of the needle. 
Carefully pull back the syringe plunger slightly until you see blood being drawn into the tubing, to 
ensure that the needle is in the vein.  
Release the tourniquet. 
If there is no blood in the tubing, remove the needle, repeat all steps from beginning of step 11 and 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
reposition the needle. 
If blood is present, gently inject the solution into the vein, as shown in the picture. Inject over about 
5 minutes. 
• 
If you have prepared two syringes: 
- 
-  unscrew the empty syringe from the infusion set and immediately replace it with the second syringe 
fold over the tubing near the connector of the infusion set to prevent backflow 
-  unfold the tubing and gently inject this solution, similar to the first syringe 
Step 13: After administration 
• 
• 
Carefully remove the plaster for securing the needle and withdraw the needle from the vein. 
Immediately after removing the needle, press the sterile pad on the injection site for a few minutes to 
reduce bleeding. 
• 
• 
• 
Next, put the self-adhesive plaster on the injection site. 
Fold down the yellow protection cap over the needle. 
Safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty 
vial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of 
properly. Do not reuse equipment. 
Step 14: Documenting the administration 
Please record (e.g. in your diary): 
• 
• 
date and time of the administration 
the batch number written on the label of the powder vial 
If you use more Ruconest than you should 
Contact your doctor or nearest hospital if this occurs.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION 
Posology 
Body weight up to 84 kg 
-  One intravenous injection of 50 U/kg body weight.  
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  One intravenous injection of 4200 U (two vials). 
In the majority of cases a single dose of Ruconest is sufficient to treat an acute angioedema attack.  
In case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose (50 U/kg body weight up to 4200 U) can be 
administered. 
Not more than two doses should be administered within 24 hours.

Determine the patient’s body weight. 
Body weight up to 84 kg  
-  For patients up to 84 kg calculate the volume required to be administered according to the formula below: 
Volume to be 
administered (ml)  
= 
body weight (kg) times 50 (U/kg) 
150 (U/ml) 
= 
body weight (kg) 
3 
Body weight of 84 kg or greater  
-  For patients of 84 kg or above the volume required to be administered is 28 ml, corresponding to 4200 U 
(2 vials). 
Reconstitute each vial with 14 ml water for injections (see section on Reconstitution below). 
The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 2100 U conestat alfa at 150 U/ml. 
The required volume of the reconstituted solution should be administered as a slow intravenous injection 
over approximately 5 minutes. 
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
Preparation and handling 
Each vial of Ruconest is for single use only. 
Ruconest is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with water for injections. An aseptic 
technique should be used for reconstitution, combining and mixing the solutions.

Reconstitution 
1. 
2. 
Each vial of Ruconest (2100 U) should be reconstituted with 14 ml water for injections. 
Disinfect the rubber stoppers of the powder and solvent vials and put a vial adapter onto each solvent 
and powder vial until it snaps onto the vial neck. 
Attach a syringe to the adapter on a solvent vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Draw in 14 ml of 
solvent. Unlock the syringe from the adapter by turning counter clockwise. Repeat this step if two 
powder vials need to be reconstituted. 
Attach a syringe with solvent to the adapter on a powder vial and turn clockwise until it locks. Water 
for injections should be added slowly to avoid forceful impact on the powder and mixed gently to 
minimise foaming of the solution. Leave the syringe on the adapter. Repeat this step if a second 
powder vial needs to be reconstituted. 
The reconstituted solution in each vial contains 150 U/ml and appears as a clear colourless solution. 
The reconstituted solution in each vial should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. A 
solution exhibiting particulates or discoloration should not be used. Small amounts of foam are 
acceptable. The medicinal product should be used immediately.  
Administration 
1. 
Draw in the required volume of prepared solution. Never exceed 14 ml per syringe. Unlock the 
syringe(s) by turning counter clockwise and discard vial(s) with adapter 
Attach the infusion set to the syringe and turn clockwise until it locks. Hold the syringe with the tip 
pointing upwards and gently press the plunger to fill the infusion set with the solution 
Disinfect the injection site with an alcohol pad. Remove the needle cap from the needle of the infusion 
set and carefully insert the needle into the vein. 
Ensure that the tourniquet is released. Gently inject the solution into the vein – inject over about 5 
minutes. 
If two syringes were prepared: fold over the tubing to prevent backflow, unscrew the empty syringe 
from the infusion set (counter clockwise) and immediately replace it with the second syringe. Gently 
inject the solution of the second syringe.  
Disposal 
Please safely dispose of the used infusion set with needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty 
vial in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for conestat alfa, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and 
in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between conestat alfa 
and  
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Anaphylaxis 
Thromboembolic events 
is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing conestat alfa should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for conestat alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing conestat alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

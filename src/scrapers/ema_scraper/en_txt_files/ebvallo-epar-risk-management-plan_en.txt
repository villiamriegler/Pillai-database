PART II.  SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Page 9 of 112 
Module SI. 
Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s) 
Epstein-Barr virus-positive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) is an ultra-rare 
disease, and a very small number of patients with EBV+ PTLD relapse or are refractory to a previous 
treatment. It is estimated that ~290 European Union (EU) patients annually are impacted by EBV+ PTLD 
that is relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) to rituximab. 
Proposed Indication 
Tabelecleucel is indicated as monotherapy for treatment of adult and paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with relapsed or refractory EBV+ PTLD who have received at least one prior therapy. For solid 
organ transplant patients, prior therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is inappropriate. 
Incidence 
Incidence of EBV+ PTLD following HCT 
The overall annual incidence of PTLD following haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is approximately 
1.1 – 1.7% [Dierickx 2013; Garcia-Cadenas 2019]. Nearly all PTLD cases that develop after HCT 
are EBV+ [Garcia-Cadenas 2019; Socié 2020; Styczynski 2013; Uhlin 2014]. Thus, the overall incidence 
of EBV+ PTLD following HCT is approximately 1.1 – 1.7%. 
In the HCT setting, the majority of PTLD cases occur within 1 year after transplant, with median time to 
diagnosis of about 2-4 months [Dierickx 2018]. Since there is no approved treatment for PTLD, many 
clinicians use rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody indicated to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
as initial treatment for PTLD [Dierickx 2018; Jagadeesh 2019; Rituximab 2020]. However, approximately 
50% of patients with PTLD following HCT fail initial treatment with rituximab [Garcia-Cadenas 2019]. 
Based on the reported number of allogeneic bone marrow transplants in 28 countries of the EU (EU28) 
[EDQM 2020], the overall incidence of EBV+ PTLD following HCT, and the proportion of patients 
failing initial therapy, the estimated total number of EBV+ PTLD patients following HCT 
R/R to rituximab was 90-140 in the EU28 for the year 2019. 
Incidence of EBV+ PTLD following SOT 
In the solid organ transplant (SOT) setting, chronic immunosuppression confers lifelong risk for PTLD, 
which can occur up to 30 years posttransplant [Jagadeesh 2020; Trappe 2017]. The incidence is largely 
dependent on the type of transplanted organ, the type and degree of immunosuppression, and patient 
characteristics [Al-Mansour 2013]. 
To estimate the annual incidence of PTLD following SOT, given the time to PTLD diagnosis and varying 
rates of PTLD over time, the construction of a dynamic model that incorporates all of the following 
variables is required: the number of EU transplants since 2000 (Global Observatory on Donation and 
Transplantation [GODT]), the annual rate of PTLD over time by organ type, and survival rate over time 
for transplant patients [Graham 2020a; Graham 2020b]. Based on the above factors, it is estimated that 
about 750-900 new PTLD cases occurred in the EU28 in 2019. 
About fifty percent of cases of PTLD following SOT are EBV+ [Jagadeesh 2020; Trappe 2017]. Among 
all cases of PTLD following SOT, around a third of patients eventually relapse or become refractory to 
initial treatment with rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy (CT) [Jagadeesh 2020; Trappe 2017]. 
In the EU, the total number of patients with EBV+ PTLD following SOT who fail initial treatment with 
rituximab plus CT is about 125-150 in 2019.

Incidence of R/R EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT 
Page 10 of 112 
EBV+ PTLD after failure of rituximab affects ~90 to 140 patients following HCT annually in the EU and 
~125 to 150 patients following SOT in the EU. 
Prevalence 
Specific data on the prevalence of EBV+ PTLD in the EU is not available. The prevalence of EBV+ PTLD 
is expected to approximate the incidence of the disease since the survival of these patients is 
approximately 1 to 4 months after first-line treatment failure. 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for the Disease: 
Demographics (Age, Gender, Racial and/or Ethnic Origin) 
Limited data exist on demographics in this population. Regarding ethnic origin, most patients report 
race/ethnicity as White; other demographic criteria are summarised below:  
•  PTLD Following SOT: In the PTLD-1 trial of treatment-naïve adult subjects (N = 70) with PTLD 
following SOT, the median age was 53.3 years (range 16 – 74 years), with 30% of subjects 
≥ 60 years; and 67% of the subjects were male [Trappe 2012]. These demographic patterns 
remained in the long-term analysis of PTLD-1 study with final 152 subjects total: median age 
56.4 years (range 18 – 82 years); 76% males [Trappe 2017]. 
•  PTLD Following HCT: In a recent retrospective analysis of claims database in the US, the 
majority of patients with PTLD following HCT were between 45 and 64 years of age with a 
median age of 54.0 years, and 56.5% were male [Watson 2020]. This combined database included 
US Medicare and a commercial MarketScan databases with 5091 patients with HCT overall, of 
which 92 patients with PTLD following HCT. 
•  Atara studies in the tabelecleucel development programme included subjects with a broad range 
of characteristics and enrolled subjects of all ages [Refer to Module SIII]. 
Risk Factors 
The risk factors common to the development of PTLD following SOT or HCT include the degree of 
T-cell immunosuppression and the EBV serologic status of the recipient, time posttransplant, recipient 
age, and ethnicity [Al-Mansour 2013]. Patient baseline characteristics such as advanced age, especially 
above 50 years, and history of splenectomy also pose significant risk for PTLD development [Al-
Mansour 2013]. Additional risk factors for PTLD following HCT are degree of HLA mismatch, T-cell 
depletion of the bone marrow, and use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-CD3-monocloinal 
antibody for prophylaxis treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) [Curtis 1999]. Major risk 
factors for early PTLD after SOT are well-established and include primary EBV infection in the SOT 
recipient, burden of immunosuppression, and EBV DNA load [Al-Mansour 2013]. As a patient 
accumulates risk factors, the risk of developing PTLD also increases. In one study, individuals with one 
risk factor had a 0.4% risk of developing PTLD, while individuals with 2, 3, 4, and 5 risk factors had an 
increased risk of 3%, 10.4%, 26.5%, and 40%, respectively [Al Hamed 2020]. 
Risk Factors Common to Development of PTLD Following SOT or HCT 
•  Age: Individuals aged < 10 and > 60 years are at increased risk of PTLD following SOT [Al-
Mansour 2013]. A retrospective study that included 92 patients with PTLD after HCT showed 
that most patients who developed PTLD within the first year after transplant were younger than 
65 years (93.2%): 8.7% were younger than 18 years and the mean age was 46.8 years [Barlev 
2018; Watson 2020].

Page 11 of 112 
•  Ethnicity: Higher incidence of PTLD has been reported in White transplant patients compared 
with Black transplant patients, irrespective of recipient EBV serostatus. White patients have been 
shown consistently to be at higher risk for PTLD [Dharnidharka 2001; Dharnidharka 2002; Nee 
2011]. 
•  Degree of immunosuppression: Long-term immunosuppression is the most recognised risk factor 
for late PTLD [San-Juan 2014]. 
Additional Risk Factors for Development of PTLD Following SOT 
•  EBV seronegativity and donor to recipient EBV seromismatch: Since most adults are EBV 
seropositive, donor organs sourced from these adults carry latent EBV that is transmitted along 
with passenger lymphoid tissue to transplant recipients. Patients who are EBV seronegative (not 
yet exposed to EBV) include some children and 8-15% of adult population, both groups are 
susceptible to primary EBV infection posttransplant under immunosuppressive regimen (to 
prevent organ rejection) and, thus, increasing the risk of PTLD due to oncogenic nature of 
EBV[Dharnidharka 2018]. 
Additional Risk Factors for Development of PTLD Following HCT 
•  T-cell depletion: Because of increased number of allogeneic HCTs performed from 
HLA-mismatched or unrelated donors, T-cell depletion strategies are also increasingly used as a 
conditioning regimen. Such strategies include in vivo depletion of T cells using ATG and ex vivo 
depletion by elutriation/density gradient centrifugation. The aim of these strategies is to reduce 
the risk of graft rejection and to reduce the risk of severe GvHD. T-cell depletion also removes 
EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs); this procedure compromises 
T-cell-mediated immunity, thereby increasing the risk of EBV reactivation and development of 
PTLD. Furthermore, the degree of T-cell depletion is associated with risk of PTLD: High dose 
ATG, defined as a total dose of thymoglobulin > 2.5 mg/kg or ATG-F > 5.0 mg/kg, was 
associated with a 2.3-fold higher risk of PTLD than low dose ATG, suggesting that ATG 
increases the risk of PTLD in a dose-dependent manner [Fujimoto 2020]. 
•  HLA mismatch. Styczynski et al demonstrated that the overall incidence of PTLD for a matched 
related donor was 1.16%, compared with 2.86% for a mismatched related donor, 3.97% for a 
matched unrelated donor, and 11.24% for a mismatched unrelated donor [Styczynski 2013]. 
Interestingly, use of cord blood (CB) for the transplant is associated with a 1.5- to 2.0-fold 
increased risk of PTLD when compared with an HLA-mismatched or unrelated donor. According 
to the previous reports on the incidence of PTLD among CB recipients, the incidence of PTLD 
after CB transplantation is around 2.0-4.5% [Fujimoto 2020]. 
•  Other identified risk factors for PTLD following HCT include occurrence of acute or chronic 
GvHD and undergoing a second HCT [Kamble 2020] [Nee 2011]. 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
A significant unmet medical need exists for patients with EBV+ PTLD following either HCT or SOT, 
especially given the lack of approved therapies and rapid decline with high mortality (often within 1 or 
4 months, respectively) observed in those who do not respond to or relapse after initial treatment 
[Dharnidharka 2021; Sanz 2021; Socié 2020; Zimmermann 2019]. In the absence of approved drugs, 
guidelines for the management of PTLD have been developed, as summarised in Table 2. These

guidelines include recommendations for the use of EBV-specific CTLs for treatment of EBV+ PTLD, 
although no such products are currently authorised. 
The de facto international standard of care for first-line therapy of PTLD is rituximab, either as 
monotherapy in both HCT and SOT or as combination therapy with CT agents, eg, R-CHOP, in SOT. 
Rituximab is a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that has become a standard of care in patients with 
polymorphic PTLD, or monomorphic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-like PTLD, who are unresponsive to 
initial reduction in immunosuppression [Shah 2021]. The international phase 2 PTLD-1 trial 
demonstrated the safety and efficacy of sequential therapy of 4 cycles of weekly intravenous (IV) 
rituximab at standard dose (375 mg/m2) followed by 4 cycles of standard dose CHOP-21 CT (50 mg/m2 
doxorubicin; 750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 1.4 mg/m2 vincristine, 50 mg/m2 prednisolone) every 
21 days alongside mandatory granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [Trappe 2017]. Responses 
to first-line therapy, however, are not durable in all cases. In the SOT setting, up to one-third of patients 
fail initial treatment [Trappe 2017]. Rituximab failure, either relapse or failure to respond, is typically 
followed by multiagent CT. Although some patients benefit from CT (R-CHOP/CHOP), it is associated 
with a high treatment-related mortality [Trappe 2017] and both short- and long-term adverse effects 
[Children's Oncology Group 2018; Watson 2019]. In the HCT setting, approximately 50% of PTLD cases 
fail initial treatment [Garcia-Cadenas 2019]. Treatment options for paediatric patients with PTLD follow 
the same treatment algorithms as adults with generally similar outcomes [Mynarek 2013]. 
As a result of the limited treatment options for patients who fail initial therapy, disease progression is 
usually rapid with poor outcomes. In a recent retrospective cohort study of 18 patients who had 
EBV+ PTLD following HCT, the median survival of patients of rituximab-refractory disease was 
1.7 months [Socié 2020]. In patients with EBV+ PTLD following SOT who failed rituximab plus CT or 
did not receive a CT regimen, the median survival was approximately 3 months [Zimmermann 2019]. 
Analysis of an expanded multinational population in 2021 confirmed these findings and underscored the 
continued high unmet need: patients with PTLD following HCT who failed rituximab had a median 
overall survival (OS) of 0.7 months (81 patients) [Sanz 2021]; patients with PTLD following SOT who 
failed CT after initial rituximab had a median OS of 4.1 months (86 patients) [Dharnidharka 2021].

Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity 
Nearly all PTLD cases following HCT are EBV+ [Al-Mansour 2013; Allen 2013; Dierickx 2018; 
Styczynski 2016]. Most cases occur early, within 2-12 months [Jain 2005; Naik 2019; Styczynski 2016] 
of transplantation because of the temporary administration of immunosuppressive therapy [Dierickx 
2018] and prior to patients’ endogenous immune reconstitution. An analysis of a large United States (US) 
claims database and a retrospective chart study including data from US and EU found that the median 
time from HCT to PTLD diagnosis is 90 days [Barlev 2018; Sanz 2021; Socié 2020]. Only 4% of PTLD 
cases occur later than 12 months after HCT, and cases occurring more than 5 years after HCT are very 
rare [Styczynski 2016]. 
In PTLD following SOT, ~50% of cases are found to be EBV+ [Al-Mansour 2013; Dharnidharka 2018; 
Dierickx 2018], with 2 peaks in incidences as follows: 
•  Early-onset PTLD diagnoses peak in the first 2 years after SOT and are more frequently EBV+. 
•  Late-onset PTLD diagnoses peak 5-10 years after SOT and are more frequently EBV-  
[Al-Mansour 2013; Allen 2013; Dierickx 2018; Jagadeesh 2019; Jain 2005]. 
Important Comorbidities 
Fever and lymphadenopathy are the most common symptoms, although some PTLDs develop with 
nonspecific symptoms such as prolonged fever, night sweats, general malaise, and weight loss, and others 
are found incidentally. By contrast, some PTLDs show common symptoms of malignant lymphoma such 
as lymphadenopathy, swelling of tonsils or adenoids, and hepatosplenomegaly. As it progresses, PTLD 
can involve any organ, including bone marrow, liver, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney, even 
the central nervous system in some cases. Thus, PTLD may present with organ-specific symptoms such as 
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or dyspnoea. PTLD after HCT often progresses rapidly, and an 
advanced stage of PTLD is more common in patients after HCT than in those after SOT [Fujimoto 2020]. 
Module SII. 
Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Tabelecleucel is an ex vivo expanded T-cell immunotherapy that has an equivalent mechanism of action 
(MOA) to endogenous circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (targeting EBV antigens through the 
native T-cell receptor [TCR]). Tabelecleucel is not genetically modified. As such, tabelecleucel represents 
a T-cell immunotherapy that shares components of the natural immune response without any component 
of supraphysiologic signaling. 
The nonclinical experience with tabelecleucel supports its specificity and efficacy and demonstrates HLA 
and EBV-antigen specific homing to and accumulation in EBV+ tumours (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). No 
effects have been observed with tabelecleucel beyond those predicted by the natural pharmacology of 
T cells. 
Based on the species-specific nature of tabelecleucel and the limited applicability of non-human 
toxicology models, single dose toxicity studies were not conducted as these studies would yield no 
additional information to aid in the understanding of the potential toxicity of tabelecleucel. Additionally, 
pharmacology studies in preclinical models demonstrated that no overt signs of toxicity (loss of activity, 
weight loss, ruffled hair, ascites, palpable tumours or alloreactivity) were observed with single doses of 
tabelecleucel in murine xenograft models of EBV-induced B-cell lymphoproliferation [Doubrovin 2007; 
Koehne 2003; Lacerda 1996; Lacerda 1997]. Similarly, repeat dose toxicity studies were not conducted as 
these studies would yield no additional information to aid in the understanding of the potential toxicity of 
tabelecleucel in humans.

Carcinogenicity/Tumorigenicity 
Page 16 of 112 
The manufacture of tabelecleucel involves stimulation and sensitisation of donor T cells (obtained from 
EBV-seropositive unrelated donors) cocultured with donor-autologous EBV-transformed B cells (referred 
to as EBV B-lymphoblastoid cell lines [BLCLs]) in the presence of cytokines, thereby stimulating 
expansion of EBV-specific T cells. The EBV-BLCLs are irradiated prior to addition to tabelecleucel 
cultures. As such, the manufacture includes exposure of tabelecleucel drug product intermediate to EBV 
antigens though not to intact EBV virus. As is established, EBV has transformative potential and can be 
oncogenic [Yin 2019]; therefore, the elimination of transformative potential of the virus and/or viral 
transformed cells to the final product was assessed. 
Four nonclinical studies assessed the tumorigenicity potential associated with potential transfer of EBV 
from tabelecleucel (EBV-CTLs) and reagents (such as EBV-BLCL cell lines) to tabelecleucel recipients. 
In summary, results from these studies demonstrated no transformation associated with potential transfer 
of EBV from tabelecleucel or BLCL reagent (RPT-129-1002); and demonstrated clearance of EBV and 
BLCL reagent during the manufacturing process (TRPT-PS-033, TRPT-PD-004, and TRPT-PS-014). 
These nonclinical data show no/low risk for carcinogenicity/tumorigenicity. Consistent with the 
nonclinical findings, no evidence of secondary malignancies attributable to tabelecleucel has been 
observed in patients in clinical studies or expanded access programmes (EAPs) as of the most recent data 
lock point.

Study RPT-129-1002 (EBV Transformation Potential to Cord Blood Cells and Autologous T-Cell 
Depleted Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) 
Transformation associated with potential transfer of EBV B95.8 to CB cells was assessed by using a 
coculture assay 
 BLCL 
reagent and EBV-CTLs (tabelecleucel) used within the same test were of the same donor origin. After 4 
to 6 weeks of culture, cluster formation and cell appearance were recorded. 
These data demonstrate the lack of transformation associated with potential transfer of EBV from 
tabelecleucel or reagents to CB mononuclear cells. 
A similar model was used to determine in vitro transformation associated with potential transfer of EBV 
infection from B95.8 EBV transformed cell line (BLCL) or EBV-CTLs to autologous T-cell-depleted 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
These studies showed no evidence of transformation associated with potential transfer of EBV as a 
component of reagents and products generated with acyclovir treated BLCL reagent.

Studies TRPT-PS-033, TRPT-PD-004 (Clearance of EBV Virus in Tabelecleucel T-Cell Product) 
The tabelecleucel manufacturing process comprises a series of stimulations of EBV-CTLs with BLCL. 
The B95.8 laboratory strain of wildtype EBV reagent used for BLCL transformations is derived from a 
good manufacturing practice master cell bank and tested in compliance with regulatory guidance. Studies 
were conducted to determine the residual infectious levels of EBV in tabelecleucel products at different 
manufacturing steps (
) on harvest day. 
These studies indicate clearance of infectious EBV virus (to below the quantifiable limits from wash 
process to cryo-formulation) in tabelecleucel prior to patient administration and therefore do not raise 
concerns in relation to transmission of transformative EBV. 
Study TRPT-PS-014 (Clearance of Irradiated BLCL in Drug Product) 
Studies were conducted to establish the kinetics of irradiated BLCL clearance during manufacturing of 
tabelecleucel. Data showed clearance of irradiated BLCLs from tabelecleucel cultures. The estimated 
frequency of irradiated BLCL (CD19 positive) cells was 
the number of re-stimulation cycles increased. These findings demonstrate clearance of irradiated BLCL 
in tabelecleucel drug product. 
 The time to reach BLCL clearance decreased as 
Genotoxicity 
As stated in the ICH S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals, the 
range and type of genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals are not applicable to 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. As tabelecleucel is a non-genetically engineered cell product, it 
is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. 
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity 
Due to the species-specific nature of the pharmacology of tabelecleucel, Atara did not perform nonclinical 
reproductive/developmental toxicity studies to support its clinical development. Per ICH S6(R1) and 
ICH S9, the need for reproductive/developmental toxicity studies is dependent upon the product, clinical 
indication, and intended patient population. 
Tabelecleucel is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for women of childbearing potential 
not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised on potential risks for the foetus and potential 
risks to the breastfed child. However, pregnancy is an unlikely event in this population due to the 
underlying disease and previous and concomitant therapies. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
Nonclinical toxicology studies conducted with tabelecleucel were limited to tumorigenicity and EBV and 
BLCL clearance studies; the outcome of these studies is summarised as follows: 
•  Tumorigenicity testing revealed lack of transformation associated with potential transfer of EBV 
to CB cells or autologous T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from tabelecleucel 
(EBV-CTLs) or reagents (such as BLCL reagent) using coculture systems. 
•  Clearance of infectious EBV virus (to below the quantifiable limits from wash process to 
cryo-formulation) from tabelecleucel product. 
•  Clearance of irradiated BLCLs from tabelecleucel product. 
Tabelecleucel is an ex vivo expanded T-cell product that is not genetically modified and has an equivalent 
MOA to endogenous circulating CTLs. As such, tabelecleucel represents a T-cell product that shares 
components of the natural immune response. Based on the species-specific nature of tabelecleucel and

ELIGIBILITY Criterion 
(Study ATA129-EBV-302, 
Protocol Amendment 4, 
15 October 2020) 
Exclusion Criterion 1. 
Burkitt lymphoma, classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma, or any 
T-cell lymphoma 
Reason for Exclusion 
Subjects with these 
malignancies were excluded 
because the expectation for 
these malignancies to respond 
to tabelecleucel was low based 
on the previous clinical 
experience. 
Is the 
Criteria 
Considered 
Missing 
information? 
No 
Rationale for Being 
Considered (or not 
Considered) as Missing 
Information 
There is no expected difference 
in the safety profile for subjects 
with Burkitt lymphoma, 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, 
or any T-cell lymphoma 
compared to the population 
enrolled in

Daily steroids of 
> 0.5 mg/kg prednisone or 
glucocorticoid equivalent, 
ongoing methotrexate, or 
extracorporeal 
photopheresis 
Exclusion Criterion 3. 
Untreated CNS PTLD or 
CNS PTLD for which the 
subject is actively receiving 
CNS-directed 
chemotherapy (systemic or 
intrathecal) or radiotherapy 
at enrollment. NOTE: 
Subjects with previously 
treated CNS PTLD may 
enrol if CNS-directed 
therapy is complete. 
Exclusion Criterion 4. 
Suspected or confirmed 
grade ≥ 2 GvHD per the 
CIBMTR consensus 
grading system at 
enrollment 
Exclusion Criterion 5. 
Ongoing or recent use of a

nivolumab) within 3 drug 
half-lives from the most 
recent dose to enrollment 
Exclusion Criterion 6. 
For HCT cohort only: 
Active adenovirus viremia 
Is the 
Criteria 
Considered 
Missing 
information? 
No 
Reason for Exclusion 
Use of immunosuppressive 
agents can potentially reduce 
tabelecleucel efficacy. 
No 
CNS involvement of PTLD has 
been shown to be associated 
with poor prognosis; therefore, 
subjects with untreated 
CNS PTLD were not enrolled 
in the pivotal study. 
Subjects actively receiving 
treatment for CNS PTLD were 
not enrolled in the pivotal 
study to avoid confounding the 
tabelecleucel study results. 
No 
Given the potential 
overlapping safety profile of 
tabelecleucel and suspected 
GvHD, these subjects were 
excluded to avoid confounding 
the tabelecleucel study results. 
These subjects were excluded 
to avoid confounding the 
tabelecleucel study results with 
those from other therapies. 
No 
No 
Subjects with EBV+ PTLD 
following HCT with ongoing 
uncontrolled infection 
requiring systemic therapy 
were excluded from the study 
to avoid confounding 
tabelecleucel efficacy with the 
effect of concomitant 
immunosuppressive antiviral 
treatment. 
Rationale for Being 
Considered (or not 
Considered) as Missing 
Information 
There is no expected difference 
in the safety profile of subjects 
receiving these 
immunosuppressive agents 
concomitantly with 
tabelecleucel compared to the

Important Identified Risk: Tumour flare reaction (TFR) 
Risk-benefit impact: Tumour flare reaction (TFR) is an established adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
associated with the use of tabelecleucel. Tumour flare reaction occurred at a low frequency with 1 of 
103 subjects (1.0%)1 reporting TFR in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201. No 
treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) of TFR was reported in the other clinical 
studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99) and 3 patients reported TESAEs of TFRs in the EAPs 
(ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138). All 4 events were considered at least possibly related 
by the investigator (in clinical studies) or treating physician (in EAPs); 1 was grade 4, 2 were grade 3, and 
1 Frequency was determined from clinical studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 which systematically 
collected treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including serious and nonserious. The other clinical studies 
(11-130 and 95-024) and EAPs collected TESAEs.

1 was grade 2. Depending on the anatomic tumour location, there is a potential for severe complications. 
As TFR can be life-threatening, it is considered an important identified risk. 
Important Identified Risk: Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) 
Risk-benefit impact: Graft-versus-host disease (including in gastrointestinal tract and in liver, and rash 
maculo-papular [skin GvHD]) is an ADR associated with the use of tabelecleucel. Graft-versus-host 
disease occurred at a low frequency with 5 of 103 subjects (4.9%)1 reporting GvHD in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201. An additional 9 subjects reported GvHD in the other 
clinical studies and EAPs (N = 99 and N = 138, respectively). The majority of the events were considered 
unrelated by the investigator (in clinical studies) or treating physician (in EAPs) and 8 were grade ≥ 3. 
Although the GvHD cases were confounded by other risk factors such as transplant history and decrease 
of immunosuppressants for PTLD as per standard of care, the contribution of tabelecleucel to risk of 
developing GvHD cannot be excluded based on the MOA of an allogeneic therapy. As GvHD can be 
life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is considered an important identified risk. 
Important Potential Risk: Solid organ transplant (SOT) rejection 
Risk-benefit impact: The evidence of SOT rejection after administration of tabelecleucel in patients with 
previous allogeneic donor-derived SOT is limited, as the small number of reported cases of SOT rejection 
after administration of tabelecleucel had other risk factors including decrease of immunosuppressants as 
standard of care or a medical history of previous episodes of SOT rejection. SOT rejection occurred at a 
low frequency with 1 of 40 (2.5%)1 subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT reporting SOT rejection in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, which was nonserious, grade 1, and considered unrelated 
by the investigator. None of the subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT reported a TESAE of SOT 
rejection in the other clinical studies (11-130, and 95-024; N = 11). Three patients reported grade 1 or 2 
TESAEs of SOT rejection in the EAPs (ATA129-EBV-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 43); 1 event was 
considered possibly related by the treating physician. As SOT rejection can be life-threatening or cause 
chronic comorbidities, it is considered an important potential risk. 
Important Potential Risk: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection 
Risk-benefit impact: There is a theoretical risk of tabelecleucel-mediated cytotoxic damage in patients 
who have had HCT. None of the subjects who were treated with tabelecleucel for EBV+ PTLD following 
HCT reported an event of BMT rejection in the clinical studies (ATA129-EBV-302, EBV-CTL-201, 11-
130, and 95-024; N = 59)1 or in the EAPs (ATA129-EBV-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 30)1. As BMT 
rejection can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is considered an important potential 
risk. 
Important Potential Risk: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
Risk-benefit impact: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been observed with antibody therapies and 
non-protein-based cancer therapies but has shown particularly high incidence rate and pronounced 
morbidity in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cellular immune therapy [Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 
2018]. However, CRS occurred at a low frequency after administration of tabelecleucel with none of the 
subjects reporting any event in the clinical studies (ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 [N = 103], 
11-130 and 95-024 [N = 99])1. Two patients reported grade 1 events; 1 event was considered possibly 
related by the treating physician in the EAPs (ATA129-EBV-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138). These 
reported cases of CRS had confounding factors suggesting that tabelecleucel is not associated with CRS. 
Cytokine release syndrome is considered an important potential risk due to its potential for severe 
outcomes if left untreated.

Important Potential Risk: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) 
Risk-benefit impact: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) has been observed 
with particularly high incidence rate and pronounced morbidity in CAR-T cellular immune therapy and 
anti-CD19 immunotherapies [Lee 2019; Sheth 2021]. There have been no reports of the preferred term 
(PT): ICANS in the clinical development programme (clinical studies: ATA129-EBV-302 and 
EBV-CTL-201 [N = 103] and 11-130 and 95-024 [N = 99], and EAPs: ATA129-EBV-901 and 
ATA129-SPU [N = 138]), as of the data lock point. With a broadened search strategy, only 
1 grade ≥ 3 event of grade 3 confusional state considered related by the investigator was reported in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome 
is considered an important potential risk due to its potential for severe outcomes. 
Important Potential Risk: Infusion-related reactions (IRR) 
Risk-benefit impact: Based on its biological nature and mode of administration, tabelecleucel has a 
theoretical risk of causing infusion-related reactions (IRRs). None of the subjects reported IRR in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-2011. Four subjects reported TESAEs of IRR in the other 
clinical studies and EAPs (N = 99 and N = 138, respectively). Two of the events were considered at least 
possibly related by the investigator (in clinical studies) or treating physician (in EAPs) and all were 
grade ≤ 2 with most cases presenting with low grade fever and confounded by other risk factors. As IRR 
can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities it is considered an important potential risk.  
Important Potential Risk: Immunogenicity 
Risk-benefit impact: Anti-HLA antibodies can reduce the efficacy of tabelecleucel and can cause safety 
events such as SOT rejection and hypersensitivity that may require medical intervention. There were no 
cases of lack of efficacy reported in the clinical development programme1 as described in the decrease in 
cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product below and a limited number of SOT rejection as 
well as hypersensitivity events. No AEs of immunogenicity were specific to development of anti-HLA 
antibodies, and therefore, no definitive conclusions regarding the association of HLA antibody positivity 
with immunogenicity adverse events can be drawn. Immunogenicity is considered an important potential 
risk due to their potential for severe outcomes.  
Important Potential Risk: Transmission of infectious agents (including cytomegalovirus [CMV]) 
Risk-benefit impact: Tabelecleucel is obtained from human donor blood cells. Donors are screened and 
must test negative for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases, including hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although tabelecleucel lots 
are tested for sterility, mycoplasma, and adventitious agents, a risk of transmission of infectious agents 
exists. No cases of transmission of infectious agents have been reported after tabelecleucel administration 
in the clinical development programme1. 
Some tabelecleucel lots are manufactured from donors who are cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive. All lots 
are tested to ensure no detection of adventitious agents, including CMV. During clinical development, 
tabelecleucel lots derived from CMV-positive donors were administered to CMV-negative patients when 
an appropriate lot derived from a CMV-seronegative donor was unavailable; in this subpopulation no 
seroconversions were observed. Due to the theoretical potential of transmission of infectious agents, 
transmission of infectious agents (including CMV) is considered an important potential risk.

Important Potential Risk: Decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product 
Risk-benefit impact: No medication error or lack of efficacy that may have resulted from a decrease in 
cell viability due to inappropriate handling of tabelecleucel have been reported in the clinical 
development programme1. Because of the seriousness of the treated pathology, decrease in cell viability 
due to inappropriate handling of the product is considered an important potential risk.  
Missing Information: Use in paediatric population 
Risk-benefit impact: A total of 340 subjects have been treated with tabelecleucel, 254 (74.7%) were 
≥ 18 years of age and 86 (25.3%) were < 18 years of age, as of the data lock point. Among the paediatric 
group, 3 (0.9%) were < 2, 20 (5.9%) were ≥ 2 to < 6, 31 (9.1%) were ≥ 6 to < 12, and 32 (9.4%) were 
≥ 12 to < 18 years of age. Based on the rare disease indication further safety data collection in the 
postmarketing setting is required. 
Missing Information: Use in elderly population 
Risk-benefit impact: A total of 340 subjects have been treated with tabelecleucel, 288 (84.7%) were 
< 65 years of age and 52 (15.3%) were ≥ 65 years of age, as of the data lock point. Among the elderly 
group, 41 (12.1%) were ≥ 65 to < 75, 11 (3.2%) were ≥ 75 to < 85, and 0 were ≥ 85 years of age. Based 
on the rare disease indication, further safety data collection in the postmarketing setting is required. 
Missing Information: Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Risk-benefit impact: No information is available with tabelecleucel use in pregnant women as pregnant 
and breastfeeding women were excluded from the clinical development programme. No animal 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with tabelecleucel. It is not known 
if tabelecleucel has the potential to be transferred to the foetus or can cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. It is unknown whether tabelecleucel is excreted in human milk or 
transferred to the breastfeeding child. Based on the rare disease indication further safety data collection in 
the postmarketing setting is required. 
Missing Information: Long-term safety information 
Risk-benefit impact: In Study ATA129-EBV-302, systematic safety data collection occurred through 
2 years after first dose for events considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related. All subjects 
have a minimum of systematic safety data collection for 18 months and up to 23 months after last dose. 
Additional long-term safety data collection is required in the postmarketing setting to confirm the 
long-term safety profile in an ultra-rare indication.

Important Identified Risk: Tumour Flare Reaction (TFR)

immunotherapy, as the process of immune activation may potentially be delayed. The tumour may grow 
transiently during the period of immune activation and before an effective antitumour response occurs. 
In the past decade, TFR was considered as a new side effect associated with immunomodulatory agents 
and as a condition of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Tumour flare reaction is also observed in solid 
tumours treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several cases of flare reaction with hormonotherapy 
and haematologic malignancies and manifestations of TFR possibly mimicking disease progression have 
been reported. Tumour flare reaction is also observed in solid tumours treated with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, though TFR is less common in solid tumours [Taleb 2019]. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: Tumour flare reaction was identified in the tabelecleucel 
clinical development programme as ADR based on a plausible MOA and aggregate review of all TFR 
events, which include a case with positive rechallenge. Therefore, and due to the potential to be 
life-threatening TFR is considered an important identified risk.  
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched for Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) PT: tumour flare (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse 
events or TESAEs were defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel 
through 30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined 
using a severity grading system, which could have been either the common terminology criteria for 
adverse events (CTCAE) or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) 
and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 1 of 103 subjects (1.0%)1 reported TFR: 0 with 
EBV+ PTLD and 1 with non-PTLD. The event was serious, grade 3, and considered related by the 
investigator. The outcome of TFR in this subject was reported as recovered by the time of the data lock 
point. 
In the other 2 clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99), no TESAE of TFR was reported. 
In the 2 EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138), 3 patients reported TESAEs of TFR. Of 
the 3 events, 1 was grade 4, 1 was grade 3, and 1 was grade 2, and all were considered possibly related by 
the treating physician. Of the 3 patients with TFR, 2 were not recovered and 1 was recovered by the time 
of the data lock point. 
All 4 cases occurred shortly after first dose. One grade 3 TFR case described in a subject with 
 had a positive rechallenge following the second dose. The highest severity was the grade 4 TFR 
case with right 
 occurred in the context of 
, events of grade 4 respiratory failure, grade 5 septic shock, as well as a positive test for 
clostridium difficile toxin A/B, both events (respiratory failure and septic shock) were assessed as 
unrelated by the treating physician to tabelecleucel. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: The patients at risk of severe TFR are those with high tumour burden prior 
to treatment [Chanan-Khan 2011; Taleb 2019]. Depending on the anatomic location of the tumour or 
lymphadenopathy, complications may arise from mass effect including compression and/or obstruction of 
adjacent anatomic structures.  
Preventability: Monitoring for signs and symptoms and potential pretreatment for high-risk patients are 
included in the product information as routine risk minimisation measures. Appropriate monitoring, early 
detection, anti-inflammatory therapy, and supportive treatments as needed per institutional standards may 
modulate the severity [Taleb 2019]. 
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: Tumour flare reaction occurred at a low subject 
incidence rate of 1.0% in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201.

Depending on the anatomic tumour location, there is a potential for severe complications. Tabelecleucel is 
a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a clinical setting 
under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals. PTLD patients are managed under the 
care of trained physicians who have experience in treating these complicated diseases and in evaluating 
the risks associated with TFR. Tumour flare reaction is a manageable event, treated by supportive care as 
appropriate. Even though rare severe cases of TFR are described in the literature with other agents, 
symptoms described with other agents were usually mild and responded to anti-inflammatory therapy 
[Taleb 2019]. 
Therefore, routine risk minimisation measures described in the product information are considered 
sufficient to manage this risk. It is expected that further data collection in the postmarketing setting via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk is sufficiently managed through routine 
risk minimisation measures. 
Tabelecleucel provides meaningful benefit to an advanced oncology population with limited treatment 
options and a rapidly compromised prognosis in the absence of treatment. Based on available data, the 
risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Identified Risk: Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) 
Potential Mechanisms: Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy which targets 
and eliminates EBV expressing cells in an HLA-restricted manner. Tabelecleucel is partially HLA 
matched and has a theoretical risk of alloreactivity. The potential risk of tabelecleucel-mediated cytotoxic 
damage that could theoretically occur in host tissues may be due to non-EBV alloreactivity and antigenic 
mimicry, may occur in any treated subject (with or without transplant history), and may be clinically 
indistinguishable from donor-mediated GvHD. Since tabelecleucel has a restricted T-cell repertoire 
[Benoun 2021], and therefore, the ability to target host extra-tumoural tissues is reduced, the risk of 
GvHD is mitigated. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: Graft-versus-host disease was identified in the 
tabelecleucel clinical development programme as an ADR based on a plausible MOA. A causal 
relationship between tabelecleucel and GvHD cannot be excluded. Each tabelecleucel lot within the 
product inventory is tested for specificity of lysis of EBV+ targets, T-cell HLA restriction of specific lysis, 
and verification of low alloreactivity. The tabelecleucel lot is selected for each patient from the existing 
product inventory based on an appropriate HLA restriction.  
As GvHD can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is considered an important identified 
risk. 
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA PTs were searched 
for the terms “graft” and “host” and “versus”; in addition, the investigator in the clinical studies or 
treating physician in the EAPs classified the event as GvHD, which was considered an adverse event of 
special interest (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were 
defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, 
inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a severity 
grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 5 of 103 subjects (4.9%)1 reported GvHD: 4 with 
EBV+ PTLD and 1 with non-PTLD. Of the 5 subjects, 2 reported 3 serious events (1 with 2 grade 4 events 
considered possibly related by the investigator, and the other with a grade 2 event considered unrelated by 
the investigator) and 3 reported nonserious events (1 with a grade 3 event [rash maculo-papular] 
considered possibly related and 2 with grade 1 events considered unrelated by the investigator). Of the

5 subjects with GvHD, 1 was not recovered (with the 2 serious grade 4 events) and 4 were recovered by 
the time of the data lock point.  
In the other 2 clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99), 3 subjects with EBV+ PTLD reported 3 events 
of GvHD. Two events were serious, 1 grade 4 considered unlikely related by the investigator and 
1 grade 3 considered unrelated by the investigator, and 1 was nonserious (grade 3 and considered unlikely 
related by the investigator). Of the 3 subjects with GvHD, all were recovered by the time of the data lock 
point. 
In the EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138), 6 patients reported GvHD, 4 with 
5 serious events (1 grade 5 considered unrelated, 2 grade 4 considered unlikely related by the treating 
physician, 1 grade 3 considered unrelated by the treating physician, and 1 grade 1 considered related by 
the treating physician) and 2 with nonserious events (1 grade 2 and 1 grade 1, both considered unrelated). 
Of the 6 patients with GvHD, 1 was fatal, 3 were not recovered, and 2 were recovered by the time of the 
data lock point. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing GvHD after tabelecleucel administration. 
Preventability: The discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of PTLD may 
trigger the occurrence of GvHD. Monitoring for signs and symptoms are included in the product 
information as routine risk minimisation measures and early treatment is indicated as clinically 
appropriate per institutional standards.  
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: Graft-versus-host disease occurred at a subject 
incidence rate of 4.9% in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201. The incidence rate of GvHD in 
the tabelecleucel clinical development programme was lower than the background incidence rate of acute 
GvHD which is estimated to be approximately 30-50% of patients after allogeneic HCT [Malard 2020]. 
All GvHD cases were confounded by transplant history, medical history of previous episodes of GvHD, 
or reduction in immunosuppressive treatment prior to the events due to standard of care. A few cases were 
not histologically confirmed, including 2 out of the 3 cases assessed as treatment-related by the sites, and 
the diagnosis of GvHD was hypothetical. 
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a 
clinical setting under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals. As part of their 
posttransplant clinical management and high risk for GvHD post-HCT, PTLD patients are closely 
monitored by experienced healthcare professionals and early detection and treatment of GvHD per 
institutional standards would be expected.  
Therefore, routine risk minimisation measures described in the product information are considered 
sufficient to manage this risk. It is expected that further data collection in the postmarketing setting via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk is sufficiently managed through routine 
risk minimisation measures.  
Tabelecleucel provides meaningful benefit to an advanced oncology population with limited treatment 
options and rapidly compromised prognosis in the absence of treatment.  
Based on available data, the risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain 
favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low.

Important Potential Risk: Solid organ transplant (SOT) rejection  
Potential Mechanisms: Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy which targets 
and eliminates EBV expressing cells in an HLA-restricted manner. Tabelecleucel is partially HLA 
matched and has a theoretical risk of SOT rejection based on humoral or cell-mediated immune reactions. 
The potential risk of tabelecleucel-mediated graft rejection may be due to non-EBV alloreactivity and 
antigenic mimicry and may be clinically indistinguishable from other mechanisms of SOT-mediated 
rejection. 
For patients with SOT, administration of tabelecleucel sharing HLA alleles with the transplanted organ 
but not shared with the patient`s immune system poses the risk of generation of cross-reactive anti-HLA 
antibodies that could mediate SOT rejection. This risk is considered a potential risk. There were no 
reports of anti-HLA antibody-mediated rejection among the reported cases of SOT rejection in the 
tabelecleucel clinical development programme (including the 4 clinical studies and 2 EAPs). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: The evidence of SOT rejection after administration of 
tabelecleucel in patients with previous allogeneic donor-derived SOT is limited, as the small number of 
reported cases of SOT rejection after administration of tabelecleucel had other risk factors including 
decrease of immunosuppressants as standard of care or a medical history of previous episodes of SOT 
rejection. As SOT rejection can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is considered an 
important potential risk. 
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA HLTs were 
searched for the term “transplant rejection” or MedDRA PTs were searched for the terms “engraft” within 
the SOT cohort (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were 
defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, 
inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a severity 
grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 1 of 40 (2.5%)1 subjects with EBV+ PTLD following 
SOT reported SOT rejection (the event was nonserious, grade 1, and considered unrelated by the 
investigator). This subject had a medical history of 
the first dose of tabelecleucel. The subject recovered by the time of the data lock point. 
 rejection prior to 
 and 
In the other clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 11), none of the subjects with EBV+ PTLD 
following SOT reported a TESAE of SOT rejection. 
In the EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 43), 3 of the patients with EBV+ PTLD 
following SOT reported TESAEs of SOT rejection. Two of the events were grade 2 and considered 
unrelated by the treating physician and 1 was grade 1 and considered possibly related by the treating 
physician. The patient had another episode of transplant rejection a few months after the end of 
tabelecleucel treatment that was reported as unrelated to the product; both episodes were similar in 
presentation, and both were histologically confirmed as cellular rejection. Of the 3 patients with SOT 
rejection, 1 was not recovered and 2 were recovered by the time of the data lock point. [Van Herck 2017] 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing SOT rejection after tabelecleucel administration. 
Preventability: The discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of PTLD may 
trigger the occurrence of SOT rejection. Monitoring for signs and symptoms are included in the product 
information as risk routine minimisation measures and early treatment is indicated as clinically 
appropriate per institutional standards.

Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: Overall, the incidence rate in the clinical development 
programme was lower than the allogeneic donor-derived SOT-mediated rejection rate reported in 
literature:  
•  Heart Transplant: Overall, the incidence of SOT rejection events in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 
and EBV-CTL-201 (1 of 8 subjects with heart transplants) was not higher than the rates of 
corresponding SOT rejections reported in literature. According to the registry of the International 
Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation, approximately 20% to 40% of heart transplant 
recipients will experience at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection in the first postoperative 
year [Stehlik 2012].  
•  Lung and Liver Transplant: Similarly, patients with lung and liver transplant have a high risk of 
transplant rejection. The registry data from the International Society for Heart and Lung 
Transplantation show that about a third of patients will have at least one episode of treated 
rejection in the first year after transplantation [Yusen 2016]. Survival following lung 
transplantation remains worse compared with other SOT types, with a median survival of 6 years 
[Parulekar 2019]. Survival is limited by the development of chronic rejection that occurred in 
45% of patients within 5 years posttransplant [Van Herck 2017]. Acute allograft rejection remains 
a common complication of liver transplantation, with an incidence ranging from 20% to 40% 
[Dogan 2018]. 
The strength of evidence for SOT rejection after tabelecleucel administration seems limited, however, 
further data will be collected in the postmarketing setting. 
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a 
clinical setting under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals. As part of their 
posttransplant clinical management of PTLD, patients are closely monitored by experienced healthcare 
professionals and early detection and treatment of SOT rejection per institutional standards would be 
expected. Therefore, routine risk minimisation measures described in the product information are 
considered sufficient to manage this risk. It is expected that further data collection in the postmarketing 
setting via routine pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk is sufficiently managed through 
routine risk minimisation measures.  
Tabelecleucel provides meaningful benefit to an advanced oncology population with limited treatment 
options and rapidly compromised prognosis in the absence of treatment. Based on available data, the 
risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection  
Potential Mechanisms: Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy which targets 
and eliminates EBV expressing cells in an HLA-restricted manner. Tabelecleucel is partially HLA 
matched and has a theoretical risk of BMT rejection based on humoral or cell-mediated immune 
reactions. The potential risk of tabelecleucel-mediated graft rejection may be due to non-EBV 
alloreactivity and antigenic mimicry, which may be clinically indistinguishable from other mechanisms of 
BMT rejection [Hows 1991].

Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: There is no evidence of BMT rejection after administration 
of tabelecleucel in patients with previous allogeneic donor-derived HCT, as no cases have been reported 
in the clinical development programme. In addition, a severely diminished host immune system after 
HCT would limit the potential for immune reactions [Kroger 2006; van der Maas 2019]. As BMT 
rejection can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is considered an important potential 
risk. 
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA HLTs were 
searched for the term “transplant rejection” or MedDRA PTs were searched for the terms “engraft” within 
the HCT cohort (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were 
defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, 
inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a severity 
grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, none of 281 subjects with EBV+ PTLD following HCT 
reported BMT rejection.  
In the other clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 31) and EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and 
ATA129-SPU; N = 30), none of the subjects with EBV+ PTLD following HCT reported BMT rejection. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing HCT graft after tabelecleucel administration. 
Preventability: Appropriate monitoring of BMT rejection signs and symptoms and early treatment is 
indicated as clinically appropriate per institutional standards.  
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: No cases of BMT rejection were reported in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 and strength of evidence seems extremely limited; 
however, further data will be collected in the postmarketing setting. 
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a

risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  
Potential Mechanisms: Infusion of T-cell therapy may activate bystander immune cells and non-immune 
cells resulting in supraphysiologic release of cytokines leading to a systemic inflammatory response. 
Cytokine release syndrome has been seen in antibody therapies and non-protein-based cancer therapies 
but has shown particularly high incidence rate and pronounced morbidity in CAR-T cellular immune 
therapy [Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 2018].  
Cytokine release syndrome is a well-established risk for CAR-T therapies, which generally manifests 
within 7-14 days of drug administration, and has a clear association with their MOA [Lee 2019; Maude

2018; Neelapu 2017; Schuster 2019]. Lymphodepletion typically precedes CAR-T administration to 
allow for expansion of the CAR-T cells, the resulting peak in CAR-T expansion is associated with the 
cytokine burst [Hay 2017]. Following administration of tabelecleucel no cytokine bursts have been 
associated with EBV-CTLp expansion (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Section 2.2 and 
5.3.4.2 ATA129-EBV-302 Biomarker Report Section 4.2.2). Tabelecleucel is an activated T-cell which 
once administered is expected to target and specifically kill EBV+ target cells [Benoun 2021]. Once 
target cells are gone tabelecleucel is expected to be exhausted and not persist long-term [Prockop 2020]. 
Therefore, based upon the activated phenotype of tabelecleucel and no observations of cytokine increases 
associated with EBV-CTLp peak expansion, the risk of CRS following tab-cel administration is low.  
Tabelecleucel is an ex vivo expanded T-cell product that is not genetically modified and has an equivalent 
MOA to endogenous circulating CTLs.  
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: There was no case of CRS reported in any of the 4 clinical 
studies. Two patients with confounding factors (ie, 
) reported grade 1 CRS case each in the EAPs. This low incidence rate and severity of CRS 
with tabelecleucel suggests that tabelecleucel is not associated with CRS, since in contrast the rates 
observed with CAR-T-cell therapies is higher: a systematic review and meta-analysis across 9 clinical 
studies of CAR-T therapies in B-cell malignancies reported pooled CRS rates of 59.3% (95% CI 30.5%, 
88.1%) [Chattaraj 2022] and among 4 CAR-T therapies, grade ≥ 3 events were reported at rates of 4-77% 
[Sengsayadeth 2022]. Cytokine release syndrome is considered an important potential risk due to its 
potential for severe outcomes if left untreated.  
To study the potential risk of CRS in association with tabelecleucel, cytokines commonly associated with 
CRS were analysed in 45 subjects with EBV+ PTLD and other EBV+ diseases enrolled in clinical studies 
(ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201) who had evaluable data (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology Section 2.2). Samples from these subjects were collected and a panel of 4 analytes (ie, 
interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-α) encompassing inflammatory, 
immune-modulating, and immune effector-related molecules were measured at various time points prior 
to and after infusion of tabelecleucel. The evaluation of plasma cytokine levels revealed very little 
modulation from baseline in these studies, supporting no causal relationship of tabelecleucel with CRS.  
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA PTs were searched 
for the term “cytokine”; in addition, the investigator in the clinical studies or treating physician in the 
EAPs classified the event as CRS, which was considered an adverse event of special interest (refer to 
Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were defined as any AE or 
SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of 
tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a severity grading system, which could have 
been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) and 
summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-2011, none of 103 subjects reported CRS. 
In the other 2 clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99), no TESAE of CRS was reported. 
In the EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138), 2 patients reported CRS; both events were 
grade 1 with 1 serious and considered possibly related by the treating physician and the other nonserious 
and considered unrelated by the treating physician. Of the 2 patients with CRS, 1 was not recovered and 1 
was recovered by the time of the data lock point. The nonserious grade 1 CRS event occurred after 
first dose of tabelecleucel in context of

Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: There was no case of CRS reported in the clinical

risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) 
Potential Mechanisms: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome is a common toxicity that 
can occur following CAR-T cell therapy and anti-CD19 immunotherapies [Lee 2019]. The proposed 
MOA for developing ICANS suggests roles for endothelial activation and disruption of the blood-brain 
barrier [Gust 2017]. One mechanism that may increase the risk of ICANS development following anti-
CD19 targeting immunotherapies is due to the presence of CD19 on mural brain cells which support the 
vasculature of the brain and play a role in maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity [Parker 2020]. These 
CD19+ brain cells represent an on-target off-tumour effect for anti-CD19 immunotherapies and likely play 
a role in the development of ICANS in patients treated with these therapies.  
As tabelecleucel is an EBV-specific T-cell therapy, this MOA in decreasing the integrity of the blood-
brain barrier is unlikely; furthermore, these cells are not expected to present antigens recognised by 
tabelecleucel.  
While it remains a theoretical possibility that in patients with systemic inflammation who may already 
have impaired blood-brain barrier integrity, activated T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier; however, 
no evidence of neurotoxicity has been observed in patients treated with virus-specific, expanded T cells 
[Simmons 2019]. Due to this theoretical possibility, but no reported event of ICANS in the clinical 
development programme, as of the data lock point, and with the low incidence and severity of related 
events from broader search criteria, the risk of ICANS following tabelecleucel administration is 
considered low. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: As of the data lock point, there have been no reports of the 
PT: ICANS in the clinical development programme. Applying a broader search criterion, only 1

grade ≥ 3 event of grade 3 confusional state considered related by the investigator was reported in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201. The majority of events within the broader search criteria 
were assessed as not related and occurred in the context of confounding factors. This low incidence rate 
and severity of possible ICANS associated neurological toxicities with tabelecleucel suggests that 
tabelecleucel is not associated with ICANS, since in contrast the rates observed with CAR-T-cell 
therapies is higher: a systematic review and meta-analysis across 9 clinical studies of CAR-T therapies in 
B-cell malignancies reported pooled ICANS rates of 15.4% (95% CI 4.6%, 26.3%) [Chattaraj 2022] and 
among 4 CAR-T therapies, grade ≥ 3 events were reported at rates of 12-40% [Sengsayadeth 2022]. 
ICANS is considered an important potential risk due to its potential for severe outcomes if left untreated. 
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched for the standardised MedDRA query 
(SMQ): noninfectious encephalopathy_delirium (narrow or broad). Treatment-emergent adverse events or 
TESAEs were defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 
30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a 
severity grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, 
moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20).  
There have been no reports of the PT: ICANS in the clinical development programme (4 clinical studies: 
ATA129-EBV-302, EBV-CTL-201, 11-130, 95-024, and 2 EAPs: ATA129-EBV-901 and 
ATA129-SPU), as of the data lock point. The search strategy was broadened to capture potentially 
associated neurological events. Adverse drug reactions observed with this broader search strategy 
included muscular weakness, depressed level of consciousness, somnolence, confusional state, delirium, 
and disorientation. 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 26 of 103 subjects (25.2%)1 experienced these TEAEs 
from the noninfectious encephalopathy_delirium SMQ (16 with EBV+ PTLD and 10 with non-PTLD) 
with 3 subjects (2.9%) experiencing treatment-related TEAEs. The treatment-related events included: 1 
grade 3 confusional state with an outcome of not recovered and grade 2 delirium, and depressed level of 
consciousness, disorientation, muscular weakness, and somnolence reported in 1 subject each with 3 
outcomes of not recovered and 2 recovered. Of the 26 subjects experiencing these neurological TEAEs, 9 
had grade ≥ 3 events: 1 had grade 4 depressed level of consciousness, and 8 had grade 3 events: 
encephalopathy (3 subjects), muscular weakness (3 subjects), delirium (2 subjects), seizure (1 subject), 
somnolence (2 subjects), confusional state (1 subject), dysphagia (1 subject), agitation (1 subject), 
hypersomnia (1 subject). Of the 26 subjects experiencing these neurological TEAEs, outcomes were not 
recovered for 13, recovering for 2, and recovered for 16 by the time of the data lock point. The 
neurological events occurring in 23 of 26 subjects were assessed as not related by the investigator and 
occurred in the context of an advanced oncology population with multiple comorbidities and/or disease 
progression.  
In the 4 clinical studies (ATA129-EBV-302, EBV-CTL-201, 11-130, and 95-024; N = 202), 16 subjects 
experienced these TESAEs from the noninfectious encephalopathy_delirium SMQ (7 with EBV+ PTLD 
and 9 with non-PTLD) with 2 subjects experiencing treatment-related events: a grade 3 mental status 
changes and a grade 2 depressed level of consciousness (described above). Of the 16 subjects 
experiencing these neurological TESAEs, 12 had grade ≥ 3 events: 4 had grade 4 events: 3 with depressed 
level of consciousness (1 described above), and 1 with encephalopathy; and 8 had grade 3 events: 2 with 
confusional state, 2 with mental state changes, 1 with seizure (described above), 1 with delirium 
(described above), 1 with muscular weakness, and 1 with dysphagia. Of the 16 subjects reporting these 
neurological TESAEs, the outcomes were not recovered for 6, recovering for 1, recovered for 2, and 2 
had an unknown or missing outcome by the time of the data lock point. The neurological events occurring 
in 14 of 16 subjects were assessed as not related by the investigator and occurred in the context of an 
advanced oncology population with multiple comorbidities and/or disease progression.

Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA PTs were searched 
for the terms “infusion” and “related”, and the event(s) occurred within 24 hours after the infusion; in 
addition, the investigator in the clinical studies or treating physician in the EAPs classified the event as 
IRR, which was considered an adverse event of special interest (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after 
the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity 
of each AE was determined using a severity grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or 
categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst 
grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-2011, none of the 103 subjects reported IRR.  
In the other 2 clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99), 3 subjects reported TEASEs of IRR: 2 
grade 2 events (PT: pyrexia) with 1 considered possibly related by the investigator and 1 considered 
unlikely related by the investigator, and 1 grade 1 event (PT: noncardiac chest pain) considered unlikely 
related by the investigator. Of the 3 subjects with IRR, 1 was recovering and 2 were recovered by the time 
of the data lock point.  
In the EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and ATA129-SPU; N = 138), 1 patient reported a TESAE of IRR 
(pyrexia) that was grade 1 and considered possibly related by the treating physician. The patient 
recovered from the event by the time of the data lock point. These events were associated with 
concomitant disease or had negative rechallenge following tabelecleucel re-administration.  
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing IRR after tabelecleucel administration. 
Preventability: Monitoring for signs and symptoms are included in the product information as routine risk 
minimisation measures and early treatment is indicated as clinically appropriate per institutional 
standards.  
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:  
No cases of IRR were reported in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 and the other cases 
were confounded but there is a theoretical risk based on the biological nature and mode of administration 
of tabelecleucel for which further data will be collected in the postmarketing setting. 
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subjected to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a 
clinical setting under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals.  
As part of their posttransplant clinical management, PTLD patients are closely monitored by experienced 
healthcare professionals and early detection, and treatment of IRR per institutional standards would be 
expected.

Important Potential Risk: Immunogenicity  
Page 59 of 112 
Potential Mechanisms: Therapeutic proteins are recognised by the human immune system. This 
recognition is often followed by an immune response to therapeutic proteins. This potentially harmful 
immune response is complex and, in addition to antibody formation, involves T-cell activation and innate 
immune responses. The consequences of an immune reaction to a therapeutic protein range from transient 
appearance of antibodies without any clinical significance to severe life-threatening conditions. Potential 
clinical consequences of an unwanted immune response include loss of efficacy of the therapeutic protein 
and serious acute immune effects such as anaphylaxis [EMA CHMP 2017].  
Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy which targets and eliminates EBV 
expressing cells in an HLA-restricted manner. Tabelecleucel is partially HLA matched and has a 
theoretical risk of immunogenicity based on humoral or cell-mediated immune reactions. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: HLA antibodies can potentially reduce the efficacy of 
tabelecleucel and can cause clinical manifestations of immunogenicity such as anaphylaxis and SOT 
rejection that may require medical intervention. No immunogenicity adverse events were specific to 
development of anti-HLA antibodies therefore, no definitive conclusions regarding the association of 
HLA antibody positivity with immunogenicity adverse events can be drawn, and hence, immunogenicity 
is an important potential risk. 
Characterisation of the Risk: Immunogenicity was characterised by evaluation of anti-HLA antibody 
antibodies and cases of SOT rejection. In addition, the clinical database was searched for SMQ: 
hypersensitivity (narrow) or SMQ: lack of efficacy (narrow). Treatment-emergent adverse events or 
TESAEs were defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 
30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a 
severity grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, 
moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Study ATA129-EBV-302, anti-HLA antibody data was examined to determine if tabelecleucel may 
invoke a humoral immune response toward one or more allogeneic HLA after infusion. Only 7 (5 with 
EBV+ PTLD following SOT and 2 in with EBV+ PTLD following HCT) of the 35 subjects with anti-HLA 
antibody data had negative tests before treatment and then were subsequently evaluated with at least one 
postinfusion test (5.3.5.4 ATA129-EBV-302 Biomarker Report Section 4.3.3.2). Of these 7 subjects, 1 
developed anti-HLA antibodies after treatment. There was no indication of a clinical manifestation 
(hypersensitivity, SOT rejection, or lack of efficacy) due to anti-HLA antibodies from the adverse events 
reported for this single subject.  
There were no cases of lack of efficacy reported in the clinical development programme as described in 
the decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product below. 
The following hypersensitivity data presentation is based on an SMQ search. No life-threatening 
potentially anaphylactic reactions were observed. In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 23 
of 103 (22.3%)1 subjects reported hypersensitivity with 3 reporting grade ≥ 3 events: rash erythematous 
(grade 4, serious, considered possibly related to tabelecleucel by the investigator, and the subject 
recovered), tongue oedema (grade 3, nonserious, considered unrelated, in context of contrast 
administration for imaging investigation, and the subject was not recovered by the data lock point), and 
rash maculo-papular (grade 3, nonserious, considered an acute GvHD event and possibly related, and the 
subject recovered). There was 1 other serious event of rash not otherwise specified, which occurred in the 
subject reporting the rash erythematous which was grade 2, considered possibly related by the 
investigator, and the subject recovered by the time of the data lock point. In the other 2 clinical 
studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99), 1 subject reported a hypersensitivity TESAE of grade 2 periorbital 
oedema that was considered unrelated to tabelecleucel by the investigator, and the subject recovered from 
1 event and was not recovered from the other by the time of the data lock point.

SOT rejection events were reported in 1 of 40 (2.5%)1 subjects with EBV+ PTLD following SOT in 
Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 as described in the SOT rejection above.  
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing immunogenicity after tabelecleucel administration, however, patient- and disease-related 
factors may influence the development of an immune response and it would be expected that in the 
immunocompromised PTLD population, an immune response might be less likely to occur. 
Preventability: Appropriate monitoring of signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity are included in the 
product information as routine risk minimisation measures. Monitoring signs and symptoms of the 
clinical consequences of immunogenicity including events of lack of efficacy, or SOT rejection and early 
treatment is indicated as clinically appropriate as per institutional standards. 
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: No events of potential clinical manifestation of 
immunogenicity including lack of efficacy or severe events of hypersensitivity or SOT rejection were 
reported with the use of tabelecleucel in the clinical development programme.  
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a 
clinical setting under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals. As part of their 
posttransplant clinical management of PTLD, patients are closely monitored by experienced healthcare 
professionals and early detection and treatment of clinical manifestations of immunogenicity per 
institutional standards would be expected. Therefore, routine risk minimisation measures described in the 
product information are considered sufficient to manage this risk. It is expected that further data 
collection in the postmarketing setting via routine pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk 
is sufficiently managed through routine risk minimisation measures.  
Tabelecleucel provides meaningful benefit to an advanced oncology population with limited treatment 
options and rapidly compromised prognosis in the absence of treatment. Based on available data, the 
risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Transmission of infectious agents (including cytomegalovirus [CMV])  
Potential Mechanisms: Tabelecleucel is obtained from human donor blood cells and is manufactured 
using human- and animal-derived materials.  
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: The risk associated with tabelecleucel is considered very 
low. Strict precautions to prevent transmission of infectious agents and to ensure microbial safety of 
tabelecleucel are in place in compliance with principles of good manufacturing practices and regulatory 
guidelines.  
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched as follows: MedDRA PTs were searched 
for the term “transmission”; in addition, the investigator in the clinical studies or treating physician in the 
EAPs classified the event as transmission of infectious agents (including CMV), which was considered an 
adverse event of special interest (refer to Table 19 for a list of PTs). Treatment-emergent adverse events 
or TESAEs were defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 
30 days, inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a 
severity grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, 
moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20).

No cases of transmission of infectious agents have been reported after tabelecleucel administration in the 
clinical development programme1 as of the data lock point. In CMV-negative subjects who received 
tabelecleucel from a CMV-positive donor, no CMV seroconversions have been observed. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
transmission of infectious agents after tabelecleucel administration. 
Preventability: To minimise this risk, potential donors are screened and must test negative for relevant 
communicable disease agents and diseases, including HBV, HCV, and HIV to be donor-eligible. All 
tabelecleucel lots are tested to ensure no detection of adventitious agents, including CMV. The outcome 
of CMV testing will be communicated to prescribers.  
Monitoring for signs and symptoms are included in the product information as routine risk minimisation 
measures and early treatment is indicated as clinically appropriate per institutional standards. 
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: No cases of transmission of infectious agents 
(including CMV) were reported in Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201 and strength of 
evidence seems limited; however, further data will be collected in the postmarketing setting.  
Tabelecleucel is a medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription and is administered in a 
clinical setting under strict supervision of experienced healthcare professionals. As part of their 
posttransplant clinical management of PTLD, patients are closely monitored by experienced healthcare 
professionals and early detection and treatment of infections per institutional standards would be 
expected. Therefore, routine risk minimisation measures described in the product information are 
considered sufficient to manage this risk. It is expected that further data collection in the postmarketing 
setting via routine pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk is sufficiently managed through 
routine risk minimisation measures.  
Tabelecleucel provides meaningful benefit to an advanced oncology population with limited treatment 
options and rapidly compromised prognosis in the absence of treatment. Based on available data, the 
risk-benefit balance for tabelecleucel is considered and expected to remain favourable. 
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
Important Potential Risk: Decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product  
Potential Mechanisms: Tabelecleucel must be prepared and administered per specifications or there is a 
potential risk of decrease in viability of the product. The preparation and administration specifications 
address the factors that may affect cell viability including thaw rate, temperature (applies in both the 
frozen state and thawed state), time (applies in both the frozen state and thawed state), dilution level, 
diluent, gauge of needle to draw from vial, and gauge of intravenous catheter to administer. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: Based on potential inconsistencies that may arise due to 
product handling, decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product is considered an 
important potential risk.  
Characterisation of the Risk: The clinical database was searched for SMQ: medication error (narrow and 
broad) or SMQ: lack of efficacy (SMQ narrow). Treatment-emergent adverse events or TESAEs were 
defined as any AE or SAE that started on or after the first dose of tabelecleucel through 30 days, 
inclusive, after the last dose of tabelecleucel. The severity of each AE was determined using a severity 
grading system, which could have been either the CTCAE or categorical descriptions (mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death) and summarised by worst grade (Table 20). 
In Studies ATA129-EBV-302 and EBV-CTL-201, 1 of 103 subjects (1.0%)1 with EBV+ PTLD reported 
multiple-drug resistance which was flagged as lack of efficacy; however, this case was not related to a

decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product, and therefore, the case was 
excluded from this analysis.  
In the other 2 clinical studies (11-130 and 95-024; N = 99) and EAPs (ATA129-EAP-901 and 
ATA129-SPU; N = 138), no serious event resulting from a decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate 
handling of the product was reported. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: No risk groups or risk factors have been identified. 
Preventability: Adherence to routine risk minimisation measures in the product information, which 
includes the Healthcare Professional tear-off mitigate this risk.  
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product: There are no safety-related issues expected as 
potential consequences to this risk and lack of efficacy events are being closely monitored. Therefore, 
routine risk minimisation measures described in the product information are considered sufficient to 
manage this risk. It is expected that further data collection in the postmarketing setting via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities will confirm that this risk is sufficiently managed through routine risk 
minimisation measures.  
Public Health Impact: The public health impact is expected to be low. 
SVII.3.2. 
Presentation of the Missing Information 
Missing information: Use in paediatric population (Population between birth to < 18 years of age) 
Evidence source: A total of 340 subjects have been treated with tabelecleucel, 254 (74.7%) were 
≥ 18 years of age and 86 (25.3%) were < 18 years of age, as of the data lock point. Among the paediatric 
group, 3 (0.9%) were < 2, 20 (5.9%) were ≥ 2 to < 6, 31 (9.1%) were ≥ 6 to < 12, and 32 (9.4%) were 
≥ 12 to < 18 years of age. The available safety data in the paediatric population did not show differences 
in the safety profile compared to the adult safety data. Based on the ultra-rare disease indication, further 
safety data collection in the postmarketing setting is required.  
Population in need of further characterisation: There is a need to further define risks in the paediatric 
population to confirm the safety profile in this population, which was established based on a limited 
dataset as is expected in this ultra-rare disease indication. No additional risks or consequences are 
expected in this population based on the MOA and clinical safety data in 86 paediatric patients collected 
in the clinical development programme as of the data lock point.  
Missing information: Use in elderly population (Population ≥ 65 years of age) 
Evidence source: A total of 340 subjects have been treated with tabelecleucel, 288 (84.7%) were 
< 65 years of age and 52 (15.3%) were ≥ 65 years of age, as of the data lock point. Among the elderly 
group, 41 (12.1%) were ≥ 65 to < 75, 11 (3.2%) were ≥ 75 to < 85, and 0 were ≥ 85 years of age. The 
available safety data in the elderly did not show differences in the safety profile compared to the adult 
safety data. Based on the ultra-rare disease indication, further safety data collection in the postmarketing 
setting is required. 
Population in need of further characterisation: There is a need to further define risks in the elderly 
population to confirm the safety profile in this population, which was established based on a limited 
dataset as is expected in this ultra-rare disease indication. No additional risks or consequences are 
expected in this population based on the MOA and clinical safety data in 52 elderly patients collected in 
the clinical development programme as of the data lock point.  
Missing information: Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Evidence source: No information is available for tabelecleucel use in pregnant women as pregnant and 
breastfeeding women were excluded from the clinical studies. No animal reproductive and developmental

toxicity studies have been conducted with tabelecleucel. It is not known if tabelecleucel has the potential 
to be transferred to the foetus or can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
It is unknown whether tabelecleucel is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breastfeeding child.  
Population in need of further characterisation: There is a need to further define risks during pregnancy 
and lactation to better characterise the safety profile in this patient population; however, based on the 
proposed indication of an advanced oncology population with at least one prior therapy the occurrence of 
pregnancy is expected to be rare.  
Missing information: Long-term safety 
Evidence source: In Study ATA129-EBV-302, systematic safety data collection occurred through 2 years 
after first dose for events considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related. All subjects have a 
minimum of systematic safety data collection for 18 months and up to 23 months after last dose. No 
related events were reported beyond 2 months after last dose. Long-term reporting of at least possibly 
related AEs is required at any time per protocol. 
Population in need of further characterisation: Additional long-term safety data collection is required in 
the postmarketing setting to confirm the long-term safety profile in an ulta-rare indication. No additional 
long-term risks or consequences are expected since tabelecleucel is not genetically modified and 
consequently, the risk of cell transformation or malignancy is not expected. Additionally based on the 
partially matched allogenicity nature of tabelecleucel, no engraftment is expected. Tabelecleucel is an 
activated T cell which once administered is expected to target and specifically kill EBV+ target cells 
[Benoun 2021]. Once target cells are eliminated tabelecleucel is expected to be exhausted and not persist 
long-term.

PART VI.  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR EBVALLO 
(TABELECLEUCEL) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ebvallo. The RMP details important risks of 
Ebvallo, and how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Ebvallo’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ebvallo’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ebvallo should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ebvallo should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Ebvallo’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Ebvallo is authorised for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with 
relapsed or refractory Epstein-Barr virus-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease 
(EBV+ PTLD) who have received at least one prior therapy. For solid organ transplant patients, prior 
therapy includes chemotherapy unless chemotherapy is inappropriate (see SmPC for the full indication).  
Ebvallo contains tabelecleucel as the active substance and it is given by intravenous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ebvallo’s benefits can be found in Ebvallo’s EPAR, including 
in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the 
medicine's webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
II. 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Ebvallo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Ebvallo’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can include the following: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the SmPC and 
PL addressed to healthcare professionals and patients. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine's packaging. 
•  Ebvallo should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment 
of cancer. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Ebvallo are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Ebvallo. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

plausible mechanism of action and aggregate review of all TFR 
events, which include a case with positive rechallenge. 
The patients at risk of severe TFR are those with high tumour 
burden prior to treatment.a,b Depending on the anatomic location 
of the tumour or lymphadenopathy, complications may arise 
from mass effect including compression and/or obstruction of 
adjacent anatomic structures.

tabelecleucel clinical development programme as an adverse 
drug reaction based on a plausible mechanism of action. A causal 
relationship between tabelecleucel and GvHD cannot be 
excluded. As GvHD can be life-threatening or cause chronic 
comorbidities, it is considered an important identified risk. 
No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing GvHD after tabelecleucel administration.

Page 80 of 112 
SOT is limited, as the small number of reported cases of SOT 
rejection after administration of tabelecleucel had other risk 
factors including decrease of immunosuppressants as standard of 
care or a medical history of previous episodes of SOT rejection. 
As SOT rejection can be life-threatening or cause chronic 
comorbidities, it is considered an important potential risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing SOT rejection after tabelecleucel administration.

Important potential risk: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection 
Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine  There is no evidence of BMT rejection after administration of 
tabelecleucel in patients with previous allogeneic donor-derived 
HCT, as no cases have been reported in the clinical development 
programme. In addition, a diminished host immune system after 
HCT would unlikely facilitate immune reactions. As BMT 
rejection can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, 
it is considered an important potential risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing HCT graft after tabelecleucel administration.

Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine  Evidence for relationship of IRR with tabelecleucel is limited. As 
IRR can be life-threatening or cause chronic comorbidities, it is 
considered an important potential risk.

See Section II.C of this summary for an overview of the

Important potential risk: Immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine  HLA antibodies can potentially reduce the efficacy of 
tabelecleucel and can cause clinical manifestations of 
immunogenicity such as anaphylaxis and SOT rejection that may 
require medical intervention. No immunogenicity adverse events 
were specific to development of anti-HLA antibodies therefore, 
no definitive conclusions regarding the association of HLA 
antibody positivity with immunogenicity adverse events can be 
drawn, and hence, immunogenicity is an important potential risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors have been identified leading to increased risk of 
developing immunogenicity after tabelecleucel administration, 
however, patient- and disease-related factors may influence the 
development of an immune response and it would be expected 
that in the immunocompromised PTLD population, an immune 
response might be less likely to occur.

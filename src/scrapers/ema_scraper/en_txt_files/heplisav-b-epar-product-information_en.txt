CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
HEPLISAV B is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) caused 
by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults 18 years of age and older. 
The use of HEPLISAV B should be in accordance with official recommendations.  
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HEPLISAV B as 
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults: 
The vaccine is administrated intramuscularly.  
Primary vaccination:  
Adults: Two doses of 0.5 ml each: an initial dose followed by a second dose 1 month later. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adults with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 ml/min) including patients undergoing 
haemodialysis: Four doses of 0.5-ml each: an initial dose followed by a second dose 1 month later, a 
third dose 2 months after the initial dose, and a fourth dose 4 months after the initial dose. 
Booster dose 
The need for a booster dose has not been established. Subjects who are immunocompromised or who 
have chronic renal failure may require a booster dose. A 0.5-ml booster dose should be given when 
antibody levels decrease below recommended levels. See section 4.4. 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required. See section 5.1. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of HEPLISAV B in children less than 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
HEPLISAV B should be injected intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region. Injection into the gluteal 
region (buttocks) should be avoided. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine.  
Hypersensitivity to yeast. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
HEPLISAV B should not be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intradermally. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily 
available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.  
As with other vaccines, the administration of HEPLISAV B should be postponed in subjects suffering 
from acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, however, is not a contraindication 
for immunisation. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury. 
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. 
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised HBV infection to 
be present at the time of immunisation. HEPLISAV B may not prevent HBV infection in such cases.  
HEPLISAV B will not prevent infection caused by other pathogens known to infect the liver such as 
hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E viruses.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are very limited data on the immune response to HEPLISAV in individuals who did not mount a 
protective immune response to another hepatitis B vaccine. 
Immunodeficiency  
Immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to HEPLISAV B. There are 
very limited data available among immunocompromised population. Attention should be given to 
ensure that a protective antibody level is maintained as defined by national recommendations and 
guidelines. See section 4.2. 
Patients with chronic liver disease or with HIV infection or hepatitis C carriers should not be 
precluded from vaccination against hepatitis B. The vaccine could be advised since HBV infection can 
be severe in these patients: the HEPLISAV B vaccination should thus be considered on a case by case 
basis by the physician. 
Renal Impairment 
As patients with CKD who are pre-haemodialysis or receiving haemodialysis are particularly at risk of 
exposure to HBV and have a higher risk of becoming chronically infected, attention should be given to 
ensure that a protective antibody level is maintained as defined by national recommendations and 
guidelines. See section 4.2. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially 
'sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As there are no data on co-administration of HEPLISAV B with other vaccines, the concomitant use 
of HEPLISAV B with other vaccines is not recommended. 
Concomitant administration of HEPLISAV B with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) has not been 
studied. However, in circumstances where HEPLISAV B is administered with a standard dose of 
HBIG, these should be given at separate injection sites. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are a limited amount of data from the use of HEPLISAV B vaccine in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of relevance to humans with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of HEPLISAV B during pregnancy. 
Vaccination during pregnancy should only be performed if the risk-benefit ratio at the individual level 
outweighs possible risks for the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether HEPLISAV B is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from HEPLISAV B 
vaccination taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
vaccination for the woman. 
Fertility 
No data on the effect of HEPLISAV B on fertility in humans are available.   
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
HEPLISAV B may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machine. Some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” (e.g., malaise) may affect the ability to 
drive or operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile: 
The clinical trials safety profile is based on data from 9365 subjects followed in 3 pivotal studies.  
In two studies, 3777 of the 9365 subjects were monitored for local and systemic post-injection 
reactions using diary cards for a 7-day period starting on the day of vaccination. The most common 
adverse reactions seen were the post-injection reactions injection site pain, headache, malaise, fatigue, 
and myalgia. 
The reactogenicity profile of HEPLISAV B in 119 subjects on haemodialysis was generally 
comparable to that seen in healthy subjects.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions: 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows:  
Very common:  (≥1/10)  
Common:  (≥1/100 to <1/10)  
Uncommon:  (≥1/1000 to <1/100)  
Rare:  (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000)  
Very rare:  (<1/10,000) 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Vaccines, Viral Vaccines, Hepatitis Vaccine, ATC code:  J07BC01  
Mechanism of action 
HEPLISAV B is comprised of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen and the CpG 1018 adjuvant, 
which is a 22-mer PS-ODN immunostimulatory sequence. 
HEPLISAV B induces specific antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The biological actions of CpG 1018 are exerted locally at the injection site and draining lymph nodes. 
The adjuvant CpG 1018 component of HEPLISAV B has the following effects: (1) Activates 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) through the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 9; (2) 
converts pDCs into highly efficient antigen-presenting cells that present the processed HBsAg to 
CD4+ T cells; and, (3) promotes Th1 T-cell differentiation through the production of IFN-alpha and 
IL-12. This activation results in a high and sustained antibody response, likely due to the rapid 
generation of large numbers of anti-HBs-secreting plasmacytes and HBsAg-specific memory B and T 
cells.  
Immune responses to HEPLISAV B 
No efficacy trials were conducted due to the application of the well-established immune correlate of 
protection to the immune response (anti-HBs concentration ≥ 10 mIU/ml correlates with protection 
against HBV infection). The immunogenicity of HEPLISAV B was evaluated in 3 randomised, active 
controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre phase 3 clinical trials (HBV-10 with 3:1 randomisation, 
HBV-16 with 4:1 randomisation, and HBV-23 with 2:1 randomisation) including 9365 adults aged 
18 to 70 years given HEPLISAV B, and 3867 adults given the comparator hepatitis B vaccine 
(Engerix-B 20 mcg HBsAg). HEPLISAV B was given as a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 1 month and 
Engerix-B was given using a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1, and 6 months.   
Baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and 
body mass index (BMI). In the pooled analysis including all 3 trials, the mean age was 49.3 and 49.4 
in the HEPLISAV B arm and Engerix-B arms, respectively and there were 50.8% and 51.5% female 
participants who received HEPLISAV B and Engerix-B, respectively. 
The trials evaluated the seroprotection rates (SPR: percentage of vaccinated persons whose anti-HBs 
antibody levels were ≥ 10 mIU/ml after vaccination) after the second dose of HEPLISAV B compared 
to after the third dose of Engerix-B. The SPR and peak geometric mean concentration (GMC) after a 
2-dose schedule of HEPLISAV B were statistically significantly higher than after a 3-dose schedule of 
Engerix-B (lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs between 
HEPLISAV B and Engerix-B was greater than 0%; lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the 
ratio of GMCs between HEPLISAV B and Engerix-B was greater than 1.0) in all 3 trials (Table 1, 
Table 2).

Peak week for HEPLISAV B is Week 24. Peak week for Engerix-B is Week 28. 
SPR results were collected at each study visit in two of the pivotal trials, HBV-10 (week 4 to 28) and 
HBV-16 (week 4 to 52). HEPLISAV B induced significantly higher SPRs than Engerix-B across all 
study visits in both studies (Figure 1).

Haemodialysis 
In a phase 1, open-label, single arm, multicentre study of 119 adults with end-stage renal disease who 
were undergoing haemodialysis, participants received a 4-dose regimen of HEPLISAV B at 0, 1, 2, 
and 4 months. The mean age was 59.9 years and 60.5% were male, 39.5% were female.  
The primary analysis evaluated the SPR 5 months after the first dose of HEPLISAV B. In 
75 participants who received all 4 doses of HEPLISAV-B, the SPR was 89.3% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 80.1%, 95.3%). In secondary analyses, 81.3% (95% CI: 70.7%, 89.4%) of subjects had 
an anti-HBs concentration ≥100 mIU/mL. The geometric mean concentration of anti-HBs was 
1061.8 mIU/mL (95% CI: 547.2, 2060.2). 
In a phase 3, randomised, open-label, multicentre study of 116 adult subjects with 
haemodialysis-dependent CKD who were non-responders to previous hepatitis B vaccination, 
participants received a 1-dose booster regimen of HEPLISAV B or Fendrix, or a double booster dose 
of Engerix-B.  
Week 4 SPR in the HEPLISAV B group (42.1% n=16/38) was higher than the SPR in the Engerix-B 
group (18.9%, n=7/37) and the Fendrix group (29.3%, n=12/41). At Week 12, the SPR was 24.3% 
(n=9/37) in the HEPLISAV B group, 13.9% (n=5/36) in the Engerix-B group, and 26.8% (n=11/41) in 
the Fendrix group.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you.

- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse. This includes any

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What HEPLISAV B is and what it is used for 
HEPLISAV B is a vaccine for use in adults 18 years of age and older to protect against infection with 
the hepatitis B virus. 
HEPLISAV B may also protect against hepatitis D which can only occur in people who have hepatitis 
B infection. 
What is hepatitis B? 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hepatitis B is an infectious illness of the liver, caused by a virus. Hepatitis B virus infection can 
cause serious liver problems such as “cirrhosis” (scarring in the liver) or liver cancer. 
Some people infected with the hepatitis B virus become carriers, which means that they may not 
feel ill but continue to have the virus in their body and they can still infect other people. 
The disease spreads by the hepatitis B virus entering the body through contact with an infected 
person’s body fluids, such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva). A mother who is a 
carrier of the virus can also pass the virus to her baby at birth. 
The main signs of the illness include mild signs of flu (such as headache, fever, and feeling very 
tired), dark urine, pale stools (faeces), yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). However, 
some people with hepatitis B do not look or feel ill. 
How HEPLISAV B works 
When a person is given the HEPLISAV B vaccine, it helps the body’s natural defence system 
(immune system) produce specific protection (antibodies) against the hepatitis B virus.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
HEPLISAV B contains an adjuvant, a substance which improves the body’s production of 
antibodies and makes the protection last for longer. 
A course of two injections of HEPLISAV B is required to provide full protection against 
hepatitis B. 
HEPLISAV B is not used to treat a person who is already infected with the hepatitis B virus, 
including people infected with the hepatitis B virus and have become carriers for infection.  
2.  What you need to know before you receive HEPLISAV B  
Do not receive HEPLISAV B: 
- 
If you are allergic to any of the components of this vaccine, including yeast (listed in section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of 
the face or tongue. 
If you have had a sudden life-threatening, allergic reaction after receiving HEPLISAV B in the 
past. 
- 
HEPLISAV B should not be given if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse before vaccination with HEPLISAV B. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse before receiving HEPLISAV B: 
- 
- 
-  
If you have any allergies to any of the components of HEPLISAV B (see section 6). 
If you have had any health problems after having a vaccine in the past. 
Fainting can occur after, or even before, any injection. Therefore tell the doctor, <pharmacist> 
or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. 
If you are ill with a high fever, your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse will delay the vaccination 
until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your 
doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse will decide if you could still be vaccinated. 
- 
If you are on dialysis for a kidney problem or if you have a weakened immune system your doctor 
may need to do a blood test to check if the vaccination has worked well enough to protect you against 
hepatitis B. 
HEPLISAV B does not protect you against other liver infections such as hepatitis A, C, and E. 
As with any vaccine, HEPLISAV B may not protect all people who are vaccinated. 
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse before 
receiving HEPLISAV B. 
Children and adolescents 
Since HEPLISAV B has not been tested fully in young people under 18 years of age, it should not be 
used in this age group. 
Other medicines and HEPLISAV B 
Tell your doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. 
If HEPLISAV B is given at the same time as an injection of hepatitis B “immuno-globulins”, which 
would be given to provide immediate, short-term protection against hepatitis B infection, your doctor, 
<pharmacist> or nurse will make sure that the two are injected into different parts of the body. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before receiving this vaccine.  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of HEPLISAV B during pregnancy. 
It is unknown whether HEPLISAV B is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Discuss with your doctor or nurse if you should discontinue breast-feeding or abstain from 
HEPLISAV B vaccination, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the 
benefit of vaccination for you. 
Driving and using machines 
You may feel tired or get a headache after receiving HEPLISAV B. If this happens, do not drive or use 
any tools or machines.  
HEPLISAV B contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. 
3. 
How HEPLISAV B is given 
The doctor, <pharmacist> or nurse will give HEPLISAV B as an injection into your muscle, usually in 
your upper arm. 
For adults, the course of vaccination is 2 injections: 
- 
- 
The first injection on a date agreed upon with your doctor or nurse. 
The second injection 1 month after the first injection. 
For adults with a kidney problem including those receiving haemodialysis, the course of vaccination is 
4 injections: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The first injection on a date agreed upon with your doctor or nurse. 
The second injection 1 month after the first injection. 
The third injection 2 months after the first injection 
The fourth injection 4 months after the first injection 
Your doctor will tell you if you need any extra or “booster” injections in the future. 
If you forget a return visit to receive HEPLISAV B 
Talk to your doctor and arrange another visit. 
Make sure you complete the injections or you may not be fully protected. Once you have had the first 
injection of HEPLISAV B, the following injection(s) must also be HEPLISAV B (not another type of 
hepatitis B vaccine). 
4.

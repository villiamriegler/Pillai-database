1.  Introduction 
On 30th November 2021, the MAH submitted a completed study (Study No. HZA114971) for Relvar 
Ellipta and its duplicate Revinty Ellipta (fluticasone furoate / vilanterol trifenatate), in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
On 13th November 2013, Relvar Ellipta (Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol trifenatate Inhalation Powder 
[FF/VI]) was approved by the European Commission for "the regular treatment of asthma in adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist 
and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate", as well as for "the symptomatic treatment of adult patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)".  
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, the application included an EMA 
Decision on the granting of a class waiver for the condition COPD (EMA/825560/2008) and an EMA 
Decision on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), which included a waiver in children 
under 5 years of age and a deferral in children aged 5-11 years (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M04; 
P/0049/2012). According to the last EMA Decision (P/0092/2021), the agreed PIP for FF/VI (EMEA-
000431-PIP01-08-M12) is expected to be completed by October 2022. 
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to 
the EMA a final study report for study number HZA114971 which is part of the PIP EMEA-000431-
PIP01-08-M12 (Study 13). 
The MAH stated that the study HZA114971 “A Multicentre Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Effects of a One-Year Regimen of Orally Inhaled 
Fluticasone Furoate 50 mcg once daily on Growth Velocity in Prepubertal, Paediatric Subjects with 
Asthma” is a standalone study. As such, a line listing is not provided. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In the hereby submitted study, orally inhaled fluticasone furoate 50 micrograms (FF 50 mcg) or orally 
inhaled placebo (i.e., lactose) were administered once daily in prepubertal asthmatic children (aged 5 
to <9 years) on a background therapy of open-label montelukast. Both FF and placebo, were 
administered as dry inhalation powder by using the same inhaler device as the Relvar/Revinty products 
approved in the EU. 
The formulation of FF used in the study is not currently approved in the EU. The dose of FF (50 mcg) 
used in the study HZA114971 was selected from the 2b dose-ranging study HZA106855 of FF in 
children from 5 to less than 12 years of age with persistent asthma. Both studies are part of the PIP 
EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12 (see, PIP Study 8).

The formulations of montelukast used in the study were the same as the products approved in the EU 
for the treatment of persistent asthma as add-on therapy in children aged 2 to 5 years (4 mg chewable 
tablet) and aged 6 to 14 years (5 mg chewable tablet).  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study number HZA114971: “A Multicentre Randomised, Double-
Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Effects of a One-Year Regimen of Orally 
Inhaled Fluticasone Furoate 50 mcg once daily on Growth Velocity in Prepubertal, Paediatric Subjects 
with Asthma”. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number HZA114971: “A Multicentre Randomised, Double-
Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Effects of a 
One-Year Regimen of Orally Inhaled Fluticasone Furoate 50 mcg once daily 
on Growth Velocity in Prepubertal, Paediatric Subjects with Asthma”. 
Description 
HZA114971 was a randomised, single-blind (16-week placebo run-in period) / double-blind (52-week 
treatment period), parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre study to assess the effect of once 
daily (OD) orally inhaled fluticasone furoate (FF) 50 mcg on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic 
children on a background therapy of open-label montelukast (OD, 4 mg for subjects who are 5 years 
old and 5 mg for subjects who are ≥6 years old; from the run-in period through to the end of an 8-
week follow-up period).  
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the magnitude of effect (with a level of precision) of OD 
inhaled FF 50 mcg versus OD orally inhaled placebo on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic 
subjects (aged 5 to <9 years) over one year of treatment. 
Methods 
Objectives 
• 
Primary:  
To evaluate the magnitude of effect (with a level of precision) of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg versus orally 
inhaled placebo once daily on growth velocity in prepubertal children over one year of treatment. 
•  Secondary:  
To assess the safety of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg once daily.

To assess the effect of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg once daily on efficacy endpoints, used as a measure of 
compliance to help identify nonadherence and/or poorly controlled asthma. 
Study design 
This was a randomised, single-blind (run-in period) / double-blind (treatment period), parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the effect of FF 50 mcg once daily on growth velocity in 
prepubertal asthmatic children on a background therapy of open-label montelukast. Study 
randomisation was stratified by country to account for possible differences in medical practices and 
growth velocity across countries. 
This study was conducted over a total duration of approximately 76 weeks: a 16-week run-in period; 
52-week double-blind treatment period; and 8-week follow-up period. 
Eligible participants received a single-blind placebo orally inhaler during a 16-week run-in period. After 
completing the run-in period, eligible participants were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive orally 
inhaled FF 50 mcg or orally inhaled placebo for 52 weeks.

In addition, albuterol/salbutamol (inhalation aerosol or nebuliser) use was to be withheld for 4 
hours prior to the FEV1 measurement at Screening. 
Sample size 
The proposed sample size for this study was based on FDA guidance [Guidance for Industry Orally 
Inhaled and Intranasal Corticosteroids: Evaluation of the Effects on Growth in Children, 2007]. 
The study was not powered to detect any treatment differences. The study was designed to provide 
the estimated mean treatment difference between orally inhaled FF 50 mcg once daily (plus 
montelukast open-label) and orally inhaled placebo (plus montelukast open-label) in prepubescent 
growth velocities, with a certain degree of precision on the 95% CI. The primary population for growth 
analyses was the Growth Population. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to estimate 
the mean treatment difference in growth velocities over the double-blind treatment period, adjusting 
for baseline growth velocity, age at Screening visit (Visit 1), gender, and country. A 95% CI was also 
provided for the estimated mean treatment difference in growth velocity over the double-blind 
treatment period. 
Eligible participants were stratified by country and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to orally inhaled FF 50 
mcg once daily (plus montelukast open-label) or orally inhaled placebo (plus montelukast open-label). 
At least 450 participants were to be randomised (approximately 225 per treatment arm). Assuming a 
withdrawal rate from study treatment of up to 10% within the first 12 weeks, this would still ensure at 
least 406 eligible participants (approximately 203 per treatment arm) for inclusion in the Growth 
Population analyses. Assuming a standard deviation (SD) for the growth velocities of 1.2 cm/yr (based

on study FFR101782 to evaluate the effects of a one-year course of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 
mcg QD on growth in pre-pubescent pediatric subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis), a sample size of 
203 eligible participants per treatment arm ensured the width of the CI for the mean treatment 
difference was no greater than 0.5 cm/yr. 
Sample Size Sensitivity 
To demonstrate the sensitivity of the sample size calculation for this study, the following table presents 
the precision of the two-sided 95% CI for the estimated mean treatment difference on growth 
velocities under different circumstances in terms of SD and the number of participants per treatment 
group for the growth analyses. 
The shaded area represents the number of participants per treatment group and the SD that 
correspond to a 95% CI with a width no greater than 0.5 cm/yr. 
Sample size re-estimation or adjustment was not planned. 
Treatments 
The term ‘study treatment’ is used throughout the clinical study report (CSR) to describe any 
combination of products received by the participant as per the protocol design. Study treatment may 
therefore refer to the individual study treatments or combination of those study treatments.

Each participant also received an albuterol/salbutamol (inhalation aerosol or nebuliser) to be used as 
needed throughout the entire study period as rescue medication for symptomatic relief of asthma 
symptoms. Montelukast was locally sourced by the sites.

Statistical Methods 
Three participant populations were defined:  
• 
• 
Total Population: The Total Population comprised all participants screened and for whom a 
record exists on the study database and was used for the tabulation and listing of reasons for 
withdrawal before randomisation (Visit 5).  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT Population was defined as all randomised participants 
who received at least one dose of study treatment. All safety and efficacy (compliance 
assessments) data analyses used the ITT Population.  
•  Growth Population: The Growth Population was defined as all ITT participants with height 
assessments via stadiometry from at least three post-randomisation, on-treatment clinic visits 
during the double-blind treatment period. This was the primary population for analyses of 
growth data.  
The following subgroups were used in descriptive summaries and/or statistical analyses of growth 
velocity. 
No interim analyses are planned during this study.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study was conducted at 67 sites in 6 countries. The study was initiated on 20 October 2016 (first 
participant first visit) and completed on 04 June 2021 (last participant last visit).  
A total of 874 participants were screened. Of these, 644 entered the run-in period. One participant 
experienced an SAE during the run-in period and was considered a run-in failure; this participant was 
not randomised and did not receive any study treatment.  
Following the run-in period, a total of 477 participants who met the randomisation criteria were 
randomised to receive study treatment. A total of 477 (100% of participants randomised) participants 
were included in the ITT Population and 457 (96% of participants in ITT Population) were included in 
the Growth Population.  
Figure 2. Participant Disposition 
Source: Table 1.1, Table 1.2, Table 1.4, Table 1.9, Table 1.10  
Total: All participants screened and for whom a record exists in the study database.  
Intent-to-Treat: All randomised participants who received at least a single dose of study treatment.  
Growth: All ITT participants with height assessments via stadiometry from at least three post-randomisation, on-treatment clinic 
visits during the double-blind treatment period.  
Notes: Screen failures were participants who failed screening and withdrew at Visit 1 (Screening). Run-in failures were withdrawals 
after Visit 1 (Screening) and prior to randomization. 1 Participant did not meet continuation criteria but was recorded on the 
disposition form with "investigator discretion" as reason for run-in failure and so was counted under "investigator discretion". 
Participants may have more than one run-in failure reason specified. Participants were prematurely withdrawn from the study before 
completing Visit 18, but the early treatment discontinuation form wasn't filled. These participants are not considered as prematurely 
discontinuing study treatment. 
In total, 401 participants completed the study; the proportion of participants who completed the study 
was slightly lower for the placebo group (82% for the placebo group and 86% for the FF 50 group). A

b Participants were from the 3 sites closed prematurely due to suspected ICH GCP noncompliance (see Section 5.2.3). 
Baseline data 
The two treatment groups were similar with respect to age, race, ethnicity, medical conditions, asthma 
history, and lung function. 
All participants were children between the ages of 4 and 9 years (age was calculated approximately, as 
date of birth was imputed), and the mean (±SD) age between groups was similar, 6.1 (1.07) for the 
placebo group and 6.3 (1.02) for the FF 50 group. The majority of the participants were White 
(412/477 [86%]) and male (299/477 [63%]). The mean BMI of participants was similar between 
treatment groups, 16.36 (1.70) for the placebo group and 16.52 (1.73) for the FF 50 group. 
Demographic characteristics were similar between the ITT Population and the Growth Population. 
All participants had asthma, per the enrolment criteria for the study, and this was reported as a 
current condition. In addition to asthma, the most commonly reported current medical condition was 
nasal disorder (216/477 [45%] participants), followed by eczema (72/477 [15%] participants). There 
were 99/477 (21%) participants who reported past medical conditions, being the most commonly 
reported past medical condition was pneumonia in 40/477 (8%) participants, which was followed by 
eczema in 30/477 (6%) participants. One participant in the FF 50 group reported arrhythmia as a past 
medical condition. 
The mean (±SD) duration of asthma was 3 (±1.85) years, and was similar for both groups. The 
majority of participants had an asthma duration ranging from ≥1 year to <5 years. The distribution of 
asthma duration was similar between the treatment groups. 
Lung function parameters at Screening (FEV1, predicted FEV1, and percent predicted FEV1) were 
similar for both groups.

mean (±SD) change from baseline was similar for both treatment groups, 0.9 (2.83) for the placebo 
group and 0.7 (3.64) for the FF 50 group (Table 8). One participant had a protocol deviation at 
Screening, and 7 participants had protocol deviations for the period from inclusion to run-in for a cACT 
score >19.

Safety results 
A total of 239 participants in the placebo group and 238 participants in the FF 50 group received at 
least 1 dose of study treatment. Study treatment exposure was slightly higher for the FF 50 group. The 
mean (±SD) number of days of exposure was 334.5 (77.46) for the placebo group and 344.0 (61.38) 
for the FF 50 group indicating that the majority of participants completed approximately one year of 
treatment. The median (minimum-maximum) number of days of exposure was 364 (4-386) days for 
the placebo group and 364 (30-386) days for the FF 50 group. 
Growth Velocity 
• 
Primary Endpoints of Growth Velocity 
The study primary endpoint was growth velocity (cm/yr) over the double-blind treatment period, as 
determined by stadiometry for the Growth Population.  
Baseline mean (SD) growth velocity was similar between the two treatment groups (5.839 [1.398] 
cm/yr for the placebo group and 5.801 [1.263] cm/yr for the FF 50 group). During treatment, the least 
squares (LS) mean growth velocity was 6.065 cm/yr for the placebo group (n=226) and 5.905 cm/yr 
for the FF 50 group (n=231); the LS mean difference (MD) in growth velocity was ─0.160 cm/yr, (95% 
CI -0.462, 0.142).  
The relationship between the baseline period growth velocity and treatment period growth velocity for 
each participant is illustrated below by a scatter plot of growth velocity during the treatment period for 
the Growth Population (Figure 3.a) and for the ITT Population (Figure 3.b). The relationship was similar 
for both placebo and FF 50, and the velocity was similar when looking at baseline and the treatment 
period.

Using only on-treatment height data, the LS mean growth velocity was 6.118 cm/yr for the placebo 
group and 5.896 cm/yr for the FF 50 group, similar to the primary analysis; the LS MD in growth 
velocity was -0.222 cm/yr, 95% CI (-0.528, 0.084). 
Growth Velocity Supportive Analyses  
Additional supportive analyses were also conducted for the primary endpoint. Statistical analyses 
showed that the treatment differences on LS mean growth velocities for all of these supportive 
analyses ranged from -0.027 to -0.357 cm/yr (Table 10) and the results were generally consistent with 
the primary analysis. The LS MD from each supportive analysis was contained within the bounds of the 
upper and lower limits of the 95% CI for the primary analysis [-0.160 cm/yr, 95% CI (-0.462, 0.142)].

Intercurrent Events  
For the ITT Population the percentage of participants with an intercurrent event of rescue systemic 
corticosteroid use was 10% (25/239) and 7% (16/238) for the placebo and the FF 50 groups, 
respectively. Similar percentages, 11% (25/226) for the placebo group and 7% (16/231) for the FF 50 
group), were seen for the Growth Population for this intercurrent event.  
For the intercurrent event of rescue inhaled/intranasal corticosteroids use, the percentage of 
participants with this intercurrent event were 12% (28/239) and 12% (29/238) for the placebo and the 
FF 50 groups, respectively for the ITT Population. Similar percentages, 12% (27/226) for the placebo 
group and 12% (28/231) for the FF 50 group), were seen for the Growth Population. 
•  Secondary Endpoints of Growth Velocity 
The Standard Deviation Scores (SDSs) for height showed normal growth in both treatment groups 
(see, Figure 5). For a given visit during the study, the distributions of SDS were similar between the 
two treatment groups. 
Figure 5. Height Standard Deviation Scores (Growth Population) 
Source: Figure 2.1 Abbreviations: EOT=early treatment discontinuation; EOS=early withdrawal from study 
The change from baseline in height SDS was within expected variations over the course of one year, 
and was similar for both treatment groups (-0.02 for the placebo group and -0.04 for the FF 50 group). 
The two groups were similar regarding percent of participants below the 3rd percentile of growth 
velocity, 9% (20/226) in the placebo group and 7% (16/231) in the FF 50 group. 
Increases from baseline to endpoint (last 12 weeks on double-blind treatment) in growth velocity 
quartile occurred in a similar number of participants in the placebo (74/226, 33%) and FF 50 (73/231,

32%) groups; decreases in growth velocity quartile were more common in participants in the FF 50 
group (88/231, 38%) than the placebo group (76/226, 34%). 
Over the first 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, the LS mean (SD) growth velocity was 6.222 
(0.185) cm/yr  and 6.281 (0.184) cm/yr for the placebo and FF 50 groups, respectively; for the FF 50 
group the LS MD in growth velocity was 0.059 cm/yr, with 95% CI (-0.455, 0.572). 
•  Subgroup Analyses of Growth Velocity 
Since the number of participants is not balanced between the regional subgroups (US vs non-US) and 
the number of participants in one of the subgroups is small, caution should be taken when interpreting 
the results. 
In the US region, the LS mean (SD) was 5.796 (0.243) for the placebo group and 6.055 (0.240) for 
the FF 50 group; the LS MD for the FF 50 group (95% CI) was 0.259 (-0.419, 0.938). For the non-US 
region, the LS mean (SD) was 6.180 (0.114) for the placebo group and 5.842 (0.113) for the FF 50 
group; the LS MD (95% CI) was -0.338 (-0.654, -0.022).

A random coefficient analysis was performed to support the primary analysis findings using an ANCOVA 
model with height as the dependent variable, and baseline height, age, gender, treatment, time, and 
treatment-by-time interaction as explanatory variables in the mixed effect model with random 
intercept and slope. The results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with those of the primary 
analysis; the estimated mean (SD) growth velocities were 6.111 (0.110) cm/yr and 5.881 (0.108) 
cm/yr for placebo and FF 50, respectively, with a treatment difference of -0.230 cm/yr and 95% CI (-
0.533, 0.074). 
Adverse Events  
An overview of AEs by number of events during pre-treatment and on-treatment is presented in Table 
13. For both treatment groups, the overall rate of pre-treatment and on-treatment AEs were 33% and 
57%, respectively. The majority of the AEs reported were of mild or moderate intensity. A single drug-
related AE was reported in the FF 50 group. One participant in each group had an SAE; neither was 
considered to be related to study treatment. Please note that there may be minor discrepancies in the 
details of the SAEs included in the clinical narratives compared with the safety tabulations. This is 
because the data come from 2 different databases (i.e., locked clinical trials database and dynamic 
SAE database) and have been collected at different points in time.

During the pre-treatment period, 78/239 (33%) participants in the placebo group and 79/238 (33%) 
participants in the FF 50 group experienced one or more AEs. The overall incidence of AEs on-
treatment was 57% for the placebo and FF 50 groups (Table 14). The most frequently reported AEs 
occurred in the infections and infestations SOC (45% placebo; 47% FF 50). For both treatment groups, 
the most frequently reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis and 
influenza.  
One participant in the FF 50 group experienced one or more AEs that led to withdrawal from the study. 
The incidence of AEs during the follow-up period was similar for the placebo and FF 50 groups (35/239 
[15%] and 43/238 [18%] participants, respectively). Overall, during the study period 2/238 (<1%) 
participants in the FF 50 group experienced one or more AEs that were considered treatment-related 
by the investigator (Table 15).

•  Drug-Related Adverse Events  
Two (<1%) participants in the FF 50 group were reported with drug-related AEs that included 
abdominal pain, constipation, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and decreased appetite (more than 1 AE was 
reported per participant) (Table 15). All of the drug-related AEs were reported as non-serious.

similar between treatment groups (44% [105/239] in the placebo group and 42% [99/238] in the FF 
50 group). The most commonly reported PTs were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, 
rhinitis, and pyrexia (Table 16). A summary of common (occurring in ≥3% of participants in any 
treatment group) non-serious on-treatment AEs by number of participants and occurrences during 
treatment is presented in Table 16.

•  Adverse Events and COVID-19 Pandemic  
The two treatment groups were similar with respect to AEs and SAEs for the pre-pandemic and during 
pandemic periods. 
Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events  
SAEs were reported for 6/239 (3%) participants in the placebo group and 4/238 (2%) participants in 
the FF 50 group. None of the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment 
and no dose relationship or pattern of events was observed. See, case narratives. 
•  Deaths  
No participants died during the study. 
•  Other Serious Adverse Events  
Pre-treatment SAEs were reported for 1 participant in each treatment group. The participant in the 
placebo group had an SAE of fracture, and the participant in the FF 50 group had an SAE of tonsilitis. 
Post-treatment SAEs were reported for 1 participant in each treatment group. The participant in the 
placebo group had an SAE of asthma, and the participant in the FF 50 group had an SAE of bronchitis. 
•  Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events  
There were no drug-related SAEs reported during the study. 
•  Other Significant Adverse Events  
One participant in the FF 50 group reported an AE of asthma deterioration leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study. The participant was an 8-year-old 
white boy with asthma deterioration reported 206 days after the first dose of study treatment, with a

duration of 12 days. The participant was withdrawn from study treatment, the outcome was 
recovered/resolved, and the event was considered by the investigator as not related to study 
treatment. 
Overall, there were 45/239 (19%) participants in the placebo group and 44/238 (18%) participants in 
the FF 50 group with Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) during the study. The most frequently 
reported AESI for both groups was bronchitis (15/239 [6%] participants in the placebo group and 
12/238 [5%] in the FF 50 group), followed by allergic rhinitis (12/239 [5%] participants in the placebo 
group and 9/238 [4%] in the FF 50 group).  
Two serious AESIs were reported in each of the treatment groups, during and after treatment. The 
reported serious AESIs in the placebo group were pneumonia and diabetes mellitus, whereas the 
serious AESIs reported in the FF 50 group were pneumonia and bronchitis. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
There were no protocol-mandated clinical laboratory evaluations performed during this study. 
Asthma Exacerbations 
During the treatment period, more participants in the placebo group (22/239 participants, 9%) than in 
the FF 50 group (7/238 participants, 3%) experienced at least one asthma exacerbation (Table 17). 
This difference is evidence of treatment compliance by participants in the FF 50 group. 
One participant in each treatment group permanently discontinued study treatment due to an 
exacerbation. More participants in the placebo group reported that they took systemic/oral 
corticosteroids for an exacerbation than in the FF 50 group (22/239 [9%] and 7/238 [3%] participants, 
respectively). More participants in the placebo group were hospitalised due to an exacerbation, and 
visited the emergency room due to an exacerbation. After the treatment period, the two treatment 
groups were similar with respect to asthma exacerbations.

Pneumonia 
Two (<1%) participants in the placebo group (n=239) and 3 (1%) participants in the FF50 group 
(n=238) reported pneumonia while on treatment. Post-treatment, 1 (<1%) participant in each group 
reported pneumonia.  
For the two participants in the placebo group, one participant was a 5-year-old white girl with 
pneumonia reported 239 days after the first dose of study treatment, with a duration of 11 days. Study 
treatment was not changed, the outcome was recovered/resolved, and the event was considered by 
the investigator as not related to study treatment. The other participant was a 5-year-old white boy 
with pneumonia reported 195 days after the first dose of study treatment, with a duration of 15 days. 
Study treatment was not changed, the outcome was recovered/resolved, and the event was considered 
by the investigator as not related to study treatment. For the three participants in the FF 50 group, the 
first was a 7-year-old white girl reported with mycoplasmal pneumonia 32 days after the first dose of 
study treatment, with a duration of 24 days. Study treatment was not changed, the outcome was 
recovered/resolved, and the event was considered by the investigator as not related to study 
treatment. The second participant as a 7-year-old white girl reported with pneumonia 181 days after 
the first dose of study treatment, with a duration of 8 days. Study treatment was not changed, the 
outcome was recovered/resolved, and the event was considered by the investigator as not related to

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, concerns the submission of a stand-alone 
study, which is the HZA114971 study: “A Multicentre Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 
Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Effects of a One-Year Regimen of Orally Inhaled Fluticasone 
Furoate 50 mcg once daily on Growth Velocity in Prepubertal, Paediatric Subjects with Asthma”. Study 
HZA114971 is part of the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate 
inhalation powder (FF/VI) agreed upon for the treatment of asthma indication (EMEA-000431-PIP01-
08-M12; see, PIP Study 13). 
FF/VI is currently approved by the European Commission for the regular treatment of asthma in adults 
and adolescents aged 12 years and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-
agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate. 
HZA114971 was a randomised, single-blind (placebo run-in period) / double-blind (treatment period), 
parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre study to assess the effect of once daily (OD) orally 
inhaled FF 50 mcg on growth velocity in prepubertal (Tanner Stage 1) asthmatic children aged 5 to <9 
years on a background therapy of open-label montelukast. After completing a 16-week placebo run-in 
period, eligible subjects were randomised (1:1) to receive placebo or FF 50 mcg during a 52-week 
period. All participants received open-label montelukast (OD, 4 mg for subjects who are 5 years old 
and 5 mg for subjects who are ≥6 years old) as chewable tablets throughout the entire study period 
(76 weeks: 16-week run-in period; 52-week double-blind treatment period; and 8-week follow-up 
period). Albuterol/salbutamol (inhalation aerosol or nebuliser) was received as rescue medication from 
the run-in period through to the end of an 8-week follow-up period.   
The primary objective was to evaluate the magnitude of effect (with a level of precision) of orally 
inhaled FF 50 mcg versus orally inhaled placebo on growth velocity in prepubertal children over one 
year of treatment. The primary endpoint, growth velocity, was determined by stadiometry over the 
double blind treatment period. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects below the 3rd 
percentile of growth velocity, the change in growth velocity quartiles from baseline to endpoint, growth 
velocity over the first 12 weeks of double-blind treatment period and height standard deviation scores 
(SDS) at each visit. The primary population for the primary growth analysis was the Growth 
Population, which only includes randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment 
(ITT population) with height assessments from at least three post-randomisation, on-treatment clinic 
visits during the double-blind treatment period. The submitted study methodology appears adequate 
for its primary objective. 
Safety of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg OD was also determined by measuring the incidence of adverse 
events and asthma exacerbations. The assessment of the effect of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg OD on 
some efficacy endpoints (PEF and asthma symptoms), were used as a measure of compliance to help 
identify nonadherence and/or poorly controlled asthma. All safety and efficacy (compliance 
assessments) data analyses used the ITT Population. 
239 subjects in the placebo group and 238 subjects in the FF 50 group out of the 874 screened 
participants entered the run-in period, but only 477 of them met the randomisation criteria to be

randomised to receive study treatment. All 477 randomised participants were included in the ITT 
Population (239 subjects in the placebo group and 238 subjects in the FF 50 group) and 457/477 
participants (96% of participants in ITT Population) were included in the Growth Population (226 
subjects in the placebo group and 231 subjects in the FF 50 group). The number of screened and 
randomised subjects as well as the number of subjects per treatment arm, are in agreement with the 
planned sample size. 
The two treatment groups were similar with respect to age, race, ethnicity, medical conditions, asthma 
history, and lung function. All participants were children between the ages of 4 and 9 years, and the 
mean (±SD) age between groups was similar, 6.1 (1.07) for the placebo group (n=239) and 6.3 (1.02) 
for the FF 50 group (n=238). The majority of the participants were White (412/477 [86%]) and male 
(299/477 [63%]). The mean BMI of participants was similar between treatment groups, 16.36 (1.70) 
for the placebo group and 16.52 (1.73) for the FF 50 group.  
Study treatment exposure was slightly higher for the FF 50 group (344.0 mean days of exposure for 
the placebo group and 334.5 for the FF 50 group). 
Baseline mean growth velocity was similar between the two treatment groups (5.839 cm/yr for placebo  
[n=226] and 5.801 cm/yr for FF 50 [n=231]). During treatment, the least-squares (LS) mean growth 
velocity was 6.065 cm/yr for the placebo group and 5.905 cm/yr for the FF 50 group. The LS mean 
treatment difference for FF 50 versus placebo from the primary analysis was -0.160 cm/yr (95% CI: -
0.462, 0.142). The effect on growth after one year did not result in any clinically meaningful drop in 
height Standard Deviation Scores (SDS) with a mean change from baseline of -0.04 SDS in the FF 
group and -0.02 SDS in the placebo group. Obtained growth data could suggest that children were still 
growing along the same centile. 
The overall rate of on-treatment adverse events (AEs) was 57% for both treatment groups (136/239 in 
the placebo group and 136/238 in the FF 50 group). The majority of the AEs reported were of mild or 
moderate intensity. One participant in each group had an SAE. One participant in the FF 50 group 
experienced AEs that led to withdrawal from the study, the outcome was recovered/resolved, and the 
event was considered by the investigator as not related to study treatment. During the study period, 
2/238 participants in the FF 50 group experienced one or more drug-related AEs considered as non-
serious by the investigator. There were no deaths and no drug-related SAEs reported. Overall, it is 
considered that no safety signals have been emerged from the study findings. 
There were no clear differences between the two groups regarding their measures of compliance. This 
may be explained by the relatively mild asthma in the children recruited in the study and in part at 
least by the background montelukast in both groups. 
Assuming that the study was not powered to detect any treatment differences, the obtained results 
suggests that, compared with placebo, a one-year regimen of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg had no effect 
on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic children aged 5 to <9 years on a background therapy of 
open-label montelukas.  
Since the provided results for FF 50 mcg are in line with the approved product information in the EU for 
FF/VI formulations (100/25 mcg and 200/25 mcg), no regulatory action required at this point.

3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, the MAH submitted a final study report 
for study number HZA114971 “A Multicentre Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-
Group Study to Evaluate the Effects of a One-Year Regimen of Orally Inhaled Fluticasone Furoate 50 
mcg once daily on Growth Velocity in Prepubertal, Paediatric Subjects with Asthma”. This study is part 
of the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate inhalation powder 
(FF/VI) agreed upon for the treatment of asthma indication (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12). 
HZA114971 was a randomised, single-blind (placebo run-in period) / double-blind (treatment period), 
parallel group, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the effect of once-daily orally inhaled FF 
50 mcg on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic children aged 5 to <9 years on a background 
therapy of open-label montelukast. 
Assuming that the study was not powered to detect any treatment differences, the obtained results 
suggests that, compared with placebo, a one-year regimen of orally inhaled FF 50 mcg had no effect 
on growth velocity in prepubertal asthmatic children aged 5 to <9 years on a background therapy of 
open-label montelukast.  
Since the provided results for FF 50 mcg are in line with the approved product information in the EU for 
FF/VI formulations (100/25 mcg and 200/25 mcg), no regulatory action is required at this point.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

Lenalidomide  [3-(4’-amino-1,3-dihydro-1-oxo-2H-isoindol-2y1)-2-6-piperidinedione] 
is  an  immunomodulatory  agent  and  belongs  to a  class  of  drugs  known  as  IMiD. The 
mechanism of action of lenalidomide includes direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory 
effects.  Specifically,  lenalidomide  inhibits  proliferation  of  certain  haematopoietic 
tumour  cells  (including  MM  plasma  tumour  cells,  FL  tumour  cells  and  those  with 
deletions  of  chromosome  5),  enhances  T-cell- and  NK  cell-mediated  immunity  and 
increases  the  number  of  NK,  T  and  NK  T  cells.  In  MDS  associated  with  a  del  5q 
cytogenetic  abnormality,  lenalidomide  selectively  inhibits  the  abnormal  clone  by 
increasing the apoptosis of del 5q cells. The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab 
increases  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  and  direct  tumour  apoptosis  in  FL 
cells.
The  lenalidomide  mechanism  of  action  also  includes  additional  activities  such  as 
anti-angiogenic  and pro-erythropoietic  properties.  Lenalidomide  inhibits angiogenesis 
by  blocking  the  migration  and  adhesion  of  endothelial  cells  and  the  formation  of 
microvessels,  augments  foetal  haemoglobin  production  by  cells  expressing  CD34+ 
haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro inflammatory cytokines (eg, 
tumour necrosis factor alpha and IL-6) by monocytes.
Direct tumour  cytotoxic  effects  of  lenalidomide have  also  been  shown  to result  from 
actin  polymerisation  and  relocalisation  of  membrane  proteins  leading  to  cytoskeletal 
reorganisation,  cell  cycle  arrest,  and  alterations  in  gene  expression.  The  cytoskeletal 
effects  play  a  key  role  in  the  restoration  of  a  defective  immune  synapse  in  MCL.  In 
MCL, lenalidomide treatment induced formation of F-actin and polarisation of F-actin-
rich structures to the plasma membrane within minutes and induced the polarisation of 
antigen-presenting proteins, such as CD1c, and the increase of co-stimulatory molecules, 
such as CD54.

Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
2.1.1
Follicular Lymphoma
The incidence, prevalence, mortality, and demographics of the population of patients with FL are 
summarised in Table 2.1.1-1.
Table 2.1.1-1:
Epidemiologic Characteristics of Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular Lymphoma
Incidence and 
Prevalence

FL is the second most common form of indolent lymphoma in the US and Europe,
and accounts for about 10% to 20% of NHL.1

 Age-adjusted  incidence rate  of  FL  in  the  US  was  3.4  per  100,000  person-years
from 2011 to 2012, and estimated new cases of FL  was 13,960 in 2016.2 In the
UK, the crude incidence rate from the HMRN from 2004 to 2012 was 3.23% (95%
CI: 3.03-3.45) per 100,000; age-standardised (European 2013) incidence rate was
2.81 (95% CI: 2.74-2.88) per 100,000.3
The  3-,  5-,  and  10-year  prevalence  rates  per  100,000  estimated  from  the  UK
HMRN database were 9.7 (95% CI: 8.7-10.7), 14.8 (95% CI: 13.6-16.1), and 25.2
(95% CI: 23.5-26.9) respectively.3
The  median  age  at  diagnosis  is  60  to  65  years,  and  there  is  a  slight  female
predominance.  In  the  US,  African-Americans  have  a  higher  incidence  than
Caucasians.4
In the UK HMRN population, median age at diagnosis was 64.9 (IQR 55.8-73.3).3
Similarly,  in the  EUROCARE  study,  the median age  at  diagnosis  was  62  years
(IQR 51 to 72) and females accounted for 53% of all 13,988 cases.5


 Risk factors for FL are poorly understood. Other than age, gender and ethnicity,
environmental  and  occupational  exposure to  benzenes and pesticides  have  been
implicated, but a clear association has not been established. Lifestyle factors such
as smoking, alcohol use, and obesity have also been implicated in various studies,
but conflicting results have not established a clear association with increased risk
of FL.4
 Genetic  risk  factors  include  variants  at  the  6p21.32  region  of  the  Major
Histocompatibility  Complex  II  locus,  polymorphisms  of  the  DNA  repair  gene
XRCC3, and ultraviolet exposure in individuals with certain polymorphisms of the
vitamin D receptor.6
 Risk factors for transformation to DLBCL have been controversial. Clinical risk
factors  include  elevated  β2-microglobulin  levels,  high  international  prognostic
index, high FLIPI score, and advanced stage (III and IV). Some studies suggest
that  time  and  treatment  approach  (watch  and  wait  as  first-\line  therapy  versus
treatment with rituximab) are possible risk factors for transformation. However,
due to the variable follow-up time, inclusion criteria and treatments, findings in
various studies have been inconsistent.1
Treatment options are currently recommended for patients with FL by the ESMO7
and NCCN.8


In  the  EU,  approved  first-line  treatment  options  include  rituximab,  interferon
alpha, Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, bendamustine, and obinutuzumab.
 At  relapse,  the  selection  of  salvage  treatment  depends  on  the  patient’s  prior
regimens. In symptomatic cases with low tumour burden, rituximab monotherapy
may be utilized. In early relapses, (< 12 to 24 months), consideration should be
given to a non-cross resistant therapy, such as CHOP followed by bendamustine.
Fludararabine, platinum or alkylator based regimens are other treatment options.
Rituximab may be added if the previous antibody containing regimen achieved a
duration  of  remission  > 6  to  12  months.  In  rituximab  refractory  cases,
obinutuzumab may be used. In patients with short lived remissions (< 2 to 3 years),
high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT, should be considered. In late relapses,
monotherapy  is  considered  palliative  treatment,  eg  idelalisib.  Other  subsequent
treatment options recommended by the NCCN include idelalisib and copanilisib,
as well as the following regimens: cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone
with obinutuzumab or rituximab, and lenalidomide with or without rituximab. For
elderly  patients  whose  treatment  options  may  be  limited  by  comorbidities,
radioimmunotherapy (Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan) may be an effective treatment
option. Additional treatment options recommended by the NCCN for the elderly
patient population include R-CHOP; R-CVP; and bendamustine and rituximab.
Mortality and morbidity 
(natural history)

The  natural  history  of  FL  is  indolent  in  nature,  with  most  patients  developing
several relapses over their lifetime. As the disease progresses, subsequent relapses
can  become  progressively  aggressive  and  refractory,  and  some  cases  may
transform into aggressive lymphoma.9
 According to the WHO criteria, FL tumours are histologically divided into three
grades: Grade 1 (< 5 centroblasts per hpf), Grade 2 (6 to 15 centroblasts/hpf) and
Grade 3  (> 15 centroblasts/hpf).  Grade 3  is  further  subdivided  into  Grade 3A
(centrocytes  still  present)  and  Grade 3B  (the  follicles  consist  almost  entirely  of
centroblasts).  Grades  1 through  3A  are  considered  to  be  indolent  and  incurable,
whereas  Grade 3B  is  considered  an  aggressive  but  curable  disease  similar  to
DLBCL.4 The  Ann  Arbor  staging  system  includes:  Stage  I  (IE)  – single lymph
node region or extralymphatic site; Stage 2 (IIE) – multiple lymph node regions or
at least one lymph node region plus a localised extralymphatic site on the same
side  of  the  diaphragm;  Stage 3  (IIIE,  IIIS)  – multiple  lymph  node  regions  or
lymphoid structures (eg, thymus, Waldeyer’s ring) on both sides of the diaphragm
with optional localised extranodal site (IIIE) or spleen (IIIS); Stage 4 – diffuse or
disseminated extralymphatic organ involvement. The FLIPI risk factors include:
number  of  nodal  sites  or  long  diameter  of  largest  lymph  node;  age  > 60 years;
elevated lactate dehydrogenase or elevated β2-microglobulin; Ann Arbor Stage III
to IV or bone marrow involvement; and haemoglobin < 12 g/dL.7
The  overwhelming  majority  of  FL  patients  have  advanced  stage  disease  at
diagnosis, whereas less than 10% of patients have Stage 1/2 disease at diagnosis.
Studies have reported that 10% to 70% of patients transform to DLBCL over time,
with  an  estimated  risk  of  3%  per  year.  Common  symptoms  include  rapid
progression  of  lymphadenopathy,  extranodal  disease,  B  symptoms  (fever,  night
sweats, and weight loss) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase.10

free of the cancer of interest) for patients with FL ranged from 81% in black males 
to 87% in white females in the US.2
5-year  overall  and  relative  survival  rates  in  the  UK  HMRN  patients  diagnosed 
between 2004 and 2012, and followed through to 2014 were 75.6% (95% CI: 72.4-
78.5) and 86.5% (95% CI: 83.0-89.4), respectively.3
 Comorbidities  associated  with  FL  are  usually  due  to  the  advanced  age  of  the 
patient.  Such  patients  are  more  likely  to  develop  cardiovascular,  neurological, 
kidney injuries and complications as well as mucositis.11
Important co-morbidities
2.1.2
Multiple Myeloma
The incidence, prevalence, mortality, and demographics of the population of patients with MM are 
summarised in Table 2.1.2-1.
Table 2.1.2-1:
Epidemiologic Characteristics of Multiple Myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
Incidence and Prevalence
Demographics of the 
population: age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin
 MM accounts for about 10% to 18% of haematologic malignancies.12,13

The prevalence of MM varies from country to country in the EUk. Overall, the 
estimated prevalence of MM in the EU in 2018 ranges from 1.79 to 3.61 in 10,000 
persons (data on file). In Europe, 38,900 new cases of MM and 24,300 deaths due 
to MM were estimated in 2012. 14  
 Crude and age-standardised incidence rates (ASR) of MM in the population of 
the EU – 28 states are 6.6 and 3.0 per 100,000, respectively, based upon estimates 
obtained from GLOBOCAN 2012 data.14
The  1-year,  3-year,  and  5-year  number  of  persons  with  MM  and  prevalence 
proportions of MM (ages 15 years and older) in the EU-28 countries were 5.8 per 
100,000  persons,  13.4  per  100,000  persons  and  18.0  per  100,000 persons, 
respectively.14

 Gains in survivorship associated with new therapies will increase the prevalence 
of MM.

 MM incidence rates among males and females in Europe rise with increasing age 
intervals: 0.0 (ages 0 to 14 years), 0.2 (ages 15 to 39 years), 1.3 (ages 40 to 44 
years),  2.9  (ages  45  to  49  years),  5.2  (ages  50  to  54  years),  8.1  (ages  55  to 
59 years), 12.3 (ages 60 to 64 years), 17.9 (ages 65 to 69 years), 24.6 (ages 70 to 
74 years), 31.0 (ages 75 years and older).14
The ASR incidence of MM in men in the EU-28 countries is 3.7, based upon the 
diagnosis of MM in 18,043 men. MM accounted for 1.3% of all malignancies in 
men .14
The ASR incidence of MM in women in the EU-28 countries is 2.5, based upon 
the  diagnosis  of  MM  in  15,599  women.  MM  accounts  for  1.4%  of  all 
malignancies in women.14

 Analysing  18,824  MM  registrations  with  ethnicity  obtained  by linkage  to  the 
English  Hospital  Episodes  Statistics  Database, 15 reported  markedly  higher 
incidence rates of MM in Black African men (ASR 8.6 per 100,000) and Black 
Caribbean men (8.3) relative to White men (3.7). Similar results were obtained 
with  MM  incidence  rates  in  Black  African  women  (5.8)  and  Black  Caribbean 
women (5.7) were compared to White women (2.4). This pattern is similar to that 
reported in the US, where incidence rates of MM are markedly higher in Black 
men compared to White men (15.9 versus 7.8 per 100,000) and in Black women 
compared to White women (11.4 versus 4.6 per 100,000, respectively).16 Racial 
differences in rates were also observed in the US population.17
Risk factors for the 
disease 
Main treatment options 

 Age is the most important risk factor for MM, although race and gender are also 
important.  While  strong  familial  clustering  of  MM  suggests  that  underlying 
genetic  factors  are  important,  findings  from  studies  of  lifestyle,  dietary, 
occupational and environmental risk factors have been inconsistent.17,18
Treatment  options  are  currently  recommended  for  patients  with  NDMM  by 
ESMO,19 EMN ([TNE]20; [TE]21; [elderly]22); and NCCN.23
In  the  EU,  treatment  options  available  for  NDMM  approved  for  TE  NDMM 
include  VD  and  VTD.  Regimens  approved  for  TNE  NDMM  include 
lenalidomide;  Rd;  induction  therapy  with  lenalidomide,  melphalan  prednisone 
followed  by  single-agent  lenalidomide  (MPR+R);  bortezomib;  VMP;  MPT; 
bendamustine.  In  addition,  although  not  regulatory  authorised,  currently 
recommended per European clinical treatment guidelines and widely accepted as 
a  standard  of  care  and  pending  market  authorisation  is  the  combination  of 
lenalidomide,  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  (RVd),  in  the  TE  and  TNE 
populations.19,21,22
Treatment should be initiated in all patients with MM according to the updated 
definition proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group in 2014.24

Newly diagnosed MM



For  patients  with  NDMM,  the  choice  of  initial  therapy  is  determined  by  the 
patient’s age,  fitness/frailty  status,  and the  presence  of  comorbidities,  and  thus 
the ability to undergo auto-HSCT.19,23,25,26,27
The  current  ESMO  MM  guidelines  recommend  auto-HSCT  for  patients 
< 65 years or fit patients < 70 years in good clinical condition.19 Similarly, the 
EMN  guideline  for  TE  MM  patients  recommends  auto-HSCT  for  non-frail 
patients < 65 years; auto-HSCT should still be considered for patients < 65 years 
who  have  reduced  performance  status  or  comorbidities  when  the  benefit  of 
transplant  outweighs  the  risk.21 The  recently  published  EMN  guidelines  for 
elderly MM patients note that non-frail, elderly MM patients up to the age of 70 
years  (or  even 75  years)  without  prohibitive  comorbidities and  adequate  organ 
function may benefit from HDM followed by auto-ASCT.22
In  Europe,  TE  NDMM  patients  are  most  often  treated  with  bortezomib-
containing triplet regimens such as VTD (27%) and VCD (23%).28 In addition, 
a proportion of patients still receive the bortezomib-containing doublet regimen, 
VD (10%).


For  non-transplant  candidates  with  NDMM,  the  choice  of  treatment  is  more 
heterogeneous, with VMP (24%), VD (15%), and Rd (10%) the most commonly 
used regimens.28
Relapsed/Refractory MM



The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such 
as age, performance status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the 
previous treatment, the number of prior treatment lines, the available remaining 
treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the type of relapse (ie, 
clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed).29
Major  treatment  regimens  in  MM  for  R/R  disease  include:  carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone; bortezomib, dexamethasone and panobinostat; 
carfilzomib and dexamethasone; lenalidomide, dexamethasone and elotuzumab; 
lenalidomide,  dexamethasone  and  ixazomib;  bortezomib,  dexamethasone  and 
daratumumab; lenalidomide, dexamethasone and daratumumab.19
In  young  patients  (<  65  years  of  age),  a  second  ASCT  may  be  considered, 
provided the patient responded well to the previous ASCT and had a PFS of more 
than 24 months.30
In the relapse setting, allogenic stem cell transplant should only be carried out in 
the context of a clinical trial. In RRMM, the EMA has approved lenalidomide in 
combination  with  dexamethasone31,32 and  bortezomib  either  alone  as  a  single 
agent 33 or  in  combination  with  pegylated  doxorubicin. 34 Nevertheless, 
bortezomib  is  mostly  used  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  in  the  relapse 
setting. Thalidomide and bendamustine are effective drugs, often used, but not 
approved.35 Triplet  combinations  have  proved  effective  in  Phase 2  trials,  but 
only one single randomised trial has shown the superiority of VTD over TD for 
PFS in patients relapsing following ASCT.36
Thalidomide is also used in multiple combinations with clinical benefit in patients 
with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma.37
 When  possible,  patients  should  be  offered  participation  in  clinical  trials. 
Pomalidomide,35 the third-in-class IMiD, and carfilzomib,35 the second-in-class 
proteasome inhibitor, both are approved in the US and the EU. 
 Other  drugs  or  classes  of  drugs  such  as  histone-deacetylase  inhibitors, 
therapy  are  currently  under 
monoclonal  antibodies  and  other  CAR-T 
development.
 Crude and age-standardised mortality rates of MM in the EU-28 population are 
4.0  and  1.6  per  100,000,  respectively,  based  upon  estimates  obtained  from 
GLOBOCAN  2012.14 Within  the  EU-28  population,  20,462 men  and  women 
died  with  MM  in  2012.14 The  cumulative  mortality  risk  of  MM  (ages  0 to  74 
years) is 0.17%.
 According  to  GLOBOCAN  2012  data,  MM  accounts  for  1.2%  of  all  deaths 
among persons with invasive malignancy in the European population.14

 Between  1989  and  2009,  1206  patients  with  MM  were  identified  through  the 
Modena  Cancer  Registry,38 corresponding  to  periods  of  conventional  therapy 
(1988 to 1996), high dose melphalan (HDM) and ASCT (1997 to 2005) and novel 
agents (2006 to 2009). Relative survival and OS improved over the years, with 
little change noted for patients aged ≥ 75 years. The survival of MM patients aged

Among  216  patients  newly  diagnosed  with  MDS  (WHO subtypes)  during  the 
interval 1996 to 2005 and identified on the Düsseldorf Registry, the overall crude 
incidence  rate  (per  100,000 person-years)  was  3.78  (95%  CI:  3.31-4.32).  The 
overall age-standardised incidence was 2.51 per 100,000 person-years.66
In  an  analysis  of  data  from  the  North  American  Association  of  Central  Cancer 
Registries  (encompassing  82%  of  the  US  population),  the  average  annual 
age-adjusted incidence rate for MDS in 2001 to 2003 was 3.3 per 100,000.67 MDS 
incidence rates were highest among whites and non-Hispanics.

prevalence  of  MDS  was  assessed,  an  age-standardised  prevalence  of 
approximately  7  per  100,000  persons  was reported.  Given the  similar  incidence 
and  no  known  differences  in  disease  duration  or  treatment  options  between 
Western  European  countries,  the  prevalence  of  MDS  is  expected  to  be  similar 
throughout the EU.66
The overall ASR was 4.30 and 3.32 per 100,000 person-years for men and women, 
respectively, in the Düsseldorf MDS Registry. The incidence rate ratio comparing 
men  to  women  was  1.78  .66 However,  the  incidence  of  MDS  with  the  del  5q 
cytogenetic abnormality is greater in women than men. On the Düsseldorf MDS 
Registry in 2003, 2 (7%) female patients had the del 5q cytogenetic abnormality 
compared with no male patients.66
 Using  data  from  the  Düsseldorf  MDS  Registry,  in  2003  the  median  age  of 

prevalent male and female patients was 69 and 78 years, respectively.66
In  an  analysis  of  data  from  the  North  American  Association  of  Central  Cancer 
Registries, age adjusted incidence of MDS was significantly higher among males 
and  a  sharp  increase  was  observed  with  age;  rates  were  5  times  greater  among 
those aged 80 years and older (35.5 per 100,000) compared with those aged 60 to 
69 years (7.1 per 100,000).67
Risk factors for the 
disease 
Main treatment options 
Mortality and morbidity 
(natural history)

 Although  the  aetiology  of  MDS  remains  unclear,  risk  factors  for  the  disease 
include gender, age and exposure to ionising radiation, chemicals, drugs or other 
environmental agents.68
The  only  potentially  curative  approach  that  currently  exists  for  treating  MDS 
patients  is  allogeneic  HSCT. 69 This  approach  is  typically  only  employed  in 
younger patients with higher-risk disease because of morbidity/mortality and the 
lack  of  a  suitable  donor  in  older  patients;  hence,  allogeneic  HSCT  is  only  a 
potential solution in a small subset (approximately 5%) of MDS patients.68,69
 Other than transfusion support and iron chelation, the treatment options for low-
or INT-1-risk MDS, include ESAs (EPO or darbepoetin-α) alone or in combination 
with  G-CSF;  immunosuppressive  therapies  such  as  antithymocyte  globulin  or 
cyclosporin  A;  and  lenalidomide.69,70,71 ESAs  are unlikely  to  be  effective  for 
patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or INT-1 risk del 5q MDS 
as (1) these patients commonly have increased EPO levels, and ESAs have less 
effect in patients who already have adequate or high levels of EPO, (2) ESAs have 
been  found  to  be  less  effective  in  patients  who  have  a  significant  transfusion 
requirement,  and  (3)  ESAs  may  be  less  effective  in  patients  with  del  5q  MDS. 
Sanna  and  colleagues  have  reported  that  patients  with  del  5q  MDS  may  have 
higher endogenous EPO levels and reduced sensitivity to treatment with EPO.72
Patients  with  higher  endogenous  EPO  levels  and  more  substantial  transfusion 
requirements  have  a  relatively  low  likelihood  of  responding  to  treatment  with 
EPO.73,74,75
In the Multicentre Registry study, the median time of survival from diagnosis was 
75 months (range, 1.7 to 350). The 2- and 5-year survival probabilities were 86% 
and 61%, respectively. Transfusion-dependent patients had a median survival of 
44 months compared to 97 months for transfusion-independent patients.76

associated  with  survival,  whereas  race  was  not.  Younger  patients  demonstrated 
better survival, and men with MDS were 25% more likely to die than women.77
Progression to AML occurs at a variable rate depending on the presence of adverse 
prognostic  risk  factors.  In  the  Multicentre  Registry study,  the  cumulative  AML 
progression risk was 4.7% after 2 years of diagnosis and 14.7% (competing risk 
method).  In  the  first  2 years  following  diagnosis,  the  probability  of  developing 
AML was 11% for patients presenting with transfusion dependency compared with

Risk factors for the 
disease 

The  HAEMACARE  project  has  identified  1012  cases  of  MCL,  which  were 
diagnosed in 2000 to 2002 and archived in 44 European cancer registries.82 Based 
on these cases, the crude incidence of MCL is 0.45 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.42-
0.48). The estimated prevalence of MCL is 1 per 25,000.83
 According to the HAEMACARE project, the incidence of MCL in Europe is 0.64 
(95% CI: 0.60-0.69) in males and 0.27 (95% CI: 0.24–0.30) in females. Typically, 
patients with MCL are predominantly male, with a median age of > 60 years and 
present  with  advanced  stage  disease at  diagnosis,  as  well  as  extranodal 
involvement.84,85,86
 Given the rarity of MCL, large-scale epidemiologic studies of risk factors for NHL 
frequently do not include sufficient numbers of MCL patients to adequately assess 
risk factors for this disease. Little evidence exists to link MCL with environmental 
or occupational exposures, and lifestyle factors (eg, cigarette smoking, alcohol 
intake, body mass index) have not been implicated in the aetiology of MCL.
 Unlike  other  lymphomas  where  immune  suppression  and  exposure  to  specific 
infectious  agents  increase  lymphoma  risk,  evidence  for  association  between 
specific infectious agents and MCL is scarce. However, some studies have shown 
that the Ig gene repertoire in MCL is restricted and features precisely targeted, and 
probably functionally driven, somatic hypermutation.

Family  history  of  haematopoietic  malignancies has  been linked  with a two-fold 
increased risk  of  MCL.  In the  context  of  genetic  susceptibility  to  NHL,  there  is 
little evidence  of  highly  penetrant  genetic  traits  in association  with  the  disease. 
Instead, candidate gene studies focusing on low-penetrance polymorphic variants 
in the risk of NHL and its subtypes have consistently revealed associations with 
variants in genes encoding the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor, 
lymphotoxin-alpha and interleukin-10.87
In  the  front-line  setting,  MCL  is  a  chemosensitive  disease,  and  (immuno-) 
chemotherapy regimens (particularly rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, predniso(lo)ne [R-CHOP]) can achieve high response rates. However, 
almost all patients will eventually relapse.
Treatment  strategies  generally  depend  on  the  individual  risk  profile  and  the 
patient’s  comorbidities,  as  indicated  in  the  recommendations  of  the  European 
MCL Network and ESMO.88,89
Subsequent


 According  to  the  European  MCL  Network  Guidelines88 and  the  ESMO 
recommendations,89 there  is  no  single  standard  treatment  for  patients  with 
relapsed  disease.91 In  first  relapse  in  younger  fit  patients  (< 65 years  of  age, 
without severe comorbidities), the treatment goal is to achieve the best possible 
remission as a bridge to stem cell transplantation, whereas in transplant-ineligible 
patients, the objective is to induce long-lasting remissions.
The  treatment  guidelines  of  the  European  MCL  Network,88 ESMO,89 Spain,92
and the  UK,91 recommend  that  patients  with  multiple relapses  and  elderly  frail 
patients should be treated with single-agent therapy. The European MCL Network 
Guidelines  and  the  current  ESMO  therapeutic  recommendations89 recommend 
treatment  with temsirolimus, lenalidomide,  bortezomib, and  ibrutinib  preferably 
in  combination  (excluding  elderly,  frail  patients).  Other  single  agents  such  as 
fludarabine93,94 gemcitabine,95 rituximab,96 cytarabine,97 or  chlorambucil98,99
can also be considered. These agents are typically used sequentially. If a patient 
relapses or is refractory to one agent, then that patient is treated with another agent 
from this list of available agents.
Temsirolimus is approved for the treatment of RRMCL in the EU.100 In Feb 2012, 
pixantrone  received  a  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  in  the  EU  for  the 
treatment of adults with multiple relapsed and/or refractory aggressive NHL, but 
is not included in any of the MCL treatment guidelines. Ibrutinib was authorised 
in the EU for MCL in Oct 2014, indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
RRMCL.



In the US, ibrutinib is approved for MCL patients who have received at least one 
prior therapy. This was an accelerated approval.
The  treatment  guidelines  also  recommend bortezomib  in  patients  with  multiple 
relapses.89,91 This agent is approved in the US and several other countries for the 
treatment of MCL. In Jan 2015, bortezomib was authorised in combination with

Lenalidomide  single  agent  treatment  is  included  in  the  treatment  guidelines  for 
MCL,88,89,92 which is in line with the indication.
 Despite  intensive  induction  therapies  in  the  front-line  setting  of  young  and  fit 
patients,  the  clinical  course  is  typically  that  of  repeated  relapses,  and  median 
survival  of  patients  with  MCL is  only  3  to  5  years.101,102 Following the initial 
relapse, the median OS decreases to 1 to 2 years.103
 Based on a 2004 to 2012 analysis of the UK’s population-based HMRN, a registry 
with 5796 lymphoma patients and 247 MCL patients, the 5-year OS was 25% and 
relative survival was 31.4%.3
 Among 150 patients with advanced-stage nonblastoid MCL identified either in the 
KLSG  (1975  to  1986)  or  in  the  GLSG  (1996  to  2004),  median  OS  has  almost 
doubled over the past 30 years. Five-year survival rates were 22% in the KLSG

high doses used. The histological changes in the kidney 
were reversible, and therefore appear to be  of limited 
clinical relevance.  NOAEL  in rats  was  determined to 
be 300 mg/kg/day.
In  monkeys, 
repeated  oral  administration  of 
lenalidomide resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in 
neutrophil  count,  an  effect  that  is  related  to  the 
pharmacodynamic  effect  of  the  drug.  Repeated  oral 
administration  of  4 and  6 mg/kg/day  to  monkeys 
produced  mortality  and  significant  toxicity  (marked 
weight  loss,  reduced  red  and  white  blood  cell  and 
platelet 
counts,  multiple  organ  haemorrhage, 
gastrointestinal  tract  inflammation,  lymphoid,  and 
bone  marrow  atrophy).  Monkeys  dosed  with  1  and 
2 mg/kg/day for up to 52 weeks exhibited changes in 
bone marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid: 
erythroid  cell  ratio,  and 
thymic  atrophy.  Mild 
suppression of the white blood cell count was observed 
at 1 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL in monkeys was 1 mg/kg, 
based  on  the  minimal  severity,  lack  of  associated 
toxicologically  significant  haematologic  effect,  and 
expected  recovery  of  thymic  atrophy  at  this  dose  as 
demonstrated by a recovery at higher doses.a
 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with 
lenalidomide have been conducted in rats, rabbits and 
monkeys. 
Embryofoetal  developmental  toxicity  studies  were 
conducted in rats, rabbits, and monkeys. In monkeys, 
malformations  occurred  in  the  foetuses  at  0.5 mg/kg, 
the  lowest  lenalidomide  dose  tested.  Exposure  in 
monkeys at this dose (AUC of 378 ng•hr/mL) was 0.17 
to 0.41 times the exposure from a human clinical dose 
of 25 mg/day (AUC of 2262 ng•hr/mL) and 10 mg/day 
(933 ng•hr/mL), respectively.
Malformations

malrotated  hindlimbs  at  0.5 mg/kg/day  to  severe 
external  malformations,  such  as  bent,  shortened, 
malformed, malrotated and/or partially absent parts of 
extremities,  oligo- and/or  polydactyly  and/or  non 
patent  anus  at 4 mg/kg/day.  Limb  and  digital  defects 
correlated  with  skeletal  findings  at  ≥ 1 mg/kg/day. 
These  malformations  were  similar to  those  seen  with 
the  positive  control  thalidomide,  a  known  human 
teratogen.
In  rats,  oral  doses  up  to  500 mg/kg  lenalidomide  did 
not affect embryofoetal development. In the definitive 
embryofoetal development study in rabbits conducted 
at  doses  up  to  20 mg/kg/day,  maternal  toxicity  was 
seen  at  ≥ 10 mg/kg/day,  and  a  dose  of  20 mg/kg/day

Mechanisms for Drug Interactions
Lenalidomide is not a substrate of human cytochrome 
P450  (CYP)  enzymes,  and  hence  is  not  likely  to  be 
subject to drug-drug interactions when co-administered 
with CYP inhibitors or inducers. Lenalidomide did not 
significantly  inhibit  CYP1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1, 
or 3A4 isoforms and was not a CYP inducer in vitro. 
Hence,  lenalidomide  is  not  likely  to  precipitate 
clinically 
interactions  when 
co-administered with CYP substrates. Furthermore, at 
concentrations  up  to  150 µM,  lenalidomide  is  not  an 
inhibitor  of  the  BSEP,  human  MRP2,  human  OAT1 
and  OAT3,  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3,  and  OCT2. 
Lenalidomide  is  not  a  substrate  of  MRP1,  MRP2,  or 
MRP3 efflux transporters, or OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 
(OATP2),  OCT1,  OCT2,  OCTN1,  OCTN2,  or 
MATE1. Lenalidomide is a weak substrate but not an 
inhibitor  of  P-gp.  Lenalidomide  is  not  a  substrate  or 
inhibitor  (at  concentrations  up  to  150 µM)  of  BCRP. 
Therefore,  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions 
are  unlikely  between  lenalidomide  and  substrates  or 
inhibitors of these transporters.

Clinical Trial Exposure
Clinical Study Information
The data presented in this section represent the main studies supporting the FL, TE NDMM, TNE 
NDMM, RRMM, del 5q MDS and MCL indications. Data from Studies MDS-001, MDS-002 and 
MDS-007 are not included in this RMP. MDS-001 and MDS-002 represent a broader indication 
which  does  not  reflect the target  population  in  detail  and  would  therefore  dilute  safety  signals. 
These clinical trials are not related to the approved indication (which would be in accordance with 
the GVP as only proposed and approved indications should be pooled and not studies in different 
indications under development ie, paediatrics). MDS-007 represents the approved indication, but 
represents  solely  the  Japanese  population.  This  study  was  considered  for  the  overall  safety  of 
lenalidomide and no differences in risk due to ethnic origin have been identified.
In  addition,  data  from  Study  CC-5013-MCL-003  have  not  been  presented  in  this  RMP. 
Study MCL-003  was  a  Phase  3,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
first-line  maintenance  study  of  lenalidomide  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  mantle  cell 
lymphoma  (the  “RENEW”  trial),  that  was  stopped  prematurely  for  reasons  other  than  safety 
concerns  after only  nine  patients  had  been  enrolled  (four  in  the  lenalidomide  arm,  five  in  the 
placebo arm).
Data  published  subsequent  to  the  time  of  the  study  planning  suggested  that  the  duration  of 
remission and OS time after a response to R-CHOP were significantly shorter among patients who 
were not assigned to any maintenance therapy, as compared with those who received maintenance 
therapy (rituximab or interferon alpha).110 In light of these findings, the MCL-003 study design, 
which included a placebo control arm, was no longer considered clinically appropriate.
The study population in Study MCL-003 was different to those in Studies MCL-002 and MCL-001 
as it consisted of newly diagnosed MCL patients achieving a complete response or partial response 
after  first-line  induction  chemoimmunotherapy  (anthracycline  based,  fludarabine  based,  or 
rituximab-bendamustine combination). In addition, the starting dose of lenalidomide maintenance 
treatment in Study MCL-003 was 15 mg compared to a lenalidomide starting dose of 25 mg in the 
other studies. Finally, all four patients in the lenalidomide arm had short treatment durations.

2.3.2
Clinical Studies in Follicular Lymphoma
The  safety  data  presented  are  primarily  based  on  data  from  2  BMS-sponsored  studies, 
CC-5013-NHL-007 (NHL-007) and CC-5013-NHL-008 (NHL-008). 
In Study NHL-007, patients were aged ≥ 18 with histologically confirmed MZL or FL previously 
treated with at least one prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy 
and  had  received  at  least  2  previous  doses  of  rituximab.  Only  data  from  patients  with  FL  are 
included in this RMP. Patients had documented relapsed, refractory or progressive disease after 
treatment with systemic therapy and were not rituximab-refractory. Patients were randomised (1:1 
ratio) to treatment with either:

lenalidomide 20 mg QD orally (Days 1 to 21 in each 28 day cycle)  for up to 12 cycles plus 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV (Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in Cycle 1 and Day 1 in Cycles 2 to 5 of each 
28-day cycle) or,
 matching placebo (QD) plus rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV (Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in Cycle 1 and 
Day 1 in Cycles 2 to 5 of each 28-day cycle). 

Study NHL-008 recruited patients aged ≥ 18 with histologically confirmed FL Grades 1 to 3b or 
transformed  FL,  MZL,  or  MCL  who  had  received  ≥ 1  prior  therapy  and  had  Stage  I  to  IV, 
measurable  disease.  Only  data  from  patients  with  FL  are  included  in  this  RMP.  Patients  had 
documented relapsed, refractory or progressive disease after last treatment with systemic therapy. 
Patients received induction therapy (ie, initial treatment period) of lenalidomide 20 mg QD orally 
(Days 1 to 21 in each 28-day cycle) for 12 cycles plus IV rituximab 375 mg/m2, Days 1, 8, 15, and

22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 (28-day cycles). Patients were then randomised 
(1:1 ratio) to maintenance (ie, extended treatment) lenalidomide 10 mg/day on Days 1 to 21 of 
each 28-day cycle, for Cycles 13 to 30, plus rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of Cycles 13, 15, 
17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29, or rituximab 375 mg/m2 alone (same schedule). Safety data included 
for  NHL-008  were  based  on  the  initial  treatment  period  (induction  phase)  in  patients  with  FL 
Grade 1 to 3a, only.
The demographics and baseline characteristics of FL patients in Studies NHL-007 and NHL-008 
are presented in Table 2.3.2-1, while duration of exposure to study medication is presented in Table 
2.3.2-2.
In both studies, approximately half of the safety population were younger than 65 years of age, the 
majority  of  patients  were  white  and  non-Hispanic  and  the  proportion  of  males  to  females  was 
balanced in both studies. The majority of FL patients in both studies had a histological diagnosis 
of Grade 1 to 2. In Study NHL-007, a higher proportion of patients had an Ann Arbor Stage I or 
II  at  diagnosis  compared  with  Study  NHL-008,  whereas  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in 
Study NHL-008 had an Ann Arbor Stage IV. In both studies, the majority of patients did not have 
elevated lactate dehydrogenase and had no B symptoms at baseline.
The  median  treatment  duration  was  longer  in  Study  NHL-007  (11.0  and  11.2  months  in  the 
rituximab  plus  placebo  and  lenalidomide  plus  rituximab  arms,  respectively)  compared  to 
Study NHL-008 (7.4 months). Consistent with this trend, the median number of treatment cycles 
was higher in Study NHL-007 (12.0 in both arms) compared with Study NHL-008 (7.0), and the 
majority  of  patients  in  both  the  lenalidomide  and  placebo  arms  of  Study  NHL-007  received 
12 cycles  (72.6%  and  60.1%,  respectively)  compared  with  around  a  third  of  patients  in 
Study NHL-008 (29.4%). Per the data lock point for this FL RMP, data from Study NHL-008 are 
based on an ongoing actively enrolling study. Hence, the proportion of the patients who completed 
all 12 cycles of lenalidomide plus rituximab is less than in Study NHL-007.
Overall,  no clinically  meaningful differences  in demographic and disease-related characteristics 
were observed, and the treatment arms  in NHL-007 were generally  balanced with regard to the 
demographic and disease-related characteristics.

In Study CALGB 100104, patients were aged ≥ 18 to 70 years with active MM requiring treatment

candidates  and  willing  to  undergo  HDM  with  ASCT  rescue.  Ninety  to  100 days  post-ASCT, 
patients underwent disease and response evaluation and received treatment after stratification and 
randomisation (1:1 ratio) to maintenance treatment with either lenalidomide or placebo on Days 1 
to  28  of  a  28-day  cycle  (28/28  days)  until  disease  progression  or  treatment  intolerance. 
Randomisation was stratified by baseline β2 microglobulin (elevated, ≥ 2.5 mg/L versus normal), 
prior therapy with thalidomide (yes/no), and prior therapy with lenalidomide (yes/no). The starting 
dose of lenalidomide or placebo was 10 mg/day (28/28 days) for the first 3 months, increased to 
15 mg/day if the patient’s ANC ≥ 1000/μL, platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL, and any nonhaematologic 
toxicity was no greater than Grade 1. 
In  Study  IFM  2005-02,  patients  were  <  65  years  of  age  with  MM  who  had  received  an  initial 
treatment with induction therapy and ASCT. Within ≤ 6 months after ASCT and randomisation, 
all patients (ie, after enrolment of the first 32 patients) received 2 cycles of consolidation treatment 
with lenalidomide 25 mg QD orally (21/28 days) before their assigned maintenance treatment with 
either  lenalidomide  or  placebo  until  disease  progression.  The  starting  dose  of  lenalidomide  or 
placebo was 10 mg once a day for the first 3 months, increased to 15 mg/day if tolerated.
The AE data collection methodologies differed in several ways between the 2 studies and appeared 
to result in noticeable differences in the reported frequencies and severities of several TEAEs both

lenalidomide
in the lenalidomide and the placebo treatment arms. Many of these disparities can be attributed to 
the  lack of collection of  AE start and stop dates on the AE CRF  in Study CALGB 100104,  for 
which  instead  AE  reporting  periods  were  used  for  estimation  of  AE  onset  (EU  SCS  Section 
1.2.1.1), and differences between the 2 studies in how AEs were reported via the design of the AE 
and other safety-related CRF pages. In Study CALGB 100104 only, the AE CRF reporting form 
had  8  preprinted  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  terms:  “ANC,” 
“platelets,”  “febrile  neutropenia,”  “weight  gain,”  “rash,”  “bilirubin,”  “diarrhea,”  and 
“pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates”. Investigators were instructed to report AEs of all grades for 
these 8 preprinted AEs, and to report AEs other than these 8 if they were of Grade ≥ 3 severity 
(other events of Grade 1 or 2 severity could be reported, but this was not a protocol requirement). 
Also, this CRF page contained prompts and reminders for reporting infections with Grade 3 or 4 
neutrophils,  mucositis/stomatitis,  and  new  malignancies  (SPM)  (EU  SCS  Section 1.2.1.2.1).  In 
Study CALGB 100104, start dates were reported for SAEs; SAEs represented expedited events in 
the AdEERS.
Recognising  these  differences,  the  primary  data  presentation  is  the  evaluation  of  side-by-side 
comparisons of individual study arms from both studies to provide a clinically meaningful review 
ASCT  setting. 
of  the  overall  safety  data  of  lenalidomide  10 mg  QD  maintenance  in  the  post
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurred more frequently in both treatment arms of Study CALGB 100104 
compared to Study IFM 2005-02. Those differences in Grade 3 or 4 TEAE frequencies observed 
in the placebo arms (55.2% in Study CALGB 100104 versus 32.1% in Study IFM 2005-02; EU 
SCS, Table 24) suggest a potential carryover effect from HDM/ASCT in Study CALGB 100104 
(ie, close proximity of transplant to start of maintenance). Based on this observation and to further 
investigate this impact, analyses were conducted comparing the frequencies of all AEs collected 
post-transplant during maintenance therapy versus the frequencies when AEs possibly occurring 
before start of maintenance (ie, during the “post
ASCT period”) are excluded. The latter analysis 
was  done  for  TEAEs  of  all  grades  and  Grade 3  or  4  TEAEs  although  these  2  categories  were 
-
possibly  impacted  by  carryover  effect  of  HDM/ASCT  due  to  collection  of  AE  using  reporting 
periods, and not specific stop/start dates.
-
The median time from ASCT to the start of treatment was 3.3 months for Study CALGB 100104 
and  3.4 months  for  Study IFM 2005-02  (EU  Summary  of  Clinical  Efficacy,  Table  33).  In 
Study IFM 2005-02,  patients  in  both  the  lenalidomide  and  placebo  arms  underwent  2 cycles  of 
lenalidomide (25 mg/day for 21 of 28 day cycles) consolidation therapy immediately prior to the 
start of maintenance therapy.
The  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  in  Studies CALGB 100104  and 
IFM 2005-02 are presented  in Table 2.3.3-1, while duration of exposure to study  medication  is 
presented in Table 2.3.3-2.
In Studies CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02, the majority of the safety population were younger 
than 60 years of age, and the proportion of  males to females was balanced  in both studies. The 
majority of patients  in Study CALGB 100104 were white or Caucasian; race and ethnicity data 
were  not  collected  in  Study IFM 2005-02.  In  both  studies,  the  majority  of  patients  had  an 
International Staging System (ISS) Stage I or II at diagnosis. In Study CALGB 100104, 3 patients

(1.3%) in the lenalidomide arm (no patients in the placebo arm) and in Study IFM 2005-02, no 
patients in the lenalidomide arm and only one patient in the placebo arm (0.4%) had severe renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CLcr] < 30 mL/min) post-ASCT. The proportions of patients 
with moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min to < 50 mL/min) were 8.5% and 6.3% in the 
lenalidomide and placebo arms of Study CALGB 100104, respectively, and 3.1% and 2.5% in the 
lenalidomide and placebo arms of Study IFM 2005-02, respectively, post-ASCT.
Overall,  no clinically  meaningful differences  in demographic and disease-related characteristics 
were  observed,  and  the  treatment  arms  were  balanced  with  regard  to  the  demographic  and 
disease-related  characteristics.  In  Study  IFM 2005-02,  at  diagnosis  there  was  an  imbalance 
between treatment arms in the distribution of the ISS stage categories, and patients with a reduced 
CLcr (< 50 mL/min).

In Study CALGB 100104, exposure for patients in the lenalidomide arm during maintenance was 
more than double than in the placebo arm prior to cross over to lenalidomide as reflected in the 
mean  treatment  duration.  The  duration  of  placebo  maintenance  treatment  was  limited  by  the 
interim  unblinding  (EU  SCS  Section  1.1.4.1.1.1).  In  Study IFM 2005-02,  the  mean  treatment 
duration of maintenance therapy of lenalidomide was 24.0 months compared to 19.7 months in the 
placebo arm. The duration of maintenance treatment in both arms was limited due to changes in 
the study conduct (EU SCS Section 1.1.4.1.1.2).
Of the 221 patients in Study CALGB 100104 and 280 patients in Study IFM 2005-02 who received 
placebo maintenance, mean treatment duration for placebo patients was more than 6 months longer 
in  Study IFM 2005-02  compared  to  Study  CALGB 100104  (19.7 months  versus  13.2 months,

respectively).  The  shorter  exposure  in  placebo  patients  can  be  explained  by  the  timing  of  the 
interim analysis and study unblinding (17 Dec 2009) relative to the prolonged enrolment period. 
These  patients  either  discontinued

Clinical Studies in Transplant Non-eligible Newly Diagnosed Multiple 
Myeloma
Study SWOG S0777 (RVd initial treatment)
Study SWOG S0777 was a cooperative group study. A total of 523 patients with NDMM who had 
received no prior chemotherapy were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:
 Arm  A: Six  28-day  cycles  (24  weeks)  of  Rd  (initial  treatment);  patients  who  completed 
≥ 4 cycles of Rd initial treatment continued Rd therapy until PD.
 Lenalidomide 25 mg/day administered orally on Days 1 to 21
 Dexamethasone 40 mg/day administered orally on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
 Arm B: Eight 21-day cycles (24 weeks) of RVd (initial treatment); patients who completed 
≥ 6 cycles  but were not able to tolerate a total of 8 cycles of  initial treatment continued Rd 
(same regimen as for treatment therapy for Arm A) until PD.
 Lenalidomide 25 mg/day administered orally on Days 1 to 14
 Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11
 Dexamethasone 20 mg/day administered orally on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12.
Patients  were  stratified  at  progression  by  ISS  stage  (I,  II,  III),  and  by  intent  to  transplant  at 
progression (yes versus no). As of the 01 Dec 2016 data cutoff date, five patients (one in the RVd 
arm  and  four  in  the  Rd  arm)  were  randomised  but  not  treated.  Of  the  518  treated  patients, 
201 patients  (110  in  the  RVd  arm  and  91  in  the  Rd  arm)  received  initial  treatment  but  did  not 
continue on to the continued Rd treatment phase of the study treatment (ie, discontinued from the 
study treatment during initial treatment). 
2.3.4.1
Safety Data Collection
Adverse  events  were  recorded  on  paper  AE  summary  forms  (teleforms),  which  contained 
80 preprinted CTCAE terms. In addition, investigators were instructed to report all other AEs in 
the free-text field at the end of AE summary form. The teleform data submission was replaced by 
44
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986380
Version 39.1
lenalidomide
an online form that allowed the investigator to select the CTCAE term from a dropdown list of all 
CTCAE 3.0 terms; the option for a free-text entry was no longer needed. 
Per the study protocol, safety assessments were recorded every 3 months while the patient was on 
protocol  treatment  and  within  14  days  after  completion  of  initial  treatment  and  completion  of 
continued  Rd  therapy.  For  AEs  reported  via  the  original  AE  paper  forms  (teleform  data 
submission), specific AE start and stop dates were not collected; only the start date of the 3-month 
AE  reporting  period  was  collected.  BMS  used  the  start  date of  the  corresponding  3-month  AE 
reporting period as the start date for each individual AE; stop dates were not imputed. For AEs 
reported electronically  via the online  form, specific  AE start and stop dates were not collected; 
however, the start and end dates of the AE reporting period for routine AEs were collected. The 
Off Treatment Notice form provided the information for AEs leading to discontinuation. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of patients are presented in Table 2.3.4.1-1, while 
duration of exposure to study medication is presented in Table 2.3.4.1-2.
Patients ranged in age from 28.0 to 87.0 years, with a median age of 63.0 years in each treatment 
arm. Overall, there were slightly more male patients (57.5%) than female patients (42.5%), and 
the  majority  of  patients  were  Caucasian  (79.7%).  No clinically  meaningful  differences  in 
demographics were observed, and the treatment arms were generally balanced.

As of the data cutoff date of 01 Dec 2016, the medium treatment duration was 24.0 weeks (range 
0.4 to 36.6) with RVd and 24.1 weeks (range 1.3 to 35.1) with Rd during  initial treatment. For 
48%  of  patients  treated  with  RVd  and  50%  of  patients  treated  with  Rd,  the  duration  of  initial 
treatment was > 24 weeks.
Study CC-5013-MM-020
In Study CC-5013-MM-020 (hereafter referred to as Study MM-020), a total of 1613 patients from 
Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
and UK), Asia (China, Taiwan, and Republic of Korea), and North America/Pacific (US, Canada, 
Australia, and New Zealand) regions were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms:
 Treatment  Arm  A  (Rd),  lenalidomide  (25 mg/day)  and  low-dose  dexamethasone  (given  on 
Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) in repeated 28-day cycles until documentation of PD; 
 Treatment Arm B (Rd18), lenalidomide (25 mg/day) and low-dose dexamethasone (given on 
Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) in repeated 28-day cycles for up to 18 cycles (72 weeks);
 Treatment Arm C (MPT), melphalan, prednisone (given on Days 1 to 4) and thalidomide in a 
42-day cycle for up to 12 cycles (72 weeks).
Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (≤ 75 years versus > 75 years), stage (ISS Stages I 
or II versus Stage III), and country. 
Of the 1613 enrolled patients, 535 were randomised to Arm Rd, 541 to Arm Rd18, and 547 to Arm 
MPT;  of  those,  3  in  Arm  Rd,  1  in  Arm  Rd18,  and  6  in  Arm  MPT  were  never  treated.  The 
demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  are  presented  in Table  2.3.4.1-3,  while 
duration of exposure to study medication is presented in Table 2.3.4.1-4.
The majority of the study population are elderly patients. The median age is 73.0 years across all 
3 treatment  arms;  65.2%  are  ≤  75  years  and  34.9%  are  >  75  years.  The  study  population  also 
included 92 patients (5.7%) who were < 65 years; these patients were deemed ineligible for stem 
cell transplant but the reasons for the ineligibility were not systematically captured.

Overall, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population included a balanced proportion of males (52.6%) to 
females  (47.4%)  and  the  majority  were  white  or  Caucasian  (89.0%),  non-Hispanic  or 
Latino (92.8%), and from Europe (68.6%). In general, study patients had advanced stage disease. 
Of the total study population, 40.6% had ISS Stage III, approximately  half  had some degree of 
renal  insufficiency  (CLcr  < 60 mL/min),  71.2% had  a history  of  bone  disease,  and  13.5%  had 
radiation  for  MM  prior to treatment  in  the  study  (see  Table  14.1.1.1.1,  MM-020  clinical  study 
report [CSR]).
Overall,  no clinically  meaningful differences  in demographic and disease-related characteristics 
were  observed,  and  the  treatment  arms  were  balanced  with  regard  to  the  demographic  and 
disease-related  characteristics.  The  medical  history  includes  a  number  of  comorbidities  and 
manifestations of the disease for this elderly population: hypertension (59.8%), anaemia (57.5%), 
back pain (32.3%), bone pain (22.6%), hypercholesterolemia (17.6%), diabetes (“Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus,” 7.6%; “diabetes mellitus,” 6.5%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (7.5%), and obesity 
(2.3%). Of the total patients, 29.3% had a history of cardiac disorders including atrial fibrillation 
(7.7%),  coronary  artery  disease  (4.1%),  and  myocardial 
infarction  (MI;  4.0%)  (see 
Table 14.1.3.2.1,  MM-020  CSR).  Other  important  comorbidities  were  DVT  (1.5%),  pulmonary 
embolism  (1.8%),  and  CVA  (2.6%).  History  of  invasive  malignancies  was  also  documented  in 
10.4% of the total patients (Table 14.1.4.2.1.4, MM-020 CSR).

The  median  treatment  duration  in  Arm  Rd,  80.2  weeks  (range:  0.7,  246.7),  was  longer  than  in 
either Arm Rd18 (72.0 weeks [range: 0.9, 102.6]) or Arm MPT (67.1 weeks [range: 0.1, 110.0]) 
owing  to  the  study  design,  which  proposed  treatment  in  Arm  Rd  to  continue  until  disease 
progression.  Treatments  in  Arm  Rd18  and  Arm  MPT  were  both  capped  at  72  weeks  (eighteen 
28-day  cycles  and  six  42-day  cycles,  respectively).  Overall,  58.3%  (Arm  Rd18)  and 
61.4% (Arm MPT)  of  patients  were  treated  for  72  weeks  or  less,  including  patients  who 
discontinued treatment.
As  of  the  24  May  2013  cutoff,  208  patients  in  Arm  Rd  (39%)  were  treated  for  > 2  years  and 
98 patients (18%) were treated for > 3 years. 
The total number of person-years on study treatment in each treatment arm was 921 in Arm Rd, 
587 in Arm Rd18, and 549 in Arm MPT.
Study CC-5013-MM-015
In Study CC-5013-MM-015 (hereafter referred to as Study MM-015), a total of 459 stem cell TNE 
patients were randomised to treatment in the double-blind treatment phase of the study in a 1:1:1 
ratio of:



Induction therapy (up to 9 cycles) with melphalan/prednisone plus lenalidomide followed by 
maintenance  therapy  with  single-agent  lenalidomide  (hereafter  referred  to  as  MPR+R); 
10 mg/day on Days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles, given until disease progression.
Induction therapy (up to 9 cycles) with melphalan/prednisone plus lenalidomide followed by 
maintenance therapy with single-agent placebo (hereafter referred to as MPR+p).
Induction  therapy  (up to  9  cycles)  with  melphalan/prednisone  plus  placebo  (p)  followed  by 
maintenance therapy with single-agent placebo (hereafter referred to as MPp+p).
Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (≤ 75 years versus > 75 years) and disease stage 
(ISS; Stages I and II versus Stage III).111
Of the 459 patients randomised to treatment, 152, 153 and 154 patients were randomised to receive 
MPR+R,  MPR+p  and  MPp+p,  respectively.  Overall,  455  patients  were  included  in  the  safety 
population  (150,  152  and  153  in  the  MPR+R,  MPR+p  and  MPp+p  arms,  respectively).  The 
demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  are  presented  in Table  2.3.4.1-5,  while 
duration of exposure to study medication is presented in Table 2.3.4.1-6.
The ITT population included approximately equal numbers of females (50.3%) and males (49.7%), 
and almost all patients were white (98.7%). Patients ranged in age from 65.0 to 91.0 years (median,

71.0 years), and approximately half of patients in each treatment arm were ISS Stage III. Overall, 
the three treatment arms were well balanced. The only notable exception was baseline Karnofsky 
performance  status,  which  was  significantly  different  between  the  MPR+R  and  MPp+p  arms 
(median, 80% and 90%, respectively). 
In general, no clinically notable differences in medical histories were observed between the three 
treatment arms. The majority of the patients had a history of musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders  (73.0%  of  patients;  eg,  osteoporosis,  back  pain,  bone  pain,  and  osteoarthritis);  and 
vascular disorders (65.7% of patients; eg, hypertension); and blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(65.3% of patients; eg, anaemia) (see Table 14.1.5, MM-015 CSR). Thirty-one percent (31.4%) of 
patients  had  a  history  of  cardiac  disorders,  the  most  common  of  which  included  myocardial 
ischemia  (8.4%)  and  atrial  fibrillation  (5.7%).  Few  patients  had  a  history  of  venous 
thromboembolism:  DVT  (1.5%),  pulmonary  embolism  (1.3%),  thrombophlebitis  (0.9%),  and 
venous  thrombosis  (< 0.2%).  A  total  of  31/455  patients  (6.8%)  had  a  history  of  prior  invasive 
malignancy that had been inactive for ≥ 3 years prior to screening, with the exception of 1 patient 
who had prostate cancer diagnosed 1 year and 9 months prior to entering the study. Approximately 
half of the patients in each treatment arm had CLcr < 60 mL/min.

It  should  be  noted  that  dosing  information  in  the  maintenance  period  is  difficult  to  compare 
between arms due to patients in Arms MPR+p and MPp+p stopping treatment (placebo) following 
unblinding of the study. As a result, the  median cumulative dose in the maintenance phase was

Clinical Studies in Del 5q MDS with or without Additional Cytogenetic 
Abnormalities
In Study CC-5013-MDS-003 (hereafter referred to as Study MDS-003), which includes extension 
Study CC-5013-MDS-003E/009  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study MDS-003E/009),  where  no 
additional treatment was given, rather as explained below, additional information was captured, 
patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  low- or  INT-1-risk  del  5q  MDS  and  RBC-transfusion-dependent 
anaemia  were  treated  with  lenalidomide  10 mg  orally  QD.  Initially,  this  was  as  a  syncopated 
dosage regimen  in which patients received  lenalidomide 10 mg orally QD on Days 1 to 21 of a 
28-day cycle. Following a protocol amendment, a continuous dosage regimen (ie, 10 mg orally 
on Day 1 to 28 of a 28-day cycle) was used in which there was no planned rest period. The decision 
to change the dosing regimen from a syncopated regimen to a continuous regimen was taken when 
additional data from a Phase 1/2 study (Study MDS-501-001) became available to suggest that a 
continuous regimen of  lenalidomide (10 mg of  lenalidomide QD without a planned rest period) 
produced an earlier response, with no additional safety concerns.
After  the  MDS-003  study  was  closed,  the  need  for  longer-term  follow-up  was  identified.  The 
MDS-003E  (Germany)/MDS-009  (US)  (MDS-003E/MDS-009)  study  was  a  non-interventional 
(no  study  drug  was  provided  under  the  protocol),  multi-centre,  follow-up  extension  study  of 
patients  previously enrolled  in  MDS-003.  It  was  conducted  specifically  to  provide  further 
long-term outcomes for OS/vital status (including date of death or last known date alive, primary 
underlying cause of death, and other significant conditions contributing to death) and the possible 
occurrence of progression to AML for patients previously enrolled in the MDS-003 study and to 
further analyse these outcomes based on the long-term follow-up data obtained.
Overall, 148 patients were enrolled into Study MDS-003, all of whom received lenalidomide and 
completed  the  study.  Forty-six  patients  started  with  the  syncopated  dosage  regimen  of  which 
6 patients  switched  to  a  continuous  dosage  regimen;  102  patients  started  with  the  continuous 
dosage  regimen.  Study MDS-003  was  completed  on  27  Aug  2008  and  the  extension 
Study MDS-003E/009 was completed on 01 Oct 2010. Study MDS-003E/009 was only intended 
to  collect  follow-up  data  as  described  above  from  Study MDS-003.  The  demographics  and 
baseline characteristics of patients are summarised in Table 2.3.6-1, while duration of exposure to 
study medication is presented in Table 2.3.6-2.

The  study  population  reflected  that  observed  in  clinical  practice,  and  included  more  females 
(65.5%) than males (34.5%), as would be expected for this patient population. Patients ranged in 
age from 37 to 95 years, with a median age of 71.0 years. Overall 9 (6.1%) patients had INT-2 or 
high-risk del 5q MDS according to the central review. One hundred and ten (74.3%) patients had 
an  MDS  clone  with  an  isolated  del  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality,  25  (16.9%)  patients  had 
intermediate  cytogenetic  complexity,  and  12  (8.1%)  patients  had  complex  cytogenetic 
abnormalities.
Overall,  the  median  duration  of  treatment  was  52.5 weeks  (range,  0.4  to  253.0 weeks) 
and 62.8% (93/148) of patients received treatment for at least 32 weeks, indicating a long duration 
of lenalidomide treatment in the study patients.

Of the 148 patients who were enrolled in Study MDS-003, 76 had died at the time of writing the 
final  MDS-003  CSR  and  18  did  not  participate  in  the  extension  study.  Thus,  54  patients  were 
included in the extension study follow-up cohort. The median duration of follow-up for all patients 
in Study MDS-003 at the time of the final MDS-003 CSR was 2.8 years (33.9 months; range, 0.3 
to 58.2 months). Following completion of the extension study (intended to collect follow-up data 
only),  the  median  duration  of  follow-up  for  all  MDS-003  patients  was  3.2 years  (38.4 months; 
range, 0.3 to 81.9 months).
In Study CC-5013-MDS-004 (hereafter referred to as Study MDS-004), patients were randomised 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms:
 Lenalidomide 10 mg: oral lenalidomide 10 mg (two 5 mg capsules) QD on Days 1 to 21 and 
2 placebo capsules QD on Days 22 to 28, every 28 days.
 Lenalidomide 5 mg: oral lenalidomide 5 mg (one 5 mg capsule) plus 1 placebo capsule QD, 
every 28 days.
 Placebo: 2 placebo capsules QD, every 28 days.
In  Study MDS-004,  all  205  enrolled  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  study 
medication  and  were  included  in  the  safety  population  (69,  69  and  67 patients  received 
lenalidomide  10 mg,  lenalidomide  5 mg  and  placebo,  respectively).  Of  the  67  placebo  patients, 
56 crossed-over to lenalidomide 5 mg; however, 11 received only placebo (ie, the patients received 
no  lenalidomide).  The  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  are  summarised  in
Table 2.3.6-3, while duration of exposure to study medication is presented in Table 2.3.6-4.
In the safety population, there were more females than males (71.0% to 80.6% of patients were 
female across the three treatment groups), consistent with the expected demographics for a del 5q

MDS  population.  The  mean  age  was  66.2  to  68.2 years  across  the  treatment  groups,  with  the 
majority  of  patients  (60.0% overall)  over  the  age  of  65 years.  Of  the  205 patients  in  the  safety 
population, 191 had a del 5q (31 to 33) chromosomal abnormality and 4 patients did  not; these 
demographic data were missing for 10 patients. The majority of patients were in the IPSS MDS 
low and INT-1 risk groups (70 and 74 patients overall, respectively). In addition, the majority of 
patients had or presented with RA based on central review for FAB classification, with comparable 
percentages across treatment groups. The median transfusion burden was 6 units/8 weeks in all 3 
treatment groups.

Across the three treatment groups, there was significant comorbidity (see Table 14.1.4, MDS-004 
CSR), which included a history of hypertension (20.3% to 27.5%), osteoarthritis (8.7% to 13.4%), 
hypercholesterolaemia (7.2% to 11.6%), constipation (5.8% to 10.4%) and atrial fibrillation (8.7% 
to 10.1%).
The mean duration of exposure was comparable across the lenalidomide groups and slightly lower 
in  the  placebo  group (including  the  patients  who  crossed  over to  lenalidomide; Table  2.3.6-4), 
which is consistent with the smaller proportion of patients in the placebo group continuing with 
treatment beyond 24 weeks. Of note, the study design stipulated that patients with no evidence of 
at least a minor erythroid response after 16 weeks double-blind treatment were to be discontinued 
from the double-blind phase and if they had received placebo treatment could enter the open-label 
phase.
The median daily dose of lenalidomide received per cycle for the first 6 cycles ranged from 5.0 mg 
to 2.5 mg in the 5 mg group and from 10.0 mg to 5.0 mg in the 10 mg group, and was consistently 
higher  in  the  10 mg  group.  The  respective  median  daily  doses  remained  stable  through

Clinical Studies in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Study CC-5013-MCL-002
A  total  of  254  patients  were  enrolled  and  randomised  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  the  lenalidomide  arm 
(n = 170) or the control arm (n = 84). Of all patients randomised, 250 (98.4%) received at least 
1 dose of study medication, either lenalidomide (n = 167; 98.2%) or Investigator’s choice (n = 83; 
98.8%).  The  mean  and  median  treatment  duration  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  were  46.6  and 
24.3 weeks,  respectively,  and  ranged  from  0.4  to  241.9  weeks  as  of  the  data  cutoff  date 
07 Mar 2014 (1 year after the last patient was randomised). The proportion of patients on study in 
the  2  treatment  arms  was  comparable  over  time,  with  > 40%  of  patients  remaining  on  study 
for ≥ 80 weeks (≥ 18.5 months) in each arm. Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients 
are summarised in Table 2.3.7-1, while duration of exposure to study medication is presented in
Table 2.3.7-2. 
The  majority  of  the  safety  population  (67.6%)  were  elderly  patients  (≥  65  years  old),  and  the 
median age was 68.5 years. Overall, the study included more men (73.6%) than women (26.4%), 
in line with distribution of the disease by sex (2.3:1) in Europe (Sant, 2010). Most patients were 
white or Caucasian (95.2%); race was not reported in the remaining patients (4.8%). Overall, no 
clinically meaningful differences in demographic characteristics were observed between treatment 
arms. Review of baseline disease characteristics showed that, in general, patients had advanced 
relapses, as evidenced by a median of 2 prior systemic anti-lymphoma therapies and a significant 
number of patients with 2 or more prior relapses.

received lenalidomide at 
doses as low as 0.5 
mg/kg/day on gestational

It is unknown if lenalidomide 
is secreted in human milk. 
There is a potential for 
adverse reactions in nursing

Pregnant and lactating 
females are excluded to avoid 
potential harm to the unborn 
fetus or breastfeeding

IMiD drugs exert various 
effects on the immune 
system, altering cytokine 
production, regulating T cell 
costimulation and enhancing 
NK cell cytotoxicity. 
Particularly, IMiDs inhibit 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha, 
playing an important role in 
immune response against 
bacterial and viral infections. 
Moreover, lenalidomide 
causes myelosuppression, 
mainly neutropenia, which is 
an important risk factor for 
infections. In addition, 
patients are at an increased 
risk of lethal infections when 
treated with a combination of 
drugs that have a bone 
marrow suppressive effect.

carcinoma in situ of the 
cervix or breast or incidental 
finding of prostate cancer 
stage T1a or T1b) were 
excluded unless the patient 
had been free of the disease 
for ≥ 5 years, due to the risk 
of SPM. 
Data have shown that 
patients who do not undergo 
thromboprophylaxis, 
especially high risk patients, 
are at a higher risk for 
thromboembolism when 
lenalidomide is given in 
combination with 
dexamethasone.
Patients with conditions 
requiring chronic steroid or 
immunosuppressive 
treatment, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis and lupus, are likely 
to need additional steroid or 
immunosuppressive 
treatments in addition to the 
study treatment 
(lenalidomide in combination 
with dexamethasone or 
prednisone). Chronic steroid 
or immunosuppressive agents 
can compromise the immune 
system even more, thus 
putting the patients at 
increased risk for infections.
Known 
hypersensitivity to 
thalidomide 
A possible cross-reaction 
between lenalidomide and 
thalidomide has been 
reported in the literature. 
No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
Based on the diseases 
treated, the age of the 
target population, and the 
treatment regimens used 
(prior alkylating 
agents/auto ASCT), and 
SPM follow-up in clinical 
trials, SPM is an important 
identified risk. Section 4.4 
of the SmPC includes 
warnings about SPM.
Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
includes a warning to 
minimise all modifiable 
risk factors, to closely 
monitor patients with 
known risk factors, and a 
recommendation for 
prophylactic 
antithrombotics in patients 
with additional risk 
factors.
Experience to date has 
indicated that treatment 
with lenalidomide has 
been well tolerated by 
patients receiving 
physiological and high 
doses of dexamethasone. 
Use of other 
immunosuppressive 
medications in the target 
population is not 
anticipated to lead to an 
increased risk of common 
AEs known to be 
associated with 
lenalidomide.
Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
includes a warning that 
cases of allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity 
reactions have been 
reported in patients treated 
with lenalidomide.

Moderate to severe

No
Approximately 65% to 85% 
of lenalidomide is eliminated 
unchanged through urinary 
excretion in subjects with 
normal renal function. The 
elimination half-life is 
approximately 3 to 5 hours at 
clinical doses (5 to 
50 mg/day). Steady-state 
levels are achieved within 4 
days.
Pharmacokinetic analyses in 
subjects with impaired renal 
function indicate that, as 
renal function decreases, the 
total drug clearance decreases 
proportionally, which is 
reflected by increased AUC. 
The terminal half-life (t1/2,z) 
of lenalidomide was longer 
by approximately 6 to 
12 hours in subjects with 
moderate or worse renal 
insufficiency. However, renal 
insufficiency did not alter the 
oral absorption of 
lenalidomide. The maximum

similar between healthy 
subjects and subjects with 
renal insufficiency.

2.4.2
Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect rare adverse reactions. Patients with FL, 
relapsed or refractory MM, del 5q MDS and MCL have overall a limited survival time meaning 
that the trial programme may be limited in its ability to assess cumulative effects, and those effects 
with a long latency. Furthermore, these patients are, to a great extent, elderly with a limited natural 
life expectancy.
2.4.3
Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programmes
To ensure patient safety, specific populations of patients were excluded from the clinical studies 
(Table 2.4.3-1). Thus, experience in these populations is limited.

Exposure
In  Study  CALGB 100104,  patients  were  required  to  have  CLcr  ≥ 30 mL/min  (after 
ASCT) prior to receiving maintenance therapy. In Study IFM 2005-02, patients were 
required  to  have  serum  creatinine  < 160 μmol/L  before  and  after  ASCT,  and  serum 
creatinine  < 250 μmol/L  during  ASCT.  In  both  TE  NDMM  studies,  there  were  no 
starting  dose  adjustments  based  on  renal  function  specified  for  lenalidomide 
maintenance.  The  majority  of  patients  in  both  studies  had  CLcr  ≥ 50  mL/min  at 
post-ASCT.
In Study CALGB 100104, 3 patients (1.3%) in the lenalidomide arm (no patients in the
placebo arm) and in Study IFM 2005-02, no patients in the lenalidomide arm and only 
one  patient  in  the  placebo  arm  (0.4%)  had  severe  renal  insufficiency  (CLcr 
< 30 mL/min) post-ASCT. The proportions of patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CLcr  ≥  30  mL/min  to <  50 mL/min)  were  8.5% and 6.3%  in  the lenalidomide and 
placebo  arms  of  Study CALGB 100104,  respectively,  and  3.1%  and  2.5%  in  the 
lenalidomide and placebo arms of Study IFM 2005-02, respectively.
TNE NDMM studies 
In Study SWOG S0777, patients were required to have a calculated or measured CLcr 
> 30 cc/min.  Across  both  arms  (RVd  and  Rd),  approximately  70%  of  patients  had 
baseline  creatinine  values  of  ≥ 60 mL/min,  while  30%  entered  with  a  baseline 
creatinine  value  of  < 60  mL/min  and  17.7%  of  patients  entered  had  a  CLcr  <  50 
mL/min.
Approximately half of patients enrolled in TNE NDMM Studies MM-020 and MM-
015 had some degree of renal insufficiency (CLcr < 60 mL/min).
RRMM studies 
In  Study  MM-009,  22.4%  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  had  relevant  medical 
history/concomitant disease in the renal and urinary disorder system organ class (SOC). 
In  Study  MM-010,  12.5%  of  patients  in  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  arm  and 
14.9%  of  patients  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  arm  had  relevant  medical 
history/concomitant disease in the renal and urinary disorder SOC.
MDS studies
In total, 17.6% of patients in Study MDS-003, and 11.6%, 5.8% and 6.0% of patients 
in the lenalidomide 10 mg, 5 mg and placebo groups, respectively, in Study MDS-004 
had  relevant  medical  history/concomitant  disease  in  the  renal  and  urinary  disorder 
SOC. 
MCL studies
Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (CLcr  < 30 mL/min)  were  excluded  from  the 
clinical studies in MCL. In Study MCL-002, 77.6% of all enrolled patients had normal 
renal function or mild renal impairment at baseline whereas 21.7% had moderate renal 
impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CLcr < 60 mL/min).
PK study
A multi-centre study (CC-5013-PK-001) has been performed with lenalidomide 25 mg 
daily as a single oral dose in 5 groups of patients (total 30 patients) with non-malignant 
conditions  and  defined  by  renal  function  (normal,  mild  impairment,  moderate 
impairment, severe impairment and end-stage renal disease).
Dose adjustment for patients with moderate or severe impaired renal function or end 
stage renal disease are provided in Section 4.2 the SmPC.

presented with a high lactate dehydrogenase value (> 280 IU/L). 
In general, patients in Study MM-020 had advanced-stage disease: of the total study 
population, 40.6% had ISS Stage III, 9.1% had severe renal insufficiency (CLcr < 30 
mL/min), 71.2% had a history of bone disease, and 13.5% had radiation for MM prior 
to treatment in the study. About a third (33.5%) of the study patients had cytogenetic 
profiles  associated  with  adverse  risk  (defined  as  t[4;14],  t[14;16],  del[13q]  or 
monosomy 13, del[17p], or 1q gain), while 18.3% of patients overall presented with

Participants in Studies MM-009 and MM-010 had a history of disease progression after 
at least one prior antimyeloma regimen (with at least 2 cycles of treatment), measurable 
levels  of  serum  (> 0.5 mg/dL)  and  urine  (≥ 0.2 g  excreted  in  a  24  hour  collection 
sample)  M-paraprotein,  and  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance  status  of  0,  1  or  2.  The  majority  of  patients  had  Stage  II  or  III  MM; 
however, a small but comparable proportion of patients in each treatment group of both
studies had  Stage I  disease (1.8%  and  6.3% in  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm 
versus  2.3%  and  4.6%  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  arm  of  Studies MM-009  and 
MM-010, respectively). 
MDS studies 
In  Study MDS-003,  all  148  patients  had  a  del  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality,  and  the 
majority had low or INT-1-risk MDS (118/148; 79.7%). Seven (4.7%) and two (1.4%) 
patients  had  INT-2  and  high-risk  MDS,  respectively.  In  Study MDS-004,  93.2%  of 
patients  overall  had  a  del  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality,  and  the  majority  had  low  or 
INT-1-risk MDS (144/205; 70.2%). Ten (4.9%) patients overall had INT-2 risk-MDS, 
and a single patient in the lenalidomide 10 mg group had high-risk MDS. IPSS score 
was missing for 50 of the 205 patients (24.4%). Therefore, limited data are available
for the use of lenalidomide in the higher risk group. It should be noted that patients 
with INT-2 and high-risk MDS have a poor prognosis, with median survival durations 
of 1.2 and 0.4 years, respectively.81
MCL studies 
In Study MCL-002, patients generally had advanced stage disease: 91.3% of all patients 
randomised had MCL Stage III or IV at diagnosis. Furthermore, 33.5% of patients had 
high-risk  Mantle  cell  lymphoma  International  Prognostic  Index  (MIPI)  score  at 
baseline, 42.9% had high tumour burden at baseline, and 19.7% had bulky disease. For 
79 patients, data on bone marrow were available at baseline. For 34 (43.0%) of these 
patients, disease involvement in the bone marrow was positive (ie, the biopsy showed 
unequivocal cytologic or architectural evidence of malignancy). Few patients (15.0%) 
had an ECOG performance score of 2 at baseline. Patients with ECOG performance 
scores of 3 or 4 were excluded.
The  PK  and  safety  of  lenalidomide  were  compared  between  healthy  Japanese  and 
Caucasian  subjects  in  a  Phase  1,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
single-dose  study.  The  concentration-time  profiles  for  the  Japanese  and  Caucasian 
subjects were similar at all 3 lenalidomide dose levels (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg). There 
were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the PK parameters between 
Japanese and Caucasian subjects at each dose level. Cmax and AUC extrapolated to 
time infinity increased proportionally  with doses  from 5 mg to 20 mg in both ethnic 
groups. No ethnicity-related trends were observed in AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs, and ECGs.
In  Study  NHL-007,  patients  were  predominantly  white  with  90 (61.6%)  and 
92 (62.2%) white FL patients receiving treatment with lenalidomide plus rituximab and 
rituximab plus placebo, respectively. In Study NHL-008, 164 (92.7%) FL patients who 
received lenalidomide plus rituximab were white.
In  the  TE  NDMM  Study  CALGB 100104,  patients  were  predominantly  of  white  or 
Caucasian race with 169 (75.4%) and 167 (75.6%) white/Caucasian patients receiving 
maintenance treatment with lenalidomide and placebo, respectively. Data on race were 
not collected in Study IFM 2005-02.

MM-020, and the majority of patients were of  white or Caucasian (98.7%) race and 
non-Hispanic or Latino (99.8%) ethnicity in Study MM-015. 
In  the  RRMM  studies  performed  in  the  USA,  Canada,  Australia,  Europe,  Israel  and

Lenalidomide is not metabolised by the CYP enzymes. Genetic polymorphisms have 
not been studied in the lenalidomide clinical trial population.
A tumour protein (TP) 53 mutation is present in approximately 20% to 25% of lower-
risk MDS del 5q patients and is associated with a higher risk of progression to AML. 
In  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  a  clinical  trial  of  Revlimid  in  low- or  INT-1-risk  MDS 
(Study MDS-004),  the  estimated  2-year  rate  of  progression  to  AML  was  27.5%  in 
patients  with  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)-p53  positivity  and  3.6% in  patients  with 
IHC-p53 negativity (p = 0.0038) (SmPC, Sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Paediatric Population:
Lenalidomide is not authorised for use in children in the EU/EEA or elsewhere in the 
world.  Class  waivers  for  MM  and  all  mature  B  cell  neoplasms  in  paediatrics  and 
product-specific waivers for MCL, MDS and all mature B cell neoplasms in paediatrics 
have been granted by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the EMA (Decision dated 
04 Oct 2017).
There is limited experience with lenalidomide from investigator-initiated trials (IITs) 
in children. Lenalidomide should not be used in the paediatric age group (0 to 17 years) 
outside of a clinical trial.
Data for cumulative paediatric exposure in the EU/EEA Member States from product 
launch to 26 Dec 2017 (where such data are available) are presented in Section 2.5.1. 
The cumulative paediatric commercial exposure for lenalidomide is 257 patients as of 
26 Dec 2017. In total, 17 paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory AML were treated 
with  lenalidomide  in  the  BMS-sponsored  Study CC-5013-AML-002,  which  was

Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The cumulative value for exposure represents the estimated number of unique patients exposed to 
the product from 27-Dec-2005 through 26-Dec-2020. The application for estimating commercial 
patient exposure has been enhanced since 07-Feb-2019 to represent more accurate sales data.
The methodology for estimating commercial patient exposure utilizes up to 3 data sources:
1) BMS’s  Sales/Shipment  Data  – this  data  consists  of  all  shipments  of  BMS  product  to  all
applicable countries and includes commercial and free-of-charge units for both branded and
generic product (as applicable). The data are used to determine the units (eg, milligrams) of a
product that were sold to a geography to estimate the number of patients who would have been
exposed to that product, based on expected dosing in the geography. Shipment data are used
to estimate the active patients for a period of time by dividing the total units sold by the average
units per patient (note that average units per patient is derived from epidemiologic and market
research).
2) Claims Data – these data consist of 2 distinct sources of electronic health care claims data in
the USA: Optum Clinformatics Datamart and Symphony  Claims  for Hem/Onc. Claims data
consisting  of  distinct  patient  IDs  and  prescription  fill  rates  for  each  product  are  used  to
understand  usage  patterns.  For  newly  approved  products,  until  sufficient  claims  data  are
available, patterns are based on discontinuation rates derived from clinical trial experience.
3) Controlled  Distribution  Database  – this  data  source  provides  detailed  patient  exposure
including demographics, indication for use, and dosing information in the USA.

Exposure within the EU/EEA Member States
As of 26 Dec 2020, lenalidomide has been approved in 31 EU/EEA Member States and the UK: 
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, 
Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands 
and the UK.112
Of  the  EU/EEA  Member  States  and  the  UK  which  have  launched,  information  regarding  off-
label- use is available for 23 countries (Table 2.5.1.3-1 to Table 2.5.1.3-4) due to the implemented 
controlled access programme. It should be noted that the methodology for monitoring offlabel- use 
varies per country, as does the level of detail which can currently be collected. 
Factors  which  may  determine  the  methodology  agreed  with  the  NCA  to  monitor  off-label  use 
include local healthcare systems, the role of the physician/pharmacy in the local PPP process and 
the local prescription process. It is not always possible to obtain information on the postmarketing 
use of lenalidomide by indication in all EU/EEA Member States. Similarly, it is not possible to 
obtain patient demographic information, including the childbearing status of the patient, in most 
Member States. 
In some Member States, it is not possible for the MAH to hold specific information which links a 
specific patient to identifiable information such as demographics, childbearing potential status or 
indication. In some countries it is considered unacceptable by both the patient and the physician 
for the pharmacist to hold sensitive information such as childbearing potential status or indication,

as the order will go directly from the pharmacist to the distributor, the pharmacist will not be able 
to  provide  this  level  of  information  with  an  order.  Due  to  these  considerations,  the  MAH  has 
worked with each NCA to come to an agreement as to how monitoring of off-label use will  be 
evaluated.
As a result, in some Member States the data represents all market exposure, whereas in others a 
sample has been taken either through a pharmacy self-audit process or survey in order to give an 
estimation of the proportion of off-label use. In some Member States it has been possible to identify 
unique patients and hence provide exposure data in terms of patient numbers.
Data on EU/EEA Member States and the UK as pertains to cumulative exposure up to 26 Dec 2020
in adults, FCBP, and paediatric use (where such data are available) are presented in Table 2.5.1.3-
1 and Table 2.5.1.3-2. In the EU/EEA Member States and the UK, the most common indications 
for  which  lenalidomide  has  been  used  up  to  26 Dec 2020 are  presented  in  Table  2.5.1.3-3 and
Table 2.5.1.3-4. Comparisons should be treated with caution, however, as in some cases the data 
are derived from all patients exposed and in other cases from a sample.

Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
Lenalidomide has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance 
or physical dependence. Based on its pharmacological properties, there is no anticipated risk of 
abuse or misuse for illegal purposes. To date, no safety signal has been identified relating to the 
misuse or abuse of lenalidomide.

dysgeusia,  lethargy,  tinnitus  and  dizziness,  muscle  spasms,  bone  pain,  musculoskeletal  pain 
(including back pain and pain in extremity) and connective tissue pain and discomfort, arthralgia,

sweats,  skin  discoloration,  photosensitivity  reaction,  decreased  appetite,  weight  decreased, 
C-reactive protein increased, hypomagnesemia, iron overload, and low grade hypertension. 
Adverse  reactions  such  as  low  grade  blurred  vision,  reduced  visual  acuity,  deafness,  erectile 
dysfunction and higher grades of cataract and depression could have an impact on the quality of 
life; however, the clinical impact of these reactions is considered minimal in relation to the severity 
of the underlying life-threatening malignancy being treated. Other reactions such as haemolysis, 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, acquired hemophilia, acquired fanconi syndrome, somnolence, 
hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are not considered important because only low grades were 
reported  with  the  lenalidomide  treatment  group.  Low  grade  events  are  not  considered  to  have 
significant impact on the benefit-risk profile of lenalidomide in the target population.
Adverse  reactions  of  higher  grade  with  acceptable  clinical  impact  on  patients  treated  for 
life-threating  oncologic  diseases  include  renal  tubular  necrosis,  gout,  vasculitis,  ischaemia, 
peripheral  ischaemia,  hemolytic  anaemia,  hypokalaemia,  hypocalcaemia,  hyperglycaemia, 
hyperuricaemia,  hypophosphataemia,  dehydration,  syncope,  rhabdomyolysis,  pancreatitis, 
gastrointestinal  perforations  (including  diverticular,  intestinal  and  large  intestine  perforations), 
diabetes  mellitus,  hypotension,  and  respiratory  distress.  Some  of  the  above  reactions  may  have 
serious consequences but occur with a  low frequency, such as rhabdomyolysis. These reactions 
are not considered to impact the benefit-risk profile of lenalidomide in the target population. The 
most  current  product  information  does  not  advise  on  specific  clinical  actions  to  be  taken  to 
minimise the risk and no additional risk minimisation measures are in place for these reactions. 
They  are not considered to be  important for the target population. These  ADRs are  included  in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Haematological  toxicities  such  as  febrile  neutropenia,  anaemia,  leucopenia,  lymphopenia,  and 
pancytopenia are already well known to HCPs. The HCPs have appropriate measures in place as 
part of  routine  clinical  practice  for  prevention  and treatment of  these  haematological  toxicities. 
These reactions are included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Risk-Benefit Impact
Lenalidomide  is  a  chemical  analogue  of  thalidomide,  a  known  human 
teratogen  that  causes  severe  life-threatening  birth  defects.  In  addition, 
lenalidomide  induced  malformations  in  the  offspring  of  pregnant 
monkeys similar to those described with thalidomide. If lenalidomide is 
taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans 
is expected.
Please see Section 2.7.3.1 for further details.
Lenalidomide  is  contraindicated  in  pregnant  women.  Lenalidomide  is 
subject  to  controlled  access  due  to  potential  off-label  use  to  treat 
malignancies  in  younger  populations  than  the  target  population,  and 
FCBP have to meet all the conditions of the PPP, which is intended to 
prevent the risk of embryofoetal exposure and thus reduce the potential 
teratogenic effects of lenalidomide exposure. 
The  teratogenic  effects  in  humans  can  be  potentially  serious  or 
life-threatening to the foetus or unborn baby.

The  combination  of  lenalidomide  with  dexamethasone  in  NDMM 
patients  is  associated  with  a  lower  frequency  of  Grade  4  neutropenia 
compared with MPT.
In patients treated with lenalidomide in Study IFM 2005-02, of the 14.1% 
of  patients  with  ≥ Grade  3  infection,  only  one-fourth  (25.6%)  of  the 
patients had concurrent neutropenia and both of the patients (0.7%) who 
had ≥ Grade 4 infection had concurrent neutropenia (IFM 2005-02 CSR, 
Table 14.3-60 and Table 14.3-62). 
The  combination  of  lenalidomide  with  melphalan  and  prednisone in 
NDMM  patients  is  associated  with  a  higher  frequency  of  Grade  4 
neutropenia  compared  with  MPp+p.  There  was  a  higher  frequency  of 
Grade 4 febrile neutropenia observed.

was 0.00 to 0.16 per 100 person-years and the incidence rate of solid 
tumour SPM 0.21 to 1.04 per 100 person-years.
In  clinical  trials  of  newly  diagnosed  MM  patients  not  eligible  for 
transplant,  a  4.9-fold  increase  in  incidence  rate  of  haematologic  SPM 
(cases  of  AML,  MDS)  has  been  observed  in  patients  receiving 
lenalidomide  in  combination  with melphalan  and  prednisone  until

In  Study  NHL-007,  the  proportion  of  FL  patients  experiencing at  least 
one  TFR  event  was  higher  among  lenalidomide  plus  rituximab-treated 
patients  than  patients  treated  with  rituximab  plus  placebo  (risk 
ratio = 19.3  [95%  CI:  2.6-143.9]).  Tumour  flare  reaction  AEs  were 
reported  for  7 
in 
Study NHL-008. In pooled Studies NHL-007 and NHL-008, TFR SAEs 
were  reported  for  2/323  (0.6%)  lenalidomide  plus  rituximab-treated 
patients, both of which resolved. No TFR SAEs had an outcome of death. 
Less than 2% of lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patients experienced 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs of TFR and TFR AEs leading to dose interruption. No 
patients  experienced  TFR  AEs  leading  to  dose  discontinuation  or 
reduction.
TFR has been reported in MCL patients receiving lenalidomide. In Study 
MCL-002,  approximately  10%  of 
lenalidomide-treated  patients 
experienced TFR compared with 0% in the control arm. The majority of 
the events occurred in Cycle 1, all were assessed as treatment-related, and 
the majority of the reports were Grade 1 or 2. Patients with high MIPI at 
diagnosis  or  bulky  disease  (at  least  one  lesion  ≥ 7 cm  in  the  longest 
diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. A Postauthorisation Safety 
Study (PASS) is being carried out to quantify and characterise the event 
of TFR by tumour burden and the proportion of early deaths by tumour 
burden  in  RRMCL  patients  receiving  lenalidomide  in  a  ‘real  world’ 
setting.
Please see Section 2.7.3.1 for further details.
In Study NHL-007, no cardiac failure events occurred in the lenalidomide 
plus rituximab arm. In Study NHL-008, cardiac failure AEs were reported 
in  one  (0.6%)  lenalidomide  plus  rituximab-treated  patient.  In  Studies 
NHL-007 and NHL-008, no cardiac failure SAEs were reported and no 
patients died due to an event of cardiac failure.
Cardiac failure events occurred at a similar frequency in Arm MPT and 
Arm  Rd18  (5.0%  and  5.2%,  respectively)  but  occurred  with  higher 
frequency  in  Arm  Rd  (8.8%)  in  TNE  NDMM  Study MM-020.  When 
adjusted  for  treatment  duration,  the  incidence  of  events  was  similar 
between Arm Rd (6.19 events per 100 PY,) Arm Rd18 (5.62), and Arm 
MPT (6.19). The incidence rate of events was highest and similar across 
arms during the first 6 months of treatment indicating that more events 
occurred  in  the  first  6 months  of  treatment.  Deaths  due  to  cardiac 
disorders on study treatment were low and similar in Arms Rd, Rd18 and 
MPT.  A  PASS  is  being  conducted  to  further  characterise  this  safety 
concern in the recently added target population of TNE NDMM patients

patient  in  this  study  died  due  to an  event  of  cardiac  arrhythmia 
(PT: cardio-respiratory arrest).
Cardiac  arrhythmia  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  Arm  Rd 
compared  with  Arm  Rd18 and  MPT  (25.0%  versus  17.4% and  22.7%, 
respectively)  in  TNE  NDMM  Study MM-020.  When  adjusted  for 
treatment duration, the incidence of events was higher in Arm MPT than 
Arm Rd and Arm Rd18. Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmias and SAEs of 
cardiac  arrhythmias  also  occurred  with  generally  similar  frequencies 
across all arms. A PASS is being conducted to further characterise this 
safety  concern  by  investigating  the  incidence  and  mortality  associated

lenalidomide, particularly in those with known risk factors. The overall 
frequency  of  myocardial  infarction/ischaemic  heart  disease  (MI/IHD)

MM-020,  an  imbalance  in  the  incidence  of  MI/IHD  between  the  two 
lenalidomide-containing arms (Rd/Rd18)  was  observed  during  the  first 
6 months of treatment. Further investigation into the potential risk factors 
for MI/IHD did not yield an explanation for the difference in frequency 
of  MI/IHD  between  arms  with  identical  treatment  during  the  first 
6 months  of  the  study.  Therefore,  such  a  difference  may  have  resulted 
from  unmeasured  confounders  before  or after  baseline, or  due  to  some 
combination  of  different  risk  factors  that  have  not  yet  been  fully 
understood. Fatal outcomes have been observed although these were of 
low  frequency.  A  PASS  is  being  conducted to  further  characterise  this 
safety  concern  by  investigating  the  incidence  and  mortality  associated 
with cardiovascular events and to utilise extensive risk factor information

Disease (Including Myocardial Infarction) were defined in MedDRA Versions 5.1 and/or 11.0.
In Section 2.7.3.1, the definition of “risk” of each event of interest is based on cumulative incidence 
(ie, the proportion of patients experiencing each event, or group of events), and also relative risk, 
where indicated. 
SPM Search Strategy
A search for SPM from the clinical and safety databases was performed by retrieving and manually 
reviewing  all  MedDRA  PTs  in  the  Neoplasms  Benign,  Malignant,  and  Unspecified  (Including 
Cysts and Polyps) SOC. Events deemed to not represent an SPM were excluded. Thus, events in 
the high level group terms (HLGTs) of metastases and neoplasm-related morbidities (eg, tumour 
96

lysis syndrome, tumour flare, and cancer pain); reports of most neoplasms clearly identifiable as 
benign except for meningioma, which was considered to be a solid tumour malignancy because 
the  clinical  course  is  not  benign;  events  of  disease  progression  of  the  underlying  indication 
(eg, MM in a study  investigating treatment for MM); and reports of pre-existing SPM were not 
included as SPM events in presentations or analyses in this RMP.
Data Collection
TEAEs:
Typically all AEs in BMS-sponsored clinical studies are collected for 28 days post discontinuation 
of active treatment and 30 days post discontinuation of active treatment in the cooperative studies 
(CALGB 100104, IFM 2005-02 and RVd study SWOG S0777).
SPM:
Collection of SPM in clinical trials is continuing for the duration of the studies, from the time of 
signing the Informed Consent Document up to the time all patients have been followed for at least 
5 years (a maximum of 6 years for SWOG S0777) from randomisation or have died. Due to the 
long-term nature of the SPM data collection and the different follow up times in the studies, these 
events are better understood through incidence rates rather than frequency only. For this reason, 
both frequencies and incidence rates have been included for the SPM risk assessment. For each 
SPM category, the incidence rate per 100 person-years was calculated as: (the number of patients 
with any SPM in the SPM category/total person-years)*100.
Data Presentation
It is important to note that pooling across indications (TE and TNE NDMM, RRMM, MDS, MCL 
and FL) for this section was not performed because of the basic differences in the pathophysiology 
of  the  indications,  patient  populations,  treatment  regimens,  dose/dose  intensity  and  schedules 
(cycle length) and route of administration across the indications. Treatment regimen for RVd as 
initial treatment in NDMM: 25 mg lenalidomide QD orally on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle for 
up  to  eight  3-week  cycles  with  1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib  IV  on  Days 1,  4,  8  and  11  and  20 mg 
dexamethasone QD orally on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 (SWOG S0777); lenalidomide 25 mg 
QD orally 21/28 days cyclic regimen with dexamethasone or lenalidomide 10 mg QD orally 21/28 
days  cyclic  regimen  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  induction  followed  by  lenalidomide 
maintenance  with  10 mg  QD  orally  21/28 days  cyclic  regimen  for  TNE  NDMM;  lenalidomide 
maintenance  10 mg QD  orally  28/28 days  continuous  regimen  for  TE  NDMM;  lenalidomide 
25 mg QD orally 21/28 days cyclic regimen for RRMM, and lenalidomide 10 mg QD orally 21/28 
days cyclic regimen, 10 mg QD orally 28/28 days cyclic regimen or 5 mg QD orally 28/28 days 
continuous regimen for MDS. 
Pooling of Studies
Pooling was not performed for the MM indication primarily due to the different patient populations 
(TE versus TNE), disease setting, study designs, study treatment regimen (monotherapy, doublet 
versus triplet), dose/dose intensity and cycle length:

lenalidomide


In  TE  NDMM  Study CALGB  100104,  patients  received  maintenance  treatment  with  either 
lenalidomide  or  placebo  until  disease  progression.  The  starting  dose  of  lenalidomide  was 
10 mg/day for the first 3 months, increased to 15 mg/day if tolerated. A conservative approach 
was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The adverse reactions 
included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events from the maintenance treatment 
period.
In  TE  NDMM  Study IFM  2005-02,  patients  received  maintenance  treatment  with  either 
lenalidomide or placebo until relapse. The starting dose of lenalidomide was 10 mg/day for the 
first  3  months,  increased  to  15 mg  if  tolerated. With  the  exception  of  the  SPM  risks  (SPM 
safety analysis population), data are presented for the maintenance period only in Study IFM 
2005-02, and include AEs reported during the start of the maintenance period.
 The TNE RVd NDMM Study SWOG S0777 compared initial (induction) treatment with RVd 
versus Rd followed by continued Rd for all patients. 
 The  TNE  NDMM  Study MM-020  compared  3 regimens:  lenalidomide  with  low-dose 
dexamethasone given until disease progression (Rd), or Rd given for eighteen 28-day cycles 
(Rd18 = 72 weeks); versus MPT given for twelve 6-week cycles (72 weeks). 
 The TNE NDMM Study MM-015 compared the combination of melphalan/prednisone with or 
without lenalidomide during 9 cycles of induction followed by a maintenance phase comparing 
lenalidomide with placebo.
Pooling within the MDS indication (MDS-003 and MDS-004 studies), was not done because of 
the differences  in the duration of exposure to lenalidomide and dosing. The median duration of 
exposure was 52.5 weeks for the 10 mg dose in MDS-003, and 50.3 weeks for the 10 mg dose, 
18 weeks  for the  5 mg  dose,  and  16  weeks  for the  placebo  arm  in  MDS-004.  Unless  otherwise 
indicated,  the  data  presented  from  Study MDS-004  are  from  the  double-blind  phase  (N = 69 
patients each in the 10 mg and 5 mg lenalidomide groups; N = 67 in the placebo group), and so do 
not  include  open-label  phase  results  (during  which  placebo-treated  patients  could  cross over  to 
lenalidomide  5 mg)  or  the  follow-up  phase  of  Study MDS-004.  The  double-blind  phase  was 
52 weeks including the first 16 weeks of which the patients in the placebo arm who did not achieve 
a minor response by Week 16 were given the option to cross over to the 5 mg lenalidomide arm. 
Details of the clinical study design for MDS-003 and MDS-004 are found in Section 2.3.
It is worth noting that in Study MCL-002, as of the 07 Mar 2014 data cutoff, the median treatment 
duration  in the lenalidomide arm (24.3 weeks; range: 0.4, 241.9) was longer than  in the control 
arm (13.1 weeks; range: 0.1, 157.9). This longer time on treatment was partially due to the fact 
that  three  of  the  investigator’s  choice  drugs  in  the  control  arm  (cytarabine,  gemcitabine  and 
fludarabine) were administered up to a maximum of 6 cycles (per protocol, based on standard of 
care), while lenalidomide was administered until PD or unacceptable toxicity.

Characterization of risk 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to cause serious 
birth  defects  and  death  of  the  foetus.  In  nonclinical  studies,  lenalidomide  induced 
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide. Therefore, a teratogenic 
effect  of  lenalidomide  is  expected  and  lenalidomide  is  contraindicated  during 
pregnancy.

were in female patients receiving lenalidomide and 8 pregnancies were in the female 
partners of male patients receiving lenalidomide. Two of the 5 reports of pregnancy 
in female patients on lenalidomide arose from a BMS-sponsored study for complex 
regional  pain  syndrome.  The  remaining  3  reports  in  female  patients  receiving 
lenalidomide were from investigator-led studies (two in MM and one in Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma).  Of  the  8  reports  of  pregnancy  in  the  female  partner  of  a  male  patient 
receiving lenalidomide, two reports arose from a BMS-sponsored study for complex 
regional pain syndrome, two reports arose from an investigator-led study in MM and 
one  report  arose  from  an  investigator-led  study  in  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia 
(CLL).  The  remaining  3  reports  of  pregnancy  in  female  partners  of  male  patients 
receiving lenalidomide were in a follicular lymphoma study.
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The ‘at risk’ group comprises FCBP or female partners of male patients treated with 
lenalidomide and there are no risk factors.
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Public health impact
To avoid any risk of foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the drug is contraindicated in 
women who are pregnant and in FCBP unless all of the conditions of the PPP are met 
(SmPC,  Section 4.3).  Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  use  an  effective 
method  of  contraception  (SmPC,  Sections  4.4  and  4.6).  Male  patients  taking 
lenalidomide  should  use  condoms  throughout  treatment  duration,  during  dose 
interruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or 
of childbearing potential and not using effective contraception, even if the man has 
had  a  vasectomy  (SmPC,  Sections  4.4  and  4.6)  and  should  not  donate  semen 
throughout treatment duration, during dose interruption and for 1 week after cessation 
of  treatment.  It  is  not  known  whether  lenalidomide  is  excreted  in  human  milk. 
Therefore,  breastfeeding  should  be  discontinued  during  therapy  with  lenalidomide 
(SmPC, Section 4.6).
Lenalidomide  is  structurally  related  to  thalidomide,  a  known  human  teratogen, 
inducing  a high  frequency  (about  30%)  of  severe  and life-threatening  birth  defects 
such  as:  ectromelia  (amelia,  phocomelia,  haemimelia)  of  the  upper  and/or  lower 
extremities,  microtia  with  abnormality  of  the  external  acoustic  meatus  (blind  or 
absent), middle and internal ear lesions (less frequent), ocular lesions (anophthalmia, 
microphthalmia), congenital heart disease and renal abnormalities.
Potentially severe or life-threatening defects/disability, or foetal death.
Lenalidomide is an analogue of a known human teratogenic compound. It was shown 
to be  present  in  the  semen  of  healthy  male  subjects  in  Phase  1  studies  and  a 
developmental  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  indicated  that  lenalidomide  produced

malformations in the monkeys’ offspring. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, 
a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected (SmPC, Sections 4.4, 4.6 
and 4.8).

Overall, in pooled Studies NHL-007 and NHL-008, neutropenia AEs were reported 
for 148 lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patients and infection AEs were reported 
for 182 lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patients.
In Study NHL-007, the proportion of FL patients experiencing at least one neutropenia 
event  was  higher  among lenalidomide  plus  rituximab-treated  patients  than  patients 
treated  with  rituximab  plus  placebo  (risk  ratio = 2.6  [95% CI:  1.7  to  3.9]).  The 
proportion of FL patients experiencing at least one infection event was higher among 
lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patients than patients treated with rituximab plus 
placebo (risk ratio = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.0 to 1.9]). 
In  Study  NHL-008,  35.6% and 50.8%  FL  patients  who received  lenalidomide  plus 
rituximab experienced at least one AE of neutropenia or infection, respectively.
To further elucidate the relationship between neutropenia and infection, a stratified 
analysis of infection in neutropenic patients was performed.

a Definition of concurrent infection: the start date of any infection is within 2 weeks 
after the start date, but before or on the end date of neutropenia. Neutropenia and 
infection are considered as concurrent if either of them had both missing start and 
end date or both of them had missing start date. Otherwise, if neutropenia start date 
is missing, infection is concurrent if its start date is before neutropenia end date; if 
neutropenia  end date  is missing,  infection  is  considered  as concurrent  if  its  start 
date  is  within  2  weeks  after  the  neutropenia  start  date;  if  infection  start  date  is 
missing, it is considered as concurrent if its end date is on or after the neutropenia 
start date.

among  neutropenic  patients 
Among  neutropenic  patients  in  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  arm,  the  risk  of 
infection  was  82.2% 
the 
placebo/dexamethasone arm, the risk was 73.9% (17/23). The risk ratio contrasting 
infection risk between these two groups was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.86–1.43; p = 0.36).
There were 196 patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm without neutropenia 
and 327 patients in the placebo/dexamethasone arm without neutropenia. The risk of 
infection  within these  two  arms  was  58.2% and  56.0%, respectively.  The risk ratio 
was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.89–1.21; p = 0.63).
The  Breslow-Day  test  for  interaction  of  the  risk  ratio  between  strata  was  0.91 
(p = 0.34),  indicating  no  significant  statistical  difference.  After  controlling  for  the 
effect  of  neutropenia, 
infection  among 
lenalidomide-treated patients (adjusted risk ratio 1.05; 95% CI: 0.92–1.21, p = 0.45). 
However, the greater risk of infection may be understood by the greater proportion of 
patients with neutropenia.

Temporally related infection was defined as infection that occurred within 2 weeks of 
an AE of neutropenia. 
It can be concluded that the risk of infection with lenalidomide is probably related to 
the risk of neutropenia in this population.

In Study MM-020, SAEs of neutropenia were reported more frequently in the MPT 
arm of the study compared with the Rd and Rd18 arms (MPT: 3.9% versus Rd: 3.0%, 
Rd18:  2.2%).  (PTs  were  febrile  neutropenia,  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  sepsis). 
Neutropenia (neutropenic sepsis) was Grade 5 (fatal) in 3 patients: 1 in each treatment 
arm  of  the  study.  In  Study  MM-015,  SAEs  of  neutropenia  were  reported  more 
frequently in the lenalidomide-containing arms of the study (MPR+R: 9.3%; MPR+p: 
3.9%)  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients  (MPp+p:  0.7%).  Among  patients 
receiving induction with melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide, the frequency of 
these events was higher in patients receiving continuous treatment with lenalidomide 
following induction than in patients receiving placebo.

to permanent withdrawal of study treatment in patients treated with placebo.
In Study IFM 2005-02, greater proportions of patients treated with lenalidomide than 
those treated with placebo experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs of neutropenia (53.9% versus

In Study MM-020, more patients in the MPT arm of the study experienced Grade 3 or 
4 neutropenia compared with the Rd and Rd18 arms of the study (MPT: 46.6% versus 
Rd:  28.6% and  Rd18:  27.2%).  Neutropenia  AEs  led  to  lenalidomide  withdrawal  or 
dose reduction for ≤ 2.8% of patients in the lenalidomide treatment arms. In patients 
in Arm MPT, neutropenia AEs led to dose withdrawal in 2.4% of patients and to dose 
reduction in 10.5% of patients. Neutropenia led to dose interruption for 22.4%, 19.3% 
and 49.5% of patients in Arms Rd, Rd18 and MPT, respectively. In Study MM-015, 
more patients in the lenalidomide-containing arms of the study experienced Grade 3

In  Study MCL-002,  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  AEs  were  reported  in  a  greater 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  lenalidomide  group  (46.7%)  than  the  control  group 
(33.7%).  The  proportions  of  patients  with  neutropenia  leading  to  study  treatment 
being permanently withdrawn, or the dose reduced were the same (1.2% and 1.2%) 
and  similar  (7.8%  versus  7.2%),  respectively,  in  both  treatment  groups.  A  greater 
proportion of patients in the lenalidomide group than in the control group experienced 
neutropenia AEs leading to dose interruption (25.1% versus 10.8%, respectively) and 
to dose reduction and interruption (24.6% versus 2.4%). This might be attributed to 
the strict dose-modification protocol requirements and the longer treatment duration 
for the lenalidomide arm compared to the control arm.
In Study MCL-002, Grade 3 or 4 infection AEs were reported in a greater proportion 
of  patients  in  the  lenalidomide  group  (16.2%)  than  the  control  group  (9.6%).  The 
proportions  of  patients  with  infection  AEs  leading  to  study  treatment  being 
permanently  withdrawn  were  similar in  the  lenalidomide and  control  groups (1.2% 
versus  2.4%,  respectively),  whereas  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
lenalidomide group than the control group experienced infection AEs leading to dose 
interruption  (18.6%  versus  7.2%).  The  proportions  of  patients  with  infection  AEs 
leading to dose reduction and interruption were the same (1.2%) in both groups. No 
patients had their dose reduced as a result of infection AEs.
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Haematologic malignancies by themselves or by virtue of their therapeutic strategies, 
chemotherapy, radiation or haematopoietic stem cell transplant put patients at risk of 
infections.113 The introduction of stem cell transplantation and novel anti-myeloma 
agents  has  improved  the  outcome  of  patients  with  MM.  These  advances  have 
transformed  MM  into  a  chronic  condition,  with  multiple  relapses  and  salvage 
therapies, all of  which results in cumulative immunosuppression and higher risk of 
infection.  For  example,  application  of  stem  cell  transplantation  has  broadened  the

the  multisystem 
iron  overload  and  (6) 
cytomegalovirus,  and  opportunistic  moulds.  Risk  factors  include  myeloma-related 
innate  immunodeficiency,  which involves  various  arms  of  the  immune  system  and 
includes  B-cell  dysfunction  (manifested  as  hypogammaglobulinemia).  Polyclonal 
hypogammaglobulinemia  has  been  classically  associated  with 
infection  by 
encapsulated  bacteria,  such  as  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Haemophilus 
influenzae. Myeloma and treatment-associated organ dysfunctions and comorbidities 
also increase the risk of infection. These dysfunctions and comorbidities include (1) 
renal  failure  (cast  nephropathy,  hypercalcemia,  deposition  disease,  and  others), 
respiratory compromise, caused by collapse of thoracic vertebra and opiate therapy 
(which  may  depress  the  central  nervous  system)  given  to  patients  with  painful 
fractures (3) severe alimentary mucosal damage (caused by chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy, or graft-versus-host disease) (4) hyperglycemia induced by dexamethasone 
(5) 
involvement  by 
myeloma-associated  deposition  diseases  (AL-amyloidosis  and  light  chain  deposit 
disease).  Indeed,  levels  of  CD4+  T  cells,  particularly  naive  and  activated  subsets, 
decrease  significantly  with  increasing  cycles  of  chemotherapy,  a  decrease  strongly 
associated with opportunistic infections. Finally, myeloma typically affects an older 
population, with a median age of 62 to 73 years. These patients frequently experience 
an age-related decline in physiologic reserve of various organs and from other age-
related conditions, including frailty, geriatric syndromes, cognitive dysfunction, and 
social isolation, all of which may increase the risk of infection.114
Lenalidomide treatment in combination with dexamethasone in MM patients with at 
least one prior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia 
compared  to  placebo-dexamethasone treated  patients  (SmPC,  Section 4.4).  The 
combination  of  lenalidomide  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  in  clinical  trials  of 
NDMM  patients  is  associated  with a higher  incidence  of  Grade  4 neutropenia than 
MPp+p treated patients (SmPC, Section 4.4).
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  Grade 3  or  4 myelosuppression in  one 
study of lenalidomide-treated patients with MM was significantly higher for patients 
who had prior high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, compared with 
those that did not.115 Impairment of antibody response, neutropenia, treatment with 
glucocorticoids,  and reduction  of normal  Ig  all increase  the  likelihood  of  infection. 
While  a  much  greater  proportion  of 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone  patients 
experienced  neutropenia  relative  to  placebo/dexamethasone  patients,  this  increased 
risk did not translate into an infection risk of the same magnitude in either the total 
study population or in the study population restricted to Grade 3 or 4 toxicities.
Lenalidomide treatment in MDS patients is associated with a higher incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on placebo (SmPC, Section 4.4). In 
patients with MDS, those experiencing neutropenia while receiving lenalidomide 
may be at increased risk for infections.
Preventability 
The major dose-limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia.
Neutropenia  can  be  managed  with  dose  reduction  (Richardson,  2006b).115 Dosing 
recommendations in the event of neutropenia can be found in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The  use  of  growth  factors  in  the  management  of neutropenia  should  be  considered 
(SmPC, Section 4.2 and 4.4).

Hepatitis  B  virus  status  should  be  established  before  initiating  treatment  with 
lenalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a 
physician  with  expertise  in  the  treatment  of  hepatitis  B  is recommended.  Patients 
previously infected with HBV should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms 
of  active  HBV  infection  throughout  therapy  (SmPC,  Section  4.4).  In  patients  with 
repeated infectious complications, long-term administration of antibiotic or antiviral 
medication or use of IV Ig may be recommended (as recommended by Ludwig).117

Important Identified Risk: Second Primary Malignancies
Second primary malignancies are identified risks with the use of lenalidomide particularly when 
lenalidomide is given in combination with oral melphalan or following HDM supported by ASCT 
or after a prior alkylating therapy. The data from NDMM trials suggest there may be an increased 
incidence of invasive SPM, especially haematologic SPM, when lenalidomide or thalidomide are 
given in combination with oral melphalan or as maintenance therapy following HDM supported 
by ASCT. 
The  SPM that  have  been  observed  include  invasive  (haematologic  [AML,  B-cell  malignancies, 
other  haematologic  malignancies]  and  solid  tumours)  and  non-invasive  (non-melanoma  skin

Potential mechanisms 
No mechanism whereby lenalidomide may cause SPM has been identified.
While none of the following may be exclusive there may be several explanations why 
patients with MM might develop secondary haematopoietic and lymphatic cancers, 
including:
 Treatment-related
Change of natural disease history as a result of improved survival in recent years.
As a consequence of the use of alkylating agents

Prolonged immunosuppression (cytopenias).
 Use of G-CSF, especially in combination with high-dose chemotherapy.

 As a consequence of selective reporting
Increased surveillance of cancer patients.

Patients treated with lenalidomide may be at increased risk of developing new 
cancers. The reason for this is not clear, but investigations are being undertaken.
Characterization of risk 
Frequency with 95% CI (Invasive SPM [Haematologic Malignancies])
The frequency of haematologic malignancies is summarised in Table 2.7.3.1-4 for the 
NDMM RVd study, Table 2.7.3.1-5 for the NDMM studies, Table 2.7.3.1-6 for the 
RRMM studies, and Table 2.7.3.1-7 for the MDS and lymphoma studies. The risk of 
SPM  associated  with  lenalidomide  is  dependent  on  tumour  type  and  context.  In 
randomised Phase 3 study NHL-007 in FL, there was no increased risk of SPM for 
lenalidomide plus rituximab compared to rituximab plus placebo.
FL Studies:
Study NHL-007 
AML  was  experienced  by  1  (0.29  events  per  100  person-years) patient in  both  the 
lenalidomide plus rituximab and rituximab plus placebo arms. The AML malignancies 
were PT acute myeloid leukaemia in both patients. No patients in either treatment arm 
experienced MDS, B-cell or other haematologic malignancies. 
Study NHL-008
Other haematologic malignancies were experienced by 1 (0.55 events per 100 person-
years) lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patient. The event of other haematologic 
malignancies was PT leukaemia granulocytic. No lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated 
patients experienced AML, MDS or B-cell malignancies.
NDMM RVd Study
Study SWOG S0777
There were no reports of AML in the RVd and Rd arms of Study SWOG S0777. MDS 
(PT: Myelodysplastic syndrome) was reported in 2 (0.16 events per 100 person-years) 
patients in the RVd arm and 1 (0.09 events per 100 person-years) patient in the Rd 
arm. B-cell malignancies were reported in 2 (0.8 events per 100 person-years) patients 
in the Rd arm (PTs: B-cell type acute leukaemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) 
and  no  patients  in  the  RVd  arm.  There  were  no  reports  of  other  haematologic 
malignancies in the RVd and Rd arms.

placebo group, and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, B precursor type acute leukaemia 
and Hodgkin’s disease, reported in 1 (0.4%) patient each in the lenalidomide group. 
Four patients in both the lenalidomide group and the placebo group experienced MDS 
(0.33 and  0.39  events  per  100  person-years,  respectively).  Other  haematologic 
malignancies were experienced by 1 (0.10 events per 100 person-years) patient in the

For  Study MDS-004,  the  analysis  of  B-cell  malignancies  and  AML  include  the 
double-blind phase of 52 weeks including the first 16 weeks of which the patients in 
the placebo arm who did not achieve a minor response by Week 16 were given the 
option  to  cross  over  to  the  5 mg  lenalidomide  arm.  In  MDS,  AML  is  considered 
disease progression; however, it is also viewed as an important potential risk when 
taking lenalidomide that will be monitored closely.

 Lymphoproliferative disorders in ASCT patients
The  development  of  Post-Transplant  Lymphoproliferative  Disorders  (PTLD)  after 
solid organ transplantation is well recognised.119 Most cases are due to EBV-driven 
tumour  formation  in  B-cells.  Other  important  risks  include  the  use  of  potent  and 
prolonged immunosuppressive medication, the age of donor (in the case of allogenic 
transplantation) and recipient, number and severity of rejection episodes and cytokine 
gene polymorphisms.119 In patients with MM a number of prospective, randomised 
trials have been conducted that compare conventional chemotherapy with high-dose 
therapy  using  ASCT.  As  a  result  of  these  studies,  ASCT  has  nowadays  become  a 
standard of care in MM.120 However, these patients are at risk of developing PTLD. 
Reports  have  demonstrated  that  HSCT  patients  with  PTLD  generally  have  higher 
concentrations  of  EBV  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  in  the  peripheral  blood  than 
patients without PTLD.121
 G-CSF therapy
Guidelines  for  cancer  care  support  the  use  of  G-CSF  prophylaxis  in  specific 
therapeutic  circumstances.122 Despite  the  usefulness  of  G-CSF  therapy,  increased 
risks of AML or MDS associated with G-CSF use have been described. Lyman123
provided a systematic review of AML/MDS incidence among 6058 and 6746 patients 
randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with and without initial G-CSF support 
in  25 randomised  clinical  trials.  At  mean  and  median  follow-up  across  studies  of 
60 and 53 months, respectively, AML/MDS was reported in 22 control patients and 
43 G-CSF patients, for an estimated risk ratio of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.19–3.07). Median 
follow-up time was 54 months.
The risk of AML/MDS was significantly increased in studies where G-CSF use was 
associated with higher total dose of chemotherapy (risk ratio = 2.334; 95% CI: 1.237–
4.403). There was no significant difference in the risk ratio for mortality. Even though 
these findings do not establish a unique causal role associated with the use of G-CSF 
the  median  follow-up  of  about  5 years  may  be  insufficient  to  provide  a  final 
quantification of AML/MDS.
 Heredity
Additional insight has also been obtained in elucidating the risk of malignancies in 
close  family  members  of  patients  affected  by  MM.  The  available  data  show  an 
increased risk of more than one malignancy in MM patients and first-degree relatives 
compared to the general population. The reason for this finding is still unclear but may 
involve risk conferred by shared genetic factors.124,125
MDS Populations (Haematologic Malignancies)
A study to identify prognostic factors for progression to leukaemia (LFS) and OS was 
reported by Malcovati.126 Four hundred seventy six patients first diagnosed with de 
novo MDS between 1992 and 2002 were evaluated. In one of the earliest studies to 
report  the  negative  effects  of  developing  a  transfusion  requirement,  Malcovati

the 
assessed 
risk  of  AML  progression  and  death 
reported  an  increased  risk  associated  with  transfusion  burden  when  analysed  as  a 
time-dependent covariate in a combined group of patients with RA, RARS or MDS 
with del(5q) (HR = 3.46). 
Further development of the WPSS a learning cohort of 426 Italian MDS patients and 
a  validation  cohort  of  193 German  MDS  patients  was  reported  by Malcovati  and 
colleagues.127 In a multivariable  analysis  of  the  Italian  patients  stratified  by  WHO 
subgroups,  cytogenetics  (HR  =  1.48)  and  transfusion  requirement  (HR = 2.53) 
significantly  affected  OS  and risk  of  AML  (HR  =  1.3  and HR  =  2.4, respectively). 
These findings were corroborated in the subsequent multivariable analysis of German 
MDS  patients  stratified  by  WHO  subgroups,  with  cytogenetics  (HR = 1.84)  and 
transfusion dependency  (HR  =  1.85)  and risk  of  AML  (HR  =  2.27 and  HR = 2.25, 
respectively). Mallo128 reported the results of a cooperative study designed to assess 
prognostic factors for OS and progression to AML in 541 patients with de novo MDS 
and  del  5q.  In  multivariate  analyses  the  most  important  predictors  of  both  OS  and 
AML  progression  were  number  of  chromosomal  abnormalities  (p < 0.001  for  both 
outcomes), platelet count (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and proportion of 
bone marrow blasts (p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Transfusion burden was 
not addressed in this study.

in 
295 lenalidomide-treated MDS-003 and MDS-004 patients versus 125 MDS patients 
with del 5q from a large multicentre registry who had received best supportive care 
only  including  ESAs.  In  the  final  multivariate  Cox  proportional  hazard  models, 
lenalidomide  treatment  was  not  associated  with  progression  to  AML  (HR  0.939; 
p = 0.860). Significant factors associated with an increased risk of AML progression 
were complex cytogenetics (del 5q plus > 1 abn; HR 3.627; p = 0.002), bone marrow 
blasts 5% to 10% (HR 2.215; p = 0.016), and higher transfusion burden (HR 1.097 
[10%  increase  in  risk  per  unit  at  baseline];  p = 0.029).  Higher  haemoglobin  levels 
were  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  (HR  0.857;  p =  0.054).  Regarding  survival, 
lenalidomide treatment  was  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  death  (HR  0.597; 
p = 0.012). 
Other  factors  associated  with  decreased  mortality  were  higher  haemoglobin  levels 
(HR 0.883; p = 0.028), higher platelet counts (HR 0.999; p = 0.035), and female sex 
(HR  0.598;  p =  0.002).  Higher  transfusion  burden  (HR  1.056;  p = 0.037)  and  age 
(HR 1.049; p < 0.001) increased the risk of death.
Mutations in the TP53 gene have been well described as a poor prognostic variable 
and  associated  with  chemotherapy  resistance  in  a  wide  variety  of  malignancies 
including high-risk MDS and AML.130,131

Risk  factors  for  NMSC  include:  increased  sun  or  ultraviolet  radiation  exposure; 
physical  factors  such  as  fair  skin, red  or  blond hair, and light  eye  colour;  chemical 
carcinogens such as, arsenic, tobacco, and oral methoxsalen; ionising radiation; and

As previously noted, the 5-year relative survival among MM patients has increased 
from 24.6% among patients first diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 44.9% among patients 
first diagnosed between 2003 and 2009.134
Due  to  improvements  in  the  care  of  patients  with  cancer,  the  number  of  cancer 
survivors has been increasing in recent years. Increased longevity increases the risk 
of developing second malignancy, including NMSC.

Immunosuppression associated with transplantation procedures
is  a  risk  factor  for  NMSC.133,132 Patients  receiving 
Immunosuppression 
immunosuppressive therapy following solid organ transplantation and those receiving 
bone marrow transplants have an increased risk of skin cancer. In a small series of 
patients  (n = 43)  receiving  nonmyeloablated  haematopoietic  cell 
transplants, 
6 patients developed squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), basal cell carcinoma (n = 2), 
or  malignant  melanoma  (n = 2).135 In  another  study,  the  most  frequently  observed 
secondary malignancies among patients (n = 557) receiving allogeneic bone marrow 
transplants  were  NMSC.  Out  of  31  secondary  malignancies,  5  were  basal  cell 
carcinoma and 4 were squamous cell carcinoma skin cancers.136
The  risk  of  occurrence  of  haematologic  SPM  must  be  taken  into  account  before 
initiating  treatment  with  Revlimid  either  in  combination  with  melphalan  or 
immediately  following  HDM  and  ASCT.  Physicians  should  carefully  evaluate 
patients before and during treatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence 
of SPM and institute treatment as indicated (SmPC, Section 4.4). TP53 and the risk 
of progression to AML is mentioned in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.
SPM may result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the type of SPM. 
It impacts the patient’s activities of daily living.
AML and B-cell malignancies may result in an increase in mortality, and adversely 
affect quality of life.
NMSC is rarely fatal but impacts the patient’s activities.
As survival after a diagnosis of cancer improves, identification and quantification of 
the late effects of cancer and its therapy have become critical. Generally, new cancer 
is considered to be one of the most serious events experienced by cancer survivors. 
The  number  of  patients  with  multiple  primary  cancers  is  growing  rapidly,  with 
independent malignancies now comprising about 16% of incident cancers reported to 
the  National  Cancer  Institute’s  (NCI)  SEER  Program  in  2003.  Moreover,  second 
tumours  may  be  a  cause  of  mortality  among  several  populations  of  long-term 
survivors.58 It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  risk  of  dying  from  MM  is
considerably higher than the risk of developing a second cancer.137
NMSC is rarely fatal but has adverse public health effects of high medical cost. The 
total cost of NMSC care in the US in the Medicare population is $426 million/year. 
The average cost per episode of NMSC when performed in a physician’s office setting 
was  found  to  be  $492  and  the  cost  per  episode  of  care  in  inpatient  and  outpatient 
settings were $5537 and $1043, respectively.138

a Median time on treatment was 52.5 weeks.
b For Study MDS-004, the analysis of SPM includes data from the open label phase as well as the double blind phase.
c Patients could cross over to lenalidomide 5 mg after 16 weeks of placebo treatment.
d Survival status is provided for 147 patients because 1 patient in MDS-003 had AML at baseline and is therefore not included in the analysis.
N = number of patients; NA = not applicable. 
Note: there were no AEs of B-cell malignancy in Study MDS-004.

Important Identified Risk: Tumour Flare Reaction (MCL and FL Indications)
The important identified risk of TFR is specific to lenalidomide-treated patients with lymphomas. 
The risk described below in Table 2.7.3.1-16 reflects data from the studies in MCL and FL only. 
There were no reports of TFR in the MM or MDS pivotal studies.
Table 2.7.3.1-16:
Important Identified Risk: Tumour Flare Reaction (MCL and FL 
Indications)
Important Identified Risk Tumour Flare Reaction (MCL and FL Indications)
Potential mechanisms 
Immune mediated responses have been postulated as an underlying mechanism that 
may  be  related  to  antitumour  activity.  In  a  case  review  of  four  patients  using 
lenalidomide139the aetiology of tumour flare is hypothesised to be mediated through 
upregulation  of  B-cell  activation markers  including CD40, CD80,  CD86,  HLA-DR 
and  CD95  expression  in  CLL  cells.    The  effect  of  10  or  20 mg  lenalidomide  on 
upregulation  of  CD80  molecules  was  studied  in  vitro140 in  CLL  with  attention  to 
TFR, also referred to as cytokine release syndrome. Strong CD80 upregulation and 
T-cell activation predicted more severe side effects, manifesting in 83% of patients as 
cytokine release syndrome within 8 to 72 hours after the first dose of lenalidomide, 
and  neither  the  severity  of  the  cytokine  release  syndrome  nor  the  degree  of  T-cell 
activation correlated with clinical response. Tumour flare reaction may correlate with 
response to treatment,141 although this has not been reproduced142 across all clinical 
trials describing the phenomenon.
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence
Based on clinical trial data, lenalidomide may increase the risk of TFR in patients 
with CLL and other lymphomas.

In Study MCL-002, Grade 3 or 4 TFR AEs were reported in 3 (1.8%) patients in the 
lenalidomide group and no patients in the control group. Tumour flare reaction AEs 
led  to  study  treatment  being  permanently  withdrawn,  dose  interruption  and  dose 
reduction  in  1  (0.6%)  lenalidomide-treated  patient  each.  No  patients  in  the  control 
group had TFR AEs.
Tumour flare reaction has been associated with greater tumour burden in CLL.142 In 
Study  MCL-002,  in  the  final  multivariate  model,  high  MIPI  score  at  diagnosis 
(p=0.084)  and  bulky  disease  at  baseline  (p=0.020)  appeared  to  be  strong  and 
independent risk factors for TFR.
When using steroids in the first days in CLL, there was a decrease in severity, but not 
in  TFR  incidence.138,141The  frequency  of  TFR  also  appears  to  be  lower  when 
lenalidomide  is  used  in  combination  with  rituximab 143 and  higher  sequential 
treatment with ofatumumab.144 A recommendation regarding careful monitoring and 
evaluation for TFR is included in the SmPC (SmPC, Section 4.4).
Clinical manifestations of TFR can include sudden onset of painful, tender swelling 
of disease-involved lymph nodes, spleen, and/or liver along with a low-grade fever. 
Also, rash and a rise in the peripheral blood white cell count can occur.145  
Generally,  interruption  or  modification  of  lenalidomide  dosing  is  not  required  in 
MCL,  and  use  of  non-steroidal,  analgesic  and  anti-inflammatory  drugs  has  been 
shown to be effective in cases when TFR does develop.146  
Tumour  flare  reaction  is  a  side  effect  of  cancer  treatment  that  may  mimic  disease 
progression.  Within  the  realm  of haematologic  malignancies,  TFR  is  specific  to 
lenalidomide  treatment  of  CLL  and  B-cell lymphomas.  Among  patients  with CLL, 
Chanan-Khan141 reported  58%  of  45 patients  experienced  TFR  and  Ferrajoli142
reported 30% of 44 patients were affected following lenalidomide starting doses of 
25 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. The frequency of TFR among MCL patients

Table 2.7.3.1-16:
Important Identified Risk: Tumour Flare Reaction (MCL and FL 
Indications)
Important Identified Risk Tumour Flare Reaction (MCL and FL Indications)
in a small Phase II study of lenalidomide was reported by Eve (2010) to be 12% (3/25 
patients).  Among  134  MCL  patients  treated  with  lenalidomide  at  25 mg,  13 (10%) 
experienced Grade 1 or 2 TFR.146 In this study, lenalidomide 25 mg (10 mg for CLcr 
30 to 60 mL/min) was self-administered orally on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day 
cycle until PD, intolerance, or voluntary withdrawal.
Tumour  flare  reaction  has  been  reported  in  Hodgkin’s  disease, 147 but  not  in 
association  with  MM  or  myelodysplasia.148 Most  TFRs  develop  very  early  in  the 
course of therapy and may mimic progression of disease (including increased absolute 
lymphocyte count); however, they subside over time and resolve within 2 weeks.
Tumour  flare  reaction  is  a  common  ADR  of  lenalidomide  treatment  (SmPC, 
Section 4.8). Tumour flare reaction is an important, transient and manageable adverse 
effect that may mimic disease progression and clinicians therefore need to be aware 
of  this  specific  complication.  Tumour  flare  reaction,  however,  can  be  quite 
confidently  distinguished  from  progressing  MCL  based  on  its  timing  and  clinical 
grounds (including signs of inflammatory reaction and the lack of nights sweats and 
weight loss), so that lenalidomide treatment is not discontinued unnecessarily.

No particular risk groups or risk factors have been identified for lenalidomide. In MM

level of cardiac failure AEs have been observed.
Cardiac symptoms in patients with MDS are often due to anaemia and may be due to 
iron overload and side effects of therapy.149 In a study of 840 MDS patients, Della 
Porta150 reported  that heart  failure  (28%  versus  18%,  p = 0.001) and  cardiac  death 
in 
(69% 
transfusion-dependent  patients.  In  a  Cox  analysis  with  time-dependent  covariates, 
transfusion-dependent  patients  showed  an  increased  risk  of  non-leukemic  death 
(HR = 2.12;  p  ≤ 0.001), heart  failure  (HR  = 1.34;  p = 0.03),  and  cardiac  death  (HR 
= 2.99; p = 0.01). The development of secondary iron overload significantly affected 
the risk of non-leukemic death and OS (HR = 1.25 and 1.16, respectively; p < 0.001), 
and this effect was maintained after adjusting for transfusion burden. Iron overload 
specifically  increased  the  risk  of  developing  heart  failure  (HR = 1.17,  p < 0.001). 
General risk factors for CHF include increasing age, previous heart disease, diabetes, 
and  previous  anthracycline  based  chemotherapy 
hypertension,  amyloidosis,
treatment.151
significantly  more 
frequent 
Preventability 
Careful monitoring of patients with known medical history that may be contributory 
to  a  cardiac  failure  event  should  be  carried  out.  Additionally,  if  serious  infection 
occurs in patients, they should be monitored carefully for cardiac failure events.
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Can have  mild  to  severe  to life-threatening  or  fatal  impact. Symptoms  can  be  mild 
with moderate activity or exertion to severe with minimal activity or at rest.
Public health impact.
Data concerning the incidence of cardiac failure in patients with MM and MDS are 
limited.  However,  high-output  cardiac  failure  is  one  of  the  known  cardiovascular 
issues  associated  with  MM  and  is  frequently  seen  in  patients  with  extensive  bone 
lesions.152 Cardiac  failure  is  a  common  cardiovascular  event  in  the  elderly.  Based 
upon the prospective Rotterdam Study of 7983 participants ≥ 55 years of age, the point 
prevalence of CHF on 01 Jan 1999 was 7.0%. Prevalence was higher in males aged 
55+ (8.0%) than in women similarly aged (6.0%). Prevalence increased rapidly with 
age, rising from 0.9% in patients aged 55 to 64, to 4.0% in patients aged 65 to 74, 
9.7% in those aged 75 to 84, to 17.4% in those aged 85 years or older. Lifetime risk 
for CHF was 33% for men and 29% for women at the age of 55.153 Based upon the 
most  recent  US  statistics  on CHF,154 the  overall  prevalence  of  CHF  is  2.1%,  with 
825,000  new  cases  annually.  Prevalence  is  greater  in  males  (2.5%)  than  females 
(1.8%), and rises dramatically with age. Among persons less than 60, the prevalence 
of CHF is less than 2.0%.
These prevalence proportions rise to 7.8% among males 60 to 79, and 8.6% among 
males aged 80+. Corresponding figures for females are 4.5% and 11.5%, respectively. 
The prevalence of cardiac failure or ejection fraction ≤ 50% as a comorbid disorder 
was determined to be 19% among 840 consecutively diagnosed MDS patients seen at 
the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, between 1992 and 2007, 
based  upon  detailed  review  of  patients’  medical  charts  and  laboratory  values  at 
diagnoses and during the course of disease.155

In Study MCL-002, Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia AEs were reported in the same 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  lenalidomide  and  control  groups  (both  2.4%).  The 
proportion  of  patients  with  cardiac  arrhythmia  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was 
lower in the lenalidomide group than the control group (0% versus 1.2%), whereas a 
greater proportion of patients in the lenalidomide group than the control group (2.4% 
versus 1.2%) experienced cardiac arrhythmia AEs leading to dose interruption.
Standard risk factors for atrial fibrillation include advancing age, European ancestry, 
body  size  (greater  height  and  body  mass  index),  electrocardiography  features  (left 
ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement), diabetes, systolic blood pressure and 
presence  of  cardiovascular  disease  (ie,  CHD,  heart  failure,  valvular  heart  disease). 
Other  factors  include  clinical  and  subclinical  hyperthyroidism,  chronic  kidney 
disease, and heavy alcohol consumption. Familial aggregation studies have identified 
a  role  for  genetic  factors,  although  such  factors  probably  account  for  a  small 
proportion of cases.154 In a case-control study of 385 eligible cases of new-onset atrial 
fibrillation  embedded  within  the  Rotterdam  study,  the  risk  of  new-onset  atrial 
fibrillation  was  significantly  higher  for  persons  who  received  a  corticosteroid 
prescription  within  1  month  before  the  atrial fibrillation  index  date. 157 Only 
high-dose  corticosteroid  use  was  associated  with  increased  risk  (OR  =  6.07;  95% 
CI: 3.90-9.42). The association of atrial fibrillation was independent of indication for 
use.  Risks  were  increased  not  only  in  patients  with  asthma  or  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease,  but  also  in  patients  with  rheumatic,  allergic,  or  malignant 
haematologic diseases.
Preventability 
Patients  with  a  known  cardiac  history  should  be  carefully  chosen  for  any 
chemotherapy and carefully monitored by their physician.
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Public health impact.
Can have mild to severe life-threatening or fatal impact. Symptoms can be mild or 
moderate with no or minimal non-invasive medical intervention indicated. Severe or 
life-threatening  symptoms  may  warrant  invasive  interventions  (eg,  pacemaker, 
ablation).
Data  concerning  the  incidence  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  in  patients  with  MM,  MDS, 
MCL and FL are limited. As reported from the Rotterdam study, a prospective cohort 
study among patients aged 55+, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation at baseline among 
6808 participants was 5.5%.158 Prevalence rose from 0.7% among those aged 55 to 
59,  to  17.8%  among  those  aged  85  and  above.  The  overall  incidence  rate  was 
9.9/1000 person-years. Prevalence  and  incidence  were  higher  in  men  than  women. 
Lifetime risks of atrial fibrillation at age 55 years were 23.8% in men and 22.2% in 
women.
The  prevalence  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  (defined  as  atrial  fibrillation  or  flutter,  sick 
sinus  syndrome,  or  ventricular  arrhythmias)  was  determined  to  be  7%  among  840 
consecutively diagnosed MDS patients seen at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San 
Matteo, Pavia, Italy, between 1992 and 2007, based upon detailed review of patients’ 
medical charts and laboratory values at diagnoses and during the course of disease.155
Patients who develop atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular 
complications, such as heart failure and ischaemic stroke.157 However, an association

8 lenalidomide plus rituximab-treated patients.
In Study NHL-007, the proportion of patients experiencing at least one IHD event was 
low  in  both  FL  patients  in the  lenalidomide  plus rituximab arm and rituximab  plus 
placebo arm (risk ratio = 0.5 [95% CI: 0.0-5.6]). 
In  Study  NHL-008,  IHD  events  were  reported  for  4.0%  of  lenalidomide  plus 
rituximab-treated patients.

Seven  out  of  353  (0.2%)  lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated  patients  experienced 
7 SAEs of MI. These SAEs were MI (5 patients), troponin I increased (one patient) 
and acute coronary syndrome (one patient). All of these SAEs were of Grade 3 or 4 
intensity. Only one of the SAEs was considered related to lenalidomide and included 
a fatal report secondary to CVA. An outcome of death was reported for 4 patients and 
causes included MI (2) and CVA (1) and respiratory failure (1). In 3 of the 7 reports 
of SAEs  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  was  withdrawn.  Of  these  patients  one 
recovered and 2 died. Dose was unchanged in 3 (1 SAE of acute coronary syndrome 
and 2 SAEs of acute MI); dose was interrupted in one patient who recovered (SAE of 
acute MI). A total of 3 SAEs (myocardial ischaemia and MI in one; MI in the other) 
were reported in 2 out of 350 (0.6%) placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients. In one 
patient who recovered the dose was interrupted and in the other patient the dose was 
unchanged and the patient recovered.

In Study MM-020, the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 IHD AEs was comparable in patients 
treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for 18 cycles or in patients treated with 
MPT for 12 cycles (1.5% and 1.8%, respectively), and was higher in patients treated 
with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  until  disease  progression  (4.7%).  Ischaemic 
heart  disease  AEs  led  to  withdrawal  of  study  treatment  permanently  or  dose 
interruption in ≤ 2.4% of patients in all treatment arms, with no IHD AEs resulting in 
dose reduction in any treatment arms.
In Study MM-015, Grade 3 or 4 IHD AEs were reported for a similar proportion of 
patients  in  Arms  MPR+R  and  MPR+p  (3.3%  and  2.6%,  respectively)  and  a  lower 
proportion of patients in Arm MPp+p (0.7%).
Ischaemic heart disease AEs led to the withdrawal of lenalidomide permanently in a 
single  patient  in  Arm  MPR+p,  and  dose  interruption  in  2.7%,  2.0%  and  2.0%  of 
patients  in  Arms  MPR+R,  MPR+p  and  MPp+p,  respectively.  No  patients  in  any
treatment arms had their dose reduced as a result of IHD AEs.

Risk  factors  for  10-year  coronary  risk  based  upon  the  Framingham  Heart  Study 
include  elevated  blood  pressure,  elevated  cholesterol,  high-density  lipoprotein-C, 
presence  of  diabetes  and  cigarette  smoking.154 These  factors  are  in  addition to  the 
well-known relationships between coronary risk and age and gender. 
In Europe, smoking remains a major public health issue and about 20% of death from 
CVD in men and about 3% of deaths from CVD in women are due to smoking. Levels 
of  obesity  are  high  across  Europe  in  both  adults  and  children,  although  rates  vary 
substantially between countries. Participation in physical activity is low. Increases in 
population body mass index over the interval 1980 to 2008 were noted in almost all

the last ten years, increasing by more than 50% in many countries.159
MI has  been reported in  patients receiving  lenalidomide, particularly  in  those  with 
known  risk  factors  and  within  the  first  12  months  when  used  in  combination  with 
dexamethasone.  Patients  with  known  risk  factors  – including  prior  thrombosis  –
should  be  closely  monitored,  and  action  should  be  taken  to  try  to  minimise  all 
modifiable  risk  factors  (eg,  smoking,  hypertension  and  hyperlipidaemia)  (SmPC, 
Section 4.4).
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Ischaemic heart disease can be life-threatening or fatal depending on the severity and 
impacts activities of daily living.
Public health impact.
Information  on  the  incidence/prevalence  of  MI  in  the  EU  is  limited.  Among 
5148 participants in the Rotterdam prospective cohort study of persons at least age 55 
with  no  evidence  of  prevalent  infarction,  141  recognised  MIs  occurred  and  the 
incidence  rate  of  this  event  was  5.0  per  1000  person-years.160 The  incidence  was 
higher  in  men  (8.4)  than  in  women  (3.1).  The  incidence  of  unrecognised  MI  was 
3.8 per 1000 person-years, with only small differences between men (4.2) and women 
(3.6). Rates generally increased with age for both recognised and unrecognised MI. 
In a population-based cohort of 3729 people older than 64 years identified in three 
geographical areas of Spain and free of previous MI, adjusted incidence rates of MI 
were  higher  in  men  (957  per  100,000  person-years)  than  in  women  (546  per 
100,000). 161 Thus,  men  showed  a  significantly  (p  <  0.001)  higher  cumulative 
incidence of MI at 10 years (7.2%) than women (3.8%). While cumulative incidence 
increased with age (p < 0.05), gender-differences tended to narrow. 
Using  linked  Hospital  Episode  Statistics  and  mortality  information,  the  Oxford 
Record Linkage studied English individuals of any age, who were admitted to hospital 
for AMI or who died suddenly  from AMI in 2010.162 They identified 82,252 AMI 
events.  Age-standardised  incidence  of  first  AMI  per  100,000  population  was 
130 (95% CI: 129–131) in men and 55.9 (95% CI: 55.3–56.6) in women. Incidence 
rates demonstrated a steep age gradient for both men and women, with about three-
quarters of all AMIs occurring in individuals aged ≥ 65 years. About one in six AMIs 
are reinfarctions in  both  men and  women,  and  this  proportion  increases  with  older 
age.
Disease of the heart and circulatory system (cardiovascular disease) is the main cause 
of death in the EU, accounting for 1.9 million deaths each year. Forty percent of all 
deaths  in  the  EU  (43%  of  deaths  in  women  and  36%  of  deaths  in  men)  are  from 
cardiovascular disease – slightly less than for Europe as a whole. Over a third of deaths 
from cardiovascular disease in the EU are from CHD. CHD by itself is the single most 
common cause of death in Europe and death rates from CHD are generally higher in 
Central and Eastern Europe than in Northern, Southern and Western Europe. CHD is 
also the single most common cause of death in the EU, accounting for over 681,000 
deaths in the EU each year: 15% of deaths among men, and 13% of deaths among 
women.159

An  increased  risk  of  mortality  in  patients  with  CLL,  a  current  non-approved  indication,  was 
observed  after  unblinded  review  of  data  from  Study  CC-5013-CLL-008.  The  Data  Monitoring 
Committee found an  imbalance of safety between the two study arms, specifically an  increased 
number of deaths in the lenalidomide arm, and OS in favour of chlorambucil. Upon request, the 
MAH’s Medical Information departments will provide available information and publications to 
physicians on the risk of the increase in mortality should a physician request information regarding 
use of lenalidomide in CLL.

Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Routine Pharmacovigilance activities in BMS as described in the BMS Pharmacovigilance System 
Master  File  and  Drug  Safety’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  are  in  accordance  with  “Good 
Pharmacovigilance Practices in the European Union.”
In addition to expedited reporting, BMS vigilantly undertakes follow-up on all ADRs, including 
serious  ADRs  that  are  provided  to  health  authorities  to  ensure  that  all  details  of  the  case  are 
captured for optimal clinical evaluation. This  includes efforts to obtain all relevant  information 
and to establish the final outcome of the ADRs.

Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-up Questionnaire
For  events  of  special  interest,  materials  and  tools  (such  as  event  specific  questions)  have  been 
developed to ensure that consistent and good quality follow-up information is obtained.
Event specific questionnaires are used to collect adverse reaction and follow-up information for 
all of the important identified and potential risks (see Part II SVIII). The forms are provided  in 
Annex 4 of the RMP.
3.1.1.2

3.1.1.3
Expedited Reporting and Follow-up of Pregnancy
The pregnancy capture and follow-up procedure is detailed below.
The  PPP  aims  to  minimise  the  risks  of  teratogenicity  by  ensuring  HCPs  and  patients  are  fully 
informed  of  and  understand  the  risks  of  teratogenicity  prior  to  starting  their  lenalidomide 
treatment.  Lenalidomide  is  structurally  related  to  thalidomide.  Thalidomide  is  a  known  human 
teratogenic  substance  that  causes  severe  life-threatening  birth  defects.  If  lenalidomide  is  taken 
during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect can  be  expected. The core PPP for lenalidomide reflects 
advice, guidance and direction obtained from the Member States.  
In order to ensure there is a consistent approach with the ability to capture all information globally, 
the same principles on obtaining follow-up data on pregnancies are implemented in all territories 
where lenalidomide is marketed whilst taking into account the legal and healthcare differences in 
those territories worldwide.
The objectives of the system are:
 To obtain information on all reported pregnancies of females exposed to lenalidomide.
 To obtain information on all reported pregnancies of female partners of male patients exposed 
to lenalidomide.
 To determine the root cause of all pregnancies and hence failures of the PPP.
230
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986380
Version 39.1
lenalidomide
In the EU BMS uses the following methods to enhance the capture of reports of pregnancy over 
and above reliance upon spontaneous reporting:
 The Educational Materials in the Educational HCP’s Kit make reference to the requirement to 
report all suspected pregnancies to the local BMS office and where applicable to the NCA. The 
Patient Brochure also advises the patient to immediately seek medical advice if there is any 
risk or suspicion of possible risk of pregnancy. Similar advice is also provided with reference 
to female partners of male patients.
Database of Pregnancy Reports
All reports of pregnancies received by BMS are entered into BMS’s Global Safety Database. This 
includes all Consumer reports in addition to HCP reports. Any abnormal pregnancy test result (eg, 
β-hCG)  elevated  and  positive  urine  pregnancy  test  are  immediately  processed.  EU  Health 
Authorities are notified of these reports.
Follow-up
All  reports  of  pregnancies  are  followed  up.  Follow-up  is  via  the  physician/obstetrician/ 
neonatologist/paediatrician  as  appropriate.  In  each  country  office,  any  report  of  pregnancy  is 
followed up by the Drug Safety staff. All reports of pregnancy are also immediately notified to the 
EEA Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) and QPPV deputies.
All reports of abnormal pregnancy test results are followed up with the prescriber and follow-up 
information sent to Health Authorities.
Frequency/Duration of Follow-up
Upon receipt of a notification of pregnancy, the pregnancy specific follow-up questionnaire is sent 
to the reporter. Upon receipt of this information by BMS, dates for further follow-up actions are 
tracked. 
The HCP/Obstetrician is also sent a Follow-up and Outcome Form to be completed at the outcome 
of the Pregnancy. 
An  Infant  follow-up  form  is  available  for  use  in  the  event  that  a  birth  defect  is  detected  as  an 
outcome. 
Corresponding standard forms are available on request.
Root Cause of Failure of Pregnancy Prevention Programme
The Pregnancy Background Form includes questions to determine why the PPP was unsuccessful 
for the case in question. 
Regulatory Reporting of Pregnancies
All initial pregnancy reports and follow-up information are reported on an expedited basis within 
15 days. 
Should any suspected teratogenic effect be reported following treatment with lenalidomide, this is 
expedited immediately.

Compliance with the PPP is  monitored in each  member state. Examples of  methods to monitor 
compliance  include keeping a record of counselling patients prior to prescription, a record of a 
negative pregnancy test within 3 days of prescription and a record of dispensing within 7 days of 
the prescription date, etc. The maximum interval of consecutive PPP compliance studies is agreed 
on between BMS and individual NCAs.
3.1.1.4
An Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions of Special Interest within the 
Required PSURs
Emerging  potential  safety  signals  can  be  detected  by  periodic  and  if  appropriate,  cumulative 
evaluation of the ADRs. The results are compiled in the PSUR, with summaries and conclusions 
submitted to the health authorities.
In  addition,  data  regarding  pregnancy  exposure  to  lenalidomide  is  targeted  for  review  and  is 
specifically  discussed in  the  PSUR  document.  These  data  include  all  pregnancy  case  reports 
collected during the specified period together with cumulative data. Non-medically confirmed case 
reports  of  suspected  foetal  exposure  are  also  provided,  whenever  applicable.  Occupational
exposure in pregnant females (eg, a nurse opening the capsules, laboratory technician or carer) is 
also provided with the corresponding outcome in each PSUR.
PSURs  are  submitted  in  accordance  with  GVP  in  the  EU.  Periodicity  of  PSUR  submissions  is 
defined by the EURD-List.

Pregnancy Prevention Programme Implementation
The pregnancy capture and follow-up procedure is detailed above. 
Physicians are encouraged or required as per local legislation to report pregnancies to BMS or in 
accordance to local legislation to the NCA.
Additional monitoring of the implementation of the BMS PPP is carried out on a country basis in 
agreement with relevant NCA (Table 3.2.1-1).
The postmarketing surveillance study RRMM PASS (Annex 2) was also performed  in Member 
States where this was feasible. This study monitored compliance to the process indicators of the 
implemented PPP and reporting of exposure during pregnancy was also stimulated through this 
study.

patients  with  NDMM  (both  transplant  eligible  and  non-eligible)  (Table  3.2.2-1).  The  primary 
objectives  of  the  registry  are  to  describe  practice  patterns  of  common  first-line  and  subsequent 
treatment  regimens  (including  lenalidomide  based)  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  MM, 
whether or not eligible for transplant, as well as diagnostic patterns and occurrence of SPM in a 
‘real world’ population. All consecutive patients at more than 250 participating sites in community 
and academic settings in the US who have NDMM within 2 months of enrollment were eligible, 
with planned follow-up on a quarterly basis up to early discontinuation or study end, expected in 
2024. This registry enrolled 3011 newly diagnosed MM patients in two cohorts. The first cohort 
(Cohort  1)  consists  of  1493 patients  enrolled  between  Sep  2009  and  Dec 2011.  The  extension 
cohort (Cohort 2) consists of 1518 patients enrolled between Dec 2012 and Apr 2016.

containing regimen and those treated with a first-line non lenalidomide-containing regimen; and 
to identify, quantify, and characterise risk factors for cardiovascular events in this population of 
TNE NDMM patients (Table 3.2.2-2). The incidence of other treatment-emergent events will be 
examined  to  characterise  the  overall  safety  profile  of  lenalidomide  among  patients  within  the 
labelled indication. SPM follow-up will extend beyond active treatment. 
The  Revlimid  TNE  NDMM  PASS (CC-5013-MM-034) is  designed  as  a  prospective  non-
interventional  study  to  compare  the  incidence  of  cardiovascular  events  between  TNE  NDMM 
patients treated with a first-line lenalidomide-containing regimen and those treated with a first-line 
non-lenalidomide-containing regimen. The study will gather extensive risk factor information at 
baseline and throughout follow-up to aid in the interpretation of any observed differences in the 
incidence of cardiovascular events between the two cohorts. Other safety endpoints of interest will 
be characterised through standard follow-up procedures.
This study will be implemented in a selected number of countries in the EU. Sites will be selected 
based  on their  expertise  in  treating  patients  with  NDMM,  access  to  lenalidomide  through  local 
reimbursement options, sufficient resources to conduct observational research, and on their ability 
to collect and report data for this study at the required quality standards. In particular, sites will be

asked to confirm during the feasibility assessment that they are able to commit to liaise with other 
treating physicians (eg, cardiologists) to ensure sufficient follow-up with patients regarding any 
cardiovascular  events;  this  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  tests,  diagnoses,  treatment,  and 
outcome information. Site selection will attempt to cover multiple EU countries, urban and rural 
locations, as well as different types of medical centres (eg, public, private or university ownership).
It is anticipated that approximately 888 patients would be enrolled. The final study report could be 
available in 2027. Safety updates will be submitted with future PSURs.

MDS PASSes
The EC Decision for variation EMEA/H/C/717/II/056 (13-Jun-2013) in relation to the extension 
of indication for use of Revlimid in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or 
INT-1 risk MDS associated with an isolated del 5q cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic 
options  are  insufficient  or  inadequate,  was  granted  with  a  Condition  to  the  Marketing 
Authorisation.  As  described  in  Annex  IID  to  the  EC  Decision,  the  MAH  will  conduct  a 
non-interventional PASS of patients with MDS treated with lenalidomide to gather safety data on 
the use of lenalidomide in MDS patients and monitor off-label use. A synopsis for this study was 
adopted at the time of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Opinion for 
this  variation  (25-Apr-2013),  and  a  full  protocol  was  submitted  for  review  by  the  PRAC  on

BMS is sponsoring Connect® MDS/AML Disease Registry, a US prospective, longitudinal, multi-
centre observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed MDS, idiopathic cytopenia of 
undetermined significance (ICUS; > 18-years-old) or AML (≥ 55-years-old) to address important 
research  questions  in  these  specific  diseases.  The  Connect® MDS/AML  Disease  Registry  will 
collect data regarding diagnostic and treatment patterns and patient outcomes (Table 3.2.2-4). The 
objectives  of  the  registry  are:  to  describe  patterns  for  diagnosis,  prognosis,  treatment,  clinical 
monitoring  and  outcome  measures  in  patients  with  MDS,  ICUS  and  AML;  to  compare  routine 
clinical  practice  patterns  with  existing  management  guidelines  (eg,  National  Comprehensive 
Cancer Network); to describe treatment patterns and outcomes in del(5q) patients with or without 
additional  cytogenetic  abnormalities,  and  in  non-del(5q)  patients;  and  to  summarise  patient-
reported outcomes (eg, health related quality of life [HRQoL]) and economic outcomes, and their 
association  with  patient  characteristics,  treatment  regimens,  and  clinical  outcomes.  Exploratory 
objectives are to evaluate molecular and/or cellular markers in the blood/bone marrow tissues and 
oral epithelial cells that may provide further prognostic classification of MDS and AML subtypes 
and/or may provide information on drug mechanism of action and on-therapy markers predictive 
of  clinical  outcomes  and  potentially  impact  clinical  outcomes  with  therapy;  to  summarise  the 
clinical  status  (eg,  OS,  PFS,  response  rate)  of  patients  with  or  without  mutations  by  treatment 
regimen, and to analyse the correlation between mutation detection/allele burden in bone marrow 
and peripheral blood samples. Data regarding SPM will also be collected. The planned follow-up 
in  this  longitudinal  study  will  be  for  a  maximum  of  8 years.  It  is  expected  that  patients  will 
complete a set of concise HRQoL questionnaires on an approximate quarterly basis (AML patients 
will complete an additional set at 2 months following enrollment). Participating sites are required 
to report relevant data on a quarterly basis. The Connect® MDS/AML Disease Registry enrolled 
its first patient in Dec 2013. Data from Connect® MDS/AML Disease Registry will be included as 
part of future PSURs once available.

RRMCL PASS 
This RRMCL PASS (CC-5013-MCL-005) (Table 3.2.2-5) was designed to gather additional safety 
information  as  a  multinational,  non-interventional  study  following  the  request  for  further 
assessment of safety issues via postmarketing surveillance.
Potential  sites will  be  identified where R/R MCL patients have been treated with  lenalidomide. 
Site inclusion will  be  limited to countries where  lenalidomide  is reimbursed  for this  indication. 
Identification of sites will be done through partnerships such as, but not limited to that with the 
European Mantle Cell Lymphoma Registry. Other sources including knowledge of, or experience 
with sites can also be used for site identification purposes. Identified sites will then be assessed for 
feasibility and invited to participate in the study. All data will be collected retrospectively from 
identified patients following the first dose of lenalidomide treatment for up to 6 months, including 
those patients who died within this data collection period.

3.2.3
Second Primary Malignancies Monitoring in Ongoing Studies
Invasive SPM will be considered important medical events. BMS will perform long-term follow-
up in ongoing clinical studies to monitor SPM for BMS-sponsored studies. For Study MCL-002: 
the  follow-up  phase  is  to  continue  until  70%  of  patients  in  the  study  have  died,  or the  median 
follow-up  for  responding  patients  is  > 2  years,  or  the  median  duration  of  response  has  been 
reached, or 4 years  from the date the  last patient was randomised  is reached, whichever comes 
latest. 
For Study MM-020, SPM was to be documented for 5 years following randomisation of the last 
patient. For Study MM-015, patients were contacted in the follow-up phase (for at least 5 years) 
to determine if the patient had been diagnosed with SPM.

PART V:  RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING EVALUATION 
OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES)
The following sets out the basis of the Risk Minimisation Programme, where applicable for the 
safety concerns discussed in this document. 
The same core requirements of the Risk Minimisation Programme apply across all indications for 
lenalidomide  in  the  EU,  since  the  Risk  Minimisation  Programme  is  product  and  not  indication 
specific. Furthermore, the core requirements of the Risk Minimisation Programme apply across all 
Member  States,  however,  the  local  implementation  differs  between  Member  States  taking  into 
account  the  local  differences  in  healthcare  system,  legal  framework  and  culture.  Therefore, 
consultations have taken place with NCAs to determine the appropriate method of implementation 
of the Risk Minimisation Programme in each Member State.
Consultations  also  took  place  with  haematology  physicians,  pharmacists  and  oncology  nurses 
throughout  Europe  in  order  to  determine  the  method  of  delivery  of  the  Risk  Minimisation 
Programme  appropriate  to  each  Member  State.  Thus,  the  local  implementation  of  the  Risk 
Minimisation Programme has taken into account the differing healthcare systems throughout the 
EU Member States. 
For  lenalidomide,  the  PPP  is  a  key  element of  the  Risk  Minimisation  Programme.  However,  it 
must also be noted that other activities aimed at minimising the risk of other adverse reactions, 
such  as  serious  infection  due  to  neutropenia  and  bleeding  due  to  thrombocytopenia  are  also 
included in the Risk Minimisation Programme.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for REVLMID (lenalidomide)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  REVLIMID. The  RMP  details 
important risks of REVLIMID, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about REVLIMID 's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
REVLIMID's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and  its package  leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how REVLIMID should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for REVLIMID should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of REVLIMID's 
RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
REVLIMID is authorised in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously  treated  follicular  lymphoma  (FL);  as  monotherapy  for the  maintenance  treatment of 
adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have undergone autologous 
stem cell transplantation (ASCT); in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of MM in 
adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with dexamethasone, 
or bortezomib and dexamethasone, or melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients 
with  previously  untreated  MM  who  are    not  eligible  for  transplant;  as  monotherapy  for  the 
treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate 1 (INT-
1)  risk  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  associated  with  an  isolated  deletion  5q  (del  5q) 
cytogenetic  abnormality  when  other  therapeutic  options  are  insufficient  or  inadequate;  and  as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma 
(RRMCL)  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  REVLIMID  contains  lenalidomide  as  the  active 
substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of REVLIMID’s benefits can be found in REVLIMID’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines  Agency 
(EMA)

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of REVLIMID, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about REVLIMID's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
257
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986380
Version 39.1
lenalidomide 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In  the  case of  REVLIMID, these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of REVLIMID is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  REVLIMID are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of REVLIMID. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Haematologic  malignancies  by  themselves  or  by  virtue  of  their  therapeutic 
strategies, chemotherapy, radiation or haematopoietic stem cell transplant put 
patients at risk of infections. The introduction of stem cell transplantation and 
novel anti-myeloma agents has improved the outcome  of patients with MM. 
These advances have transformed MM into a chronic condition, with multiple

stem  cell transplantation has  broadened the  spectrum  of  infection  to  include 
those  caused  by  Clostridium  difficile,  cytomegalovirus,  and  opportunistic 
moulds.  Risk  factors  include  myeloma-related  innate  immunodeficiency, 
which  involves  various arms  of  the  immune  system  and  includes  B-cell 
dysfunction 
Polyclonal 
hypogammaglobulinemia  has  been  classically  associated  with  infection  by 
encapsulated  bacteria,  such  as  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Haemophilus 
influenzae.  Myeloma  and  treatment-associated  organ  dysfunctions  and 
comorbidities  also  increase  the  risk  of  infection.  These  dysfunctions  and 
comorbidities  include  (1)  renal  failure  (cast  nephropathy,  hypercalcemia, 
deposition disease, and others), respiratory compromise, caused by collapse of 
thoracic vertebra and opiate therapy (which may depress the central nervous 
system) given to patients with painful fractures (3) severe alimentary mucosal 
damage  (caused  by  chemotherapy,  radiation  therapy,  or  graft-versus-host 
disease) (4) hyperglycemia induced by dexamethasone (5) transfusional iron 
overload  and  (6)  the  multisystem  involvement  by  myeloma-associated 
deposition diseases (AL-amyloidosis and light chain deposit disease). Indeed, 
levels  of  CD4+  T  cells,  particularly  naive  and  activated  subsets,  decrease 
significantly  with  increasing  cycles  of  chemotherapy,  a  decrease  strongly 
associated with opportunistic infections. Finally, myeloma typically affects an 
older population, with a median age of 62 to 73 years. These patients frequently 
experience an age-related decline in physiologic reserve of various organs and 
from  other  age-related  conditions,  including  frailty,  geriatric  syndromes, 
cognitive dysfunction, and social isolation, all of which may increase the risk 
of infection.
Lenalidomide treatment in combination with dexamethasone in MM patients 
with at least one prior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 
neutropenia  compared  to  placebo-dexamethasone  treated  patients  (SmPC, 
Section 4.4). The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone 
in  clinical trials  of  NDMM  patients is associated  with a higher  incidence  of 
Grade 4 neutropenia than MPp+p treated patients (SmPC, Section 4.4).

lenalidomide 
The proportion of patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression in 
one study of lenalidomide-treated patients with MM was significantly higher 
for  patients  who  had  prior  high-dose  chemotherapy  and  stem  cell 
transplantation,  compared  with  those  that  did  not.  Impairment  of  antibody 
response, neutropenia, treatment with glucocorticoids, and reduction of normal 
Ig all increase the likelihood of infection. While a much greater proportion of 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone  patients  experienced  neutropenia  relative  to 
placebo/dexamethasone  patients,  this increased risk  did not  translate  into  an 
infection risk of the same magnitude in either the total study population or in 
the study population restricted to Grade 3 or 4 toxicities.
Lenalidomide treatment in MDS patients is associated with a higher incidence 
of Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  compared  with  patients  on  placebo  (SmPC, 
Section 4.4).  In  patients  with  MDS,  those  experiencing  neutropenia  while 
receiving lenalidomide may be at increased risk for infections.

In clinical trials, AML and B-cell malignancies have been reported in patients 
treated with lenalidomide. 
Based  on  clinical  trial  data,  lenalidomide  may  increase  the  risk  of  NMSC. 
Patients with MM also have an increased risk of NMSC.
Patients treated with lenalidomide may be at increased risk of developing new 
cancers.  The reason  for  this  is not  clear,  but  further investigations  are  being 
undertaken.
MDS Populations (Haematologic Malignancies)
A study to identify prognostic factors for progression to leukaemia (LFS) and 
OS  was  reported  by  Malcovati.  Four  hundred  seventy-six patients  first 
diagnosed with de novo MDS between 1992 and 2002 were evaluated. In one 
of the earliest studies to report the negative effects of developing a transfusion 
requirement, Malcovati reported an increased risk associated with transfusion 
burden when analysed as a time-dependent covariate in a combined group of 
patients with RA, RARS or MDS with del(5q) (HR = 3.46).

risk  of  AML  progression  and  death 
Further  development  of  the  WPSS  a  learning  cohort  of  426  Italian  MDS 
patients and a validation cohort of 193 German MDS patients was reported by 
Malcovati  and  colleagues. In  a  multivariable  analysis  of  the  Italian  patients 
stratified  by  WHO  subgroups,  cytogenetics  (HR  =  1.48)  and  transfusion 
requirement (HR = 2.53) significantly affected OS and risk of AML (HR = 1.3 
and  HR  =  2.4,  respectively).  These  findings  were  corroborated  in  the 
subsequent multivariable analysis of German MDS patients stratified by WHO
subgroups, with cytogenetics (HR = 1.84) and transfusion dependency (HR = 
1.85)  and  risk  of  AML  (HR  =  2.27  and  HR = 2.25,  respectively).  Mallo 
reported the results of a cooperative study designed to assess prognostic factors 
for OS and progression to AML in 541 patients with de novo MDS and del 5q. 
In multivariate analyses the most important predictors of both OS and AML 
progression  were number  of  chromosomal abnormalities  (p < 0.001  for  both 
outcomes),  platelet  count  (p  <  0.001  and  p  =  0.001,  respectively)  and 
proportion  of  bone  marrow  blasts  (p < 0.001  and  p  =  0.016,  respectively). 
Transfusion burden was not addressed in this study.
Knuendgen  assessed 
in 
the 
295 lenalidomide-treated  MDS-003 and  MDS-004 patients versus  125 MDS 
patients with del 5q from a large multicentre registry  who had received  best 
supportive care only including ESAs. In the final multivariate Cox proportional 
hazard models, lenalidomide treatment was not associated with progression to 
AML (HR 0.939; p = 0.860). Significant factors associated with an increased 
risk of AML progression were complex cytogenetics (del 5q plus > 1 abn; HR 
3.627; p = 0.002), bone marrow blasts 5% to 10% (HR 2.215; p = 0.016), and 
higher transfusion burden (HR 1.097 [10% increase in risk per unit at baseline]; 
p = 0.029).  Higher  haemoglobin  levels  were  associated  with  a  reduced  risk 
(HR  0.857;  p =  0.054).  Regarding  survival,  lenalidomide  treatment  was 
associated with a reduced risk of death (HR 0.597; p = 0.012). 
Other  factors  associated  with  decreased  mortality  were  higher  haemoglobin 
levels (HR 0.883; p = 0.028), higher platelet counts (HR 0.999; p = 0.035), and 
female  sex  (HR  0.598;  p  =  0.002).  Higher  transfusion  burden  (HR  1.056; 
p = 0.037) and age (HR 1.049; p < 0.001) increased the risk of death.
Mutations  in  the  TP53  gene  have  been  well  described  as  a  poor  prognostic 
variable  and  associated  with  chemotherapy  resistance  in  a  wide  variety  of 
malignancies including high-risk MDS and AML.

NMSC
Risk factors for NMSC include: increased sun or ultraviolet radiation exposure; 
physical  factors  such  as  fair  skin,  red  or  blond  hair,  and  light  eye  colour; 
chemical carcinogens such as, arsenic, tobacco, and oral methoxsalen; ionising 
radiation; and previous history of NMSC.
Prolonged survival as a result of improved therapies

As  previously  noted,  the  5-year  relative  survival  among  MM  patients  has 
increased from 24.6% among patients first diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 44.9% 
among patients first diagnosed between 2003 and 2009.
Due to improvements in the care of patients with cancer, the number of cancer 
survivors has been increasing in recent years. Increased longevity increases the 
risk of developing second malignancy, including NMSC.

Based  on  clinical  trial  data,  a  higher  incidence  of  cardiac  failure  has  been 
observed; the reason for this is not clear.
Based  on  clinical  trial  data,  a  higher  incidence  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  was 
observed in the lenalidomide arm.
No particular risk groups or risk factors have been identified for lenalidomide. 
In MM and MDS no differences in frequency, severity, serious outcomes and 
apparent risk level of cardiac failure AEs have been observed.
Cardiac symptoms in patients with MDS are often due to anaemia and may be 
due  to  iron  overload  and  side  effects  of  therapy.  In  a  study  of  840  MDS 
patients, Della Porta reported that heart failure (28% versus 18%, p = 0.001) 
and cardiac death (69% versus 55%, p = 0.03) were significantly more frequent 
in  transfusion-dependent  patients.  In  a  Cox  analysis  with  time-dependent 
covariates,  transfusion-dependent  patients  showed  an  increased  risk  of  non-
leukemic death (HR = 2.12; p ≤ 0.001), heart failure (HR = 1.34; p = 0.03), and 
cardiac  death  (HR  = 2.99;  p = 0.01).  The  development  of  secondary  iron 
overload  significantly  affected  the  risk  of  non-leukemic  death  and  OS  (HR 
= 1.25 and 1.16, respectively; p < 0.001), and this effect was maintained after 
adjusting for transfusion burden. Iron overload specifically increased the risk 
of  developing  heart  failure  (HR  = 1.17,  p < 0.001).  General  risk  factors  for 
CHF  include  increasing  age,  previous  heart  disease,  diabetes,  hypertension, 
amyloidosis, and previous anthracycline based chemotherapy treatment.
Standard  risk  factors  for  atrial  fibrillation  include  advancing  age,  European 
ancestry, body size (greater height and body mass index), electrocardiography 
features  (left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  left  atrial  enlargement),  diabetes,
systolic blood pressure and presence of cardiovascular disease (ie, CHD, heart 
failure, valvular heart disease). Other factors include clinical and subclinical 
hyperthyroidism,  chronic  kidney  disease,  and  heavy  alcohol  consumption. 
Familial aggregation studies have identified a role for genetic factors, although 
such factors probably account for a small proportion of cases. In a case-control 
study of 385 eligible cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation embedded within the 
Rotterdam  study,  the  risk  of  new-onset  atrial  fibrillation  was  significantly 
higher for persons who received a corticosteroid prescription within 1 month 
before the atrial fibrillation index date. Only high-dose corticosteroid use was 
associated  with 
increased  risk  (OR = 6.07;  95%  CI: 3.90-9.42).  The 
association  of  atrial  fibrillation  was independent  of  indication  for  use.  Risks 
were  increased  not  only  in  patients  with  asthma  or  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary disease, but also in patients with rheumatic, allergic, or malignant 
haematologic diseases.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
In clinical trials, ischaemic heart disease has been reported in patients treated 
with lenalidomide. Myocardial infarction occurs relatively often in individuals 
of the older age groups that most often develop the target indications of MM, 
MDS, MCL and FL.
Risk factors for 10-year coronary risk based upon the Framingham Heart 
Study include elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein-C, presence of diabetes and cigarette smoking. These factors are 
in addition to the well-known relationships between coronary risk and age 
and gender. 
In  Europe,  smoking  remains  a  major  public  health  issue  and  about  20%  of 
death from CVD in men and about 3% of deaths from CVD in women are due 
to  smoking.  Levels  of  obesity  are  high  across  Europe  in  both adults  and 
children, although rates vary substantially between countries. Participation in 
physical  activity  is  low.  Increases  in  population  body  mass  index  over  the 
interval 1980  to  2008  were noted  in  almost all  countries.  The  prevalence  of 
diabetes  in Europe  is high and has  increased rapidly  over  the last  ten  years, 
increasing by more than 50% in many countries.

Purpose of the study: Monitoring implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme.
Revlimid TNE NDMM Registry (CC-5013-MM-034)
Purpose of the study: The primary objectives are to compare the incidence of cardiovascular events 
between TNE NDMM patients treated with a first-line lenalidomide-containing regimen and those 
treated  with  a  first-line  non  lenalidomide-containing  regimen;  and  to  identify,  quantify,  and

Connect® MM: The Multiple Myeloma Disease Registry 
Purpose of the study: The primary objectives of the registry are to describe practice patterns of 
common first-line and subsequent treatment regimens (including lenalidomide-based) in patients 
with previously untreated MM, whether or not eligible for transplant, as well as diagnostic patterns 
and occurrence of SPM in a ‘real world’ population.
Connect® MDS/AML Disease Registry 
Purpose of the study: The primary objectives of the registry are to describe patterns for diagnosis, 
prognosis, treatment, clinical monitoring and outcome measures in patients with MDS, ICUS and 
AML;  to  compare  routine  clinical  practice  patterns  with  existing  management  guidelines  (eg, 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network); to describe treatment patterns and outcomes in del(5q) 
patients with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities; and in non-del(5q) patients; and to 
summarise patient-reported outcomes (eg, health related Quality of Life [HRQoL]) and economic 
outcomes,  and  their  association  with  patient  characteristics,  treatment  regimens,  and  clinical 
outcomes.  Exploratory  objectives  are  to  evaluate  molecular  and/or  cellular  markers  in  the 
blood/bone  marrow  tissues  and  oral  epithelial  cells  that  may  provide  further  prognostic 
classification of MDS and AML subtypes and/or may provide information on drug mechanism of 
action  and  on-therapy  markers  predictive  of  clinical  outcomes  and  potentially  impact  clinical 
outcomes with therapy; to summarise the clinical  status (eg, overall survival [OS], progression-
free survival [PFS], response rate) of patients with or without mutations by treatment regimen, and 
to analyse the correlation between mutation detection/allele burden in bone marrow and peripheral 
blood samples. Data regarding SPM are also being collected.
RRMCL PASS (CC-5013-MCL-005)
Purpose of the study: To quantify and characterise the event of tumour flare reaction (TFR) by 
tumour  burden  and  the  proportion  of  early  deaths  by  tumour  burden  in  patients  treated  with 
lenalidomide in a ‘real world’ setting.

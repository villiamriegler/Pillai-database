1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 13 March 2019 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of Indication to include new population for Toujeo (i.e. adolescents and children from the age of 6 
years). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet 
is updated in accordance.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Not applicable.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with the authorised 
orphan medicinal product.  
Scientific advice 
On November 02, 2018 the applicant informed the EMA about the proposed submission plan. The applicant 
sought EMA’s agreement that the initial Type II variation of Toujeo be submitted with the 6-months 
on-treatment data (primary endpoint assessment at week 26). In addition, the applicant requested EMA’s 
agreement with the plan to rely on children/adolescent T1DM data and leverage adult T2DM data to expand 
the indication to the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adolescents and children aged 6 years and above. 
Written Pre-submission Advice was received from EMA on December 21, 2018, indicating that EMA 
considered the applicant’s proposal to extrapolate data from adult (insulin-naïve) patients with T2DM to the 
paediatric population with T1DM and advised that these data should be incorporated into a comprehensive 
extrapolation plan in line with the EMA guideline.  
EMA indicated that submission of the Type II variation with 52 weeks of data (including the 26 week 
extension arm) would be the preferred approach, however it is the applicant’s position that 26 weeks of data 
are sufficient to evaluate the efficacy and the safety profile in the paediatric population as Toujeo was well 
tolerated and had a general safety profile similar to the well-established safety profile of Lantus during the

26-weeks treatment period of study EFC13957. No safety concerns had been identified from the preliminary 
results of the 6-months safety extension which will be submitted during the review period.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) occurs at any age but the majority of patients diagnosed are children and 
adolescents, with peaks in disease presentation at 5 to 7 years of age and around puberty. 
Globally, the incidence of T1DM continues to rise by 2 to 5% each year. The prevalence of T1DM varies 
considerably from country to country. In the US, the estimated prevalence of T1DM is 1 in 300 by 18 years 
of age.

Patients with T1DM require insulin replacement therapy, which is designed to approximate physiologic basal 
and postprandial insulin release, thereby avoiding hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. To achieve this, 
basal-bolus insulin regimens that approximate continuous 24-hour blood-glucose control are typically used: 
a basal insulin analogue is given to provide stable blood glucose lowering over the 24-hour day, including 
during the overnight fast, and a rapid-acting insulin analogue is given before each meal to provide 
postprandial control. 
Currently approved basal insulin aimed at providing 24-hour glucose control is Lantus. Insulin glargine 
(insulin glargine 100 U/mL, Lantus) is a recombinant analogue of human insulin. Lantus is approved in EU in 
the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children 2 years and above. Lantus provides a 
24-hour basal insulin supply after single-dose subcutaneous (SC) injection. Lantus has been registered in 
the US and Europe since 2000 and is considered to be a standard-of-care basal insulin. 
Toujeo is another insulin glargine 300 U/mL long-acting human insulin analogue, produced by recombinant 
DNA technology in E. coli (K12), but is only approved for use in adults. It has the same composition as insulin 
glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus) but is a more concentrated formulation that contains 3 times the amount of 
active pharmaceutical ingredient (insulin glargine). Toujeo has a glucose-lowering activity of >24 hours 
after single-dose SC injection. Toujeo is approved for the treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus in the EU 
by centralized procedure on 24 April 2015, as a line extension to Toujeo 100 U/mL (previously called 
Optisulin) approved in the EU since June 2000.  
The current variation concerns an extension of the indication of Toujeo with the paediatric population with 
diabetes mellitus from the age of 6 years: 
Proposed indication 
“Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 6 years.”. 
Proposed posology 
Toujeo is a basal insulin for once daily administration at any time of the day, preferably at the same time 
every day. 
Paediatric population: 
Toujeo can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 6 years (see section 5.1). When switching 
basal insulin to Toujeo, dose reduction of basal and bolus insulin needs to be considered on an individual 
basis, in order to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Contents of the dossier 
Paediatric indication for T1DM: 
The applicant submitted an application for an indication extension application to support the safety and 
efficacy of Toujeo in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older with diabetes mellitus. It focuses primarily on 
the results from a phase 3b clinical study EFC13957 (EDITION JUNIOR) conducted in paediatric patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with insulin glargine 300 U/mL  
Paediatric indication for T2DM: 
The application also included selected efficacy and safety data from 3 of the 4 Phase 3 studies in adult 
patients included in the initial submission dossier of Toujeo (EFC12456 in T1DM, and EFC12347 and 
EFC11628 in type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) to support by extrapolation the extension of the indication to 
include children and adolescents with T2DM.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Being natural proteins, analogues such as insulin glargine, are not excreted unchanged and do not give rise 
to metabolites with potential biological activity. In view of this, guidance on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) especially exempt amino 
acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a complete environmental assessment and therefore, no 
assessment of the ERA for Toujeo is needed. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trial is performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Toujeo PK in paediatric Study EFC13957 
In paediatric study EFC13957 (see section 2.4.2.1 for description of the study), blood samples were taken 
after the end of the titration phase during the period from Week 20 to Week 26. The mean daily basal insulin 
dose at Week 26 was slightly higher in the HOE901-U300 group (0.615 [0.232] U/kg) compared to the 
Lantus group (0.567 [0.237] U/kg).  
From patients who administered their dose in the evening on the day before the date of the visit, 12 h, 16 h 
and 20 h post-dose samples were taken. From patients who administered their dose in the morning on the 
day of the visit, pre-dose, 4 h and 8 h post-dose samples were taken. Descriptive statistics are provided 
based on the nominal times with time windows of within 1h before dosing for the pre-dose samples and +1 
h for the post-dose samples. Following administration of insulin glargine either as Toujeo (300 U/mL) or as 
Lantus (100 U/mL), the major molecular entity in the circulation is the insulin glargine metabolite M1. 
Therefore, descriptive statistics was focused on the concentrations of insulin glargine M1. The arithmetic 
mean and median concentrations of insulin glargine M1 were slightly lower in the Toujeo treatment arm than 
in the Lantus treatment arm at all time points of the evening and of the morning groups, respectively (Table 
1 and Table 2).

Study EFC13957 
Table 2. Summary statistics of plasma concentrations of insulin glargine M1 following Lantus treatment in 
Study EFC13957 
PK results obtained in children 6-<18 years of age in Study EFC13957 indicate a somewhat lower exposure 
to insulin glargine M1 metabolite following administration of Toujeo versus Lantus. These results are in line 
with the results from the bioequivalence study PKD10086 in adults, which showed a lower AUC0-24, and a 
lower Cmax of about one-third for the Toujeo versus Lantus formulation, administered at the same dose of 
0.4 U/kg body weight. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis (Analysis POH0663) 
To support this application, a population-PK analysis aimed to describe the PK of HOE901-U300 in children 
and adolescents and to compare it with the PK of HOE901-U300 in adults. The first step of the model building 
was to develop a population-PK model using data from adults (Lantus study 1008) and study TDR11626 in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/596054/2019

patient PD and PK/PD study reports. In a second step, the adult model was used as prior knowledge for the 
analysis using data from children and adolescents (study EFC13957). In total 3 different procedures were 
investigated: (i) a Bayesian analysis using the model parameters from adults for estimation of individual 
parameters in children and adolescents; (ii) a common fit for data in adults, adolescents and children; and 
(iii) a procedure using a $PRIOR function based on the parameters from the model in adults for fitting the 
data in children and adolescents. Then, the best procedure was used to compare individually estimated 
exposures in children, adolescents and adults. The PK of HOE901-U300 was based on concentration data of 
its main metabolite M1. 
The following was concluded: 
• 
A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was developed. The first order 
absorption is described as the sum of a constant and a linear time dependent parameter. The model was 
developed under rich data conditions for adults and served as prior information for the model 
development in children and adolescents under the sparse data conditions in study EFC13957. The 
model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of Toujeo in children and in adults. 
• 
Age-dependent changes were fully explained by a body weight-based allometric equation with a fixed 
exponent of 0.75 for clearance and of 1 for volume of distribution. No age-dependent changes were 
observed for the absorption parameters. 
• 
In agreement with the allometric scaling principles, a slightly higher median weight-based dose in 
children led to similar Toujeo exposures in adults and children. The reason could be attributed to 
different dependencies of clearance and dose on weight. Theoretically, for a child weighing 20 kg, a 
1.4-fold higher weight-based dose is expected to lead to similar Toujeo exposures as in an adult 
weighing 75 kg. Accordingly, the same weight-based dose will lead to lower exposure in children 
compared to adults. 
• 
Estimating the starting dose for children in the same way as for adults is considered a suitable and safe 
approach. Afterwards, the maintenance dose of Toujeo will be adjusted individually depending on the 
therapeutic effects observed. 
Based on the goodness-of-fit plots, PK for the pivotal metabolite M1 in adults and children was adequately 
described in the final model. Comparison of the exposure to M1 by means of this popPK model demonstrated 
that the slightly higher dose applied in the paediatric study EFC13957 as compared to adults yielded 
comparable exposure. This may be due to somewhat increased clearance in children. Based on this outcome, 
when applying the same dose, exposure in children 6-<18 years of age will be somewhat lower than in 
adults. Therefore starting treatment of children applying the same starting dose as adults, with adjustment 
of the dose afterwards to achieve an adequate therapeutic response, appears a suitable and safe approach.  
With respect to the SmPC, in section 4.2 it is indicated that, like in adults, also in children a higher dose of 
Toujeo (10-18%) might be necessary when shifting from insulin glargine 100 IE/ml to Toujeo.  
Furthermore, the conclusion of the population PK analysis (POH0663), indicating that the same 
weight-based dose will lead to a lower exposure in children compared to adults, is reflected in the SmPC 
sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Insulin glargine is a recombinant analogue of human insulin. Insulin glargine, like human insulin, acts via the 
human insulin receptor system. The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of 
glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose

uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits 
lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The following dose-response analysis was performed (Analysis POH0706):  
The dose-response analysis aimed to describe the pharmacodynamics of Toujeo in children and adolescents 
aged 6-17 years diagnosed with T1DM with respect to HbA1c and to identify age-, weight- or other 
factor-dependent changes in HbA1c. This analysis was based on steady-state data from Phase 3 studies in 
children and adolescents (study EFC13957) and in adults (EFC12456) and was conducted in 2 steps: (i) an 
exploratory analysis using individually reported steady-state doses and; (ii) a regression analysis using 
individually reported changes in HbA1c and possible covariates influencing it. A longitudinal analysis was 
initially planned but omitted since practically no data were collected to describe the time-dependent changes 
in HbA1c. An exposure-response analysis was precluded by the lack of PK measurements in study 
EFC12456.  
Results: 
The individually reported steady-state doses per body weight were invariant to age, BMI and body weight for 
non-obese (BMI ≤30 kg/m2) patients. The average reported doses per body weight were higher for the 
paediatric population compared to the adult population. 
The scatter plots of various pairwise comparison of covariate factors with a change of HbA1c from baseline 
indicated, that there was no relevant correlation, even when the co-operation of multiple covariate factors 
was tested in the regression analysis. As no relevant correlation between the relationship of HbA1c to the 
baseline at steady state was identifiable for the paediatric and adult populations, the estimated 
dose-dependent parameter could not be reliably identified. The change of HbA1c from baseline was 
independent from the dose per body weight. 
Conclusions: 
•  Within the paediatric population (EFC13957) the individually reported doses per body weight at steady 
state were independent from body weight. The same was observed for the non-obese (BMI ≤30 kg/m2) 
adult population (EFC12456). 
•  The average reported doses per body weight were higher for the paediatric population (EFC13957) 
compared to the non-obese adult population (EFC12456). 
•  No correlation between the change of HbA1c from baseline at steady state and the individual dose at 
steady state per body weight could be detected. 
•  No differences between the paediatric population (EFC13957) and the adult population (EFC12456) could 
be identified with respect to the relationship of HbA1c to baseline at steady state. 
•  No relevant correlations between the investigated covariates and the relationship of HbA1c to baseline 
were observed. 
These data support that a dose adaptation in the paediatric population is not needed.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
2.4.2.1. 
 T1DM: Clinical efficacy Study EFC13957 (children with T1DM) 
The clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of Toujeo in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in paediatric 
population is based on a single phase 3b study lasting 12 months in which Toujeo was compared to Lantus 
in children and adolescent patients (aged 6 years to 17 years).  
The efficacy results are based on the main 6-months randomized period of this study. The 6 months safety 
extension is performed and submitted. An integrated analysis of efficacy data from more than one study was 
not performed as there are no other clinical studies in paediatric patients treated with Toujeo.

compare the efficacy of a new 
formulation of insulin glargine 
(Toujeo) to Lantus for change of 
HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 in 
children and adolescents with 
T1DM. The secondary objectives 
were to compare Toujeo and 
Lantus in terms of percentage of 
patients reaching target HbA1c 
(<7.5%) and target FPG value 
(≤130 mg/dL [7.2 mmol/L]) at 
Month 6 overall and without any 
episode of severe and/or 
documented hypoglycaemia during 
last 3 months of the main 
6-months randomized period; 
change from baseline to Month 6 in 
FPG; and change in mean SMPG 
(8-point SMPG profiles, glucose, 
variability of 24-hour mean plasma 
glucose) from baseline to Month 6. 
The safety of Toujeo was also 
assessed (including analysis of 
events of hypoglycaemia, 
hyperglycaemia with ketosis and 
development of anti-insulin 
antibody’s [AIAs]) and the extent 
of accumulation and metabolism of 
Toujeo versus Lantus.

Choice for patients from the age of 6 years and not from the age of 2 years, as is the case for Lantus, was 
due to the unavailability of a half unit injection device for Toujeo, which would have been necessary for the 
younger age-group.

Methods 
Study design 
The study consisted of a 2-weeks screening period, a 6-months comparative efficacy and safety treatment 
period, a 6-months comparative safety extension period, and a 4-weeks post-treatment follow up period.

Screening period; 
The screening phase lasted 2 weeks to randomization. 
Main 6-months open-label treatment period 
During the main 6-months treatment period, the doses of Toujeo and Lantus were optimally titrated to 
fasting (pre-prandial) self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) targets of between 90 and 130 mg/dL (5.0 and 
7.2 mmol/L), inclusive, while avoiding hypoglycaemia. Toujeo was administered in combination with 
fast-acting mealtime insulin analogue (i.e., glulisine, aspart, or lispro), administered and titrated (dose and 
timing) according to individual response and the product label.

Objectives 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of Study EFC13957 was to compare the efficacy of a more concentrated formulation 
of insulin glargine (Toujeo) to Lantus in terms of change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline 
to endpoint (Month 6/Week 26) in children and adolescents with T1DM. 
Key efficacy endpoints evaluated in this study are presented in Table 5:

Anti-insulin antibodies in relation to efficacy endpoint (HbA1c) 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and safety endpoints to evaluate the efficacy of 300 IU vs 100 
IU of insulin glargine in children and adolescents with T1DM by the change in HbA1c are in line with the 
Guideline CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 2 (draft). The 26-weeks data were submitted to evaluate the efficacy 
and the safety profile in the paediatric population and data from the 26-weeks safety extension arm. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy variable of HbA1c change from baseline to 
Month 6/Week 26. 
Assessment report

A sample size of 450 randomized patients (225 for Toujeo and 225 for Lantus) was ensured so that the upper 
bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean difference between Toujeo and 
Lantus would not exceed a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c with 92% power. This calculation assumed 
a common standard deviation of 0.95%, with a one-sided test at the 2.5% significant level and a true 
difference of zero in HbA1c between the treatment groups. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either Toujeo or Lantus once daily in an open-label manner 
during the 6-months treatment period and 6-months on-treatment extension period. Randomization was 
stratified by age group (<12 and ≥12 years) and by HbA1c (<8.5% and ≥8.5%) at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label, with an independent blinded external endpoint assessment committee for 
determination of relationship between increased AIA titer and impaired efficacy. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy assessments were performed on the main 6-months randomized period. 
The analysis population for efficacy was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized 
patients regardless of whether a treatment kit was used and analyzed according to the treatment group 
allocated by randomization (ITT estimand). 
The primary efficacy variable (change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26) was analyzed for non-inferiority 
assessment in the ITT population using all post-baseline HbA1c data available on the main 6-months 
randomized period (ie, ITT estimand). The non-inferiority of Toujeo versus Lantus was considered as 
demonstrated if this upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in the mean 
change in HbA1c between Toujeo and Lantus was <0.3%. The test for this primary endpoint was performed 
one-sided at level α = 0.025. Multiple imputation was performed for two subsets of the analysis population. 
Missing data in patients who prematurely discontinued IMP was imputed based on available week 26 data 
from discontinuers using a regression model. Missing data for patients who completed the 6-months 
treatment period, was imputed based on available baseline, week 12 and week 24 data from completers 
using the MCMC method followed by regression. The change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was then 
compared between treatment arms using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, including the fixed 
categorical effects of the treatment group, the randomization stratum of age group at screening visit (<12 
years and ≥12 years), as well as the continuous fixed covariates of the baseline HbA1c value. The method 
assumes data is missing within patient strata based on treatment status, sensitivity to this assumption was 
tested in tipping point analysis. Furthermore, the primary analysis was repeated in a per protocol set and in 
a supportive on-treatment analysis. 
A supportive analysis of the primary efficacy analysis was performed on the change in HbA1c from baseline 
to Week 26 in the ITT population during the main 6-months on-treatment period (on-treatment estimand). 
The supportive analysis used on-treatment HbA1c values only, first for missing data imputation then for 
analysis. 
As sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data, a tipping point analysis based on pattern 
mixture model approach using all HbA1c values available during the main 6-months randomized period was 
performed in the ITT population. 
A post-hoc per protocol (PP) population, defined as a subset of the ITT population, includes all randomized 
and exposed patients who did not permanently discontinue the IMP allocated by randomization during the

main 6-months treatment period, who performed Week 26 and had an available value for HbA1c change 
from baseline at Week 26, and who did not present any major or critical protocol deviations potentially 
impacting analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint during the main 6-months period. 
Efficacy endpoint (change in HbA1c) was analyzed in relation to anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) based on the 
safety population, for the main 6-months on-treatment period.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Patient disposition 
In the study, a total of 616 patients were screened in 105 study centres across 24 countries worldwide. Of 
these, 463 patients were randomized 1:1; 233 patients to Toujeo and 230 patients to Lantus.  
The most common reasons for screen failures were primarily attributed to: 
• 
exclusion criterion of HbA1c <7.5% or >10% at screening, or  
•  HbA1c <7.5% or >11% at screening (following protocol amendment 2).  
A high and comparable proportion of patients (Toujeo: 96.6%; Lantus: 93.9%) completed the 6-months 
treatment period. Treatment discontinuations due to AEs and lack of efficacy were low (≤0.4% for each 
reason) in both treatment groups. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was “other” 
reasons (Toujeo: 1.7%; Lantus: 3.5%) related to the patient’s personal situation (i.e., “patient too busy to 
complete study diary”, “patient moved” or “patient never started treatment”) and not safety-related (Table 
6). Data review and monitoring confirmed that the “other” category did not include discontinuation due to 
any of the pre-specified reasons, including AEs, hypoglycaemia or lack of efficacy. One patient in the Toujeo 
group who permanently discontinued the study during the main 6-months period, died during the study (PT: 
Completed suicide). The patient disposition is given below:

During protocol amendment 2, in order to facilitate the recruitment of patients, the upper limit of the HbA1c 
range was lifted from 10% to 11%, so that patients with an HbA1c of 10.1% to 11.0% at screening are not 
considered screening failures due to their HbA1c. 
The percentage of patients completing the 6-months study treatment was relatively high (95%), just as the 
percentage of patients completing the 6-months study period (98%). The randomised population in the two 
treatment groups was comparable with regard to patient disposition.

The primary analysis was performed also on the PP analysis set.  
A post-hoc per protocol (PP) population, defined as a subset of the ITT population, includes all randomized 
and exposed patients who did not permanently discontinue the IMP allocated by randomization during the 
main 6-months treatment period, who performed Week 26 and had an available value for HbA1c change 
from baseline at Week 26, and who did not present any major or critical protocol deviations potentially 
impacting analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint during the main 6-months period. 
Among all major or critical deviations presented in Table 7 of the 6-months CSR of Study EFc13957, the 
following deviations were considered as potentially impacting the efficacy and therefore were used to 
exclude patients from the post-hoc defined PP population: 
•  No baseline HbA1c value (included in the “Assessments/Procedures” category of the CSR table) 
•  Any major or critical deviations related to randomization procedures 
•  Any critical or major deviations related to prohibited medications

•  Any critical or major protocol deviations related to the Eligibility criteria impacting HbA1c: 
o 
I01 - Children and adolescents without T1DM for at least 1 year confirmed by typical 
symptoms at diagnosis and/or by antibody testing and/or clinical features (e.g., history of 
ketoacidosis) 
o  E01 - Age <6 and ≥18 years at V1 (screening) 
o  E08 - HbA1c <7.5% or >10% (or >11% following protocol amendment N°2) at screening 
•  Any critical or major protocol deviations leading to an insulin dose titration not done according to 
the Protocol (included in the “Assessments/Procedures” category of the CSR table). 
In addition to these major or critical protocol deviations, patients randomized and not treated and/or without 
on-treatment HbA1c value at Week 26 (i.e. missing primary endpoint) were also excluded from the post-hoc 
defined PP population due to the potential impact on efficacy analysis.  
Table 8 summarizes per treatment group the number of patients included in the post-hoc defined PP 
population and the reasons of patients’ exclusion from this population. In study EFC13957, more than 85% 
of the randomized population was included in the post-hoc defined PP population (91% of the randomized 
patients in the HOE901-U300 group and 88.3% of the randomized patients in the Lantus group). The main 
reason for exclusion from this population is the absence of an HbA1c value at Week 26 during the main 
6-months treatment period.

The analysis of the primary endpoint in the post-hoc defined PP population using changes in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 26 available during the main 6-months treatment period (on-treatment estimand) is 
provided in Table 9, using the same ANCOVA model as for the analysis of the primary endpoint done in the 
ITT population.  
Conclusion:  
Efficacy results of the primary endpoint analysis in the post-hoc defined PP population (on-treatment 
estimand [Table 9]) are consistent with those of the main primary endpoint analysis in the ITT population

Combined estimate for least-square (LS) means and standard errors (SE) are obtained by combining LS 
means and SE from analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the different imputed data sets, using Rubin's 
formulae 
The ANCOVA models include the fixed categorical effect of treatment group, the randomization stratum of 
age group at screening visit (<12 years and ≥12 years), as well as the continuous fixed covariates of the 
baseline HbA1c value 
The results were consistent with the primary analysis and support the conclusion of non-inferiority. 
In the primary model, the final analysis (using an ANCOVA model) is done using only HbA1c change at week 
26, either observed during the trial or imputed; in this approach, intermediate HbA1c values (i.e. at week 
12) have been used in the imputation model only in a sub-set of patients from the ITT population. 
The primary efficacy variable was analyzed using a multiple imputation approach to handle missing changes 
in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (primary endpoint) during the main 6-months randomized period (i.e. 
regardless of treatment discontinuation).  
The approach consisted of performing multiple imputations separately for two independent sub-sets of 
patients according to whether patients permanently discontinued the treatment during the main 6-months 
period or not: 
• 
In multiple imputation model for patients who did not permanently discontinue the IMP during the 
main 6-months period, all available post-baseline HbA1c values (including Week 12) were used to 
handle missing HbA1c changes from baseline to week 26.  
Whereas, for patients who permanently discontinued the IMP during the main 6-months period, a basic 
imputation model has been build, including only the treatment group as predictor. 
The primary efficacy variable, i.e. change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26, was analyzed in the ITT 
population during the main 6-months randomized period, i.e. regardless of treatment discontinuation (ITT 
estimand).   
Since the change from baseline at week 26 of HbA1c has not been observed for all patients included in the 
ITT population, a multiple imputation approach to handle these missing values has been used as further 
described below: 
The main concept of this multiple imputation was to differentiate among patients with no available HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 26: those who permanently discontinued the treatment during the main 
6-months period versus the ones who completed the main 6-months treatment period. The underlying idea

of differentiating the imputation between these 2 subsets of patients is that the behavior of missing data for 
those patients who are off-treatment during the main 6-months period may not be the same as that of 
observed data for those patients who are on-treatment in the same treatment arm.  
As a result, the multiple imputation approach consisted of performing 1,000 imputations separately for the 
two independent sub-sets of the ITT population according to whether patients permanently discontinued the 
treatment during the main 6-months period or not.

Missing primary endpoint in patients who prematurely discontinued IMP during the main 6-months period 
was imputed using a model estimated solely from the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 observed 
in other patients in the same treatment group who prematurely discontinue IMP during the main 6-months 
period and have the change in HbA1c available at Week 26. Due to the small number of these latter patients, 
a basic imputation model was built, including only the treatment group as predictor. Missing data was 
imputed using the regression method. 
Missing data were imputed 1,000 times. 
• 
Imputation part B: Imputation for missing data in patients who did not permanently discontinue the 
IMP during the main 6-months period 
It should be noted that only few patients who did not discontinue the treatment, have missing primary 
endpoint, i.e. change in HbA1c at Week 26 (N=4 in each treatment group).  Missing primary endpoint in 
patients who completed the main 6-months treatment period was imputed using a model estimated from 
baseline HbA1c and all available post-baseline on-treatment HbA1c during the main 6-months period (i.e. 
changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12 and Week 26) observed in any patients in the same treatment 
group who completed the main 6-months treatment period.  
Since in general, the missing pattern will not be monotone, a two-step approach was used: 
- 
Step 1: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used in conjunction with the 
IMPUTE=MONOTONE option to create an imputed data set with a monotone missing pattern 
(i.e. by patient, imputation of all missing HbA1c values before the last available HbA1c value 
during the main 6-months treatment period). The imputation model included the continuous 
fixed covariates of the baseline HbA1c value as well as the changes from baseline in HbA1c 
at Week 12 and Week 26. 
Missing data were imputed 1,000 times. 
- 
Step 2: using the monotone data set from step 1, remaining missing data during the main 
6-months treatment period was imputed for each of the 1,000 imputations using the 
regression method. The imputation model included the fixed categorical effects of the 
treatment group, the randomization stratum of age group at screening visit (<12 years and 
≥12 years), as well as the continuous fixed covariates of the baseline HbA1c value and the 
changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 12 and Week 26. 
Only one imputation was performed in this step 2 for each imputation from step 1. 
After having performed separately the imputations in the two independent sub-sets of patients, the two 
completed datasets with observed and imputed primary endpoints (1,000 imputations each) were gathered 
to obtain a single and complete dataset of the overall ITT population with 1,000 imputations (DataMI).  
For each imputation of the DataMI dataset, the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c (i.e. primary 
endpoint) was then analyzed in the ITT population using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), including the

fixed categorical effects of the treatment group, the randomization stratum of age group at screening visit 
(<12 years and ≥12 years), as well as the continuous fixed covariates of the baseline HbA1c value. The 
model provided baseline adjusted least squares (LS) means estimates at Week 26 for both treatment groups 
(using adequate contrasts at Week 26, based on the observed proportions of patients in the randomization 
age stratum and the observed baseline mean HbA1c in the ITT population), as well as the differences of 
these estimates with their corresponding SEs and 95% CIs.  
The final results were then obtained by combining the LS means and LS mean differences from these 1,000 
analyses, using Rubin’s formula. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
The demographic and other baseline characteristics including Tanner puberty stage distribution were well 
balanced between the two treatment groups and were considered to be representative of the general 
paediatric population with T1DM. 
The mean age of patients was 12.9 years with 30.9% patients aged <12 years and 69.1% patients aged ≥12 
years. Overall, 51.2% of patients were male, 30.2% of patients were Hispanic or Latino, and 92.1% were 
White. By Tanner stages, the majority of patients were adolescents (48.6%) while 26.5% were pre-pubertal 
and 24.9% were adults. At baseline, 62.4% of patients were within a healthy body mass index (BMI) range 
(5th-<85th percentile) while 17.1% of patients were obese (BMI ≥95th percentile).

Conduct of the study 
The mean duration of T1DM at study entry was approximately 6 years. The majority of patients had T1DM 
duration of ≥5 years (Toujeo: 52.8%; Lantus: 49.6%). 
A total of 461 patients (Toujeo: 233; Lantus: 228) were exposed to study treatment and were included in the 
safety population for analysis of exposure. The cumulative duration of treatment exposure during the main 
6-months on-treatment period was 113.02 patient-years in Toujeo and 111.38 patient-years in Lantus. The 
mean duration of exposure to study treatment was similar in both treatment groups (180 days [26 weeks] 
in Toujeo and 179 days [26 weeks] in Lantus). The majority of patients continued treatment beyond 25 
weeks, 92.7% for Toujeo and 93.4% for Lantus. 
Study EFC13957 allowed entry of a broad population of paediatric patients in terms of their baseline HbA1c 
as well as age and countries the study was conducted globally in 24 participating countries (including 13 EU 
countries as well as Serbia and North Macedonia).  The patients from Europe represented 46% of the 
randomized population.  
Therefore, the study population represents the intended target patient population. The study protocol was 
configured to ensure at least 30% of participants in the age range below 12 years which was achieved in 
order to ensure sufficient number of trial participants in the younger age group.

Although there are differences in glycaemic control across countries as well as paediatric diabetes centres, 
the mean HbA1c observed in the Study ECF13957 of 8.63% is corroborated by mean HbA1c reported from 
several large European clinical registries: the mean HbA1c in the Hvidore study of 2,873 T1D children from 
18 countries in Europe was 8.6%, the mean HbA1c observed among  37,539  paediatric T1D patients treated 
between 1995 and 2012 in Germany and Austria was 8.3%, and the mean HbA1c ranged from 7.7 to 8.6% 
in a paediatric population with T1DM in 4 Nordic countries.  In addition, the mean HbA1c among different age 
group patients included in a recent insulin study in paediatric population with T1DM ranged between 8.0- 
8.3%.  
In order to assess the  impact of the proportion of age strata and the baseline mean HbA1c used in the model 
on the estimation of the means  HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26 by treatment group, sensitivity 
analyses have been performed by varying these values (proportion of age stratum and mean HbA1c value) 
over a range of plausible values:  
• 
• 
Figure 2 illustrates the estimated means of HbA1c changes from baseline to Week 26 by treatment 
group based on the observed baseline mean HbA1c in the overall ITT population (i.e. 8.63%) and by 
varying the hypothetical proportions of age strata in the target population (from 15% to 45% of the 
patients below 12 years old).  
Figure 3 illustrates the estimated mean HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26 by treatment group 
based on the observed proportions of age strata in the overall ITT population (<12 years: 30.9%; 
≥12 years: 69.1%) and by varying the hypothetical value of baseline mean HbA1c in the target 
population (from 7.8% to 9.2%).  
These sensitivity analyses showed that: 
1- modifying the distribution of the randomization stratum of age (from 15% to 45% of patients <12 years 
old) has a limited impact on the estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 for both 
treatment groups (HOE901-U300: combined LS mean HbA1c change varies from -0.375% to -0.419%; 
Lantus: combined LS mean HbA1c change from -0.379% to -0.423). 
2- the mean decrease of HbA1c is, as expected, linked to the value of baseline HbA1c for both treatment 
groups: the smaller the baseline HbA1c value, the smaller the change from baseline will be. Indeed, for 
hypothetical mean HbA1c values varying from 7.8% to 9.2%, combined LS mean HbA1c change varies from 
-0.186% to -0.544% for the HOE901-U300 group, and from -0.190% to -0.548% for the Lantus group). 
Conclusion:  
The population assessed in study EFC13957 is sufficiently representative of the future target population in 
Europe. Additional analyses provided in the documentation shows that the distribution of the age strata does 
not impact the estimated HbA1c change from baseline for both treatment groups, and that the smaller the 
baseline HbA1c value, the smaller the change from baseline will be. Of note, whatever the distribution of the 
age stratum and the mean value of the baseline HbA1c considered in the statistical model, the difference 
between treatment groups remains exactly the same (LS mean difference of HOE901-U300 versus Lantus: 
0.004% [95%CI: -0.172 to 0.179], Table ) and do not impact the overall conclusion of the primary analysis.

The protocol ensured at least 30% of participants below 12 years and in a sensitivity analysis illustrated 
that the influence of age distribution on overall study results was minimal. 
The HbA1c values in this study are similar to the distribution found in several European registries, and 
although decrease of HbA1c was dependent on the baseline value this did not differ between treatment 
arms. 
The HbA1c and age distribution correspond to that of the intended treatment population.

The efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population and included 463 patients (233 in Toujeo and 230 
in Lantus). 
The study met its primary objective as non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was demonstrated for 
HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26. The least squares (LS) mean difference in HbA1c for Toujeo versus 
Lantus was 0.004% (95% CI [(-0.172 to 0.179]) with the upper bound of the 95% CI lower than the 
predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% ( 
Table 13). 
Statistical superiority of Toujeo over Lantus was not demonstrated (p-value=0.965).

Afterwards, in Week 12 to Week 26, there was a slight increase, although mean HbA1c levels were still lower 
than baseline after 26 weeks, for all patients. Also, the mean HbA1c levels overtime followed a similar trend 
in both treatment groups. Further, this course of the HbA1c curve in time is known for most trials in diabetic 
patients. 
The primary efficacy variables HbA1c and FPG were measured during the 6-months safety extension as well: 
HbA1c  at Week 38 and at Week 52 and FPG at Week 52. Efficacy data for the 12-months randomized period 
are presented through descriptive statistics, for the ITT population.

It can be concluded that the effect of Toujeo on change in HbA1c during 12-months of treatment was 
comparable to Lantus in children and adolescents (aged 6–17 years) with T1DM. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
The baseline mean FPG values were similar across the treatment groups (Toujeo: 11.25 mmol/L [202.70 
mg/dL]; Lantus: 11.35 mmol/L [204.51 mg/dL]). The LS mean reduction from baseline to Week 26 was

•  Average plasma glucose (8-point SMPG profiles) 
Based on 8-point SMPG profiles, the mean plasma glucose values at baseline were similar in both treatment 
groups (Toujeo: 189.48 mg/dL [10.52 mmol/L]; Lantus: 194.47 mg/dL [10.79 mmol/L]). The average 
24-hour plasma glucose remained stable at Week 26 in both treatment groups (Toujeo: 193.96 mg/dL 
[10.77 mmol/L]; Lantus: 187.85 mg/dL [10.43 mmol/L]). The reduction in average plasma glucose from 
baseline to Week 26 based on 8-point SMPG profiles was similar across the treatment groups (Toujeo: 4.48 
mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L]; Lantus: -6.62 mg/dL [-0.37 mmol/L]) (Figure ).

Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
•  Change in variability of 24-hour mean plasma glucose (8-point SMPG profiles) 
During the main 6-months treatment period, the change in variability of 24-hour mean plasma glucose 
based on 8-point SMPG profiles from baseline to Month 6 was similar in both treatment groups (Toujeo: 
1.46%; Lantus: 0.69%). 
•  Change in 8-point SMPG profiles per time-point 
At baseline and Week 26, the mean 8-point SMPG profiles at each time point, fluctuated throughout the day 
to a lesser extent in the Toujeo group compared to the Lantus group (Figure 9).  
In the Toujeo treatment group, SMPG values across 8-point SMPG profile were comparable between baseline 
and Week 26. In the Lantus treatment group, SMPG values at baseline were higher than at Week 26 between 
3.00 AM and post breakfast and lower than at Week 26 at pre-lunch.  
For all other time-points, the SMPG were comparable between baseline and Week 26.

•  Average pre-breakfast self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) 
The mean reduction in average pre-breakfast SMPG from baseline to Month 6 was slightly greater in the 
Toujeo group (-23.94 mg/dL [-1.33 mmol/L]) compared to Lantus group (-14.25 mg/dL [-0.79 mmol/L]), 
with LS mean difference of -4.115 mg/dL (-0.228 mmol/L). 
Daily basal insulin dose 
In both treatment groups, daily basal insulin dose increased over the course of the trial, with a greater 
increase in the Toujeo group compared to the Lantus group (HOE901-U300= Toujeo 
). The steepest increase in both treatment groups occurred during the first 12 weeks, which corresponded to 
the main dose titration period of investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
The mean daily basal insulin dose at baseline was similar in the 2 treatment groups. The mean percent 
change (%) in daily basal insulin dose (standard deviation [SD]) from baseline to Week 12 was higher in the 
Toujeo group (31.73% [30.55]) compared to the Lantus group (15.11% [23.71]). The mean daily basal 
insulin dose at Week 26 was 8% higher in the HOE901- U300 group (0.615 U/kg) than in the Lantus group 
(0.567 U/kg) which is consistent with findings in the EDITION program. Similarly, the mean change from 
baseline to Week 26 was higher in the Toujeo group (0.151 [0.152] U/kg) compared to the Lantus group 
(0.083 [0.140] U/kg).

Figure 10 Mean (+/- SE) average basal insulin dose (U/kg) by visit during the main 6-months on treatment 
period – Safety population 
HOE901-U300= Toujeo 
Consistently with the overall population, the increase in daily basal insulin dosing (U/kg) over time was 
greater in the Toujeo group than in the Lantus group across all Tanner puberty stages. The difference in dose 
between Toujeo and Lantus is already known as the formulations are not bioequivalent. However, after 12 
weeks, doses remained relatively constant, and no significant changes were seen between the 20 and 26 
weeks results. 
In both treatment groups, daily mealtime insulin dosing was relatively stable over the course of the trial.  
Across all Tanner puberty stages, the daily mealtime insulin dosing was relatively stable over the course of 
the trial in both treatment groups with a similar trajectory over time to the overall population. 
In both treatment groups, total (basal + mealtime) insulin dosing (U/kg) increased during the first 12 weeks 
of treatment and stabilized thereafter. 
Ancillary analyses 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses 
Efficacy results of the primary endpoint analysis in the post-hoc defined PP population (on-treatment 
estimand) are consistent with those of the main primary endpoint analysis in the ITT population. The LS 
mean difference in HbA1c for Toujeo versus Lantus was 0.059% (95%CI: -0.129 to 0.246) during the main 
6-months on-treatment period (on-treatment estimand) with the upper bound lower than the predefined 
non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. 
Results from the supportive analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint using all available post-baseline HbA1c 
data during the main 6-months on-treatment period (on-treatment estimand) indicated consistency with the 
results of the primary analysis. The LS mean difference in HbA1c for Toujeo versus Lantus was 0.026% 
(95%CI: -0.155 to 0.207) during the main 6-months on-treatment period (on-treatment estimand) with the 
upper bound lower than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.

Results of the sensitivity tipping point analysis confirmed the robustness of results of the primary efficacy 
endpoint analysis. Non-inferiority of Toujeo over Lantus was no longer demonstrated only in some extreme 
scenarios when missing HbA1c change value at Week 26 was highly penalized in the Toujeo group by more 
than 2.0% (no penalty was applied in the Lantus group). 
Results in the per protocol population and in the sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
In addition to the primary analysis, as supportive analysis, the primary endpoint (change in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 26) was analyzed by not including all post-baseline data regardless of treatment 
discontinuation (ITT estimand). Instead, only post-baseline HbA1c values measured under the IMP intake, 
i.e. during the main 6-months on-treatment period (On-treatment estimand), were included. This 
supportive analysis was performed in the whole ITT population as for the primary analysis.  
A multiple imputation approach followed by an ANCOVA was used to analyze the primary endpoint during the 
main 6-months on-treatment period. In the main analysis, for patients who discontinued the treatment, 
imputations were based on post-treatment values that are not used in this on-treatment supportive 
analysis. For this supportive analysis, the imputation could therefore not be done separately for patients who 
prematurely discontinued the treatment and for those who completed the main 6-months treatment period 
as done for the primary analysis. Consequently all missing changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 or 
available changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 measured after treatment discontinuation were 
imputed as follows:  
Missing data was imputed 1,000 times using a model estimated from baseline HbA1c and all post-baseline 
on-treatment HbA1c values observed during the main 6-months period in the whole ITT population. The 
imputation models (MCMC method to create dataset with a monotone missing pattern, then regression 
method) included all available on-treatment HbA1c changes from baseline (at week 12 and week 26) to 
handle missing primary endpoint. Each complete dataset with observed or imputed changes from baseline to 
week 26 was then analyzed using an ANCOVA model, including the fixed categorical effects of the treatment 
group, the randomization stratum of age group at screening visit (<12 years and ≥12 years), as well as the 
continuous fixed covariates of the baseline HbA1c value. The model provided baseline adjusted least squares 
(LS) means estimates at Week 26 for both treatment groups (using adequate contrasts at Week 26, based 
on the observed proportions of patients in the randomization age stratum and the observed baseline mean 
HbA1c in the ITT population), as well as the differences of these estimates with their corresponding SEs and 
95% CIs. Finally, combined results from these 1,000 analyses were obtained using Rubin’s formula. 
Subgroup analyses 
For each subgroup, the primary efficacy variable was analyzed using the ITT population. 
The treatment effect was consistent across most subgroups as defined by the baseline and demographic 
characteristics except for “screening HbA1c” subgroups (<8.5 and ≥8.5%); a significant 
treatment-by-subgroup interaction (p=0.0353) was reported for these two subgroups. The LS mean 
difference in HbA1c for Toujeo versus Lantus was -0.25% (95% CI [(-0.529 to 0.037]) for patients with a 
screening HbA1c <8.5% and 0.14% (95% CI [(-0.084 to 0.373]) for patients with a screening HbA1c 
≥8.5%.  
While the study was not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority in these subgroups, the upper bound of the 
95% CI is lower than 0.4% (former non-inferiority limit) and even lower than 0.3% for the subgroup of 
screening HbA1c <8.5% supporting the conclusion of non-inferiority of Toujeo versus Lantus in all patients, 
regardless of screening HbA1c level. More precisely, this interaction seems to come from an extreme low 
value of the LS mean change in HbA1c in the Lantus group of patients with HbA1c <8.5% at screening. 
Indeed, the LS mean change observed in the subgroup <8.5% are as expected, respectively for each

treatment group, lower than those in the subgroup ≥8.5% with the difference being greater in Lantus group 
than in Toujeo group. 
No significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was reported for other prespecified subgroups, including 
by randomization stratum of age, Tanner puberty stage, C-peptide, duration of diabetes, and eGFR 
categories. 
By randomization stratum of age (<12 years versus ≥12 years) 
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint by randomization stratum of age (<12 years versus ≥12 years) 
showed that the decrease in HbA1c was slightly more pronounced in patients from the younger age group 
than in older age group, with no difference between treatment arms. For patients <12 years of age, the 
mean LS reduction (SE) in HbA1c was -0.500 (0.113)% in the Toujeo group and -0.505 (0.114)% in the 
Lantus group, whereas for patients ≥12 years of age, the mean LS reduction (SE) in HbA1c was -0.353 
(0.076)% and -0.356 (0.076)% in the Toujeo and Lantus groups, respectively.

 T2DM: Extrapolation of adult T2DM and paediatric T1DM data to 
Introduction 
Study EFC13957 is the only study conducted with Toujeo in paediatric patients with T1DM. In support of 
treatment of paediatric patients with T2DM, a comparative analysis was performed to evaluate similarities in 
response to treatment with Toujeo in adult patients with T1DM (Study EFC12456) and T2DM (Studies 
EFC12347 and EFC11628), to support extrapolation from children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with 
T1DM (study EFC13957) to T2DM populations.  
Additionally, as further support of this extrapolation, a comparison of pathophysiology, disease progression, 
treatment recommendations in adults and paediatric patients has been provided, as well as an overview of 
external pharmacology and clinical response data for insulin treatment in paediatric T2DM, which is 
presented below. 
Paediatric T2DM pathophysiology 
The pathophysiology of paediatric T2DM appears to be similar to that in adults (Table 20 ). Nearly all youth 
with T2DM are obese and come from families and populations with a high prevalence and/or high risk of 
T2DM. Paediatric T2DM occurs most often during the second decade of life often overlapping with the 
physiologic rise in insulin resistance around puberty with a median age of diagnosis of 13.5 years. Although 
the incidence of T2DM in children and adolescents has been increasing globally, it is still a relatively low 
overall number of patients with an estimated prevalence in Europe of approximately 2.5:100000. However, 
a prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM as high as 6.7% was found in a large group of children 
and adolescents with obesity in Germany 
T1DM represents the most common form of diabetes in youth and has unique aspects of management in the 
paediatric population, such as changes in insulin sensitivity related to growth and sexual maturation, ability 
to provide self-care and supervision in the child care, adverse effects on cognition of hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia as well as effects of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

All types of diabetes result in hyperglycaemia and are diagnosed based on the same plasma glucose or 
HbA1c criteria. As in adults, T2DM in children and adolescents occurs when endogenous insulin secretion is 
not sufficient to meet the increased demand caused by insulin resistance, leading to relative insulin 
deficiency and consequently hyperglycaemia. Similarly to adult T2DM, T2DM in the younger age group is 
commonly associated with other metabolic abnormalities related to obesity and insulin resistance such as 
dyslipidemia, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome or fatty liver. 
Unlike T1DM, there is no identified autoimmune process leading to an absolute insulin deficiency in 
paediatric T2DM, which rather results from genetic, metabolic and socio-economical causes. 
Although insulin resistance occurs in both T2DM and T1DM, it is significantly more severe in paediatric T2DM. 
Furthermore, it appears that there are differences in insulin sensitivity and β-cell function between T2DM in 
youth and adults with similar degrees of hyperglycaemia that include greater insulin resistance for any 
degree of adiposity in paediatric T2DM. 
Paediatric T2DM disease progression 
Insulin secretion in paediatric T2DM depends on the disease status and can vary from a delayed and 
exaggerated response to absolutely diminished secretion over time. Studies showed that at the time of 
diagnosis, insulin secretion is already severely impaired in adolescents with T2DM, and the decline in insulin 
secretion is more rapid in adolescents compared to adults with T2DM as shown in the TODAY study. 
Moreover, several large studies indicate that diabetes related comorbidities such as kidney disease, 
retinopathy, neuropathy and hypertension are prevalent at the time of diagnosis in paediatric T2DM and 
increase rapidly over time. 
Paediatric T2DM disease manifestation and treatment recommendations 
Table 20  summarizes the characteristics of T1DM and T2DM in the different populations. 
The presentation of paediatric T2DM can vary from asymptomatic hyperglycaemia or glucosuria without 
ketonuria detected during a medical check-up or mild polyuria/polydipsia up to ketoacidosis or rarely 
hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state. Between 5% to 25% of paediatric T2DM patients have ketoacidosis at 
presentation. Consistent with the similar pathophysiology of T2DM in children and in adults a similar 
therapeutic approach is recommended, including lifestyle modification to support weight loss (diet and 
exercise). 
The glycaemic goals of initial treatment in paediatric T2DM are similar to those recommended in adults with 
an HbA1c of less than 7.0% and in some situations <6.5% (19). Long-term glycaemic control is more likely 
to be achieved if the therapy is intensified to maintain the HbA1c target (treat-to-target). The selection of 
the initial treatment is determined by the severity of the hyperglycaemia and its symptoms as well as the 
presence or absence of ketosis/ketoacidosis. Initial pharmacologic treatment in paediatric T2DM should 
include metformin alone or with insulin; in patients with ketosis/ketonuria/ketoacidosis or HbA1c >8.5% 
initial insulin treatment is usually required. A once-a-day intermediate or basal insulin is often effective in 
attaining metabolic control. Because adherence to insulin therapy is a challenge in youth with T2DM, 
treatment initiation with a single daily dose of a long-acting insulin analogue may be preferred. If the patient 
is started on metformin monotherapy and fails to reach target HbA1c of <7% or <6.5% within 4 months, 
addition of basal insulin should be considered. In some cases if life-style changes with or without 
concomitant metformin treatment are successful and result in reduction of body weight and improvement of 
glycaemic control, insulin treatment may be discontinued. Conversely, if HbA1c target is not attained on 
combination metformin and basal insulin, initiation of prandial insulin should be considered to reach 
glycaemic targets.

Overview of external pharmacology and clinical response data of insulin 
treatment in paediatric T2DM 
In order to review the published information on the clinical efficacy of insulin treatment in paediatric T2DM, 
a literature research was performed in Pubmed (focusing on the search terms ‘insulin’, ‘paediatrics or 
adolescents or youth’ and ‘type 2’ and the article type ‘clinical trial’). The literature research revealed three 
relevant clinical studies containing information on clinical efficacy of insulin treatment (Table 21).

treatment 
Abbreviations: IGT: Impaired glucose tolerance; SD: Standard deviation; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Study design and clinical efficacy 
The U100 formulation of insulin glargine (Lantus) is approved for the treatment of paediatric patients with 
T2DM and was investigated in this population in a recent clinical trial (Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) 
Paediatric Medication Study). In this study, 91 patients between 10-19 years of age were included, of which 
40% were patients with T2DM and 60% patients showed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Patients were

either drug-naïve or received metformin treatment prior to the start of the study. Mean HbA1c of the study 
population at baseline was 5.7%. The focus of this study was to investigate the effect of insulin glargine 
treatment on β-cell function (two coprimary surrogate endpoints derived from hyperglycaemic clamp 
studies). The study provided also information about the efficacy of insulin glargine in terms of HbA1c 
reduction. Although as expected no preservative effect on the β-cell function was observed, HbA1c 
decreased significantly (p<0.05) from baseline after 3 months of treatment with insulin glargine. The 
decrease in HbA1c from baseline after 3 months of treatment with insulin glargine was approximately 0.1%. 
Considering the low HbA1c of 5.7% at baseline, the fact that metformin was stopped at baseline, and the 
short treatment period, this change from baseline is considered to be indicative of the efficacy of insulin 
glargine in paediatric patients with T2DM. 
Two additional studies investigated the clinical efficacy of basal insulin treatment other than insulin glargine 
in T2DM paediatric populations characterized by higher baseline HbA1c values. Sellers and Dean assessed 
short-term insulin therapy (<16 weeks) with a pre-mixed 30/70 insulin in 18 adolescents with T2DM, aged 
10-18 years. The authors did not describe unambiguously the number of insulin-naïve patients. 
Acknowledging the high mean HbA1c value of 12.8% at baseline, a marked treatment effect was observed 
after up to 16 weeks (mean HbA1c value of 7.6% at end of study). 
In the recent study by Wheeler et al., efficacy and safety of long-term insulin treatment over 26 weeks was 
investigated in paediatric patients with T2DM (Table 21). In total, 42 patients, between 10 and 17 years of 
age were treated with either insulin detemir (Treatment 1) or NPH insulin (Treatment 2). Nine of the 42 
patients were insulin naïve. This study showed a decrease in HbA1c from 8.7% and 9.0% at baseline to 
8.11% in both groups after 26 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively. 
Insulin dosing 
For initiation of an insulin treatment, identifying a safe starting dose is crucial. In the three studies presented 
in this section, patients received starting doses that were safe and well tolerated (Table 22). 
• 
• 
• 
In the RISE Paediatric Medication Study, the paediatric patients with IGT received a starting dose of 
Lantus of 0.25 U/kg. For the paediatric patients with T2DM, the starting dose of Lantus of 0.4 U/kg was 
twice the proposed starting dose of Toujeo of 0.2 U/kg. After 11-12 weeks of individual titration to the 
fasting plasma glucose target value, the mean dose of Lantus clearly increased. No patients showed 
severe hypoglycaemia or acute metabolic decompensation. 
In the clinical study described by Sellers and Dean, paediatric patients received a starting dose of 0.5 
U/kg premixed 30/70 insulin split into two doses. Following individual titration, the maximum mean dose 
of 0.76 U/kg was achieved after 2-3 weeks. No hypoglycaemic events requiring external help occurred 
in this study. 
In the clinical study described by Wheeler et al, for insulin-naïve patients the same starting dose was 
administered in both treatment groups (i.e. for insulin detemir and NPH insulin). Patients who were 
treated with insulin already prior to study start received equivalent units of the respective study insulins. 
This resulted in mean insulin doses at baseline of 0.342 U/kg and 0.226 U/kg for insulin detemir and NPH 
insulin, respectively. After 26 weeks of individual titration to the fasting plasma glucose target value, the 
mean doses of the basal insulins clearly increased to 0.884 U/kg and 0.818 U/kg for insulin detemir and 
NPH insulin, respectively. During the study, no severe hypoglycaemic events were reported and the rate 
of symptomatic and confirmed hypoglycaemia was low for both basal insulins.

Limitations and conclusions  
The RISE Paediatric Medication Study provided limited information about the long-term efficacy of insulin 
glargine treatment in paediatric population with T2DM because Lantus was administered for 3 months. 
Furthermore, the study population did not exclusively comprise paediatric patients with T2DM but also youth 
with IGT. Finally, the low mean HbA1c value of 5.7% at baseline precluded a marked treatment response. 
Despite these limitations, the RISE Paediatric Medication Study indicated the efficacy of insulin glargine in 
paediatric patients with T2DM. 
In the study described by Sellers and Dean, treatment of a low number of paediatric patients with T2DM with 
a premixed insulin was investigated up to 16 weeks only. The insulin premix consisted of a basal insulin 
portion and a mealtime insulin portion, which confounds the treatment effect of the basal insulin portion. 
However, considering the marked observed treatment effect, it is reasonable to assume that the basal 
insulin portion contributed substantially to the overall efficacy. 
In the study described by Wheeler et al., the efficacy of basal insulins other than insulin glargine were 
investigated in two paediatric populations with T2DM. These paediatric populations comprised insulin-naïve 
and insulin-experienced patients with T2DM. An analysis of the treatment outcome in these two 
sub-populations was not performed. Despite this limitation, the analysis of the pooled data from both 
populations demonstrated the long-term (26 weeks) efficacy of insulin detemir and NPH insulin in the 
paediatric populations with T2DM. 
In summary, three studies were identified that assessed basal insulin treatment in paediatric patients with 
T2DM. In these studies, efficacy of insulin glargine administered as Lantus as well as of various other basal 
insulins in paediatric populations with T2DM was observed. Since insulin glargine lowers HbA1c, CHMP 
agrees that it is reasonable to assume that insulin glargine when administered as Toujeo is also effective in 
paediatric patients with T2DM. In all three studies, the basal insulins were shown to be safe and well 
tolerated. The starting doses were markedly lower than the individually up-titrated doses, indicating the 
safety of the selected starting doses. 
Extrapolation of adult T2DM and paediatric T1DM data to support use of Toujeo 
in paediatric patients with T2DM 
Methods 
A comprehensive extrapolation was made presenting qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the 
extrapolation of the data from adult T2DM patients and paediatric patients with T1DM to children and 
adolescents aged 6 years and older with T2DM.

Despite the differences in underlying pathophysiology between T1DM (autoimmune β-cell destruction, 
usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency) and T2DM (insulin resistance and progressive β-cell failure), 
both result in hyperglycaemia in adults, children, and adolescents.  
Response to treatment with Toujeo in both T1DM and T2DM patient populations and across age groups is 
expected to be similar for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
insulin is generally effective in reducing hyperglycaemia and attaining glycaemic targets in diabetes 
mellitus, 
Toujeo was shown to be effective in adult T1DM and across adult patients with T2DM using different 
treatment regimens, and  
insulin is always titrated to achieve individualized glycaemic targets. 
To support this hypothesis, the applicant has undertaken a qualitative comparison of the efficacy (and 
safety) data of Toujeo across different patient populations included in the Toujeo clinical development 
program:

All three adult studies were similar in design to each other and to study EFC13957 in paediatric patients. 
They were 6-months, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group studies comparing the efficacy 
and safety of Toujeo and Lantus injected once daily. 
The efficacy endpoints assessed were HbA1c and FPG. To leverage information on efficacy (and safety) in 
study patient populations considered as particularly relevant to paediatric patients with T2DM, several 
subgroups of interest were defined. 
1. Paediatric subgroups in study EFC13957 (T1DM): 
- Adolescents 10–18 years of age 
- Adolescents 10–18 years of age with a BMI ≥85th percentile at baseline 
2. Adult subgroups from insulin-naïve patients in study EFC12347 (T2DM): 
- Subjects on metformin prior to the study and continued metformin during treatment 
- Subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m² at baseline 
- Subjects by age categories <50, 50 - 65 and ≥65 years 
The above subgroups are considered particularly representative of children and adolescents with T2DM as 
obesity and concomitant metformin use are common in such patients. In addition, insulin dose data from 
study EFC12347 in insulin-naïve adult T2DM starting basal insulin in combination with oral anti-diabetic 
drugs (OAD) can be considered pertinent to support dosing information for adolescent patients with T2DM. 
The subgroups by age category in study EFC12347 will allow evaluation of insulin dose information and 
treatment effect across different age groups. 
All qualitative and quantitative analyses performed were descriptive and no formal statistical test was 
performed. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
The baseline characteristics of patients included in the four studies were representative for patients with 
T1DM as well as T2DM. As expected, the mean age and BMI were higher in the T2DM. The demographic and 
baseline characteristics (other than disease-related) were generally similar across the different subgroups of 
interest in the paediatric and insulin-naïve adult populations (Table 24).

Glycaemic control variables at baseline differed slightly in the four studies, but these differences were 
consistent with the type of patient population enrolled in each study. Mean HbA1c at baseline was highest in 
T1DM paediatric patients and in insulin-naïve T2DM adult patients, while mean FPG at baseline was highest

Insulin dosing 
In all 4 studies, the mean daily dose of Toujeo increased during the course of the study, and with a similar 
trajectory over time.

on-treatment period for Toujeo treatment group - Safety population 
HOE901-U300= Toujeo 
In all populations/studies the steepest dose increase occurred during the first 12 weeks, consistent with the 
main titration period. Mean daily dose levels varied depending on the study, with the highest mean doses 
overtime observed in advanced T2DM patients treated with basal-bolus regimen (study EFC11628). 
The mean change in daily basal insulin dosing (Toujeo) from baseline to Month 6 was higher in T2DM 
patients than in T1DM patients.  
Small increases in daily mealtime insulin doses were observed across adult studies (except Study 
EFC12347 with a basal-OAD regimen). At Month 6, the mean mealtime insulin dose was lowest in adult 
T1DM patients. 
Efficacy  
The HbA1c and FPG data across the four studies indicate a similar treatment response to Toujeo in both 
T1DM and T2DM patients.

rescue and during the 6-months on-treatment period are presented. 
The trajectories of the reductions in HbA1c and FPG over time were similar in all studies, although greater in 
T2DM patients than in T1DM patients. HbA1c and FPG levels both decreased primarily during the first 12 
weeks of treatment, corresponding to the initial titration period, and thereafter continued to decrease 
gradually or remained stable (Figure 12 and Figure 13).

At Month 6, mean HbA1c levels were higher in T1DM patients, particularly in paediatric patients, than in 
adult T2DM patients. 
Consistent with HbA1c reduction, FPG decreased in all studies, as expected with a greatest reduction 
observed in T2DM patients, and particularly in insulin-naïve patients (Figure 13).

Reductions in HbA1c and FPG across the different subgroups of interest in the paediatric T1DMpatients and 
insulin-naïve adult populations were similar and consistent with the results observed across the total 
populations of the four studies. 
Efficacy discussion and conclusions 
Treatment with Toujeo in individually titrated adult patients with T1DM and T2DM in studies EFC12456, 
EFC11628 and EFC12347 as well as paediatric T1DM patients was effective in improving glycaemic control as 
demonstrated by lowering of mean HbA1c and mean FPG from baseline. The reductions in HbA1c and FPG 
are similar and seem to follow a similar pattern of response in adults and children. These results sufficiently 
support that Toujeo will also be effective in children with T2DM.  
Overall, the evaluated efficacy parameters were consistent across the patient populations and different 
subgroups with characteristics considered to be particularly relevant for the paediatric T2DM population. The 
magnitude of treatment response was similar between adult and paediatric T1DM patients, while it was more 
pronounced in T2DM patients, particularly as expected in insulin initiating T2DM patients. Overall, the 
available efficacy data with Toujeo is considered to be applicable to the paediatric T2DM population.

Safety T2DM 
Incidence of hypoglycaemia 
As expected, more patients with T1DM and advanced T2DM patients treated with basal bolus regimen 
experienced at least one event of any hypoglycaemia during the main 6-months TEAE period compared to 
insulin-naïve T2DM patients who initiated a basal-supported oral therapy regimen (Table 27 ). In addition, 
more patients with T1DM experienced at least one nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (in any category) than 
T2DM patients (Table 28 ). 
During the first 8 weeks of study treatment, when most of the increase of the basal insulin dose occurred 
(titration period), the percentage of T1DM patients reporting at least one event of hypoglycaemia of any 
category was similar to that reported during the maintenance treatment period. More T2DM patients 
reported at least one event of any hypoglycaemia during the maintenance period compared to the titration 
period.

Serious hypoglycaemia was more frequently reported in T1DM paediatric and adult patients, however, it also 
occurred in advanced T2DM patients treated with basal bolus regimen:

Based on these observations, it is therefore reasonable to expect that the risk of hypoglycaemia in 
Toujeo-treated patients would not be increased in children and adolescents with T2DM compared to those 
with T1DM. 
Percentages of adult and paediatric patients with at least one hypoglycaemic event, and for a severe event, 
were highest for T1DM patients, less frequent for T2DM adults, and still lower for the insulin-naïve T2DM 
adults. The same pattern was seen for nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The results do not point towards a different 
risk of hypoglycaemia in the paediatric population with T2DM. 
Significant adverse events: hypersensitivity 
The proportion of patients with hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions was low in the T1DM 
and T2DM trials. In T1DM paediatric patients, the proportion of patients with either hypersensitivity 
reactions or injection site reactions was similar across the two subgroups of interest. In insulin-naïve adult 
patients, the proportion of patients with either hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions was 
similar across the different subgroups of interest (Table 31 ).

During 6 months of treatment, the percentage of Toujeo-treated patients with at least 1 TEAE, including 
hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions, was similar between the T1DM and T2DM studies for 
the overall populations and across the different subgroups of interest. Anti-insulin antibody response was 
also similar across the studies. 
Anti-insulin antibodies 
Anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) results were similar in studies EFC12456, EFC11628 and EFC13957 (all in 
patients already receiving insulin at baseline). Of the patients with a negative antibody status at baseline, a 
conversion to positive status occurred at least once during 6-months treatment period with Toujeo in 48.5%, 
39.0%, and 36.7% of patients, respectively (Table 32 ), whereas the reverse conversion from a positive AIA 
status at baseline to negative status occurred in a smaller number of patients in the 3 trials (3.6%, 9.4%, 
and 2.8%, respectively).

Results were slightly different in insulin-naïve T2DM patients (Study EFC12347), as conversion from 
negative status at baseline to positive status occurred in 76/391 patients (19.4%) during 6-months 
treatment period with Toujeo, while reversion from positive status at baseline to negative status occurred in 
5/23 of patients (21.7%). 
In T1DM paediatric patients, similar AIA results were observed across the two subgroups of interest. In 
insulin-naïve adult patients, similar AIA results were observed across the different subgroups of interest. 
Safety discussion T2DM 
Comparison of hypoglycaemia event data across the four studies used in this extrapolation showed that the 
paediatric and adult patients with T1DM or advanced T2DM treated with basal-bolus regimen experienced, in 
general, more (severe) hypoglycaemia/(severe) nocturnal hypoglycaemia during the main 6-months TEAE 
period compared to adult insulin-naïve T2DM patients. This is expected based on their disease background. 
However, in the paediatric study, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar in the Toujeo and the Lantus 
group. The incidence of hypoglycaemia per type of hypoglycaemia did not show unexpected numbers or 
trends. 
Percentages of adult and paediatric patients with any (serious) treatment emergent adverse event were 
similar.  
Percentages of adult and paediatric patients with at least one hypersensitivity reaction or injection site 
reaction, were in the similar range.  
Anti-insulin antibody response was similar across patients in the four studies. Conclusions on the evidence 
supporting use of Toujeo in paediatric T2DM 
Safety parameters were in the same range for adults and children with T1DM. The results do not point 
towards a different risk for children or adolescents with T2DM, compared to adults with T2DM. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy in paediatric patients with T1DM 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support the efficacy (and safety) of Toujeo in paediatric patients with T1DM, the applicant performed 1 
phase 3b study in which Toujeo was compared with Lantus (Study EFC13957). In general, the design and 
statistical analysis are overall considered acceptable. 
In the study, a total of 616 patients were screened in 105 study centres across 24 countries worldwide. Of 
these, 463 patients were randomized 1:1; 233 patients to Toujeo and 230 patients to Lantus. During the 
6-months on-treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment was 3.4% in the 
Toujeo group compared with 5.2% in the Lantus group. A similar percentage of patients discontinued due to 
TEAEs (Toujeo: 1 patients [0.4%] and Lantus: 1 patients [0.4%]). There were no relevant differences 
between groups in percentage of patients for each reason of treatment discontinuation. There was 1 death 
during the study, which concerned a patient in the Toujeo overall group (0.4%). 
Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar between treatment groups. The mean age of 
patients was 12.9 years with 30.9% patients aged <12 years and 69.1% patients aged ≥12 years. Overall, 
51.2% of patients were male, 30.2% of patients were Hispanic or Latino, and 92.1% were White. By Tanner 
stages, the majority of patients were adolescents (48.6%) while 26.5% were pre-pubertal and 24.9% were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/596054/2019

adults. At baseline, 62.4% of patients were within a healthy body mass index (BMI) range (5th-<85th 
percentile) while 17.1% of patients were obese (BMI ≥95th percentile). 
At baseline, a total of 461 patients (Toujeo: 233; Lantus: 228) were exposed to study treatment and were 
included in the safety population for analysis of exposure. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The LS mean difference in HbA1c between baseline and week 26 for Toujeo versus Lantus was 0.004% (95% 
CI [(-0.172 to 0.179]) with the upper bound of the 95% CI lower than the predefined non-inferiority margin 
of 0.3%. Non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was demonstrated for HbA1c change from baseline to 
Week 26. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was met. These results are confirmed also by an 
analysis on the PP population. 
For both groups, there was a decrease in the primary endpoint mean-HbA1c-change during the first 12 
weeks of the study. Afterwards, in Week 12 to Week 26, values stabilized although there was a slight 
increase. However HbA1c levels were still lower than baseline after 26 weeks, for all patients. Also, the mean 
HbA1c levels overtime followed a similar trend in both treatment groups. Further, this course of the HbA1c 
curve in time is known for most trials in diabetic patients.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints between Week 26 and baseline are in support of the reduction in HbA1c, 
with similar values and trends. The reduction in mean FPG over time was similar in both treatment groups. 
Responder rates for the pre-specified target HbA1c of <7.5% at Week 26 and for the pre-specified target 
FPG (≤130 mg/dL [7.2 mmol/L]) during the last 3 months of the main 6-months randomized period was 
similar in the two treatment groups. The reduction in average plasma glucose from baseline to Week 26 
based on 8-point SMPG profiles was similar across the treatment groups at Week 26. With regard to the 
change in 8-point SMPG profiles per time-point, at baseline and Week 26, the mean 8-point SMPG profiles at 
each time point, fluctuated throughout the day to a lesser extent in the Toujeo group compared to the Lantus 
group. 
Mean daily insulin dose increased in all treatment groups during the first weeks, but the increase was larger 
with Toujeo as compared to Lantus. The difference in dose between Toujeo and Lantus is already known: 
both formulations are not bioequivalent. However, after 12 weeks, doses remained relatively constant, and 
no significant changes were seen between 6 months and 12 months results. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The scope of this application is to extend the indication for use in children from 6 years and above. 
To support the efficacy and safety of Toujeo in paediatric patients with T1DM, the applicant performed 1 
phase 3b study in which Toujeo was compared with Lantus (Study EFC13957) in children and adolescents 
with T1DM, of which the first 26 weeks were submitted to support efficacy. At baseline, a total of 461 
patients (Toujeo: 233; Lantus: 228) were exposed to study treatment. Baseline characteristics and 
demographics were similar between treatment groups. Non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was 
demonstrated for HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26.  
The LS mean difference in HbA1c between baseline and week 26 for Toujeo versus Lantus was 0.004% (95% 
CI [(-0.172 to 0.179]). Non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was demonstrated for HbA1c change from 
baseline to Week 26. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was met. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints between Week 26 and baseline are in support of the HbA1c results, with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/596054/2019 
Page 55/82 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
similar values and trends. The baseline mean FPG values were similar across the treatment groups (Toujeo: 
11.25 mmol/L [202.70 mg/dL]; Lantus: 11.35 mmol/L [204.51 mg/dL]). The LS mean reduction from 
baseline to Week 26 was similar for both treatment groups (Toujeo: 0.56 mmol/L [10.15 mg/dL]; Lantus: 
0.55 mmol/L [9.89 mg/dL]). 
In support of treatment of paediatric patients with T2DM, a comparative analysis was performed to evaluate 
similarities in response to treatment with Toujeo in adult patients with T1DM (Study EFC12456) and T2DM 
(Studies EFC12347 and EFC11628), to support extrapolation from children and adolescents (aged 6-17 
years) with T1DM (study EFC13957) to T2DM populations. Additionally, as further support of this 
extrapolation, a comparison of pathophysiology, disease progression, treatment recommendations in adults 
and paediatric patients has been provided, as well as an overview of external pharmacology and clinical 
response data for insulin treatment in paediatric T2DM.  
Treatment with Toujeo in individually titrated adult patients with T1DM and T2DM in studies EFC12456, 
EFC11628 and EFC12347 as well as paediatric T1DM patients was effective in improving glycaemic control as 
demonstrated by lowering of mean HbA1c and mean FPG from baseline. Overall, the evaluated efficacy 
parameters were consistent across the patient populations and different subgroups with characteristics 
considered to be particularly relevant for the paediatric T2DM population. The magnitude of treatment 
response was similar between adult and paediatric T1DM patients, while it was more pronounced in T2DM 
patients, particularly as expected in insulin initiating T2DM patients. Overall, the available efficacy data with 
Toujeo is considered to be applicable to the paediatric T2DM population. 
2.5.  Clinical safety  
Introduction 
In Study EFC13957, the safety endpoints included: 
•  Hypoglycaemia 
•  Hyperglycaemia with ketosis 
• 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) (including injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions), 
AEs leading to death, adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug, serious 
AEs (SAE) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) defined for the study as symptomatic 
overdose with IMP/non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP), increased alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels (≥3 x upper limit of normal), and pregnancy 
•  Anti-insulin antibody (AIA) in relation to hypoglycaemia and TEAEs including injection site and 
hypersensitivity reactions 
•  Other safety variables: chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters, physical examinations, 
vital signs, BMI percentiles, and Tanner puberty stage (pre-pubertal, adolescent, adult). 
All safety analyses were performed using the safety population, defined as the randomized population who 
received at least 1 dose of IMP, and was analyzed according to treatment received rather than according to 
the randomization group. No statistical testing was performed on safety parameters for between-group 
differences. 
Beside Study EFC13957, there are no other clinical studies in the paediatric population; therefore, no pooling 
of studies was performed for integrated safety analysis.

Patient exposure 
The study treatment exposure during the main 6-months on-treatment period was considered to be 
adequate and appropriate to make valid safety conclusions. Mean exposure was similar in both treatment 
groups, 180 days (26 weeks) for Toujeo and 179 days (26 weeks) for Lantus. Most patients were treated for 
more than 25 weeks, 92.7% for Toujeo and 93.4% for Lantus. 
Adverse events 
During the main 6-months TEAE period, the percentage of patients with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs 
leading to death or permanent treatment discontinuation was similar in the Toujeo and Lantus groups (Table 
34 ).

The most commonly reported TEAEs (i.e., ≥10% of patients in either group) at the primary SOC level with 
a similar percentage of patients in the Toujeo and Lantus groups, respectively were infections and 
infestations (41.6% and 46.1%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (14.6% and 9.6%), Nervous system Disorders 
(12.4% and 9.2%), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (12.0% and 5.3%) Metabolism and 
Nutrition disorders (11.2% and 16.7%) and General disorders and administration site conditions (10.3% 
and 9.6%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT in the Toujeo and Lantus groups, respectively were 
nasopharyngitis (12.9% and 13.6%), headache (7.3% and 5.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.9% 
and 5.7%), and ketosis (6.4% and 10.1%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Severity 
Treatment-emergent AEs were predominantly of mild to moderate intensity. In both treatment groups, the 
most frequently reported severe TEAEs by PT were hypoglycaemic unconsciousness (Toujeo: 2.1%; Lantus: 
3.1%) and hypoglycaemic seizure (Toujeo: 1.3%; Lantus: 3.1%). 
Causality 
The proportions of patients with at least one TEAE considered related to IMP were low and comparable 
between the two treatment groups, 6.0% for Toujeo and 8.3% for Lantus.

No unexpected safety issues have occurred. In general, the spectrum of related adverse advents for this 
6 months of treatment was comparable between the Toujeo and the Lantus group and in line with 
section 4.8 of the SmPC for Toujeo for adults.  
Deaths 
During the main 6-months TEAE period, 1 patient from the Toujeo group reported 2 treatment-emergent 
SAEs (PTs: Fall and Completed suicide) leading to death on Day 147 of the study. This fatal event was 
considered not related to the IMP. 
Serious adverse events 
The percentage of patients who experienced SAEs was similar in both treatment groups: 7.3% and 9.2% for 
Toujeo and Lantus, respectively.  
The SOC with the highest proportion of SAEs in the Toujeo group was Nervous System Disorders (3.0% 
versus 4.4% in the Lantus group). Most of these events were hypoglycaemia-related. The number of 
patients with at least one serious TEAE of hypoglycaemia was numerically lower in the Toujeo group (2.6%) 
versus Lantus group (4.4%). In each treatment group, 1.3% of patients reported serious TEAEs of 
hypoglycaemia related to IMP. No serious hypoglycaemic event led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the paediatric study, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions reported was also slightly higher for 
Toujeo: 7.3% for Toujeo and 4.8% for Lantus after 6 months. The effect of the higher concentration of the 
injected fluid for Toujeo, or the age of children may make them more susceptible.

The applicant was requested to provide an overview of incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. 
From the non-clinical toxicology evaluation, no specific effect of the higher concentration of the injected 
fluid for Toujeo was to be expected. From the available data on background occurrence of hypersensitivity 
reactions in children with T1DM compared to children from the general population, no suggestion of a 
difference was observed.  
In the paediatric study there was a slight imbalance in medical history, with 9 of 17 (52.9%) patients with 
hypersensitivity reaction on Toujeo having a confounding factor for hypersensitivity compared to 4 of 11 
(36.4%) patients on Lantus. In those cases the hypersensitivity reaction was not suggestive of a causal 
association with Toujeo or Lantus. 
In the 6-months safety extension period, the number of cases was balanced, as 4 patients in each 
treatment group experienced hypersensitivity reactions. After the complete 12-months study period, the 
incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 9.0% for Toujeo and 6.6% for Lantus.  
Further, it may be possible that the higher reporting rates of hypersensitivity during the main 6-months 
part of the study were related by the the open-label design, leading to more reported events in the Toujeo 
group, being the investigational medicine. 
From the data presented by the applicant it can be concluded that there is no suggestion that Toujeo, due 
to the higher concentration of the injected fluid than the control, may cause more hypersensitivity 
reactions. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, the percentages of patients with a potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) in clinical 
laboratory variables were similar between the Toujeo and Lantus treatment groups. No hematologic or 
biochemical safety signals were detected in either treatment group. No relevant mean changes from 
baseline to Week 26 were reported for any of the renal or hepatic function parameters in either treatment 
group. Across the subgroup of age (<12 and ≥12 years), the results were consistent with that of the overall 
population. 
No PCSA in hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters was reported as a serious TEAE or TEAE leading to 
permanent treatment discontinuation during the main 6-months TEAE period. 
No patient in either treatment group had hepatic enzyme elevations that met the clinical criteria for Hy’s law, 
and no drug-induced liver toxicity was reported during the main 6-months TEAE period. 
CHMP concluded that no unexpected safety issues have occurred within the routine laboratory parameters, 
nor were any relevant changes from baseline reported in both treatment groups.  
Safety in special populations 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia events were not considered as AEs except for events resulting in seizure, unconsciousness, 
or coma and for any other hypoglycaemia event fulfilling the criteria of an SAE.

Incidence of hypoglycaemia 
During the main 6-months TEAE period, almost all patients had at least one event of ‘any’ hypoglycaemia at 
any time of the day (Toujeo: 97.9%; Lantus: 98.2%) (Table 36). The percentage of patients with at least 
one nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (in any category) was also similar in both treatment groups (Toujeo: 
73.0%; Lantus: 71.9%). 
Severe hypoglycaemia at any time of the day was reported by 14 patients (6.0%) in the Toujeo group and 
20 patients (8.8%) in the Lantus group. Severe hypoglycaemia during the nocturnal period (00:00-05:59) 
was reported by 7 patients in each treatment group. For the composite categories of severe and/or 
documented hypoglycaemia (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] and <3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]), the incidence 
at any time of day and during the nocturnal period was similar between treatment groups. None of the 
patients permanently discontinued treatment due to the severe hypoglycaemia event.

and ISPAD classification) during the main 6-months TEAE period - Safety population 
From first injection of IMP to end of Week 8 covering the time of the insulin change-over and initial titration 
of IMP, the percentage of patients with at least one event of ‘any’ hypoglycaemia was similar in the Toujeo 
group (94.0%) and the Lantus group (96.1%). Similar results were observed from the start of Week 9 to 
Month 6 (Toujeo: 92.7%; Lantus: 93.9%). 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia (00:00 – 05:59) 
Across ADA and ISPAD-defined categories, a similar percentage of patients in the Toujeo and Lantus groups 
reported at least one event of nocturnal hypoglycaemia (00:00 - 05:59) (Toujeo: 73.0%; and Lantus: 
71.9%) including ‘severe’ nocturnal hypoglycaemia (Toujeo: 3.0%; and Lantus: 3.1%) (Figure 8). This 
finding was corroborated by the analysis of nocturnal hypoglycaemia events defined by sleep status, where 
the incidence was also comparable between treatment groups.

Lantus: 92.66; nocturnal: Toujeo: 8.56 and Lantus: 8.22) with the exception of severe hypoglycaemia. This 
was mainly due to a difference in day time hypoglycaemia but was also seen, to a lesser extent, in the 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia. In the initial application, it was shown that mealtime insulin in combination with 
basal insulin contributes to the increase in the number of daytime hypoglycaemia events.

Distribution of severe and/or documented hypoglycaemia 
Over the 24-hour day, the percentage of patients with severe and/or documented hypoglycaemia events 
(SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) was similar between treatment groups. The cumulative mean number of 
severe and/or documented hypoglycaemia events (SMPG ≤70 mg/dl [3.9 mmol/L]) per patient increased 
with a very similar pace over time in both treatment groups (Figure 11).

Likewise, the cumulative mean number of severe and/or documented (≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) nocturnal 
(00:00 - 5:59) hypoglycaemia event per patient increased with a very similar pace over time in both 
treatment groups. 
Blinded external endpoint assessment committee review of severe hypoglycaemia 
The independent blinded committee reviewed all severe or possibly severe hypoglycaemia events reported 
during the main 6-months treatment period, representing a total of 52 events in 34 patients. All but one of 
these events were classified by the Committee as severe hypoglycaemia. For the event not confirmed to be 
severe hypoglycaemia, the patient was considered as capable of treating themselves but received 
assistance. 
Subgroup analyses of hypoglycaemia 
Across the prespecified subgroups, the treatment effect was consistent with the results for the overall study 
population at any time of the day. During the nocturnal period (00:00-5:59) the treatment effect was 
consistent with the results for the overall study population, with the exception of the gender subgroup which 
showed a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (p-value 0.0254). The percentage of patients with 
at least one severe and/or documented nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) in 
the Toujeo group was lower than the Lantus group in male patients (64.8% vs. 74.3%), and higher than the 
Lantus group in female patients (76.2% vs. 66.4).

Subgroups of patients <12 and ≥12 years of age 
In both treatment groups, the percentage of patients <12 years of age with at least one severe and/or 
documented (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) hypoglycaemia event was comparable at any time of the day 
(Toujeo: 97.3%; Lantus group: 97.1%) and during the nocturnal period (Toujeo: 69.9%; Lantus group: 
60.9%). Similarly, the percentage of patients ≥12 years of age with at least one severe and/or documented 
(SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) hypoglycaemia event was similar in both treatment groups at any time of 
the day (Toujeo: 96.9%; Lantus group: 98.1%) and during the nocturnal period (Toujeo: 70.0%; Lantus 
group: 74.2%).  
Tanner puberty stage 
In both treatment groups, the percentage of adolescent patients with at least one severe and/or 
documented (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) hypoglycaemia event was comparable at any time of the day 
(Toujeo: 97.5%; Lantus group: 99.0%) and during the nocturnal period (Toujeo: 71.1%; Lantus group: 
72.8%). Similar results were reported for the other Tanner puberty stages (i.e., pre-pubertal and adult). 
Supportive analysis based on all low SMPG 
A sensitivity analysis based on all SMPG values measured by the study glucometers was performed and 
revealed no differences between treatment groups with respect to the percentage of patients with SMPG 
values ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) (Toujeo: 97.9%; Lantus: 96.9%). 
Hypoglycaemia conclusions 
During the main 6-months TEAE period, the majority of patients had at least one event of ‘any’ 
hypoglycaemia, 97.9% for Toujeo and 98.2% for Lantus. 
Across the ADA and ISPAD-defined categories of hypoglycaemia, at any time of the day and during the 
nocturnal period, the percentages of patients and event rates per patient-year of exposure were similar in 
both treatment groups, except for severe hypoglycaemia, where the incidence (and event rates) at any time 
of the day was numerically lower in the Toujeo group (6.0% [0.18]) compared to the Lantus group (8.8% 
[0.27]), with a relative risk of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.35 to 1.30). 
No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to a hypoglycaemia event.  
Analyses of the incidence of severe and/or documented hypoglycaemia (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) by 
subgroups (randomization stratum of age group [<12 and ≥12 years], randomization stratum of screening 
HbA1c [<8.5%, ≥8.5 %], baseline BMI percentile, baseline Tanner puberty stage and baseline prebreakfast 
SMPG) showed consistent results with the overall population at any time of the day and during the nocturnal 
period. For the subgroup of gender, the percentage of patients with at least one severe and/or documented 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (SMPG ≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) was respectively 64.8% in the Toujeo 
group versus 74.3% in the Lantus group in the males patients and 76.2% in the Toujeo group versus 66.4% 
in the Lantus group among the female patients (Section 11.2.6). 
From first injection of IMP to end of Week 8, covering the time of the insulin change-over and initial titration 
of Toujeo and Lantus, the incidence of at least one event of “any” hypoglycaemia was similar in the Toujeo 
group (94.0%) and the Lantus group (96.1%). 
For event rates per patient-year of exposure, the values were numerically lower for “any” hypoglycaemia in 
the Toujeo group (92.06) compared to the Lantus group (100.03), with a relative risk of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.76 
to 1.07).

In summary, over 26-weeks of treatment in paediatric patients with T1DM, Toujeo had a similar 
hypoglycaemia incidence and event-rate compared to Lantus across all categories but severe 
hypoglycaemia. For severe hypoglycaemia, a numerically lower incidence and event-rate was observed 
among Toujeo-treated patients. Change-over from pre-study Lantus basal insulin formulation to Toujeo and 
up-titration of the Toujeo dose over the initial 8-weeks treatment period was accompanied with a 
numerically lower event rate for “any” hypoglycaemia in the Toujeo group compared to the Lantus group. 
Other significant adverse events 
Hyperglycaemia with ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis 
The proportion of patients with at least one TEAE of hyperglycaemia and ketosis was numerically lower in the 
Toujeo group (6.4% [15 patients]) compared to the Lantus group (11.8% [27 patients]) (Table 38). 
One patient (0.4%) in the Toujeo group and 4 patients (1.8%) in the Lantus group reported TEAE of DKA. 
The number DKA events and event rate per patient-years was 1 [0.01] in the Toujeo group compared to 5 
[0.04] the Lantus group. Diabetic ketoacidosis was reported as a serious TEAE in 1 patient (0.4%) in the 
Toujeo group and 2 patients (0.9%) in the Lantus group. None of these TEAEs were considered related to 
IMP.

Hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions 
Treatment-emergent injection site reactions were reported by low and comparable percentages of patients 
in both treatment groups, 4.7% for Toujeo and 5.7% for Lantus. The most commonly reported PTs were 
injection site pain (2.1% for Toujeo and 1.3% for Lantus) and injection site atrophy (1.7% for Toujeo and 
2.6% for Lantus). None of the events was severe in intensity and the events were considered related to the 
IMP in 2.6% of patients in the Toujeo group and 3.1% of patients in the Lantus group. Treatment-emergent 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported by low percentages of patients in each treatment group, 7.3% for 
Toujeo and 4.8% for Lantus. Treatment-emergent hypersensitivity reactions by individual PT were reported 
in <2% of patients in either treatment group. None of the events was severe in intensity or serious in nature. 
None of the events were considered related to the IMP.

Immunogenicity assessments (insulin antibodies) 
At baseline, a similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups were positive for anti-insulin antibody 
(AIA) (Toujeo: 77.7% and Lantus: 79.8%). During the main 6-months TEAE period, the percentage of 
patients with a treatment-emergent AIA response (ie, treatment-boosted or treatment-induced AIAs) was 
similar in both treatment groups with a median peak titer of 4.0. 
The percentages of patients positive for AIA slightly increased during the main 6-months on-treatment 
period and were similar in both the treatment groups. As expected, the percentages of patients with 
antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin were similar in both treatment groups and ranged between 
76.2% and 84.1% during the study. 
Treatment-emergent AIAs had no impact on the insulin dose requirements or safety parameters (including 
hypoglycaemia, hypersensitivity and injection site reactions, TEAEs, and SAEs) in either treatment group. 
In addition, there was no relationship between the maximal AIA titers and insulin doses or safety 
parameters, regardless of treatment-emergent AIA status. Based on the independent blinded external 
endpoint assessment committee’s review of hypersensitivity events in patients with treatment-induced or 
treatment-boosted AIAs, 3 out of 4 patients with such events (Toujeo: 2 patients-PTs Bronchospasm and 
Prurigo; Lantus: 1 patient-PT Rash pustular) were classified as AIA-mediated hypersensitivity events. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
2.5.1.  Interaction effects 
During the 6-months TEAE period, the incidence and pattern of common TEAEs (HLTs with an incidence 
≥2%), SAEs, and clinical laboratory abnormalities across the prespecified subgroups of age (<12 and ≥12 
years) and gender were consistent with the results for the overall population. The majority of patients 
(approximately 90%) in each treatment group were White; this precludes any comparison of the incidence 
of TEAEs across racial subgroups. 
Drug-drug interactions were not evaluated in this study (EFC13957) and therefore, no new information is 
available. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
Two patients (0.9%) in each treatment group reported TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation (2 patients (0.9%) in each group). Events were somnolence, malaise, and ALT increase in 
the Toujeo group and injection site pain and ALT increase in the Lantus group.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study EFC13957 is the only clinical study in the paediatric population. Safety endpoints were 
hyperglycaemia with or without ketosis, adverse events (including injection site reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions), antibodies to insulin, routine laboratory, and Tanner puberty stage. 
The safety population was 233 children and adolescent patients with T1DM treated with Toujeo and 228 
treated with Lantus. Mean exposure was 180 days (26 weeks) for Toujeo and 179 days (26 weeks) for 
Lantus and most patients were treated for more than 25 weeks, 92.7% for Toujeo and 93.4% for Lantus. 
During the 6-months TEAE period, almost all patients had at least one event of ‘any’ hypoglycaemia at any 
time of the day (Toujeo: 97.9%; Lantus: 98.2%). The percentage of patients with at least one nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia event (in any category) was also similar in both treatment groups (Toujeo: 73.0%; Lantus: 
71.9%). Severe hypoglycaemia at any time of the day was reported by 14 patients (6.0%) in the Toujeo 
group and 20 patients (8.8%) in the Lantus group. Severe hypoglycaemia during the nocturnal period 
(00:00-05:59) was reported by 7 patients in each treatment group. None of the patients permanently 
discontinued treatment due to the severe hypoglycaemia event. 
During the main 6-months treatment period, no new or unexpected safety signals were observed. The 
overall proportion of subjects with an AE during the study period was similar across the two treatment 
groups (65.2% for Toujeo and 65.8% for Lantus). The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT in the Toujeo 
and Lantus groups, respectively were nasopharyngitis (12.9% and 13.6%), headache (7.3% and 5.7%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (6.9% and 5.7%), and ketosis (6.4% and 10.1%). In both treatment 
groups, the most frequently reported severe TEAEs by PT were hypoglycaemic unconsciousness (Toujeo: 
2.1%; Lantus: 3.1%) and hypoglycaemic seizure (Toujeo: 1.3%; Lantus: 3.1%).  
Adverse events considered related were low and comparable between the two treatment groups, 6.0% for 
Toujeo and 8.3% for Lantus. In general, the spectrum of related adverse advents for this 6 months of 
treatment was comparable between the Toujeo and the Lantus group and in line with section 4.8 of the 
SmPC for Toujeo for adults. 
No new signal was found with regards to adverse events of interest hypersensitivity reactions and injection 
site reactions, which were reported by low percentages of patients in each treatment group. Hypersensitivity 
reactions was reported slightly more for Toujeo: 7.3% (n=17) for Toujeo and 4.8% (n=11) for Lantus. The 
known related adverse event ‘lipohypertrophy’ (frequency ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Toujeo 
and Lantus) was not reported. 
Overall, the AE profile was in accordance with the SmPC for Lantus and Toujeo without any difference of 
clinical significance between the two treatment groups. 
At baseline, a similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups were positive for insulin antibodies 
(AIA) (Toujeo: 77.7% and Lantus: 79.8%). The percentages of patients positive for AIA slightly increased 
during the main 6-months on-treatment period and were similar in both treatment groups. The percentages 
of patients with antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin were similar in both treatment groups and 
ranged between 76.2% and 84.1% during the study. Assessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c and 
AIA development showed no evidence of the development of immunologically-mediated insulin resistance to 
Toujeo. 
The full safety data set including 52 weeks of treatment further support the safety in paediatric T1DM 
patients.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Toujeo and Lantus both contain insulin glargine but are administered in formulations, that are not 
bioequivalent. Although Lantus (100 IU) has since long been used in paediatric patients aged from 2 years, 
Toujeo (300 IU) has only been approved for adults. Within the study period of 26 weeks currently submitted, 
safety of the two preparations was evaluated and no new or unexpected safety signals were identified in 
Toujeo-treated patients compared to Lantus-treated patients, with regard to incidence and frequency of 
hypoglycaemia and other adverse events of special interest. The spectrum of TEAEs was comparable 
between the Toujeo group and de Lantus group. 
No difference in adverse pattern was noted between treatment groups over the first 26 weeks of the 
paediatric study, and this was supported by the full safety data set including 52 weeks. 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly (section 2).  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No additional user consultation is necessary for Insulin glargine (HOE901) for this variation. Since the 
indication is extended to paediatric population, the users remain identical and the information to guarantee 
the safe use of the product also remains identical. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycaemia from defects in insulin secretion, 
insulin action, or both.  
Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system incorrectly targets 
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas until no more insulin is produced. The majority of patients 
diagnosed are children and adolescents, with peaks in disease presentation at 5 to 9 years of age and around 
puberty. Globally, the incidence of T1DM continues to rise by 2% to 5% each year. The prevalence of T1DM 
varies considerably from country to country.  
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized by the body losing its ability to respond to insulin, i.e. insulin 
resistance. It is usually diagnosed in people over 30 years old and results from genetic, metabolic and 
socio-economical causes. Although the incidence of T2DM in the paediatric population is increasing, the 
absolute number of children and adolescents with T2DM is still relatively low, with an estimated prevalence 
in Europe of approximately 2.5:100000. However, a prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM as 
high as 6.7% was found in a large group of children and adolescents with obesity in Germany. The 
pathophysiology of paediatric T2DM appears to be similar to that in adults.  
Current treatment options for youth-onset T2DM are limited to two approved drugs: insulin and metformin. 
Despite hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance associated with T2DM, supplemental insulin (a larger 
amount compared to T1DM) is considered generally effective in reducing hyperglycaemia and attaining 
glycaemic target in paediatric T2DM just as in adult T2DM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/596054/2019

Both T1DM and T2DM are associated with acute and chronic complications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with T1DM require insulin replacement therapy, a basal-bolus insulin regimen which is designed to 
approximate physiologic basal and postprandial insulin release, thereby avoiding hyperglycaemia and 
hypoglycaemia. Typically a basal insulin analog is given to provide stable blood glucose lowering over the 
24-hour day, including during the overnight fast, and a rapid-acting insulin analogue is given with each meal 
to provide postprandial control.  
One of the most frequently used basal insulins is insulin glargine 100 U/mL (a.o. Lantus), a long-acting 
recombinant analogue of human insulin administered as a single-dose subcutaneous (SC) injection. In the 
EU, Lantus is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 
years and above. 
The product under review, insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Toujeo) contains 3-times the amount of insulin and 
corresponding zinc content. Except for the more concentrated formulation, there is a difference in PK/PD 
profile between Toujeo and Lantus where Toujeo shows slower and more prolonged absorption resulting in 
a flatter time-concentration profile compared to Lantus. 
Toujeo is currently approved for the treatment of diabetes in adults. With this application, the MAH seeks to 
extend the indication for Toujeo to include children and adolescents from the age of 6 years. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
T1DM 
As clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of Toujeo in the treatment of T1DM in the paediatric 
population, the applicant has submitted the 6-months randomized period of a single phase 3b non-inferiority 
Study EFC13957 of in total 52 weeks duration, in which Toujeo was compared to Lantus in children and 
adolescent patients (aged 6 years to 17 years). Based on dose-response analyses, a need for dose 
adaptation in the paediatric population was considered not necessary, and the dose regimen for Toujeo 
recommended for adults was also applied in this paediatric study. 
The study included 233 patients to Toujeo and 230 patients to Lantus. Randomization was stratified by age 
group (6-12 years (143 subjects) and ≥ 12-17 years (320 subjects) and by HbA1c at screening (<8.5% [183 
subjects], ≥8.5% [280 subjects]). The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between 
groups. A high proportion of subjects completed the trial (95%).

Although the incidence of T2DM in the paediatric population is increasing, the absolute number of children 
and adolescents with T2DM is still relatively low, making a clinical study not feasible. Therefore, in line with 
the recommendations of the EMA diabetes guideline (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 2), to support the extension 
of the indication to include children and adolescents with T2DM, a qualitative comparison was made of the 
T1DM paediatric trial discussed above (Study EFC13957) with the efficacy and safety data from three of the 
four Phase 3 studies in adult patients with T2DM which were included in the initial submission dossier of 
Toujeo: 
•  Study EFC12456 included T1DM adult patients on basal + Toujeo or mealtime insulin (N=549 (274 
with Toujeo and 275 with Lantus).  
Assessment report

Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Study EFC11628 included T2DM adult patients on basal +mealtime insulin (N=807 (404 with Toujeo 
and 403 with Lantus)).  
•  Study EFC12347 included Insulin-naïve T2DM adult patients (N=878 (439 with Toujeo and 439 with 
Lantus)).  
The efficacy endpoints assessed were HbA1c and FPG. The demographic and baseline characteristics (other 
than disease-related) were generally similar across the different subgroups of interest in the paediatric and 
insulin-naïve adult populations. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Paediatric patients with T1DM - Study EFC13957 
Primary endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline at Week 26. The 
primary objective was met, as non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was demonstrated for HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 26 (Toujeo: mean (SD) 8.65% (0.88); Lantus: mean (SD) 8.61% (0.87) . The 
least squares (LS) mean difference in HbA1c for Toujeo versus Lantus was 0.004% (95% CI [(-0.172 to 
0.179]) with the upper bound of the 95% CI lower than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.  
Mean HbA1c levels over time followed a similar pattern in both treatment groups. The treatment effect was 
consistent across most of the demographic and other pre-specified subgroups including Tanner puberty 
stages. In younger children below 12 years, a slightly more pronounced decrease in HbA1c was observed 
with both Toujeo and Lantus treatments.  
Secondary endpoints: At Week 26, a comparable efficacy of Toujeo to Lantus was seen for FPG, for 
percentage of patients who reached the pre-specified target HbA1c of <7.5% and pre-specified target FPG 
(≤130 mg/dL [7.2 mmol/L]) overall or without an event of severe and/or documented hypoglycaemia, 
change in 24-hour mean plasma glucose, and for 8-point SMPG profiles. 
Daily insulin dose: Mean daily insulin dose increased in both treatment groups, with the steepest increase 
between baseline and week 12. Consistent with the overall population, the increase was larger with Toujeo 
as compared to Lantus and across all Tanner puberty stages. After 12 weeks, doses remained relatively 
constant, and no significant changes were seen between the 20 and 26 weeks results. At Week 26 the dose 
was 8% higher in the Toujeo group (0.615 U/kg) than in the Lantus group (0.567 U/kg).  
Paediatric patients with T2DM - Extrapolation 
Treatment with Toujeo in individually titrated adult patients with T1DM and T2DM in studies EFC12456, 
EFC11628 and EFC12347 as well as in paediatric T1DM patients was effective in improving glycaemic control 
as demonstrated by lowering of mean HbA1c and mean FPG from baseline: Toujeo reduced mean change in 
HbA1c at endpoint (Month 6) compared to baseline in T1DM and T2DM patients (mean HbA1c ranged from 
8.11 to 8.65%). The changes in HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 were similar in adult and paediatric T1DM 
patients, but greater in insulin-naïve T2DM patients. The reduction pattern was similar in all studies: the 
reduction was greater in insulin-naïve T2DM patients and greatest in the first 12 weeks with a flattening of 
the curves thereafter. Consistent with HbA1c reduction, FPG decreased in all studies, with a greatest 
reduction observed in T2DM patients, and particularly in insulin-naïve patients.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Paediatric patients with T1DM - Study EFC13957 
Hypoglycaemia: During the 6-months TEAE period, almost all patients had at least one event of ‘any’ 
hypoglycaemia at any time of the day (Toujeo: 97.9%; Lantus: 98.2%). The percentage of patients with at 
least one nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (in any category) was also similar in both treatment groups 
(Toujeo: 73.0%; Lantus: 71.9%). Severe hypoglycaemia at any time of the day was reported by 14 patients 
(6.0%) in the Toujeo group and 20 patients (8.8%) in the Lantus group. Severe hypoglycaemia during the 
nocturnal period (00:00-05:59) was reported by 7 patients in each treatment group. None of the patients 
permanently discontinued treatment due to the severe hypoglycaemia event. 
Adverse events pattern: During the main 6-months treatment period, no new or unexpected safety 
signals were observed. The overall proportion of subjects with an AE during the study period was similar 
across the two treatment groups (65.2% for Toujeo and 65.8% for Lantus). The most frequently reported 
TEAEs by PT in the Toujeo and Lantus groups, respectively were nasopharyngitis (12.9% and 13.6%), 
headache (7.3% and 5.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.9% and 5.7%), and ketosis (6.4% and 
10.1%). In both treatment groups, the most frequently reported severe TEAEs by PT were hypoglycaemic 
unconsciousness (Toujeo: 2.1%; Lantus: 3.1%) and hypoglycaemic seizure (Toujeo: 1.3%; Lantus: 3.1%). 
Adverse events considered related were comparable between the two treatment groups, 6.0% for Toujeo 
and 8.3% for Lantus. 
No new signal was found with regards to specific adverse events of interest like hypersensitivity reactions, 
and injection site reactions, which were found in the same range in each treatment group. Hypersensitivity 
reactions was reported slightly more for Toujeo: 7.3% (n=17) for Toujeo and 4.8% (n=11) for Lantus. The 
known related adverse event ‘lipohypertrophy’ (frequency ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Toujeo 
and Lantus) was not reported. 
Overall the AE profile was in accordance with the SmPC for Lantus and Toujeo without any difference of 
clinical significance between the two treatment groups. 
Immunogenicity assessments (insulin antibodies): At baseline, a similar percentage of patients in 
both treatment groups were positive for AIA (Toujeo: 77.7% and Lantus: 79.8%). The percentages of 
patients positive for AIA increased during the main 6-months treatment in both treatment groups. The 
percentages of patients with antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin were remained similar in both 
treatment groups and ranged between 76.2% and 84.1% during the study.  
The main 6-months treatment period was followed by the 6-months safety extension period of the Phase 3b 
clinical study EFC13957 (EDITION JUNIOR).  
No new safety data or trends have become available from the 6-months safety extension period.  It can be 
concluded that the safety profile of Toujeo was similar to that of Lantus in children and adolescents aged 6 
- 17 years with T1DM. The overall incidence of TEAEs during the entire 12-months period was similar 
between the treatment groups. 
The 12-months safety part has been included in the safety part of the Effects Table 40 as a comparison:

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Subjects with T1DM and T2DM require life-long insulin treatment. In order to allow individualized treatment, 
with the aim of achieving good metabolic control, insulins with different PD profiles are needed. T1DM and 
especially T2DM are rare in children but insulin treatment is mandatory to prevent death, irrespective of age. 
With the current submission, data to support the use of Toujeo in children and adolescents aged 6 year and 
above have been submitted. No adapted device is available to apply Toujeo 300 units/ml in children younger 
than 6 years. 
Importance of favourable effects 
In the comparative study in paediatric patients with T1DM, non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was 
demonstrated for HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26. The secondary efficacy endpoints such as FPG 
between baseline and Week 26 are in support of the HbA1c results, with similar values and trends. 
The quantitative analysis (extrapolation) submitted in support of efficacy in paediatric patients with T2DM, 
shows that Toujeo was effective in adult T1DM, adult T2DM and children with T1DM. The reductions in HbA1c 
in T2DM are similar and follow a similar pattern of response.  
Importance of unfavourable effects 
Hypoglycaemia is a common safety concern in patients with T1DM and T2DM on intensive insulin therapy 
and is therefore important to consider when evaluating the safety profile Toujeo.  
In the 26 weeks treatment period of the paediatric T1DM study, the overall risk of hypoglycaemia and the 
risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia were similar in both treatment groups. The occurrence of severe 
hypoglycaemia and SAEs of hypoglycaemia were comparable (and even slightly lower) between Toujeo and 
Lantus.  
No relevant differences were found in other safety parameters between Toujeo and Lantus, such as 
hyperglycaemia with ketosis, hypersensitivity, and injection site reactions. 
In the extrapolation data, safety results collected form adult patients with T1DM, insulin-naïve T2DM, 
advanced T2DM and paediatric patients with T1DM were compared. The results of this analysis do not point 
towards a different risk for children with T2DM compared to T1DM. 
Since insulin glargine 100 units/ml and Toujeo 300 units/ml are not bioequivalent and are not 
interchangeable, switching may result in the need for a change in dose and should only be done under strict 
medical supervision. The educational materials (see key aspects in Annex II) agreed at time of the adult 
indication are also applicable for children. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
T1DM: 
Non-inferiority of Toujeo relative to Lantus was robustly demonstrated for the efficacy endpoint HbA1c 
change from baseline to Week 26. The secondary endpoint findings were in line with the primary endpoint 
finding. Comparable safety of Toujeo versus Lantus was demonstrated..  
T2DM: 
The presented extrapolation of results in adult patients with T2DM treated with Toujeo to support use in 
paediatric patients with T2DM is considered adequate and in line with the recommendations of such 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/596054/2019 
Page 79/82 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
 
approach described in the EMA guideline on clinical investigation in the treatment or prevention of diabetes. 
The reductions in HbA1c are similar in adult T1DM, T2DM and children with T1DM (26 weeks of study 
EFC13957) and appear to follow a similar pattern of response. Safety data do not point towards a different 
risk for children with T2DM. Therefore, these extrapolation data sufficiently support that Toujeo will also be 
effective and safe in children with T2DM.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Toujeo is positive in treatment of diabetes mellitus in adolescents and 
children from the age of 6 years.

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Toujeo 300 units/ml in each member state the marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) must agree the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects, with the National Competent Authority. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each member state where Toujeo 300 units/ml is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) who are expected to prescribe or dispense Toujeo 300 units/ml, 
as well as all patients or their carers who are expected to use Toujeo 300 units/ml, are provided 
with educational material to address the risk(s) of Medication error (switching between 100 units/ml and 300 
units/ml without dose adjustment). 
The educational materials consist of: 
•  Guide for healthcare professionals 
• 
Patient/carer guide (patient brochure) 
The educational materials for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Details on how to minimize the safety concern addressed by the additional risk minimization 
measures through appropriate monitoring and management: 
  That insulin glargine 100 units/ml and insulin glargine 300 units/ml (Toujeo SoloStar and Toujeo 
DoubleStar) are not bioequivalent and are therefore not interchangeable without dose 
adjustment. 
  That dose adjustment is needed when patients are switched from one to the other strength: 
o  After titration, on average a 10-18% higher basal insulin dose are needed to achieve 
target ranges for plasma glucose levels when using the 300 units/ml formulation 
compared to the 100 units/ml formulation; 
o  Switching from the 300 units/ml to the 100 units/ml concentration results in an 
increased risk of hypoglycaemic events, mainly in the first week after the switch. To 
reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin regimen 
from an insulin regimen with once daily Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) to a once 
daily regimen with insulin glargine 100 units/ml should reduce their dose by 20%; 
o  When switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin 
product to a regimen with Toujeo, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be 
required and the concomitant anti-hyperglycaemic treatment may need to be adjusted. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the switch and in the initial weeks 
thereafter. 
•  Key messages to convey in patients counselling: 
  Patients need to be instructed that insulin glargine 100 units/ml products and Toujeo are not 
interchangeable and dose adjustments need to be made; 
  Blood glucose monitoring by patients is needed during the switch and the initial weeks 
thereafter. 
• 
Instructions on how to report medication errors or adverse events: Details for national reporting

  That insulin glargine 100 units/ml and insulin glargine 300 units/ml (Toujeo SoloStar and Toujeo 
DoubleStar) are not bioequivalent and are therefore not interchangeable without dose 
adjustment; 
  That the switch from one insulin therapy to another should only be done when prescribed by 
their healthcare provider; 
  That the dose newly recommended by their healthcare provider should always be followed; 
  That blood glucose need to be closely monitored during the switch and the initial weeks 
thereafter; 
  That they should consult their healthcare provider for further information; 
  That they should report medication errors or any side effects. Details for national reporting 
added at country level; 
  That insulin glargine 300 units/ml is available in two different presentations: Toujeo SoloStar 
(1.5 mL prefilled pen/450 units) and Toujeo DoubleStar (3 mL prefilled pen/900 units). The dose 
increment in Toujeo SoloStar is one unit and the dose increment in Toujeo DoubleStar is 2 units. 
The dose delivered is the one shown in the dose window. 
The target audience and the modalities for distribution of all of these materials are to be agreed at Member 
State Level. The MAH shall agree the final text and the context of the educational material for HCPs and 
patients together with a communication plan, with the National Competent Authority in each member state 
prior to launch of the medicinal product. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP, by consensus, is of the opinion that Toujeo is not similar to Amglidia within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See Appendix 1. 
4.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Toujeo is positive in treatment of diabetes mellitus in adolescents and 
children from the age of 6 years.

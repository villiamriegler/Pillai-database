1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Sandoz GmbH submitted on 11 November 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Erelzi, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) 
and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Erelzi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless 
contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Erelzi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Erelzi is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not 
previously treated with methotrexate. 
Etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of 
joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and 
adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, 
methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response 
to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Etanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint 
damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 6/81 
 
  
 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as 
indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have 
had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen 
and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are 
inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for marketing authorisation of Erelzi, a biosimilar product to 
the European reference product Enbrel (EMA product number EMEA/H/C/000262). Enbrel is approved for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and 
(juvenile) plaque psoriasis. Enbrel was first authorised in the European Union in 2000.

About the product 
Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque 
psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The 
mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, 
preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also 
modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion 
molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is a MAA for Erelzi, a proposed biosimilar, submitted under Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Erelzi is claimed to be a biosimilar product to the reference product Enbrel. In Europe Enbrel was approved via 
the centralised procedure on 03 February 2000 and is authorised for Pfizer Limited, UK. 
Scientific advice 
Non-clinical 
In 2010 CHMP provided scientific advice on the non-clinical package. At that time the CHMP suggested some 
alternative approaches for the non-clinical in vivo studies proposed by the applicant. The Applicant performed 
and submitted a study in cynomolgus monkeys, justifying their choice with view on a global development and 
because etanercept was expected to have a lower immunogenic potential in this species (based on information 
in the Enbrel EPAR) compared to rodent models. 
PK/PD 
A cross-over design was considered feasible for the equivalence studies, as the half-life of etanercept is shorter 
than that of other TNFα antibodies. The lower drug clearance in patients with RA compared to healthy volunteers 
(0.066 vs. 0.11 l/h) may reflect differences in target binding. For this reason, it was advised to collect 
comparative PK and PD data for clearance-related parameters during a Phase III trial. This was followed by the 
Applicant in the psoriasis study. 
The CHMP indicated that the general development approach of demonstrating pharmacokinetic equivalence in a 
single Phase I trial and therapeutic equivalence in a single Phase III trial seems acceptable, as long this would 
be adequately supported by quality and non-clinical data, and an EU-sourced Enbrel product was used as 
reference product. The CHMP recommendation to use EU Enbrel as a Reference product in the studies was 
adapted.  
SAWP/CHMP advices, Clinical 
The CHMP preferred rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to psoriasis as a model demonstrating equivalence, since patients 
with psoriasis may concern a more heterogeneous population, as a variety of prior treatments can be applied 
before the use of etanercept. Psoriasis may also be associated with a high inter-individual variability due to a 
more variable ‘load’ of target antigen than in RA, as there is more surface area in the skin than in the joints 
(Gottlieb 2007). The Applicant discussed the design of an equivalence study in RA in the follow-up advice of the 
SAWP/CHMP in 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/424696/2011). The final development plan, however, did not include a 
study in RA but in moderate-severe psoriasis instead. However, The CHMP’ recommendation to continue 
monitoring of safety and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in a follow-up phase up to 12 months, was followed by the 
Applicant.

EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 10/81 
 
  
 
In several national scientific advices it was suggested to use the continuous PASI scale as the primary endpoint, 
as such an endpoint may be more sensitive to detect differences in efficacy than a dichotomous outcome of 
PASI75. In response, the Applicant included percentage change from baseline in the absolute PASI scores as key 
secondary endpoint. Furthermore, the proposed equivalence margin of the primary endpoint PASI75 of +/-18% 
was considered too broad by several agencies. The equivalence margin of the key secondary endpoint based on 
percentage change from baseline in PASI score was set to +/- 15%.  
Furthermore, the Applicant sought scientific advice regarding cross-over of the study medications after 12 
weeks in the follow-up study phase after 12 weeks, as supportive evidence for establishing exchangeability. This 
concept was disputed in some national scientific advices. 
A GCP-inspection has been performed by the German Inspectorate for Study GP15-302 (EudraCT number: 
2012-002011-26), on request of the EMA. Several critical findings were noted. The inspection was followed by 
a re-monitoring procedure by independent auditors, as aligned with the inspectorate. Based on Inspectors’ 
recommendations and outcomes of the re-monitoring, no major critical issues regarding GCP compliance of the 
pivotal clinical trial of this application are remaining. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Erelzi (etanercept) has been developed as a similar medicinal product according to Article 10(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product used throughout the development program is Enbrel, sourced 
from the European Union. The same therapeutic indications are proposed for Erelzi as granted for Enbrel in the 
EU.  
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) containing the active 
substance etanercept at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The excipients are sodium citrate as buffer, sodium 
chloride as tonicity agent, sucrose and L-lysine as stabilizers and water for injection as diluent. 
Two strengths of Erelzi finished product, 25 mg/0.5 mL and 50 mg/1.0 mL, have been developed based on the 
available presentations of the reference product Enbrel. Both strengths are solutions for injection in a pre-filled 
syringe (PFS) assembled with a Needle Safety Device (NSD). The 50 mg PFS is also available assembled in an 
Autoinjector (AI). The paediatric 10 mg strength approved for the reference medicinal product is not included in 
the marketing authorisation application for Erelzi. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General Information 
Etanercept is a recombinant dimeric fusion protein consisting of two extracellular domains of the 75-kilodalton 
tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc (fragment, crystallisable) portion of an immunoglobulin 
G1 (IgG1) antibody (TNFR:Fc). Etanercept exerts its biological effect through binding and neutralisation of 
TNFα.  
Erelzi is produced using the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expression system, contains 934 amino acids 
(homo-dimer: 467) and has an approximate molecular mass of 125 kDa as determined by mass spectroscopy. 
The apparent molecular size (determined by SDS-PAGE) is 150 kDa. Erelzi is glycosylated and contains 6 
N-glycans and multiple O-glycans. These variants are sialylated as well. In addition, 29 disulfide bridges are 
present throughout the molecule.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of the active substance takes place at Sandoz GmbH Schaftenau, Langkampfen, Austria. 
Appropriate GMP certificates have been provided. 
A production batch is generated from a working cell bank (WCB) vial, upon cell expansion and protein production 
during the upstream process (fermentation) and the subsequent downstream process (purification). 
Fermentation comprises the consecutive operations inoculum preparation, pre-stage cultivation, and 
main-stage cultivation. The purification includes primary separation followed by a combination of 
chromatography and filtration steps leading to the final active substance.  
Control of materials 
Erelzi is expressed from a CHO cell line. A classical two tiered cell bank system is established. The origin of the 
cell substrate, relevant information on the vector map, as well as the complete nucleotide sequence of the 
expression vector has been presented in the dossier. The cell banking system is conventional and established 
according to ICH Q5D. Specifications for the cell banks have been adequately presented.  
Raw materials used for the Erelzi active substance manufacturing process are controlled by specifications that 
assure their identity, strength and purity. They are obtained from established suppliers together with a 
certificate of analysis. These materials either comply with pharmacopoeial monographs (USP, Ph. Eur.) or 
internal test procedures.

Based on risk assessment and results from process characterisation studies, the PPs have been divided into 
critical-PPs (CPP), key-PPs (KPP) and non-key PPs (NKPP). For each PP, an acceptable range was defined 
through process characterisation and/or validation studies.  
As for the PPs, also the IPCs are divided into critical, key and non-key process controls. CIPCs are defined by 
acceptance criteria or by action limits. If an acceptance criterion is not met, the batch will be rejected, while for 
action limits, an investigation will be conducted. The decision to release the batch is taken based on the results 
of the investigation. Key in-process controls (KIPCs) have associated action limits, while NKIPCS either have 
alert limits or no associated limits.  
The Applicant submitted brief justifications for all critical steps/parameters/tests; and upon request, additional 
justification was provided. These cumulative justifications are based on extensive process characterisation 
studies and are considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
To ensure consistent product quality and to demonstrate robust process performance the manufacturing 
process at the intended commercial manufacturing scale was validated in accordance with GMP with a variety of 
experimental setups and targets. In addition, large scale validation was supported by small scale studies.  
The validation batches have been manufactured within the defined ranges for process parameters and the 
output data presented demonstrate high batch to batch consistency both for the upstream cell culture process 
and for the downstream purification process. All acceptance criteria for the selected process controls provided 
were fulfilled. Furthermore, the active substance batch release data are comparable between batches and 
comply with the acceptance criteria.  
Furthermore, the Applicant submitted data for impurity removal at full scale; hold time validation; limit of in 
vitro cell age; and column resin lifetime studies.  
Manufacturing process development 
As a key tool for developing the manufacturing process, for establishing the overall control strategy, as well as 
for justifying the characterisation and comparability program, the Applicant has performed criticality 
assessment of quality attributes based on a risk ranking approach. This criticality assessment is considered 
acceptable.  
During development of Erelzi, the active substance has been manufactured using two main manufacturing 
processes; Phase I and Phase III processes. In addition, smaller changes have occurred within the main 
processes.  
The Applicant has conducted extensive comparability exercises. Overall it is concluded, that comparability 
between batches produced throughout product development is demonstrated.  
Characterisation 
The Applicant has provided characterisation data on primary and higher order structures, molecular mass, 
charge, and heterogeneity with regard to glycosylation, AA-sequence, size and amino acid modifications. 
Furthermore, results from binding assays (TNF-α and Fc receptor) and in vitro bioassays (ADCC, CDC, inhibition 
of apoptosis, TNF-α and TNF-β neutralisation assays) have been presented.  
For the characterisation of impurities, the Applicant has considered both process- and product-related 
impurities. Efficient removal of all process-related impurities has been demonstrated.

As part of the characterisation of potential product-related impurities, the Applicant has studied oxidation, 
deamidation, basic variants (by CEX and CZE), aggregation and degradation products (by SEC-UV, AUC, 
SEC-MALLS, non-reducing CE-SDS), N-glycans and sialic acids, glycation, and wrongly bridged disulphides.  
Upon request, additional data and clarification was submitted regarding wrongly bridged disulphide variants 
(including the so called T7 peptide variant), which are major impurities. Submitted data suggest that these 
misfolded variants may refold to the active variant correctly. In addition, the applicant committed to submit a 
variation to implement an appropriate analytical method for the assessment of hydrophobic variants in the 
release and shelf-life specifications for active substance and finished product once optimized/developed and 
validated (see “Recommendation for future quality development).  
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The proposed DS release and shelf life specifications include control for pharmaceutical characteristics (colour of 
solution, pH and clarity), identity, purity, content, and potency. Overall, the test items included in the 
specifications are considered adequate and in line with relevant guidance. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures, including the used controls, system suitability, and sample acceptance criteria, have 
been described. Compendial methods are sufficiently defined by their respective monograph. Furthermore, the 
Applicant has provided validation reports on non-compendial methods (e.g. bioactivity assay). In general, the 
validation reports are thorough and cover the relevant aspects.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results were within the specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The Applicant has provided a description of reference standards used throughout the development of Erelzi. For 
commercial manufacturing, working standards are used for routine analytical testing, while the in-house 
primary reference is only used for release and re-testing of working standards. 
The reference standard is satisfactorily established and an appropriate protocol has been laid down to replace 
the reference standard or to qualify working standards as needed.  
Stability 
The proposed shelf life is 36 months at ≤ -60°C 
The Applicant has provided long-term stability data from multiple commercial scale batches.  
In addition, the Applicant performed studies at accelerated and stressed conditions.  
Taken together, the proposed shelf life and associated conditions are acceptable.

Erelzi 25 mg/0.5 mL and 50 mg/1.0 mL solution for injection is a colourless to slightly yellowish solution 
comprising etanercept as active substance, sodium citrate as buffer, sodium chloride as tonicity agent, sucrose 
and L-lysine as stabilizers and water for injections as diluent. The pH is adjusted to 6.3 with sodium hydroxide 
and hydrochloric acid as required. 
The finished product is supplied in pre-filled syringes (PFS) (clear glass barrel with fixed needle) closed with a 
plunger stopper and is intended for subcutaneous administration. The bulk PFS is combined with either an 
Autoinjector (AI) or a CE-marked Needle Safety Device with an add-on finger flange (NSD). Neither the NSD nor 
the AI is in direct contact with the finished product. The information provided for the container closure system 
is satisfactory. 
During the development of Erelzi combined quality attribute ranges of US-licensed Enbrel and EU-authorized 
Enbrel were employed as Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP). Citrate buffer, Sucrose, NaCl and L-lysine was 
chosen as the most suitable Erelzi formulation, as it provided stability and PK parameters which were closer to 
the reference product than other investigated formulations. Compared to the reference product, phosphate and 
L-arginine were exchanged for citrate and L-lysine. The formulation process development has been presented in 
detail and is considered acceptable. 
The manufacturing process development has been clearly described; the main differences between process A 
and process B (varied batch sizes) have been identified and analytical comparability between finished product 
produced with process A and process B has been demonstrated.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing formula was adequately provided. The batch size is calculated based on the quantity and protein 
content of etanercept in Erelzi DS solution.  
A clear description of the Erelzi finished product manufacturing process has been provided including IPCs and 
maximum hold/standing times applied. Erelzi finished product is produced using standard manufacturing steps 
such as thawing of the active substance, dissolving of excipients, compounding, sterile filtration and aseptic 
filling into syringes. The evaluation and justification of PPs and IPCs has been presented. Process parameters 
and IPCs are specified and limits have been provided, where applicable. The description of the manufacturing 
process is appropriate.  
Process Validation 
Validation of Erelzi 25mg/0.5ml and 50mg/1.0ml solution for injection in pre-filled syringe was performed. 
Consecutive validation batches of bulk finished product solution were produced. In addition, appropriate hold 
time validation and media fills were performed. All analytical data complied well with requirements.  
Product specification 
The specifications include general tests (e.g. color, pH, clarity, extractable volume, appearance of container, 
osmolality), tests for identity, purity, content and potency.  
The specification for the 25 mg and 50 mg presentations are analogous and differ only in parameters related to 
reduced content/fill volume, but not concentration.  
Analytical methods 
The Applicant has described the analytical procedures, including the used controls, system suitability and 
sample acceptance criteria. Most of the finished product release methods are identical to the active substance 
methods.

Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data from several finished product batches were provided. The results were within the 
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Stability of the product 
The claimed shelf life is 30 months, when stored at 5 ± 3°C, followed by 28 days at 25 ± 2°C. This applies for 
both strengths and for both the AI and PFS with NSD.  
A summary of the data provided to support the proposed shelf life is outlined in Table 1 below.

Condition A is the intended condition to claim shelf-life. To this end samples were stored for several days at 
25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH, shaken and stored at 5 ± 3°C thereafter. The samples were additionally stored at 
25 ± 2°C/60% ± 5% RH for a period of 28 days prior to every sampling point. 
Batches were tested at appropriate time points in line with ICH Q5C. The tests are those described in the shelf 
life specification. It is noted and accepted that not all tests were performed at all time points.  
The results of the photostability studies demonstrate that Erelzi finished product is light sensitive and should be 
protected from light. A statement is included in the SmPC that the product should be kept in the outer carton in 
order to protect from light. 
The claimed shelf life of 30 months, when stored at 5 ± 3°C, followed by 28 days at 25 ± 2°C is sufficiently 
justified by the data provided and consequently acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Biosimilarity 
In order to compare the physicochemical and biological characteristics of Erelzi and Enbrel, the Applicant has 
conducted a comprehensive comparability exercise. The study follows the general recommendations given in 
the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active 
substance; Quality issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012). 
For the head-to-head comparison, the Applicant has compared several batches of Erelzi and EU Enbrel as well as 
US-sourced Enbrel batches. Although the comparative studies demonstrate high similarity between EU- and 
US-sourced Enbrel batches, only the EU Enbrel batches are considered pivotal for the head-to-head analyses. 
In order to establish comparability ranges, the Applicant has considered historical characterisation data 
collected from Enbrel batches. Based mainly on a quality attribute criticality assessment the quality attributes of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 16/81 
 
  
 
 
 
 
etanercept have been classified into different tiers. The risk assessment and tier classification was described in 
detail and was found acceptable.  
The comparative characterisation studies include assessment of primary structure, higher order structure, 
molecular mass/size, charge, content, heterogeneity in glycosylation pattern (O-glycosylation N-glycosylation, 
glycation, sialic acids), heterogeneity in amino acid sequence (variability of the N- and C-terminus), size 
heterogeneity, heterogeneity with regard to amino acid modifications (deamidation and oxidation), charge 
heterogeneity, hydrophobicity, compendial methods, process related impurities, binding assays and in vitro 
bioassays. Orthogonal methods have been used, where possible. All methods have been fully developed and 
implemented.  
For most quality attributes and characteristics, high similarity between Erelzi and EU Enbrel has been 
established. Primary and higher order structures do not display any significant differences. With regard to the 
variability of the N- and C-terminus, minor differences were observed, but these differences were shown to have 
no impact on safety or efficacy. Overall, protein deamidation and oxidation levels appear to be highly similar. In 
the head-to-head comparison, lower levels of aggregates and degradation product were seen for Erelzi 
compared to EU Enbrel, with corresponding higher SEC main peak purity. Similar results were also obtained 
using orthogonal analytical methods. From a clinical point of view, the lower level of aggregates and degradation 
products are, however, of no concern. In reverse phase chromatography, lower amounts of post-peak variants 
were detected in Erelzi. Upon request, further data and justification was submitted regarding these variants (see 
also characterisation section); this difference is acceptable from a biosimilarity point of view.  
The level of free cysteines was slightly lower for Erelzi than for EU-authorized Enbrel. Low amounts of free 
SH-groups are preferable, as they indicate open disulfide bridges and hence a possible change in the higher 
order structure of the overall molecule. This difference is therefore acceptable. 
For comparison of protein content the comparability criteria were fulfilled. 
The charge variant profile of disialylated Erelzi and EU Enbrel has been compared using capillary zone 
electrophoresis (CZE) and capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF). By CZE, slightly higher amounts of acidic variants 
and clearly lower amounts of basic variants have been observed in Erelzi compared to EU Enbrel. Upon request, 
the Applicant sufficiently demonstrated that these differences are due to clinically irrelevant variants.  
In reverse phase chromatography of disialylated samples, lower amounts of post-peak variants were detected 
in Erelzi compared to EU Enbrel. Based on characterisation studies the post peak fraction mainly consists of 
inactive wrongly bridged disulfide variants as well as of size variants with low activity. As the TNF-α bioactivity 
are similar between Erelzi and EU Enbrel, the difference in post peak variants as detected by reverse phase 
chromatography can be considered to be clinically irrelevant. 
Some degree of differences between Erelzi and Enbrel can be observed in 2D-DIGE electrophoresis. These 
differences are mostly seen for minor variants and are considered acceptable. The more abundant variants 
display high similarity.  
In the comparison of the glycan profiles, the Applicant has considered both O-glycans and N-glycans. The 
qualitative comparison of O-glycans did not reveal any differences. For N-glycans, both quantitative and 
qualitative differences were seen. Considering that these differences have been present throughout the product 
development, it is unlikely that the differences would have a clinical impact. Quantitative differences in 
N-glycans were observed in the head-to-head analyses for non-fucosylated and alpha-galactosylated N-glycans, 
as well as for high mannose structures. In the case of non-fucosylated N-glycans, the Erelzi active substance 
batches were also outside the tolerance interval of the EU Enbrel range. A resulting lower mean ADCC activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 17/81 
 
  
 
was observed for Erelzi compared to Enbrel. In order to exclude a relevant contribution of ADCC, the Applicant 
submitted appropriate data to justify the claim that neither Erelzi nor Enbrel were able to induce ADCC activity 
under more physiological conditions. CDC is also not expected to be involved in the mode of action for 
etanercept. Therefore, the small difference detected between Enbrel and Erelzi is considered clinically irrelevant. 
High mannose species are present at lower levels in Erelzi compared to EU Enbrel. A thorough discussion on the 
possible clinical impact of the difference was provided by the Applicant, sufficiently justifying that this difference 
is not relevant. 
In order to compare the mode of action characteristics of Erelzi and Enbrel, the Applicant has used two reporter 
gene assays for the neutralization of TNF-α and TNF-β, a cell-based TNF-α neutralization assay to characterise 
the inhibition of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis by etanercept, and measured TNF-α binding by surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR). Although a slight difference between Erelzi and Enbrel could be seen in the head-to-head 
analyses using the two reporter gene assays, the historical data summarised suggest similarity between Erelzi 
and Enbrel.  
In the binding studies to C1q and Fc receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa (F158 and V158), FcγRIIIb 
and FcRn), no differences were observed. 
In addition to the analytical methods used in the extended comparative characterisation, the Applicant has also 
applied compendial methods for comparing characteristics of Erelzi and EU Enbrel. No significant differences 
were observed with regard to the colour of the solution, clarity, pH, extractable volume, osmolality, as well as for 
the amount of visible and subvisible particles present. Investigations into process-related impurities (DNA, 
Protein A, HCPs) did not reveal relevant differences between Erelzi and EU Enbrel. 
Finally, comparative stability studies conducted under long-term storage conditions as well as under accelerated 
and stressed conditions provided evidence of similar degradation profiles of Erelzi and EU Enbrel. 
The outcome of the physicochemical and biological comparability exercise between Erelzi and Enbrel is 
summarised in the tables below.

1) Identity of the primary sequence was confirmed between Erelzi and US-licensed Enbrel only. This is considered justified since the primary 
sequence is unique for etanercept and was shown to be identical to the primary sequence presented in literature (Osslund T. D. et al 2007).  
2) The comparison of amino acid ratios was performed between Erelzi and US-licensed Enbrel only. This is considered justified since the amino 
acid ratio is dependent on the primary sequence of the product which was shown to be identical to the primary sequence of etanercept (see 
above). 
3) H/D exchange and 1D-NMR was performed for Erelzi and US-licensed Enbrel only which is considered justified since the higher order structure 
strongly depends on the primary structure which was shown to be identical the primary sequence of etanercept (see above). Furthermore, 
comparable higher order structure between Erelzi and EU-authorized Enbrel was shown by other analytical techniques like CD spectroscopy, 
FT-IR, DSC and X-ray crystallography.

In conclusion, an extensive analytical comparability exercise has been conducted and demonstrates that Erelzi 
is highly similar to the reference product Enbrel. 
2.2.5.  Adventitious agents 
Erelzi is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Multiple control elements are applied to ensure 
non-viral and viral safety of Erelzi active substance and finished product: 
•  Careful selection and control of the source and quality of the raw materials used in production  
•  Absence of primary human and animal-derived raw materials in the cell banks and in the manufacturing 
process  
•  Use of the well-characterized CHO parental cell line 
•  Characterization and testing for microbial contaminants, endogenous retrovirus-like particles known to be 
produced by the parental cell line and adventitious agents of the master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank 
(WCB) and extended cell bank (ECB)  
• 
• 
Testing for microbial contaminants, parental cell line-derived retrovirus-like particles and adventitious 
agents in bulk harvests (BH)  
The purification process for Erelzi comprises well-proven standard steps effective for virus removal, 
including chromatography steps as well as dedicated virus inactivation and virus removal steps 
•  Virus validation studies were conducted for various steps of the purification process to demonstrate 
inactivation/removal of xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and several other model viruses according 
to ICH Q5A  
• 
For release of active substance as well  as finished product, testing for endotoxin and microbial 
purity/sterility is mandatory

Virus validation studies 
The data sufficiently demonstrate that virus removal/inactivation is robust due to the presence of multiple 
orthogonal steps.

2.2.7.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant is recommended to implement an appropriate analytical method for the assessment of 
hydrophobic variants in the release and shelf-life specifications for active substance and finished product once 
optimized/developed and validated (See “Recommendation for future quality development”).  
The extensive analytical comparability exercise conducted between Erelzi and the reference product Enbrel 
sufficiently demonstrates high similarity.   
2.2.8.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. Biosimilarity to the reference product Enbrel has been satisfactorily demonstrated at the 
quality level. 
2.2.9.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant should submit a variation to implement an appropriate analytical method for the assessment of 
hydrophobic variants in the release and shelf-life specifications for active substance and finished product once 
optimized/developed and validated.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant performed and submitted a study in cynomolgus monkeys, justifying their choice with view on a 
global development and because etanercept was expected to have a lower immunogenic potential in this species 
compared to rodent models (based on information in the Enbrel EPAR). The study was conducted in accordance 
with GLP.

•  Similar biologic medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies: non-clinical and clinical issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Etanercept, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Erelzi and Enbrel, is a recombinant dimeric fusion 
protein consisting of two extracellular domains of the 75-kilodalton tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked 
to the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) portion of an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody (TNFR:Fc). Erelzi is 
produced using the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expression system. 
Etanercept binds to and neutralizes the biological activity of TNFα and lymphotoxin alpha (LTα). By competitively 
inhibiting the binding of TNFα to cell surface receptors etanercept prevents the TNFα mediated signal 
transduction which requires the cross-linking of cell surface receptors. 
In vitro assays comparing Enbrel/EU, Enbrel/US and Erelzi were conducted to investigate 
•  Binding and functional neutralization of TNFα and LTα in a reporter gene assay. The cell based TNFα 
neutralization assay covers the main function of Erelzi/Enbrel, i.e. the binding and neutralization of 
TNFα. 
•  Binding to TNFα using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 
•  Binding to human Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)) using surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR). 
•  Binding to C1q using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
• 
• 
TNFα neutralization in a cell based assay using the ability of etanercept to inhibit TNFα-mediated 
apoptosis. 
The ability of etanercept to initiate ADCC- and CDC-mediated depletion of transmembrane 
TNFα-expressing target cells using suitable cell-based assays. 
•  Binding to tmTNFα on stably tmTNF-transfected human cell lines. 
•  Caspase induction in tmTNF-transfected cell lines. 
The in vitro bioassays and target and receptor binding assays performed to control and characterize Erelzi 
showed that Erelzi has the same in vitro target binding specificity to TNFα, LTα3 and LTα2β1 as Enbrel/EU and 
Enbrel/US, as well as similar functional neutralization of TNFα as Enbrel/EU and Enbrel/US in a reporter gene 
assay. The binding affinities to all tested Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and FcRn) were similar between 
Erelzi, Enbrel/EU and Enbrel/US, the binding to human C1q was similar as was the ability to inhibit 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017

TNFα-mediated apoptosis. Binding to tmTNF for EU or US Enbrel and Erelzi was slightly different, while this did 
not lead to caspase induction (as measure for apoptosis) in a cell-based assay. In contrast, binding of Remicade 
to tmTNF did lead to caspase induction, indicating suitability of this assay. 
In contrast to Remicade, both EU or US Enbrel and Erelzi did not suppress cytokine release subsequent to 
binding of etanercept to tmTNF. 
A twofold reduced ADCC and an increased CDC activity for Erelzi compared to Enbrel was shown.  
Further nonclinical comparison of the PD effects of Erelzi and the reference medicinal product Enbrel/EU was 
performed in vivo upon single and repeated dosing in the human TNFα transgenic mouse model of polyarthritis 
(Tg197 strain). Erelzi and Enbrel/EU were compared at the intermediate and hence more sensitive dose level of 
10 mg/kg after single and repeated (twice weekly for 2 or 4 weeks) i.p. administration to Tg197 mice. Additional 
vehicle buffer control (Erelzi formulation buffer) and positive control (Enbrel/EU at 30 mg/kg) groups were 
dosed twice weekly for 4 weeks. The primary endpoints for the PD response evaluation were the in life Tg197 
arthritic pathology (morphological and functional changes on both ankle joints) and the histopathology of the 
underlying lesions in the synovium and the arthritic joints. 
The results of study BMC248 (GP15-007) showed that Erelzi and Enbrel/EU were indistinguishable and both 
were statistically significantly better than the vehicle in inhibiting the in life Tg197 arthritic pathology and the 
underlying histopathology compared to the age-related aggravation of Tg197 pathology found in the vehicle 
buffer control group, the effects being most pronounced following twice weekly treatment for 4 weeks. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  secondary  PD  studies  are  required  for  a  biosimilar  product  developed  in  accordance  with  current  EMA 
guidance Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active Substance: 
Non-clinical and Clinical Issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies are required for a biosimilar product. However, safety pharmacology 
parameters covering the cardiovascular system such as recording of electrocardiograms and blood pressure 
measurements were assessed in the repeat-dose monkey toxicity study (study 8240755 (GP15-003). Neither 
Erelzi nor Enbrel/EU showed any adverse effects in these safety pharmacology parameters. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No PD drug interaction studies are required for a biosimilar product developed in accordance with current EMA 
guidance Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active Substance:

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The concentration of etanercept (either administered as Erelzi or Enbrel/EU) in serum from rabbits and monkeys 
was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay was validated for the detection of 
etanercept in rabbit and monkey serum. The concentration of anti-etanercept antibodies in serum from 
monkeys was determined using an electrochemiluminescence bridging immunogenicity assay. The assay was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 25/81 
 
  
 
set up in a two-step approach, i.e. a screening assay was followed by a confirmatory assay in case of a positive 
result in the screening assay.  
In a pilot single dose subcutaneous pharmacokinetic study in rabbits the formulation containing citrate and 
lysine (designated as citrate/lysine containing formulation) instead of phosphate and arginine as used in the 
originator formulation showed pharmacokinetic values closest to those obtained with the Enbrel or Erelzi in 
Enbrel formulation.  
The definitive subcutaneous pharmacokinetic comparability study in rabbits showed somewhat lower absolute 
total exposures (AUC values) of Erelzi compared to Enbrel/EU. The 90% Cl for the dose-adjusted 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-168h and AUC0-inf fell entirely within the comparability margins 
80-125%. Comparable bioavailability of Erelzi in the citrate/lysine containing formulation with Enbrel has been 
demonstrated in rabbits when administered subcutaneously at a nominal dose of 8 mg/kg. 
Pharmacokinetics after repeated administration is described as toxicokinetic data in the next section. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were performed. Based on the results of the first dose in the repeated 
dose toxicity study 8240755 (GP15-003), no deaths or change in general conditions were noted within one day 
after subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of Erelzi and Enbrel/EU to cynomolgus monkeys at a dose level of 15 
mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Nonclinical toxicology data are available from one repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey. Two 
groups of 3 animals/sex received Erelzi or Enbrel/EU at the dose level of 15 mg/kg/dose once every 3 days for 
4 weeks (total of 10 treatments). 
For both Erelzi and Enbrel/EU, no unscheduled mortality occurred during the study. There were no 
treatment-related effects on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, 
urinalysis and organ weights. The major findings in this study were local skin reactions at the injection sites 
characterized by rash, erythemas as well as inflammatory lesions for one and two males treated with Erelzi and 
Enbrel/EU, respectively.  
Changes in clinical pathology in the Erelzi and Enbrel/EU-treated groups were generally mild and did not differ 
significantly from control groups. However, individual animals showed some notable changes. Red and white 
blood cell parameter changes were seen in the Erelzi-treated animal 5M and the Enbrel/EU-treated animals 7M 
and 8M. Prominent etanercept-induced rash and associated changes in red blood cell and other haematological 
parameters including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia correlate with findings of ADAs and reduced 
etanercept levels. 
In the monkey study, serum etanercept levels initially moderately accumulate during the first week, but 
subsequently decrease, most likely due to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). A similar pattern was 
observed for both products.

In the comparative 4-week subcutaneous repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (8240755 
(GP15-003) immunogenicity was evaluated. In some monkeys of each administered group the development of 
anti-etanercept antibodies on Day 32 could be confirmed. 
The toxicokinetic (TK) parameters for Erelzi following subcutaneous administration at 15 mg/kg on Days 1, 7 
and 28 are presented below.

Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were performed with Erelzi. However, local tolerance was assessed in the 
single-dose PK study in rabbits (study 26668 (GP15-006); as well as in the repeat-dose monkey toxicity study 
(study 8247055 (GP15-003).  
Erelzi was well tolerated after a single bolus injection in rabbits. In monkeys, after repeated injections (once 
every 3 days), Erelzi and Enbrel/EU showed similar skin rashes, erythema, edema and inflammatory skin 
reactions at the injection sites. Overall, Erelzi and Enbrel/EU showed similar local tolerance. 
Other toxicity studies 
No further specific safety concerns, based on the nonclinical data provided and clinical use of the reference 
product, warrants additional animal studies with the proposed biosimilar Erelzi, in accordance with the current 
EMA guidance Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active 
Substance: Non-clinical and Clinical Issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Erelzi  is  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product  to  Enbrel  (INN:  etanercept).  Etanercept,  the  active 
pharmaceutical  ingredient  of  Enbrel  and  Erelzi,  respectively,  is  a  dimeric  fusion  protein  consisting  of  two 
naturally occurring soluble 75 kDa TNFR linked to the Fc portion of an IgG1 antibody (TNFR:Fc). Etanercept in 
Erelzi is a protein produced from a CHO cell line using a CHO expression vector which was re-designed to allow 
expression of etanercept from one single gene encoding the same amino acid sequence as etanercept in the 
reference product Enbrel. As Enbrel, Erelzi is intended for subcutaneous injection. 
According to the CHMP guideline "Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use" 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), in the case of products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, 
peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient the ERA may consist of an 
adequate justification for the absence of specific study data. The proposed similar biological medicinal product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 29/81 
 
  
 
Erelzi is a recombinant protein and would be expected to react like a naturally occurring protein both in vivo and 
in the environment. No potential risk of the medicinal product to the environment has been identified and further 
ERA data are not required to accompany this marketing authorization application. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Biosimilarity is supported by the data on binding of soluble TNFα (sTNFα), and to human Fc receptors (FcγRI, 
FcγRII, FcγRIII and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)) using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore®), as well as 
binding to C1q using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  
A comparison of sTNFα and LTα neutralising capacity using a reporter gene assay suggested similar ranges of 
activity for Enbrel and Erelzi when all tested batches throughout development were considered.  
Another TNFα neutralisation cell based assay using the ability of etanercept to inhibit TNFα-mediated apoptosis 
suggested similarity, but the data presented were very concise. 
Binding of etanercept to transmembrane TNFα (tmTNFα) was evaluated in cell lines stably transfected with 
tmTNFα. A difference in binding for Enbrel and Erelzi was shown, apparently reflecting different levels of wrongly 
linked disulphide bridges. This difference was considered to be clinically not relevant due to rearrangement of 
disulphide bridges once the protein enters the body.  
Binding of etanercept to tmTNFα did not lead to caspase induction (in contrast to Remicade), suggesting 
absence of functional activity through this pathway. Etanercept did not suppress cytokine release subsequent to 
binding of etanercept to tmTNF, further supporting the view that this mode of action does not contribute to 
etanercept’s pharmacology.  
With regard to the ADCC assay the Applicant showed that Erelzi is approximately half as potent as Enbrel in an 
assay with an NK effector cell line and transgenic target cells expressing a protease-resistant, constitutively 
membrane-associated form of transmembrane TNF-α. The Applicant argues that this difference is clinically not 
relevant in the arthritic and psoriatic indications. One of the arguments is that most clinical pharmacogenomics 
data on polymorphisms for Fc gamma IIIA receptor suggest no or a limited role for this receptor, which is pivotal 
in mediating ADCC.  
Another argument presented is that the ADCC assay was developed to a very high level of sensitivity, in order 
to detect etanercept-mediated target cell depletion and provide a functional correlate of the observed 
differences in N glycosylation between Erelzi and Enbrel. The assay differs from the expected physiological 
environment in important aspects of the target cell population: the target cells employed in this assay express 
very high levels of a constitutively membrane-associated, protease-resistant pro-TNF-α, while putative 
endogenous target cell populations are expected to express lower levels of membrane-associated pro-TNF-α, 
which is subject to proteolytic shedding and therefore providing a less stable interaction platform between target 
and effector cells. Data obtained with U937 monocytes or primary human PBMC as target cells showed that in 
contrast to alemtuzumab, etanercept did not induce cell lysis at clinically relevant concentrations. Taken 
together, it has been sufficiently shown that the difference in ADCC observed in the highly sensitive transgenic 
target cells is not expected to translate into clinical differences.  
A difference in CDC has been observed. In this case Erelzi seems to be more active than Enbrel in a CDC assay, 
while the binding (measured by ELISA) of C1q was similar for both products. However, there is currently no data 
to support the clinical relevance of CDC for etanercept’s efficacy in the sought indications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 30/81 
 
  
 
The limited pharmacokinetic data in rabbits and monkeys do not raise concerns. However, for a more reliable 
and meaningful evaluation of the PK characteristics of Erelzi human data will always prevail. 
Changes in clinical pathology in the Erelzi and Enbrel/EU-treated groups were generally mild and did not differ 
significantly from control groups. However, individual animals showed some notable changes. These adverse 
effects are explained as an immunological response of animals when administered humanised therapeutic 
proteins. These reactions appear to be much more prominent than in the monkey studies described in the Enbrel 
EPAR. In the study submitted by the Applicant, these reactions were observed for both Enbrel and Erelzi treated 
monkeys. Injection site reactions occur frequently in humans after administration of etanercept, according to 
the SmPC for Enbrel (36% in RA, 13.6% in Psoriasis). In the pivotal clinical trial in Psoriasis performed by the 
Applicant, the incidence for Enbrel after 12 weeks of treatment was 14.2%, and 4.9% for Erelzi. Collectively, it 
can be concluded that the safety signals observed in the monkey study do not raise novel concerns and do not 
indicate differences between Enbrel and Erelzi. 
There is inter-animal variability and consequently the sensitivity of the study to detect differences between both 
products is limited, especially when considering the low number of animals that are used in non-clinical studies 
with non-human primates. A study like this would not have been required when guidance provided in the 
relevant biosimilar guidelines is taken into consideration. However, the study was performed before these 
(revised) guidelines were issued. In summary, the limited toxicology data provided do not raise concerns.  
In the comparative 4-week subcutaneous repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (8240755 
(GP15-003) immunogenicity was evaluated. In some monkeys of each administered group the development of 
anti-etanercept antibodies on Day 32 could be confirmed. Immunogenicity of humanised therapeutic proteins in 
animals is an expected reaction in animals when treated with these proteins and does not predict 
immunogenicity in humans. The ADA present in the monkey sera appeared to be completely cross-reactive with 
either Enbrel or Erelzi. This indicates there are no apparent differences in epitopes involved. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Comparable binding and activity of Erelzi and Enbrel has been shown for most parameters. Where differences 
were observed (ADCC), these have been properly addressed by the Applicant and it is not expected that these 
would translate into clinical differences. The non-clinical data support biosimilarity of Erelzi and Enbrel.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Four studies in healthy subjects and one sub-study in psoriasis patients (from the phase 3 study GP15-302) 
were submitted to support the pharmacokinetics part of the application.  
Studies GP15-104 (pivotal) and GP15-101 (supportive) compared the PK profiles of Erelzi and Enbrel/EU in 
healthy volunteers using 50 mg pre-filled syringe (PFS).  
Study GP15 -102 (supportive) compared the PK profiles of Erelzi and Enbrel/US in healthy volunteers using 50 
mg PFS.  
Study GP15-103 compared the pharmacokinetics of Erelzi in healthy volunteers administered by PFS and 
autoinjector (AI) presentations.  
Study GP15-302 (supportive), wherein PK in a subset of psoriasis patients was investigated by determining the 
trough concentrations during steady-state. 
Study GP15-101,  was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study with two treatment 
periods comparing a single-dose 50 mg sc injection of the test product Erelzi and reference product Enbrel/EU 
in  healthy volunteers under fasting state. Comparable bioavailability was shown only for the Cmax (ratio 0.91 
[0.82 – 1.01] but not for the AUC0- tlast (ratio 0.85 [0.78 – 0.93] and AUC0-inf (ratio 0.85 [0.78 – 0.92].

of etanercept between the two products are within the pre-specified range of 0.80 -1.25 for bioequivalence. A 
statistical testing using the nominal dose was also performed and the same results were shown. However, the 
upper limits of the 90%CI for AUC exclude 1.0. Similar results were observed in Study GP15-101. 
The supportive study GP15-103 comparing a single-dose 50 mg sc injection of Erelzi delivered via pre-filled 
syringe  (PFS)  and  autoinjector  (AI)  in  healthy  volunteers  under  fasting  condition  was  a  single  center, 
randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study with 2 treatment Periods.  The primary objective of the study 
was to show bioequivalence when Erelzi is administered by an AI or PFS. Other PK analyses, among others, 
included  repeat  primary  endpoint  analysis  by  weight  category.  Subjects  were  stratified  at  randomization  by 
body weight categories (low: 50 -79.9 kg; medium: 80 - 99.9 kg; high: 100 - 140 kg). The ANCOVA model was 
used and subject weight was included in the model as a covariate. The results are summarized below:

Comparable PK was demonstrated between the two delivery devices as the 90% CI of the ratio of the geometric 
means of the primary PK parameters are within the pre-specified range of 0.80 -1.25.  
In addition, in the multi-dose study performed in a subset of 147 out of 531 psoriasis patients in the pivotal 
efficacy and safety study (GP15-302), trough levels were comparable between Erelzi and Enbrel/EU. Steady–
state levels were already achieved at week 2 in line with the half-life of 70-100h of etanercept.  
A waiver is made to the reference product’s dossier regarding establishing ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion) of etanercept and PK studies in special populations (e.g elderly, renal patients). This 
is acceptable for a biosimilar drug.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Etanercept is a well-known TNFα inhibitor. TNFα is an inflammatory mediator which is over expressed in several 
auto-immune-disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Etanercept’s postulated mechanism of action 
concerns competitive inhibition of the binding of TNFα to the soluble TNF receptors (TNFR), which are involved 
in different types of arthritis and psoriasis. Etanercept, however, has low affinity to membrane bound TNFR, 
which are thought to be involved in inflammatory bowel disorders.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of Erelzi in comparison with EU Enbrel were evaluated in the pivotal Phase III 
Study GP15-302 in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis up to 12 weeks of treatment. High-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) serum concentration was measured as a PD marker of inflammation in this study. No 
formal equivalence exercises were performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 35/81 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The hsCRP levels were moderately increased at baseline in the study population. Less than 50% had a high 
hsCRP level > 10 mg/L at baseline. At week 4, roughly similar hsCRP levels were observed in the Erelzi and 
EU-Enbrel arms, which remained stable until week 12. See Figure 2 and Table 12 below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Four studies in healthy subjects and one sub-study in psoriasis patients (from the phase 3 study GP15-302) 
were submitted to support the pharmacokinetics part of the application: Studies GP15-104 (pivotal) and 
GP15-101 (supportive) compared the PK profiles of Erelzi and Enbrel/EU in healthy volunteers using 50 mg 
Assessment report

Page 36/81 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
pre-filled syringe (PFS). Comparable PK was not formally shown in study GP15-101 and was repeated as study 
GP15-104. 
Study GP15 -102 (supportive) compared the PK profiles of Erelzi and Enbrel/US in healthy volunteers using 50 
mg PFS. This study is considered less relevant to the current application as this was a study comparing the 
proposed product with Enbrel/US. 
The number and type of studies submitted to show comparable PK are adequate for a biosimilar application in 
line with EMA Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1).  
In study GP15-101, comparable PK was shown only for the Cmax but not for the AUC0- tlast and AUC0-inf. In 
the Statistical Analysis Plan, it was pre-defined that an analysis using adjusted dose (actual dose received by 
subject) can be performed in case comparable PK using nominal dose is not shown. When the primary analysis 
was repeated using actual dose administered (calculated from the pre-/post-injection PFS weight difference) 
and added as a covariate in the ANOVA model, the lower limit for AUC0-tlast achieved the required limit of 0.80 
(i.e. 0.8037). AUC0- inf was not part of the primary analysis. A post hoc analysis including operator as a fixed 
effect was also performed and also showed comparable PK between the two treatments. The Applicant decided 
to repeat the study based on the scientific advices given by PEI (Germany) and FIMEA (FI). 
The repeated study, which is presented as pivotal study GP15-104, has a similar study design and methodology 
as study GP15-101. However, there were some differences: among others, study site is different, subjects 
included only males while males and females were included in the 1st study, the drugs in the 2 periods of each 
subject were administered by the same operator while in the first study this was not the case and the analytical 
method used is the revalidated ELISA while the original validated ELISA was used in the first study. Both studies 
used the ANOVA model but the primary parameters were normalized by protein content injected in this repeated 
study.   
The 90% CI of the ratio of the geometric means of the primary PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞ 
of etanercept between the two products are within the pre-specified range of 0.80 -1.25 for bioequivalence. 
However, the upper limits of the 90%CI for AUC exclude 1.0, indicating a lower exposure of Erelzi compared to 
that of Enbrel/EU. Similar results were observed in Study GP15-101. 
It was adequately justified that the estimated lower exposure (i.e that the 90% CI for AUC did not include 1 and 
AUC was statistically significant lower for Erelzi than for Enbrel) does not preclude biosimilarity. The results of 
the pivotal pharmacokinetic study showing 90%CI for AUC within the required range of 0.80-1.25, however with 
exclusion of 1, but with similar tmax and t1/2, suggest comparable clearance. The similarity in clearance 
indicates the absence of intrinsic differences between the test and reference product. This is further supported 
by the observed similar plasma exposure in patients upon multiple dosing treatment with etanercept in the 
clinical study GP15-302.  
The study further showed that etanercept exposure decreases with increasing body weight. This observation 
had a clinical impact as in the pivotal efficacy and safety study (GP15-302) the proportion of patients with a PASI 
75 response rate was lower for patients weighing ≥ 90 kg (62.2-63.6%) compared to patients weighing <90kg 
(81.2-84.2%) (see Clinical Efficacy part). Similar efficacy results have been obtained for Enbrel (see EPAR 
Enbrel 2006). 
Analytical methods 
The assays used for etanercept measurements have some limitations, especially the one that was validated for 
the early studies. As that PK data was only supportive the main focus of assessment was in the pivotal PK study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 37/81 
 
  
 
GP15-104 and its validation. Overall, the assay is more robust and the validation appears properly done. 
Concerning the question on reliability of the method near higher assay range, the applicant has recognized the 
variability near the upper and lower detection limit of the assay range and therefore only the linear range of the 
method is used, thus ensuring integrity of all results. The applicant has also provided additional data concerning 
possible ADA interference and according to the results there is equal ADA interference between Erelzi and 
Enbrel. Furthermore, the dilutions used in the sample analysis lower the ADA levels below 1ng/ml, which in the 
presence of higher drug concentrations does not impact the PK data.  
For the ADA measurements a three-step approach has been used, involving a screening assay (MSD bridging 
assay), a confirmatory assay (inhibition of the screening signal) and an ELISA-based assay to detect neutralizing 
antibodies 
However, the approach to use several positive controls even if justified by the company, raised questions about 
the impact of these different positive controls on the relative immunogenicity results. The Applicant has 
provided further characterisation data for the positive controls used in ADA measurements and assay 
validations. However, due to the chosen different scales between the Ab results and high concentration ranges 
it is difficult to interpret the actual differences between positive controls analysed. It is recognised that the 
discrepancies do not affect the screening assay results, where the cut-off value is based on human serum, not 
on positive controls and that a low positive control is used in all analysis settings ensuring proper sensitivity of 
each measurement. Furthermore, considering that Erelzi and Enbrel seem to behave in a similar manner in the 
binding assay, the issue of characterisation and use of positive controls is considered resolved. However, for any 
future application for Erelzi containing immunogenicity assessment, the Applicant was advised to ensure that for 
each assay validation and corresponding sample analysis the same, properly characterised positive control Ab is 
used. 
The drug tolerance data from the validation report ba13019 suggested that the ADA assay would not be equally 
sensitive for both Erelzi and Enbrel. It was clarified that this is due to the differences in assay settings and the 
variability of the assay near the cut-point. In addition, binding data is provided demonstrating equal 
performance of the assay with both analytes. Thus, the concern of the different sensitivities of the ADA method 
is considered resolved. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Serum hsCRP was measured, as a PD marker of efficacy in the clinical equivalence Study GP15-302, in patients 
with plaque psoriasis. Though not formally tested, the data roughly indicate similarity in PD response between 
Erelzi and Enbrel. However, the PD data should be interpreted with caution and considered as supportive 
evidence only, since hsCRP is not a specific biomarker and infections may also induce a hsCRP response. 
Moreover, only a minority of the study population had increased hsCRP levels at baseline, and these percentages 
were not equally distributed over study arms. 
The hsCRP data provided some supportive evidence regarding therapeutic equivalence. Although some 
methodological shortcomings were noted, no additional PD studies are warranted, as there is no specific or 
validated biomarker available.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a clinical pharmacology point of view, Erelzi has shown to be similar to Enbrel.  
The remaining issues on clinical, bioanalytical methods and their validation are considered resolved. However, 
the CHMP recommended that for any future application for Erelzi containing immunogenicity assessment the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017

MAH should ensure that for each assay validation and corresponding sample analysis the same, properly 
characterised positive control Ab is used. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose finding studies were performed, which is acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A randomized, double-blind, multicentre study to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and to compare safety and 
immunogenicity of a biosimilar etanercept (Erelzi) and Enbrel in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque 
type psoriasis (EGALITY) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years, diagnosis of active, but clinically stable, chronic (i.e. ≥ 6 months) 
plaque-type psoriasis involving at least 10 percent of the body surface area (BSA), corresponding to a minimal 
PASI score of 10 (indicating moderate-to-severe psoriasis). Patients who were candidates for systemic therapy 
were eligible, with Investigator’s General Assessment score of ≥3, previously received at least one phototherapy 
or systemic therapy for psoriasis, or candidate to receive such therapy in the opinion of the investigator. 
The main exclusion criteria were: other types of chronic psoriasis than plaques psoriasis, active inflammatory 
diseases other than psoriasis, (increased risk of) central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders, 
history of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of malignancy of any organ system, 
plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or live vaccination within 6 weeks prior to 
baseline, unwillingness to limit UV light exposure during the course of the study, a total white blood cell count < 
3500/μL, or neutrophils < 2000/μL or platelets< 125000/μL or hemoglobin < 10.0 g/dL at screening, or the use 
of prohibited treatments (Table 13).

Treatments 
Treatment period 1 (Week 1-12) 
Patients were randomized to receive 50 mg subcutaneous injections of either Erelzi or Enbrel twice weekly. 
Treatment period 2 (Week 13-30) 
In treatment period 2, etanercept doses were lowered from 50 mg twice a week to 50 mg once a week, aligned 
with the SmPC posology for maintenance treatment of Enbrel. Subjects were either assigned to continue their

initially assigned treatment from treatment Period 1, or were assigned to the switching treatment arms, in a 3: 
2 ratio.  
Extension Period (Week 31-52) 
The allocated treatment regime of the extension period was allowed to be continued for an additional 22 weeks 
during the extension period.  
Concomitant treatment 
Permitted  concomitant  treatments  included  emollients  without  pharmacologically  active  ingredients,  and 
analgesic treatments.  
All permitted prior concomitant treatments had to be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before the first study 
drug administration. Dose adjustments of these treatments were to be avoided during the study. Patients were 
advised to limit exposure to UV light (including sunbathing and/or use of UV tanning devices) during the study 
to avoid possible effects on psoriasis. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
Demonstrating equivalent efficacy of Erelzi and Enbrel in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type 
psoriasis with respect to Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response rate at Week 12. 
Secondary objectives: 
-  To  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Erelzi  and  Enbrel  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic 
plaque-type  psoriasis  for  several  other  outcomes,  including  the  PASI  score  over  time  and  Investigator’s 
Global Assessment (IGA) 
-  To compare the effects of Erelzi and  Enbrel on health-related quality of life in patients with moderate to 
severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy variable was the PASI 75 response rate (i.e. proportion of patients showing at least a 75% 
improvement in PASI) after the first 12 weeks of treatment (Treatment Period 1).  
Key secondary endpoint was relative percentage of change from baseline in the PASI score at Week 12. 
Secondary endpoints in treatment period 1 and 2 included PASI 50, 75, and 90 response rates, investigator’s 
global assessment (IGA), and several health-related quality of life scores. IGA ranges from 0 (= clear skin) up 
to 4 (=severe lesions). 
In patients with concurrent psoriatic arthritis, HAQ-DI, a functional score was assessed. 
Sample size 
In literature PASI 75 responder rates at 12 weeks of study treatment were 49% for etanercept and 3-4% for 
placebo  (Leonardi  et  al.  2003;  Papp  et  al.  2005).  Hence,  the  observed  treatment  effect  size  of  Enbrel  was 
45-46%. Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the exact 95% confidence interval for the difference in the 
PASI 75 rates would be completely contained within the interval [−18%; 18%]. Based on the above described 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 41/81 
 
  
 
assumptions, a sample size of approximately 546 patients (to maintain 464 evaluable patients with an assumed 
drop-out and major protocol deviation rate of 15%) would provide a power of 90% to show equivalence between 
Erelzi and Enbrel, assuming an expected difference of 3%. 
Randomisation 
Treatment period 1 
At  day  1  of  treatment  period  1,  eligible  patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  Erelzi  or  Enbrel 
treatment. Randomization of treatment period 1 was stratified by body weight (i.e. <90 kg versus ≥ 90 kg) and 
prior therapy. The strata for prior therapy were defined as: a) no prior systemic therapy, b) any prior systemic 
therapy including biologic immune-modulating agents except for a TNF-alpha antagonist, or c), prior treatment 
with a TNF-alpha antagonist other than etanercept. 
Treatment period 2 
Patients who achieved a PASI 50 response, were re-randomized to one of four treatment arms (i.e. 2 continued 
treatment  arms,  2  switching  treatment  arms)  of  treatment  period  2,  in  a  3:2  ratio  between  continuous 
treatment and switching. Re-randomization for treatment period 2 was not stratified for body weight or prior 
therapy 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Primary analyses 
For the analysis of PASI 75, covariate-adjusted difference in response rates and corresponding 95% CI for the 
difference were calculated, using a logistic regression model. The following terms were included as factors in the 
model:  treatment  group,  body-weight  category  (<90  kg  or  ≥  90  kg),  and  prior  use  of  systemic  therapy. 
Therapeutic equivalence in terms of PASI75 will be concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
the PASI75 rates is completely contained within the interval (−18%; 18%). Missing values were imputed with 
non-response values regardless of the reason for the missing data. The primary analysis set consisted of the 
per-protocol population (PPS). In the full analysis set (FAS), all randomized patients were analyzed according to 
the treatment assigned to at randomization.  
Key secondary endpoint 
A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was performed with respect to the percentage change from 
baseline in the PASI score up to week 12. Treatment group (Erelzi/Enbrel), visit, body-weight category (<90 kg, 
or ≥90 kg) and prior systemic therapy were fitted as factors and baseline score for the PASI as continuous 
covariate. For this outcome, the equivalence criterion was predefined as -15%; 15%. 
The ATE (average treatment effect) is defined as the average of percent change from baseline in PASI scores at 
weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. This parameter is the weighted average (weights based on the time intervals between two 
consecutive visits in weeks) of the relative response to treatment. This outcome was designed to incorporate 
gradual change per visit -instead of change over a 12 weeks period as for the other key secondary outcome 
%change in PASI from baseline (as described above).

Recruitment 
Overall, 71 study centres enrolled patients in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Ukraine. 
Study period: First patient first visit: 24-Jun-2013; Last patient completed TP2: 29-Oct-2014 (data cut-off date 
for Week 30 analyses); Study completion date: 30-Mar-2015 (Last patient last visit Week 52). 
Data from the Extension Period (EP – Week 30-52) are only mentioned in the next sections in case of relevance 
to the discussion. 
Conduct of the study 
Treatment period 1 
Overall, 75.7% of randomized patients had at least one protocol deviation. A total of 34 patients (6.4%) were 
determined to have major protocol deviations during treatment period 1 and the proportion of patients with 
major protocol deviations was balanced between the Erelzi (6.8%) and Enbrel (6.0%) groups, with the most 
common being violations of visit windows (13 patients, 2.4% total), violation of inclusion and exclusion criteria 
(12 patients, 2.2% total) and use of prohibited medication (8 patients, 1.5%). 
Treatment period 2 
38.4% of patients had at least one protocol deviation. 5.6% of protocol deviations were major. The proportion 
of patients with major protocol deviations was lower in the continued Erelzi (4.0%) group than in the continued 
Enbrel (8.6%) group. The most common deviations were use of prohibited medication (8 patients, 1.6% total) 
and  violations  of  exclusion  criteria  (7  patients,  1.4%  total).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  major  protocol 
deviations was generally similar between the pooled continued groups and the pooled switched groups (6.3% 
vs. 4.6%). 
Treatment compliance 
During treatment period 1, 86.7% of Erelzi-treated patients and 86.5% of the Enbrel-treated patients missed 
none of the study treatment doses. More than 4 doses of study treatment were missed by 2.7% of Erelzi-treated 
and 4.5% of Enbrel-treated patients in this period. 
In treatment period 2, 90.9% of patients missed none of the study treatment doses. More than 4 doses of study 
treatment were missed by 4.6% of patients. Results were comparable for the different treatment groups. 
Inappropriate stratification 
Discrepancies with respect to stratification according to prior systemic treatment (i.e. no prior systemic therapy, 
any prior systemic therapy including biologic immunomodulating agents but no prior treatment with a tumour 
necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antagonist,  and  prior  treatment  with  a  TNF  antagonist)  were  discovered  between  the 
interactive response technology system and the applicant’s clinical database. It was decided to use the strata as 
recorded in the clinical database. Individual patient’s data were reviewed and –if necessary- re-stratified. 
57 Patients were re-stratified: 
-54 patients from ‘prior systemic treatment’ to ‘no prior systemic treatment’ 
-3 patients from ‘no prior systemic treatment’ to ‘prior systemic treatment’

Numbers analysed 
The study enrolled 531 patients. A total of 774 patients were screened at 71 study centres and 531 patients were 
randomized 1:1 to receive one of the treatments during TP1; 264 and 267 patients in the Erelzi group and Enbrel 
groups, respectively. The majority (511 patients, 96.2%) of randomized patients completed TP1. A total of 497 
patients were re-assigned to TP2 at Week 12. At the end of TP2, a total of 467 patients continued into the EP. 
Treatment Period 1 
All 531 randomized patients were included in the FAS on the basis of the intent-to-treat principle, and all of these 
patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were thus included in the Safety analysis set. Three of the 34 
patients with major protocol deviations were discontinued during TP1; 31 of the 511 patients who completed TP1 
were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations. Therefore, the PPS comprised 480 patients.  
All patients provided data for ADA assessment at baseline and were included in the Immunogenicity set. 147 
patients finally contributed to the PK set after 2 patients in the Erelzi group and 1 patient in the Enbrel group 
were excluded to incompliant administration (i.e. missed doses) of study drug.

Treatment Period 2 
All 497 re-assigned patients in the FAS received at least 1 dose of study drug and were thus included in the 
Safety analysis set. The PPS comprised 446 (89.7%) patients, after a total of 51 patients were excluded; 28 
patients due to major protocol deviations and another 23 patients who discontinued during TP2. While a total of 
25 patients discontinued in TP2; 2 patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy and so were still included in the 
PPS as non-responders, consistent with the definition of the TP2 PPS. All patients in the TP2 FAS were included 
in the TP2 Immunogenicity set.

Secondary arthritis outcomes 
The HAQ-DI assessment was performed in a total of 107 patients (20.2%) with a medical history of psoriatic 
arthritis.  
At baseline, HAQ-DI scores were similar Erelzi and Enbrel groups (0.9 in both groups, Table 23). Mean changes 
in HAQ-DI scores declined to similar extent for Erelzi and Enbrel groups from baseline.

The HAQ-DI also includes a 100 mm VAS pain score. At baseline, mean VAS of pain scores were roughly similar 
between the Erelzi and Enbrel groups (49.5 (SD 26.85) vs. 43.6 (SD 24.15)). The mean VAS scores of pain were 
similar between the Erelzi and Enbrel groups at Week 12 (31.6 (26.45) vs. 30.2 (SD 24.66) at Week 12, FAS 
population). No formal statistics for group comparisons were performed.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for stratification factors body weight (cut-off value 90 kg), the presence of 
prior systemic therapy, and region.  
In the per protocol set, the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 12 was comparable between the no 
prior systemic therapy subgroup (71.6% and 73.4% in the Erelzi and Enbrel groups, respectively) and any prior

systemic therapy subgroup (77.3% and 81.1% in the Erelzi and Enbrel groups, respectively). Difference in the 
PASI 75 responder rates for Erelzi and Enbrel were −1.8% (95% CI: −11.13%; 7.52%) and −3.7% (95% CI: 
−16.58%; 9.16%) for no prior systemic therapy and prior systemic therapy subgroups, respectively. However, 
as there were errors noted in the assignment to prior systemic therapy, re-analyses were requested (please see 
below).  
The proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 12 was numerically higher in the < 90 kg subgroup (81.2% 
and 84.2% in the Erelzi and Enbrel groups, respectively) than in the ≥ 90 kg subgroup (62.2% and 63.6% in the 
Erelzi and Enbrel groups, respectively). However, results of the body weight category subgroup analyses were 
consistent with the total primary efficacy results, with a difference (Erelzi − Enbrel) in the PASI 75 rates of 
−3.1% (95% CI: −11.89%; 5.72%) and −1.4% (95% CI: −14.83%; 12.02%) for < 90 kg and ≥ 90 kg 
subgroups, respectively.  
No regional differences were observed.  
Post-hoc analyses  
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint PASI75 were performed to evaluate the impact of errors in 
the assignment of subjects with or without prior systemic psoriasis therapy. In these analyses, the stratification 
factor was deleted from the statistical model. This was considered to be a conservative approach reflecting a 
worst-case scenario, since exclusion of the factor could no longer reduce variability of the patient population. 
The results were consistent with the primary analysis, demonstrating a difference in the adjusted response rates 
of -2.2 with the limits of the 95% confidence interval being [-9.82, 5.37] (for comparison: the respective results 
of the primary analysis were -2.3 [-9.85, 5.30]). 
An additional sensitivity/subgroup analysis (Table 20) was requested, excluding the 82 subjects with potential 
erroneous stratification based on prior systemic psoriasis treatment (in a way that only prior systemic psoriasis 
treatment used 6 months before inclusion were taken into account, whereas this should include any time before 
randomisation).  Since the Interactive Response Technology system used for stratification did not allow any 
correction afterwards, sensitivity analyses were performed excluding all the 82 subjects from the affected sites. 
The  predefined  similarity  criteria  were  still  met  for  primary  and  key  secondary  PASI  endpoints,  indicating 
robustness of the outcomes

stratification based on prior psoriasis treatments 
Switching data 
The proportion of patients achieving PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 were overall similar between the pooled 
continued and pooled switched treatment groups. The PASI 75 and PASI 90 response rates were overall steady 
over time from Week 12 up to Week 30 for all groups, i.e. switched groups or continuous treatment groups. The 
results of the analysis on the FAS were similar to those in the PPS. See Table 25 below. 
Neither was there a difference in switchers from Enbrel and switchers from Erelzi, with mean % change from 
baseline of -88.287 in the switched Erelzi group and -88.517 in the switched Enbrel group at Week 30 (at the end 
of TP2; PPS), and of -85.574 in the switched Erelzi group and -88.527 in the switched Enbrel group at Week 52 
(at the end of the Extension Period).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Choice of the disease model 
The choice of psoriasis as a model to evaluate therapeutic equivalence to the reference product product Enbrel 
(EU-authorised) is considered adequate. As demonstrated in the trial and known from historical data, psoriasis 
lesions are sensitive to change by the treatment with etanercept, and the response is specifically related to 
TNF-inhibition by etanercept. Moreover, the lesions can be scored independently by investigators, with limited 
inter-rater variability.   
In the CHMP scientific advice, concerns were expressed whether psoriasis may be a less suitable model, since a 
high variability is to be expected regarding prior treatments and disease severity (i.e. TNF-expression). Patients 
were stratified for prior treatments (systemic or not), and a wash-out for different prior treatments was included 
in the protocol. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate a significant effect of prior systemic psoriasis treatment 
status, further supporting the choice of psoriasis as a model to evaluate equivalence.  
Design of the study 
The active comparator (Enbrel from EU source) is considered adequate. No placebo was included. However, 
assay sensitivity could be considered established, since it is unlikely that an improvement of more than 50% 
from baseline would be achieved without treatment. Placebo response was reported to be very low in 
comparable study populations with moderate-severe psoriasis from other trials.  
Baseline characteristics were comparable between Erelzi and Enbrel assignments, and over the two study 
periods. The pooled analysis showed that the pattern of background and disease related characteristics were 
similar between treatment-continued and switching groups in Treatment Period 2. 
The main part of the equivalence trial has duration of 12 weeks. This is considered optimal to establish 
therapeutic equivalence, since the main response is achieved shortly after treatment initiation.  
After 12 weeks, a part of the population (~40%) was re-assigned to the switching arms in Treatment Period 2, 
where  subjects  switched  between  Enbrel  or  Erelzi  every  6  weeks.  The  data  demonstrated  maintenance  of 
efficacy under switching. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as only a portion of the study 
population switched etanercept treatment after 12 weeks, and carry-over effects are not excluded. These data 
are considered as supportive evidence for establishing equivalence in efficacy. 
Choice of the primary endpoint 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 55/81 
 
  
 
The primary endpoint (PASI75 responder rates) may not be considered optimal for establishing biosimilarity, 
because  responder  rates  may  be  less  sensitive  to  detect  differences  between  a  biosimilar  and  its  reference 
product, if any exists. However, the PASI75 is supported by mean changes from baseline of the absolute PASI 
score, early after initiating treatment of 6-12 weeks, which is considered a sensitive period to detect differences 
–as compared to steady state.  
Choice of the equivalence acceptance margin 
Based on treatment effect sizes from historical data, a margin of +/- 18% was pre-defined for the PASI75 
response rates. A margin of +/-15% was predefined for the key secondary outcome of mean percentage change 
from baseline (BL) in PASI scores. From a clinical perspective, the equivalence margins are considered too wide 
and not sufficiently justified, as these may include a relevant difference in effect size. Although the acceptance 
criteria are considered too broad, no questions were raised on this issue, as the actual 95% Confidence Intervals 
of these outcomes fell between smaller ranges (<10%). 
GCP Inspection 
A GCP inspection has been performed for the pivotal Phase III trial GP15-302 by the German Inspectorate 
(Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines - Paul Ehrlich Institut), on request of the EMA on Day 120.  
The main reason of the CHMP for requesting a GCP inspection were discrepancies noted between the interactive 
response technology (IRT) system and the sponsor’s clinical database regarding prior systemic psoriasis 
treatment, resulting in a significant number of subjects being wrongly stratified. The Inspectors concluded that 
the deletion of prior data of systemic psoriasis treatment (by an erroneous correction of a CRA) from IRT, which 
was a main trigger for requesting Inspection, could be reasonably explained. Root-cause analyses were 
performed, resulting in preventive actions of better coordination and communication between Sponsor and CRO 
for future studies.  
The Inspector also noted that underreporting of AEs, and their treatment relatedness, could not be excluded. 
Criticalities were noted regarding the GCP monitoring system, particular regarding Source Data Verification 
(SDV). 
Therefore, and aligned with the Inspectorate, a re-monitoring of 10 sites was performed by independent 
auditors, with the focus on Source Data Verification of the reported adverse events. The report of this 
re-monitoring exercise was finished in 22 December 2016. Data files of 104 subjects were re-monitored. In 
total, 12 TEAEs from 104 subjects were detected de novo based on source data verification, of which 7 were 
Injection Site Reactions for Enbrel. Investigators declared that they did not include the AEs in the CRF, as they 
considered the issues minor, self-limiting or not treatment-related. 
On Request of the CHMP, a ‘worst-case scenario’ extrapolation to the whole study population was performed, 
assuming similar underreporting rate that was observed in the subset of re-monitored cases for the total study 
population. No relevant changes in the incidence rates of patients with Adverse Events were predicted. A higher 
incidence of ISR was noted for Enbrel than for Erelzi in both the post-hoc estimates as the original data (see 
details under Clinical Safety section of this report). 
Moreover, re-inspection was targeted to Source Data Verification of Adverse Events and establishment of the 
stratification factor. The selection of independent CRAs was done in consultation with the Inspectors.  
Efficacy outcomes (PASI-scores) were not considered affected at Source Data Verification. 
It was not clear amongst investigators and CRAs, and also statisticians, how the stratification factor “prior 
systemic psoriasis treatment’ should be defined according to the protocol. Erroneously, this was wrongly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 56/81 
 
  
 
interpreted by CRA’s that this would only refer to systemic therapies of the last 6 months before entering the 
trial, instead of an unlimited period before the trial.  The correct definition was that any prior use of systemic 
psoriasis therapy, disregarding how long before entering the study, should lead to a positive identification. In 
contrast, for all other pharmacological treatments, including topical psoriasis treatment, only data were to be 
recorded for a period of 6 months before entering the study, possible leading to misinterpretations that a 6 
month period would also account for the systemic psoriasis therapy. It was difficult to establish how many 
sites/subjects were affected by this misspecification. 
In the pivotal clinical trial, multiple misspecifications were noted regarding stratification based on prior use of 
systemic psoriasis treatment. Source Data Verification at re-monitoring indicated that misspecification of the 
stratification factor was random for either treatment, and the Inspectors concluded that the divergence could be 
reasonably explained. Conservative sensitivity analyses excluding all subjects that may have been misspecified 
indicated that this stratification factor had no impact on final conclusions regarding equivalence of the primary 
and key secondary clinical outcomes. Also, literature was provided that this factor was not relevant for the 
response to other TNF-inhibitors. Since the sensitivity analyses revealed that there was no impact of this 
stratification factor, this issue could be considered resolved. 
GCP compliance is ultimately considered sufficiently guaranteed for the pivotal trial GP15-302, for the following 
reasons: During the study, on average 11.8 on-site monitoring visits took place per site. Blinding was not 
affected. Overall, the rate and nature of Adverse Events is similar as reported earlier for Enbrel. The AEs that 
were not included in the CRF could be traced down in the end. Re-estimating of the AE rates did not show major 
discrepancies from the originally reported data. More injection site reactions (ISR) were reported for Enbrel than 
for Erelzi, however, the totality of data (quality, pre-clinical) shows similarity. Moreover, similar rates of ISRs 
were reported before for Enbrel in psoriasis trials.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Therapeutic equivalence 
For the primary endpoint PASI75 at Week 12, the 95% CI of the difference between Erelzi and Enbrel was -9.85, 
5.30, and the a priori defined criterion of therapeutic equivalence (i.e. -18, 18%) was met. Also for the key 
secondary endpoint mean percentage change form baseline in PASI scores at Week 12, the acceptance criterion 
of -15,15% was met (95% CI of the difference : −3.47, 2.20). 
Robustness of the primary and key secondary outcome was demonstrated in secondary analyses in the FAS 
population. The conclusion from these primary analyses were also supported by the other secondary outcomes 
like IGA responders, PASI 50 and PASI 90 responders, and QOL scores, all indicating a high level of equivalence 
between Erelzi and Enbrel.  
The PASI 75 responder rates were overall lower for patients weighing ≥90 kg (62.2-63.6% for Erelzi and Enbrel, 
respectively), compared to patients weighing <90kg (81.2-84.2%). An effect of weight on the PK and clinical 
response has been reported previously for the reference product Enbrel (see EPAR Enbrel 2006). However, 
according to the SmPC of Enbrel, marketed since 2000, no specific dose adjustments are required for patients 
with increased body weight. The same approach should then be applied for the biosimilar product.  
Post-hoc analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of erroneous assignment as having no prior systemic 
therapy. There was no relevant impact on the outcomes of primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Data on PASI 75 and IGA responses by individual switched groups, up to Week 52, do not indicate any loss of 
efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 57/81 
 
  
 
Extrapolation to other indications 
A single study in psoriasis was performed. According to the EMA guidelines on biosimilarity, extrapolation to 
other indications may be accepted based on the total package of quality, pre-clinical, PK and clinical evidence.   
Extrapolation to other authorised indications of Enbrel is considered justified, since all conditions for which 
Enbrel is approved are characterized by increased levels of TNFα as prominent inflammatory mediator forming 
the necessary elements in the chain of pathophysiological events. Elevated levels of TNFα are found in the serum 
and synovium in the diverse arthritis indications and in psoriatic plaques. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of 
TNFα-binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNFα. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Equivalence regarding efficacy has been shown in a psoriasis model. Equivalence has been convincingly shown 
for primary endpoint PASI75 and secondary sensitive endpoints like mean percentage change from baseline in 
PASI scores, within small therapeutic margins. Maintenance of efficacy was established for both treatments till 
the end of the study at 52 weeks, also after switching.  
As discussed above, a number of subjects were wrongly assigned to the “no prior systemic psoriasis treatment” 
stratum.  Conservative sensitivity analyses, ignoring this stratification factor or excluding all possible affected 
patients, did not show any relevant impact of the stratification factor on the primary and key secondary 
outcomes. Therefore, efficacy outcomes are accepted, despite the uncertainties regarding the stratification 
factors. When additional source-data-verification was carried out, no relevant differences were found for PASI 
scores, indicating that efficacy outcomes were not significantly affected by GCP-violations. CAPAs (Corrective & 
Preventive Action Programs) will be implemented for future studies. Based on the analytical, non-clinical and 
clinical similarity of Erelzi to Enbrel extrapolation to the other indications of the reference product is accepted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data for Erelzi are available from four pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers (GP15-101, 
GP15-102, GP15-103, and GP15-104) and one confirmatory clinical efficacy and safety study in psoriasis 
(GP15-302). 
Exposure in healthy volunteers 
In the PK studies, 216 healthy volunteers were exposed to a single dose of Erelzi. In total, 192 Healthy 
volunteers were exposed to either Enbrel from the US market (n=54) or EU market (n= 138).  
Treatment period 1 of Study GP15-302 
In total, 264 psoriasis patients were exposed to Erelzi and 267 patients to Enbrel in Treatment Period 1. Mean 
duration of exposure to Erelzi and Enbrel was similar (80.6 (SD 9.7) versus 79.2 (SD 11.6) days).  
Treatment period 2 of Study GP15-302 
Hundred-fifty and 151 patients were exposed to Erelzi and Enbrel during Treatment Period 2, respectively. Mean 
duration of exposure to Erelzi and Enbrel was similar (117.1 (SD 15.4) versus 117.5 (SD 15.0) days).  
Extension period of Study GP15-302 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 58/81 
 
  
 
In the Extension Period (Week 31 to Week 52), 465 patients continued the study treatments (continued group: 
280 patients; pooled switched group: 185 patients). 
Adverse events 
Phase I studies: Occurrence of adverse events in healthy volunteers was similar between Erelzi treated subjects 
and Enbrel treated subjects. None of them were serious.  
Study GP15-302: 
37.5% of the psoriasis patients treated with Erelzi and 36.0% of patients treated with Enbrel experienced at 
least one treatment-emergent adverse event in Treatment Period 1 of the study (BL-Week12). In the Erelzi 
treatment group, 1.5% of patients experienced serious adverse events compared to 1.1% of patients in the 
Enbrel treatment group. Similar proportions of patients discontinued the study due to treatment-emergent 
adverse events (1.9% and 1.5% in the Erelzi and Enbrel group respectively).  
Most commonly affected system organ classes were infections and infestations (primarily nasopharyngitis), skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (primarily dermatitis allergic and pruritus), gastrointestinal disorders 
(primarily abdominal pain upper, diarrhoea, and toothache) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (primarily arthralgia and back pain).

Abbreviations: TEAE= treatment-emergent adverse event 
Post-hoc analyses following re-inspection 
As explained above, a re-monitoring of 10 sites was performed by independent auditors, with the focus on 
Source Data Verification of the reported adverse events. Twelve additional AEs were found that were not 
included in the Case Report Forms, and final dossier. None of them were serious. Two of them were worsening 
of psoriatic arthritis (both GP2015), one viral infection (Enbrel), one mild thrombocytopenia (GP2015), and one 
lipoma of the salivary gland (Enbrel). Seven AEs from 5 subjects were classified as non-serious Injection Site 
Reactions (ISR), all for Enbrel study arm. Investigators declared that they did not include the AEs in the CRF, as 
they considered the issues minor, self-limiting or not-related. According to the Investigator who noted 
‘worsening of psoriatric arthritis‘ in the Source Documents of two patients, these cases were already present 
before inclusion in the trial, and therefore not included in the CRF.  
On request of the CHMP, a “worst case scenario” extrapolation was performed, assuming a similar 
underreporting rate for the whole study population that was observed in the subset of re-monitored cases. This 
was performed for incidence rates of subjects with any AEs by treatment arm in Period 1see Table 24 below), as 
well as for the number of total events. Considering the 10 patients with newly identified AEs, 2 patients out of 
these 10 did not have any documented AE in the clinical database. The new AEs of these 2 patients were ISRs 
which occurred in the Enbrel arm in TP1. Therefore, the underreporting rate was 2 out of 104 patients, which 
results in a rate of 0.019. Applying the 0.019 underreporting rate to all 531 patients, the extrapolated incidence 
increases by less than 2 % for TP1, as well as for the total study. 
Based on the 12 findings in 104 patients during re-monitoring, assuming 12/104 is the additional event rate per 
patient, then applying this rate to all the patients in the whole study, the expected number of events would be 
61 additional AEs for the whole study which represent ~5% of the already reported 1175 AEs (938 non-ISR AEs 
plus 237 ISRs). 
In summary, when applying these worst case scenarios, there was no change in the overall clinical conclusions 
on safety of the study.

Long-term Safety 
The  combined  analysis  population  included  those  patients  who  were  not  re-assigned  at  Week  12,  but  were 
assigned to receive Enbrel (n=171) or Erelzi (n=164) for 52 weeks from baseline. The number of patients with 
at least 1 TEAE was comparable between the continued Erelzi group (98 [59.8%] patients reporting 307 TEAEs) 
and  the  continued  Enbrel/EU  group  (98  [57.3%]  patients  reporting  281  TEAEs).  The  incidence  of  SAEs  was 
similar  between  the  continued  Erelzi  and  continued  Enbrel  groups  (4.3%  vs.  4.1%).  Similar  proportions  of 
patients discontinued the study due to TEAEs in the continued Erelzi group (6.7%) and in the continued Enbrel 
group (4.7%). Regarding AEs of interest, there were no relevant differences of injection site reactions (Erelzi: 
8.5%, Enbrel 15.8%) and infections (Erelzi: 36.0%, Enbrel 32.2%) till Week 52.

Regarding the adverse events of special interest, neoplasms were reported more frequently in patients treated 
with GP2015 compared to those treated with Enbrel (6 versus 1).

Most were benign (two cases of naevus (both GP2015), one lipoma (GP2015), one case of tubular-villous 
adenoma of the colon with low grade dysplasia), and two cases of skin papilloma (one for GP2015, one for 
Enbrel).  There is no apparent relationship between the occurrence of this benign neoplasm and the use of 
etanercept.  
One of them, in the GP2015 assignment group, was malignant (a malignant melanoma in situ). However, 
causality cannot be considered, because the melanoma (reported after receipt of the histological diagnosis) had 
been excised prior to start of study treatment.  
Overall, infection rate is similar. Fungal infections were slightly more frequently for Erelzi (4 cases) than Enbrel 
(none).   
Injection site reactions were more common for Enbrel than for Erelzi (Week 52, Erelzi: 8.5%, Enbrel 15.8%). On 
general, these were of mild severity, not leading to an increased drop-out rate. 
Investigations ALT/AST and GGT were more frequently reported as AEs for Erelzi than or Enbrel. However, when 
looking at systematically monitoring of liver function test, no imbalance was observed (see subsection 
‘Laboratory findings’ below).  
The safety profile in switching subgroups (after week 12), was similar to patients who continued the same 
treatment from baseline on. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Occurrence of death, serious adverse events, and premature study discontinuation because of 
treatment-emergent adverse events during treatment period 1 and 2 is presented in Table 31. 
One patient died of cardiopulmonary failure while on Enbrel treatment in treatment period 1. The death was 
considered as not related to study treatment.

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
In the Healthy Volunteers PK studies, a total of 3 subjects had confirmed binding anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 
the follow-up visit (Day 65) with titers near the detection limit. All 3 subjects were in the treatment sequence of 
Erelzi/EU-Enbrel (with Enbrel in Period 2), and none of the ADAs were neutralizing. The binding ADA positive 
results were considered not clinically meaningful due to the very low titers and no other safety issues were 
identified. 
In Study GP15-302, there were no ADA-positive samples detected in the Erelzi group up to Week 52. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 65/81 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In contrast, 5 of the 267 patients in the TP1 Enbrel group (1.9%) had a confirmed positive binding ADA result, 
all  within  the  first  4  weeks  of  treatment.  Additionally,  one  subject  in  the  switched  Enbrel  group,  who  had 
undergone the last switch from Enbrel to Erelzi at Week 24, had a confirmed positive binding ADA result at Week 
36. For all patients, the obtained titer values were low and transient, and none of the ADAs had neutralizing 
capacity.  
Laboratory findings 
No meaningful changes over time or differences between treatment groups were observed for haematology and 
chemistry outcomes including Liver Function Tests, which were routinely monitored throughout the studies. The 
most frequently reported laboratory abnormality was ALT increment (< 3 x Upper Limit Normality), which was 
equally distributed over the treatments (Erelzi: 3.7% and Enbrel 4.1% in the extension period).  
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable for a biosimilar product. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the clinical development of Erelzi drug interactions have not been systematically investigated by the 
applicant. The identified and potential interactions of the reference product Enbrel/EU with other medicinal 
products also apply to Erelzi.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study discontinuation was low and 
comparable in the Erelzi and Enbrel treatment groups.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Etanercept has been widely used in clinical practice for about 15 years, with a well characterised safety profile. 
The main safety issues are characterised by the immunosuppressive action of etanercept. Erelzi has been 
developed as a proposed similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) to Enbrel. 
The overall proportions, nature and severity of adverse events can be considered similar between Erelzi and 
Enbrel. 
The fact that no ADA formation at all was observed for Erelzi, and the rate of local skin reactions was 
considerably lower for Erelzi than for Enbrel, might indicate that Erelzi may be less immunogenic than Enbrel. 
Reduced immunogenicity on itself is not considered a risk from a clinical perspective, and the small difference 
did not have a clinical impact and as such did not preclude biosimilarity. Notably, etanercept is also reported to 
have low immunogenicity has seen in several other studies in the literature. Thus, these findings are within 
expectations. 
Re-monitoring and Source Data Verification in a large subset (104 out of total study population of 531 subjects) 
revealed that a small number of AEs were not included in the CRF and final dossier. Although it is expected that 
all AEs from the source documents would be included in the CRF, a selection was made by some Investigators. 
Though such a selection is not preferred, this was accepted, as the data were traceable, and the incidence of 
non-reporting in the CRF was low and balanced.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Immunogenicity is low and transient for Enbrel and Erelzi in the Phase I studies. No ADAs were found for GP2015 
in the Phase III trial, whereas a few transient ADAs were reported for comparator Enbrel (EU source). This 
difference regarding immunogenicity in the Phase III trial is not considered clinically meaningful. 
The number and nature of adverse events were generally comparable between Erelzi and Enbrel.  
Erelzi has comparable safety to Enbrel.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
bridging report making reference to Enbrel. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the package leaflet and the outer carton for the purpose of providing 
instructions for use has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Erelzi (etanercept) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as a new biological.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Erelzi is a biosimilar product of the reference product Enbrel and is approved for the same indications including, 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and 
(juvenile) plaque psoriasis.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
One confirmatory, parallel randomised double-blinded trial was performed to demonstrate equivalence 
regarding efficacy and safety between the biosimilar etanercept product Erelzi and the reference product Enbrel 
from EU source, in 531 patients with moderate-severe plaque psoriasis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From the quality perspective  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 75/81 
 
  
 
Sufficient information has been provided on the manufacturing and control of Erelzi. It was demonstrated that 
when operating within the established input ranges for process parameters, a high quality medicinal product 
fulfilling its predetermined specifications can be reproducibly manufactured. The changes introduced into the 
manufacturing process during product development have been described in detail and their potential impact on 
product quality has been adequately addressed. 
Comprehensive physicochemical and biological comparability studies using state-of-the art analytical methods 
have been carried out in order to demonstrate biosimilarity on the quality level between Erelzi and the reference 
medicinal product, Enbrel. The comparability studies address the primary, secondary and tertiary structures, 
post-translational modifications, purity/impurity profile, biological activity, as well as the degradation profile. 
The differences observed with regard to N- and C-terminal variants, size variants, as well as the minor 
qualitative differences in N-glycans, have been properly discussed and are considered to have no impact on the 
clinical performance of etanercept.  
From a non-clinical perspective, it is considered that similarity between Erelzi and the reference product Enbrel 
was shown with regard to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the binding affinity to relevant receptors/ligands like TNF-alfa and Fc-receptors 
neutralisation of TNF-alfa and LT-alfa in reporter gene assays (RGA) and in an apoptosis assay 
Similar in vivo functionality in a rabbit arthritis model 
Similar pharmacokinetic behaviour 
Similar toxicity profile 
From a clinical pharmacokinetics perspective, comparable PK has been adequately demonstrated in the repeat 
BE study. The primary PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞ of etanercept between the two products 
are within the pre-specified criteria of 90% CI range of 0.80 -1.25 for bioequivalence (90% CI of the difference: 
AUC0-tlast: 88-95%, AUC0-∞: 87-94%, Cmax 98-109%). Equivalence is further supported by Ctrough data 
from the confirmatory study in psoriasis patients.  
In the Phase III trial GP15-302, equivalence regarding efficacy between the biosimilar etanercept product Erelzi 
and the reference product Enbrel, was shown for the primary endpoint PASI75 responder rates at Week 12, 
which was well within the predefined margins of equivalence of -18% to +18% in the per protocol analysis 
(mean difference-2.3, 95% CI -9.85%, 5.30%). Similar results were obtained in the full analysis set, including 
all randomised subjects. Also for the –more sensitive- key secondary outcome, the percentage of change from 
baseline in PASI scores up to 12 weeks of treatment the equivalence criteria of +/- 15% were met (difference of 
the means -0.64, 95% CI -3.47, 2.20). The primary and key secondary outcomes were further supported by 
other secondary outcomes like Physician’s Global Assessment, PASI50 and PASI90, and Quality of Life 
outcomes.  
Maintenance of efficacy was shown up the 52 weeks for continuous treatment of Erelzi and Enbrel from baseline, 
as well as in the switching groups.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance (see 
section 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall rate of adverse events was similar for Erelzi and Enbrel throughout the study (At week 12: 37.5% for 
Erelzi and 36.0% for Enbrel). No unexpected adverse events that were not already known for Enbrel were 
observed. 
The main adverse events were infections, which were all rated as non-serious. Overall, the rate of infections was 
similar between Erelzi and Enbrel (about 17-19%) up to Week 52.  
Injection Sites Reactions were more common for Enbrel (14.2%) than for Erelzi (4.9%) (TP1). None of them 
were serious.  
The rates of ADA formation were low and transient for Enbrel (less than 2%). No ADAs were detected for 
continued Erelzi treatment in the Phase III trial. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance (see 
section 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk balance is derived from the reference product, provided that the totality of 
evidence collected from the quality, non-clinical, and clinical data package supports the biosimilarity of both 
products.  
With regard to analytical similarity, high similarity is demonstrated in several respects.  
Comparable binding and activity of Erelzi and Enbrel has been shown for most parameters. Where differences 
were observed (ADCC), these have been appropriately addressed and it is not expected that these would 
translate into clinical differences. The non-clinical data supports biosimilarity of Erelzi and Enbrel.  
From the clinical pharmacokinetics point of view, comparable bioavailability was not formally shown using 
nominal doses in the first study (Study GP15-101) comparing Erelzi and EU/Enbrel. However, in the Study 
Analytical Plan, it was pre-defined that an analysis using adjusted dose (actual dose received by subject) can be 
performed in case comparable bioavailability using nominal dose is not shown. When the primary analysis was 
repeated using actual dose administered (calculated from the pre-/post-injection PFS weight difference) and 
added as a covariate in the ANOVA model, the lower limit for AUC0-tlast achieved the required limit of 0.80 (i.e. 
0.8037). Using the same study design, in the repeated study (GP15-104), the primary PK parameters Cmax, 
AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞ of etanercept between the two products are within the required 90% CI range of 0.80 
-1.25. However, the upper limits of the 90%CI for AUC exclude 1.0, indicating a lower exposure of Erelzi 
compared to that of Enbrel/EU. 
It was adequately justified that the estimated lower exposure (i.e that the 90% CI for AUC did not include 1 and 
AUC was statistically significant lower for Erelzi than for Enbrel) does not preclude biosimilarity. The results of 
the pivotal pharmacokinetic study showing 90%CI for AUC within the required range of 0.80-1.25, however with 
exclusion of 1, but with similar tmax and t1/2, suggest comparable clearance. The similarity in clearance 
indicates the absence of intrinsic differences between the test and reference product. This is further supported 
by the observed similar plasma exposure in patients upon multiple dosing treatment with etanercept in the 
clinical study GP15-302.  
Regarding clinical efficacy, therapeutic equivalence was evaluated in plaque psoriasis, which is considered a 
sensitive model to demonstrate equivalence. Altogether, it is concluded that therapeutic equivalence has been 
shown in the psoriasis model.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B-R balance is considered positive. Similarity has been adequately shown based on the totality of data from 
Quality, non-clinical and clinical perspective.  
Assessment report

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Erelzi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Erelzi is favourable in the following indication: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Erelzi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless 
contraindicated), has been inadequate. 
Erelzi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Erelzi is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not 
previously treated with methotrexate. 
Etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of 
joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and 
adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, 
methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response 
to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Etanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint 
damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302222/2017 
Page 79/81 
 
  
 
 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as 
indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have 
had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen 
and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are 
inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.

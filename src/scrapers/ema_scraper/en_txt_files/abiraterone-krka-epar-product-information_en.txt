4.2
Posology and method of administration
This medicinal product should be prescribed by an appropriate healthcare professional.
Posology
The recommended dose is 1 000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken 
with food (see “Method of administration” below). Taking the tablets with food increases systemic 
exposure to abiraterone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
Dosage of prednisone or prednisolone
For mHSPC, Abiraterone Krka is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.
For mCRPC, Abiraterone Krka is used with 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.
Medical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be continued 
during treatment in patients not surgically castrated.
Recommended monitoring
Serum transaminases should be measured prior to starting treatment, every two weeks for the first 
three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Blood pressure, serum potassium and fluid retention 
should be monitored monthly. However, patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure 
2
should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter (see 
section 4.4).
In patients with pre-existing hypokalaemia or those that develop hypokalaemia whilst being treated 
with Abiraterone Krka, consider maintaining the patient’s potassium level at ≥ 4.0 mM.
For patients who develop Grade ≥ 3 toxicities including hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and 
other non-mineralocorticoid toxicities, treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical 
management should be instituted. Treatment with Abiraterone Krka should not be reinitiated until 
symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.
In the event of a missed daily dose of either Abiraterone Krka, prednisone or prednisolone, treatment 
should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
Hepatotoxicity
For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increases 
or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increases above 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), 
treatment should be withheld immediately (see section 4.4). Re-treatment following return of liver 
function tests to the patient’s baseline may be given at a reduced dose of 500 mg (one tablet) once 
daily. For patients being re-treated, serum transaminases should be monitored at a minimum of every 
two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 
500 mg daily, treatment should be discontinued.
If patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, 
treatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). However, there 
is no clinical experience in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is 
advised in these patients (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh 
Class A.
Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure 
to abiraterone by approximately four-fold following single oral doses of abiraterone acetate 1 000 mg 
(see section 5.2). There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone 
acetate when administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
B or C). No dose adjustment can be predicted. The use of Abiraterone Krka should be cautiously 
assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh 
the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Abiraterone Krka should not be used in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of Abiraterone Krka in the paediatric population.
Method of administration
Abiraterone Krka is for oral use.
The tablets must be taken as a single dose once daily on an empty stomach. Abiraterone Krka must be 
taken at least two hours after eating and food must not be eaten for at least one hour after taking 
Abiraterone Krka. 
Abiraterone Krka tablets must be swallowed whole with water.

223.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypertension, hypokalaemia, fluid retention and cardiac failure due to mineralocorticoid excess
Abiraterone Krka may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention (see section 4.8) as a 
consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition (see section 5.1). 
Co-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting 
in a reduction in incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Caution is required in treating 
patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, 
hypokalaemia (e.g., those on cardiac glycosides), or fluid retention (e.g., those with heart failure, 
severe or unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia and those 
with severe renal impairment).
Abiraterone Krka should be used with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The 
Phase 3 studies conducted with abiraterone acetate excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, 
clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events 
in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III or 
IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection 
fraction measurement of < 50%. In studies 3011 and 302, patients with atrial fibrillation, or other 
cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical therapy were excluded. Safety in patients with left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (in study 301) or NYHA Class 
II to IV heart failure (in studies 3011 and 302) was not established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Before treating patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure (e.g.a history of cardiac 
failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or cardiac events such as ischaemic heart disease), consider 
obtaining an assessment of cardiac function (e.g. echocardiogram). Before treatment with Abiraterone 
Krka, cardiac failure should be treated and cardiac function optimised. Hypertension, hypokalaemia 
and fluid retention should be corrected and controlled. During treatment, blood pressure, serum 
potassium, fluid retention (weight gain, peripheral oedema), and other signs and symptoms of 
congestive heart failure should be monitored every 2 weeks for 3 months, then monthly thereafter and 
abnormalities corrected. QT prolongation has been observed in patients experiencing hypokalaemia in 
association with abiraterone treatment. Assess cardiac function as clinically indicated, institute 
appropriate management and consider discontinuation of this treatment if there is a clinically 
significant decrease in cardiac function (see section 4.2).
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment
Marked increases in liver enzymes leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification occurred 
in controlled clinical studies (see section 4.8). Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to 
starting treatment, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment, and monthly thereafter. If 
clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop, serum transaminases should be 
measured immediately. If at any time the ALT or AST rises above 5 times the ULN, treatment should 
be interrupted immediately and liver function closely monitored. Re-treatment may take place only 
after return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline and at a reduced dose level (see section 4.2).
If patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, 
treatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.
Patients with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis were excluded from clinical studies; thus, there are 
no data to support the use of Abiraterone Krka in this population.
There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate when 
administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). The 
use of Abiraterone Krka should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 
in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Abiraterone 
Krka should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).
4
There have been rare post-marketing reports of acute liver failure and hepatitis fulminant, some with 
fatal outcome (see section 4.8).
Corticosteroid withdrawal and coverage of stress situations
Caution is advised and monitoring for adrenocortical insufficiency should occur if patients are 
withdrawn from prednisone or prednisolone. If Abiraterone Krka is continued after corticosteroids are 
withdrawn, patients should be monitored for symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess (see information 
above).
In patients on prednisone or prednisolone who are subjected to unusual stress, an increased dose of 
corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after the stressful situation.
Bone density
Decreased bone density may occur in men with metastatic advanced prostate cancer. The use of 
Abiraterone Krka in combination with a glucocorticoid could increase this effect.
Prior use of ketoconazole
Lower rates of response might be expected in patients previously treated with ketoconazole for 
prostate cancer.
Hyperglycaemia
The use of glucocorticoids could increase hyperglycaemia, therefore blood sugar should be measured 
frequently in patients with diabetes.
Hypoglycaemia
Cases of hypoglycaemia have been reported when abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone 
was administered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving pioglitazone or repaglinide (see 
section 4.5); therefore, blood sugar should be monitored in patients with diabetes. 
Use with chemotherapy
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of abiraterone acetate with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not 
been established (see section 5.1).
Potential risks
Anaemia and sexual dysfunction may occur in men with metastatic prostate cancer including those 
undergoing treatment with Abiraterone Krka.
Skeletal muscle effects
Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated with abiraterone 
acetate. Most cases developed within the first 6 months of treatment and recovered after abiraterone 
acetate withdrawal. Caution is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal 
products known to be associated with myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.
Interactions with other medicinal products
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 during treatment are to be avoided unless there is no therapeutic 
alternative, due to risk of decreased exposure to abiraterone (see section 4.5).
Combination of abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone with Ra-223
Treatment with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone in combination with Ra-223 is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3) due to an increased risk of fractures and a trend for increased 
mortality among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic prostate cancer patients as observed in clinical 
studies.
It is recommended that subsequent treatment with Ra-223 is not initiated for at least 5 days after the 
last administration of Abiraterone Krka in combination with prednisone/prednisolone.
Excipient(s) with known effects:
5
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of two tablets, that is to 
say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effect of food on abiraterone acetate
Administration with food significantly increases the absorption of abiraterone acetate. The efficacy 
and safety when given with food have not been established therefore this medicinal product must not 
be taken with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Interactions with other medicinal products
Potential for other medicinal products to affect abiraterone exposures
In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1 000 mg, 
the mean plasma AUC∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, 
phenobarbital, St John's wort [Hypericum perforatum]) during treatment are to be avoided, unless 
there is no therapeutic alternative.
In a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects, co-administration of 
ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.
Potential to affect exposures to other medicinal products
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolising enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.
In a study to determine the effects of abiraterone acetate (plus prednisone) on a single dose of the 
CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan, the systemic exposure (AUC) of dextromethorphan was 
increased approximately 2.9 fold. The AUC24 for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of 
dextromethorphan, increased approximately 33%.
Caution is advised when administering with medicinal products activated by or metabolised by 
CYP2D6, particularly with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index. Dose reduction of 
medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolised by CYP2D6 should be 
considered. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 include metoprolol, 
propranolol, desipramine, venlafaxine, haloperidol, risperidone, propafenone, flecainide, codeine, 
oxycodone and tramadol (the latter three medicinal products requiring CYP2D6 to form their active 
analgesic metabolites).
In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone was increased 
by 46% and the AUCs for M-III and M-IV, the active metabolites of pioglitazone, each decreased by 
10% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1 000 mg abiraterone acetate. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow 
therapeutic index if used concomitantly. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8 
include pioglitazone and repaglinide (see section 4.4).
In vitro, the major metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate were shown to 
inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence it may increase the 
concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to 
confirm transporter based interaction.
Use with products known to prolong QT interval
Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, caution is advised when 
6
administering Abiraterone Krka with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or 
medicinal products able to induce torsades de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) 
or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, 
methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc.
Use with spironolactone
Spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. 
Use with Abiraterone Krka is not recommended (see section 5.1).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
There are no human data on the use of abiraterone in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for 
use in women of childbearing potential.
Contraception in males and females
It is not known whether abiraterone or its metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required if 
the patient is engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient is engaged in sex with a 
woman of childbearing potential, a condom is required along with another effective contraceptive 
method. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Pregnancy
Abiraterone Krka is not for use in women and is contraindicated in women who are or may potentially 
be pregnant (see section 4.3 and 5.3).
Breast-feeding
Abiraterone Krka is not for use in women.
Fertility
Abiraterone acetate affected fertility in male and female rats, but these effects were fully reversible 
(see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abiraterone Krka has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with abiraterone acetate, adverse 
reactions that were observed in ≥10% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension 
urinary tract infection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase 
increased. Other important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and 
allergic alveolitis.
Abiraterone may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic 
consequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse 
reactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients treated 
with placebo: hypokalaemia 18% vs.8%, hypertension 22% vs. 16% and fluid retention (peripheral 
oedema) 23% vs. 17%, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate versus patients treated 
with placebo, CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6% versus 1%, 
CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 7% versus 5%, and fluid 
retention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1% versus 1% of patients, 
respectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. 
Concomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see 
section 4.4).
7
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
In studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or 
were previously treated with orchiectomy, abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1 000 mg 
daily in combination with low dose prednisone or prednisolone (either 5 or 10 mg daily depending on 
the indication).
Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed below by 
frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 
1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 
1/10 000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The following CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate: hypokalaemia 5%; urinary tract infection 2%; alanine aminotransferase increased 
and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased 4%; hypertension 6%; fractures 2%; peripheral oedema, 
cardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation 1% each. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia 
and angina pectoris occurred in < 1% of patients. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 4 urinary tract infection, 
alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypokalemia, cardiac 
8
failure, atrial fibrillation, and fractures occurred in < 1% of patients.
A higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive 
population (study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive 
population (study 3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively.
Hypokalemia was observed in 20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) 
compared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 301 and 302, respectively).
The incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroup of patients with baseline 
ECOG2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (≥75 years).
Description of selected adverse reactions
Cardiovascular reactions
The three Phase 3 studies excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant heart 
disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, 
severe or unstable angina, or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart 
failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of < 50%. All patients enrolled 
(both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen deprivation 
therapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with diabetes, 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of 
cardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus 
patients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, 
angina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%.
Hepatotoxicity
Hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST 
increases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of 
patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. 
In Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with abiraterone. 
Ten patients who received abiraterone were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; two had Grade 2 
hepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. No patient died of 
hepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose baseline ALT or AST 
were elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than those beginning with 
normal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations in bilirubin > 3 x 
ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two instances marked 
increases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with normal baseline 
hepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin elevations 2 to 6 x 
ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their liver function tests 
and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, Grade 3 or 4 ALT or 
AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone acetate. 
Aminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver metastases and 1 
with AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate). In Phase 3 
clinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic 
function were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% of patients treated 
with placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.
In clinical studies, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline 
hepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 study, patients with baseline 
ALT and AST > 2.5 X ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 X ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral 
hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were 
excluded. In the 301 study, patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver 
metastases and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 study, patients 
with liver metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN were 
excluded. Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical studies were 
vigorously managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return 
of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or 
9
AST > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The 
mechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Human experience of overdose with abiraterone is limited.
There is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, administration should be withheld and 
general supportive measures undertaken, including monitoring for arrhythmias, hypokalaemia and for 
signs and symptoms of fluid retention. Liver function also should be assessed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, other hormone antagonists and related agents, ATC
code: L02BX03
Mechanism of action
Abiraterone acetate is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. 
Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This 
enzyme is expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal and prostatic 
tumour tissues. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone 
precursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, by 17α-hydroxylation and cleavage of the 
C17,20 bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals 
(see section 4.4).
Androgen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. 
Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with LHRH analogues or orchiectomy, decrease 
androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the 
tumour. Treatment with abiraterone acetate decreases serum testosterone to undetectable levels (using 
commercial assays) when given with LHRH analogues (or orchiectomy).
Pharmacodynamic effects
Abiraterone acetate decreases serum testosterone and other androgens to levels lower than those 
achieved by the use of LHRH analogues alone or by orchiectomy. This results from the selective 
inhibition of the CYP17 enzyme required for androgen biosynthesis. PSA serves as a biomarker in 
patients with prostate cancer. In a Phase 3 clinical study of patients who failed prior chemotherapy 
with taxanes, 38% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate, versus 10% of patients treated with 
placebo, had at least a 50% decline from baseline in PSA levels.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Efficacy was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre Phase 3 clinical studies 
(studies 3011, 302 and 301) of patients with mHSPC and mCRPC. Study 3011 enrolled patients who 
were newly diagnosed (within 3 months of randomisation) mHSPC who had high-risk prognostic 
factors. High-risk prognosis was defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) 
Gleason score of ≥8; (2) presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) presence of measurable 
visceral (excluding lymph node disease) metastasis. In the active arm, Abiraterone acetate was 
administered at a dose of 1 000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone 5 mg once daily in 
10
addition to ADT (LHRH agonist or orchiectomy), which was the standard of care treatment. Patients 
in the control arm received ADT and placebos for both abiraterone acetate and prednisone. Study 302 
enrolled docetaxel naïve patients; whereas, study 301 enrolled patients who had received prior 
docetaxel. Patients were using an LHRH analogue or were previously treated with orchiectomy. In the 
active treatment arm, abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1 000 mg daily in combination 
with low dose prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Control patients received placebo and low 
dose prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.
Changes in PSA serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. Therefore, 
in all studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until 
discontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study.
In all studies spironolactone use was not allowed as spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and 
may increase PSA levels.
Study 3011 (patients with newly diagnosed high risk mHSPC)
In Study 3011, (n=1199) the median age of enrolled patients was 67 years. The number of patients 
treated with abiraterone acetate by racial group was Caucasian 832 (69.4%), Asian 246 (20.5%), Black 
or African American 25 (2.1%), other 80 (6.7%), unknown/not reported 13 (1.1%), and American 
Indian or Alaska Native 3 (0.3%). The ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 for 97% of patients. 
Patients with known brain metastasis, uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or NYHA 
Class II-IV heart failure were excluded. Patients that were treated with prior pharmacotherapy, 
radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer were excluded with the exception of up to 3 
months of ADT or 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat symptoms resulting from 
metastatic disease. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic 
progression-free survival (rPFS). The median baseline pain score, as measured by the Brief Pain 
Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) was 2.0 in both the treatment and Placebo groups. In addition to the 
co-primary endpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to skeletal-related event (SRE), 
time to subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to pain 
progression, and time to PSA progression. Treatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal 
of consent, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or death.
Radiographic progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence 
of radiographic progression or death from any cause. Radiographic progression included progression 
by bone scan (according to modified PCWG2) or progression of soft tissue lesions by CT or MRI 
(according to RECIST 1.1).
A significant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 2 and Figure 1).

Abiraterone Acetat- -------Flacebo 
Subgroup analyses consistently favour treatment with abiraterone acetate. The treatment effect of AA-
P on rPFS and OS across the pre-specified subgroups was favourable and consistent with the overall 
study population, except for the subgroup of ECOG score of 2 where no trend towards benefit was 
observed, however the small sample size (n=40) limits drawing any meaningful conclusion.
In addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for 
abiraterone acetate vs. placebo treatment in all prospectively-defined secondary endpoints.
Study 302 (chemotherapy naïve patients)
This study enrolled chemotherapy naïve patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and 
for whom chemotherapy was not yet clinically indicated. A score of 0-1 on Brief Pain Inventory-Short 
Form (BPI-SF) worst pain in last 24 hours was considered asymptomatic, and a score of 2-3 was 
considered mildly symptomatic.
In study 302, (n = 1,088) the median age of enrolled patients was 71 years for patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone and 70 years for patients treated with placebo plus 
prednisone or prednisolone. The number of patients treated with abiraterone acetate by racial group 
was Caucasian 520 (95.4%), Black 15 (2.8%), Asian 4 (0.7%) and other 6 (1.1%). The Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of 
patients in both arms. Fifty percent of patients had only bone metastases, an additional 31% of patients 
had bone and soft tissue or lymph node metastases and 19% of patients had only soft tissue or lymph 
node metastases. Patients with visceral metastases were excluded. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were 
overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). In addition to the co-primary 
endpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to opiate use for cancer pain, time to initiation 
of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by ≥ 1 point and time to 
PSA progression based on Prostate Cancer Working Group-2 (PCWG2) criteria. Study treatments 
were discontinued at the time of unequivocal clinical progression. Treatments could also be 
discontinued at the time of confirmed radiographic progression at the discretion of the investigator.
Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies 
as defined by PCWG2 criteria (for bone lesions) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). Analysis of rPFS utilised centrally-reviewed 
13
radiographic assessment of progression.
At the planned rPFS analysis there were 401 events, 150 (28%) of patients treated with abiraterone 
acetate and 251 (46%) of patients treated with placebo had radiographic evidence of progression or 
had died. A significant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 4 and 
Figure 3).

However, subject data continued to be collected through the date of the second interim analysis of 
Overall survival (OS). The investigator radiographic review of rPFS performed as a follow up 
sensitivity analysis is presented in Table 5 and Figure 4.
Six hundred and seven (607) subjects had radiographic progression or died: 271 (50%) in the 
abiraterone acetate group and 336 (62%) in the placebo group. Treatment with abiraterone acetate 
decreased the risk of radiographic progression or death by 47% compared with placebo (HR = 0.530; 
14
95% CI: [0.451; 0.623], p < 0.0001). The median rPFS was 16.5 months in the abiraterone acetate 
group and 8.3 months in the placebo group.

A planned interim analysis (IA) for OS was conducted after 333 deaths were observed. The study was 
unblinded based on the magnitude of clinical benefit observed and patients in the placebo group were 
offered treatment with abiraterone acetate. Overall survival was longer for abiraterone acetate than 
placebo with a 25% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.752; 95% CI: [0.606; 0.934], p = 0.0097), but 
OS was not mature and interim results did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for statistical 
significance (see Table 6). Survival continued to be followed after this IA.
The planned final analysis for OS was conducted after 741 deaths were observed (median follow up of 
15
49 months). Sixty-five percent (354 of 546) of patients treated with abiraterone acetate, compared with 
71% (387 of 542) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A statistically significant OS benefit in 
favour of the abiraterone -treated group was demonstrated with a 19.4% reduction in risk of death (HR 
= 0.806; 95% CI: [0.697; 0.931], p = 0.0033) and an improvement in median OS of 4.4 months 
(abiraterone acetate 34.7 months, placebo 30.3 months) (see Table 6 and Figure 5). This improvement 
was demonstrated even though 44% of patients in the placebo arm received abiraterone acetate as 
subsequent therapy.

In addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for 
abiraterone acetate vs. placebo treatment in all secondary endpoint measures as follows:
Time to PSA progression based on PCWG2 criteria: The median time to PSA progression was 11.1 
months for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and 5.6 months for patients receiving placebo (HR = 
0.488; 95% CI: [0.420; 0.568], p < 0.0001). The time to PSA progression was approximately doubled 
with abiraterone acetate treatment (HR = 0.488). The proportion of subjects with a confirmed PSA 
response was greater in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (62% vs. 24%; p < 0.0001). In 
subjects with measurable soft tissue disease, significantly increased numbers of complete and partial 
tumor responses were seen with abiraterone acetate treatment.
Time to opiate use for cancer pain: The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain at the time 
of final analysis was 33.4 months for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and was 23.4 months for 
patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.721; 95% CI: [0.614; 0.846], p < 0.0001).
Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy: The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
was 25.2 months for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and 16.8 months for patients receiving 
placebo (HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.487; 0.691], p < 0.0001).
Time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by ≥ 1 point: The median time to deterioration in 
ECOG performance score by ≥ 1 point was 12.3 months for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and 
10.9 months for patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.821; 95% CI: [0.714; 0.943], p = 0.0053).
The following study endpoints demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in favour of 
abiraterone acetate treatment:
Objective response: Objective response was defined as the proportion of subjects with measurable 
17
disease achieving a complete or partial response according to RECIST criteria (baseline lymph node 
size was required to be ≥ 2 cm to be considered a target lesion). The proportion of subjects with 
measurable disease at baseline who had an objective response was 36% in the abiraterone group and 
16% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).
Pain: Treatment with abiraterone acetate significantly reduced the risk of average pain intensity 
progression by 18% compared with placebo (p = 0.0490). The median time to progression was 26.7 
months in the abiraterone group and 18.4 months in the placebo group.
Time to degradation in the FACT-P (total score): Treatment with abiraterone acetate decreased the risk 
of FACT-P (Total Score) degradation by 22% compared with placebo (p = 0.0028). The median time 
to degradation in FACT-P (Total Score) was 12.7 months in the abiraterone group and 8.3 months in 
the placebo group.
Study 301 (patients who had received prior chemotherapy)
Study 301 enrolled patients who had received prior docetaxel. Patients were not required to show 
disease progression on docetaxel, as toxicity from this chemotherapy may have led to discontinuation. 
Patients were maintained on study treatments until there was PSA progression (confirmed 25% 
increase over the patient’s baseline/nadir) together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and 
symptomatic or clinical progression. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer 
were excluded from this study. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.
The median age of enrolled patients was 69 years (range 39-95). The number of patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate by racial group was Caucasian 737 (93.2%), Black 28 (3.5%), Asian 11 (1.4%) and 
other 14 (1.8%). Eleven percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance score of 2; 70% had 
radiographic evidence of disease progression with or without PSA progression; 70% had received one 
prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and 30% received two. Liver metastasis was present in 11% of patients 
treated with abiraterone acetate.
In a planned analysis conducted after 552 deaths were observed, 42% (333 of 797) of patients treated 
with abiraterone acetate compared with 55% (219 of 398) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A 
statistically significant improvement in median overall survival was seen in patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate (see Table 7).

In addition to the observed improvement in overall survival, all secondary study endpoints favoured 
abiraterone acetate and were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing as follows:
Patients receiving abiraterone acetate demonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate 
(defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 38% vs. 
10%, p < 0.0001.
The median time to PSA progression was 10.2 months for patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 
6.6 months for patients treated with placebo (HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.462; 0.728], p < 0.0001).
The median radiographic progression-free survival was 5.6 months for patients treated with 
abiraterone acetate and 3.6 months for patients who received placebo (HR = 0.673; 95% CI: [0.585; 
0.776], p < 0.0001).
Pain
The proportion of patients with pain palliation was statistically significantly higher in the abiraterone 
group than in the placebo group (44% vs. 27%, p = 0.0002). A responder for pain palliation was 
defined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain 
intensity score over the last 24 hours without any increase in analgesic usage score observed at two 
consecutive evaluations four weeks apart. Only patients with a baseline pain score of ≥ 4 and at least 
one post-baseline pain score were analysed (N = 512) for pain palliation.
A lower proportion of patients treated with abiraterone acetate had pain progression compared to 
patients taking placebo at 6 (22% vs. 28%), 12 (30% vs. 38%) and 18 months (35% vs. 46%). Pain 
progression was defined as an increase from baseline of ≥ 30% in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity 
score over the previous 24 hours without a decrease in analgesic usage score observed at two 
consecutive visits, or an increase of ≥ 30% in analgesic usage score observed at two consecutive visits. 
The time to pain progression at the 25th percentile was 7.4 months in the abiraterone group, versus 4.7 
months in the placebo group.
Skeletal-related events
A lower proportion of patients in the abiraterone group had skeletal-related events compared with the 
placebo group at 6 months (18% vs. 28%), 12 months (30% vs. 40%), and 18 months (35% vs. 40%). 
The time to first skeletal-related event at the 25th percentile in the abiraterone group was twice that of 
the control group at 9.9 months versus 4.9 months. A skeletal-related event was defined as a 
pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing abiraterone acetate in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
advanced prostate cancer. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Following administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone and abiraterone 
acetate have been studied in healthy subjects, patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer and 
subjects without cancer with hepatic or renal impairment. Abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted in 
vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor (see section 5.1).
Absorption
Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate in the fasting state, the time to reach maximum 
plasma abiraterone concentration is approximately 2 hours.
Administration of abiraterone acetate with food, compared with administration in a fasted state, results 
in up to a 10-fold (AUC) and up to a 17-fold (Cmax) increase in mean systemic exposure of abiraterone, 
depending on the fat content of the meal. Given the normal variation in the content and composition of 
meals, taking abiraterone acetate with meals has the potential to result in highly variable exposures. 
20
Therefore, Abiraterone Krka must not be taken with food. Abiraterone Krka tablets must be taken as a 
single dose once daily on an empty stomach. Abiraterone Krka must be taken at least two hours after 
eating and food must not  be eaten for at least one hour after taking Abiraterone Krka. The tablets must
be swallowed whole with water (see section 4.2).
Distribution
The plasma protein binding of 14C-abiraterone in human plasma is 99.8%. The apparent volume of 
distribution is approximately 5,630 L, suggesting that abiraterone extensively distributes to peripheral 
tissues.
Biotransformation
Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolysed 
to abiraterone, which then undergoes metabolism including sulphation, hydroxylation and oxidation 
primarily in the liver. The majority of circulating radioactivity (approximately 92%) is found in the 
form of metabolites of abiraterone. Of 15 detectable metabolites, 2 main metabolites, abiraterone 
sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate, each represents approximately 43% of total radioactivity.
Elimination
The mean half-life of abiraterone in plasma is approximately 15 hours based on data from healthy 
subjects. Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate 1 000 mg, approximately 88% of the 
radioactive dose is recovered in faeces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present 
in faeces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the 
administered dose, respectively).
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was compared in patients with end-stage renal disease on 
a stable haemodialysis schedule versus matched control subjects with normal renal function. Systemic 
exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage 
renal disease on dialysis. Administration in patients with renal impairment, including severe renal 
impairment, does not require dose reduction (see section 4.2). However, there is no clinical experience 
in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is advised in these patients.
Hepatic impairment
The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was examined in subjects with pre-existing mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in healthy control 
subjects. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 000 mg dose increased by 
approximately 11% and 260% in subjects with mild and moderate pre-existing hepatic impairment, 
respectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.
In another study, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with pre-existing 
severe (n = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal 
hepatic function. The AUC to abiraterone increased by approximately 600% and the fraction of free 
drug increased by 80% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function.
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment. The use of 
abiraterone acetate should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment in 
whom the benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). abiraterone 
acetate should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).
For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, suspension of treatment and dose 
adjustment may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
21
In all animal toxicity studies, circulating testosterone levels were significantly reduced. As a result, 
reduction in organ weights and morphological and/or histopathological changes in the reproductive 
organs, and the adrenal, pituitary and mammary glands were observed. All changes showed complete 
or partial reversibility. The changes in the reproductive organs and androgen-sensitive organs are 
consistent with the pharmacology of abiraterone. All treatment-related hormonal changes reversed or 
were shown to be resolving after a 4-week recovery period.
In fertility studies in both male and female rats, abiraterone acetate reduced fertility, which was 
completely reversible in 4 to 16 weeks after abiraterone acetate was stopped.
In a developmental toxicity study in the rat, abiraterone acetate affected pregnancy including reduced 
foetal weight and survival. Effects on the external genitalia were observed though abiraterone acetate 
was not teratogenic.
In these fertility and developmental toxicity studies performed in the rat, all effects were related to the 
pharmacological activity of abiraterone.
Aside from reproductive organ changes seen in all animal toxicology studies, non-clinical data reveal 
no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6-
month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in the rat, 
abiraterone acetate increased the incidence of interstitial cell neoplasms in the testes. This finding is 
considered related to the pharmacological action of abiraterone and rat specific. Abiraterone acetate 
was not carcinogenic in female rats.
Environmental risk assessment (ERA)
The active substance, abiraterone, shows an environmental risk for the aquatic environment, especially 
to fish.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Abiraterone Krka is and what it is used for
Abiraterone Krka contains a medicine called abiraterone acetate. It is used to treat prostate cancer in 
adult men that has spread to other parts of the body. Abiraterone Krka stops your body from making 
testosterone; this can slow the growth of prostate cancer.
When Abiraterone Krka is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to 
hormone therapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy).
When you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or 
prednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in 
your body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.
2. What you need to know before you take Abiraterone Krka
Do not take Abiraterone Krka
-
if you are allergic to abiraterone acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).
if you are a woman, especially if pregnant. Abiraterone Krka is for use in male patients only.
if you have severe liver damage.
in combination with Ra-223 (which is used to treat prostate cancer).
-
-
-
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Abiraterone Krka:
-
-
if you have liver problems.
if you have been told you have high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low 
blood potassium may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems).
if you have had other heart or blood vessel problems,
if you have an irregular or rapid heart rate.
if you have shortness of breath.
-
-
-
32
-
-
-
-
-
-
if you have gained weight rapidly.
if you have swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs.
if you have taken a medicine known as ketoconazole in the past for prostate cancer.
about the need to take this medicine with prednisone or prednisolone.
about possible effects on your bones.
if you have high blood sugar.
Tell your doctor if you have been told you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart 
rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions.
Tell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or 
vomiting, as these could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. Rarely, failure of the liver to 
function (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death.
Decrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may 
occur.
Abiraterone Krka must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the risk 
of bone fracture or death.
If you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with Abiraterone Krka and prednisone/prednisolone, 
you must wait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine.
Blood monitoring
Abiraterone Krka may affect your liver, and you may not have any symptoms. When you are taking 
this medicine, your doctor will check your blood periodically to look for any effects on your liver.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. If Abiraterone Krka is accidentally ingested 
by a child or adolescent, go to the hospital immediately and take the package leaflet with you to show 
to the emergency doctor.
Other medicines and Abiraterone Krka
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is important because Abiraterone Krka may increase the effects of a number of 
medicines including heart medicines, tranquilisers, some medicines for diabetes, herbal medicines 
(e.g., St John’s wort) and others. Your doctor may want to change the dose of these medicines. Also, 
some medicines may increase or decrease the effects of Abiraterone Krka. This may lead to side 
effects or to Abiraterone Krka not working as well as it should.
Androgen deprivation treatment may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor if 
you are receiving medicine
-
-
used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);
known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems [e.g. methadone (used for pain relief and 
part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for 
serious mental illnesses)].
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.

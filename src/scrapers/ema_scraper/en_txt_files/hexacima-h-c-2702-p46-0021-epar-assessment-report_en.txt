This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this 
product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02). 
2.3.2  Clinical study 
Description 
Infants, males and females, 1 month of age, born from confirmed Hep B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
seronegative mothers (documented by a laboratory test done during the last trimester of pregnancy or 
immediately post-delivery) or from HBsAb seropositive mothers (documented by a laboratory test done 
before the last trimester of pregnancy) were to be included in the study and randomly allocated to one 
of the following two study groups in a balanced allocation (1:1 ratio): 
• Group A: were to receive DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine (study vaccine) at 2, 4 and 6 
months of age. 
• Group B: were to receive Hep B vaccine (Euvax B®) at 1 and 6 months of age and DTaP-IPV//PRP~T 
combined vaccine (Pentaxim™) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, according to the official vaccination 
schedule in place in Republic of Korea. 
In accordance with the National Immunization Program, a booster injection against diphtheria (D), 
tetanus (T), pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections had to be administered to 
study subjects during their second year of life (at 15 to 18 months of age). The booster immunization 
was not part of this study. Booster administration was to be performed using any commercially 
available DTaP and Hib vaccine(s) as per routine practice. 
Methods 
Study design 
Medical history was checked prior to inclusion as well as further vaccinations made between studies 
(HepA vaccination allowed). 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are as standard for vaccine trials in the EU. Diary cards were provided. 
Blood draws for immunogenicity were done D0 (baseline) and D30 post the 3rd dose. 
Reactogenicity was assessed during the first 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited AEs for 30 days and 
SAEs as well as AESIs during the complete trial duration. 
Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor’s 
laboratory in Swiftwater, USA.

Statistical Methods 
For each antigen tested, the non-inferiority of immune response was demonstrated if the 95% CI of 
the difference (tested study vaccine - reference vaccine) layed entirely above the clinically acceptable 
limit for non-inferiority (-10%) (alpha = 2.5%). The 95% CI of the differences were calculated based 
on the Wilson score method without continuity correction. 
The primary objective was reached if the non-inferiority was proven for all the antigens. The 
hypothesis of non-inferiority was tested on the per protocol analysis set (PPAS) and was confirmed on 
the full analysis set (FAS). 
The non-inferiority of the immune response to all Ags induced by the study vaccine one month after 
the third dose was tested against the responses observed against all Ags in a similar trial conducted in 
Latin America with the same study vaccine (i.e., DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T, study A3L24). 
Non-inferiority was demonstrated if, for each Ag, the 95% CI of the seroprotection / vaccine response 
rate observed one month after the third dose of study vaccine lay entirely above the reference value 
(expected response) minus the clinically-acceptable limit for non-inferiority (set at 10%) in a one-sided 
equivalence test (using an alpha of 2.5%).  
Immunogenicity criteria were described for available blood samples before the first dose and one 
month after the third dose of the combined vaccines. The following parameters were used: 
• GM of Ab concentrations (GMCs)/titers (GMTs) at pre-Dose 1 (for anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-Hep B, and 
anti-D) and one month post-Dose 3 (for all antigens) 
• GM of individual Ab concentrations/titers ratio: 
• post-Dose 3 / pre-Dose 1 (for anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-Hep B, and anti-D) 
• Percentage of subjects with concentrations/titers above predefined thresholds 
• 
Fold-rise rates: ≥ 2-fold increase in anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab concentrations (EU/mL) from 1 month 
pre-dose 1 (Visit 1) to 1 month post-dose 3 (Visit 5) 
• Vaccine response for PT and FHA antigens defined as post-dose 3 anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab 
concentrations in ELISA units (EU)/mL ≥ 4 x LLOQ if pre-vaccination concentration is < 4 x LLOQ or ≥ 
pre-vaccination concentration if pre-vaccination concentrations ≥ 4 x LLOQ 
Reverse cumulative distribution Curves (RCDCs) of individual concentrations/titers were presented at 
Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 5 (Day 180).

Immunogenicity results 
Primary endpoint: Non-inferiority of Hexyon versus Pentaxim+HepB for seroprotection or 
seroconversion was achieved for all antigens (Table 2).  
Secondary endpoints: GMTs in the Hexyon group were similar after doses 1 and 3 for anti-D and anti-
FHA. GMs for, anti-PT are lower in the Hexyon group.  For the antibodies only measured after the third 
dose (T, Polio 1-3 and PRP) slightly lower GMTs were seen in the Hexyon group for anti-Polio 1, anti-
Polio 3 and anti-PRP. All other antibodies had similar GMTs. Of note: Group B received only 2 doses 
of Hep B (months 1 and 6) whilst Group A received 3 doses (months 2,4 and 6) till the post-
dose 3 measurement, thus, GMTs are not comparable here. The GMTs for anti-HepB after the 
first dose are similar for both vaccines (Table 3). Results of the PP are similar in the FAS the data are 
not separately shown here. 
Exploratory endpoint: Non-inferiority of seroprotection and vaccine response respectively against the 
results from a similar study (A3L24) is shown (Table 5.4, study report), the rates for seroprotection 
and vaccine response are similar.

Safety results 
No deaths occurred in this study.  One case of fever (onset 6 days post vaccination, no other 
diagnosis) was judged as related to the Hexyon vaccination. No other SAEs related to the vaccines 
were reported. No (S)AEs led to discontinuation of the study. 
Otherwise similar event rates were seen for solicited local and systemic events in both groups in known 
frequencies. Frequencies and grades do not increase with additional doses. 
 No safety issues are identified. 
The safety profile remains unchanged. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Regarding immunogenicity the results are similar to what is known from former studies: 
Established thresholds of protection and accepted vaccine responses are achieved with Hexyon as well 
as with the comparator. GMs after the 3rd dose tend to be lower for Hexyon concerning different anti-
Polio serotypes and this time anti-PT and anti-PRP. Sadly, the results for anti-HB cannot be compared 
due to a difference in doses between the two groups. After the one dose GMs are similar at least. 
Overall, this study does not add new information regarding the immunogenicity. The clinical relevance 
of the tendency to lower titres is unknown but as thresholds are reached not expected to be dramatic. 
The safety profile remains unchanged.  
3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

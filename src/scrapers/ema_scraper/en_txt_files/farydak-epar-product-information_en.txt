CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Farydak, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior 
regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Farydak should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer

therapies. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose of panobinostat is 20 mg, taken orally once a day, on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 
10 and 12 of a 21-day cycle. Patients should be treated initially for eight cycles. It is recommended 
that patients with clinical benefit continue the treatment for eight additional cycles. The total duration 
of treatment is up to 16 cycles (48 weeks). 
Panobinostat is administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, as shown in 
Tables 1 and 2. The bortezomib and dexamethasone prescribing information should be consulted prior 
to the start of the combination treatment to assess whether a dose reduction is required. 
The recommended dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 given as an injection. The recommended dose of 
dexamethasone is 20 mg taken orally on a full stomach.

Monitoring recommendations 
Blood cell counts 
A complete blood cell count must be performed before initiating treatment with panobinostat. The 
baseline platelet count should be ≥100 x 109/l and the baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
≥1.0 x 109/l. Complete blood counts should be frequently monitored during treatment (in particular 
before each injection of bortezomib, i.e. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of cycles 1 to 8 and on days 1 and 8 of 
cycles 9 to 16), especially for thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). Prior to initiating any cycle of 
therapy with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, platelet count should 
be at least ≥100 x 109/l (see section 4.4). Additional blood counts should be considered during the 
“rest period” – e.g. on days 15 and/or 18, especially in patients ≥65 years and patients with a baseline 
platelet count below 150 x 109/l. 
ECG 
Panobinostat may increase the QTc interval (see section 4.4). Therefore an ECG should be recorded 
prior to the start of therapy and repeated periodically before each treatment cycle. QTcF should be 
<480 msec prior to initiation of treatment with panobinostat (see below section on dose adjustments 
and section 4.4). 
Blood electrolytes 
Blood electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium and phosphorus, should be measured at baseline 
and monitored periodically as clinically indicated, especially in patients with diarrhoea. Abnormal 
values should be corrected as clinically indicated (see section 4.4).

Liver function tests 
Liver function should be monitored prior to treatment and regularly during treatment as clinically 
indicated, especially in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). 
Thyroid function tests 
Mild hypothyroidism was reported in patients treated with panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone in Study D2308; some patients required treatment (see section 4.4). Thyroid and 
pituitary function should be monitored by measuring hormone levels (e.g. free T4 and TSH) as 
clinically indicated. 
Dose adjustments 
Modification of the treatment dose and/or schedule may be required based on individual tolerability. 
Clinical judgement on how to continue the treatment should be exercised when a patient experiences 
an adverse drug reaction. 
If a dose reduction is required, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced by decrements of 5 mg (i.e. 
from 20 mg to 15 mg or from 15 mg to 10 mg). The dose should not be reduced below 10 mg and the 
same treatment schedule (3-week treatment cycle) should be kept. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of bortezomib (i.e. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of 
cycles 1-8, see Table 1, and on days 1 and 8 of cycles 9-16, see Table 2). If patients experience 
thrombocytopenia, panobinostat may need to be temporarily withheld and the subsequent dose may 
need to be reduced (see Table 3). In patients with platelet count <50 x 109/l (complicated by bleeding) 
or <25 x 109/l, Farydak therapy should be withheld and resumed at a reduced dose upon recovery to 
platelet count ≥50 x 109/l. Platelet counts should be monitored at least twice a week until ≥50 x 109/l. 
Platelet transfusions may be required, if clinically indicated (see section 4.4). Discontinuation of 
treatment may be considered if thrombocytopenia does not improve despite the treatment 
modifications described below and/or the patient requires repeated platelet transfusions. Additionally, 
dose adjustment of bortezomib may be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 3).

At the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or onset of diarrhoea, it is recommended that the 
patient be treated with an anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product (e.g. loperamide). 
In the event of grade 3 nausea or grade 3 or 4 vomiting despite administration of an anti-emetic, 
panobinostat should be temporarily discontinued and resumed at a reduced dose on recovery to 
grade 1. 
Prophylactic anti-emetics should be administered at the discretion of the physician and in accordance 
with local medical practice (see section 4.4). 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia may require temporary or permanent dose reduction. Instructions for dose interruptions 
and reductions for panobinostat are outlined in Table 5.

In the event of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, physicians should consider the use of growth factors (e.g. 
G-CSF) according to local guidelines. Discontinuation of treatment may be considered if neutropenia 
does not improve despite the dose modifications and/or despite the addition of granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor therapy according to local medical practice and treatment guidelines, and/or in the 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
event of severe secondary infections. 
QTc prolongation 
In the event of long QT interval prior to initiation of panobinostat (QTcF ≥480 msec at baseline), the 
start of treatment should be delayed until pre-dose average QTcF has returned to <480 msec. In 
addition any abnormal serum potassium, magnesium or phosphorus values should be corrected prior to 
initiation of Farydak therapy (see section 4.4). In the event of QT prolongation during treatment: 
• 
The dose should be omitted, if QTcF is ≥480 msec or above 60 msec from baseline. 
• 
If QT prolongation is resolved within 7 days, resume treatment at prior dose for initial 
occurrence or at reduced dose if QT prolongation is recurrent. 
If QT prolongation is unresolved within 7 days, treatment should be discontinued. 
If any QTcF value is above 500 msec, Farydak therapy should be permanently discontinued. 
• 
• 
Other adverse drug reactions 
For patients experiencing severe adverse drug reactions other than thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal 
toxicity, neutropenia or QTc prolongation, the recommendation is the following: 
• 
CTC grade 2 toxicity recurrence or CTC grades 3 and 4 - omit the dose until recovery to CTC 
grade ≤1 and resume treatment at a reduced dose. 
CTC grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurrence - a further dose reduction may be considered once the 
adverse reaction has resolved to CTC grade <1. 
• 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Plasma exposure of panobinostat is not altered in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment. 
Therefore, starting dose adjustments are not necessary. Panobinostat has not been studied in patients 
with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
A clinical study in cancer patients with impaired hepatic function showed that plasma exposure of 
panobinostat increased by 43% (1.4-fold) and 105% (2-fold) in patients with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment, respectively. Patients with mild hepatic impairment should be started on 
panobinostat at a reduced dose of 15 mg during the first treatment cycle. A dose escalation from 
15 mg to 20 mg may be considered based on patient tolerability. Patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment should be started on panobinostat at a reduced dose of 10 mg during the first treatment 
cycle. A dose escalation from 10 mg to 15 mg may be considered based on patient tolerability. 
Frequency of monitoring of these patients should be increased during treatment with panobinostat, 
particularly during the dose escalation phase. Panobinostat should not be administered in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this population. Adjustment of 
bortezomib dose should also be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 6).

* Based on NCI-CTEP classification 
Elderly population 
Patients over 65 years of age had a higher frequency of selected adverse reactions and of 
discontinuation of treatment because of adverse reactions. It is recommended to monitor patients over 
65 years of age more frequently, especially for thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
For patients >75 years of age, depending on the patient’s general condition and concomitant diseases, 
an adjustment of the starting doses or schedule of the components of the combination regimen may be 
considered. Panobinostat may be started at a dose of 15 mg, and if tolerated in the first cycle escalated 
to 20 mg in the second cycle. Bortezomib may be started at 1.3 mg/m2 once weekly on days 1 and 8, 
and dexamethasone at 20 mg on days 1 and 8. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of panobinostat in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years in the 
indication multiple myeloma (see section 5.2). 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, 
including, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced to 10 mg 
(see section 4.5). If continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is required, a dose escalation 
from 10 mg to 15 mg panobinostat may be considered based on patient tolerability. 
In patients with hepatic impairment receiving concomitant medicinal products which are strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, treatment with panobinostat should be avoided due to lack of experience and 
safety data in this patient population. 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors should not be started in patients who have already received a reduced dose 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of panobinostat due to adverse reactions. If this is unavoidable, patients should be closely monitored 
and further dose reduction or discontinuation may be considered as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.5). 
Method of administration 
Farydak should be administered orally once daily on scheduled days only, at the same time each day. 
The capsules should be swallowed whole with water, with or without food (see section 5.2), and they 
should not be opened, crushed or chewed. If a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 12 hours after the 
specified dose time. If vomiting occurs the patient should not take an additional dose, but should take 
the next usual prescribed dose. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Panobinostat is used in combination treatment, therefore the prescribing information of bortezomib 
and dexamethasone should be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with panobinostat. 
Decrease in blood cell count 
Haematological adverse drug reactions, including severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia 
(CTC grade 3 to 4) were reported in patients treated with panobinostat. Therefore a complete blood 
count must be performed before initiating therapy with panobinostat, with frequent monitoring during 
treatment (in particular before each injection of bortezomib as per bortezomib SmPC). 
The platelet count should be ≥100 x 109/l and the absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 x 109/l prior to 
initiation of treatment. Platelet count should be ≥100 x 109/l prior to initiating any cycle of treatment 
(see section 4.2). 
In the phase III study, thrombocytopenia typically recovered to baseline by the start of the next 21-day 
cycle (see Figure 1). The median time to onset for grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was one month and 
the median time to recovery was 12 days.

In patients with CTC grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 109/l with bleeding) 
panobinostat may need to be temporarily withheld and/or the subsequent dose may need to be reduced. 
Platelet transfusions may be required as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhage has been reported in patients during treatment with panobinostat. CTC grade 3 or 4 
haemorrhage was reported in 4.2% of patients, including cases of gastrointestinal and pulmonary 
haemorrhage with fatal outcomes. Therefore, physicians and patients should be aware of the increased 
risk of thrombocytopenia and the potential for haemorrhage, especially in patients with coagulation 
disorders or in those who are receiving chronic anti-coagulation therapy. 
Infection 
Localised and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal 
infections such as aspergillosis or candidiasis, and viral infections including hepatitis B virus and 
herpes simplex, have been reported in patients taking panobinostat. Some of these infections (e.g. 
pneumonia) have been severe (e.g. leading to sepsis, or respiratory or multi-organ failure) and have 
had fatal outcomes (see section 4.8). Of note, whereas grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia were observed 
in 28% and 7% of patients, respectively, febrile neutropenia was observed in 1% of patients (see 
section 4.8). Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with 
panobinostat. 
Farydak treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Pre-existing infections 
should be treated prior to initiation of the therapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of infections during treatment with panobinostat; if a diagnosis of infection is made, 
appropriate anti-infective treatment should be instituted promptly and interruption or discontinuation 
of Farydak considered. 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, panobinostat should be discontinued and 
appropriate anti-fungal therapy instituted.

Gastrointestinal disorders 
Severe nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting, sometimes requiring the use of anti-emetic and 
anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products, have been reported in patients treated with Farydak (see 
section 4.8). Fluid and electrolyte blood levels, especially potassium, magnesium and phosphate, 
should be monitored periodically during therapy and corrected as clinically indicated to prevent 
potential dehydration and electrolyte disturbances (see section 4.2). 
Prophylactic anti-emetics (e.g. prochlorperazine) may be considered at the discretion of the physician 
and in accordance with local medical practice. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a known risk of 
QT prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be used with 
caution (see section 4.5). 
At the first sign of abdominal cramping, loose stools or onset of diarrhoea, it is recommended that the 
patient be treated with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product (e.g. loperamide) or any additional treatment 
in accordance with local treatment guidelines. Replacement intravenous fluids and electrolytes may be 
used as appropriate. Medicinal products with laxative properties should be used with caution because 
of the potential for exacerbation of diarrhoea. Patients should be advised to contact their physician to 
discuss the use of any laxative product. 
Electrocardiographic changes 
Panobinostat may prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT interval). 
No episodes of QTcF prolongation >500 msec were reported with the dose of 20 mg Farydak in the 
phase III clinical study, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Pooled clinical data from 
over 500 patients treated with panobinostat alone in multiple indications and at different dose levels 
have shown that the incidence of CTC grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec) was 
approximately 1% overall and 5% or more at a dose of 60 mg or higher; no episodes of torsades de 
pointes were observed. 
Additional analysis suggests that the risk of QTc prolongation does not increase over time (see 
section 4.2). 
QTcF should be <480 msec prior to initiation of treatment with Farydak. 
Appropriate monitoring of electrolytes (e.g. potassium, magnesium and phosphorus) and ECG should 
be performed at baseline and periodically during treatment, particularly in patients with severe 
gastrointestinal adverse drug reaction (see section 4.2). 
Farydak should be used with caution in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of 
developing QTc prolongation. This includes patients: 
• 
• 
with long QT syndrome. 
with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. 
Concomitant administration of medicinal products that are known to cause QTc prolongation should 
be used with caution (see section 4.5). 
In case of concomitant use of agents that may increase panobinostat plasma concentrations, such as 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment is required (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatic dysfunction, primarily mild transient elevations in aminotransferases and total bilirubin, has 
been reported in patients during treatment with panobinostat. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liver function should be monitored prior to treatment and regularly during treatment. If results of liver 
function tests show abnormalities according to the NCI-CTEP classification, dose adjustments for 
patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment are recommended and the patient should be 
followed until values return to normal or pre-treatment levels. Panobinostat should not be administered 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to lack of experience and safety data in this population. 
Adjustment of bortezomib dose should also be considered (see bortezomib SmPC and Table 6). 
Elderly population 
It is recommended to monitor patients over 65 years of age more frequently, especially for 
thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.8 and section 4.2). 
For patients >75 years of age, depending on the patient’s general condition and concomitant diseases, 
an adjustment of the starting doses or schedule of the components of the combination regimen may be 
considered (see section 4.2). 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Strong inducers may reduce the efficacy of panobinostat, therefore the concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, 
rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential taking panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone must use highly effective contraception for three months after stopping treatment (see 
sections 4.5 and 4.6 and bortezomib and dexamethasone SmPC). Women using hormonal 
contraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism events were reported in 8 of 381 patients treated with panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone in Study D2308, of whom 2 required treatment. Thyroid and pituitary function should 
be monitored by measuring hormone levels (e.g. free T4 and TSH) as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Farydak metabolism is through both non-CYP and CYP mediated routes. Approximately 40% of 
panobinostat is metabolised through CYP3A4. Metabolism via CYP2D6 and 2C19 was minor. 
Therefore, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the 
pharmacokinetics of panobinostat. Panobinostat is a P-gp substrate. 
Agents that may increase panobinostat plasma concentrations 
Co-administration of a single 20 mg panobinostat dose with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
increased the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared to when 
panobinostat was given alone. 
In patients who take concomitant medicinal products which are strong CYP3A and/or Pgp inhibitors, 
including, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone, the dose of panobinostat should be reduced (see 
section 4.2). 
Patients should be instructed to avoid star fruit, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, pomegranates and 
pomegranate juice, as these are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A enzymes and may increase the 
bioavailability of panobinostat. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agents that are predicted to decrease panobinostat concentrations 
The panobinostat fraction metabolised through CYP3A4 is approximately 40%. In clinical studies in 
multiple myeloma, the exposure of panobinostat was decreased by approximately 20% by the 
concomitant use of dexamethasone, which is a dose-dependent mild/moderate CYP3A4 inducer. 
Strong inducers are expected to have greater effects, and may reduce the efficacy of panobinostat, 
therefore the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), should be avoided. 
Agents whose plasma concentrations may be increased by panobinostat 
Panobinostat increased the Cmax and the AUC of dextromethorphan (a substrate of CYP2D6) by 
1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively, and it cannot be excluded that the effect may be larger on a more 
sensitive CYP2D6 substrate. Avoid panobinostat use in patients who are taking CYP2D6 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to, pimozide). When Farydak is 
co-administered with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, 
nebivolol, perphenazine and pimozide), dose titrate individual CYP2D6 substrates based on 
tolerability and frequently monitor patients for adverse reactions. 
Agents whose plasma exposure can be decreased by panobinostat 
Hormonal contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether panobinostat may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives. In addition, when panobinostat is administered together with dexamethasone, which is 
known to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the 
risk for reduced efficacy of contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal 
contraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
No data is available that can be used to exclude the risk that panobinostat could be a weak inducer of 
the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gastrointestinal tract. This could potentially lead to slightly decreased 
exposure to sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. 
Anticipated pharmacodynamic interactions 
Prolongation of QT interval 
Based on preclinical and clinical data, panobinostat has the potential to prolong the QT interval. 
Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other substances that are known to prolong the 
QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, 
moxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic medicinal products with a 
known risk of QT prolongation such as dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron and tropisetron should be 
used with caution (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Based on findings in animals, the likelihood of panobinostat increasing the risk of both foetal death 
and developmental skeletal abnormalities when administered to pregnant women is predicted to be 
high. Women of child-bearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to the initiation of 
treatment with Farydak and must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment and 
for three months after the last dose of Farydak. Women using hormonal contraceptives should 
additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of action, panobinostat can influence the quality of sperm formed 
during treatment. Sexually active men taking Farydak and their female partners should use a highly 
effective method of contraception during the man’s treatment and for six months after his last dose of 
Farydak. 
When panobinostat is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy 
of hormonal contraceptives needs to be considered. In addition, it is currently unknown whether 
panobinostat may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using 
hormonal contraceptives should additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical studies on the use of Farydak in pregnant patients. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive and embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Given panobinostat’s cytostatic/cytotoxic 
mode of action, the potential risk to the foetus is high. Farydak should only be used during pregnancy 
if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks to the foetus. If it is used during pregnancy or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while using it, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether panobinostat is excreted in human milk. Given its cytostatic/cytotoxic mode of 
action, breast-feeding is contraindicated during Farydak treatment (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Based on non-clinical findings, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Farydak (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Farydak has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur 
following administration of Farydak (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety data of panobinostat have been assessed from a total of 451 patients with multiple myeloma 
treated with panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone and from a total of 
278 patients treated with panobinostat as a single agent. 
The safety data reported below are based on the phase III clinical study (Panorama 1) in 381 patients 
with multiple myeloma treated with 20 mg panobinostat once a day three times per week, on a 
2 weeks on and 1 week off dosing regimen in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. 
The median duration of exposure in the study was 5.0 months. 15.7% of patients were exposed to 
study treatment for ≥48 weeks. 
The most common non-haematological adverse reactions were diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and 
vomiting. 
Treatment-emergent haematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia and 
lymphopenia. 
QTcF >480 and <500 msec was recorded in 1.3% of patients and change from baseline of >60 msec 
was observed in 0.8% of patients. No patient had an absolute QTcF >500 msec. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac events (most frequently atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitation and sinus tachycardia) were 
reported in 17.6% of panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients versus 9.8% of 
placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients and syncope events were reported in 6.0% 
versus 2.4%, respectively. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 36.2% of patients. The 
most common adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation were diarrhoea (4.5%), 
asthenia and fatigue (2.9% each) and pneumonia (1.3%). 
On-treatment deaths not due to the study indication (multiple myeloma) were reported in 6.8% of 
panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone-treated patients versus 3.2% of placebo + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone-treated patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions from clinical studies 
Adverse drug reactions from the phase III study (Panorama 1) are shown in Table 7. Adverse drug 
reactions are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, 
the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In 
addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the 
following convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be 
estimated from available data). 
Table 7 includes adverse drug reactions that occur due to the addition of panobinostat to the 
bortezomib and dexamethasone combination. The frequency category reflects the combination of all 
the medicinal products i.e. panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone. For adverse drug reactions 
that are related to bortezomib or dexamethasone treatment, please refer to the relevant SmPC.

Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
Gastrointestinal 
Gastrointestinal toxicity, primarily diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, is among the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions. However, treatment discontinuation due to these reactions was reported in 
a relatively small proportion of patients, with diarrhoea at 4.5% and nausea and vomiting at 0.5% 
each. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if severe gastrointestinal toxicity occurs and 
dose adjustment or discontinuation may be required (see section 4.4). 
Thrombocytopenia 
Due to the nature of multiple myeloma and the known haematotoxicity for panobinostat and its 
combination agent bortezomib, thrombocytopenia, often severe, has been frequently observed. CTC 
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 256 patients, with a median onset time of one month. 
However, thrombocytopenia is reversible (median time to recovery of 12 days) and can usually be 
managed by dose adjustment and interruption with or without platelet transfusion (see section 4.4). 
33.3% patients in the panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm and 10.3% patients in the 
placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm received platelet transfusions during treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia rarely leads to treatment discontinuation (1.6% of patients). Most patients with 
thrombocytopenia did not experience haemorrhage. 20.7% of patients experienced haemorrhage, most 
15 
 
 
 
 
frequently epistaxis (4.7%), haematoma (2.6%), and conjunctival haemorrhage (2.1%). CTC grade 3 
or 4 haemorrhage was reported in 4.2% of patients, mostly commonly involving gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage. Five patients (1.3%) died of events associated with haemorrhage. Amongst the patients 
who died of haemorrhage, one patient had thrombocytopenia grade 4, three patients had 
thrombocytopenia grade 3 and 1 patient had thrombocytopenia grade 1. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was frequently reported on the basis of laboratory findings determined during the study 
(all grades: 75%). Most newly occurring severe neutropenia was grade 3 (28%), with considerably 
fewer cases of grade 4 (6.6%). While many patients developed neutropenia, febrile neutropenia only 
occurred in a fraction of treated patients (1.0%, both for CTC all grades and for grades 3 and 4). 
Patients with neutropenia are prone to infection, mostly upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonia. 
Only 0.3% of the patients were discontinued from the treatment due to neutropenia. 
Fatigue and asthenia 
Fatigue and asthenia were reported in 41.2% and 22.0% of patients, respectively. CTC grade 3 fatigue 
was reported in 15.7% of the patients, and grade 4 in 1.3%. Grade 3 asthenia was observed in 9.4% of 
the patients, with no patients experiencing asthenia at CTC grade 4. The treatment was discontinued in 
2.9% of patients due to fatigue and asthenia. 
Infections 
Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients are at risk of infections. Potential contributing 
factors may include prior history of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, the nature of the disease and 
neutropenia or lymphopenia associated with Farydak treatment. The most frequently reported 
infections include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and nasopharyngitis. Fatalities 
involving either pneumonia or sepsis were reported. Treatment discontinuation due to infections was 
reported in 5% of patients. 
QT prolongation and ECG abnormalities 
QTc prolongation was observed and was mostly mild in degree: QTcF interval >450 msec and 
≤480 msec was reported in 10.8% of patients, with maximum increase from baseline >30 msec and 
≤60 msec in 14.5% of patients. QTcF >500 msec was not reported in any patient. 
ECG (electrocardiogram) abnormalities have been reported in patients treated with panobinostat + 
bortezomib + dexamethasone, mainly involving ST-T depression (21.7%) and T wave changes 
(39.6%). Regardless of events chronology, syncope was reported in 9% of patients with ST-T 
depression and 7.2% of patients with T wave change and 4.9% of patients with neither of these ECG 
abnormalities. Likewise ischaemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction and ischaemia) were 
reported in 4.5% of patients with ST-T depression and 4.8% of patients with T wave change and 2.7% 
of patients with neither of these ECG abnormalities. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
The incidence of deaths not related to study indication was 8.8% in patients ≥65 years of age 
compared to 5.4% in patients <65 years of age. 
Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 30%, 44% and 47% of patients 
aged <65 years, 65-75 years and ≥75 years, respectively. Grade 3-4 events more frequently observed 
in patients included the following (percentages presented for patients <65 years, 65-75 years and 
≥75 years of age, respectively): thrombocytopenia (60%, 74%, and 91%), anaemia (16%, 17% and 
29%), diarrhoea (21%, 27% and 47%), and fatigue (18%, 28% and 47%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Limited experience with overdose has been reported during clinical studies. Adverse reactions 
observed were consistent with the safety profile, with events primarily involving haematological and 
gastrointestinal disorders such as thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and 
anorexia. Cardiac monitoring and assessment of electrolytes and platelet counts should be undertaken 
and supportive care given as necessary in the event of overdose. It is not known whether panobinostat 
is dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors,  
ATC code: L01XH03 
Mechanism of action 
Farydak is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at 
nanomolar concentrations. HDACs catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of 
histones and some non-histone proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity results in increased acetylation 
of histone proteins, an epigenetic alteration that results in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to 
transcriptional activation. In vitro, panobinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and 
other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Increased levels 
of acetylated histones were observed in xenografts from mice that were treated with panobinostat. 
Panobinostat shows more cytotoxicity towards tumour cells compared to normal cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Treatment of tumour cells with panobinostat resulted in a dose-dependent increase in acetylation of 
histones H3 and H4 both in vitro and in xenograft animal pre-clinical models, demonstrating target 
inhibition. In addition, increased expression of the tumour suppressor gene p21CDKNIA (cyclin 
dependent kinase inhibitor 1/p21) gene, a key mediator of G1 arrest and differentiation, was triggered 
with panobinostat exposure. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
(Study D2308 – Panorama 1) 
The efficacy and safety of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone were 
evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III study in patients 
with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1-3 prior lines of 
therapies. 
Patients received panobinostat (20 mg taken orally once a day, three times per week, on a 2 weeks on 
and 1 week off dosing regimen), in combination with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected intravenously) 
and dexamethasone (20 mg). Treatment was administered for a maximum of 16 cycles (see Tables 1 
and 2). 
A total of 768 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone (n=387) or the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone (n=381) arm, stratified by prior 
use of bortezomib [Yes (n=336 (43.8%)), No (n=432 (56.3%))] and number of prior lines of 
anti-myeloma therapy [1 prior line (n=352 (45.8%)), 2 to 3 prior lines (n=416 (54.2%))]. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study 
arms. 
The median age was 63 years, range 28-84; 42.1% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 
53.0% of patients were male. Caucasians comprised 65.0% of the study population, Asians 30.2% and 
blacks 2.9%. ECOG performance status was 0-1 in 93% of patients. The median number of prior 
therapies was 1.0. More than half (57.2%) of the patients had undergone prior stem cell transplantation 
and 62.8% of the patients were relapsed after previous anti-neoplastic therapies (e.g. melphalan 
79.6%, dexamethasone 81.1%, thalidomide 51.2%, cyclophosphamide 45.3%, bortezomib 43.0%, 
combined bortezomib and dexamethasone 37.8%, lenalidomide 20.4%). More than one third (35.8%) 
of the patients were relapsed and refractory to prior treatment. 
The median duration of follow-up was 28.75 months in the panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone arm and 29.04 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm. 
The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) as per modified European Bone Marrow 
Transplant Group (mEBMT) criteria and as assessed by the investigator. In the overall patient 
population PFS based on the full analysis set (FAS) was statistically significantly different between 
the treatment arms (stratified Log-rank test p<0.0001, with an estimated 37% risk reduction in the 
panobinostat + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone arm (Hazard ratio: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.76)). The median PFS (95% CI) was 
12.0 months (10.3, 12.9) and 8.1 months (7.6, 9.2), respectively. 
Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint. OS was not statistically significantly different 
between the two treatment groups. The median OS was 40.3 months in the panobinostat + bortezomib 
+ dexamethasone arm and 35.8 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm (Hazard 
ratio: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.14)). 
Out of the pre-specified subgroup of patients with prior treatment with bortezomib and an 
immunomodulatory agent (N=193), 76% of patients had received at least two prior regimens. In this 
subset of patients (N=147), the median duration of treatment was 4.5 months in the panobinostat + 
bortezomib + dexamethasone arm and 4.8 months in the placebo + bortezomib + dexamethasone arm. 
The median PFS (95% CI) was 12.5 months (7.26, 14.03) in the panobinostat + bortezomib + 
dexamethasone arm and 4.7 months (3.71, 6.05) in the placebo + bortezomib + and dexamethasone 
arm [HR: 0.47 (0.31, 0.72)]. These patients had a median of 3 prior therapies. Efficacy results are 
summarised in Table 8 and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS are provided in Figure 2.

Clinical efficacy in patients with bortezomib-refractory multiple myeloma (Study DUS71 – 
Panorama 2) 
Study DUS71 was a two-stage, single-arm, open-label multicentre phase II study of oral panobinostat 
(20 mg) in combination with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) in 55 patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who were bortezomib-refractory and had received at least 
two prior lines of therapy. Patients had to be exposed to an IMiD (lenalidomide or thalidomide). 
Refractoriness to bortezomib was defined as disease progression on or within 60 days of the last 
bortezomib-containing line of therapy. 
The primary endpoint of the study was to assess overall response rate (ORR) after 8 cycles of therapy

as per mEBMT criteria. 
Patients were heavily pre-treated and had received multiple prior regimens (median: 4; range: 2-11). 
All 55 patients were previously treated with bortezomib and at least one IMiD (lenalidomide: 98.2%, 
thalidomide: 69.1%). The majority of patients had received prior transplant (63.6%). 
The median duration of exposure to study treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.1-24.1 months). Patients 
achieved an ORR (≥PR (partial response)) of 34.5% and 52.7% (≥MR (minimal response)). The 
median time to response was 1.4 months and the median duration of response was 6.0 months. The 
median OS was 17.5 months. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Farydak in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Panobinostat is rapidly and almost completely absorbed with Tmax reached within 2 hours of oral 
administration in patients with advanced cancer. The absolute oral bioavailability of panobinostat was 
approximately 21%. After oral administration, panobinostat pharmacokinetics appear to be linear in 
the dose range 10-30 mg, but AUC increases less than proportionally with dose at higher doses. 
Overall panobinostat exposure and inter-patient variability remained unchanged with or without food, 
whereas Cmax was reduced by <45% and Tmax prolonged by 1 to 2.5 hours with food (i.e. both normal 
and high-fat breakfasts). Since food did not alter overall bioavailability (AUC), panobinostat can be 
administered regardless of food in cancer patients. 
Distribution 
Panobinostat is moderately (approximately 90%) bound to human plasma proteins. Its fraction in the 
erythrocyte is 0.60 in vitro, independent of the concentration. The volume of distribution of 
panobinostat at steady state (Vss) is approximately 1,000 litres based on final parameter estimates in 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Biotransformation 
Panobinostat is extensively metabolised, and a large fraction of the dose is metabolised before 
reaching the systemic circulation. Pertinent metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of 
panobinostat are reduction, hydrolysis, oxidation and glucuronidation processes. Oxidative 
metabolism of panobinostat played a less prominent role, with approximately 40% of the dose 
eliminated by this pathway. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the main oxidation enzyme, with 
potential minor involvement of CYP2D6 and 2C19. 
Panobinostat represented 6 to 9% of the drug-related exposure in plasma. The parent substance is 
deemed to be responsible for the overall pharmacological activity of panobinostat. 
Elimination 
After a single oral dose of [14C] panobinostat in patients, 29 to 51% of administered radioactivity is 
excreted in the urine and 44 to 77% in the faeces. Unchanged panobinostat accounted for <2.5% of the 
dose in urine and <3.5% of the dose in faeces. The remainders are metabolites. Apparent panobinostat 
renal clearance (CLR/F) was found to range from 2.4 to 5.5 l/h. Panobinostat has a terminal elimination 
half-life of approximately 37 hours based on final parameters estimate in the population PK analysis. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Panobinostat was not evaluated in multiple myeloma patients under 18 years of age. 
Elderly population 
In the phase III clinical study 162 out of 387 patients were aged 65 years or over. Plasma exposure of 
panobinostat in patients aged 65 years or younger was similar to those older than 65 years in the 
pooling of single-agent panobinostat studies between the dose range of 10 mg and 80 mg. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat was evaluated in a phase I 
study, in 24 patients with solid tumours and with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment as per NCI-CTEP classification increased panobinostat plasma exposure 
by 43% and 105%, respectively. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Patients with renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat was assessed in a phase I 
study in 37 patients with advanced solid tumours with varying degrees of renal function. Mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment based on baseline urinary creatinine clearance did not increase 
the panobinostat plasma exposure in mild, moderate and severe groups. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity studies 
The primary target organs of toxicity following administration of panobinostat in rats and dogs were 
identified as the erythropoietic, myelopoietic and lymphatic systems. The thyroid changes including 
hormones in dogs (decrease triodothyronine (T3)) and rats (decrease in triodothyronine (T3), 
tetraiodothyronine (T4) (males) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) were observed at exposures 
corresponding to 0.07-2.2 of the human AUC observed clinically. 
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with panobinostat. Panobinostat has demonstrated 
mutagenic potential in the Ames assay, endo reduplication effects in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes in vitro. Additionally, in vivo DNA damage was observed in a COMET study in mouse 
lymphoma L5178Y cells and a dose-dependent molecular mechanisms study in murine bone marrow 
cells. The in vitro and in vivo findings are attributed to the pharmacological mode of action. 
Reproduction toxicity 
An increase in early resorptions was observed in female rats (doses ≥30 mg/kg). Prostatic atrophy 
accompanied by reduced secretory granules, testicular degeneration, oligospermia and increased 
epididymal debris were observed in dogs at exposures corresponding to 0.41-0.69 of the human 
clinical AUC and not fully reversible after a 4 week recovery period. 
Based on animal data, the likelihood of panobinostat increasing the risk of foetal death and 
developmental skeletal abnormalities is predicted to be high. Embryo foetal lethality and increases in 
skeletal anomalies (extra sternabrae, extra ribs, increases in minor skeletal variations, delayed 
ossification and variations of the sternabrae) were seen above exposures corresponding to 0.25 of the 
human clinical AUC. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effects of panobinostat on labour and post-natal growth and maturation were not evaluated in 
animal studies.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Farydak is and what it is used for 
What Farydak is 
Farydak is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance panobinostat, which belongs to a 
group of medicines called pan-deacetylase inhibitors. 
What Farydak is used for 
Farydak is used to treat adult patients with a rare type of blood cancer called multiple myeloma. 
Multiple myeloma is a disorder of plasma cells (a type of blood cell) that grow out of control in the 
bone marrow. 
Farydak blocks the growth of cancerous plasma cells and reduces the number of cancer cells. 
Farydak is always used together with two other medicines: bortezomib and dexamethasone. 
If you have any questions about how Farydak works or why you have been given it, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Farydak 
Do not take Farydak: 
- 
if you are allergic to panobinostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are breast-feeding 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Follow all your doctor’s instructions carefully. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Farydak: 
-

another medicine that you have not already been taking. 
Farydak with food and drink 
You should not eat star fruit, pomegranate or grapefruit or drink pomegranate or grapefruit 
juice during your treatment with Farydak, as they may increase the amount of the medicine that passes

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Due to the potential risk of death or malformation to the foetus, Farydak should not be taken during: 
Pregnancy 
- 
Farydak should not be taken during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit to the mother is greater 
than the potential risk to the baby. If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or plan to become 
pregnant, ask your doctor for advice. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking 
Farydak during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
- 
You must not take Farydak if you are breast-feeding. 
Contraception for women and men 
Due to the potential risk of death or malformation to the foetus, you should use the following methods 
of contraception while taking Farydak: 
For women taking Farydak 
- 
If you are a sexually active woman, you should have a pregnancy test before starting Farydak 
treatment and you must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with Farydak. 
You must also use this for three months after you have stopped taking Farydak. Your doctor will 
discuss with you which is the best method for you to use. If you use a hormonal contraceptive you 
must also use a barrier method of contraception (such as condom or diaphragm) in addition. 
For men taking Farydak 
- 
If you are a sexually active man, you should use condoms during treatment with Farydak. You should 
also do this for six months after you have stopped taking Farydak. If your partner is able to become 
pregnant she should also use a highly effective method of contraception during your treatment and for 
six months after. Tell your doctor straight away if your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking 
Farydak or during the six months following your treatment with Farydak.

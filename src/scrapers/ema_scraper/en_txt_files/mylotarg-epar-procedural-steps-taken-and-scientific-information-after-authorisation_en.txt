information based on interim results from study 
WI203680 - MyeChild 01-International Randomised 
Phase III Clinical Trial in Children With Acute Myeloid 
Leukaemia – Incorporating an Embedded Dose 
The major dose finding part of the paediatric study 
MyeChild 01 Investigated the number of doses of 
MYLOTARG 3 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 3 doses; each 
dose was capped at one 5 mg vial/dose) which can be 
combined safely with cytarabine plus either mitoxantrone 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Finding Study for Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in 
Combination With Induction Chemotherapy. This is a 
dose finding sub-study aimed to identify the 
optimum tolerated number of doses of GO 3 mg/m2 
(up to a maximum of 3 doses) which can be 
combined safely with AraC plus mitoxantrone or 
liposomal DAUNO in induction therapy. The company 
took also the occasion to update the date of the 
latest renewal in section 9 of the SmPC.

which may have a significant impact on the medicinal 
product and is not related to a protocol 
or liposomal daunorubicin in induction therapy. There were 
3 cohorts: Cohort 1 (n=15): Patients received a single dose 
of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2) on day 4 of Course 1 of induction 
chemotherapy. Cohort 2 (n=20): Patients received a single 
dose of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2) on days 4 and 7 of Course 1 
of induction chemotherapy. Cohort 3 (n=19): Patients 
received a single dose of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2) on days 4, 
7 and 10 of Course 1 of induction chemotherapy. The 
MyeChild 01 study is ongoing. The optimal dose of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients is not yet 
established. In the dose finding part of the paediatric study 
MyeChild 01 the safety profile was similar with that 
observed in the other studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
combined with intensive chemotherapy in adult and 
paediatric patients with de novo AML.

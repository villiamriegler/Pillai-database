2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1 Introduction 
2.1.1 Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The  therapeutic  indication  concerns  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  (age ≥6  to  <18 years)  with 
relapsed  or  refractory  systemic  anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-positive  anaplastic  large  cell 
lymphoma (ALCL) and forrecurrent or refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive unresectable 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT).  
Epidemiology  
ALCL is a rare disease that occurs in adults and children, and an aggressive NHL subtype of T- cell origin 
that may appear in the lymph node, skin, bone, or soft tissue that is characterized by the consistent 
expression of CD30 antigen (Amin & Lai, 2007; Falini et al, 1995; Falini et al, 1999; Savage et al, 2008).  
ALCL accounts for about 10-15% of pediatric NHL (Ward et al, 2014; Drexler etal, 2000; Burkhardt et 
al, 2005; Prokoph et al, 2018; Amin et al, 2007) and about 2-3% of adult NHL (Drexler et al, 2000; 
Mussolin  et  al,  2010)  globally.    ALCL  incidence  rates  range  from  1.5-7.8%  in  both  male  and  female 
children  from  0-19  years  of  age  (PDQ  Pediatric  Treatment  Editorial  Board).    Approximately,  100  new 
cases of pediatric ALCL are diagnosed in the US each year (Sandlund et al, 1996 and Lowe et al, 2013).  
Furthermore,  US  SEER  data  (2017)  showed  an  ALCL  rate  of  0.1 per  100,000  among individuals  0-19 
years of age, 0.2 per 100,000 among individuals aged 20-64 years, and 0.5per 100,000 for those ≥ 65 
years (Howlader et al, 2017).  Using incidence estimates from 2008, the incidence of ALK-positive ALCL 
in Europe ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000 among individuals under 14 years and was lower among 
those 15 to 39 years (0.04 to 0.10 per 100,000) (Ferlay et al, 2010).  According to published data, the 
proportion  of  relapse  in  the  pediatric  ALCL  population  is  in  the  range  of  25-35%  (Woessmann  et  al, 
2011). 
Biologic features   
The  2016  WHO  classification  identifies  3  separate  biological  entities  in  ALCL,  which  include  primary 
systemic  ALK-positive  ALCL,  primary  systemic  ALK-negative  ALCL,  and  primary  cutaneous  ALCL 
(Swerdlow et al, 2016).  The majority (84-90%) of ALCL in children has been reported to be ALK-positive 
(Burkhardt et al, 2005; Le Deley et al, 2008; Mussolin et al, 2010); whereas, studies have shown only 
~50%  of  adult  ALCL  contain  the  ALK  fusion  gene  (Gascoyne  et  al,  1999;  Mussolin  et  al,  2010).  
Approximately 70 to 80% of ALK-positive ALCL express the NPM-ALK fusion protein, which is derived 
from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, while the remaining 20-30% of translocations fuse ALK to other 
partners (eg, TFG, TPM3, TPM4) (Mossé et al, 2009). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The most common presenting features include lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, such as 
fever and weight loss; however, ALCL can also present with an unusual course of waxing and waning 
lymphadenopathy or other symptom constellations, which may confuse the initial diagnosis.  ALCL 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 7/149 
 
 
 
often presents with advanced stage disease and in extra-nodal locations, such as skin and bone.  In 
12% of patients, the presentation of ALCL will be complicated by features of concomitant 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Lung, bone marrow, and central nervous system (CNS) 
involvement has been found to be more common in patients presenting with HLH-associated ALCL, 
although the outcomes are similar to those without HLH. 
The diagnosis of ALCL requires a biopsy of affected tissue, nodal or extra-nodal. Samples are required 
to be adequate for morphologic and molecular analysis, and therefore fine needle biopsies are 
discouraged as they often do not provide adequate tissue for evaluation. The staging evaluation 
includes physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), and assessment of bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition, [18F] 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be helpful if available. 
While FDG-PET modalities have been incorporated into the Lugano classification for NHL in adults, 
there are minimal data on its use in children with NHL.  
ALK negative (-) ALCL has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult ALCL. However, as 
the overwhelming majority of paediatric patients with ALCL are ALK positive (+), the prognostic 
significance of ALK-disease in childhood remains unclear. Histologic subtype has been shown to be 
associated with increased relapse risk in several studies.  
Management 
Current Therapies for Paediatric Patients with ALCL 
ALCL  is  a  chemosensitive  malignancy  both  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients,  and  multiple  combination 
therapies are used as first-line treatment in the US (NCCN 2018 Guidelines [a]), but no guidelines have 
yet been established in the EU.  In North America, patients with ALCL traditionally received less intensive 
but  prolonged  chemotherapy  without  high-dose  MTX  (Laver  et  al,  2005).    Most  European  paediatric 
groups and recent US-based regimens recommend treatment with short-pulse chemotherapy based on 
high-dose MTX, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and corticosteroids (Brugières 
et al, 1998; Le Deley et al, 2010; Lowe et al, 2009; Pillon et, al 2009; Reiter et al, 1994; Seidemann et 
al, 2001; Williams et al, 2002; ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier NCT01979536). In studies evaluating front-
line therapies in patients with ALCL, 5-year OS is reported to be 65-81% (Le Deley et al, 2008; Prokoph 
et al, 2018) and EFS or PFS at 5 years ranges from 59% to 75% (Massimino et al, 1995; Mori et al, 
2003; Sandlund et al, 1994; Seidemann et al, 2001; Williams et al, 2002).  As many as 35% of paediatric 
patients  with  ALCL  are  refractory  to  front-line  therapy  or  develop  recurrent  disease  (Brugières  et  al, 
2009).  Among the patients who develop recurrent disease, 5-year OS after first relapse decreases to 
57-69% (Woessmann et al, 2011; Brugières et al, 2000).  Furthermore, for paediatric patients whose 
disease relapses during first-line treatment, 5-year OS is only 25% (Woessmann et al, 2011).  
There  is  no  consensus  on  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  paediatric  ALCL.    Unlike  other 
lymphomas,  ALCL  is  usually  still  chemosensitive  at  relapse,  and  most  patients  can  achieve  a  second 
remission and undergo high-dose chemotherapy (Brugières et al, 2000).  Induction therapy (including 
with multiagent regimens such as CCNU, and Ara-C or vindesine, dexamethasone, Ara-C, and etoposide) 
followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic HSCT after a second CR is frequently 
used  for  treatment  of  relapsed  ALCL  (Bordon  et  al,  2005;  Brugières  et  al,  2000;  Cesaro  et  al,  2005; 
Chen et al, 2008; Deconinck et al, 2000; Mori et al, 2006; Woessmann et al, 2006).   
Patients with subsequent relapses can also obtain prolonged remission following the administration of 
single-agent  vinblastine.    Five-year  EFS  and  OS  rates  were  30%  and  65%,  respectively,  among  36 
relapsed patients in a French Society of Paediatric Oncology study treated with single-agent vinblastine 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 8/149 
 
 
 
(with or without steroids) (Brugières et al, 2009).  However, a proportion of patients will relapse again 
and will require further treatment (Brugières et al, 2009). 
After  achieving  a  second  remission,  many  patients  undergo  autologous  or  allogeneic  HSCT,  as  a 
“consolidation” strategy after chemotherapy.  
Although data are limited, allogeneic HSCT appears superior to autologous HSCT (Prokoph et al, 2018 
and Fukano et al, 2015).  Allogeneic HSCT is effective in patients with either chemoresistant disease or 
multiple  relapses,  with  5-year  EFS  of  approximately  75%  (Cesaro  et  al,  2005;  Mori  et  al,  2006; 
Woessmann et al, 2006; Fukano et al, 2015).  However, allogeneic HSCT is also associated with a high 
rate of toxicity and toxicity-related mortality (Chakraverty et al, 2011). 
Unmet Need for Paediatric Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Systemic ALK-positive ALCL 
Crizotinib is a first-in-class molecularly targeted therapy that acts as a small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, 
MET/HGFR, ROS1, and RON RTKs. Crizotinib represents a new treatment option for paediatric patients 
with ALK-positive relapsed or refractory ALCL, a molecularly defined subgroup that currently lacks any 
approved therapeutic agents. Given that most paediatric ALCL cases are ALK positive and that aberrant 
ALK activity, attributed to ALK gene rearrangement, is postulated to be the direct cause of pathogenesis 
for paediatric ALCL, ALK is an ideal target for treatment. Single-agent therapy with crizotinib, an ALK 
TKI,  is  a  potentially  important  therapeutic  option  for  patients  with  ALCL  resistant  or  refractory  to 
chemotherapy and patients who underwent several previous treatments followed by disease relapse. In 
these  patient  groups,  crizotinib  may  act  as  a  bridge  to  HSCT  (eg,  achieving  CR  in  patients  with 
chemoresistant disease) or may offer an alternative option to HSCT altogether. An alternative to HSCT 
could be a favourable option even for patients fit enough to undergo the procedure. Notably, crizotinib 
was added as a treatment option for second-line (or later) treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive 
ALCL, including patients intended or not intended to proceed to HSCT, in the most recent version of the 
NCCN treatment guidelines for ALCL (NCCN 2018 guidelines[a]). 
Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumour (IMT) 
fibrosarcoma;  and 
IMT  is  a  class  of  tumour  that  presents  a  characteristic  histological  picture  comprising  a  spindle  cell 
proliferation with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes (Souid 
et  al,  1993).    Originally  described  in  the  lung,  these  lesions  have  been  reported  in  various 
extrapulmonary sites in the thorax, retroperitoneal or pelvic region (Tang et al, 1990).As a result of the 
uncertain  etiology  of  IMT,  the  WHO  refers  to  6  synonyms  (plasma  cell  granuloma;  inflammatory 
myofibrohystiocytic proliferation; omental mesenteric myxoid hamartoma; inflammatory pseudotumour; 
inflammatory  myofibroblastic  sarcoma)  and  highlights  that 
inflammatory 
pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferations can be difficult to distinguish from IMTs (Coffin et al, 
2013).The identification of clonal genetic aberrations involving the ALK locus supports the etiology of a 
low grade mesenchymal neoplasm.  Approximately 50%-70% of IMTs are positive for ALK expression 
(Dalton et al, 2016; Höhne et al, 2015; Chun et al, 2005; Lawrence et al, 2000; Mossé et al, 2009).  The 
most common mechanism for aberrant ALK expression or activation involves structural rearrangements 
in  the  ALK  gene  leading  to  a  chimeric  fusion  protein,  which  is  predominately  detected  by 
immunohistochemistry(Cook  et  al,  2001)  with  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  or  next-generation 
sequencing also being used (Casanova et al, 2020). 
Current Therapies for Paediatric Patients with IMT 
IMTs  are  commonly  in  the  thorax,  retroperitoneal  or  pelvic  region,  and  are  considered  resistant  to 
conventional chemotherapy and radiation (Schoffski et al, 2018).  Surgical resection is the mainstay of 
treatment, but due to close proximity to vital structures, a complete surgical resection may not always 
be an option.  If curative surgery is not possible, local recurrence can occur with tumour invasion into 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 9/149 
 
 
 
adjacent structures. This invasion is most likely to have a fatal outcome for the patient, rather than the 
development of distant metastasis which is less common. 
Unmet Need for Paediatric Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Systemic ALK-positive IMT 
Treatment options are limited in cases of unresectable or advanced IMT (Schoffski et al, 2018). There 
are no approved therapies for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory IMT. However, as a 
mesenchymal tumour admixed with an inflammatory component, IMTs may respond initially to 
systemic corticosteroid therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Mattei and Barnaby, 2008). 
Alterations in ALK may contribute to the aggressive behaviour of some tumours (Chiarle et al, 2008; 
Coffin et al, 1998; Hagenstad et al, 2003). There is no standard therapy for aggressive unresectable 
tumours. Varying responses have been obtained with several chemotherapeutics including vincristine, 
methotrexate, etoposide, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine, 
although some of these tumours represented IMT with malignant transformation (Dishop et al, 2003; 
Favini et al, 2010; Hagenstad et al, 2003). Crizotinib represents a new treatment option for paediatric 
patients with ALK-positive IMT, a molecularly defined subgroup that currently lacks any approved 
therapeutic agents. In addition, the NCCN currently recommends crizotinib for the treatment of IMT 
with ALK rearrangements (NCCN 2018 Guidelines [b]) based on literature reports (Schoffski et al, 
2018). 
2.1.2 About the product 
Crizotinib is a first-in-class molecularly targeted therapy that acts as a small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, 
MET/HGFR, ROS1, and RON RTKs. Crizotinib received approval in the US for the treatment of patients 
with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is ALK- positive as detected by an FDA-approved 
test. Crizotinib also received approval in the EU for the treatment of adults with previously treated, and 
subsequently  for  previously  untreated,  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC.  Additional  approvals  for  the 
treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC have been granted in more than 90 countries worldwide. A 
second crizotinib indication for the treatment of ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC was approved in the US 
and  EU  in  March  2016  and  August  2016,  respectively,  with  additional  approvals  for  this  indication  in 
more than 75 countries worldwide. On 14 January 2021, crizotinib received approval in the US for the 
treatment of paediatric patients 1 year of age and older and young adults with relapsed or refractory, 
systemic  ALCL  that  is  ALK-  positive  and  on  14  July  2022  crizotinib  was  approved  in  the  US  for  the 
treatment of paediatric patients 1 year of age and older and young adults with unresectable, recurrent, 
or  refractory  (ALK)-positive  IMT.    Crizotinib  was  approved  in  Switzerland  on  17  May  2022  for  the 
treatment of paediatric patients (≥6 to <18 years) with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive ALCL 
and for the treatment of paediatric patients (≥6 to <18 years) with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory 
ALK-positive IMT. 
Molecular Biology and Early Clinical Activity 
ALK  was  originally  discovered  in  ALCL,  where  the  chromosome  translocation,  t(2;5)(p23:q35),  was 
observed (Morris et al, 1994; Shiota et al, 1994).  This translocation generates the NPM-ALK oncogenic 
fusion protein, in which the kinase domain of ALK is fused to the N-terminal portion of the NPM protein 
and accounts for ~70%–80% of all ALK-positive ALCL (Mossé et al, 2009).  A higher prevalence of NPM-
ALK (~90% of all ALK fusions observed) has been reported in paediatric ALCL specimens (Damm-Welk 
et al, 2009; Perkins et al, 2005; Mussolin et al, 2010).  The NPM-ALK fusion protein dimerizes and leads 
to ligand-independent, constitutive expression and activation of ALK and associated signalling pathways 
(STAT3,  AKT/PI3K,  RAS/ERK,  etc),  which  control  cell  proliferation,  survival,  cell  cycling,  DNA 
methylation, activation of microRNA and expression of transcription factors (Mossé et al, 2009; Palmer 
et al, 2009; Eyre et al, 2014; Werner et al, 2017; Ducray et al, 2019).  Other transforming ALK fusions, 
including TPM3-ALK, which appears to the be most common outside of NPM-ALK and the less prevalent 
TFG-, CLTC-, ATIC-, MHY9-, MSN-, AL017-   ALK fusions, have also been reported in ALCL (Armstrong

et al, 2004; Pulford et al, 2004; Damm-Welk et al, 2009; Hallberg et al, 2013; Holla et al, 2017; Ducray 
et al, 2019).  
In a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, 2 ALCL-derived cell lines (SU-DHL-
1 and Karpas-299, both containing NPM-ALK) were reported (McDermott et al, 2008) to be particularly 
sensitive  to  ALK  inhibitors,  including  crizotinib.  Crizotinib  demonstrated  dose-dependent  inhibition  of 
phosphorylation of ALK as well as inhibition of activation of downstream ALK signaling targets ERK 1/2 
(also known as MAPK 44/42), AKT, STAT3 and PLC-γ1 in these tumour cells, and induced apoptosis at 
clinically  achievable  doses  (Pfizer  Study  Report  PF-02341066-Pharm-001,  Pfizer  Study  Report  PF-
02341066_Pharm_002, Hamedani et al, 2014, Wang et al, 2019).  
In vivo data demonstrated antitumour efficacy of crizotinib, including marked cytoreductive antitumour 
activity, in tumour models implanted in athymic mice that expressed activated NPM-ALK, and complete 
regression  of  the tumour  was  observed  in  the  Karpas-299  model  at  a  dose  of  100  mg/kg  QD  (Pfizer 
Study Report PF-02341066-Pharm-001; Pfizer Study Report PF-02341066_Pharm_002). 
2.1.3 The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program for crizotinib as a treatment for paediatric patients with ALK-positive 
ALCL  or  ALK-positive  IMT  has  been  planned,  conducted,  and  analysed  in  accordance  with  relevant 
regulatory requirements and guidance.  Guidance for oncology drugs included the US FDA’s “Clinical Trial 
Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics” (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018), 
“Cancer  Drugs  and  Biological  Products  –  Clinical  Data  in  Marketing  Applications”  (US  Food  and  Drug 
Administration, 2001), and the EMA “Guidance on Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Product in Man” 
and relevant Appendix 1 (European Medicines Agency, 2019). Several meetings were held with FDA and 
EMA to discuss the clinical development program and regulatory submission plans for crizotinib for the 
treatment of paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT.   
2.1.4 General comments on compliance with GCP 
This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the 
Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all GCP Guidelines.  In addition, all local regulatory 
requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of study 
patients. 
2.2 Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, with the exception of a revised 
environmental risk assessment (ERA) - which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1 Introduction

to the treatment  
o  of  paediatric  patients  (age  ≥6  to  <18  years)  with  relapsed  or  refractory  systemic  anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) 
o  of paediatric patients (age ≥6 to <18 years) with, recurrent, or refractory anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) unresectable positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT).

2.2.3 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The calculated PEC in Phase I was greater than 0.01 µg/L which necessitated a Phase II assessment. 
The PEC/PNEC values for surface water, subsoil and microorganisms were less than 1. However, the Koc 
of the sludge was greater than 10,000, which required a more complete assessment of the terrestrial 
compartment. Since the log Kow was 3.88 at pH 9, an evaluation of the bioconcentration potential in 
fish was required. Phase II fish bioconcentration, chironomid, aerobic soil transformation, and terrestrial 
environmental toxicity studies (conducted on >3 different types) demonstrated no risk from crizotinib.  
The revised environmental risk assessment (ERA) performed for the present extension of indication to 
the treatment was sufficient. 
The proposed PI wording: "Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements." Is therefore sufficient. 
2.2.4 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of crizotinib.  
- Considering the above data, crizotinib should be used according to the precautions stated in the 
SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment.

o  Study ADVL0912 
Pharmacokinetics design:  
For  patients  enrolled  prior  to  Institutional  Review  Board(IRB)/Independent  Ethics  Committee 
(IEC)  approval  of  Protocol  Amendment  3C  (26  May  2011),  the  following  crizotinib 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling was conducted inPhase 1 (Part A) and Phase 2 (Part B and Part 
C): 
-  For C1D1, PK samples were collected at the following time points: predose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 
2, 4, 6, 8-10, and 22-26 hours after the morning dose for patients who weigh ≥10 kg, or predose 
(0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8-10, and 22-26 hours after the morning dose for patients who weigh <10 
kg. The evening dose was not administered on Day 1. In addition, PK samples were collected 
prior to dose between Days 5-8, Days 12-15, Days 19-22, and Days 26-29 in Cycle 1. 
For patients enrolled following IRB/IEC approval of Protocol Amendment 3C (26 May 2011), the 
following crizotinib PK sampling was conducted: 
o  On C1D1, samples were collected prior to the first dose of crizotinib. At steady state (between 
Cycle 1 Days 15 and 28), samples were collected at predose (12 hours after the last dose), 1, 
2, 4, and 6-8 hours after the morning dose for all patients on Part A. 
Additionally steady state samples at the same time points were also collected for patients in Part 
B or Part C who had obtained informed consent to participate in the PK evaluation. 
Crizotinib plasma PK parameters (as appropriate for patients with serial PK sample collection) 
were estimated for each patient from plasma concentration-time data using a Pfizer validated 
noncompartmental analysis application system (eNCA version.2.2.4). 
Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0 ng/mL for the PK analysis. 
Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis where possible. However, nominal 
times were used for PK parameter estimations in situations where the dosing time was missing; 
this included C1D1 for all patients and at steady state for 3 patients (1 patient on C1D16 and 2 
patients on C1D15, all at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level). Additionally, nominal times were used 
for 2 PK samples for 1 patient on C1D22 at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level; the actual collection 
time was missing for the 4- and 6-hour postdose PK samples. 
PK parameters evaluated in the study included: 
-  Single  dose  plasma  PK  parameters  of  maximum  observed  concentration  (Cmax),  dose 
normalized  maximum  observed  concentration  (Cmax,  dn),  time  of  maximum  observed 
concentration  (Tmax),  time  of  last  observed  concentration  (Tlast),  area  under  the  curve  of  last 
measurable  quantity  (AUClast),  and  dose  normalized  area  under  the  curve  of  last  measurable 
quantity (AUClast, dn) were determined for C1D1. 
- Steady state plasma PK parameters Cmax, Cmax, dn, Tmax, area under the plasma concentration-
time profile from time zero to time tau, the  dosing interval (tau=12 for BID dosing) (AUCtau), 
dose normalized area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to time tau 
(AUCtau, dn), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), lowest concentration prior to next administration of 
drug  (Ctrough),  and  dose  normalized  lowest  concentration  prior  to  next  administration  of  drug 
(Ctrough,  dn) were determined during Cycle 1. For the determination of AUCtau, the predose (0 
hour) concentration was also used as the 12 hour postdose concentration as they are expected 
to be similar at steady state.

Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
Different  formulations,  strengths  and  dosage  forms  of  crizotinib  were  used  to  support  the 
different phases of clinical development.  
PK-Results: 
Mean  plasma  crizotinib  concentration-time  profiles  following  the  administration  of  single  oral 
doses of 100 mg/m2 BID, 130 mg/m2 BID, 165 mg/m2 BID, and 215 mg/m2 BID are presented 
by dose levels for paediatric patients in Figure 1.  There were no postdose PK samples collected 
for the 280 mg/m2 BID and 365 mg/m2 BID dose levels on C1D1: 
Single dose crizotinib PK parameters by dose level are summarised for paediatric patients with 
any tumour type (ALCL, IMT) in Table 2. 
Plots  of  individual  and  geometric  mean  crizotinib  Cmax  values  for  patients  in  the  total  group 
(patients with ALCL, IMT, or Other Tumours) by dose level are presented in Figure 1 and Figure

With the limited number of patients at most dose levels and limitations of the collection schedule (only 
up to 24 hours postdose), high interpatient variability was observed in PK parameters on C1D1.  The 
plasma exposures of crizotinib across the dose levels largely overlapped.

Table 3 Summary of Plasma Crizotinib PK Parameters of Steady State by Tumor Type and Dose Level 
(All Tumor Types, All Dose Levels, Age <18 years), Study ADVL0912 Tumor Type: Total 
In order to explore the potential effect of age on plasma PK of crizotinib in paediatric patients, 
patients were divided into 4 groups according to their age at baseline (2-<6, 6-<12, 12-<18, 
and  18-≤21  years).    The  dose  normalized  crizotinib  plasma  exposure  parameters  Cmax,  dn and 
AUClast, dn on C1D1 and Cmax, dn and AUCtau, dn at steady state are summarised in Table 4 and Table 
5, respectively.  
Plots of dose normalized parameters by age group are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 (C1D1) 
and Figure 6 and Figure 7 (steady state).  In addition to the categories based on age defined 
above, an additional category with pooled data for all paediatric patients was also generated for 
relevant crizotinib PK parameters and included in the tables. 
Based  on  visual  examination  of  the  data,  on  C1D1  (single  dose),  crizotinib  dose  normalized 
exposure measures (AUClast, dn and Cmax, dn) appeared highest in the youngest paediatric patient 
group (2-<6 years) compared to the other age groups.  However, there was high interpatient 
variability in crizotinib PK parameters across the age groups. 
Assessment report

At steady state, a visual examination of the data indicated that mean crizotinib dose normalized 
exposure measures (AUCtau, dn and Cmax, dn) appeared to decrease with the increase in age from 
2-<6 years to 12-<18 years.  The dose normalized exposures were similar between patients who 
were  12-<18  years  and  patients  of  18-≤21  years,  which  were  comparable  with  the  dose 
normalized exposure from adult patients (Initial Crizotinib submission) largely overlapping. The 
individual values for patients of 18-≤21 years completely overlapped with those for paediatric 
patients.  Of  note,  the  steady-state  dose-normalized  exposures  for  patients  who  were  12-<18 
years were comparable to that observed for adult patients with cancer (Initial Crizotinib data).

o  Study A8081013 
Study Design 
Study A8081013 is a Phase 1b, open label, multicentre, single arm exploratory study evaluating 
the  antitumour  activity,  safety,  and  PK  of  crizotinib.  Patients  (≥15  years)  with  a  histologic  or 
cytologic proven diagnosis of ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC, eg, IMT, 
for  which  no  standard  therapy  was  available  and  were  positive  for  harboring  a  translocation, 
inversion, mutation or amplification event involving the ALK gene locus were enrolled. 
Patients  could  have  continued treatment  with  crizotinib  after  disease  progression if  there  was 
evidence of clinical benefit in the judgment of the Investigator. 
The study is still ongoing. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
All patients in this study received a crizotinib starting oral dose of 250 mg BID. Of the 5 paediatric 
patients enrolled in this study, 3 were in the ALCL group 2 were in the IMT group (A8081013 
CSR  Table  16.2.5.4.1.2).  The  mean  steady-state  Ctrough  values  for  these  paediatric  patients 
were comparable with the adult patients in this study (A8081013 CSR Tables 16.2.5.4.4.1 and 
16.2.5.4.4.2). 
  Population-PK analysis: 
Additionally to the NCA analysis of the data from from Study ADVL0912 and Study 
A8081013 a Report labelled: “Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Crizotinib (Xalkori) in Paediatric 
Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma” is provided by 
the MAH 
The objective of these investigations were: 
•  To  explore  the  potential  effect  of  age,  body  weight,  body  surface  area  (BSA),  and  tumour  type 
(anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour 
(IMT), and Other Tumour) on crizotinib plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in the paediatric population using 
observed  steady-state  trough  concentration  (Ctrough,ss)  and  steady-state  maximum  observed 
concentration (Cmax,ss), 
•  To  develop  a  predictive  population  pharmacokinetic  (popPK)  model  for  crizotinib  in  the  paediatric

• To derive individual crizotinib plasma PK exposure metrics for all patients included in the popPK analysis 
to support exposure-response (ER) safety and efficacy analyses if a popPK model is built. 
STUDY DATA OVERVIEW 
The present analysis used paediatric patient data from Study ADVL0912 and Study 
A8081013.  Only  data  from  paediatric  patients  (age  <18  years)  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
crizotinib and have at least one on-treatment PK sample collection were included in the analysis. 
All paediatric patients (age <18 years) in Study ADVL0912 and Study A8081013 who received at least 
one dose of crizotinib and had at least one post-dose drug plasma concentration available were included 
in  the  popPK  analysis.  A  popPK  dataset  was  created  by  the  Global  Biometrics  and  Data  Management 
(GBDM) group following Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs). The analysed database consisted 
in: dosing, plasma crizotinib concentrations, and various demographic and treatment information for a 
total  of  98  paediatric  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  crizotinib  and  had  at  least  one  on-
treatment  PK  sample;  93  patients  were  from  Study  ADVL0912  and  5  patients  were  from  Study 
A8081013.  In  total,  there  are  595  PK  records  with  measurable  crizotinib  concentration  for  paediatric 
patients. 
The observed data for categorical demographic variables and the number of patients assigned to each 
dose level are summarised in Table 6.

Figure 8 Distribution of Potential Covariates to be Tested in the Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
METHODS 
Covariate Analysis Using Observed Steady-State Concentrations 
Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss from Study ADVL0912 and Study A8081013 were analysed using linear models. Data 
processing  and  generation  of  tables  and  figures  was  conducted  using  R  version  3.6.1.  Linear  mixed 
effects  modeling  was  used  to  perform  the  covariate  analysis  on  crizotinib  plasma  PK.  Ctrough,ss  and 
Cmax,ss were separately evaluated as measures of crizotinib plasma exposure. Each model used dose-
normalized  exposures,  as  patients  received  doses  ranging  from  100  to  365  mg/m2.  Each  potential 
covariate effect was modeled independently of other potential covariates. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
PopPK modeling was performed using the NONMEM version 7.4.3 software (ICON 
Development  Solutions,  Ellicott  City,  MD).  Data  processing  and  generation  of  figures  and  tables  was 
performed  in  R  version  3.6.1  (R  Foundation  for  Statistical  Computing,  Vienna,  Austria).  Stochastic 
approximation expectation-maximization / Monte Carlo importance sampling (SAEM/IMP) was used.  
RESULTS: 
Covariate Analysis Using Observed Steady-State Concentrations 
Out  of  the  98  unique  patients  in  Study  ADVL0912  or  Study  A8081013  who  provided  post-dose  PK 
samples, 85 patients provided 132 Ctrough,ss and 56 patients provided 56 Cmax,ss. 
Age, body weight, and BSA met the statistical criteria of a<0.05 for both the Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss analyses, 
while  ALCL  tumour  type  met  the  statistical  criteria  of  a<0.05  for  the  Cmax,ss  analysis.  For  crizotinib 
Ctrough,ss, an increase of 1 year of age, 1 kg of body weight, and 0.1 mg/m2 of BSA resulted in a decrease 
of approximately 7.0%, 1.5%, and 7.5%, respectively. 
For crizotinib Cmax,ss, an increase of 1 year of age, 1 kg of body weight, and 0.1 mg/m2 of BSA resulted 
in a decrease of approximately 7.9%, 1.8%, and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with ALCL tumours had on 
average approximately 41.3% lower crizotinib Cmax,ss.

These evaluations of body size related covariates (age, body weight, and BSA) on crizotinib exposure 
and ALCL tumour type on crizotinib Cmax,ss are univariable analyses and do not adjust for other covariates. 
Crizotinib PK was evaluated using both 1-compartment and 2-compartment models. Allometric scaling 
of baseline body weight on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) 
were  explored  in  various  models,  with  CL/F  and  intercompartmental  clearance  (Q)  scaled  using  an 
exponent  of  0.75  and  Vc/F  and  apparent  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  (Vp/F)  scaled  using  an 
exponent of 1. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Crizotinib PK in paediatric patients was well characterized by a 1-compartment model with first order 
absorption and a lag time.  While crizotinib PK in adults was previously characterized by a 2-compartment 
popPK  model,  the  PK  sampling  scheme  and  sparse  PK  data  in  paediatric  patients  did  not  allow  for  a 
predictive 2-compartment to be built.  The estimated parameters of the base model are tabulated inTable 
7 below. 
Table 7 Base Model Parameter Estimates and Bootstrap 
The base model was then subjected to graphical examination (Etas versus covariate plots) and SCM to 
investigate whether there were covariates that influence crizotinib PK. The covariates tested in SCM are 
listed in Table 8.

In  backwards  elimination,  all  of  the  covariates  from  the  forward  selection  were  removed  using  the 
statistical criteria of a < 0.001. As a result, the final model was the same model as the base model.

Base Model Predictive Performance 
A VPC was performed using PsN with the base model. The results are displayed in Figure 10. The model 
performed  well  in  predicting  the observed  data,  with  5th,  50th,  and  95th  percentiles of  the  observed 
data  mostly  lying  within  the  90%  prediction  intervals  of  the  5th,  50th,  and  95th  percentiles  of  the

Conclusions: 
Based  on  the  covariate  analysis  using  observed  crizotinib  steady-state  plasma  concentrations 
and the popPK analysis: 
o  A 1-compartment first order plus lag time absorption model with body weight allometric scaling 
  and proportional error adequately characterized crizotinib PK in paediatric patients. 
o  Body weight (included through allometric scaling of model parameters) was the only meaningful 
covariate on crizotinib plasma PK in paediatric patients. Higher body weight was associated with 
higher apparent clearance and higher apparent central volume of distribution. 
o  While age, body surface area, and tumour type were associated with changes in plasma crizotinib 
exposure,  none  of  these  covariates  significantly  affected  crizotinib  PK  once  body  weight  was 
accounted for in paediatric patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022

o  Simulations of the recommended 280 mg/m2 BID crizotinib dosing regimen resulted in consistent 
plasma  exposures  for  paediatric  patients.  BSA-normalized  apparent  clearancewas  consistent 
across age groups and tumour types. 
  Exposure/Dose-Response Relationship: 
o  Analysis of Dose-Efficacy Relationship (Study ADVL0912 only): 
The analyses described below assessed the exposure and dose response relationships for efficacy 
endpoints, ie, ORR (including CR rate), DR and TTR, in paediatric patients receiving crizotinib 
treatment. 
Baseline characteristics, and measures for exposure and efficacy for patients with ALCL and IMT 
were summarised by descriptive statistics and graphical methods. Exposure (or dose) response 
analyses for objective response and complete response were conducted using logistic regression. 
TTR was treated as a continuous variable and analysed with a linear model. Baseline covariates 
were individually assessed. 
There were 22 ALCL and 12 IMT patients available for analysis of each efficacy endpoint. Due to 
the  limited  number  of  patients,  the  statistical  analysis  used  an  80%  confidence  level  for  all 
estimates.  With  a  lower  confidence  level  and  small  sample  size,  these  results  should  be 
interpreted with caution. 
For  ER  (with  any  observed  or  predicted  measures)  analysis,  no  important  relationships  were 
identified and the predicted ER relationships were not well characterized. 
The  only  important  dose-response  relationship  observed  was  for  average  daily  crizotinib  dose 
(mg/m2/day) and objective response which showed that the probability of response increased 
with increasing dose. 
For ORR, the response rate was high (> 80%) regardless of the crizotinib plasma exposure or 
dose, and was similar for ALCL and IMT patients. Complete response rates were similar across 
exposure and dose but was different based on tumour type. 
Analysis  of  Dose-Exposure  Safety  Relationship  (Studies  ADVL0912  and 
8081013): 
The  analyses  described  below  evaluated  the  ER  and  dose  response  for  crizotinib  for  selected 
safety endpoints in paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL, ALK-positive IMT, or other tumour 
types (N=110). 
The ER analysis for safety was based on treatment-related AEs observed in Studies ADVL0912 
and A8081013. The analysis included treatment-related AEs that had Grade 3 or higher severity 
and  occurred  in  more  than  2%  of  patients  or  other  selected  treatment-related  AEs  of  special 
interests.  The  safety  endpoints  described  in  this  report  were:  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related 
neutropenia Grade ≥3 treatment-related lymphopenia, Grade ≥3 treatment-related leukopenia, 
Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  anaemia,  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  elevated  transaminases, 
Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  Diarrhoea,  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  Vomiting,  any  grade 
treatment-related  vision  disorder,  any  grade  treatment-related  bradycardia,  dose  reductions, 
dosing  interruptions,  permanent  discontinuations  associated  with  any  AEs,  and  any  Grade  ≥3 
AEs. 
Crizotinib dosing metrics used in the analyses were planned starting dose level, average daily 
dose,  and  relative  daily  dose.  Average  steady-state  trough  concentration  (Ctrough,ss)  and 
steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax,ss) were the observed crizotinib exposure metrics 
evaluated in these analyses. Individual predicted crizotinib exposure metrics derived from the 
population  PK  model  based  on  empirical  Bayes  estimates  (EBE),  including,  steady-state  area 
under the curve (AUCss), Cmax,ss, area under the curve following the first dose from time 0 to 
12 hours (AUCsd), and maximum concentration following the first dose (Cmax,sd) were used for 
the predicted exposure-response analyses. 
Covariates in the exposure response analysis with safety endpoints included treatment duration, 
age, race, sex, body weight, height, BMI and BSA.

For safety endpoints with a sufficient number of events (ie, event rate ≥10%), logistic regression 
for binary data was used to model the response. The base statistical model included exposure 
(or dose) and tumour type. A separate intercept for each tumour type category, ie ALCL, IMT, 
and Other tumour types, was included in the model (equivalent to stratifying by tumour type) 
with a linear slope term for exposure (or dose). A full covariate model using logistic regression 
with relevant covariates was developed. A stepwise backward elimination procedure (with α = 
0.02) with the full model was used to determine potentially important covariates. Exposure (or 
dose)  and  tumour  type  were  kept  in  the  model  throughout  the  stepwise  process  and  in  final 
model.  For  the  final  model,  back-transformed  estimates  including  the  odds  ratios  for  the 
exposure (or dose) and covariate parameters, 95% CIs and p-values were presented. 
As a result of low event rates (<10%), the following safety endpoints were not modeled: Grade 
≥3  treatment-related  Diarrhoea,  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  Vomiting,  and  any  grade 
treatment-related bradycardia. In all models, tumour type was included a priori. For Grade ≥3 
treatment-related AEs of lymphopenia, leukopenia, elevated transaminases, and anaemia, the 
IMT tumour type could not be included in the model due to the lack of these AEs in this patient 
population. 
In the ER analysis for Grade ≥3 treatment-related neutropenia, for every unit increase in log of 
observed  crizotinib  Ctrough,ss,  the  odds  of  experiencing  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related 
neutropenia  increased  by  2.57  times  (95%  CI:  1.05,  6.84).  Similarly,  for  predicted  crizotinib 
exposure, for every unit of increase in log of predicted AUCss, the odds of experiencing Grade 
≥3 treatment-related neutropenia increased by 2.44 times (95% CI: 1.21, 5.49). Additionally, 
the patients with ALCL had higher odds of experiencing Grade ≥3 treatment-related neutropenia 
as  compared  to  patients  with  IMT.  No  dose  response  relationships  and  no  other  significant 
covariates  were  identified  for  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  neutropenia.  A  higher  rate  of 
treatment-related  neutropenia  is  not  unexpected  in  patients  with  ALCL  given  the  underlying 
involvement of the bone marrow and the prior use of cytotoxic chemotherapies. 
In the ER analysis, for every unit increase in log of observed crizotinib Ctrough,ss, the odds of 
experiencing  Grade  ≥3 treatment-related leukopenia  increased  by  3.14 times (95%  CI:  0.74, 
17.05). Similarly, for predicted crizotinib exposures, for every unit increase in log of predicted 
AUCsd,  the  odds  of  experiencing  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  LEUKOPENIA  increased  by  1.52 
times  (95%  CI:  0.68,  4.05).  The  CI  for  the  odds  ratios  were  wide  and  encompassed  1  for 
crizotinib exposures. Patients with other tumours had lower odds of experiencing an event as 
compared to patients with ALCL. In the dose response analysis, there appeared to be a shallow, 
inverse relationship of relative dose and Grade ≥3 treatment-related LEUKOPENIA, but the CI 
encompassed  1  and  is  not  considered  meaningful  [odds  ratio  0.95  (95%  CI:  0.90,  1.00)]. 
Additionally,  log  of  treatment  duration  also  exhibited  an  inverse  relationship  with  Grade  ≥3 
treatment-related LEUKOPENIA [odds ratio 0.53 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.88)]. It appeared that patients 
who  did  not  experience  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  LEUKOPENIA  were  able  to  receive  study 
treatment longer and relative dose closer to 100%. 
For every unit increase in log of crizotinib observed average Ctrough,ss, the odds of experiencing 
treatment-related VISION DISORDER increased by 3.75 times (odds ratio 3.75 [95% CI: 1.36, 
11.94]). For every unit increase in log of crizotinib predicted AUCss, the odds of experiencing 
treatment-related VISION DISORDER increased by 6.36 times (odds ratio 6.36 [95% CI: 1.93, 
24.69]). A small, positive dose response relationship was identified for treatment-related VISION 
DISORDER.  For  every  unit  increase  in  crizotinib  average  daily  dose,  the  odds  of  experiencing 
treatment-related  VISION  DISORDER  increased  by  1.004  times  (odds  ratio  1.004  [95%  CI: 
1.002,  1.007]).  In  the  final  ER  model  with observed  Ctrough,ss,  patients  with  ALCL  had  5.91 
times higher odds (95% CI: 1.05, 41.51) of experiencing treatment-related VISION DISORDER, 
compared  to  patients  with  IMT.  In  the  final  ER  model  with  predicted  AUCss,  log  of  crizotinib 
clearance (CL) and female sex were also identified as covariates. Female patients had 4.03 times 
higher  odds  (95%  CI:  1.44,  12.58)  of  experiencing  treatment-related  VISION  DISORDER  as 
compared to male patients. 
Crizotinib CL is correlated with age and various body size covariates, which may have confounded 
the  results.  Despite  the  ER  relationships  for  treatment-related  VISION  DISORDER,  in  Studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 35/149 
 
 
 
A8081013  and  ADVL0912,  all  treatment-related  VISION  DISORDER  were  Grade  1  or  2  in 
severity, and there were no events of Grade 3 or higher. 
An inverse relationship was identified with relative dose based on mg (%), where patients who 
received a crizotinib relative dose closer to 100% had lower odds of dosing interruptions (odds 
ratio  0.88  [95%  CI:  0.81,  0.93).  This  is  as  expected,  since  patients  who  had  more  dosing 
interruptions received fewer doses of crizotinib relative to their planned dosing schedule, which 
resulted  in  lower  relative  doses.  Log  of  treatment  duration  was  included  in  all  ER  and  dose 
response models and showed that patients with longer treatment duration had higher probability 
of dosing interruptions. 
No  ER  or  dose  response  relationships  were  identified  for  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related 
lymphopenia,  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  leukopenia,  Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  anaemia, 
Grade  ≥3  treatment-related  elevated  transaminases,  dose  reductions,  dosing  interruptions, 
permanent discontinuations due to any AEs, or any Grade ≥3 AEs. 
In all ER and dose response analyses in this report, the planned dose level of 280 mg/m2 BID 
was explored further graphically by categorizing patients in this dose level as receiving starting 
daily doses of ≤500 mg/day or >500 mg/day. The predicted probabilities for all safety endpoints 
were similar between starting daily doses of ≤500 mg/day or >500 mg/day. 
2.3.3 Pharmacodynamics 
The  analyses  described  below  assessed  the  exposure  and  dose  response  relationships  for  efficacy 
endpoints, ie, ORR (including CR rate), DR and TTR, in paediatric patients receiving crizotinib treatment. 
Baseline characteristics, and measures for exposure and efficacy for patients with ALCL and IMT were 
summarised by descriptive statistics and graphical methods.  Exposure (or dose) response analyses for 
objective response and complete response were conducted using logistic regression.  TTR was treated 
as  a  continuous  variable  and  analysed  with  a  linear  model.    Baseline  covariates  were  individually 
assessed.  
There were 22 ALCL and 12 IMT patients available for analysis of each efficacy endpoint.  Due to the 
limited number of patients, the statistical analysis used an 80% confidence level for all estimates.  With 
a lower confidence level and small sample size, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
For ER (with any observed or predicted measures) analysis, no important relationships were identified 
and the predicted ER relationships were not well characterized.   
The  only  important  dose-response  relationship  observed  was  for  average  daily  crizotinib  dose 
(mg/m2/day)  and  objective  response  which  showed  that  the  probability  of  response  increased  with 
increasing dose. 
For ORR, the response rate was high (> 80%) regardless of the crizotinib plasma exposure or dose, 
and was similar for ALCL and IMT patients.  Complete response rates were similar across exposure and 
dose but was different based on tumour type. 
2.3.4 Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The analyses submitted by the MAH assessed the exposure and dose response relationships for efficacy 
exploratory endpoints in paediatric patients receiving crizotinib. In Study ADVL0912, 22 ALCL and 12 
IMT patients were available for the assessment.  
Average daily dose based on mg/m2/day showed a positive dose-response relationship with ORRs. An 
additional dose-response analysis with objective and complete response in a subset of patients receiving 
a planned starting dose of 280 mg/m² BID was done. The first administered total daily dose was grouped 
as  ≤500  mg  v.s.  >500  mg  and  analysed  with  logistic  regression.  The  MAH  claims  that  no  objective 
response analysis was done due to limitations in the data. For complete response, patients receiving a 
first administered total daily dose ≤500 mg had a higher probability of response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 36/149 
 
 
 
For ORR, the response rate was high (>80%) regardless of the level of exposure or dose and were 
similar for ALCL and IMT patients. For ALCL at the median dose, the ORR is 91%. The ORR for IMT 
patients is estimated to be similar to that observed in ALCL patients at the median average daily dose. 
Complete response rates were similar across exposure and dose but were different based on tumour 
type.  
Average daily dose showed a positive dose-response relationship with objective response. However, 
the predicted probability curve showed that for patients with a higher doses, there was a lower 
predicted probability of experiencing a complete response. It is to be noted that the dose-response 
relationship with crizotinib is expected to be not very well estimated because of wide confidence bands. 
Indeed, the statistical analysis used an 80% confidence level for all assessments due to the limited 
number of enrolled patients. With a lower confidence level, and the small sample size, these results 
are difficult to interpret. 
The recommended dosage of crizotinib for paediatric patients with ALCL or IMT is 280 mg/m2 orally 
twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At this regimen, observed crizotinib 
predose concentration (Ctrough) at steady state is similar regardless of body weight quartiles. The 
observed mean Ctrough at steady state in paediatric patients at 280 mg/m2 twice daily is 482 ng/mL, 
while observed mean Ctrough at steady state in adult cancer patients at 250 mg twice daily across 
different clinical studies ranged from 263 to 316 ng/mL (see SmPC). 
No starting dose adjustment of crizotinib is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(either AST >ULN and total bilirubin ≤ULN or any AST and total bilirubin >ULN but ≤1.5 × ULN). The 
recommended starting dose of crizotinib in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and 
total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN and ≤3 × ULN) is the first dose reduction based on BSA as shown in Table 4 
of the SmPC. The recommended starting dose of crizotinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(any AST and total bilirubin >3 × ULN) is the second dose reduction based on BSA (see SmPC section 
4.2). No starting dose adjustment of crizotinib is recommended for patients with mild (60 < creatinine 
[CLcr] <90 mL/min) or moderate (30 ≤CLcr <60 mL/min) renal impairment calculated using the 
Schwartz equation. The recommended starting dose of crizotinib in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) not requiring dialysis is the second dose reduction based on BSA as 
shown in Table 4 of the SmPC. The dose may be increased to the first dose reduction based on BSA 
(see SmPC section 4.2) and on individual safety and tolerability after at least 4 weeks of treatment. 
2.3.5 Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical  pharmacology  analyses  submitted  are  considered  adequate.  Relevant  information  has  been 
included in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2. 
The following measures (category 3 studies, see RMP) are considered necessary to address issues related 
to clinical pharmacology:  
• 
The MAH will further assess the PK of crizotinib at the lower dose of 165 mg/m2 BID in paediatric 
patients enrolled at 280mg/m² BID and efficacy analysis performed in this setting.

Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing recommendations 
In Study ADVL0912, the MTD and RP2D were estimated to be 280 mg/m² BID and objective responses 
in ALK-positive ALCL and ALK positive IMT were observed in paediatric patients at doses of 165 mg/m² 
BID and 280 mg/m² BID.  To further evaluate the efficacy of the 280 mg/m² BID MTD dose relative to 
the  approved  adult  starting  dose  of  250  mg  BID,  additional  analyses  were  conducted  comparing 
paediatric patients who received a starting dose ≤ 250 mg BID versus those who received a starting 
dose > 250 mg BID.   
There were 16 patients in the ALCL group who received crizotinib at a starting dose of 280 mg/m² BID.  
Of these 16 patients, 3 received crizotinib at a starting dose of ≤ 250 mg BID and 13 received crizotinib 
at a starting dose of >250 mg BID.  In terms of efficacy, the ORRs were similar between the 2 subgroups, 
100%  (3/3;  95%  CI:  43.9,  100)  for  the  ≤  250  mg BID  subgroup  and 84.6% (11/13;  95%  CI:  57.8, 
95.7)  for  the  >250  mg  BID  subgroup.    Although  the  median  DR  was  longer  for  the  ≤  250  mg  BID 
subgroup than the >250 mg (14.1 months vs 1.2 months), no responders (0/3) in the ≤ 250 mg BID 
subgroup proceeded to HSCT; whereas, 8/11 responders in the > 250 mg BID proceeded to HSCT. For 
patients  with  ALK-positive  IMT  at  280mg/m2  BID,  ORRs  and  DRs  were  comparable  between  starting 
doses ≤250 mg BID (N=7) and starting doses > 250mg BID (N=5) (100% vs 80.0%, respectively, and 
12.7 months vs 11.4 months, respectively). 
2.4.2 Main study(ies) 
Study ADVL0912 
The primary study supporting the clinical antitumour activity in this application is the COG-sponsored 
Study  ADVL0912.    A  full  description  of  this  study  is  provided  in  the  Study  ADVL0912  Protocol,  and  a 
summary is provided below. 
Methods 
This was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicentre study of the evaluation of crizotinib in paediatric patients 
with relapsed or refractory solid tumours (including IMT) or with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-
positive ALCL (hereafter referred to as “patients with ALK-positive ALCL”). Phase 1 was a rolling-6, dose-
finding study of crizotinib to estimate the maximum dose that was safe and tolerable. During Phase 2, 
an expansion at the MTD  added 2 new parts of the  study (Parts B and C) which was made to obtain 
preliminary antitumour activity data in patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive NB or ALCL. In 
addition, patients with any ALK-activated or MET-activated tumour continued to be enrolled in Part A2. 
Paediatric  patients  (aged  >12  months  and  ≤21  years)  with  a  histologic  verification  of  malignancy  at 
original diagnosis or relapse were enrolled as follows: 
· Phase 1 (determination of MTD): 
· Part A1: Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumours (including IMT) or ALCL (excluding patients 
with primary or metastatic CNS tumours as of Protocol Amendment 3C [26 May 2011] or patients with 
primary cutaneous ALCL). 
·  Part  A2:  Patients  with  confirmed  ALK  fusion  proteins,  ALK  mutations,  ALK  amplification  (defined  as 
greater  than  4-fold  increase  in  the  ALK  signal  number  as  compared  to  reference  signal  number  on 
chromosome  2q  arm)  or  MET  mutation  or  amplification.  Patients  with  unresectable,  recurrent,  or 
refractory ALK-positive IMT (hereafter referred to as “patients with ALK-positive IMT”) could have also 
been enrolled during Part A2. 
· Part A3: Patients with relapsed or refractory NB, with or without bone marrow involvement, who are 
not eligible for Part A1 or A2 or could not have enrolled in Part A1 because of stratum suspension or lack 
of available slots. 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 38/149 
 
 
 
· Phase 2 (antitumour activity data): 
·  Part  A2:  Patients  with  diagnoses  other  than  NB  or  ALCL  with  confirmed  ALK  fusion  proteins,  ALK 
mutations,  ALK  amplification  (defined  as  greater  than  4-fold  increase  in  the  ALK  signal  number  as 
compared to reference signal number on chromosome 2q arm) or MET mutation or amplification. Patients 
with ALK-positive IMT could have also been enrolled during Part A2. 
· Part B: Patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive NB. 
· Part C: Patients with ALK-positive ALCL (excluding patients with primary cutaneous ALCL). A Simon’s 
optimal two stage design will be used. 
In  Phase  1,  patients  received  a  starting  dose  of  crizotinib  of  100  mg/m2  administered  orally  in  a 
continuous, BID dosing regimen. The dose was further escalated until the MTD was established. Patients 
in the initial Phase 2 expansion were treated at the recommended dose from the Phase 1 component of 
this study, which was 280 mg/m²BID. 
The study design is presented in Figure 14. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 2.5 for further 
details regarding the study design.

Response Criteria for Patients with ALCL 
1/ Complete Response: 
Disappearance of all evidence of disease from all sites for at least 4 weeks. This will be determined by 
PE  and  imaging.  Bone  marrow  aspirate/biopsy  must  be  normal  and  any  macroscopic  nodules  in  any 
organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present. PET scans must be negative if 
initially positive. 
2/ Complete Response Unconfirmed: 
A residual lymph node mass > 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by >75% in 
sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD), or any residual lesions in organs 
that have decreased by >75% and with a negative PET scan and SUV <3. Patients with only residual 
positive bone lesions on PET scans will be considered in CRu. Patients with bone involvement may have 
positive lesions o n P ET s cans f or sometime; therefore, these patients will be considered in CRu if the 
other  residual  lesions  have  disappeared,  or  of  the  residual  lymph  node  mass  or  masses  >1.5  cm  in 
greatest  transverse  diameter  have  regressed  by  >75%  in  sum  of  the  products  of  the  greatest 
perpendicular diameters (SPD).  
3/ Partial Response: 
≥50% decrease in the SPD of the lesions. No new lesions 
4/ No Response (Stable Disease): 
Failure to qualify for a PR. No new lesions.  
5/ Progressive disease: 
≥25% increase in the size of any lesions or appearance of new lesions. 
Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumours and Measurable Disease 
This study will use a minor modification of the (RECIST) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
from the NCI for assessment of radiographic response.  
1/ Measurable Disease: 
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the 
longest diameter at least 10 mm. The investigator will identify up to 10 measurable lesions to be followed 
for response. Previously irradiated lesions that have not demonstrated clear progression post radiation 
do not qualify as being measurable or evaluable. Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 43/149 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriate  imaging  modalities.  The  same  method  of  assessment  is  to  be  used  to  characterize  each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
2/ Quantification of Disease Burden 
The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the disease 
measurement. 
3/ End-of-Cycle Response 
a) Complete Response (CR) 
Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. If immunocytology is available, no disease must be 
detected by that methodology. 
b) Partial Response (PR) 
At  least  a  30%  decrease  in  the  disease  measurement,  taking  as  reference  the  disease  measurement 
done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment. 
c) Stable Disease (SD) 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for P D, taking as reference 
the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started. 
d) Progressive Disease (PD) 
At  least  a  20%  increase  in  the  disease  measurement,  taking  as  reference  the  smallest  disease 
measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or 
evidence of laboratory or clinical progression.  
Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumours and Evaluable Disease 
1/ Evaluable Disease 
The presence of at least one lesion that cannot be accurately measured in at least one dimension. Such 
lesions  may  be  evaluable  by  nuclear  medicine  techniques,  immunocytochemistry  techniques,  tumour 
markers or other reliable measures.  
2 /Complete Response (CR) 
Disappearance of all evaluable disease. 
3/ Partial response 
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease.  
4/ Stable Disease (SD) 
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Progressive Disease. 
5/ Progressive Disease (PD) 
The  appearance  of  one  or  more  new  lesions  or  evidence  of  laboratory,  clinical,  or  radiographic 
progression.  
Overall Best Response Assessment 
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of analysis of treatment 
effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statutes.

Treatments 
Patients received crizotinib BID on a continuous schedule in cycles of 28 days duration.  Crizotinib was 
given  orally  (as  capsules  or  OS)  and  may  have  been  administered  on  an  outpatient  basis.    A  dosing 
nomogram  was  used  to  minimize  inter  patient  variability.    Patients  were  instructed  to  take  their 
medication at approximately the same time each day and to not take more than the prescribed dose at 
any time.  The doses may have been taken with or without food or beverage.  If a dose was missed or 
forgotten, it could have been taken up to (but not greater than) 6 hours later to help prevent missed 
doses.  Drug doses were adjusted based on the BSA determined based on height and weight obtained 
within 1 week prior to the beginning of each cycle.

• For the 5 patients with objective tumour response at the 165 mg/m2 BID dose level, the median DR 
was 6.9 months (range:2.5 to 10.2 months). 
• For the 18 patients with objective tumour response at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level, the median DR 
was 3.0 months (range:0.0 to 18.6 months). 
However, DR was underestimated because 11 patients with objective tumour response underwent HSCT 
(2 at the 165 mg/m2 BID dose level and 9 at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level).

Time to Tumour Response 
ALCL Group  
For the 19 patients with objective tumour responses, the responses were rapid, with a median TTR of 
0.9 months (range: 0.8 to 2.1 months) across both dose levels corresponding to the approximate time 
of the first on-treatment tumour scan. 
• For the 5 patients with objective tumour response at the 165 mg/m² BID dose level, the median TTR 
was 0.9 months (range: 0.8 to 1.0 months). 
•For the 14 patients with objective tumour response at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level, the median TTR 
was 1.0 month (range: 0.8 to 2.1 months). 
TTR is plotted for paediatric patients in the ALCL group with objective tumour response in Figure 2 which

For the 12 patients with objective tumour responses, the responses were rapid, with a median TTR of 
1.0 month (range: 0.8 to 4.6 months) across all dose levels corresponding to the approximate time of 
the first on-treatment tumour scan. 
•The 1 patient at the 100 mg/m2 BID dose level did not have an objective tumour response. 
•The 1 patient at the 165 mg/m² BID dose level had an objective tumour response with a median TTR 
of 0.8 months. 
•For the 11 patients with objective tumour response at the 280 mg/m2 BID dose level, the median TTR 
was 1.0 month (range: 0.9 to 4.6 months). 
TTR is plotted for paediatric patients in the IMT group with objective tumour response in Figure 18 which

Supportive study(ies) 
Study A8081013 
The  supportive  study  providing  clinical  antitumour  activity  in  this  submission  is  the  Pfizer-sponsored 
Study  A8081013.    A  full  description  of  this  study  is  provided  in  the  Study  A8081013  Protocol,  and  a 
summary is provided below. 
Methods 
Study  A8081013  is  a  Phase  1b,  open-label,  multicentre,  single-arm  exploratory  study  evaluating  the 
antitumour activity, safety, and PK of crizotinib.  Patients (≥ 15 years) with a histologic or cytological 
proven  diagnosis  of  ALCL  or  other  advanced  malignancy  other  than  NSCLC,  e.g.  IMT,  for  which  no 
standard therapy was available and who were positive for harbouring a translocation, inversion, mutation 
or amplification event involving the ALK gene locus were enrolled.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
further described in Study A8081013 Protocol Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 
Patients could have continued treatment with crizotinib after disease progression if there was evidence 
of  clinical  benefit  in  the  judgment  of  the  Investigator.    This  study  is  ongoing  (data  cut-off  date:  03 
September 2019). 
Study population  
Main eligibility criteria: 
1- Age ≥ 15 years 
2-  Histologically  or  cytologically  proven  diagnosis  of  ALCL  or  other  advanced  malignancy  other  than 
NSCLC for whom no standard therapy is available 
3- Positive for translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus 
4- Positive for ALK amplification events 
5- Positive for ALK activating point mutations 
6- Solid tumours must be measurable per RECIST version 1.1, and lymphomas must be measurable per 
NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
7- ECOG performance status 0-3 
Main ineligibility criteria: 
1- Mutations of amplifications involving the c-Met gene but not the ALK gene 
2- Concurrent treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial 
3- Prior therapy specifically directed against ALK 
Sample size:  
The sample size for this study was determined empirically based on expected small numbers of patients 
in  the  population  of  interest.  It  was  anticipated  that  a  total  of  approximately  40  patients  were  to  be 
enrolled in this study. 
Objectives and endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 59/149 
 
 
 
 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ORR  based on RECIST  version  1.1  for  solid tumours  and  the  NCI 
International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for patients with ALCL or other NHL  (Cheson 
et al. 2007). 
Secondary endpoints were: 
- PFS, OS, DR 
- Estimated probability of survival at 6-months and 1 year. 
- Plasma concentrations of crizotinib, 
- Proportion of patients with each of the ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation, amplification). 
- Phosphorylation status of ALK in the tumour samples from surgery or biopsy pre- and post-treatment, 
when available. 
Safety: 
The  primary  safety  endpoint  was  type,  incidence,  severity,  seriousness  and  relationship  to  study 
medications of adverse events (AE) and any laboratory abnormalities. 
Treatments 
In the study, patients received crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg BID orally continuously. 
Dosing interruption and/or intrapatient dose reduction by 1 and if needed, 2 dose level(s) was allowed 
depending on the type and severity of toxicity encountered (Dose Level -1 was 200 mg BID; Dose Level 
-2 was 250 mg QD). 
Efficacy Analyses 
The  analysis  populations  (Table  29);  and  antitumour  activity  objectives,  endpoints,  evaluations,  and 
statistical analyses (Table 30) for paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL or ALK-positive IMT in Study 
A8081013 are summarised in this section.

The study population for all analyses will include patients enrolled in the study who receive at least one 
dose  of  crizotinib.  Data  summaries/listings  will  be  presented  overall  as  well  as  separately  for  ALCL 
patients and patients with other malignancies (by tumour type, as applicable). Data for patients who are 
enrolled in the study but are later found to not have an ALK genetic event will be presented separately. 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no confirmatory inferential analyses are planned, and no 
imputation  for  missing  data  will  be  done.  Descriptive  statistics  (such  as  means,  medians,  standard 
deviations  and  ranges  for  continuous  data  and  percentages  for  categorical  data)  will  be  used  to 
summarise  patient  characteristics,  treatment  administration,  efficacy,  safety,  molecular  medicine  and 
pharmacokinetic parameters. Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: 
The best response (CR, PR, SD or PD) per RECIST version 1.1, or the NCI International Response Criteria 
for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (2007) where applicable, will be summarised. The objective response rate 
(ORR)  will  also  be  summarised  along  with  the  corresponding  exact  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval 
calculated using a method based on the F distribution. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: 
Secondary, time to event endpoints (eg, PFS, OS), will be summarised descriptively using Kaplan-Meier 
methods and displayed graphically, where appropriate. 
Efficacy results 
Study participants 
Study A8081013 is ongoing and was conducted at 16 sites in 7 countries: USA (5), Japan (3), Republic 
of Korea (2), China (3), Italy (1), Taiwan (1) and Russian Federation (1).  
The study start date was 22 March 2011 (First Patient First Visit). 
The data cutoff date was 03 September 2019. 
The study report date is 28 February 2020. 
Overall Population 
As of the data cutoff date (03 September 2019), a total of 44 patients (17 in the ALCL group, 9 in the 
IMT group and 18 in the Other Tumours group) were assigned to receive study treatment. Among these, 
there were 3 paediatric patients in the ALCL group and 2 in the IMT group. 
Ten (58.8%) patients in the ALCL group, 5 (55.6%) patients in the IMT group and 1 (5.6%) patients in 
Other Tumours group, were still on treatment. 
Paediatric Population 
Four  paediatric  patients  were  still  on  treatment  (2  in  the  ALCL  group  and  2  in  the  IMT  group).  One 
paediatric patient in the ALCL group permanently discontinued from treatment due to global deterioration 
of health status.

Historical control  
ALCL 
There is no standard of care for the 25-35% of patients who develop recurrent disease (Brugières et al, 
2009).    Relapsed  ALCL  is  traditionally  chemosensitive,  with  a  30-83%  rate  of  achieving  a  second 
remission  (Woessmann  et  al,  2011).    However,  multiple  relapses  are  not  uncommon,  with  40%  of 
patients able to achieve a second CR reported to have subsequent relapse(s) (Brugières et al, 2000).  
Current treatment options for paediatric patients in the relapsed or refractory setting include aggressive 
intravenous salvage therapies such as vinblastine, high-dose therapies (including total body irradiation, 
etoposide,  cyclophosphamide,  busulfan,  carmustine,  melphalan,  and/or  cytarabine)  followed  by 
autologous HSCT or allogeneic stem HSCT, but not all patients are expected to benefit from these current 
options.  HSCT is limited to those fit enough to undergo the procedure and who have an eligible donor.  
Furthermore, studies evaluating HSCT for relapsed or refractory ALCL showed some patient groups are 
less likely to benefit from the procedures (eg, patients with refractory disease or those unable to achieve 
a second, or later, CR in advance of HSCT) (Woessmann et al, 2006; Gross et al, 2010).  Furthermore, 
all current therapies are associated with significant toxicity (Brugières et al, 2009; Woessmann et al, 
2006; Woessmann et al, 2011; Harriset al, 2011).  In paediatric populations, 100-day transplant-related 
mortality  rates  between  14%  and  17%  have  been  reported,  and  the  transplant  complication  of 
venoocclusive liver disease has been reported to occur in up to 40% of paediatric patients (Gross et al, 
2010; Miano et al, 2008).  Secondary malignancies have been documented in paediatric ALCL following 
multiagent chemotherapy, with an expected increasing potential risk in the setting of multiple relapses 
and use of radiotherapy (Cairo and Perkins, 2012).  While vinblastine offers the potential for efficacious 
single-agent therapy for recurrent disease, long-term remission is expected to be most likely with long 
treatment  durations  (2  years  or  more)  (Brugières  et  al,  2009).    Toxicities  associated  with  vinblastine 
therapy  include  permanent  effects  such  as  hearing  loss  and  dyspnea  requiring  chronic  therapy 
(vinblastine sulfate USPI).  
Brentuximab  vedotin,  an  ADC  directed  against  CD30  protein,  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adults 
with systemic ALCL after failure of at least 1 prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen and is currently 
under investigation in paediatric patients (ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier NCT01492088).  In this study, 17 
paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL received brentuximab vedotin IV once every 21 days 
for  up  to  16  cycles.    For  the  17  paediatric  patients,  the  ORR  was  53%  and  the  median  EFS  was  4.8 
months (Locatelli et al, 2018).  
Collectively,  the  ORR,  CR  rate,  and  the  durability  of  responses  reported  for  Study  ADVL0912  (N=22 
paediatric patients) demonstrate improvement in antitumour effect over current available therapies for 
paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL.  At a starting dose of 280mg/m2BID, an ORR of 
87.5% and CR rate of 75.0%, by independent central radiological review, were reported.  While there 
are no approved therapies or established standard-of-care treatment of relapsed or refractory paediatric 
ALCL,  ORRs  of  approximately  30-83%and  53-83%  are  reported  for  currently  used  multiagent 
chemotherapy and monotherapy regimens, respectively (Brugières et al, 2009; Woessmann et al, 2011; 
Locatelli et al, 2018). 
In Study ADVL0912, median DR was 3.6 months (range: 0.0 -15.0 months) for the 19 responders across 
both dose levels. However, 52.6% of the patients proceeded to transplant after the occurrence of an 
objective response, resulting in a shorter median DR (1.5 months), as DR was censored at the time of 
last tumour assessment prior to transplant.  A longer median DR (9.2 months) was observed for patients 
with  ALK-  positive  ALCL  who  did  not  receive  a  transplant.    Still  taking  this  into  account,  crizotinib 
treatment was associated with durable tumour responses. 
As shown in Study ADVL0912 by the 10 patients with objective response who went on to receive HSCT, 
crizotinib  may  act  as  a  bridge  to  HSCT  or  may  offer  an  alternative  option  to  HSCT  altogether.  An 
alternative to HSCT could be a favourable option even for patients fit enough to undergo the procedure.  
In  paediatric  patients,  a  clear  benefit  for  HSCT  has  not  been  consistently  shown  across  the  limited 
available studies (Brugières et al, 2000).   
Assessment report

Furthermore, unlike all other current therapies, crizotinib offers the advantage of oral administration, 
eliminating  the  risks  of  infusion-related  reactions/injection  site  effects  and  providing  increased 
convenience/quality  of  life  for  patients  and  their  families.    Based  on  a  literature  review  of  studies 
reporting route of treatment administration preferences among patients with cancer, there was a general 
patient preference for oral versus IV administration; the ability to receive treatment at home was a main 
factor  for  this  preference  (Eek  et  al,  2016).    The  convenience  of  oral  therapy  administration  is  also 
preferred by paediatric caregivers.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that treatment at home can be 
beneficial  to  patients  with  cancer  (Stevens  et  al,  2006;  Crisp  et  al,  2014;  Delgado  et  al,  2009; 
Mandhaniya  et  al,  2011).    Benefits  for  paediatric  patients  can  include  increased  time  for  play,  study, 
improved school attendance, and more participation in normal activities (Stevens et al, 2006). 
IMT 
Given  the  rarity  of  IMT  tumours  in  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  fact  that  that  the  mainstay  of 
primary  therapy  has  been  complete  surgical  resection,  there  are  few  prospective  studies  and  limited 
published data on outcomes after systemic therapy beyond case reports. 
The largest series of paediatric patients with IMT reported to date is from the European Paediatric Soft 
Tissue  Sarcoma  Study  Group  who  recently  published  data  on  60 paediatric  patients  with  IMT  treated 
between  2005-2016  (Casanova  et  al,  2020).    Forty  (66.7%)  of  the  60  patients  were  ALK  positive 
(detected by IHC in 14 cases, by FISH only in 1, and by both in 25), and 20 were ALK negative.  In 
28/60 cases, systemic therapy was administered (19 cases as part of first-line treatment, and 9 cases 
as second-line treatment).  Overall response (CR + PR) to front- or second-line therapy was 63% (12/19 
patients)  and  66%  (6/9  patients),  respectively.    In  patients  receiving  systemic  first-  or  second-line 
therapies, 8/10 cases responded to vinblastine-methotrexate chemotherapy and 5/5 cases responded to 
ALK-inhibitors (these cases of IMT were ALK positive).  The median duration of response was not reported 
in  this  publication.    For  all  60  patients,  the  5-year  EFS  and  OS  were  82.9%  and  98.1%,  respectively 
(median  follow-up  of  59  months).    In  a  univariate  analysis  for  EFS,  none  of  the  variables  analysed 
correlated with outcomes, including gender, age at diagnosis (< 10 vs ≥10 years), site of disease (head-
neck, vs. abdomen, vs. chest), ALK status, tumour invasiveness, size of the primary tumour (≤ 5 cm vs 
>5 cm), loco-   regional lymph node involvement, or IRS staging group. 
Table 33 Systemic treatment given as first or second line Therapy and response (Casanova et al, 
2020) 
The  outcomes  reported  in  this  series  are  comparable  to  what  has  been  published  by  the  German 
cooperative  Weichteilsarkom  Studiengruppe  (Kube  et  al,  2018),  consisting  of  38  paediatric  patients 
treated between 2000 and 2014, with reported 5-year EFS and OS rates of 74% and 91%, respectively.

n=2 
with 
vincristine/dactinomycin/ifosfamide/doxorubicin; 
In  this  series,  18  patients  initially  received  systemic  therapy,  most  frequently  consisting  of  alkylator-
based  regimens  (n=11).    Objective  responses  were  observed  after  primary  systemic  therapy  in  5/18 
patients: 
with 
ifosfamide/vincristine/dactinomycin;  n=1  with  methotrexate/vinblastine/dexamethasone/  ibuprofen; 
and,  n=1  with  cefaclor.    Because  of  the  treatment  period  summarised  in  this  publication  took  place 
mainly before the approval of ALK inhibitors, only 1 patient received treatment with crizotinib (starting 
dose  not  provided).    This  patient  initially  received  previous  systemic  therapy  regimens  consisting  of 
methotrexate/vinblastine/dexamethasone  and  vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide  /ibuprofen/ 
methylprednisolone, and then achieved a response with crizotinib.  In this series, 3 patients had recurrent 
IMT; all 3 received regimens consisting of vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide that led to tumour 
shrinkage, although only 1 of these patients achieved a CR and 2 were alive with disease 2.1 and 3.4 
years following treatment. 
n=1 
In another series of 20 adult and paediatric patients (age range: 5-77 years) with IMT (ALK-positive= 
12, under assessment = 8). Thirteen patients (65%) received systemic treatment with an anthracycline-
based regimen, and 7 (35%) received methotrexate and vinorelbine/vinblastine (Baldiet al, 2019).  In 
12 evaluable patients, responses were as follows: 1 CR (8%), 6 PR (50%), 2 stable disease (17%), 3 
PD (25%), for an ORR = 58%.  
While the findings summarised above support a benefit for chemotherapy in unresectable, recurrent, or 
refractory  IMT,  the  authors  also  point  to  a  benefit  for  crizotinib  and  other  targeted  therapies  as  the 
tumour  responses  observed  with  ALK  inhibitors,  specifically  crizotinib,  are  comparable  or  superior  to 
what has been observed with chemotherapy and other systemic treatments.  
Collectively,  the  ORR,  CR  rate,  and  the  durability  of  responses  reported  in  Study  ADVL0912  (N=14 
paediatric patients) demonstrate improvement in antitumour activity over available systemic therapies 
for paediatric patients with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory IMT. ORR for paediatric patients with 
ALK- positive IMT was 85.7% (95% CI: 60.1, 96.0) across all dose levels, with an ORR of 91.7% (95% 
CI: 64.6, 98.5) at 280mg/m2BID (N=12).  CRs were observed in 35.7% (5/14) across dose levels, with 
CR observed in 41.7% (5/12) of patients treated at 280mg/m2BID.  For the 12 objective responses, the 
responses were rapid, with a median TTR of 1.0 month corresponding to the approximate time of the 
first on-treatment tumour scan.   
Additionally, objective responses were durable, with a median DR of 14.8 months (range: 2.8 to 48.9 
months) for the 12 responders.  Of note, the published results from Study ADVL0912, along with the 
data from the EORTC CREATE study, prompted the US NCCN to recommend the use of crizotinib as the 
standard  of  care  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  ALK-positive  IMT  in  their  2018  clinical  practice 
guidelines (NCCN 2018 Guidelines[b]). 
2.4.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Crizotinib is a first-in-class inhibitor of ALK, MET/HGFR, ROS1, and RON RTKs which received approval 
for the treatment of patients with NSCLC in EU and recently in the US for the treatment of paediatric 
patients 1 year of age and older and young adults with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive-
ALCL and in unresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT. 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the original indication for crizotinib to include treatment of 
paediatric patients (age ≥ 6 to < 18 years) with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and with unresectable, recurrent, or 
refractory ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy data are mainly based on these 2 non-comparative studies. Study ADVL0912 was a phase I/II 
trial  with  a  dose-escalation  part  and  a  dose  expansion  part.  Efficacy  population  of  study  ADVL0912 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 67/149 
 
 
 
includes 22 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 14 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT. 
Study A8081013 is a supportive ongoing phase Ib trial in which 3 paediatric patients with ALK-positive 
ALCL and 2 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT were included. 
It is acknowledged that a randomisation trial in this paediatric population would be difficult and that it 
would be difficult to enrol enough subjects in these rare populations to fully power a randomised trial. 
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  only  descriptive  data  are  provided  which  could  not  convincingly 
demonstrate improvement of the efficacy of crizotinib over existing treatments. In view of the unmet 
medical need in targeted paediatric setting, the combined phase 1/2 study design is anyway considered 
appropriate to establish a recommended dose to test by the phase 1 part and to detect the evidence of 
antitumour activity of single agent crizotinib in the phase 2 part of this open label single-arm study. The 
data obtained from historical comparator studies for other available treatments could serve to assist with 
the  interpretation  and  further  support  the  relevance  of  efficacy  data  from  the  submitted  single-arm 
studies, rather than demonstrate the superior efficacy of crizotinib over a comparator group in paediatric 
population.  
Pivotal Study ADVL0912 was a phase I/II trial with a dose-escalation part and a dose expansion part. 
Primary endpoints were established to estimate the MTD and the RP2D administered orally twice daily 
to  children  with  relapsed/refractory  solid  tumours  and  ALCL  and  to  define  the  toxicities  and 
pharmacokinetics of crizotinib. 
Efficacy was assessed as part of secondary endpoints, which included objective response (CR, CRu or 
PR),  duration  of  response  (DR)  and  time  to  tumour  response  (TTR).  Disease  response  was  assessed 
using RECIST criteria for solid tumours, the International Working Group (IWG1) response criteria for 
ALCL  and  the  revised  Cheson  criteria  for  response  assessment.  Efficacy  assessments  and  antitumour 
activity  were  only  considered  as  secondary  endpoints  in  this  study.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  secondary 
endpoints are usually not considered to be sufficient to influence B/R assessment, however, results from 
the  two  submitted  studies,  based  on  the  secondary  endpoints,  are  considered  clinically  meaningful. 
Efficacy endpoints were analysed in all patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib with measurable 
or evaluable disease at baseline by Investigator assessment or per central review. 
Study  A8081013,  is  an  ongoing  supportive  study  aiming  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  PK  of 
crizotinib  in  patients  whose  tumours  were  found  to  have  a  translocation,  mutation,  or  amplification 
involving the ALK gene locus, in tumour types other than NSCLC.  
This  study  is  also  part  of  the  PIP  that  has  been  agreed  for  crizotinib  with  the  PDCO  in  2019  for  the 
treatment of ALCL and treatment of IMT.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efforts made by the MAH in order to collect and analyse the audit findings are acknowledged.  It 
should be noted that the findings are more qualifying to "deficiencies" than protocol deviations that can 
be collected in a more standardized trial. Four Major disease outcome/Response Deficiency deviations 
that could impact the efficacy results analysis were reported. When looking into the details of these 
deficiencies within the annex provided by the MAH, it seems that only one major deficiency could have 
an impact since the CT scan done for one patient  reports measurable lesions when only non-
measurable disease is reported for this patient. The 3 other major deficiencies concern the absence of 
signature of the spreadsheet of disease response by the investigator, a dose interruption due to scan 
delays and the change of imaging method during the study for one patient. In one hand and since the 
search for such information was done retrospectively, the MAH states that it has been done "to the 
extent possible", which can lead to some bias in the analysis. On the other hand, when assessing the 
detailed list of major deviations provided in appendix with a potential impact on efficacy, which was 
the major concern for discussion, none of the deviations appear to question study results’ reliability.

Two starting doses were evaluated: 165 mg/m² BID and 280 mg/m² BID.  A total of the 22 paediatric 
patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib were enrolled in ALCL Group, from which 20 patients 
had discontinued from study and 2 were on treatment at the date of study closure and were switched 
to commercial supplies. Around 20% of patients discontinued treatment after physician decision or 
refusal of further protocol therapy. The MAH couldn’t detail the reasons of treatment discontinuation 
upon physician decision since the study was not designed to collect such details.  
Fourteen paediatric patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib were enrolled in IMT Group, from 
which 11 had discontinued from the study and 3 were on treatment at the date of study closure. The 
most frequent reasons for discontinuation were adverse event and physician decision. Overall, patients 
had a median age of 11 years (from 3 to 16 years, patients over 21 years old excluded from this 
analyses) and 86.4% of them had measurable disease at baseline. All patients had received prior 
therapies, as per inclusion criteria. The most frequently reported prior therapies were multi-agent 
chemotherapy (22 patients in the ALCL group, 100%), surgery, and radiation. No satisfactory 
responses were provided regarding censoring rules. These latter couldn’t be implemented for the 
pivotal study ADVL0912 with no sensitivity nor supportive applicable analyses.  
Given the design of the study and the low number of patients enrolled, it is hard to draw clear 
conclusions from a statistical point of view, however, efficacy results are quite outstanding:  
ORR: 
The ORR for the 22 enrolled ALCL patients was 86.4% (95% CI: 66.7, 95.3) for both dose level groups 
(6 patients received 165 mg/m² BID with an ORR of 83.3% and 16 patients received 280 mg/m² BID 
and achieved an ORR of 87.5%). 
The ORR for the 14 patients in the IMT group was 85.7% (95%CI: 60.1, 96.0) across all dose levels; 1 
patient enrolled at the 100 mg/m2 BID dose level and did not have an objective response, 1 patient 
enrolled at 165 mg/m² BID and had an objective response, and 12 patients enrolled at 280 mg/m² 
BID and had an ORR of 91.7%. 
CR: 
CRs were quite high across study groups and observed in 77.3% (17/22) of patients in the ALCL group 
across both dose levels, and in 83.3% (5/6) and 75.0% (12/16) of patients at the 165 mg/m² BID and 
280 mg/m² BID dose levels, respectively.  
In the IMT group, CRs were observed in 35.7% (5/14) of paediatric patients across dose levels. No 
patient at 100 mg/m2 BID and 165 mg/m² BID dose levels had a CR; at the 280 mg/m² BID dose 
level, CRs were observed in 41.7% (5/12) of patients. 
ORR and CR results remained stable across all age groups, despite the absence of patients under the 
age of 3, also including ALCL patients between 18 and 21.  
These results are very encouraging despite the small number of patients enrolled. It is to be noted that 
100% of patients between 18 and 21 years-old treated with crizotinib for ALCL achieved CR. 
DR: 
The median DR was 3.6 months (range: 0.0 to 15.0 months) for the responders across both dose 
levels in the ALCL group; 5 patients with objective tumour response at the 165 mg/m² BID dose level 
had a median DR of 6.9 months and 14 patients with objective tumour response at the 280 mg/m² 
BID dose level had a median DR of 2 months. The DR is quite underestimated here because of the 10 
patients who proceeded to HSCT after completing objective response (2 at the 165 mg/m² BID dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 69/149 
 
 
 
level and 8 at the 280 mg/m² BID dose level). A longer median DR (9.2 months) is noted for ALCL 
patients who did not receive a HSCT.  
DR for patients with IMT were more durable, with a median DR of 14.8 months (range: 2.8 to 48.9 
months) for the 12 responders. Eight of the 11 enrolled patients in the 280 mg/m² BID completed the 
study without any event. 
TR: 
Rapid responses were observed in the ALCL group with a median time to response (TTR) of 0.9 months 
(0.8 to 2.1 months) across both dose levels. Median TTR was comparable between the 165 mg/m² BID 
and the 280 mg/m² BID dose level groups (0.9 months and 1 month, respectively).  
Some patients in the ALCL group have quickly been in CR but did not receive HSCT before 20 months 
of treatment. Reasons for not receiving HSCT are not clear. Moreover, it is unclear for how long the 
patients were followed before censoring occurred in the IMT group. The MAH was asked to provide 
post-transplant efficacy and safety data, 100-day mortality and GvHD rates and is mainly stating that 
no such requested data could be provided since the pivotal study was completed 10 years ago when 
standards and clinical practices were much different and that no guidance was planned for proceeding 
to HSCT within the protocols. No such data were thus collected, which also applies for patients for 
whom crizotinib was used as a bridge to HSCT. From the supportive study A8081013, very scarce data 
were available  
For IMT group, the responses were also quite rapid and comparable to those observed in ALCL group, 
with a median TTR of 1 month (0.8 to 4.6 months) across the two dose levels. 
Dosing recommendations: 
In both dose levels, crizotinib presents similar efficacy results. Meanwhile, data at 280 mg/m² BID are 
more robust considering the larger number of enrolled patients (most patients with ALCL (16 of 22) 
and most patients with IMT (12 of 14) were treated at 280 mg/m² BID). Moreover, due to the 
paediatric-inadequate dosage form, dose adjustments below 200 mg are not possible and the 280 
mg/m² BID dose is allowing dose reduction recommendations. These results should be interpreted with 
caution since the number of patients in each of the groups is small and would be sensitive to shifts in 
the data.  
Moreover, two different formulations were used within the submitted studies including the oral solution 
which is not available on the market but were determined as bioequivalent during product 
development. An efficacy analysis by formulation was also provided but no clear conclusions regarding 
formulation-effect could be drawn for efficacy parameters compared to the previously assessed pooled 
data considering the very limited number of patients especially for the oral solution group (6 each in 
the ALCL and the IMT group). Overall, 7 patients switched formulations during the study with 1 patient 
switching from capsules to liquid. No reasons for the reported switches were provided by the MAH 
stressing that these information were not collected within the CRF. The MAH though confirmed that a 
paediatric microsphere encapsulated formulation is under development with 3 strengths: 20 mg, 50 
mg, and 150 mg and a type 2 variation is planned for Q2 2023 in order to seek the line extension.  
Patients with CNS involvement were not eligible in the submitted studies. CNS involvement are rare in 
children and adolescents with ALK+ ALCL and since there is no evidence of anti-leukemic activity of 
crizotinib in the excluded population of patients with CNS involvement/tumours/metastases, the MAH 
was asked to add a paragraph in section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to appropriately reflect this 
exclusion criteria which has been provided and the issue is then solved.  
Supportive study   
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 70/149 
 
 
 
A8081013 study enrolled a total of 5 paediatric patients (3 with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-
positive ALCL and 2 with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT) as of the data cut-off 
date of 03 September 2019. Paediatric patients represent ~ 11.4% (5/44) of the population enrolled in 
this study.  
Given the inclusion criteria, the paediatric population is represented by adolescents, among the 3 
patients with ALK-positive ALCL, 2 were males aged 15 years and 1 was female aged 16 years. Two 
patients with ALK-positive IMT were also enrolled, one was a 16 years old male and the other one was 
a 17 years old female patient.  
At time of date cut-off, all patients (but one treated for IMT) received at least one prior therapy. For 
the 3 ALCL patients, median duration of treatment was 77.1 months (range: 2.9 to 77.7 months) and 
dosing interruption was reported in one patient after a dose reduction from 250 mg BID to 200 mg 
BID. The durations of treatment for the 2 IMT patients were 75.7 months and 76.3 months. 
Of the 2 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT in Study A8081013, one patient achieved a PR (DR: 
69 months, PFS: 70.4 months) and 1 patient had a best overall response of stable disease with a PFS 
of 51 months at data cut-off date. Both patients were still on treatment as of the data cut-off date. Of 
the 3 patients enrolled with ALCL, two patients had objective responses with one patient having a CR 
(DR: 31.2 months, PFS: 32 months) while the second had a PR (27.6 months, PFS: 28.8 months).  
Both patients were still on treatment at data cut-off date while the third patient had a best overall 
response of stable disease with a PFS of 2.8 months. 
Efficacy data from this supportive study do not allow to draw robust conclusions for efficacy given the 
limitations in study design (even though it includes OS and PFS as secondary endpoints) and the 
limited number of paediatric patients enrolled. This being said, efficacy results from Study A8081013 
are consistent and supportive of those reported within the pivotal study. 
Historical Control: 
The MAH provided a short literature review of alternative treatment options in paediatric R/R ALCL and 
IMT. Despite the absence of comparability due to study design, this is informative. 
Complex high-dose therapies associations including irradiation, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, 
busulfan, carmustine, melphalan, cytarabine and vinblastine followed by HSCT are currently used for 
paediatric patients in the R/R ALCL setting with significant toxicities considering the targeted 
population.  
There is no standard of care regimen for the treatment of R/R paediatric ALCL and ORRs are of 
approximately 30-83% for currently used multiagent chemotherapy and 53-83% for monotherapy 
regimens (brentuximab and vinblastrine).  
For ALCL patients, the MAH elaborates on the results from the French AcSé program. Since Crizotinib 
has shown significant clinical activity in relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL in small cohorts of patients and 
in order to avoid a generalized off-label use and allow for an equal and nationwide access to crizotinib, 
the French National Cancer Institute (INCa, state organization) launched the AcSé program in patients 
aged 1 year and older with advanced ALK+ ALCL. Median age was 21 years and the median number of 
prior chemotherapy lines was 2 including brentuximab in 66% of patients. Among the 15 evaluable 
patients, 10 achieved an OR (67%, 95% CI [42%-85%]) (9CR, 1PR) and 5 experienced a disease 
progression. The response rate was similar in paediatric patients (67%, 95% CI [24%, 94%]) and in 
adults (6/9, 67%, 95% CI [31%, 91%]) and with a median follow-up of 12 months, the median PFS 
was 11.6 months (95% CI [1.41, NA]). A compassionate use program where Crizotinib was 
administered as monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients who were resistant/refractory to 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 71/149 
 
 
 
cytotoxic therapy also pointed out very encouraging results as the ORR was of 90.9%; (95% CI = 
58.7% to 99.8%). 
All these results are in line with the ADVL0912 pivotal study findings where the ORR for the 22 enrolled 
ALCL patients was 86.4% (95% CI: 66.7, 95.3) for both dose level groups with high CR rates. It 
should be noted that 100% of patients between 18 and 21 years-old treated with crizotinib for ALCL 
achieved CR. 
Efficacy results obtained within the small cohorts of patients treated for IMT report comparable ORR 
even though the 2018’s results presented by the MAH for the EORTC 90101 CREATE study are not up 
to date since the final analysis as of data cut-off on 28th January 2021 describe an ORR reaching 
66.7% (95% CI 34.9-90.1%) in ALK+ IMT patients and a 3-year OS rates of 83.3% (95% CI 48.2-
95.6).  
These supplementary historical data for the IMT indication are as well very encouraging and altogether 
in line with the results provided within this application where the ORR for the 14 patients in the IMT 
group was of 85.7% (95%CI: 60.1, 96.0) across all dose levels. 
The MAH discussed in depth the 5 literature references provided describing two abrupt relapses cases 
from which one patient was switched to ceritinib with rapid clinical improvement and a durable CR. The 
other patient resumed crizotinib and remained in CR. There was an additional case of a patient 
progressing while receiving crizotinib, the MAH broadly discussed this case which was not an abrupt 
relapse one. The data provided regarding abrupt relapses in ALCL and IMT patients are limited at this 
time and definitely need more characterization since the mechanism is not known yet. Minimum 
inhibition duration and thus treatment duration to avoid such early relapses after treatment 
discontinuation also need to be better characterized. It is highly recommended that the MAH closely 
monitors documented abrupt relapses cases in the PSURs. 
The final approved indication was as follows: ” The treatment of paediatric patients (age ≥ 6 to < 18 
years) with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large 
cell lymphoma (ALCL) and for the treatment of paediatric patients (age ≥6 to <18 years)  recurrent or 
refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive unresectable inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour 
(IMT)”.  
In order to address the expressed concerns regarding the small number of patients enrolled and possible 
data gaps, the MAH proposed to implement PAMs requested by the FDA to further assess the PK and 
efficacy of crizotinib at the lower dose of 165 mg/m2 BID in paediatric patients. Although it was difficult 
to  amend  the  study  protocols,  these  additional  data  are  highly  expected,  the  MAH  confirmed  that 
paediatric patients will also be enrolled at 280 mg/m² BID and efficacy analysis performed in this setting.  
As the MAH has processed and provided the audit findings as a surrogate to non processed protocol 
deviations, since these latter do not appear to challenge the reproducibility nor the reliability of the 
efficacy results, and since all published results from the supportive studies and supplementary cohorts 
still confirm the quite outstanding tumour activity of crizotinib in the sought indications, as revised 
above. 
2.4.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of a single pivotal non-comparative study shows a clinically relevant activity of crizotinib in 
the two claimed indications and in view of the unmet medical need in the targeted paediatric setting, the 
combined phase 1/2 study design is considered appropriate. Data obtained from historical comparator 
studies were also submitted and could serve to assist with the interpretation of efficacy data from the 
submitted single-arm studies. Efficacy results (ORR, CR and rapid and durable) were quite outstanding 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 72/149 
 
 
 
 
 
and remained stable across all age groups including ALCL patients between 18 and 21. The MAH provided 
an  exhaustive  review  of  all  published  data  for  crizotinib  within  the  two  claimed  indications  in  the 
paediatric  setting  and  all  results  from  the  small  provided  cohort  were  supportive  of  the  pivotal  study 
results.  
The available data regarding abrupt relapses in ALCL and IMT patients are limited and definitely need 
more  characterization  since  the  mechanism  is  not  known  yet.  Minimum  inhibition  duration  and  thus 
treatment duration to avoid such early relapses after treatment discontinuation also need to be better 
characterized.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  the  MAH  closely  monitors  documented  abrupt  relapses 
cases in the PSURs.  
Lastly, as two different formulations were used within the submitted studies including the oral solution 
which  is  not  available  on  the  market,  an  efficacy  analysis  by  formulation  was  provided  but  no  clear 
conclusions regarding formulation-effect could be drawn for efficacy parameters. It should be noted that 
a paediatric microsphere encapsulated formulation is under development with 3 strengths: 20 mg, 50 
mg, and 150 mg and a type 2 variation is planned for Q2 2023 in order to seek a line extension. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:  
1. 
The MAH will further assess the PK and efficacy of crizotinib at the lower dose of 165 mg/m2 BID 
and  in  paediatric  patients  enrolled  at  280  mg/m²  BID  and  efficacy  analysis  performed  in  this 
setting.  
2.5 Clinical safety 
2.5.1 Introduction 
Crizotinib (Xalkori) as monotherapy is approved in Europe for the following indications: 
• The first-line treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
• The treatment of adults with previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
• The treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Therefore, the safety profile is characterized in adult population with solid ALK positive or ROS-1 positive 
NSCLC. 
The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with either ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC 
are vision disorder, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, oedema, constipation, elevated transaminases, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, dizziness, and neuropathy. 
In  this  application  for  an  extension  of  indication  in  children  with  ALK-positive  anaplastic  large  cell 
lymphoma (ALCL) or Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT), the safety analysis population includes 
25 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 16 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT. 
To support this application, safety data of 69 paediatric patients with other tumour types were further 
provided. 
These data were retrieved from the two following non comparatives studies: 
•  ADVL0912, a Phase 1/2 Study of PF-02341066, An Oral Small Molecule Inhibitor of Anaplastic 
Lymphoma Kinase and c-MET, in Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors and 
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, which included 22 patients with ALK+ ALCL, 14 Patients with 
ALK+ IMT and 69 patients with other tumour types. 
At the time of the submission, this study was completed (last patient last visit: 19 January 2018) 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 73/149 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A8081013, a Phase 1b Open-Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity of Crizotinib (PF-
02341066) in Tumors with Genetic Events Involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Gene 
Locus, which included 3 patients with ALK+ ALCL and 2 Patients with ALK+ IMT. 
At the time of this submission, this study was ongoing (data cutoff date: 03 September 2019). 
Patients  received  the  treatment until  disease  progression or  as  long  as  there was  evidence  of  clinical 
benefit in the judgment of the Investigator. 
The data were presented separately by study as well as pooled sets. 
- The term "pool" is only used when data are combined between the 2 studies (Study ADVL0912 and 
Study A8081013) 
- The term "group" is only used when data are from an individual study, ie either Study ADVL0912 or 
Study A8081013.  
4  pooled  dataset  were  described:  “Pooled  ALCL”,  “Pooled  IMT”,  “Pooled  ALCL+IMT”  and  “Pooled  All 
tumour types”. 
Additional  informations  in  the  summary  of  safety  data  are  provided  from  study  ANHL12PI.  Study 
ANHL12P1 is a randomized Phase 2 NCI-sponsored trial of brentuximab vedotin (BV) or crizotinib (CZ) 
in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients with ALCL. Patients were <22 years of 
age at the time of study enrollment.

Adverse events  
A summary of treatment-emergent AEs of all-causality and treatment-related were presented by SOC 
and PT. In addition, AE summaries by PT or cluster terms in descending frequency were reported for all 
AEs  (all-causality  and  treatment-related),  and  AEs  with  Grade  ≥3  (Grades  3,  or  4  and  Grade  5, 
separately). 
Cluster  terms  were  created  because  the  frequency  of  certain  medical  concepts  or  conditions  were 
underestimated by the reliance on single MedDRA PTs (Table 45). Thus, certain PTs were analysed in 
aggregate using cluster terms. Patients having more than 1 AE PT within a cluster term contributed 1 
event to the cluster term at the highest grade observed. Cluster terms are presented using capital letters 
throughout this CSR while MedDRA PTs are written with only the first letter capitalised.

ADRs  from  the  ALCL+IMT  pool  were  compared  to  adult  patients  with  ALK-positive  or  ROS1-positive 
NSCLC (Table 62). There were no changes in the ADR listing since the last regulatory submission for a 
new indication. 
The  Grade  3  or  4  ADRs  of  NEUTROPENIA  and  LEUKOPENIA  were  reported  with  higher  frequency 
(difference of ≥10%) in the ALCL+IMT pool than the adult population with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive 
NSCLC (Table 62). Of note, the number of adult patients (N=1722) is about 15 times higher than the 
number of paediatric patients (N=110); the age, comorbidities and underlying conditions are also very 
different in these 2 populations, and this could explain the differences in the frequencies. 
Although  not  all  ADRs  identified  in  the  adult  population  have  been  observed  in  clinical  studies  of 
paediatric patients, the same ADRs for adults should be considered for paediatric patients.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
For comparative purposes, the all-causality frequency of AESIs are from adult patients.The number of 
adult  patients  (N=1722)  is  about  40  times  higher  that  the  number  of  paediatric  patients  (ALCL+IMT 
pool, N=41); the age, comorbidities and underlying conditions are different in these 2 populations, and 
this could explain, in part, the differences in the frequencies.

Deaths 
Study ADVL0912 
In the ALCL+IMT group, there were no deaths related to crizotinib treatment and similarly, there were 
no Grade 5 AEs (Table 73). 
A  total  of  8  deaths  (all  in  the  Other  Tumours  group)  were  reported  in  the  clinical  database  (Study 
ADVL0912). Of these, 2 occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of crizotinib. In addition, 1 death 
due to non-treatment related sepsis occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of crizotinib but was 
reported only in the Pfizer Global Safety database (Study ADVL0912). Of the 6 patients who died within 
30 days after the last dose of crizotinib, 5 deaths were due to disease under study and 1 was reported 
as due to both disease progression and protocol treatment (cause of death Haemorrhage intracranial)

Other significant events 
Thrombotic events were reported in study ANHL12P1 in patients receiving crizotinib in association with 
chemotherapy.  
Study ANHL12P1 is a randomised Phase 2 NCI-sponsored trial of brentuximab vedotin (BV) or crizotinib 
(CZ) in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients with ALCL. Patients were <22 years 
of  age  at  the  time  of  study  enrollment.  Patients  in  Arm  BV  received  brentuximab  vedotin  plus  a 
chemotherapy regimen and patients in Arm CZ received crizotinib plus a chemotherapy regimen. The 
protocol  involved  6  cycles  of  treatment,  and  the  chemotherapy  regimen  included  cyclophosphamide, 
dexamethasone, ifosfamide, methotrexate, etoposide, cytarabine, methotrexate and doxorubicin. 
Pfizer was notified on 08 July 2016 that NCI temporarily suspended enrollment in the Arm CZ of Study 
ANHL12P1 due to a higher incidence of thromboembolic events in Arm CZ compared to Arm BV, which 
included 5 events versus 1 event, respectively. On 23 June 2017, FDA placed Study ANHL12P1 on partial 
clinical hold because of the higher than expected rates of thromboembolic events in patients receiving 
crizotinib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  Subsequently,  the  protocol  for  Study  ANHL12P1  was 
amended in order to re-open enrollment in Arm CZ and included required implementation of prophylactic 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022

anticoagulation in this arm of the study. Additional stopping rules for Arm CZ were also added with this 
amendment. Specifically, further enrollment into the Arm CZ would be discontinued if any of the following 
occurred in patients enrolled after Amendment 6A: 
2 CVL-associated thrombotic events: 
- Any one event of: 
- Thromboembolic event requiring surgical intervention, or 
- Pulmonary embolism 
- 2 bleeding events, defined as Grade 2 or higher hemorrhage events corresponding to bleeding events 
which required intervention and consisted of major bleeding and clinically relevant minor bleeding. 
The stopping rules were met with 2 additional thrombotic events in Arm CZ, and patients on this arm 
were instructed to permanently discontinue crizotinib in February 2019; however, patients in Arm CZ 
could continue treatment on chemotherapy alone. As of 30 June 2019, 137 patients had been enrolled 
(Arm BV, n=68; Arm CZ, n=69) (ANHL12P1 Study Progress Report 2019). 
A  total  of  13  cases  of  thromboembolic  events  were  reported  in  the  66  patients  treated  in  Arm  CZ  of 
Study ANHL12P1. Upon review of these cases from the Pfizer Global Safety database and information 
provided  by  COG,  it  was  noted  that  most  cases  were  related to  indwelling  venous  catheters  used  for 
multiple chemotherapy agents which may have had a contributory role. In addition, 2 of the 13 patients 
had genetic mutations which predisposed them to thrombotic events. It was also noted that potentially 
serious thrombocytopenia is a known ADR of brentuximab vedotin and this may explain the lower number 
of thromboembolic events in the BV arm.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  test  data  in  this  study  consisted  of  hematology  values  (hemoglobin,  neutrophils  [abs], 
platelets, and white blood cell count), chemistry tests (ALT, albumin, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphate,  and  total  bilirubin),  and  urine  tests.  Laboratory  test  results  were  entered  in  the  clinical 
database at baseline and weekly for the first cycle of treatment. 
After Cycle 1, the corresponding laboratory test results were not entered into the clinical database and 
therefore are not included in the CSR. According to COG’s procedures, any abnormalities in laboratory 
test results that were considered clinically relevant were to be reported as AEs. 
Normal  ranges  were  implemented  to  identify  values  that  were  outside  the  normal  ranges  and 
programmatically created the NCI toxicity grade using the CTCAE v 4.0. 
For  patients  with  Grade  ≥3  laboratory  test  values,  a  by-patient  data  listing was  presented  to  display 
data including visit label, assessment date (day), laboratory test value, normal range flag (low, normal, 
and high), and change from baseline value. The baseline value was flagged in this data listing.

Study ADVL0912 
No paediatric patients in either of the ALCL, IMT, or ALCL + IMT groups had a shift in chemistry laboratory 
test results from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline. 
Laboratory tests were only collected for Cycle 1 and thus, in order to evaluate potential Hy’s law cases 
for Study ADVL0912 after Cycle 1, the AEs associated with Blood bilirubin increased/ Hyperbilirubinaemia 
(Grade  ≥2)  that  occurred  concurrently  with  AST  increased  and/or  ALT  increased  (Grade  ≥1)  were 
evaluated. There were no potential Hy’s Law cases reported for paediatric patients of Study ADVL0912

Vital Signs, Electrocardiograms, and Other Observations Related to Safety (Growth plate and 
vision disorders) 
Study ADVL0912 
  Vital Signs (Body Weight only) and ECG 
Only  body  weight  (kg),  height  (cm)  and  BSA  (m2)  were  collected  on  the  CRF  for  Study  ADVL0912. 
According to COG’s procedures, any clinically relevant findings related to vital signs data were reported 
as  AEs.  For  this  reason,  no  pooling  of  vital  sign  data  was  performed.  ECGs  were  not  collected  post-

baseline  in  Study  ADVL0912.  Thus,  ECG  parameter  data  on  treatment  are  only  available  for  Study 
A8081013.  
No changes in body weight were considered clinically relevant. As this was a study in paediatric patients, 
increases  body  weight  over  time  were  expected.  9/22  patients  in  the  ALCL  group  had  a  maximum 
increase  in  body  weight  from  baseline  of  ≥7%  and  6/22  patients  had  a  maximum  decrease  in  body 
weight from baseline of ≥ 3.5%. All patients in the IMT group had a maximum increase in body weight 
from baseline of ≥7%. 
  Growth Plate Alterations 
Thirty-one patients had tibial growth plate status assessments at baseline (10 patients in the ALCL group, 
6 patients in the IMT group, and 15 patients in the Other Tumours group). Of these patients, 27 had 
open growth plates at baseline and were assessed in subsequent cycles. 
No growth plate abnormalities were observed in paediatric patients overall. 
  Ophthalmic Examination 
Due to limitations in how data were collected on the CRF, summarizations of visual acuity data could not 
be performed. Of the 105 paediatric patients who had visual acuity evaluations at baseline, 42 patients 
were only recorded with “Yes/No”. 
Study A8081013 
  Vital Signs 
No vital sign changes were reported as AEs 
  Electrocardiograms 
Of the 3 patients in the ALCL group, 2 had maximum post-dose QTcF <480 msec and 1 had QTcF ≥500 
msec and also a maximum increase from baseline in QTcF ≥60 msec on treatment (See Study A8081013 
CSR Section 12.5.2.1.2). No AEs of all-causality Electrocardiogram QT prolonged were reported. 
Of the 2 patients in the IMT group, none had a QTcF ≥500 msec or a maximum increase from baseline 
in QTcF ≥60 msec. 
No patients met the pre-specified categorical criteria for a clinical significant change on QRS complex or 
PR interval 
  Ophthalmic Examination 
For biomicroscope examinations, the 3 patients in the ALCL group had normal results at baseline and no 
changes from baseline. The 2 paediatric patients in the IMT group had normal results at baseline but 
with  no  follow-up  examinations.  For  ocular  characteristics,  the  3  patients  in  the  ALCL  group  had  no 
changes from baseline, with 2 having normal results and 1 with nevi or freckles on conjunctiva bulbi at 
baseline. The 2 paediatric patients in the IMT group had normal results at baseline but with no follow-
up examinations. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors ( Age, gender, race) 
Data were examined for the effects of age, gender and race, by dose, and tumour type on crizotinib in 
patients of Study ADVL0912 and Study A8081013 as shown in the following sections. The small number 
of patients in the different subgroups does not allow for definitive conclusions to be made. However, the 
most frequent AEs (elevated transaminases, Vomiting, neutropenia, Nausea, Diarrhoea and leukopenia) 
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 119/149 
 
 
 
were reported in all subgroups, independent of age, gender, race or tumour types. The frequencies of 
each of these AEs slightly varied among subgroups. 
The MAH provided numerous tables by age range for treatment duration, relative dose and average daily 
dose, treatment related adverse events, all causality serious adverse, treatment-related serious adverse 
events by PT or cluster term, dose reduction, dosing interruption, permanent treatment discontinuation, 
Shift  Summary  Results  of  Laboratory  Tests  by  Maximum  CTCAE  Grade  (hematology  and  chemistry, 
categorisation of body weight). However, it is difficult to draw any conclusion considering low number of 
patients included and multiple data. 
In order to have a more general view of data by age ranges, the MAH completed the following table for 
each indication at 280 mg/m² BID including age range 2-<6 years given the requested enlargement of 
age range. Although no difference between classes of age can be evidenced at this time, no conclusion 
can be drawn considering the low number of subjects in each category (see table below).

Extrinsic factors 
No new information relevant to the effect of extrinsic factors is available for inclusion in this submission. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
In Study A8081013, 1 patient in the IMT group (17 years of age at the time of enrollment) had an AE of 
pregnancy reported on Day 1891 as an ‘exposure during pregnancy” 
Overdose 
In Study ADVL0912, no AEs resulting from medication error were reported, or overdose. 
In Study A8081013, an AE of Injury, poisoning and procedural complications/Overdose’ was reported in 
1 patient. No AEs were associated with the overdose. No action was taken following the overdose of 1 x 
250 mg capsule.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no new information on drug-drug interactions. In Study ADVL0912 and Study A8081013, no 
AEs of drug interactions were reported 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study ADVL0912 
Permanent treatment discontinuation 
In Study ADVL0912, the AE CRF page did not include a field for ‘action taken with study drug’. Thus, this 
did not allow for the generation of tables for AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation, dose 
reduction or temporary discontinuation of treatment. From the patient disposition CRF page, it could be 
determined whether a permanent treatment discontinuation was associated with an AE(s). However, the 
specific AE(s) was not provided on this CRF page and thus, in most cases, the specific AE(s) associated 
with the permanent treatment of crizotinib could not be determined. A listing of AEs that were ongoing 
at the time of permanent treatment discontinuation as well as a listing of SAEs that were present within 
20 days of permanent treatment discontinuation are provided. Because of the nature of these data, no 
summary tables could be produced. The information on permanently discontinued treatment associated 
with AE(s) for Study ADVL0912 provided in this section was based on the patient disposition CRF page. 
A  total  of  105  paediatric  patients  (22  in  the  ALCL  group,  14  in  the  IMT  group,  and  69  in  the  Other 
Tumours  group)  received  at  least  1  dose  of  crizotinib  (Table  79).  As  of  the  date  of  study  closure,  all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib were off study as follows: 
o  ALCL Group: Of the 22 paediatric patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib, 20 (90.9%) 
paediatric patients had discontinued from study and 2 (9.1%) paediatric patients on treatment 
at the date of study closure were switched to commercial supplies (Table 79). 
The most frequent (> 20% of patients) reasons for discontinuation were physician decision and refusal 
of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian.  
In addition, 11 patients in the ALCL group permanently discontinued crizotinib due to HSCT 
o 
IMT Group: Of the 14 paediatric patients who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib, 11 (78.6%) 
paediatric  patients  had  discontinued  from  the  study  and  3  (21.4%)  paediatric  patients  on 
treatment  at  the  date  of  study  closure  were  switched  to  commercial  supplies (Table  79).  The 
most frequent (> 20% of patients) reasons for discontinuation were adverse event and physician 
decision. 
The  most  frequent  (>20%  of  patients)  reason  for  discontinuation  was  physician  decision  Permanent 
discontinuation from treatment associated with an AE occurred in 11 (10.5%) patients (1 patient in the 
ALCL  group  associated  with  NEUTROPENIA,  4  patients  in  the  IMT  group  and  6  patients  in  the  other 
tumour Group).

2.5.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
Xalkori as single agent has been approved in Europe in 2012 and is indicated for adult patients with ALK-
positive  and  ROS-1-positive  NSCLC.  The  MAH  has  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  in  paediatric 
patients with resistant/refractory ALK-positive ALK + ALCL and ALK-positive IMT. 
Safety data for this application are mainly based on 2 non comparative studies. Study ADVL0912 was a 
phase  I/II  trial  with  a  dose-escalation  part  and  a  dose  expansion  part.  Safety  population  of  study 
ADVL0912 includes 22 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 14 paediatric patients with ALK-
positive IMT. In addition, study ADVL0912 includes 69 patients in the “other tumour group” with tumours 
presenting ALK or MET alterations and are considered as supportive data. Study A8081013 is a phase Ib 
trial in which 3 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 2 paediatric patients with ALK-positive 
IMT were included. 
Both studies provided data for a limited number of patients which is expected due to the rarity of the 
targeted indications. Data are presented by study and indication and also as pooled data, which is an 
acceptable strategy given the small number of patients.  
Study A8081013 was ongoing at the time of the MAA submission and updated data are expected to be 
provided under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Patient exposure 
In Study ADVL0912, the intended dose (280 mg/m² BID) was received by 28 patients in the targeted 
indications while all 5 patients from study A801013 received the intended dose. Limited data are available 
Assessment report

to  assess  lower  doses  (7  patients  received  the  dose  of  165  mg/m²  BID  and  only  1  patient  received 
100mg/m² BID) in Study ADVL0912. 
The median duration of treatment for patients with IMT in study ADVL0912 was 22.88 months overall 
and 18.86 months at the intended dose. The majority of patients at 280 mg/m² BID 8/12) had a duration 
of treatment ≥ 12 months. In addition, both patients with IMT study A801013 had a treatment duration 
≥ 12 months. 
On the other hand, the median duration of treatment for patients with ALCL in study ADVL0912 was 5.11 
months overall and 4.21 months at the intended dose. The shorter median duration of treatment in ALCL 
patients  compared  to  IMT  patients  can  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  fact  that  11  of  these  patients 
permanently discontinued crizotinib to undergo HSCT. Only 5 ALCL patients within both studies treated 
at the intended dose had a treatment duration≥ 12 months. Overall, long term data are scarce, especially 
for patients with ALCL.  
Mean relative dose at the intended posology was 88.68% and 85.52% for ALCL and IMT respectively in 
study ADL0912. Dose reductions and dosing interruptions in case of toxicities were allowed by protocol, 
which  may  explain  the  relative  dose  results.  However,  considering  the  unclear  informations  on  the 
formulations received by the patients, it could not be excluded that a poor observance in young patients 
may have contributed to these data. The MAH discussed these data with regards to the observance and 
a potential issue was not evidenced. 
Demographic 
The safety population reflects the population of the claimed indication with patients between 6 and 18 
years old, a majority of white patients, a majority of males in ALCL indication and a majority of women 
in IMT indication. Younger patients were included providing data for patients < 6 years old. 
Adverse events 
The MAH reported TEAE by SOC and PT and further created “cluster terms” (in capital letters) to address 
the  reliance  on  single  MedDRA  PT.  This  methodology  was  previously  used  in  initial  application  of 
XALKORI.  
In both studies ADVL0912 and A8081013, TEAEs were observed in 100% of the safety population. In 
both indications, at the intended dose of 280mg/m² BID, the majority of patients experienced grade 3 
or 4 AEs (95.5% of ALCL patients and 78.5 % of IMT patients). No grade 5 AE were reported in ALCL or 
IMT patients.  
The nature of the most frequently reported TEAEs in paediatric patients are consistent with the nature 
of  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  of  crizotinib  in  adult  patients  (elevated  transaminases,  Vomiting, 
neutropenia, Nausea, Diarrhoea, and leukopenia). The most frequently reported all-causality grade 3 or 
4 AE in all paediatric patients was neutropenia. Furthermore, all grade 3/4 AE from paediatric population 
were observed with the same severity (as grade 3/4 AE) in the adults population except for neutropenia 
(see  below).  These  TEAE  are  listed  in  the  SmPC  of  Xalkori  (elevated  transaminases,  neutropenia, 
leukopenia, bradycardia, Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and oedema). 
In study ADVL0912, the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AE was neutropenia in 
ALCL (63.6 %) and IMT (50.0%) population.  
In study A8081013, grade 3/4 treatment-related TEAE were reported in 2/3 ALCL patients and 1/2 IMT 
patient  (neutropenia,  vomiting,  elevated  transaminases  and  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK) 
increase.  The  grade  4  AE  of  CPK  increase  was  considered  as  a  SAE.  This  event  resolved  after  a 
temporarily withdrawal of crizotinib which was then resumed at a reduce dose. Moreover, three other 
grade  4  CPK  increase  were  observed  in  the  adult  population,  2  of  which  were  considered  as  SAE. 
However, all SAE of CPK increase were reported from the same site where it is routine practice to test 
CPK for cancer patients. Moreover, for 5 of the 6 patients in both studies, CPK increase occurred in a 
context of strenuous physical activity. Events of blood CPK increase and rhabdomyolisis are currently 
followed in the PSUR and a review of both events is expected in the next PSUR.

Regarding frequency of AE, it appears that gastrointestinal toxicities occurred at a higher frequency in 
the paediatric population compared to the adult population (nausea: 82.9% vs 56.6%, diarrhoea: 85.4% 
vs  54.0%  and  vomiting:  95.1%  vs  50.8).  Recommendations  for  the  management  of  gastrointestinal 
toxicities  specifically  for  paediatric  population  have  been  added  in  section  4.4  of  the  proposed  SmPC 
which is acknowledged considering the higher risk of dehydration in children. 
In  addition,  ELEVATED  TRANSAMINASES  were  observed  at  a  higher  frequency  in  the  paediatric 
population  compared  to  the  adult  population  (85.4%  vs  32.1  %).  Dose  modifications  as  well  as  the 
recommendations for monitoring in the SmPC appear currently acceptable since very frequent. Of note, 
hepatotoxicity is listed as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Blood creatinine increase was also observed at a higher frequency in paediatric population relative to 
adult population (41.5% vs 8.0%). Although monitoring of blood creatinine was already recommended 
in the SmPC, it seems that additional recommendations for paediatric population are needed. Indeed, 
although  acute  renal  failure,  an  expected  AE  in  adult  population,  was  not  observed  in  paediatric 
population, the limited number of patients does not allow to exclude this AE in paediatrics. In response 
to a request, the MAH agreed to a close monitoring through PSUR of renal toxicity in post-marketing 
setting provided favourable outcome of the marketing authorisation from the CHMP.  
Considering adverse reactions listed in the SmPC for adult population, some PTs were not reported in 
paediatrics. Among them, syncope, interstitial lung disease, hepatic failure and renal cyst will be closely 
monitored  in  post  marketing  setting  in  PSUR  through  the  corresponding  safety  concerns  listed  in  the 
RMP and renal failure will be closely monitored through PSUR as requested above. Additional data on 
blood  testosterone  decrease  are  currently  collected  in  the  ongoing  study  ITCC  053  ‘CRISP’  study 
(protocol title:  A phase 1B of crizotinib either in combination or as single agent in pediatric patients with 
ALK, ROS1 or MET positive malignancies) proposed as PAM provided a favourable outcome of the CHMP 
in addition to tanner stage to assess the impact of crizotinib on puberty.  
PT of abdominal pain was observed in 18/41 patients of pooled ALCL + IMT patients. No other information 
was provided. Abdominal pain was included in table 8 of the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8)  
Serious adverse events 
In study ADVL0912, SAEs were reported in 31.8% and 7.1% of ALCL and IMT patient respectively. 
Treatment-related  SAEs  were  experienced  by  5  ALCL  patients:  3  patients  at  165  mg/m²  BID  and  2 
patients  at  280  mg/m²  BID.  2  patients  at  165mg/m²  were  5  years  old  (hypoalbuminemia  and  blood 
creatinine increase for one patient and kidney enlargement for the other patient) while the third patient 
was 13 years old and experienced neutropenia and cyanopsia. Both patients at 280 mg/m² BID were 14 
years old and experienced infective myositis and skin infection for 1 patient and tumour lysis syndrome 
(TLS) for the other patient. In IMT patients, only one patient experienced a treatment related SAE of 
bradycardia at 280 mg/m² BID.  
Kidney enlargement did not recovered at the end of therapy. However, it is not clear from the provided 
documents if this AE led to discontinuation of treatment. Indeed, kidney enlargement is not reported at 
the last patient visit. However, as agreed by the MAH, renal toxicity will be closely monitored through 
PSUR in post marketing setting provided favourable outcome of the marketing authorisation from the 
CHMP, which will allow further characterization of renal toxicity. 
Laboratory test findings 
Neutrophil count decrease was the most frequent haematological laboratory finding which is consistent 
with adverse events data. 
Importantly, it is to be noted that in study ADVL0912, laboratory evaluations were reported in the CRF 
only for Cycle 1 and reported afterwards only if laboratory test results were considered clinically relevant. 
In that case, they were to be reported as AEs. This issue raises concerns about the comprehensiveness 
of  data  for  cycles  ≥  2  and  about  cumulative  toxicity.  Supplemental  analysis  could  not  resolved these 
concern. However, laboratory test data grade 3/4 are collected in ongoing CRISP study proposed as PAM 
provided a favourable outcome of the CHMP.

Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and anemia were not reported in the pooled data of study ADVL0912 and 
are not reported as adverse reaction in the specific table 8 of the SmPC for paediatric patients section 
4.8. However, dosing modifications are provided in Table 5 of the SmPC section 4.2 in case of grade 3 
and  4  platelet  count  decrease  and  anemia.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  clarify  the  need  for  these 
recommendations and for inclusion of PT of thrombocytopenia and anemia in table 8 of the SmPC. The 
MAH agreed to update the SmPC regarding anemia since it is a known ADR in adult patients and has 
been reported in children. 
Other observations related to safety 
Visual acuity 
In  study  ADVL0912,  due  to  limitations  in  how  data  were  collected  on  the  CRF,  a  comprehensive 
assessment  is  not  possible.  For  this  reason  and  considering  any  potential  difficulties  to  explain  and 
verbalize  ocular  acuity  disorders  in  younger  patients,  additional  monitoring  and  dose  modifications 
recommendations were requested and agreed by the MAH. 
Bone growth 
Non-clinical data evidenced a decrease in bone formation and in study ADVL0912, only 31/105 patients 
(29.5%) of the safety paediatric population (all tumour types) had tibial growth plate status assessments 
at  baseline.  In  addition,  bone  fracture  case  reports  have  been  reported  with  crizotinib  including  in 
paediatric patients. The MAH was requested to discuss measures to better identify and characterize the 
risk of bone toxicities and on bone growth in post-marketing setting provided favorable outcome of the 
MA by the CHMP. Inclusion of this safety concern in the RMP was to be discussed.  
Overall,  while  it  is  endorsed  that  cases  of  bone  toxicity  reported  in  clinical  studies  have  confounding 
factors, a pharmacological mechanism and non-clinical data of crizotinib supported by non-clinical data 
of other ALK inhibitors do not allow to exclude a risk in human. The MAH agreed to add “bone toxicities 
and impaired bone growth” in the RMP as an important potential risk in paediatric population. In addition, 
tibial growth plate is assessed in ongoing study CRZ-NBALCL (Protocol WI218627.  Title: A phase I/II 
study  of  crizotinib  for  recurrent  or  refractory  ALK-positive  ALCL  and  phase  I  study  of  this  drug  for 
recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma) while bone toxicities will be reported as AEs. 
Safety in special groups and situation 
The MAH provided numerous tables by age range making difficult to draw any conclusion considering 
low number of patients and multiple data. In order to have a more general view of data by age ranges. 
The MAH was requested to complete an adequate table. Although no difference between classes of age 
can be evidenced at this time, no conclusion can be drawn considering the low number of subjects in 
each category. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  study  ADVL0912,  only  1/22  patient  in  ALCL  group  and  4/14  patients  in  IMT  group  discontinued 
treatment due to an adverse event. This difference may be attributed to the shorter duration of treatment 
for patients in ALCL group who received HSCT. Dose reductions occurred in 3/22 patients in ALCL group 
and in 4/14 patients in IMT group. Median dose reduction were shorter in ALCL group compared to IMT 
group  with  4.00  and  37.14  weeks  in  ALCL  and  IMT  group  respectively.  No  discontinuation  or  dose 
reduction occurred in study A8081013.  
Finally,  dosing  interruptions  were  frequent  (68%  and  75%  of  pooled  ALCL  patients  and  IMT  patients 
respectively).  The  majority  of  treatment  interruptions  was  <  1  week  for  ALCL  pool  whereas  no  such 
generalisation can be made for IMT pool. 
The AEs which led to discontinuation, dose reduction and treatment interruption in study ADVL0912 were 
not presented due to the absence of a specific field in the CRF. However, those reasons are to be collected 
in  the  ongoing  study  CRISP  proposed  as  PAM  provided  a  favourable  outcome  of  the  CHMP  which  will 
allow further characterization of the safety profile.

Post marketing experience 
Due to limited available data in paediatrics, a summary of all available safety data of post-marketing use 
of crizotinib in paediatric population as well as safety data issued from compassionate use in ALCL and 
IMT paediatric patients was requested and did not alter the described safety profile of crizotinib.  
2.5.2 Conclusions on clinical safety 
Xalkori  showed  a  safety  profile  mainly  related  to  gastrointestinal,  hepatic,  haematological  and  renal 
toxicity. These AE are known AR in adult population but occurred at a higher frequencies in paediatric 
patients than in the adult population. Similar severities to the adult population were observed except for 
neutropenia  grade  3/4  which  was  observed  at  a  notable  higher  frequency  in  paediatric  patients. 
Additional monitoring and management of these AE are provided in the SmPC of Xalkori with adaptation 
for paediatric population when required. 
In addition, as Visual disorders may be more challenging to assess in the paediatric population a specific 
monitoring and additional management are now recommended.  
Concerns about bone toxicities and bone growth in the paediatric population will be addressed in part in 
ongoing study CRZ-NBALCL. In addition, “bone toxicities and impaired bone growth” has been added as 
important potential risk in the RMP.  
Overall, the evaluation of additional requested data and the implementation of monitoring and 
management of key toxicities allowed to resolve number of uncertainties on the safety profile of 
Xalkori.  
2.5.3 PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.5.4 Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to 
communicate on the risk of ocular toxicity (including risk of severe visual loss) and need for monitoring 
in paediatric patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and positive anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL) or with ALK positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT). The MAH should 
agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. The 
DHPC should be sent upon receipt of the Commission Decision with the revised SmPC with the changes 
highlighted to Paediatric oncologists, paediatric haemato-oncologists, ophthalmologists and hospital 
pharmacists. Additional recipients to be further defined at national level, incl. professional societies and 
national associations, depending on the national healthcare system and in agreement with the 
respective national competent authority.

2.7 Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to visual disorders and a warning on severe 
gastrointestinal toxicities in children has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1 User consultation

3. Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1 Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1 Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the original indication for crizotinib to include treatment of 
paediatric patients (age ≥ 6 to < 18 years) with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and with unresectable, recurrent, or 
refractory ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT). 
3.1.2 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
  Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) 
ALCL is a chemosensitive malignancy both in paediatric and adult patients.  The majority (84-90%) of 
ALCL  in  children  has  been  reported  to  be  ALK-positive  (Burkhardt  et  al,  2005;  Le  Deley  et  al,  2008; 
Mussolin et al, 2010); whereas, studies have shown only ~50% of adult ALCL contain the ALK fusion 
gene  (Gascoyne  et  al,  1999;  Mussolin  et  al,  2010).    Treatment  regimens  are  based  on  short-pulse 
chemotherapy  and  high-dose  MTX,  cyclophosphamide,  vincristine,  doxorubicin,  vinblastine,  and 
corticosteroids. There is no consensus on the treatment of relapsed or refractory paediatric ALCL.  Unlike 
other  lymphomas,  ALCL  is  usually  still  chemosensitive  at  relapse.    Induction  therapy  (including  with 
multiagent  regimens  such  as  CCNU,  and  Ara-C  or  vindesine,  dexamethasone,  Ara-C,  and  etoposide) 
followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic HSCT after a second CR is frequently 
used  for  treatment  of  relapsed  ALCL.      Patients  with  subsequent  relapses  can  also  obtain  prolonged 
remission following the administration of single-agent vinblastine.  Crizotinib could be a new treatment 
option for paediatric patients with ALK-positive relapsed or refractory ALCL.  
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) 
IMT is a class of tumour that presents a characteristic histological picture comprising a spindle cell 
proliferation with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes (Souid 
et al, 1993).  Approximately 50%-70% of IMTs are positive for ALK expression (Mossé et al, 2009). 
Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but a complete surgical resection may not always be 
possible.  Local recurrences have been reported with tumour invasion and fatal outcomes and there 
are no approved therapies for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory IMT and no standard 
therapy for aggressive unresectable tumours. IMTs may respond initially to systemic corticosteroids, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or chemotherapeutics including vincristine, methotrexate, 
etoposide, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. Crizotinib could be 
a new treatment option for paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT, a subgroup that currently lacks 
any approved therapies. 
3.1.3 Main clinical studies 
Efficacy data are mainly based on these 2 non-comparative studies. Study ADVL0912 was a phase I/II 
trial  with  a  dose-escalation  part  and  a  dose  expansion  part.  Efficacy  population  of  study  ADVL0912 
includes 22 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 14 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT. 
Study A8081013 is an ongoing phase Ib trial in which 3 paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 
2 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT were included.

3.2 Favourable effects 
The ORR for the 22 enrolled ALCL patients was 86.4% (95% CI: 66.7, 95.3) for both dose level groups 
(6 patients received 165 mg/m² BID with an ORR of 83.3% and 16 patients received 280 mg/m² BID 
and achieved an ORR of 87.5%). The ORR for the 14 patients in the IMT group was 85.7% (95%CI: 
60.1, 96.0) across all dose levels; 1 patient enrolled at the 100 mg/m2 BID dose level and did not 
have an objective response, 1 patient enrolled at 165 mg/m² BID and had an objective response, and 
12 patients enrolled at 280 mg/m² BID and had an ORR of 91.7%.  
CRs were quite outstanding across study groups and observed in 77.3% (17/22) of patients in the 
ALCL group across both dose levels, and in 83.3% (5/6) and 75.0% (12/16) of patients at the 165 
mg/m² BID and 280 mg/m² BID dose levels, respectively. In the IMT group, CRs were observed in 
35.7% (5/14) of paediatric patients across dose levels.  
ORR and CR results remained stable across all age groups, despite the absence of patients under the 
age of 3, also including ALCL patients between 18 and 21. These results are very encouraging. It is to 
be noted that 100% of the 4 patients between 18 and 21 years-old treated with crizotinib for ALCL 
achieved CR. 
The median DR was of 3.6 months (range: 0.0 to 15.0 months) for the responders across both dose 
levels in the ALCL group; 5 patients with objective tumour response at the 165 mg/m² twice daily dose 
level had a median DR of 6.9 months and 14 patients with objective tumour response at the 280 
mg/m² twice daily dose level had a median DR of 2 months. The DR is quite underestimated here 
because of the 10 patients who proceeded to HSCT after completing objective response (2 at the 165 
mg/m² dose level and 8 at the 280 mg/m²dose level, censored at time of HSCT). A longer median DR 
(9.2 months) is noted for ALCL patients who did not receive an HSCT.  
DR for patients with IMT were more durable, with a median DR of 14.8 months (range: 2.8 to 48.9 
months) for the 12 responders. Eight of the 11 enrolled patients in the 280 mg/m² BID completed the 
study without any event. 
Very rapid responses were observed in the ALCL group with a median time to response (TTR) of 0.9 
months (0.8 to 2.1 months) across both dose levels. Median TTR was comparable between the 165 
mg/m² BID and the 280 mg/m² BID dose level groups (0.9 months and 1 month, respectively). For 
IMT group, the responses were also quite rapid and comparable to those observed in ALCL group, with 
a median TTR of 1 month (0.8 to 4.6 months) across the two dose levels. 
In both dose levels, crizotinib presents similar efficacy results. Data at 280 mg/m² BID are more 
robust considering the larger number of enrolled patients (most patients with ALCL (16 of 22) and 
most patients with IMT (12 of 14) were treated at 280 mg/m² BID). Moreover, due to the paediatric-
inadequate dosage form, dose adjustments below 200 mg are not possible and the 280 mg/m² BID 
dose is allowing more flexible dose reduction recommendations.  
A8081013 study, is an ongoing supportive study aiming to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of 
crizotinib in patients with ALK+ tumours (other than NSCLC). Five paediatric patients were enrolled at 
data cut-off date. Efficacy data from this supportive study do not allow to draw robust conclusions for 
efficacy given the limitations in study design (even though it includes OS and PFS as secondary 
endpoints) and the limited number of paediatric patients enrolled at the time being. The results are 
however in line with those reported in the pivotal study and are quite supportive. 
As part of the justification of the positive B/R balance for crizotinib in the two claimed indications 
among paediatric patients, the MAH provided an exhaustive overview of published data from different 
crizotinib non-sponsored studies, drawing a parallel with the ADVL0912 pivotal study results.  
Assessment report  
EMA/846028/2022  
Page 138/149 
 
 
 
For ALCL patients, the MAH elaborates on the results from the French AcSé program. Since Crizotinib 
has shown significant clinical activity in relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL in small cohorts of patients and 
in order to avoid a generalized off-label use and allow for an equal and nationwide access to crizotinib, 
the French National Cancer Institute (INCa, state organization) launched the AcSé program in patients 
aged 1 year and older with advanced ALK+ ALCL. Median age was 21 years and the median number of 
prior chemotherapy lines was 2 including brentuximab in 66% of patients. Among the 15 evaluable 
patients, 10 achieved an OR (67%, CI95% [42%-85%]) (9CR, 1PR) and 5 experienced a disease 
progression. The response rate was similar in paediatric patients (67%, CI95% [24%, 94%]) and in 
adults (6/9, 67%, CI95% [31%, 91%]) and with a median follow-up of 12 months, the median PFS 
was 11.6 months (CI95% [1.41, NA]). A compassionate use program where Crizotinib was 
administered as monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients who were resistant/refractory to 
cytotoxic therapy also pointed out very encouraging results as the ORR was of 90.9%; (95%CI = 
58.7% to 99.8%). 
Efficacy results obtained within the small cohorts of patients treated for IMT report comparable ORR 
even though the 2018’s results presented by the MAH for the EORTC 90101 CREATE study are not up 
to date since the final analysis as of data cut-off on 28th January 2021 describe an ORR reaching 
66.7% (95% CI 34.9-90.1%) in ALK+ IMT patients and a 3-year OS rates of 83.3% (95% CI 48.2-
95.6).  
All these supplementary studies results are in line with the ADVL0912 pivotal study findings and are 
considered supportive. 
3.3 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Given the rarity of ALCL and IMT in general and in particular in the paediatric setting, the number of 
patients that could be enrolled in each of the groups is small and the results would be sensitive to shifts 
in the data. Efficacy data were assessed as secondary endpoints in the pivotal study and indicate that 
crizotinib has a clinically meaningful benefit as a single agent in paediatric patients within the two claimed 
indications. It should be noted that limitations regarding the analysis of data from the pivotal study are 
related to the fact that the study was not sponsored by the MAH. 
The MAH was asked to justify that available data support the full scope of the proposed indication by 
providing a more comprehensive description of the enrolled patients regarding prior therapies, treatment 
line and transplantation status. No details regarding exact treatment lines nature/settings were provided 
given the fact that the pivotal study was not powered to collect the requested information.  
Post-transplant efficacy and safety data, 100-day mortality and GvHD rates are not available since the 
pivotal study was completed 10 years ago when standards and clinical practices were much different and 
no guidance was planned for proceeding to HSCT within the protocols. No such data were thus collected, 
which also applies for patients for whom crizotinib was used as a bridge to HSCT. The SmPC has been 
amended in order to highlight this data gaps. 
No Pfizer-sponsored studies in adults and in paediatric patients are planned or ongoing with crizotinib 
monotherapy in the claimed indications. The MAH proposed to implement PAMs requested by the FDA to 
further assess the PK and efficacy of crizotinib at the lower dose of 165 mg/m2 BID. The MAH confirmed 
that there was no possibility to amend the study protocols in order to plan the whole package of efficacy 
analyses for the 280 mg/m2 BID dose with a longer FU period for patients undergoing HSCT ensuring 
collection  of  data  regarding  100-day  mortality  and  acute/chronic  GvHD  rates  for  ALCL  patients  and 
surgery statues for the IMT population. However, the MAH has provided some reassurance by confirming 
that patients could however still be enrolled at the 280 mg/m² BID, as Study ITCC 053 has been designed 
to recruit up to 30 patients (including those with IMT) in the stratum 3. Patients with ALK+ rr ALCL can 
be enrolled in stratum 3 once stratum 1b (at 165 mg/m² BID) is completed. As requested during the 
previous round, these additional ongoing studies were added in the RMP and the results planned with 
reasonable timelines.

Two different formulations were used within the submitted studies including the oral solution which is 
not  available  on  the  market.  An  efficacy  analysis  by  formulation  was  also  provided  but  no  clear 
conclusions  regarding  formulation-effect  could  be  drawn  for  efficacy  parameters  compared  to  the 
previously assessed pooled data considering the very limited number of patients especially for the oral 
solution group (6 each in the ALCL and the IMT group). The MAH though confirmed that a paediatric 
microsphere encapsulated formulation is under development with 3 strengths: 20 mg, 50 mg, and 150 
mg and a type 2 variation is planned for Q2 2023 in order to seek the line extension. 
The data provided on abrupt relapses in ALCL and IMT patients are limited at this time and definitely 
need more characterization since the mechanism is yet unknown. Minimum inhibition duration and 
thus treatment duration to avoid such early relapses after treatment discontinuation also need to be 
better characterized. It is highly recommended that the MAH closely monitors documented abrupt 
relapses cases in the PSURs. 
As a response to the request to plan a post authorisation study, the MAH will implement PAMs requested 
by the FDA to further assess the PK and efficacy of crizotinib at 165 mg/m2 BID and secondly at 280 
mg/m2 BID in paediatric patients (see RMP). 
3.4 Unfavourable effects 
 At the data cut-off dates for both ADVL0912 and A8081013 studies, the safety population includes 25 
paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 16 paediatric patients with ALK-positive IMT. Safety data 
of 69 additional patients with other tumours were provided as supportive data.  
TEAE  were  observed  in  100%  of  the  safety  population  with  grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  reported  in 
95.5% of ALCL patients and 78.5 % of IMT patients at the intended dose (280 mg/m2 BID).  
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  pertained  to  SOC  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders 
(Neutropenia, 90.2% and leukopenia, 78.0%), hepatobiliary disorders (elevated transaminases, 85.4%) 
and gastrointestinal disorders (Vomiting, 95.1%; Nausea, 82.9% and Diarrhoea, 85.4%). 
In  addition,  other  adverse  events  that  occurred  frequently  were  vision  disorder  (61%),  Constipation 
(34.1%), and blood creatinine increased (41.5%), bradycardia (17.1%) and oedema (29.3%).  
The  most  frequently  reported  all-causality  Grade  3  or  4  AE  in  all  paediatric  patients  was  neutropenia 
(ALCL  pool:  19  [76.0%]  patients;  IMT  pool:  9  [56.3%]  patients).  Moreover,  all  grade  3/4  AEs  from 
paediatric population were observed with the same severity (as grade 3/4 AE) in the adults population 
and are listed in the SmPC of Xalkori.  
However,  frequencies  of  most  frequent  AEs  differed  notably  compared  to  adult  population  such  as 
neutropenia  which  was  observed  at  a  significant  higher  frequency  in  paediatric  patients  compared  to 
adult population (90.2 % vs 21%) as well as grade 3/4 neutropenia (63.8% vs 12.3%). It is endorsed 
that the proposed SmPC recommends a specific monitoring for paediatric population. However, a dose 
modification recommendation from a grade 3 neutropenia instead a grade 4 might be warranted. 
In addition, gastro-intestinal toxicity was also observed at a higher frequency in the paediatric population 
compared to the adult population: nausea (82.9% vs 56.6%), diarrhoea (85.4% vs 54.0%) and vomiting 
(95.1 vs 50.8%). Recommendations to manage gastrointestinal toxicities with anti-emetic/anti-diarrhea 
agents  specifically  for  paediatric  population  have  been  added  in  section  4.4  of  the  proposed  SmPC 
considering the higher risk of dehydration in children.  
Furthermore,  elevated  transaminases  were  also  observed  at  a  higher  frequency  in  the  paediatric 
population compared to the adult population (85.4% and 32.1 % respectively). Dose modifications as 
well as the recommendations for monitoring in the SmPC appears sufficient since very frequent.  
Treatment-related AE were reported in 100% of the ALCL and IMT pool population. The most frequent 
treatment related AE pertained to SOC gastrointestinal disorders (Diarrhoea, 75.6%; Vomiting, 92.7%; 
Nausea, 82.9%) hepatobiliary disorders (ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, 82.9%) and blood and lymphatic 
Assessment report

Page 140/149 
 
 
 
system disorders (NEUTROPENIA, 90.2%), LEUKOPENIA (70.7%). The most frequently reported Grade 
3 or 4 treatment-related AE across all 4 pools was NEUTROPENIA (56.1%). 
Except for NEUTROPENIA which was reported twice, each treatment related SAE was reported only once 
(hypoalbuminemia,  blood  creatinine  increase,  kidney  enlargement,  cyanopsia,  infective  myositis,  skin 
infection, tumour lysis syndrome, bradycardia, CPK increase, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting). 
Dosing interruption (70.7%) were more frequent than dose reductions (19.5%). The majority of 
treatment interruption was < 1 week for ALCL pool whereas no such generalisation can be made for 
IMT pool. 
3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data in the targeted population are limited and do not allow for a comprehensive safety 
assessment. This could be acceptable considering the rarity of both disease. Although provided data 
shows a safety profile with similar type of adverse events, differences in frequencies can already be 
observed. It is not clear if the higher exposure of crizotinib observed in children compared to an adult 
population may impact the safety profile, however, preliminary studies suggest an impact on 
neutropenia and vision disorders. 
Concerns remain about the lack of comprehensiveness of safety data regarding the reporting of 
laboratory values of study ADVL0912. Moreover, bone toxicities and bone growth are a particular 
cause of concern. Besides pharmacovigilance reports, a non-clinical signal has been identified and 
evidenced a decrease in bone formation in immature rats. A comprehensive review of all available 
clinical data was provided but due to confounding factors and the limited number of patients treated 
with crizotinib a potential effect on bone could not be ruled out. On this matter, bone toxicity and 
impaired bone growth are monitored in ongoing study CRZ-NBALCL (see RMP). Blood testosterone and 
Tanner are currently monitored in the ongoing CRISP study which will allow further characterisation of 
the impact of crizotinib on puberty (see RMP). 
A DHCP is to be circulated to communicate the safety issue of vision disorders (including risk of severe 
visual loss) and need for monitoring in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory systemic 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or, recurrent, or 
refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive unresectable inflammatory myofibroblastic 
tumour (IMT), at the same time with commission decision for the new indications.

3.7 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Crizotinib is intended to constitute a new targeted therapy for R/R ALK-positive ALCL and R/R or 
unresectable IMT.  
Given the rarity of ALCL and IMT and thus the low number of patients enrolled, and the non-
comparative design of the study, it is hard to draw clear conclusions from a statistical point of view, 
however, results based on the secondary endpoints are considered clinically meaningful and quite 
outstanding. The ORR for the 22 enrolled ALCL patients was 86.4% (95% CI: 66.7, 95.3) for both dose 
level groups. The ORR for the 14 patients in the IMT group was 85.7% (95%CI: 60.1, 96.0) across all 
dose levels. CRs were also high across study groups and remained stable across all age groups, 
despite the absence of patients under the age of 3, also including ALCL patients between 18 and 21.  
The MAH also provided an exhaustive overview of published data from different crizotinib non-
sponsored studies, drawing a parallel with the ADVL0912 pivotal study results. For ALCL patients, the 
results from the French AcSé basket program were presented. Since crizotinib has shown significant 
clinical activity in relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL in small cohorts of patients and in order to avoid a 
generalized off-label use and allow for an equal and nationwide access to crizotinib, the French 
National Cancer Institute (INCa, state organization) launched the AcSé program in patients aged 1 
year and older with advanced ALK+ ALCL. Median age was 21 years and the median number of prior 
chemotherapy lines was 2 including brentuximab in 66% of patients. Among the 15 evaluable patients, 
10 achieved an OR (67%, CI95% [42%-85%]) (9CR, 1PR) and 5 experienced a disease progression. 
The response rate was similar in paediatric patients (67%, CI95% [24%, 94%]) and in adults (6/9, 
67%, CI95% [31%, 91%]) and with a median follow-up of 12 months, the median PFS was 11.6 
months (CI95% [1.41, NA]). A compassionate use program where crizotinib was administered as 
monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients who were resistant/refractory to cytotoxic therapy also 
pointed out very encouraging results as the ORR was of 90.9%; (95%CI = 58.7% to 99.8%). Efficacy 
results obtained within the small cohorts of patients treated for IMT report comparable ORR even 
though the 2018 results presented by the MAH for the EORTC 90101 CREATE study are not up to date 
Assessment report

since the final analysis as of data cut-off on 28th January 2021 describe an ORR reaching 66.7% (95% 
CI 34.9-90.1%) in ALK+ IMT patients and a 3-year OS rates of 83.3% (95% CI 48.2-95.6). Altogether, 
these results are in line with the ADVL0912 pivotal study findings and are considered highly 
supportive. With regards to the ongoing supportive study A8081013, five paediatric patients were 
enrolled at data cut-off date. Efficacy results are as well consistent with those reported in the pivotal 
study.  
Efforts made by the MAH in order to collect and analyse the audit findings following CHMP request are 
acknowledged and valued.  It should be noted that the findings are more qualifying to "deficiencies" 
than protocol deviations that can be collected in a more standardized trial. In one hand and since the 
search for such information was done retrospectively, the MAH states that it has been done "to the 
extent possible", which can lead to some bias in the analysis. On the other hand, when assessing the 
list of major deviations with a potential impact on efficacy, which was the major concern, none of the 
deviations appears to question study results. 
Since no Pfizer-sponsored studies in adults and in paediatric patients are planned or ongoing with 
crizotinib monotherapy in the claimed indications and in order to address the identified data, the MAH 
proposed to implement PAMs requested by the FDA to further assess the PK and efficacy of crizotinib 
at 165 mg/m2 BID and secondly at 280 mg/m2 BID in paediatric patients. ALK+ IMT Patients can thus 
be enrolled at the 280 mg/m² BID, as Study ITCC 053 plans to recruit at least 15 paediatric patients 
with ALK, ROS1 or MET mutations in the stratum 3. Patients with ALK+ rr ALCL can be enrolled in 
stratum 3 once stratum 1b (at 165 mg/m² BID) is completed. As requested in the previous round, 
these additional ongoing studies are added in the RMP and the results planned with reasonable 
timelines.  
With respect to DR which was quite underestimated in the ALCL group because of 10 patients who 
proceeded to HSCT (censored at time of HSCT), a longer median DR was observed for ALCL patients 
who did not receive a HSCT and IMT patients, and very rapid responses were observed in the ALCL 
group with a median TTR of ~1 month (280 mg/m2 BID) for both indications. However, it should be 
noted that a complementary analysis presenting DR results with censoring rules according to the EMA 
guideline was requested but unresolved since EMA censoring methods couldn’t be implemented for the 
pivotal study ADVL0912 with no complementary sensitivity nor supportive applicable analyses.  
The MAH discussed in depth the 5 literature references provided describing two abrupt relapses cases 
from which one patient was switched to ceritinib with rapid clinical improvement and a durable CR. The 
other patient resumed crizotinib and remained in CR. There was an additional case of a patient 
progressing while receiving crizotinib, the MAH broadly discussed this case which was not an abrupt 
but a relapse one. The data provided regarding abrupt relapses in ALCL and IMT patients are limited at 
this time and definitely need more characterization since the mechanism is not known yet. Minimum 
inhibition duration and thus treatment duration to avoid such early relapses after treatment 
discontinuation also need to be better characterized. It is highly recommended that the MAH closely 
monitors documented abrupt relapses cases in the PSURs.  
Lastly, two different formulations were used within the submitted studies including the oral solution 
which is not available on the market. The MAH agreed that the commercially available capsules are 
highly unsuitable for the 1-6 years old population, in which swallowing issues are very likely to occur. 
An efficacy analysis by formulation was also provided but no clear conclusions regarding formulation-
effect could be drawn for efficacy parameters compared to the previously assessed pooled data 
considering the very limited number of patients especially for the oral solution group (6 each in the 
ALCL and the IMT group). It should be noted that a paediatric microsphere encapsulated formulation is 
under development with 3 strengths: 20 mg, 50 mg, and 150 mg and a variation is planned for Q2 
2023 in order to seek the line extension.

Crizotinib showed a safety profile mainly related to gastrointestinal, hepatic, haematological and renal 
toxicity. These AE were observed in adult population at lower frequencies. Similar severities were 
observed except for neutropenia grade 3/4 observed at a notable higher frequency in paediatric 
patients. Additional monitoring and management of these AE are provided in the SmPC of Xalkori with 
adaptation for paediatric population when required, however amendments of dose modification 
recommendations may be needed. 
Visual disorders were observed in the paediatric population similarly to adult population; following a 
request, the MAH added specific monitoring and additional management recommendations in the 
SmPC. 
Concerns about bone toxicities and impaired bone growth in the paediatric population will be addressed 
in ongoing study CRZ-NBALCL. In addition, the safety concern “bone toxicities and impaired bone 
growth” has been added in the RMP as important potential risk in the RMP  
Furthermore, blood testosterone decrease which is a known adverse reaction of Xalkori in adult was 
not observed in paediatric population during the clinical trials submitted for this application. However, 
blood testosterone as well as Tanner stage are currently monitored in the ongoing study CRISP 
proposed as PAM provided favourable outcome of the CHMP which will allow further characterisation of 
the impact of crizotinib on puberty. 
Overall, Xalkori toxicity appears clinically manageable provided additional measures. Although the 
safety database remains limited, the evaluation of the additional requested data and the 
implementation of monitoring and management of key toxicities have resolved number of uncertainties 
on the safety profile of Xalkori. 
3.7.2 Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the original indication for crizotinib to include treatment of paediatric 
patients (age ≥ 6 to < 18 years) with R/R ALK- ALCL and with unresectable, R/R ALK-positive IMT. 
The conclusions of the CHMP are based on the results of a single non-comparative pivotal study and one 
supportive study. Data obtained from historical comparator studies were also submitted to assist with 
the interpretation of efficacy data from the single-arm studies.  
Around 20 patients require a relapse-therapy each year in Europe. Given the rarity of ALCL and IMT and 
thus  the  low  number of  patients  enrolled,  and  the non-comparative  design of  the  study,  it  is  hard  to 
draw conclusions from a statistical point of view. Moreover, efficacy analysis were only considered as 
secondary  endpoints  in  the  pivotal  study.  This  being  said,  the  reported  efficacy  results  are  very 
encouraging  and  quite  outstanding.  The  ORR  for  the  22  enrolled  ALCL  patients  was  86.4%  (95%  CI: 
66.7,  95.3)  for  both  dose  levels  groups.  The  ORR  for  the  14  patients  in  the  IMT  group  was  85.7% 
(95%CI: 60.1, 96.0) across all dose levels. CRs were also high across study groups and remained stable 
across all age groups, despite the absence of patients under the age of 3, also including ALCL patients 
between 18 and 21. With regards to the ongoing supportive study A8081013, five paediatric patients 
were  enrolled  at  data  cut-off  date.  Efficacy  results  are  as  well  consistent  with  those  reported  in  the 
pivotal study.  
With  respect  to  DR  which  was  quite  underestimated  in  the  ALCL  group  because  of  10  patients  who 
proceeded to HSCT, a longer median DR was observed for ALCL patients who did not receive a HSCT 
and IMT patients, and very rapid responses were observed in the ALCL group with a median TTR of ~1 
month  (280  mg/m2  BID)  for  both  indications.  It  should  be  noted  that  a  complementary  analysis 
presenting DR results with censoring rules according to the EMA guideline was not possible since EMA 
censoring  methods  couldn’t  be  implemented  for  the  pivotal  study  ADVL0912  with  no  complementary 
sensitivity nor supportive applicable analyses.

As  part  of  establishing  the  positive  B/R  balance  for  crizotinib  in  the  two  claimed  indications  among 
paediatric patients, the MAH provided an exhaustive overview of published data from different crizotinib 
non-sponsored studies, drawing a parallel with the ADVL0912 pivotal study results. For ALCL patients, 
the MAH elaborates on the results from the French AcSé program. The AcSé program was launched in 
patients aged 1 year and older with advanced ALK+ ALCL. Median age was 21 years and the median 
number  of  prior  chemotherapy  lines  was  2  including  brentuximab  in  66%  of  patients.  Among  the  15 
evaluable  patients,  10  achieved  an  OR  (67%,  CI95%  [42%-85%])  (9CR,  1PR)  and  5  experienced  a 
disease progression. The response rate was similar in paediatric patients (67%, CI95% [24%, 94%]) 
and in adults (6/9, 67%, CI95% [31%, 91%]) and with a median follow-up of 12 months, the median 
PFS  was  11.6  months  (CI95%  [1.41,  NA]).  A  compassionate  use  program  where  crizotinib  was 
administered as monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients who were resistant/refractory to cytotoxic 
therapy  also  pointed  out  very  encouraging  results  as  the  ORR  was  of  90.9%;  (95%CI  =  58.7%  to 
99.8%).  Efficacy  results  obtained  within  the  small  cohorts  of  patients  treated  for  IMT  also  report 
comparable ORR even though the 2018’s results presented by the MAH for the EORTC 90101 CREATE 
study are not up to date since the final analysis as of data cut-off on 28th January 2021 describe an ORR 
reaching 66.7% (95% CI 34.9-90.1%) in ALK+ IMT patients and a 3-year OS rates of 83.3% (95% CI 
48.2-95.6).  Altogether,  these  results  are  in  line  with  the  ADVL0912  pivotal  study  findings  and  are 
considered highly supportive.  
Although the safety database remains limited, crizotinib toxicity appears clinically manageable 
considering recommendations of monitoring and management implemented for paediatric patients in 
the SmPC. The healthcare professionals are alerted to the risk of ocular toxicities via a DHPC. 
3.7.3 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A divergent view was expressed by a CHMP member as follows: 
We consider that the rationale for ALK targeting of these very rare ALK-positive tumours and the anti-
tumour activity of crizotinib in the studied paediatric population is clear. However, in our view the data 
are of insufficient quality to serve as an adequate basis for B/R assessment. The concerns relate to 
amongst others the small sample size, the inadequate collection of baseline characteristics, and events 
during follow-up, e.g. response assessment following hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in this 
heterogeneous target populations. As a result the study populations are not well described and the 
duration of response cannot be estimated. The alternative approach, being extrapolation, cannot be 
applied in the absence of approved indications in the adult IMT and ALCL setting. With the notion that 
paediatric data need to be interpreted against the same standards as those obtained in adults and any 
deviation from such standards should only be considered when justified (as per e.g. the Guideline on 
small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005)); in our view the benefit is not established based on the 
submitted data, rendering the B/R negative and this extension of indication non-approvable. 
3.8 Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xalkori in the treatment of paediatric patients (age ≥ 6 to < 18 years) with relapsed 
or refractory systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
(ALCL) and with recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive unresectable inflammatory myofibroblastic 
tumour (IMT) is positive.

Leaflet is updated in accordance. The Annex II was updated to include key elements of the 
educational material as additional risk minimisation measures. Version 8.2 of the RMP has also been 
submitted.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall agree the content and format of the educational material with the National Competent 
Authority. The final wording used on the educational material should be in line with the approved 
product information. 
The MAH should ensure that, at launch and thereafter, all Healthcare Professionals who are expected 
to use and/or prescribe XALKORI are provided with an educational pack. 
The educational pack should contain the following: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Patient brochure including a Patient Alert Card (text as agreed by the CHMP). 
Patient Card (text as agreed by the CHMP). 
The Patient Information brochure should contain the following key elements: 
- 
- 
- 
Brief introduction to crizotinib and the purpose of the risk minimisation tools. 
Information on how to take crizotinib, including what to do if a dose is missed

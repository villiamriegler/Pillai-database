CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Tezspire is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus 
another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
asthma.
Posology
Adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older)
The recommended dose is 210 mg of tezepelumab by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. 
Tezspire is intended for long-term treatment. A decision to continue the therapy should be made at 
least annually based on the patient's level of asthma control.
2
Missed dose
If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, the patient can 
resume dosing on the scheduled day of administration. If the next dose is already due, then administer 
as planned. A double dose must not be administered.
Special populations
Elderly (≥65 years of age)
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Renal and hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Tezspire in children under 12 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available.
Method of administration 
Tezspire is administered as a subcutaneous injection.
A patient may self-inject or the patient’s caregiver may administer this medicinal product after training 
in subcutaneous injection technique. Proper training should be provided to patients and/or caregivers 
on the preparation and administration of Tezspire prior to use according to the “Instructions for Use”. 
Tezspire should be injected into the thigh or abdomen, except for the 5 cm around the navel. If a 
healthcare professional or caregiver administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. A 
patient should not self-inject in the arm. It should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, 
bruised, erythematous, or hardened. It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection.
Comprehensive instructions for administration using the pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen is provided 
in the “Instructions for Use”.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Acute asthma exacerbations
Tezspire should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations.
Asthma-related symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be instructed 
to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment.
Corticosteroids 
Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of therapy is not recommended. Reduction in 
corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the supervision of a 
physician.
3
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, rash) may occur following administration of tezepelumab
(see section 4.8). These reactions may occur within hours of administration, but in some instances 
have a delayed onset (i.e. days).
A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to tezepelumab may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following 
Tezspire administration. In line with clinical practice, patients should be monitored for an appropriate 
time after administration of Tezspire.
In the event of a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis), administration of tezepelumab 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment as clinically indicated should be 
initiated.
Serious infections
Blocking thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may theoretically increase the risk of serious 
infections. In placebo-controlled studies, no increase in serious infections was observed with 
tezepelumab.
Patients with pre-existing serious infections should be treated before initiating therapy with 
tezepelumab. If patients develop a serious infection while receiving tezepelumab treatment, therapy 
with tezepelumab should be discontinued until the serious infection resolves.
Serious cardiac events
In a long-term clinical study, a numerical imbalance in serious cardiac adverse events was observed in 
patients treated with tezepelumab compared to placebo. No causal relationship between tezepelumab 
and these events has been established, nor has a patient population at risk of these events been 
identified.
Patients should be advised of signs or symptoms suggestive of a cardiac event (for example, chest 
pain, dyspnoea, malaise, feeling lightheaded or faint) and to seek immediate medical attention if such 
symptoms occur. If patients develop a serious cardiac event while receiving tezepelumab treatment, 
therapy with tezepelumab should be discontinued until the acute event stabilises.
There is currently no data on re-treatment of patients who develop a serious cardiac event or serious 
infection.
Parasitic (helminth) infection
TSLP may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with 
known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical trials. It is unknown if 
tezepelumab may influence a patient’s response against helminth infections.
Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating therapy with
tezepelumab. If patients become infected while receiving treatment and do not respond to anti-
helminth treatment, therapy with tezepelumab should be discontinued until infection resolves.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 210 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving tezepelumab.
In a randomised, double blind, parallel group study of 70 patients aged between 12 and 21 years with 
moderate to severe asthma, tezepelumab treatment did not appear to affect the humoral antibody 
responses induced by seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccination.
A clinically relevant effect of tezepelumab on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered asthma 
medicinal products is not expected. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, commonly 
co-administered asthma medicinal products (including leukotriene receptor antagonists, 
theophylline/aminophylline and oral corticosteroids) had no effect on tezepelumab clearance.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
tezepelumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Human IgG antibodies, such as tezepelumab, are transported across the placenta barrier; therefore, 
Tezspire may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus.
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tezspire during pregnancy unless the 
expected benefit to the pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether tezepelumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period.
For this specific period, a decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from tezepelumab 
therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of therapy to the 
woman.
Afterwards, tezepelumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.
See section 5.3 for information on the excretion of tezepelumab in animal (cynomolgus monkey) milk.
Fertility
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of tezepelumab 
treatment on fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tezspire has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions
Injection site reactions
In the pooled safety data from PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR, injection site reactions (e.g. injection 
site erythema, injection site swelling, injection site pain) occurred at a rate of 3.8% in patients treated 
with tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks (Q4W).
Paediatric population
A total of 82 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with severe, uncontrolled asthma were enrolled in the 52 week 
Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study (see section 5.1). The safety profile in adolescents was generally similar 
to the overall study population.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
6
4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials, doses of up to 280 mg were administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 
doses of up to 700 mg were administered intravenously every 4 weeks (Q4W) to patients with asthma 
without evidence of dose-related toxicities.
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with tezepelumab. If overdose occurs, the patient should 
be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX11
Mechanism of action
Tezepelumab is a monoclonal antibody (IgG2λ) directed against thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
(TSLP), preventing its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. In asthma, both allergic and 
non-allergic triggers induce TSLP production. Blocking TSLP with tezepelumab reduces a broad 
spectrum of biomarkers and cytokines associated with airway inflammation (e.g. blood eosinophils,
airway submucosal eosinophils, IgE, FeNO, IL-5, and IL-13); however, the mechanism of action of 
tezepelumab in asthma has not been definitively established. 
Pharmacodynamic effects
Effect on blood eosinophils and inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines
In clinical trials, administration of tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks reduced blood 
eosinophils counts, FeNO, IL-5 concentration, IL-13 concentration and serum IgE concentration from 
baseline compared with placebo. These markers were near maximal suppression after 2 weeks of 
treatment, except for IgE which declined more slowly. These effects were sustained throughout 
treatment.
Effect on eosinophils in the airway submucosa
In a clinical trial, administration of tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks reduced 
submucosal eosinophil counts by 89% compared with a 25% reduction with placebo. Reduction was 
consistent regardless of baseline inflammatory biomarkers.
Immunogenicity
In NAVIGATOR, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected at any time in 26 (4.9%) out of 
527 patients who received tezepelumab at the recommended dosing regimen during the 52-week study 
period. Of these 26 patients, 10 patients (1.9% of patients treated with tezepelumab) developed 
treatment-emergent ADA and 1 patient (0.2% of patients treated with tezepelumab) developed 
neutralising antibodies. ADA titres were generally low and often transient. No evidence of ADA
impact on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, or safety was observed.
Clinical efficacy
The efficacy of tezepelumab was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-
controlled clinical trials (PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR) of 52 weeks in duration involving a total of 
1609 patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma. In both trials, patients were enrolled 
without requiring a minimum baseline level of blood eosinophils or other inflammatory biomarkers 
(e.g. FeNO or IgE).
7
PATHWAY was a 52-week exacerbation trial which enrolled 550 patients (18 years of age and older) 
with severe, uncontrolled asthma to receive treatment with tezepelumab 70 mg subcutaneous Q4W, 
tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W, tezepelumab 280 mg subcutaneous Q2W or placebo. 
Patients were required to have a history of 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic 
corticosteroid treatment or 1 asthma exacerbation resulting in hospitalisation in the past 12 months.
NAVIGATOR was a 52-week exacerbation trial which enrolled a total of 1061 patients (adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older) with severe, uncontrolled asthma to receive treatment with 
tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W or placebo. Patients were required to have a history of 2 or 
more asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment or resulting in 
hospitalisation in the past 12 months.
In both PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR, patients were required to have an Asthma Control 
Questionnaire 6 (ACQ-6) score of 1.5 or more at screening, and reduced lung function at baseline 
(pre-bronchodilator FEV1 below 80% predicted in adults, and below 90% predicted in adolescents). 
Patients were required to have been on regular treatment with medium- or high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one additional asthma control therapy with or without oral 
corticosteroids (OCS). High ICS dose was defined as > 500 mcg fluticasone propionate or equivalent 
per day. Medium ICS dose was defined as > 250 to 500 mcg fluticasone propionate or equivalent per 
day in PATHWAY and as 500 mcg fluticasone propionate or equivalent per day in NAVIGATOR. 
Patients continued background asthma therapy throughout the duration of the trials.
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these two trials are provided in Table 2 below.

The results summarised below are for the recommended tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W 
dosing regimen.
Exacerbations
The primary endpoint for PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR was the rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
measured over 52 weeks. Severe asthma exacerbations were defined as worsening of asthma requiring 
the use of or increase in oral or systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or a single depo-injection of 
corticosteroids, and/or emergency department visits requiring use of oral or systemic corticosteroids 
and/or hospitalisation.
In both PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR, patients receiving tezepelumab had significant reductions in 
the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations compared with placebo (Table 3 and Table 4). 
There were also fewer exacerbations requiring emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation in patients 
treated with tezepelumab compared with placebo. In PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR, severe asthma 
exacerbations requiring emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation were reduced by 85% and 79% 
with tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W, respectively.

Subgroup analysis 
In NAVIGATOR, tezepelumab demonstrated a reduction in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations 
regardless of the baseline levels of blood eosinophils, FeNO, as well as allergic status (determined by 
a perennial aeroallergen specific IgE). Similar results were seen in PATHWAY. See 
Figure 1.
In NAVIGATOR, reductions in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations were greater with increasing 
baseline blood eosinophil counts and FeNO values (rate ratio = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.48, 1.28] for patients 
with both baseline blood eosinophil count < 150 cells/µL and baseline FeNO < 25 ppb; rate ratio = 
0.30 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.40] for patients with both baseline blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/µL and 
baseline FeNO ≥ 25 ppb).

Lung function 
Change from baseline in FEV1 was assessed as a secondary endpoint in NAVIGATOR. Compared 
with placebo, tezepelumab provided clinically meaningful improvements in the mean change from 
baseline in FEV1 (Table 5).

Patient reported outcomes
Changes from baseline in ACQ-6, Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for ages 12 and 
older [AQLQ(S)+12] and weekly mean Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) scores were assessed as 
secondary endpoints in NAVIGATOR. Severity of wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest 
tightness were assessed twice daily (morning and evening). Night-time awakening and activity were 
assessed on a daily basis. The total ASD score was calculated as the mean of 10 items (Table 5).
Improvements in ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S)+12 were seen as early as 2 weeks and 4 weeks after 
administration of tezepelumab, respectively, and sustained through week 52 in both trials.

Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age)
Of the 665 patients with asthma exposed to tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W in PATHWAY 
and NAVIGATOR, a total of 119 patients were 65 years of age or older, of which 32 patients were 
75 years of age or older. Safety in these age groups were similar to the overall study population. 
Efficacy in these age groups were similar to the overall study population in NAVIGATOR. 
11
PATHWAY did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine efficacy in 
this age group.
Paediatric population
A total of 82 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with severe, uncontrolled asthma were enrolled in 
NAVIGATOR and received treatment with tezepelumab (n=41) or placebo (n=41). Of the 
41 adolescents receiving treatment with tezepelumab, 15 were taking high-dose ICS at baseline. The 
annualised asthma exacerbation rate observed in adolescents treated with tezepelumab was 0.68 versus 
0.97 for placebo (rate ratio 0.70; 95% CI 0.34, 1.46). The LS mean change from baseline for FEV1
observed in adolescents treated with tezepelumab was 0.44 L versus 0.27 L for placebo (LS mean 
difference 0.17 L; 95% CI -0.01, 0.35). The pharmacodynamic responses in adolescents were
generally similar to the overall study population.
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tezspire in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab were dose-proportional following subcutaneous administration 
over a dose range of 2.1 mg to 420 mg.
Absorption
Following a single subcutaneous administration, the maximum serum concentration was reached in 
approximately 3 to 10 days. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated absolute 
bioavailability was approximately 77%. There was no clinically relevant difference in bioavailability 
when administered to different injection sites (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm).
Distribution
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, central and peripheral volume of distribution of 
tezepelumab were 3.9 L and 2.2 L, respectively, for a 70 kg individual.
Metabolism
Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2λ) that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes 
widely distributed in the body and not metabolised by hepatic enzymes.
Elimination
As a human monoclonal antibody, tezepelumab is eliminated by intracellular catabolism and there is 
no evidence of target-mediated clearance. From population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated 
clearance for tezepelumab was 0.17 L/d for a 70 kg individual. The elimination half-life was 
approximately 26 days. 
Special populations
Age, gender, race
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, gender and race had no clinically meaningful 
effects on the pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab.
12
Body weight
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, higher body weight was associated with lower 
exposure. However, the effect of body weight on exposure had no meaningful impact on efficacy or 
safety and does not require dose adjustment.
Paediatric patients
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no clinically meaningful age-related 
difference in the pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab between adults and adolescents aged 12 to 
17 years. Tezepelumab has not been studied in children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Elderly patients (≥65 years of age)
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no clinically meaningful difference in the 
pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients.
Renal impairment
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on 
tezepelumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, tezepelumab clearance was similar in 
patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to < 90 mL/min), moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to < 60 mL/min) and those with normal renal function (creatinine 
clearance ≥ 90 mL/min). Tezepelumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min); however, tezepelumab is not cleared renally.
Hepatic impairment
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on 
tezepelumab. IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathway; change in 
hepatic function is not expected to influence tezepelumab clearance. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, baseline hepatic function biomarkers (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) had no 
effect on tezepelumab clearance.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity studies 
including safety pharmacology and fertility evaluations, and an ePPND (enhanced Pre- and Post-Natal 
Development) reproductive toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 300 mg/kg/week 
(producing exposures of greater than 100-times the clinical exposure at maximum recommended

6. Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Tezspire is and what it is used for
What Tezspire is and how it works
Tezspire contains the active substance tezepelumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are 
proteins that recognise and bind to a specific target substance in the body, which in the case of 
tezepelumab is a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP plays a key role in 
causing the inflammation in your airways that leads to the signs and symptoms of asthma. By blocking 
the action of TSLP, this medicine helps to reduce inflammation and asthma symptoms. 
What Tezspire is used for
Tezspire is used with other asthma medicines to treat severe asthma in adults and adolescents 
(12 years of age and older) when the disease is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. 
How Tezspire can help
Tezspire may reduce the number of asthma attacks you experience, improve your breathing and reduce 
your asthma symptoms. 
2. What you need to know before you use Tezspire
Do not use Tezspire

if you are allergic to tezepelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If this applies to you, or if you are not sure, check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tezspire.
36



Tezspire is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
If your asthma is not getting any better, or it gets worse during treatment with this medicine, 
talk to a doctor or nurse.
Look out for signs of allergic reactions. Medicines like Tezspire can potentially cause serious 
allergic reactions in some people. The signs of these reactions may vary, but can include
swelling of your face, tongue or mouth, breathing problems, fast heartbeat, fainting, dizziness, 
feeling lightheaded, hives and rash. If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse 
immediately.
Talk to your doctor about how to recognise early signs of allergy, and how to manage reactions 
if they occur.

Look out for any signs of a possible serious infection while you are taking Tezspire such as:
fever, flu-like symptoms, night sweats;
cough which will not go away;
-
-
- warm, red and painful skin, or a painful skin rash with blisters. 
If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.
If you already have a serious infection, talk to your doctor before taking Tezspire.

Look out for any symptoms of a heart problem, such as:
-
-
-
-
chest pain;
shortness of breath;
a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being;
feeling lightheaded or faint.
If you notice any of these symptoms, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.

If you have a parasitic infection or if you live in (or travel to) an area where parasitic 
infections are common, talk to your doctor. Tezspire may weaken your body’s ability to fight 
certain types of parasitic infections.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in children in this age group.
Other medicines for asthma

Do not suddenly stop taking your other asthma medicines when you start Tezspire. This is 
especially important if you take steroids (also called corticosteroids). These medicines must be 
stopped gradually, under the supervision of your doctor and based on your response to Tezspire.
Other medicines and Tezspire
Tell your doctor or pharmacist:


if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines.
if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 

Do not use Tezspire during pregnancy unless your doctor advises it. It is not known if Tezspire
can harm your unborn baby.
Tezspire may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your 
doctor.

37
Driving and using machines
Tezspire is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Tezspire contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 210 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.
How to use Tezspire
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over:

The recommended dose is 210 mg (1 injection) every 4 weeks. Tezspire is given as an 
injection under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Your doctor or nurse will decide if you can inject yourself or if your caregiver can do that for you. If 
so, you or your caregiver will receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Tezspire. 
Before injecting Tezspire yourself, carefully read the ‘Instructions for Use’ for Tezspire pre-filled 
syringe. Do this each time you get another injection. There may be new information.
Do not share Tezspire pre-filled syringes or use a syringe more than one time.
If you forget to use Tezspire

If you have forgotten to inject a dose, inject a dose as soon as possible. Then have your next 
injection on your next scheduled injection day.
If you did not notice that you missed a dose until it is time for your next dose, simply inject the 
next dose as scheduled. Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you are not sure when to inject Tezspire, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.


If you stop using Tezspire

Do not stop using Tezspire without speaking first to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Interrupting or stopping the treatment with Tezspire may cause your asthma symptoms and 
attacks to come back.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

You may see small air bubbles in the liquid. This is normal. You 
do not need to do anything about it.

1. What Tezspire is and what it is used for
What Tezspire is and how it works
Tezspire contains the active substance tezepelumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are 
proteins that recognise and bind to a specific target substance in the body, which in the case of 
tezepelumab is a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP plays a key role in 
causing the inflammation in your airways that leads to the signs and symptoms of asthma. By blocking 
the action of TSLP, this medicine helps to reduce inflammation and asthma symptoms. 
What Tezspire is used for
Tezspire is used with other asthma medicines to treat severe asthma in adults and adolescents 
(12 years of age and older) when the disease is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. 
How Tezspire can help
Tezspire may reduce the number of asthma attacks you experience, improve your breathing and reduce 
your asthma symptoms. 
2. What you need to know before you use Tezspire
Do not use Tezspire

if you are allergic to tezepelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If this applies to you, or if you are not sure, check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tezspire.
47



Tezspire is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack. 
If your asthma is not getting any better, or it gets worse during treatment with this medicine, 
talk to a doctor or nurse.
Look out for signs of allergic reactions. Medicines like Tezspire can potentially cause serious
allergic reactions in some people. The signs of these reactions may vary, but can include
swelling of your face, tongue, or mouth, breathing problems, fast heartbeat, fainting, dizziness, 
feeling lightheaded, hives and rash. If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse 
immediately.
Talk to your doctor about how to recognise early signs of allergy, and how to manage reactions 
if they occur.

Look out for any signs of a possible serious infection while you are taking Tezspire such as:
fever, flu-like symptoms, night sweats;
cough which will not go away;
-
-
- warm, red and painful skin, or a painful skin rash with blisters. 
If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.
If you already have a serious infection, talk to your doctor before taking Tezspire.

Look out for any symptoms of a heart problem, such as:
-
-
-
-
chest pain;
shortness of breath;
a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being;
feeling lightheaded or faint.
If you notice any of these symptoms, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.

If you have a parasitic infection or if you live in (or travel to) an area where parasitic 
infections are common, talk to your doctor. Tezspire may weaken your body’s ability to fight 
certain types of parasitic infections.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in children in this age group.
Other medicines for asthma

Do not suddenly stop taking your other asthma medicines when you start Tezspire. This is 
especially important if you take steroids (also called corticosteroids). These medicines must be 
stopped gradually, under the supervision of your doctor and based on your response to Tezspire.
Other medicines and Tezspire

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 

Do not use Tezspire during pregnancy unless your doctor advises it. It is not known if Tezspire 
can harm your unborn baby.
Tezspire may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your 
doctor.

Step 7 – Inject Tezspire
Follow your healthcare provider’s instruction on how to inject. 
You can either gently pinch the skin at the injection site or give 
the injection without pinching the skin.
Inject Tezspire by following the steps in figures a, b, c and d.
When injecting, you will hear the first click that tells you the 
injection has started. Press and hold the pre-filled pen for 15 
seconds until you hear the second click.
Do not change the position of the pre-filled pen after the injection 
has started.

move down in the viewing 
window during the injection.
Hold down firmly for about 
15 seconds.
 You will hear a second
‘click’, this tells you the

slide down and lock into 
place over the needle.
Step 8 – Check the viewing window
Check the viewing window to make sure all the medicine has been 
injected.
If the orange plunger rod does not fill the viewing window, you 
may not have received the full dose.
If this happens or if you have any other concerns, contact your 
healthcare provider.

Step 9 – Check the injection site
There may be a small amount of blood or liquid where you 
injected. This is normal.
Gently hold pressure over your skin with a cotton ball or gauze 
until the bleeding stops.
Do not rub the injection site. If needed, cover the injection site 
with a small bandage.
Disposing of Tezspire
Step 10 – Dispose of the used pre-filled pen safely
Each pre-filled pen contains a single dose of Tezspire and cannot 
be used again. Do not put the cap back on the pre-filled pen.

container right away after use. Put other used supplies in your 
household trash.
Do not throw away the pre-filled pen in your household trash.

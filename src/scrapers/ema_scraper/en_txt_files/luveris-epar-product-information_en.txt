4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Luveris in association with a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation is indicated for the 
stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe luteinising hormone (LH) and FSH 
deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Luveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Posology 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Luveris therapy in association with FSH is to 
promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Luveris should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously 
with FSH. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can 
commence at any time. 
Luveris should be administered concomitantly with follitropin alfa. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa (i.e. one vial of Luveris) daily with 75 
to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by 
measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In clinical trials, Luveris has been shown to increase the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa. If an 
FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 IU to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 IU to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The 
patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be 
performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4.). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of Luveris in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of Luveris in elderly 
patients have not been established. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Luveris in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not 
been established. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Luveris in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Luveris should be performed under 
direct medical supervision. The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the 
solvent provided. Self-administration of this medicinal product should only be performed by patients 
who are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In addition, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Porphyria 
In patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria Luveris may increase the risk of an acute 
attack. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
Mild manifestations of OHSS may include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort and distension, or 
enlarged ovaries. Moderate OHSS may additionally present with nausea, vomiting, ultrasound 
evidence of ascites or marked ovarian enlargement. 
Severe OHSS further includes symptoms such as severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea 
or oliguria. Clinical evaluation may reveal signs such as hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, 
electrolyte imbalances, ascites, pleural effusions, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe 
OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary 
embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended Luveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise the 
risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as 
estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. As OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event, patients should be followed 
for at least two weeks after hCG administration. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing and that the patient be hospitalised and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated 
with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian 
torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of higher order multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is 
recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related 
mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Congenital malformations 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This could be due to parental factors (e.g. maternal age, genetics), ART procedures and 
multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity 
(body mass index > 30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for 
aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration 
need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself, as well as 
OHSS, also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women. 
Sodium content 
Luveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, 
except follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter 
the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for the use of Luveris during pregnancy. 
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of gonadotropins on 
pregnancy, embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following 
controlled ovarian stimulation. No teratogenic effect of Luveris has been observed in animal studies. 
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
Luveris. 
Breast-feeding 
Luveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Luveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development, in association with FSH (see 
section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Luveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Luveris is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alfa. In this 
context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used. 
In a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or 
swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site 
reactions were reported. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was observed in less than 6% of patients treated with 
Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported (see section 4.4). 
In rare instances, adnexal torsion (a complication of ovarian enlargement), and haemoperitoneum have 
been associated with human menopausal gonadotropin therapy. Although these adverse reactions were 
not observed, there is the possibility that they may also occur with Luveris. 
Ectopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may 
occur (see section 4.4). 
Single doses of up to 40 000 IU of lutropin alfa have been administered to healthy female volunteers 
without serious adverse reactions and were well tolerated. 
Management 
Treatment is directed to symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA07 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and play a complementary role 
in follicle development and ovulation. In theca cells, LH stimulates the secretion of androgens that are 
transferred to granulosa cells to be converted to estradiol (E2) by aromatase. In granulosa cells, FSH 
stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, 
steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The primary effect resulting from administration of r-hLH is a dose-related increase of E2 secretion, 
enhancing the effect of FSH administration on follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy 
In clinical trials, patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a 
central laboratory. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 70 to 75%. However, it should be 
taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different 
laboratories. 
In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH 
concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH 
daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and estrogen 
production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient 
follicular development. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of lutropin alfa have been studied in pituitary desensitised female volunteers 
from 75 IU up to 40 000 IU. The pharmacokinetic profile of lutropin alfa is similar to that of 
endogenous LH. 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of 
approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 9 to 11 hours. 
The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 5 to 14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear 
pharmacokinetics, as assessed by area under curve (AUC) which is directly proportional to the dose 
administered. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 56% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 8 to 21 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 450 IU. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated 
administration of Luveris are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. 
Elimination 
Total body clearance is around 1.8 L/h and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. As expected from the 
heterologous protein nature of the hormone, lutropin alfa raised an antibody response in experimental 
animals after a period that reduced the measurable serum LH levels but did not fully prevent its 
biological action. No signs of toxicity due to the development of antibodies to lutropin alfa were 
observed. 
At doses of 10 IU/kg/day and greater, repeated administration of lutropin alfa to pregnant rats and 
rabbits caused impairment of reproductive function including resorption of foetuses and reduced body 
weight gain of the dams. However, drug-related teratogenesis was not observed in either animal 
model. 
Other studies have shown that lutropin alfa is not mutagenic.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Luveris is and what it is used for 
What Luveris is 
Luveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant Luteinising Hormone (LH) which is 
essentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology. 
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotropins, which are involved in the normal control of 
reproduction. 
What Luveris is used for 
Luveris is recommended for the treatment of adult women who have been shown to produce very low 
levels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle. The medicine is used 
together with another hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone, (FSH), to bring about the 
development of follicles, which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova). It is followed 
by treatment with a single dose of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to the release 
of an egg from the follicle (ovulation). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Luveris 
Do not use Luveris 
• 
if you are allergic to gonadotropins (such as luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone 
or human chorionic gonadotropin), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have cancer of ovaries, uterus or breast. 
if you have had a brain tumour diagnosed. 
if you have ovarian enlargement or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cyst) of unknown 
origin. 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use Luveris if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using this medicine. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Luveris. 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started. 
It is recommended not to use Luveris if you have any condition that usually makes a normal 
pregnancy impossible, such as ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian 
failure, or malformations of sexual organs. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome or OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see section 4 under “Serious side effects”). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Luveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. This 
becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
Chorionic Gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see section 3 under “How much to use” for details). If 
you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may 
be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days. 
Your doctor will ensure careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
sampling before and during the course of treatment. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Luveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Luveris at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technologies, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technologies or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy where the embryo 
is implanted outside the womb), whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with 
fertility treatments. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Luveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots 
in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots 
or existing clots might become worse with Luveris treatment. 
Tumours of sexual organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Birth defects 
Birth defects after assisted reproductive technologies may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This could be due to differences in parental factors like maternal age, genetics, as well as 
the assisted reproductive technology procedures and multiple pregnancy. 
Children and adolescents 
Luveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Luveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Do not use Luveris as a mixture with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, 
if prescribed by your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Luveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Luveris contains sodium 
Luveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium free”. 
3. 
How to use Luveris 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Using this medicine 
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for 
you during this course of treatment. 
More user-friendly presentations are available for self-administration by patients at home. Consult 
your doctor to find out if a more suitable alternative may be available for you. 
How much to use 
Luveris is usually used every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH. 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose is 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH. 
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably 37.5 to 
75 IU at 7- to 14-day intervals. 
Your physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks. 
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24 to 48 hours after 
the last injections of Luveris and FSH. You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, 
and the day following, administration of the hCG. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4 
under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor will 
prescribe FSH at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin. Each vial 
is for single use only. 
If you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions: 
•  Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. 
• 
• 
Assemble everything you need. Find a clean area and lay out everything: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
one vial of Luveris, 
one ampoule of solvent, 
two alcohol swabs, 
one syringe, 
one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent, 
a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection, 
a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles. 
Open the ampoule of solvent: On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a small 
coloured dot. Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it  
easier to break. Gently flick the top section of the ampoule 
so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the 
bottom chamber. Now press the ampoule firmly over the 
neck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot. 
Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work-
surface. 
• 
Draw up the solvent: Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe, with the syringe in  
one hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and 
draw up all of the solvent. 
Carefully set the syringe down on the work-surface, taking 
care not to touch the needle. 
• 
• 
Prepare the injection solution: Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder vial, pick  
up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial 
of Luveris. Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do 
not shake. 
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting  
solution is clear and does not contain any particles. Turn 
the vial upside down and gently draw the solution back 
into the syringe. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately. 
After dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the 
container with the follitropin alfa powder. Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into 
the syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear. 
Up to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 mL of solvent. 
• 
Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles 
in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing 
upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air 
collects at the top. Gently push the plunger until the air 
bubbles are gone. 
• 
Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to 
inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Firmly pinch the 
skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 
90° angle using a dart-like motion. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into 
a vein. Inject the solution by pushing gently on the 
plunger. Take as much time as you need to inject 
all the solution. Immediately withdraw the needle 
and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a 
circular motion. 
Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and 
empty glass containers in the sharps container provided. Any unused solution must be discarded. 
If you use more Luveris than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome may occur (see section 4). However, this will only occur if hCG is 
administered (see section 2 under “Warnings and precautions”). 
If you forget to use Luveris 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor 
might ask you to stop using Luveris. 
Allergic reaction 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can 
sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the treatment and 
formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see section 2 under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). If this happens, your 
doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are 
found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
section 2 under “Blood clotting problems”). 
• 
Other common side effects 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Headache 
Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain 
Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts), breast pain and pelvic pain 
Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation 
Torsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, 
there have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), 
a urine-derived medication also containing LH. 
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a 
history of prior tubal disease.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the treatment and 
formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see section 2 under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). If this happens, your 
doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are 
found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
section 2 under “Blood clotting problems”).

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen-Cilag International N.V. 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 19 November 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to introduce an homologous booster dose 
(second dose) of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen based on interim efficacy, immunogenicity and safety 
results from different clinical studies including the two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 studies COV3001 and COV3009. In addition, an update to introduce an heterologous booster 
dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen following completion of a primary vaccination with an approved 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is introduced based on immunogenicity and safety interim results from the 
phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the efficacy data 
for the primary vaccination schedule based on final analysis from study COV3001. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
2.  Introduction 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (also refer hereafter as Ad26.COV2.S) is indicated for active immunisation 
to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approved 
posology is a single dose of 5x1010 vp in 0.5 mL, to be administered intramuscularly.  
In the current variation, the MAH is seeking a posology for homologous booster immunization at least 
2 months after primary vaccination in individuals ≥18 years of age and the use of Ad26.COV2.S for 
heterologous booster immunization following completion of primary vaccination with an approved 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  
This assessment report (AR) summarises the available data on immunogenicity, efficacy and safety for 
participants in different studies who received a booster dose (second dose) of COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen at different time interval (2, 3, or 6 months) between the first and the second dose. 
The durability of protection and of immunogenicity after a single dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is 
presented as data to support the need for a booster dose (second dose). Interim real-world-
effectiveness (RWE) data from study COV4002 and a summary of additional RWE studies are also 
presented by the MAH. 
The MAH also proposes the use of Ad26.COV2.S for heterologous booster immunization following 
completion of primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Selected data from the 
‘Mix and Match study’ (DMID 21-0012, published by Atmar et al.) are presented in support. 
The Product Information has been updated accordingly.

3.  Clinical Immunogenicity aspects 
Results from several clinical studies were included to support the proposed homologous booster 
variation: the First-in-human trial COV1001, Phase 1 and 2 studies COV1002 and COV2001 and the 
Phase 3 trial COV3009. Data from the ongoing dedicated booster study COV2008 are not yet available. 
Study results from the Phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012, were also included, to support the 
heterologous boost by COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen after a primary vaccination with an approved mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccine. 
This section presents a summary of immunogenicity results from studies conducted by the MAH, 
focusing on the durability of the immune response induced by primary vaccination with a 
single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp dose level and homologous boostability 2, 3 and 6 
months after first vaccination (at 5×1010 vp or 1.25 ×1010 vp dose levels).Most of the results described 
thereafter are for the original Victoria strain. Limited results are presented for the variants of concern 
(VOC). 
Immunogenicity analyses were performed on the Per-protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) set, unless 
specified otherwise. The PPI is defined as all randomized and vaccinated participants for whom 
immunogenicity data are available, excluding participants with major protocol deviations expected to 
impact the immunogenicity outcomes. In addition, samples obtained after missed vaccinations or 
participants with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring after screening (if applicable) are excluded 
from the analysis set, while samples obtained up to that point are included in the analysis. 
For study COV3009, it should be noted that results are based on partial data as not all samples for the 
different timepoints have been analysed.  
Due to a pause implemented across studies in the Ad26.COV2.S clinical development program in 
October 2020 upon a study pausing rule being met in study COV3001, blood draws for immunogenicity 
on the Day of second vaccination were delayed for the majority of COV1001 Cohort 3 participants from 
Day 57 onwards. For the majority of participants, the actual timing of Day 57 blood draws ranged from 
86 to 107 days post vaccination (median visit = Day 87). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis (ie, only 
including participants with samples collected out of per protocol visit window) was performed on the 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the Day 239 timepoint (8 months), which is discussed in this document, is 
referred to as Day 268 (9 months). 
The study pause delayed the second vaccination and blood draws for immunogenicity in COV1002 
Cohort 1. The actual timing of the Day 57 blood draw ranged from 73 to 88 days postvaccination 
(median = 78 days) in Cohort 1. Therefore, data presented for Cohort 1 are added based on the 
sensitivity analysis and Day 57 timepoint is referred to as ‘Day 78’. 
No formal statistical testing of the immunogenicity data has been conducted. Descriptive statistics 
were calculated for continuous immunologic parameters at all timepoints.  
Finally, data from the Phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012, an ongoing heterologous platform boost study 
conducted by NIH/NIAID in the US (also referred to as Mix and Match study, published in Atmar et al. 
2021) were also presented. This study is evaluating the immune responses in adult participants who 
received a homologous or heterologous booster vaccination at least 12 weeks after primary 
vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen (2 doses of Moderna-mRNA-1273 [100 
µg] or 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech-BNT162b2 [30 µg]) or Ad26.COV2.S [1 dose 5×1010 vp].

Pseudotyped Virus Neutralization Assay (psVNA) - JBDA 
A pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (psVNA) was performed by Janssen Bioassay Development 
and Automation (JBDA). Codon optimized, synthesized DNA encoding SARS
CoV
2 Spike protein (based 
on Wuhan
Hu

terminally truncated by 19 amino acids was 
‐
‐
cloned into a derivative of the pCDNA3.1 expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Substitutions 
‐
‐
‐
and deletions in the Spike protein gene open reading frame were introduced and confirmed using 
standard molecular biology techniques. HIV
based lentiviral pseudotyped particles harboring the SARS
CoV
2 Spike protein variants were produced using the ViraPower Lentiviral Expression system (Thermo

Fisher Scientific). As well as the original WA1/202 strain (with D614G mutation), pseudoviruses of the 
following variants were also generated: Beta (B.1.351 lineage), Gamma (P.1 lineage), Lambda (C.37 
lineage) and Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage). 
Serum standards, controls and serial diluted serum samples were incubated at room temperature with 
pseudovirus particles. After 1h incubation, the serum
particle mixture was inoculated onto 
Hek293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 target cells which stably express the human ACE2 and human TMPRSS2 
genes. Luciferase activity was measured 40h later, using NeoLite substrate (Perkin Elmer) and the 
‐
EnSight Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). SARS
CoV
2 neutralizing titers were calculated using a 
four
parameter curve fit as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction (IC50) of luciferase readout 
‐
‐
was observed compared to the Control.  
‐
The assay was developed in-house at JBDA and is not qualified or validated. 
Pseudotyped Virus Neutralization Assay (psVNA) - Monogram 
Principle 
A pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (psVNA) was partially validated and performed by Monogram. 
The measurement of neutralizing antibody activity was performed by generating HIV-1 pseudovirions 
that express the SARS CoV-2 spike protein from both the reference strain (with DG614G mutation) and 
the Beta variant (B.1.351 lineage). The pseudoviruses were prepared by co-transfecting HEK293 
producer cells with an HIV-1 genomic vector and a SARS-CoV-2 envelope expression vector. 
Neutralizing antibody activity was measured by assessing the inhibition of luciferase activity in HEK293 
target cells expressing the ACE2 receptor following pre-incubation of the pseudovirions with serially 
diluted serum samples. The expression of luciferase activity in target cells is inhibited by the presence 
of functional anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies with neutralizing activity. Data were displayed by plotting the 
percent inhibition of luciferase activity vs. log10 reciprocal of the serum/plasma dilution and antibody 
titers are reported as the reciprocal of the serum dilution conferring 50% inhibition (IC50) of 
pseudovirus infection. 
To ensure that the neutralizing activity measured was specific for SARS CoV-2, each test sample was 
also assessed using a non-specific pseudovirus (specificity control) that expresses a nonreactive 
envelope protein of one or more unrelated viruses (e.g. avian influenza virus). 
Assay development and Qualification/validation  
Assay Validation Reports were provided (Validation report for SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (D614G 
mutation): MG-SF-VALDVR1088.000, Validation report for SARS-CoV-2 Beta Variant: MG-SF-VALD-
VR1095.000). 
Repeatability testing was repeated based on six replicate determinations versus three replicate 
determinations as originally proposed. Assay repeatability was reassessed using alternative low titer 
samples to substitute for several initial low titer sample candidates that resulted titers below the assay 
MRD (<40). Assay linearity/dynamic range (LLOQ and ULOQ) was reassessed/extended by evaluating 
one or more additional high titer CoV-2 nAb sample candidates. The evaluation of assay repeatability 
based on ID80 titers was performed as amended for ID50 titers. Specific validation acceptance criteria 
were not applied to ID80 titer determinations. ID80 titers are considered validated if the evaluation of 
ID80 titers satisfies the established acceptance criteria for ID50 titers (CV≤45%). The results of the 
PhenoSense SARS CoV-2 nAb is routinely reported as an ID50 titer and/or ID80 titer (1/Dilution). 
Results can be reported qualitatively (positive, negative) based on a pre-defined dilution cutoff (e.g., 
>50% inhibition at 1:40 dilution). 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 7/151 
 
 
 
The PhenoSense SARS CoV-2 nAb Assay has been validated and qualified as an accurate method to 
quantitate anti-SARS CoV-2 nAb activity directed at the D614G Spike variant (Refer to the PhenoSense 
Anti-SARS CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Assay: D614G Variant Study (MG-SF-ST-ST0358)). Validation 
parameters and acceptance criteria were defined (p. 11 MG-SF-VALD-VR1088.000). 
Results summary 
Repeatability: Intra-assay variation of ID50 and ID80 titers is consistently <35% CV and averaged 
19.8% for ID50 values and 15.0% for ID80 values. 
Intermediate Precision: Total assay variation based on within-run and between-run components is 
<35% CV and averages ~20% for ID50 values and ~17% for ID80 values. 
Linearity: ID50 and ID80 titer determinations exhibit a high degree of linearity across 2.5 log10 and 
1.9 log10 ranges. 
Limits of Quantitation: ID50 LLOQ= 42 and ULOQ= 9484; ID80 LLOQ= 84 and ULOQ= 3496. Extension 
of the ULOQ will be further assessed upon the identification of an appropriate high titer sample with 
the requisite volume for testing. 
Report MG-SF-VALD-VR1095.000 describes a similar but partial validation of the assay for the beta 
variant (B.1.351), using n=6 unknown sera, n=12 B.1.351 sera, n=6 B.1.1.7 sera, n=6 P.1 sera, n=6 
B.1.427/429 sera, and n=6 B.1.526 sera. 
Partial validation and acceptance criteria were defined (p. 8 in MG-SF-VALD-VR1095.000). Within-run 
variation, assay repeatability, intermediate precision and linearity is acceptable. ID50 ULOQ= 25,529; 
LLOQ= 41. 
Result expression and definition 
Neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as IC50 units. 
A participant was defined as a responder if they were negative at baseline (<LLOQ) and positive 
(>LLOQ) post vaccination OR were positive at baseline (>LLOQ) and showed an increase in titer from 
baseline of ≥4-fold.

(RLUs).  
Titers are reported as log10 of EC50 (50% effective concentration), compared with a high titer serum 
sample used as an internal reference standard, with a lower limit of quantification at 1.218.  
The assay was developed in-house at Janssen Bioassay Development and Automation and is not 
qualified or validated. 
Neutralisation assay used in Heterologous booster study 
Assay 
The Duke NAb Laboratory for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccine Research and Development (Duke Nab Lab; 
PI: Dr. David Montefiori) assessed the magnitude, kinetics, duration, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody responses in the DMID Protocol #21-0012 by using a fully validated assay in an 
environment that operates in compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP). Assays were 
performed on all samples with Spike-pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 D614G. A subset of samples were 
assayed with Spike-pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 AY.3 (Delta lineage variant) and with 
Spike-pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta variant). These viruses were prepared by Dr. 
Montefiori’s laboratory using a lentivirus for pseudotyping and a luciferase reporter gene for 
quantitative measurements of virus neutralization. Results are reported as Inhibitory Dilution 50 
(ID50) and Inhibitory Dilution 80 (ID80) neutralization titers. These values represent the serum 
dilution that reduces relative luminescence units (RLU) by either 50% or 80% relative to the RLU in the 
virus control wells after subtraction of background RLU. This study was completed under the oversight 
of the Quality Assurance Unit for Duke Vaccine Immunogenicity Programs (QADVIP). 
Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped viruses was assessed in 293T/ACE2 cells as 
described in SOP “CFAR02-A0026 Measuring Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Using 
Pseudotyped Virus and 293T/ACE2 Cells.” This assay has been formally validated and is part of Drug 
Master File # 26862 with the Federal Drug Administration. Assay validation was performed with human 
serum samples and monoclonal antibodies using the D614G form of the Wuhan-1 Spike. This assay is 
in the process of being validated for B.1.351, but has not been validated using B.1.617.2. The assay is 
performed in 96-well flat-bottom clear standard non-coated or Poly-L-Lysine treated culture plates for 
high throughput capacity. Relative luminescence units are measured in 96-well flat bottom black/white 
plates for enhanced luminescence with minimal bleed-over. Use of a clonal cell line provided enhanced 
precision and uniformity. 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped viruses are prepared and titrated for infectivity by using mutated 
forms of an expression plasmid encoding codon-optimized full-length Spike of the Wuhan-1 strain 
(VRC7480) provided by Drs. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine Research Center, 
National Institutes of Health (USA). Mutations were introduced into VRC7480 by site-directed 
mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies. 
All mutations were confirmed by full-length Spike gene sequencing. The variants used are displayed in 
Table 3.

Pseudovirions are produced in HEK 293T/17 cells by transfection using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent 
and a combination of Spike plasmid, lentiviral backbone plasmid (pCMV ΔR8.2) and firefly Luc reporter 
gene plasmid (pHR' CMV Luc) in a 1:17:17 ratio in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Transfection mixtures 
are added to pre-seeded HEK 293T/17 cells in T-75/T-225 flasks containing growth medium and 
incubated for 16-20 hours at 37°C, followed by two additional days with fresh growth medium 
Pseudovirions are titrated for infectious dose (TCID50) by making serial 3-fold or 5-fold dilutions in 
quadruplicate for a total of 11 dilutions in 96-well flat-bottom clear standard non-coated or poly-L-
lysine-coated culture plates. An additional 4 wells serve as background controls; these wells received 
cells but no virus. Freshly suspended 293T/ACE2.MF cells are added (10,000 cells/well) and incubated 
for 66-72 hours. Medium is removed by gentle aspiration and 30 μl of Promega 1X lysis buffer added 
to all wells. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, 100-110 μl of Bright-Glo luciferase 
reagent is added to all wells, mixed, and 105 μl of the mixture added to a black/white plate (Perkin-
Elmer). Luminescence is measured using a GloMax Navigator luminometer (Promega). TCID50 is 
calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. 
Neutralization is measured by using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and 
containing a firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene for quantitative measurements of infection by relative 
luminescence units (RLU). Luminescence is measured using a GloMax Navigator luminometer 
(Promega). Neutralization titers are the serum dilution at which RLUs are reduced by either 50% 
(ID50) or 80% (ID80) compared to virus control wells after subtraction of background RLUs. Serum 
samples are heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C prior to assay. 
For assay internal quality controls (IQC), a qualified positive control is tested on each assay plate. The 
positive control used for assays with D614G is DH1043NHS, which consists of a potent RBD-specific 
neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), DH1043, diluted in heat inactivated normal human serum 
(NHS) at 40 μg/ml. The positive control used for assays with B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 is DH1047NHS, 
which consists of a potent RBD-specific neutralizing mAb, DH1047, diluted in heat inactivated NHS at 
100 μg/ml. Assay run controls consist of COVID-19 convalescent serum samples or SARSCoV-2 
vaccine recipients with high, medium and low ID50 and ID80 titers against the test virus, plus a 
normal human serum negative control. In addition, internal quality control samples (IQC-High, IQC-
Medium, and IQC-Low) from the IQC Program for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assay Monitoring (SAAM) 
program operated by the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) were 
included in each experiment.  
Reporting 
The assay’s lower limit of detection (LLOD) is 10. For descriptive analyses, values reported as below 
the LLOD are assigned a value of LLOD/2 = 5. Specific to Pseudovirus D614G, the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) are as follows: 
Levels that are reported as above the LLOD but below the Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) are 
kept as reported. Values that are greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) are when actual 
values are provided. If actual values above the ULOQ are not provided, observations are replaced with 
a value equivalent to the ULOQ. 
Selected summaries of neutralizing titers calibrated to the WHO standard International Units (IU50/mL 
and IU80/mL), are presented. Conversion was done using calibration factors specifically for the SARS-
CoV
 2 D614G Pseudovirus: a factor of 0.242 for ID50 and a factor of 1.502 for ID80.

Binding Antibody assays used in Heterologous booster study 
Binding Antibodies: 4-plex ECLIA V.2 
Testing was performed using the automated 4-plex MSD method as detailed in in VRC-VIP SOP 5525: 
Multiplex (4-Plex) Assay for the detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human 
sera. Quantification of IgG concentrations in serum/plasma were performed with a Beckman Biomek 
based automation platform. This variant 4-plex is in the final stages of validation of the S-2P-B.1.351 
antigen and confirmation of validation of the S-2P-WA-1 antigen, all performed in alignment with the 
previously validated SARS-CoV-2 3-plex as well as the FDA provided guidance on variant validation 
(DMF 023422). 
Briefly, MSD SECTOR® plates (384-well) are precoated by MSD with WA-1 SARS-CoV-2 spike (S- 2P), 
B.1.351 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein and B.1.351 spike protein in 
each well in a specific spot-designation for each antigen. The assay is to be performed with a Beckman 
Coulter Biomek based automation integration platform including the Biotek 405TS Plate Washer. 
Serum samples will be heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56oC prior to assay. Plates are blocked for 
60 minutes at room temperature (RT) with MSD blocker A solution without shaking. Plates are washed 
and MSD reference standard (calibrator), QC test sample (pool of COVID-19 convalescent sera) and 
human serum test samples are added to the precoated wells in duplicates in an 8-point dilution series. 
Reference standard is added in triplicates. MSD Control sera (low, medium and high) are added 
undiluted in triplicates as per validated assay format. Additional assay controls might be added in 
triplicates. Samples are incubated at RT for 4 hours with shaking on a Titramax Plate shaker 
(Heidolph) at 1500 rpm. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in the sera or controls bind to the 
coated antigens. Plates are washed to remove unbound antibodies. Antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-
2 viral proteins are detected using an MSD SULFOTAGTM anti-human IgG detection antibody incubated 
for 60 minutes at RT and with shaking. Plates are washed and a read solution (MSD GOLDTM read 
buffer) containing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) substrate is applied to the wells, and the plate is 
entered into the MSD MESO Sector S 600 detection system. An electric current is applied to the plates 
and areas of well surface which form antigen-anti human IgG antibody SULFO-TAGTM complex will 
emit light in the presence of the ECL substrate. 
The MSD MESO Sector S 600 detection system quantitates the amount of light emitted and reports the 
ECL unit response as a result for each test sample, control sample and reference standard of each 
plate. Analysis is performed with the MSD Discovery Workbench software, Version 4.0. Calculated 
ECLIA parameters to measure binding antibody activities will include interpolated concentrations or 
assigned arbitrary units (AU/mL) read from the standard curve. A 4-pl curve was used for the analysis. 
Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism Version 8.0. 
FFP 10-plex ECLIA 
A fit-for-purpose (FFP) 10-plex ECLIA assay was developed and used to further assess IgG binding 
responses to various SARS-COV-2 spike variants of interest (VOIs) and VOCs antigens. Multiplexed 
Plates (MSD SECTOR® 96-well) precoated with up to ten antigens per panel are supplied by the 
manufacturer. Prior to any sample evaluation or data release, each 10-plex panel is functionally 
characterized and evaluated at the VIP, in addition to any quality control testing conducted by the 
manufacturer. On the day of the assay, the plate is blocked for 60 minutes with MSD Blocker A (5% 
BSA). The blocking solution is washed off and test samples are applied to the wells at 4 dilution 
(1:100, 1:500, 1:2500 and 1:10,000) unless otherwise specified and allowed to incubate with shaking 
for two hours. Plates are washed and Sulfo-tag labeled anti IgG antibody is applied to the wells and 
allowed to associate with complexed coated antigen – sample antibody within the assay wells. Plates 
are washed to remove unbound detection antibody. A read solution containing ECL substrate is applied

to the wells, and the plate is entered into the MSD Sector instrument. A current is applied to the plate 
and areas of well surface where sample antibody has complexed with coated antigen and labeled 
reporter will emit light in the presence of the ECL substrate. The MSD Sector instrument quantitates 
the amount of light emitted and reports this ECL unit response as a result for each sample and 
standard of the plate. Magnitude of ECL response is directly proportional to the extent of binding 
antibody in the test article. All calculations are performed within Excel and the GraphPad Prism 
software, version 7.0. Readouts are provided as Area Under Curve (AUC). 
The method described has been previously published (A. Pegu et al.) , though the specific makeup of 
variant antigens included in 10-plex panels may vary. We note that only two of these VOC are reported 
here. 
Reporting 
For concentrations that are below the Lower Limit of Detection (LLOQ) numeric values equivalent to 
LLOQ/2 are assigned before and for all descriptive reporting. For concentrations greater than the upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ) values are kept and reported when actual values are provided. If actual 
values above the ULOQ are not provided, observations are replaced with a value equivalent to the 
ULOQ. Bridging to the WHO standard Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU/mL) was done using a 
conversion factor of 0.0090, specific to the IgG SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. 
3.2.  Participant information 
A summary of participant disposition, study completion/withdrawal information, and baseline and 
demographic characteristics for studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV3009 were provided.  
Participant information for the studies COV1001 (Cohort 1a and Cohort 3), COV1002 and COV2001 
were provided at initial conditional MA. For participant information for study COV3009, see efficacy 
section.  
3.3.  Results 
3.3.1.  Immunogenicity of Primary Single-dose Vaccination 
3.3.1.1.  Durability of the Single Dose Primary Vaccination Schedule - parental SARS-CoV-2 
strain 
The main data on the durability of neutralizing and binding antibody responses against the original 
SARS-CoV-2 strain up to at least 6 months after the 1-dose primary vaccination schedule with 
Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) are available from studies COV2001 (Group 5; up to 6 months [Day 169]) 
and COV1001 (Group 2 for both Cohort 1a and Cohort 3, up to 8-9 months [Day 239/Day 268]). 
Study COV2001 
In study COV2001, results for the nAb response (wtVNA) up to 6 months post-vaccination are available 
for 33 subjects, including 20 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 13 of ≥65 yoa. Binding Ab (S-ELISA, Nelexis) 
results are available for 73 subjects, including 44 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 29 of ≥65 yoa. 
Graphical representations of neutralizing and binding antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 over 
time (GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Descriptive statistics

Of note, as part the COV1001 study, 25 participants (18 to 55 years of age) at a single clinical site were 
enrolled  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine  in  depth  (COV1001  Cohort  1b). 
Overall,  COV1001  Cohort  1b  data  confirm  that  Ad26.COV2.S  elicited  durable  humoral  and  cellular 
immune responses for at least 8 months following vaccination in this age group. The observed humoral 
response was in line with the results of Cohort 1a. 
The durability of the cellular immune response was also assessed in this cohort. The subject that received 
1 single dose at the approved dose level are represented by the filled triangles (Figure 5).

Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination, Cohort 1b (VAC31518COV1001) 
3.3.1.2.  Immunogenicity of Primary Single-dose Vaccination against VOCs 
Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 VOC, ie, B.1.1.7 (VUI2020 12/01, Alpha, Kent), B.1.351 
(20H/501Y.V2, Beta, Republic of South Africa [RSA]), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) after 1 dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S at the of 5×1010 vp level, were measured in selected samples from COV1001 Cohort 1a. 
6 paired samples of vaccinees having received 1 single dose of the vaccine at the approved dose level 
were tested for the Alpha and Beta strains at Day 29 and Day 71 following vaccination. For the Delta 
variant, the 6 samples were also tested at Day 239 in addition to both earlier timepoints. 
Immunogenicity against VOCs (alpha, kappa, delta, gamma, epsilon, beta) was also assessed over 
time in subjects from Cohort 1b. Overall data indicate a higher immune response against the original 
strain, and lower immune responses against the Beta and Delta strains, with a trend to increase from 
Day 29 to Day 71. nAb against the Delta variant could still be detectable at Day 239 post-vaccination, 
but not in all samples.

3.3.2.  Immunogenicity after booster (second dose) vaccination 
3.3.2.1.  Homologous Booster Vaccination 2 to 3 Months After Dose 1 (5×1010 vp, 5×1010 vp 
Dose Level) - parental SARS-CoV-2 strain 
3.3.2.1.1.  Study COV3009 – Booster dose (second dose) at 2 Months 
In study COV3009, immunogenicity of a booster dose (second dose) administered 2 months after the 
first vaccination was evaluated in healthy adults aged ≥18 years of age, including older adults aged 
≥60 years of age. Participants received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp as the 
first dose and received Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp as the booster dose (second dose), 2 
months (Day 57) after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity data of study COV3009 are available for a 
limited number of subjects of the immunogenicity subset and only up to 14 days post-second vaccine 
dose (i.e. Day 71).  
Results are presented overall (total of 157 vaccinated subjects) and by subgroups (age, comorbidities). 
Baseline results are available for 37 and 36 vaccinated subjects of 18-59 yoa, without and with 
comorbidities respectively, and for 45 and 36 vaccinated subjects ≥60 yoa, without and with 
comorbidities respectively. The number of subjects included in the Day 71 analyses are even lower: 17 
and 15 vaccinated subjects of 18-59 yoa, without and with comorbidities respectively, and for 24 and 
22 vaccinated subjects ≥60 yoa, without and with comorbidities respectively. 
Ab GMT increases from baseline up to 2 months post-dose one (baseline GMT [95% CI]: < LLOQ [< 
LLOQ; < LLOQ]; Day 29 GMT [95% CI]: 367 [295; 456]; Day 57 GMT [95% CI]: 518 [422; 635]). 
These results are consistent with those observed for Group 5 of study COV2001 (both 18-55 yoa and 
≥65 yoa) and Group 2 of Cohort 1a of study COV1001 (18-55 yoa). The second vaccine dose increased 
the GMT up to 2220 (95% CI: 1794; 2748). The GMT (95% CI) fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 
month post-vaccination is thus 4.7 (3.8-5.7). 
Responder rates were high pre- (Day 57 % responders [95% CI]: 94.7 [89.4; 97.8]) and post- (Day 
71 % responders [95% CI]: 100.0% [94.7; 100.0]) booster dose (second dose). Both GMTs and 
responder rates were low in the placebo group at each timepoint. 
If the results are analyzed by age and the presence of comorbidities, some differences in vaccine 
responses are observed between subgroups.  
Older adult individuals (both without and with comorbidities) tend to have a lower level of Ab 1 month 
post-vaccination (Day 29-GMT [95% CI] of 318 [222; 455] and of 287 [169; 490] in older adults 
without and with comorbidities, respectively) when compared to the younger adults (Day 29-GMT 
[95% CI] of 493 [328; 742] and of 419 [252; 695] in younger adults without and with comorbidities, 
respectively). However, this difference is not observed anymore before the boost (Day 57) for both 
older adult subgroups (Day 57-GMT [95% CI] of 465 [342; 632] and of 423 [268; 667] in older adults 
without and with comorbidities, respectively) and young adult subjects with comorbidities (Day 57-
GMT [95% CI] of 479 [293; 784]). Young individuals without comorbidities tend to have a higher level 
of S-specific Ab Day 57 (GMT [95% CI] of 760 [491; 1178]). 
Young individuals without comorbidities also tend to have a higher level of S-specific Ab following the 
second vaccine dose (GMT [95% CI] of 3664 [2734; 4910]) when compared to the young adult 
subjects with comorbidities (GMT [95% CI] of 1804 [948; 3431]) and to both groups of older adult 
subjects (GMT [95% CI] of 2161 [1533; 3048] and of 1790 [1118; 2864] in older adults without and 
with comorbidities, respectively). A similar trend for lower Ab titer in the older adult subjects with and 
without comorbidities compared to both groups of younger adult subjects is observed post-boost.  
Consistent with the lower GMTs at 1 month post-dose 1 observed in the older adult subjects, 
responder rates were also lower when compared to the younger adult subjects at Day 29 (responder 
rate [95% CI] of 100.0% [87.2; 100.0] and of 93.3% [77.9; 99.2] in younger adults without and with

comorbidities, respectively, and of 89.2% [74.6; 97.0] and of 86.2% [68.3; 96.1] in older adults 
without and with comorbidities, respectively). Responder rates were high pre- and post-boost in all 4 
subgroups (at least 90% pre-boost and 100% post-boost). 
Spike-specific binding antibody concentrations and responder rates are provided below.

3.3.2.1.2.  Study COV2001 – Booster dose (second dose) at 2 or 3 months 
Participants >18 years of age received a booster dose (second dose) of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) 
either at Day 57 (2 months; Group 1) or at Day 85 (3 months; Group 9). Graphical representations of 
neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 over time (GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) 
are presented in Figure 9.  
Immunogenicity data following the administration of a booster dose (second dose) of the vaccine, at a 
dose level of 5×1010 vp, are available for 75 and 127 subjects of study COV2001 for nAb and binding 
Ab, respectively.  
•  Among the 75 participants for whom nAb data are available up to 1 month post-dose 2, 38 
received the second vaccine dose 56 days after the first one (group 1), and 37 received the 
booster dose (second dose) 84 days after the first dose (group 9). 
Among the subjects that received the 2 vaccine doses at 2 months interval (group 1), 23 were 
18-55 yoa and 15 were ≥65 yoa.  
Among the subjects that received the 2 vaccine doses at 3 months interval (group 9), 22 were 
18-55 yoa and 15 were ≥65 yoa. 
•  Among the 127 participants for whom binding Ab data are available up to 1 month post-dose 
2, 80 received the second vaccine dose 56 days after the first one (group 1), and 47 received 
it 84 days after the first dose (group 9).  
•  Among the 80 subjects that received the 2 vaccine doses at 2 months interval (group 1), 52 
were 18-55 yoa and 28 were ≥65 yoa. Binding Ab results at Day 169 post-dose 1 were also 
available for 50 and 27 younger adult and older adult subjects, respectively. 
•  Among the 47 subjects that received the 2 vaccine doses at 3 months interval (group 9), 27 
were 18-55 yoa and 20 were ≥65 yoa.  
The booster dose (second dose) given 2 months after the first dose administration (Day 57) 
induces an increase in nAb titer up to Day 71, followed by a slight decrease that can be observed at 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

Day 85 (1 month post-dose 2); GMT (95% CI) increased from 212 (142-314) at Day 57 to 518 (354-
758) at Day 71 and, then slightly decreased to 424 (301-597) at Day 85. The GMT (95% CI) fold-
increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination is thus 1.8 (1.4-2.4). 
The same pattern of responses is overall observed for the binding antibodies. GMT (95% CI) increased 
from 425 (334-541) at Day 57 to 1745 (1415-2151) at Day 71, and slightly decreased to 1655 (1335-
2052) at Day 85 when the second vaccine dose is administered 2 months after the first one. 
Similarly, the booster dose (second dose) given 3 months following the first dose 
administration (Day 85) induces an increase in nAb titer up to Day 99, followed by a slight decrease 
observed at Day 113 (1 month post-dose 2); GMT (95% CI) increased from 236 (169-328) at Day 85 
to 904 (691-1184) at Day 99 and, then slightly decreased to 694 (473-1018) at Day 113. The GMT 
(95% CI) fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination is thus 2.9 (2.0-4.3). 
When the  booster dose (second dose) is given 3 months after the first dose administration, GMT (95% 
CI) increased from 421 (310-571) at Day 85 to 2826 (2065-3870) at Day 99 and then decreased to 
reach 2466 (1876-3241) at Day 113. 
The differences in nAb and binding Ab levels observed between both groups is less marked at 1 month 
post-dose 2 than at 14 days post-dose 2. Whether a difference will still be observed at later timepoints 
post-dose 2 is currently not known. 
For group 1, who have an interval of 2 months between primary and booster vaccination, nAb titers 
are in line with the observations for binding Abs. GMT for the older adult participants tends to be lower 
than for the younger adult subjects pre-dose 2 (Day 57-GMTs [95% CI] of 169 [80; 357] and of 243 
[150; 394] for the older and younger adult subjects, respectively). At one month post-dose 2 (Day 
85), nAb GMTs (95% CI) increased to 346 (158; 756) and 477 (338; 674), in the older and younger 
adults, respectively. 
Also for group 9, who have an interval of 3 months between primary and booster vaccination, nAb 
titers are in line with the observations for binding Ab. Pre-dose 2 (Day 85) GMTs (95% CI) are similar 
between older and younger adults (215 [115; 401] and 250 [166;378], for older and younger adults, 
respectively). However, 1 month post-dose 2 (Day 113), nAb GMTs are higher for the older adults 
compared to the younger (875 [477;1606] and 593 [351; 1001], for older and younger adults, 
respectively. Of note, CIs were large.

3.3.2.1.3.  Study COV1001 –Booster dose (second dose)  at 2 or 3 months 
Cohort 1a (18 to 55 years of age) and Cohort 3 (≥65 years of age) Group 1 participants received a 
booster dose (second dose) of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) at Day 57 (2 months; Cohort 1a) or at Day 
87 (3 months; Cohort 3).  
Humoral responses following a second vaccine dose - Neutralizing and Binding Antibody Responses 
nAb results post-booster dose (second dose) for 24 participants of Cohort 1a and 21 participants of 
Cohort 3 are available. Binding Ab results post-booster dose (second dose) for 70 participants of 
Cohort 1a and 71 participants of Cohort 3 are available. 
Graphical representations of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 over time (GMTs 
with corresponding 95% CIs) are presented in the Figures below.  
Because of the different time interval between vaccine doses applied for the younger adult and the 
older adult participants, results cannot be compared between both cohorts. 
18-55 yoa adults (Cohort 1a) 
The booster dose (second dose) given at 2 months following the first dose administration (Day 57) 
induces an increase in nAb titer that is maintained up to Day 85 (1 month Post-dose 2). The GMT 
(95% CI) fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination is thus 2.9 (2.1-3.8). At Day 239, 
a decrease of nAb titer is observed. nAb GMTs (95% CI) decreased from 849 (664-1086) at Day 85 to 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

465 (348-620) at Day 239. Ab level were not measured between Day 85 and Day 239. It is thus not 
known when the decrease starts. Day 239-GMT is higher than the value observed at 1 month post-first 
dose (Day 29-GMT, 95% CI: 224, 168-298). Of note, the same pattern of response is observed for the 
higher dose level.  
Similarly than observed for nAb, the level of binding Ab was increased 14 days following the second 
vaccine dose and maintained up to Day 85 (1 month Post-dose 2) (Day 85-GMT, 95% CI: 1994, 1674-
2375; GMT, 95% CI fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination: 2.5, 2.1-3.1) before to 
decline to a GMT value of (95% CI) 933 (752-1159) at Day 239.

≥65 yoa adults (Cohort 3) 
The booster dose (second dose) was given 3 months following the first dose administration (because of 
study pause in study COV3001) and induced an increase in nAb titer that is maintained up to 1 month 
post-dose 2 (Day 29-GMT, 95% CI: 298, 200-444 versus Day 114-GMT, 95% CI: 1067, 630-1807). 
The GMT (95% CI) fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination is thus 4.3 (3.1-5.8). 
There are no longer term data.

Similarly than observed in the younger adults, the level of binding Ab was increased 14 days following 
the booster dose (second dose) and maintained up to Day 114 (1 month Post-dose 2) (Day 114-GMT, 
95% CI: 2040, 1603-2595; GMT, 95% CI fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination: 
4.5, 3.6-5.7) before to decline to a GMT value of (95% CI) 1099 (765-1581) at Day 268. The Ab level 
is higher than 1 month post-dose 1, i.e. GMT (95% CI) of 317 (250-403).

Humoral responses - Functional Antibody Characterization 
In study COV1001 (Cohorts 1a, 1b, and 3), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 
trimeric Spike antigen was measured by an ADCP assay.  
Results post-booster dose (second dose) were obtained for 72 and 73 participants of Cohorts 1a and 3, 
respectively, that were vaccinated with 2 vaccine doses, at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, given at 2 (Cohort 
1a) of 3 (Cohort 3) months interval.

The proportion of positive samples post-dose 2 tend to increase from pre- to post-dose 2 in both cohorts. 
The same trend was observed for the Phagocytic score GMs. In the younger adult subjects (Cohort 1a), 
the Phagocytic score GMs (95% CI) increased from 29 (23-36) at Day 57 to 71 (60-83) at Day 71 and 
87 (75-100) at Day 85. In the older adult subjects (Cohort 3), the GMs (95% CI) increased from 26 (21-
33) at Day 87 to 77 (63-94) at Day 100 and 89 (73-108) at Day 114. 
Data  from  Cohort  1b  are  too  limited  (and  mixed  with  the  other  regimen  tested  in  the  study)  to  be 
interpreted. 
Cellular immunity 
PBMCs  were  collected  from  39  participants  of  group  2  of  Cohort  1a  (18-55  yoa  adults,)  and  of  40 
participants of group 1 of Cohort 3 (≥65 yoa adults).  
CD4 Th1 cells were defined as CD4+ T cells expressing IFNγ and/or IL-2 (Th1), but not Th2 cytokines, 
and CD8 Th1 cells were defined as CD8+ T cells expressing IFNγ and/or IL-2.  
Following the second vaccine dose in younger adults, the proportion of subjects with S-specific CD4+ 
Th1 response were not increased. In addition, no increase in median response of the positive samples 
was observed. Similar observations were made for the CD8 T cell response. 
A  slight increase  of  the  proportion  of  positive  subjects  with  detectable  S-specific  CD4+  Th1  response 
was observed after the booster dose (second dose) in the older adult group (% positive sample [95% 
CI] of 47% [30%-65%] at Day 57 versus 66% [49%-80%] at Day 71), but with 95% CIs overlapping. 
No increase in the median response of the positive samples was observed following the second vaccine 
dose for this group. 
Similarly, a slight increase in the proportion of positive subjects with detectable S-specific CD8+ T cells 
was  observed  following  the  booster  dose  (second  dose)  in  the  older  adult  group  (%  positive  sample 
[95%  CI]  of  56%  [38%-73%)  at  Day  57  versus  64%  [46%-79%]  at  Day  71),  but  with  95%  CIs 
overlapping. However, no trend for an increase of the median response of S-specific CD8+ T cells was 
observed in the positive samples for this group.

3.3.2.1.4.  Study COV1002 – Booster dose (second dose) at 2 or 3 Months 
nAb and binding Ab results for 43 participants of Cohort 1 (≥20 to ≤55 years of age) and 48 participants 
of Cohort 2 (≥65 years of age) are available. 
Graphical representations of neutralizing and binding antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 over time 
(GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) are presented in the Figure 13 and Figure 14. 
Because of the study pause, the second vaccine dose was administered 3 months after the first dose in 
the young adults (≥20 to ≤55 Years, Cohort 1) instead of 2 months post-dose 1. The second vaccine dose 
was administered according to the protocol, i.e. 2 months after the first dose, in the older adults (≥65 
Years, Cohort 2) included in the study. Results can thus not be compared between both cohorts. 
Results follow the same pattern than results observed in study COV1001. Neutralizing and binding Ab 
are increased post-dose 2 when compared to 1 month post-dose 1 and pre-booster dose (second dose). 
In the younger adult cohort, pre-booster dose (second dose) (Day 78)-GMT (95% CI) increases from 
469 (382-576) to 1088 (817-1449) post-booster dose (second dose) (Day 106), resulting in a GMT (95% 
CI) fold-increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination of 2.3 (1.8-3.0). 
In the older adult cohort, pre-booster dose (second dose) (Day 57)-GMT (95% CI) increases from 281 
(204-386) to 429 (335-550) post-booster (second dose) (Day 85), resulting in a GMT (95% CI) fold-
increase from pre-dose 2 to 1 month post-vaccination of 1.5 (1.1-2.0). 
Since the GMT values pre-boost are different between cohorts, the magnitude of the response cannot be 
compared. It is not known if the Ab levels reached 1 month post-dose 2 will be sustained and for how 
long.

3.3.2.2.  Homologous Booster Vaccination 2 Months After Dose 1 (5×1010 vp, 5×1010 vp Dose 
Level) - VOCs  
Neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha and Beta SARS-CoV-2 VOC after 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S at 
the of 5×1010 vp level (56-day interval) were measured in a subset (n=6) of Day 71 (ie 14 days post-
dose 2) samples from COV1001 Cohort 1a and compared to the values with the reference strain.  
Ab titers are increased following the second vaccine dose. nAb titers against the Alpha variant following 
the second vaccine dose reached a comparable level than observed for the Victoria strain following the 
first vaccine dose. nAb titers post-dose 2 against the Beta variant remained low. 
Data observed 6 months post-boost also indicate that nAb titers against different variants increased but 
remained at a level inferior to the one obtained with the prototype. 
3.3.2.3.  Homologous Booster Vaccination 6 Months After Dose 1 (5×1010 vp, 5×1010 vp Dose 
Level) - parental SARS-CoV-2 strain 
In  Cohort  2a  (Group  2)  of  study  COV1001,  immunogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  after  the  primary 
vaccination  regimen  was  evaluated  in  healthy  adults  aged  ≥18  to  ≤55  years.  Participants  received 
Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp as the first dose and received Ad26.COV2.S at a 
dose  level  of  5×1010  vp  as  the  booster,  6  months  (Day  183)  after  primary  vaccination.  Results  are 
available for 17 participants. 
nAb  results  were  obtained  by  using two  different  psVNA  (JBDA  and  Monogram).  Results  were  further 
presented by using the wtVNA as these are considered the most relevant ones (Figure 15). Results were 
presented for the reference strain, but no data at Day 29 post-primary vaccination were provided. It is 
thus not know if the kinetic of the humoral response is similar to comparable groups of other studies. 
Type II variation assessment report

Data  show  an  increase  in  nAb  post-boost,  up  to  Day  211  (14  days  after  the  boost).  GMT  (95%  CI) 
increased from 436 (235-807) pre-boost to 2224 (1319-3750) at Day 211, resulting in a fold increase 
of 4.4 (2.7-7.1). 
Figure 15. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization wild type VNA – VICTORIA/1/2020 (IC50): Plot of the Actual Values 
Over Time; Cohort 2a; Per Protocol Immunogenicity Set (VAC31518COV1001) 
Binding Ab results are available by using the S-ELISA from Nelexis and JBDA. Binding Ab GMT (95% CI) 
increases from 798 (441-1443) pre-boost to 3779 (2583-5529) and 5108 (3402-7669) 7 and 14 days 
post-boost, respectively. 95% CIs post-boost are wide.  
It is also important to note that, before the boost, at Day 183, Ab titers are not comparable between the 
group  of  subjects  having  received  the  boost  (5x1010  vp,  5x1010  vp)  and  the  group  of  subject  having 
received the placebo as second dose (5x1010 vp, placebo). GMTs (95% CI) are respectively 798 (441-
1443) and 490 (349-689). So, even if a booster effect is observed post-injection of the Janssen COVID-
19 vaccine, it is considered that the magnitude of the response could not be representative. 
A Non-inferiority post-hoc analysis of both the nAb and binding Ab responses was performed on the 17 
subjects. Since there was no decrease pre-boost when compared to 1 month post-dose 1, the results 
are not considered relevant, even if NI was formally demonstrated. Results are thus not presented. 
3.3.2.4.  Homologous Booster Vaccination 6 Months After Dose 1 (5×1010 vp, 5×1010 vp Dose 
Level) - VOCs  
Samples  from  a  subset  of  Cohort  2a  participants  from  study  COV1001,  who  had  received  a  6  month 
booster vaccination (n=17), were measured for neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta,

Gamma (P.1 lineage), Delta, and Lambda (C.37 lineage) variants by a psVNA (assay status: developed) 
conducted  by  Janssen  Bioassay  Development  and  Automation  (JBDA),  prior  to  booster  (Day  183),  as 
well as 7 days (Day 190) and 28 days (Day 211) after booster. Further results were presented for the 
Beta strain with the partial validated psVNA of Monogram. 
Overall, for all the VOCs, and increase of Ab titers is observed post-boost, as early as 7 days after the 
boost. Slight increases are observed from 7 days to 14 days post-boost. nAb levels at Day 211 were 
higher for the Delta and Lambda strains, and lower for the Gamma and Beta strains. nAb levels observed 
at Day 211 for the variants are lower than the one observed for the parental strain. Post-boost levels for 
the variants appears to be similar or higher than the pre-boost Ab level for the parental strain. However 
the Ab level pre-boost for the parental strain was low (GMT and [95% CI] of 32 [<LOD-67]). The Ab 
level 1 month post-dose 1 would have been more informative, but results are not available. In addition, 
as it is likely that the psVNA lacks of sensitivity, measurement with a test with adequate performance 
would have been preferred.  
Binding Ab (JBDA ELISA) were also measured against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Delta variants in the 
samples of the 17 subjects. Results from Baseline, Day 29, Day 183, Day 190 and Day 211 samples are 
available. Similarly than for the nAb, binding Ab were increase post-boost.  
Overall, whether these (low) Ab levels reached post-boost would translate in clinical protection is not 
known. It is not known either if these Ab levels will be maintained over time, and for how long. 
3.3.2.5.  Homologous  Booster  Vaccination  6  Months  After  Dose  1  (5×1010  vp,  1.25×1010  vp 
Dose Level) - parental SARS-CoV-2 strain 
Anamnestic responses after antigen presentation at a dose level of 1.25×1010 vp were evaluated in the 
participants of group 5 of study COV2001. The booster dose was given 6 months post-vaccination (1 
single dose, 5×1010 vp). Binding Ab (S-ELISA) responses post-vaccination are available for 71 subjects, 
including 43 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 28 of ≥65 yoa (n at 7 days post-boost). Neutralizing Ab were 
not measured. 
The low dose exposure allows evaluation of the memory response to the S protein. It can also act as a 
booster dose.  
Overall, an anamnestic response is observed, as fast as 7 days post-exposure.  
In the younger adult group, GMT (95% CI) increased from 416 (294-588) at Day 169 to 1719 (1321-
2236) at Day 176 and to 2444 (1855-3219) at Day 197.  
Seven days after the boost, GMTs were lower in the older adult group, but tend to be similar at 28 days 
post-boost. Day 169-GMT (95% CI) was 234 (136-403), Day 176-GMT (95% CI) was 687 (404-1168), 
and Day 197-GMT (95% CI) was 2048 (1290-3253). 95% CIs are wide, reflecting the small number of 
samples included in the analysis (n=28). 
Proportions of responders were high and similar pre-and post-boost in both age groups. 
3.3.3.  Impact of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Ad26 Vector  
Theoretically, nAb to the Ad26 vector generated post-dose 1 may have the potential to negatively impact 
responses  to  Ad26.COV2.S  post-dose  2.  Therefore,  nAb  to  the  Ad26  vector  were  measured  in  study 
COV1001  (Cohort  1a;  Group  1  and  Group  3;  i.e.,  2  doses  of  Ad26.COV2.S  at  the  5×1010 vp  and 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

1×1011 vp dose levels, respectively, with a 56-day interval), by the Ad26 VNA at baseline and prior to 
second vaccination on Day 57.  
Results  of  24  and  23  18-55  yoa  participants  that  received  the  lower  (5×1010 vp) or  the  higher 
(1×1011 vp) dose levels, respectively, were included in the analysis. Only 1 sample was positive for Ad26 
nAb at baseline whereas 100% of the samples were positive for Ad26 nAb pre-dose 2. 
Correlation analysis of Ad26 neutralizing antibodies pre-dose 2 compared to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
antibodies post-dose 2 were calculated. Spearman r was -0.3178 and -0.2112 at Day 85 and Day 239 
post-primary vaccination, respectively. 
Since none of the samples were negative, the magnitude of the insert specific vaccine-elicited humoral 
immune responses post-dose 2 cannot be compared between Ad26 nAb positive and negative samples. 
The booster dose (second dose) of the vaccine is able to induce and increase in Ab titers, but it is not 
known if the magnitude of the responses is impacted by the Ad26 nAb-induced by the first vaccine dose. 
The impact on binding Ab and T cell responses was not presented.  
The MAH referred to further supporting data from the COV1002 study. Ad26 nAb results of 51 and 50 
participants of, respectively, cohorts 1 and 2, vaccinated with the dose level of 5×1010 vp, are available 
as well as results of 50 and 49 participants of, respectively, cohorts 1 and 2, vaccinated with the dose 
level of 1×1011 vp. However Ad26 nAb were only measured at baseline and not post-dose 1. Only four 
samples of cohort 1 were positive at baseline for natural Ad26 nAb. Twenty-six samples from cohort 2 
were positive at baseline for natural Ad26 nAb. The correlation between Ad26 nAb at baseline and SARS-
CoV-2 nAb post-dose 1 was poor. The correlation analysis of Ad26 nAb at baseline compared to SARS-
CoV-2  nAb  post-dose  2  are  not  considered  fully  relevant.  The  performed  analyses  do  no  assess  the 
impact of the Ad26 nAb-induced by the vaccine, but rather by the natural infection, on the SARS-CoV-2 
nAb-induced by the vaccine. 
Overall, the conclusion raised at conditional MA remained unchanged. The potential impact of natural or 
vaccine  induced  pre-existing  anti-Ad26  immunity  on  immunogenicity  and  vaccine  efficacy  remains 
unclear and should be further documented. This is even more important if regular boosters are needed. 
Integrated  results  of  the  different  trials  included  in  the  COVID-19  CDP,  and  overall  for  Ad26-based 
vaccination, if possible, are further expected.  
3.3.4.  Correlation Between Neutralizing and Binding Antibody Responses 
Correlation Between Neutralizing Antibodies and Binding Antibodies 
Correlation between nAb titers (IC50), measured by the wtVNA, and binding Ab concentrations (EU/mL), 
measured by S-ELISA for the reference strain, were calculated in samples from study COV1001 (Cohorts 
1a and 3), all dose levels and regimens:  
• 
• 
The Spearman correlations for Cohort 1a are: Day 29: 0.84; Day 71: 0.92; Day 85: 0.88; and 
Day 239: 0.84 
The Spearman correlations for Cohort 3 are: Day 29: 0.71; Day 71: 0.87; Day 85: 0.92; and 
Day 239: 0.84.  
There is a good correlation between both assays with a Spearman correlation ≥0.70, independent of the 
timepoint.  
Several samples in Cohort 3 have a value below the LLOQ for the wtVNA assay, while the value is >LLOQ 
for the ELISA on Day 239.  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 32/151 
 
 
 
The MAH also refer to the correlation results of study COV1002. The Spearman correlation for Cohort 1, 
from Day 15 to Day 85, was >0.65. For Cohort 2, the Spearman correlation was >0.70. 
As  a  consequence,  the  conclusion  reached  at  initial  conditional  MA  remained,  i.e.  results  should  be 
confirmed  on  samples  from  the  Phase  3  trial,  including  participants  of  various  countries  and  with 
comorbidities. Pooled analyses might be of added value. Meanwhile, both wtVNA and binding Ab results 
are needed to characterize the vaccine-induced immune responses.  
3.3.5.  Heterologous  Booster  Vaccination  With  Ad26.COV2.S  (5×1010  vp)  - 
parental SARS-CoV-2 strain 
3.3.5.1.  Introduction 
Phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012, an ongoing heterologous platform boost study conducted by NIH/NIAID 
in  the  US  (also  referred  to  as  Mix  and  Match  study),  is  evaluating  the  immune  responses  in  adult 
participants  who  received  a  homologous  or  heterologous  booster  vaccination  at  least  12  weeks  after 
primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen (2 doses of Moderna-mRNA-
1273 [100 µg] or 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech-BNT162b2 [30 µg]) or Ad26.COV2.S [1 dose 5×1010 vp]. 
Interim results are published in Atmar and Lyke 2021. The MAH presented data from the groups who 
received  one  dose  of  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  as  booster  vaccination.  Additional  data  considered 
relevant by the Rapporteur for this application will also be discussed hereafter.  
3.3.5.2.  Methods 
3.3.5.2.1.  Study design 
This is a phase 1/2, open-label clinical trial in individuals, 18 years of age and older, who are in good 
health,  have  no  known  history  of  COVID-19  or  SARS-CoV-2  infection,  and  meet  all  other  eligibility 
criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a delayed 
(>12  weeks)  vaccine  boost  on  a  range  of  EUA-dosed  COVID-19  vaccines  (mRNA-1273;  mRNA-
BNT162b2; or Ad26.COV2.S). This is an adaptive design and may add arms (and increase sample size) 
as  vaccines  are  awarded  EUA  and/or  variant  lineage  spike  vaccines  are  manufactured  or  become 
available. Enrollment is occurring at approximately twelve domestic clinical research sites. 
This study includes two cohorts. This report includes data of Cohort 1, which is designed to provide rapid 
information about the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of delayed boost. The report presented 
by the MAH focusses only on the groups who received one dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen as booster 
vaccination (group 4E, 5E, 6E who received as primary vaccination COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, Spikevax 
and Comirnaty, respectively). Cohort 2 is an adaptive cohort that is evaluating, in a prospective fashion, 
the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of EUA-dosed vaccine followed by delayed boost. Pools of 
subjects will be recruited to receive EUA-dosed vaccine and will be assigned, at a later date, to a delayed 
booster  vaccine  based  on  availability  of  vaccine  product,  to  enable  rapid  implementation  based  on 
situational assessment of need. Data of Cohort 2 are not available. 
1. Previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Janssen – Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 vp followed by: 
•  Group 1E – A 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
•  Group 4E – A 5x1010 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
•  Group 7E – A 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2

•  Group 10E – A 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273.211 
•  Group 12E – A 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
2. Previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Moderna – mRNA-1273 at 100 mcg for two doses followed by: 
•  Group 2E – A 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
•  Group 5E – A 5x1010 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
•  Group 8E – A 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2 
•  Group 13E – A 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
3. Previously EUA-dosed vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech - mRNA-BNT162b2 at 30 mcg for two doses 
followed by: 
•  Group 3E – A 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
•  Group 6E – A 5x1010 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
•  Group 9E – A 30-mcg dose of BNT162b2 
•  Group 11E – A 100-mcg dose of mRNA-1273.211 
•  Group 14E – A 50-mcg dose of mRNA-1273 
The anticipated sample size of each group is approximately 25 subjects 18 through 55 years of age and 
approximately 25 subjects 56 years of age and older for a total of 50 subjects per group. Because of this 
relatively limited sample size, analyses are descriptive and data should be interpreted with caution. 
Subjects in Cohort 1 did receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the designated delayed booster 
vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination. A telephone visit will occur at Day 8 
and in-person follow-up visits will occur on Days 15 and 29, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the 
vaccination. Reactogenicity will be assessed at the above-mentioned visits and blood will be drawn for 
immunogenicity assays. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria have not been presented by the MAH. All participants are individuals 18 
years of age and older, who are in good health, have no reported history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 
infection or monoclonal antibody infusion. As described in the publication of Atmar et al., no screening 
was  done  for  past  or  current  evidence  of  SARS
CoV
2  infection,  which  implies  that  participants  with 
(history of) an asymptomatic infection could have been enrolled in the study.

Statistical methods have not been presented by the MAH. The publication Atmar et al. described that no 
statistical comparisons between groups were planned and the analyses of safety and immunogenicity 
endpoints are only descriptive. The selected sample sizes of 50 per group and 25 per age stratum, allow 
for  99.5%  and  92.8%  probability  of  observing  at  least  one  an  AE  with  a  true  event  rate  of  10%, 
respectively. Confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity.  
3.3.5.2.2.  Endpoints 
The primary endpoints of the study are IgG serum binding antibody responses to the S-2P-WA-1 (wild 
type)  and  beta  variant  (  S-2P-B.1.351)  antigens,  as  obtained  from  the  4-plex  ECLIA  V.2  assay. 
Exploratory Endpoints include IgG serum binding antibody levels for two VOC: delta (S-2P-B.1.617.2) 
and alpha (S-2P-B.1.1.7), with S-2P-WA-1 as control.  
Endpoints  related  to  neutralization  are  ID50  and  ID80  neutralization  titers  assessed  with  Spike-
pseudotyped  viruses.  This  report  provides  only  data  on  neutralization  titers  specific  to  the  Spike-

pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 D614G. Neutralization titers specific to the Delta and Beta variant will 
be assessed, but are currently not yet provided. These data should be provided when available (refer to 
annex: new recommendations introduced in this procedure).  
This  report  only  includes  data  of  Day  1  (pre-boost)  and  Day  15  (14  days  post-boost).  During  this 
procedure, the MAH shared unpublished data of Day 29 nAb titers of the NIH study. 
3.3.5.3.  Results 
3.3.5.3.1.  Study participants 
The  data  discussed  in  the  report  provided  by  the  MAH  focusses  only  on  the  cohorts  who  received  a 
booster  vaccination  with  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen after  primary  vaccination  with  the  same  vaccine, 
Spikevax  (Moderna)  or  Comirnaty  (Pfizer/BioNTech)  (Groups  4E,  5E  and  6E,  respectively).  In  these 
groups, 50, 49 and 51 participants are enrolled, respectively.  
Binding and neutralizing antibody data is available of all participants on Day 1 and of all except one in 
group 6E (prime vaccination with Comirnaty) on Day 15.  
More detailed characteristic of participants enrolled in the study have been described in the publication 
by Atmar et al. Baseline characteristic of participants in the 3 concerned groups were similar: median 
age of approximately 50 years; at least 30% of each gender; and majority are white. 
The  mean  interval  between  primary  and  booster  vaccination  was  17.7  weeks,  19.3  weeks  and  20.6 
weeks  in  the  groups  who  were  primary  vaccinated  with  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen,  Spikevax  and 
Comirnaty, respectively. 
It  is  stated  in  the  publication  that  two  participants  (one  each  in  the  group  primary  vaccinated  with 
COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  and  with  Comirnaty)  who  had  serologic  evidence  of  prior  SARS  CoV
  2 
infection  and  one  participant  (primary  vaccinated  with  Spikevax)  who  developed  COVID
19  two  days 
prior to Study Day 29 were included in the analyses. As this is only one participant in each group, the 
‐
‐
impact on the results is considered negligible. 
3.3.5.3.2.  Immunogenicity results 
Neutralizing Antibodies 
Prior to booster administration on Day 1, nAb to the D614G strain could be measured in all participants 
who were primary vaccinated with Spikevax; 39 out of 50 subjects vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen  and  49  out  of  51  subjects  vaccinated  with  Comirnaty.  Serum  neutralization  antibody  titers 
(ID50) against Pseudovirus D614G prior to booster vaccination were highest in the Spikevax group (5E: 
GMT  [95%  CI]:  254.91  [185.86-349.62]),  followed  by  Comirnaty  (6E:  76.63  [55.25-106.28])  and 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (4E: 31.27 [20.13-48.57]).  
On Day 15 after a booster with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, nAb were increased in all groups compared 
to baseline. All, except one participant in the homologous boost group, had detectable nAb levels. Similar 
as for baseline nAb titers, after the booster vaccination, highest titers (ID50) are observed in the groups 
primary vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Spikevax: 1578.80 [1200.37-2076.54]; Comirnaty: 894.14 
[652.14-1225.94]).  Homologous  boosting  with  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  resulted  in  lower  titers 
(129.85 [92.05-183.17]). In addition, also the fold increase in nAb titers after the boost were highest in 
the group who received an mRNA vaccine as primary vaccination (Spikevax: 6.19 [95% CI: 4.49-8.54]; 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 35/151 
 
 
 
Comirnaty:  12.50  fold  [95%  CI:  8.74-17.87])  compared  to  the  group  primed with  COVID-19  vaccine 
Janssen (4.15 [2.97-5.80]). 
No meaningful differences are observed between the two age groups (18–55 yoa and ≥56 yoa) in pre- 
and post-boost nAb GMTs, with 95% CIs always largely overlapping. 
The same trend is observed for the ID80 nAb titer evaluation. 
Data on neutralizing capacity of the Delta and Beta variant is currently not yet available.

Timepoint - Groups 4E - 6E 
Additional data of the same study have been published by Atmar et al. including data of groups who 
were boosted with an mRNA vaccine, 3 months after primary vaccination with either COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen, Spikevax or Comirnaty. In this publication, nAb titers are presented in International Units ID50 
(IU50/mL) by using a conversion factor of 0.242. The data show that, in participants primary vaccinated 
with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, nAb GMTs (95% CI) on Day 15 are much higher after a heterologous 
boost  with  an  mRNA  vaccine  (Spikevax:  676.1  [517.5  –  883.3];  Comirnaty:  341.3  [239.6  –  486.3]) 
compared to a homologous boost (31.42 [22.3 - 44.3]). The fold increase in nAb titers in participants 
vaccinated  with  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  as  primary  vaccination  is  much  higher  after  heterologous 
boost with an mRNA vaccine compared to a homologous boost (36
 and 76
fold increase after boosting 
with  Comirnaty  and  Spikevax,  respectively).  Similarly,  also  for  participants  who  received  an  mRNA 
‐
‐
vaccine as primary vaccination, boosting with an mRNA vaccine resulted in higher nAb levels compared 
to boosting with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. 
During the assessment of this procedure, the MAH shared unpublished data of Day 29 nAb titers of the 
NIH study (Table 8). Similar as on Day 15, Day 29 data show that in participants primary vaccinated 
with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, nAb GMTs (IU50/mL; 95% CI) are much higher after a heterologous 
boost  with  an  mRNA  vaccine  ((Spikevax:  431.7  [322.6-577.6];  Comirnaty:  242.4  [189.9-309.4]) 
compared to a homologous boost (29.7 [22.3-39.6]). Of note, compared to Day 15, Day 29 nAb GMTs 
remained stable in the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen homologous boost group, while after a heterologous 
boost with an mRNA vaccine, nAb titers decreased. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 36/151 
 
 
 
 
When heterologous boosting with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in participants primary vaccinated with an 
mRNA vaccine, there is a trend for further increase in nAb by Day 29 compared to Day 15 (Spikevax: 
528.4 [3831-728.9]; Comirnaty: 266.8 [196.5-362.3]). However, boosting with an mRNA vaccine results 
in a decrease in nAb titers by Day 29 compared to Day 15, irrespective of the vaccine used for primary 
vaccination. While there was a clear difference in nAb titers on Day 15, on Day 29, nAb GTMs are roughly 
similar (with overlapping 95% CI) after a homologous boost with an mRNA vaccine (Spikevax: 700.0 
[568.6-861.8];  Comirnaty:  306.1  [244.2-383.6])  compared  to  a  heterologous  boost  with  COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen after primary mRNA vaccination (Spikevax: 528.4 [383.1 – 728.9]; Comirnaty: 266.8 
[196.5-362.3]). Of note, the booster dose used for Spikevax was the double of the authorized dose in 
EU. It could be that this influenced the results and that the response to a 100 µg booster is higher than 
the response to a 50 µg booster. 
Table 8 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) MixNMatch Phase 1/2 Study - 
Pseudovirus Antibody Titers Including Day 29 (Unpublished Data shared by the MAH) 
Binding Antibodies 
Binding Antibodies are evaluated on Day 15 after boosting with Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) and 
compared to Day 1 (pre-boost). Antibody responses are assessed against WA-1 antigen,  B.1.351 
Antigen (Beta variant), B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 (Delta Variant) (Table 9).  
All participants had detectable binding Ab to the WA
1 strain prior to booster administration on Day 1, 
approximately 18 to 21 weeks after primary vaccination, analyzed with the 4
plex ECLIA. Participants 
who received COVID-19 vaccine Janssen as primary vaccination had the lowest baseline binding Ab 
GMTs (7919.93 AU/mL) compared to participants who had an mRNA vaccine as primary vaccination. 
‐
‐
Baseline binding Ab titers were higher in participants vaccinated with Spikevax (70971.97 AU/mL) 
compared to Comirnaty (35625.45 AU/mL). No significant differences in baseline binding Ab titers are 
observed between the two age groups (18 – 55 yoa and ≥56 yoa).  
An increase in binding Ab levels following a boost with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen was observed in all 
groups by Day 15. Similar as for baseline binding Ab titers, after the booster vaccination, highest titers 
(95% CI) are observed in the groups primary vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Spikevax: 336599.73 
AU/mL [270353.77-419078.23]; Comirnaty: 211637.19 AU/mL [166422.09-269136.75]). Homologous 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 37/151 
 
 
 
 
boosting with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen resulted in lower binding Ab levels (36219.34 AU/mL 
[26195.90-50078.09]. In terms of fold increase in binding Ab titers post-boost vs. pre-boost, no 
meaningful differences are observed between groups (all 95% CIs are overlapping).  
It was mentioned in the Immunogenicity Summary report that binding Ab responses further increased 
by Day 29, reaching a 5.3 fold, 7.0 fold and 7.9 fold increase versus baseline in participants who had 
primary vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, Spikevax or Comirnaty, respectively. However, 
the data were not provided. 
Baseline binding Ab titers against the B.1.351 Antigen (Beta-variant) are lower compared to the 
WA-1 antigen, but relative differences between the type of vaccine used as primary vaccination is 
similar. Participants who received COVID-19 vaccine Janssen as primary vaccination had the lowest 
baseline binding Ab GMTs (2924.81 AU/mL) compared to participants who had an mRNA vaccine as 
primary vaccination. Baseline binding Ab titers were higher in participants vaccinated with Spikevax 
(28906.08 AU/mL) compared to Comirnaty (17257.52 AU/mL). After the booster vaccination, GMTs 
increased to 15031.97 AU/mL (10075.70-22426.24); 138257.72 AU/mL (110105.02-173608.78); and 
99536.65 AU/mL (77764.17-127405.01), respectively. The same trend is followed as for binding Ab 
titers against the WA-1 antigen.  
Baseline antibody titers to the Delta and Alpha variants, analyzed with the 10
plex ECLIA assay, are 
lower compared to the WA-1 antigen. After boosting with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, GMT increased, 
reaching the highest Ab levels against both variants in the group who received Spikevax as primary 
‐
vaccination, followed by the group who received Comirnaty, and Ab levels were lowest in the 
homologous booster group.  
Overall, for all the variants, no meaningful differences are observed between the two age groups (18 – 
55 yoa and ≥56 yoa) in pre- and post-boost binding Ab GMTs, with 95% CIs always largely 
overlapping. 
The publication of Atmar et al. (see above) also includes data on binding Ab in the groups who were 
boosted with an mRNA vaccine after primary vaccination with either of the 3 vaccines. Neutralizing Ab 
titers are presented in Binding Antibody Units (BAU)/mL, instead of IU50/mL, by using a conversion 
factor of 0.009. In participants primary vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, binding Ab GMTs 
(95% CI) to WA-1 antigen on Day 15 are much higher after a heterologous boost with an mRNA 
vaccine (Spikevax: 3203.1 BAU/mL [2499.5 – 4104.9]; Comirnaty: 2549.5 BAU/mL [2038.1 – 
3189.3]) compared to a homologous boost (326.0 BAU/mL [235.8 – 450.7]). Similarly, also for 
participants who received an mRNA vaccine as primary vaccination, boosting with an mRNA vaccine 
results in much higher binding Ab levels compared to boosting with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. This is 
not only the case for the WA-1 antigen, but also for B.1617.2 (Delta).

Table 9 Variants of Concern: IgG Serum Binding Antibody Response to S-2P-B.1.617.2 (Delta Variant) 
by FFP 10-plex ECLIA. Results are reported as Area Under Curve (AUC) 
3.4.  Discussion 
Results from several studies were included as key data to support of the proposed homologous booster 
Variation: the First-in-human trial COV1001, Phase 1 and 2 studies COV1002 and COV2001 and the 
Phase 3 trial COV3009.  
•  Study COV1001 is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2a 
multicenter FIH dose selection study conducted in adults aged 18 to 55 years and aged 65 
years or older in Belgium and in the US. This study also includes evaluation of a single booster 
vaccination. 
•  Study COV1002 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial in adults aged 
20 to 55 years and 65 years or older. Two dose levels were tested in a 2-dose schedule in 
Japan.  
•  Study COV2001 is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
Phase 2a study conducted in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Healthy adolescents (12 to 
17 yoa), adults aged 18 to 55 years, and adults aged 65 years and older were enrolled. 
Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in 1- and 2-dose vaccination regimen is evaluated across a 
range of dose levels and vaccination intervals. The primary vaccination is followed by a single 
low-dose immunization after 4 months (2-dose regimen) or 6 months (single-dose regimen) to 
assess the immune memory. 
•  Study COV3009 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-country trial Phase 3 
study to assess the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose Ad26.COV2.S, given 56 
days apart, for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and 
older. Complete immunogenicity results of COV3009, including a higher number of samples, as 
well as longer-term timepoints (e.g. 6-months post-dose 2), are expected to be available for 
MAH assessment in Q2 2022. 
Data from the dedicated booster study conducted by the MAH (COV2008) are not not yet available. 
This study is ongoing and is assessing the immune responses following administration of a boost with 
the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in individuals vaccinated at least 6 months before with a single dose of 
the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen or with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, Comirnaty. Results of the primary 
analysis of COV2008 are expected to be available by February/March 2022. However, preliminary 
results from the study COV2008 were submitted during the procedure. See below ‘Immune responses 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 39/151 
 
 
 
 
following 1 dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in subjects primary vaccinated with mRNA vaccines’. 
Data on the durability of the immune responses from the COV3001 are not submitted yet. 
Study results from the Phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012, an ongoing heterologous platform boost 
study conducted by NIH/NIAID in the US (also referred to as Mix and Match study, published in Atmar 
and Lyke 2021) were also included and supports this variation. The MAH presented data from the 
groups who received one dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen as booster vaccination. Additional data 
(published in Atmar et al.) considered relevant are also discussed in the assessment. 
With the exception of study COV3009, the methods of the above-mentioned studies were already 
assessed at initial conditional MA. Please refer to the efficacy section for the COV3009 methods.  
Thus, the data package consists of data from different studies, each including a limited number of 
vaccinated subjects and that vary by timepoints (higher number of subjects at Day 29 than at Day 169 
for example).  
Long-term immunogenicity results following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp dose level 
was submitted to support the need for booster. The effect of a second/booster dose, given at 2, 3 and 
6 months after primary vaccination (at 5×1010 vp or 1.25 ×1010 vp dose levels) were evaluated in 
different studies. COV2001 is the only study where immune responses after booster vaccination can 
be compared between a 2- or 3-month time-interval since primary vaccination, within groups of the 
same age range. 
For most of the studies, neutralizing and binding Ab results are available, overall and by age category 
(younger adults of 18/20-55/59 yoa and older adults of ≥60/65 yoa). Limited data on the 
characterization of functional Ab (ADCP) and on cellular immune responses are presented for study 
COV1001.  
Most of the results are for the original Victoria strain. Limited results are presented for the variants of 
concern (VOC). There are no data for the Delta or Mu variant. 
The immunogenicity analyses are descriptive and were performed on the per protocol immunogenicity 
(PPI) population (i.e. all randomized and vaccinated participants for whom immunogenicity data are 
available), unless specified otherwise. Sensitivity analyses, based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) (all 
randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine), were performed for Cohort 3 
of study COV1001 and of Cohort 1 of study COV1002. This is because, due to a pause implemented 
across studies in the Ad26.COV2.S clinical development program, blood draw for immunogenicity and 
vaccination were delayed, for approximately 1 month, for the majority of COV1001 Cohort 3 (≥65 yoa) 
participants and of COV1002 Cohort 1 (20-55 yoa) participants. Blood draw and vaccination occurred 
according to the protocol for COV1001 Cohort 1a (18-55 yoa) and COV1002 Cohort 2 (≥65 yoa). 
Results can thus not be compared between both the younger adult and the older adult cohorts of each 
study because of the difference of the time interval between doses. Similarly, no comparison of the 
results obtained post-dose 2 either at 2 or 3 months post-dose 1 can be made since the age groups 
were not comparable between schedule. 
Immunogenicity assays 
Most of the nAb and binding Ab results presented for the parental strain were obtained by using the 
qualified wtVNA from PHE and the validated S-ELISA from Nelexis. Performance of both assays was 
assessed at initial conditional MA. Results obtained with the validated psVNA from Monogram were also 
presented but correlation with the wtVNA was low to moderate (limited n of samples include in the 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 40/151 
 
 
 
 
analysis). Results presented for the variants were obtained by using a developed psVNA by JBDA 
and/or a partly validated psVNA from Monogram. Both assays seem to lack sensitivity. Some results 
obtained with a S-ELISA developed by JBDA were also presented. ADCP and CMI data were obtained 
by using the same assays than those assessed at initial conditional MA. 
Study DMID 21-0012 results were obtained by using a validated psVNA from Duke nAb LAb and 4- or 
10-plex ECLIA assay at final stage of validation and fit-for-purpose, respectively, for the measurement 
of binding Ab specific to the parental strains or variants. 
A number of recommendations related to the immunologocial assays are introduced in this procedure 
(refer to Annex).  
Participant information 
Participant information for the studies COV1001 Cohort 1a (N=377) and Cohort 3 (N=403); 
COV1002 (N=125) and COV2001 (N=582) have been assessed at time of conditional MA. Since then, 
no additional subjects have been enrolled in these trials. There were no relevant differences in baseline 
or demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups, including placebo, in any of the 
studies/cohorts. Analyses presented in the variation include data of selected groups of each study. 
In COV3009, in total 31,300 participants were randomized and vaccinated in in the ‘Ad26 5x1010, 
Ad26 5x1010’ arm (N=15,708) or to the ‘placebo, placebo’ arm (N=15,592) in the double-blind phase. 
See efficacy assessment for further details. Whether the absence of differences are also applicable to 
the immunogenicity data set analyzed is not mentioned. In the current application, immunogenicity 
data of study COV3009 are available for a limited number subjects of the immunogenicity subset. It is 
expected that baseline or demographic characteristics for the immunogenicity subset will be presented 
when immunogenicity data are available for the whole immunogenicity subset. 
In the Mix and Match study, baseline characteristics of participants in the 3 concerned groups 
(booster vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen after primary vaccination with the same vaccine, 
Spikevax or Comirnaty) were similar: median age of approximately 50 years; at least 30% of each 
gender; and majority are white. The mean interval between primary and booster vaccination was 17.7 
weeks, 19.3 weeks and 20.6 weeks in the groups who were primary vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen, Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively.  
Results 
Immune responses following 1 single dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen  
Original SARS-CoV-2 strain 
The main data on the durability of neutralizing and binding Ab responses against the original SARS-
CoV-2 strain up to at least 6 months after 1 single dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (5×1010 vp 
dose level) are available from studies COV2001 (Group 5, up to 6 months) and COV1001 (Group 2 
for both Cohort 1a and Cohort 3, up to 8-9 months). 
COV2001 nAb data are available for 33 vaccinees, including 20 subjects of 18-55 yoa and 13 of ≥65 
yoa. Binding Ab results are available for 73 subjects, including 44 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 29 of 
≥65 yoa. COV1001 nAb data are available for 41 subjects, including 22 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 
19 of ≥65 yoa. Binding Ab results are available for 135 subjects, including 68 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa 
and 67 of ≥65 yoa.

Data up to 6 months are also available from 17 subjects of COV1001 Cohort 2a. Humoral and cellular 
immune responses up to 8 months post-vaccination are also available for 5 subjects of COV1001 
Cohort 1b.  
Based on the main data from both studies COV1001 and COV2001, which is limited, the humoral 
immune responses induced following the administration of 1 single dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine 
Janssen appears to be sustained up to at least 6 months. There is no clear decrease over time. A 
minor, and not systematic, trend for decreased Ab levels is observed at the later timepoints (6 or 8-9 
months post-vaccination) when compared to earlier timepoints (1 or 2 months post-vaccination). 95% 
CIs always overlapped. Based on available data, it is not possible to conclude if these observations 
suggest the start of a waning of humoral immune responses or are only due to variability inherent to 
the limited sample.  
Limited data from Cohort 1b and Cohort 2a of study COV1001 also suggest stable (or even increase of) 
immune responses over time post-vaccination up to 6 months.  
It is not known if the Ab levels will decrease or will be maintained after 6-9 months post-vaccination 
with 1 single dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, and if this will impact the clinical protection. 
Of note, the T cell responses appear to be sustained over time (based on very limited number of 
subjects of Cohort 1b). 
SARS-CoV-2 Variants 
Few samples from 18-55 yoa adults in Cohort 1a (n=6) and Cohort 1b (n=4) of COV1001 were tested 
for the presence of nAb against VOC.  
Overall, data suggest that the nAb induced by a single dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen have less 
neutralizing capacity against the Delta and the Beta variants compared to the original strain and the 
Alpha strain. nAb could still be detectable at 8 months post-vaccination, but not in all samples.  
As for the parental strain, it is not known how the Ab titers will evolve over time after 8 months.  
Immune responses following 2 doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen  
Original SARS-CoV-2 strain 
Data available 
Data on homologous booster vaccination 2, 3 or 6 months after dose 1 (with the dose level of 5×1010 
vp or 1.25 ×1010 vp) are available from studies COV1001 (Cohort 1a and Cohort 3, 2 and 3 month-
interval between doses, respectively; Cohort 2a, 6 month-interval between doses), COV1002 (Cohorts 
1 and 2, 3 and 2 month-interval between doses, respectively), COV2001 (Groups 1 and 9, 2 and 3 
month-interval between doses, respectively; Group 5, booster dose (second dose) of 1.25 ×1010 vp) 
and COV3009 (2 month-interval between doses). 
In COV1001, nAb results up to 6 months post-dose 2, when given at 2 or 3 months post-dose 1, are 
available for 24 participants of 18-55 yoa (Cohort 1a) and 21 participants of 65 yoa or older (Cohort 
3). Binding Ab results post-dose 2 are available for 70 participants of Cohort 1a and 71 participants of 
Cohort 3. nAb and binding Ab results are also available for 17 subjects of 18-55 yoa (Cohort 2a) up to 
1 month post-dose 2 that was given 6 months after the first dose. 
nAb and binding Ab results are available for 43 younger adults and for 48 older adults of study 
COV1002 up to 1 month post-dose 2.

Post-dose 2 immunogenicity data (up to 1 month post-dose 2) of study COV2001 are available for 75 
(45 subjects of 18-55 yoa and 30 subjects of ≥65 yoa) and 127 (79 subjects of 18-55 yoa and 48 
subjects of ≥65 yoa) subjects for nAb and binding Ab, respectively. Among the 75 participants for 
whom nAb data are available 38 and 37 received the booster dose (second dose) 56 or 84 days after 
the first dose, respectively. Among the 127 participants for whom binding Ab data are available, 80 
and 47 received the booster dose (second dose) 56 or 84 days after the first dose, respectively. 
Binding Ab results at 6 months post-dose 1 were also available for 50 and 27 younger adult and older 
adult subjects, respectively. 
Anamnestic responses after antigen presentation at a dose level of 1.25×1010 vp were evaluated in the 
participants of Group 5 of study COV2001. Binding Ab responses post-boost up to 1 month are 
available for 71 subjects, including 43 vaccinees of 18-55 yoa and 28 of ≥65 yoa. 
Finally, post-dose 2 binding Ab data (up to 14 days post-dose 2) of study COV3009 are available for 
17 and 15 vaccinated subjects of 18-59 yoa, without and with comorbidities respectively, and for 24 
and 22 vaccinated subjects of 60+ yoa, without and with comorbidities respectively. 
Humoral Immune responses up to 1 month post-dose 2 
Overall, a second vaccine dose of Ad26.COV2.S, given at 2, 3 or 6 months post-primary vaccination, 
induces an increase in nAb and binding Ab titers, when compared to pre-boost values, both in younger 
and older adults. GMTs increase, ranging from 1.5 to 4.4 fold for nAb and from 2.5 to 5.8 fold for 
binding Ab, between pre-boost and 1 month post-boost. 
nAb data of study COV2001 suggest a slightly added value of giving the booster dose (second dose) 
3 months, instead of 2 months, after the first dose. GMT tend to be higher at 1 month post-boost when 
given at 3 months versus 2 months post-primary vaccination. This was true for both the younger and 
the older adults.  
Limited COV1001 data obtained when the booster dose (second dose) is given at 6 months post-dose 
1 show an increase in nAb. GMT at 7 days post-boost are higher than those observed in study 
COV2001, for the same age group. 
As for the nAb results, binding Ab data of study COV2001 suggest a slightly added value of giving 
the booster dose (second dose) 3 months, instead of 2 months, after the first dose. This was true for 
both the younger and the older adults. Of note, when the booster dose (second dose) was given 2 
months after the first dose, a similar GMT fold-increase pre- to 14 days post- dose 2 was observed in 
study COV3009 when compared to study COV2001.  
The available data are not suitable to conclude on potential differences between the 2- and 3-months 
interval between primary and booster dose, as GMTs were not systematically in the same range when 
same populations (age range, comorbidity status) vaccinated with the same time interval between 
doses, were compared across studies. Responses were also variable between age subgroups when the 
booster dose (second dose) was given at the same interval post-primary vaccination. 
When the booster dose is given 6 months post-dose 1, GMTs observed 14 days after vaccination in 
younger adults were higher than those observed when the boost is given 2 or 3 months post-dose 1. 
Overall, although there is a trend for higher Ab GMTs post-boost with longer interval between doses, it 
is considered that no conclusion can be drawn since these observations are based on too limited data.  
In addition, whether the differences observed post-boost GMTs between age groups in study COV2001, 
and across studies, is due to the presence of comorbidities, higher or lower Ab GMT values pre-dose 2 
or to the limited sample size cannot be concluded. These should be confirmed when the complete data 
of studies COV3009 and COV2008 will be available.

Humoral immune responses up to 6 to 8 month post-dose 2 
Both nAb and binding Ab results of studies COV1001 and COV2001 indicate that the Ab levels 
reached post-dose 2, when given at 2 or 3 months interval between doses, decline over time. A two-
fold decrease was observed from 1 to 4 or 6 months post-dose 2. GMTs at 4 or 6 months post-dose 2 
were still higher than at 1 month post-dose 1.  
Functional Antibody Characterization up to 1 month post-dose 2  
The proportion of samples with detectable functional Ab (i.e. other than nAb and with a suggested 
role in viral clearance in vivo), as well as the median of response, tend to increase from pre- to post-
dose 2 in both younger (Cohort 1a, n=72) and older (Cohort 3, n=73) adults of study COV1001. 
Phagocytic score GMs (95% CI) observed 1 month post-dose 2 were similar for both cohorts, i.e. 
whatever the age of the participants and the time interval between doses (2 or 3 months). 
Cellular immune response up to 1 month post-dose 2 
Specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were analyzed for 39 and 40 participants of COV1001 Cohort 
1a and Cohort 3, respectively. Data observed on this limited sample size indicates that the second 
vaccine dose does not induce an increase in the CD4 and CD8 Th1 cell responses in younger adults. 
The proportion of older subjects with detectable CD4 or CD8 Th1 responses was slightly increased, but 
the median of response in positive samples remained similar as pre-dose 2. 
SARS-CoV-2 Variants 
Very limited humoral data are available for the Alpha and Beta variants (n=6) 14 days post-dose 2, 
given 2 months post-dose 1. Ab titers against variants increased following the second vaccine dose. 
nAb titers against the Alpha variant following the second vaccine dose reached a comparable level as 
observed for the Victoria strain following the first vaccine dose. nAb titers post-dose 2 against the Beta 
variant remained low. There are no data for the Delta variant, which is currently the dominant 
circulating variant in EU.  
The neutralizing capacity of the Ab induced by a booster dose, given 6 months after the first dose, was 
also measured in the samples of 17 subjects included in the Cohort 2a of the COV1001 study. nAb 
titers to the Gamma, Delta, and Lambda variants were measured by a developed, non-qualified, psVNA 
(JBDA). Data were also obtained for the Beta variant on the same samples with a partially validated 
psVNA (Monogram). It is likely that both the psVNAs lack of sensitivity. Measurement with a test with 
adequate performance, and correlated with the wtVNA, would have been preferred. 
Overall, for all the VOCs, an increase of Ab titers is observed post-boost, as early as 7 days after the 
boost. nAb levels observed 1 month post-boost for the variants are lower than for the parental strain. 
However, post-boost Ab levels for the variants appear to be similar or higher than pre-boost Ab levels 
for the parental strain. Noteworthy, the pre-boost Ab level for the parental strain was low, and the 
GMT observed at 1 month post-primary vaccination was <LOD with the psVNA (JBDA), which add 
limitation for interpreting the results. The Ab levels 1 month post-dose 1 are not available, with the 
exception of Ab levels for the Beta variant measured with the psVNA of Monogram.  
Limitations for interpreting the data following 2 doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen 
There are no results from a dedicated booster study COV2008, the study is ongoing.

The humoral immune responses elicited by a booster dose were investigated before immunogenicity 
started to wane. 
Results are from different studies, always with limited sample size, in particular for nAb (even no data 
from study COV3009).  
Most of the results are for the original Victoria strain. Limited data are available for the variants of 
concern. There are no Ab data for the Delta variant when the booster dose (second dose) is given at 2 
months post-dose 1. Only limited data are available when the booster dose (second dose) is given with 
a 6 month-interval and several limitations have to be considered. First of all, data are generated by a 
developed (non-qualified) psVNA that seems to lack sensitivity. In addition, immune responses for 
these subjects do not follow the same kinetics up to 6 months post-dose 1 compared to other studies. 
A post-hoc non-inferiority analysis was performed on 17 subjects that received a boost 6 months after 
the primary vaccination. Since pre-boost Ab levels were not declined compared to 1 month post-dose 
1, this analysis is not considered relevant.  
Data over a follow-up period of more than 1 month post-dose 2 are limited. A 2-fold decline of Ab 
titers is observed at 4-6 months post-dose 2 when the booster is given with a 2 or 3 month interval, 
while there is no decline in Ab titers post-dose 1. Whether Ab titers will continue to decline over time is 
not known. There are no long-term data when a boost is given 6 months post-dose 1. 
COV2001 is the only study that allows comparison of different time-interval (2 vs 3 months) between 
groups of the same age range. Data for the boost at 6 months post-primary vaccination are limited. 
Overall, data are too limited to firmly conclude on the optimal time interval between doses. 
CMI data are very limited and from 1 study only. 
The potential impact of vaccine-induced anti-Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity remains unclear and 
should be further documented. This can have its importance if regular boosters are needed. 
There are no established immune correlate of protection, although it is recognized that Ab are 
associated with protection. 
Immune responses following 1 dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in subjects primary 
vaccinated with mRNA vaccines 
Overall, data of the Mix-and-Match study (DMID 21-0012) indicate that neutralizing and binding 
Ab levels increase after homologous and heterologous (primary vaccination with Comirnaty or 
Spikevax) booster vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. Although the study was not designed to 
make comparisons across vaccines and strategies, the data indicate the homologous regimen with 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen induces the lowest Ab response. Heterologous boosting with COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen after primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine induces lower Ab levels compared to 
homologous boosting with an mRNA vaccine on Day 15. However, by Day 29, nAb titers are roughly 
similar in those groups, as nAb titers tend to further increase after heterologous boosting with COVID-
19 vaccine Janssen, while nAb titers decrease by Day 29 after homologous mRNA vaccination.  
These data are in line with the publication of Sablerolles et al. (not peer reviewed) describing results of 
the SWITCH trial in The Netherlands. In this study, healthcare workers who received COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen as primary vaccination, were administered a homologous boost or heterologous boost with an 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 45/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax) with an interval of approximately 3 months. On Day 29, Ab 
levels after a heterologous booster were increased to higher levels when compared to homologous 
booster with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. Limited data of an observational study in 55 subjects also 
support these finding, as they show an expanded breath of humoral and cellular immunity after 
heterologous JJ/BNT vaccination vs. homologous JJ vaccination (Huat NKK et al.). Results on 
heterologous priming with the other adenovirus based vaccine, Vaxzevria, support the above findings. 
The COM-COV trial, published by Liu et al., indicates that heterologous priming with one dose of 
Comirnaty followed by one dose of Vaxzevria induces much lower Ab responses compared to 
homologous priming with Comirnaty. Finally, the MAH shared non-peer reviewed results, including 
preliminary data of the study COV2008, with the Rapporteur (Tan et al.). Individuals primary 
vaccinated with Comirnaty, who received a homologous booster dose with Comirnaty after 6 months, 
had much higher Ab levels (neutralizing and binding) two weeks after the booster compared to 
individuals who received a heterologous booster with Ad26.COV2.S. However, at 4 weeks after a 
booster, Ab titers decreased in the Comirnaty booster group while Ab titers further increased in the 
Ad26.COV2.S booster group, resulting in similar Ab levels in both groups. Of note, the number of 
subjects included are very limited, in particular at week 4. These findings seem to be in line with data 
of the COV-BOOST study, published very recently (Munro et al.). COV-BOOST study is a multicenter, 
randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial of a third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19. 
Participants enrolled were 30 years and older, and were at least 70 days post two doses of Vaxzevria 
or at least 84 days post two doses of Comirnaty primary COVID-19 immunization course, with no 
history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within each site group, participants were 
randomly assigned to an experimental vaccine or control, including Comirnaty and COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen. Roughly similar nAb titers are measured 28 days after a boost with Comrinaty or COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen, 10-12 weeks after primary vaccination with Comirnaty, both against Wild-Type SARS-
CoV-2 and the Delta variant. Binding Ab titers against the WT virus are higher after homologous 
boosting with Comirnaty. Kinetics of the binding Ab response differ between booster vaccines, with 
high Ab titers being already observed as soon as 7 days post-boost with Comirnaty, whereas an 
increase of Ab titers is observed between day 7 and day 28 post-boost with COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen. 
The clinical relevance of the increase in neutralizing and binding Ab titers after a booster with COVID-
19 vaccine Janssen is unknown. CMI data are not available yet.  
As only short term data are available on heterologous boosting, long-term protection and 
immunological memory are currently unknown. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on limited data, it can be concluded that, after a single dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, 
there is no clear evidence of waning of immunity up to at least 6 months. It is not known how the 
immune responses will evolve over time and the impact on clinical protection. 
Most of the results are for the original Victoria strain. A booster dose (second dose) of COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen, given at 2, 3 or 6 months post-primary vaccination, induces an increase in both 
neutralizing and binding Ab, when compared to pre-boost values, in both young and older adults. GMTs 
increase, ranging from 1.5 to 4.4 fold for nAb and from 2.5 to 5.8 fold for binding Ab, between pre-
boost and 1 month post-boost. Functional Ab against the original strain, other than nAb and with a 
suggested role in viral clearance in vivo, tend to increase post-dose 2. CMI data are limited and do not 
suggest an increase in the CD4 and CD8 Th1 responses with a booster dose (second dose).

Limited data post-dose 2, when given at 2 months after the first dose, are available for the VOC (Alpha 
and Beta). The data suggest an increase in nAb. nAb levels observed 1 month post-boost for the 
variants are lower than for the parental strain at the same timepoint. There are no Ab data for the 
Delta variant when the booster dose (second dose) is given at 2 months post-dose 1. Only limited data 
are available when the booster dose (second dose) is given with a 6 month-interval (for the Beta, 
Gamma, Delta, Lambda variants), with several limitations for interpreting the data.  
There are no Ab data in elderly who received a boost at 6 months post-primary vaccination.  
Data over a longer period of time than 1 month post-dose 2 are limited. A 2-fold decline of Ab titers is 
observed at 4-6 months post-dose 2. Whether Ab titers will continue to decline over time is not known. 
Data are too limited to conclude on the optimal time interval between doses. 
Data indicate the homologous regimen with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen induces lower Ab responses 
compared to heterologous boosting with an mRNA vaccine. 
Current evidence suggest that heterologous boosting with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen after primary 
vaccination with an mRNA vaccine induces lower Ab levels compared to homologous boosting with an 
mRNA vaccine after 14-days, while after 1 month, neutralizing antibody titers are roughly similar 
between both regimens. 
There are no established immune correlate of protection, although it is recognized that Ab are 
associated with protection. 
Please, refer to the published EMA and ECDC recommendation on heterologous vaccination courses 
against COVID-19 and the SmPC for additional information.  
4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
In the context of this booster dose (second dose) variation, key data that support the variation for the 
booster dose (second dose) variation are the immunogenicity and safety data. Efficacy data is 
supportive of the variation.  
Preliminary efficacy results up to the end of the double-blind phase, which corresponds to the final 
analyses, have been provided for the Pivotal Phase 3 study COV3001. COV3001 (ENSEMBLE1) is the 
pivotal efficacy trial which assessed a single dose schedule and supported the MA. The results are over 
an approximately 4 months median FU period. Only TLRs are available for this final analysis of the 
double-blind phase. 
Preliminary efficacy results up to the end of the double-blind phase have been provided also for the 
Pivotal Phase 3 study COV3009. COV3009 (ENSEMBLE2) is the pivotal efficacy trial which assesses a 
two dose schedule. The data correspond to the primary analysis of the trial, which is also the final 
analysis of the double blind phase. Only Top line results (TLRs) are available, and genomic analyses 
are incomplete (68% sequencing).

4.1.  Design 
Design of study COV3001 
The design of COV3001 was assessed as part of the conditional MA. 
COV3001  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  Phase  3  study  performed  in  adults  ≥18 
years of age. The study was conducted in the US, several Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were randomized in parallel in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo intramuscularly. Participants with stable 
medical conditions were allowed to participate in the study, but those with an abnormal function of the 
immune system resulting from a clinical conditions or drugs were excluded. The target sample size for 
the study was approximately 40,000 participants. Randomization was stratified by site, age group (≥18-
<60 yoa vs ≥60 yoa), and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with an 
increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19.  
Following  Emergency  Use  Authorization  (EUA)  in  the  US  (on  February  27,  2021),  the  Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine  was  offered  to  participants  who  initially  received  placebo.  Therefore,  participants  and 
investigators  were  unblinded.  The  crossover  resulted  in  loss  of  placebo-controlled  follow  up.  All 
participants  were  encouraged  to  remain 
in  the  study  and  continue  to  be 
followed 
for 
efficacy/effectiveness,  safety  and  immunogenicity  as  originally  planned  for  up  to  2  years  post-
vaccination.  
The primary objective of study COV3001 is to evaluate the efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of 
molecularly  confirmed,  moderate  to  severe/critical  COVID-19  (with  onset  at  least  14  days  post-
vaccination and with onset at least 28 days post-vaccination as co-primary endpoints), as compared to 
placebo, in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults. The secondary objectives include the evaluation of efficacy 
in the prevention of molecularly confirmed: (i) severe/critical COVID-19, (ii) mild COVID-19, (iii) COVID-
19 as defined by the US CDC (FDA) harmonized case definition, (iv) all symptomatic COVID-19 (meeting 
the mild, moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 case definition), in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults, (v) 
COVID-19 requiring medical intervention. In addition, the evaluation of the effect of Ad26.COV2.S on 
the occurrence of confirmed asymptomatic/undetected infections with SARS-CoV-2 (using SARS-CoV-2 
N protein seroconversion) was part of the secondary objectives.  
The case definition of moderate COVID-19 includes two sets of criteria using a combination of symptoms 
and signs. The MAH used a complex composite definition of moderate COVID-19, of unclear added value. 
Cases  that  would  be  considered  mild  disease  by  other  case  definitions  (i.e.  only  including  symptoms 
compatible  with  COVID-19  but  without  signs  of  LRT  involvement)  can  meet  the  protocol  definition  of 
moderate disease. 
The definition for severe/critical COVID-19 is in line with the definition of severe COVID-19 in the FDA 
guidance  on  Development  and  Licensure  of  Vaccines  to  Prevent  COVID-19  (June  2020).  All  potential 
severe/critical  COVID-19  cases  were  adjudicated  in  a  blinded  manner  by  the  Clinical  Severity 
Adjudication Committee (CSAC).  
The co-primary endpoints consist in a combination of moderate COVID-19 and severe/critical COVID-
19,  and  moderate  COVID-19  itself  is  a  composite  endpoint.  It  is  not  in  line  with  the  guidance  ‘EMA 
considerations on COVID-19 vaccine approval’ which recommends using ‘laboratory-confirmed COVID-
19 disease of any severity’ as the primary endpoint. In practice, the classification of the cases was very 
similar when using the primary endpoint case definition or the case definition of ‘all symptomatic COVID-
19 cases’, or the CDC/FDA harmonized case definition. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 48/151 
 
 
 
Design of study COV3009 
COV3009  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  3  study.  The  design  and  endpoints 
are similar to the COV3001 trial. 
The study was conducted in Europe and the US mainly, which is different from COV3001 that included 
no European site and was mainly in the US and South America. 
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 
vp 56 days apart or placebo intramuscularly. 
The sample size calculation for this trial was driven by the primary analysis which aimed to demonstrate 
VE>30% with the per protocol population. The definition of events was predefined as first occurrence of 
molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 in the PP population at least 14 days after 
the 2nd vaccination (Day 71) with study vaccine. The target sample size for the study was approximately 
30,000 participants (≈15.000 patients per group) and 104 overall events for the per protocol population.  
No interim analysis was planned to prematurely stop the trial for overwhelming efficacy.  
A graphical approach (Bretz et al, 2009) was planned to handle multiplicity along the primary endpoint 
and  the  secondary  confirmatory  endpoints.  The  primary  endpoint,  and  the  3  following  secondary 
endpoints covered by the multiplicity rules were significant: burden of disease endpoint, all SARS-CoV-
2 infections, and severe events; the asymptomatic infections and the need for medical intervention were 
not, therefore, any additional endpoint is not further covered by the multiplicity strategy. 
For both studies, participants are included in the analysis of the double-blind phase but are censored at 
the day of unblinding, the day of administration of another authorized/approved COVID-19 vaccine (if 
any, including Ad26.COV2.S if received outside of the study), the date of study discontinuation or the 
last available date (datalock point), whichever occurred first. 
Events that occurred after receipt of another COVID-19 vaccine (including the Ad26.COV2.S if received 
outside of the study) are tabulated separately. Placebo recipients crossed-over to the Janssen COVID-
19 vaccine (as part of the study) were evaluated in the placebo group for the time they were exposed 
under  placebo  injection  and  evaluated  in  the  vaccine  group  for  the  time  post  Janssen  COVID-19 
vaccination. 
4.2.  Results 
Phase 3 Study COV3001 
Criteria for analysis and subjects disposition 
The  primary  analysis  of  COV3001  was  performed  when  the  2-month  median follow-up  timepoint  was 
reached (database cut-off date: 22 January 2021). The primary analyses results are discussed in the 
conditional MA report. The MAH now presents the final analysis results of the double blind phase of the 
pivotal COV3001 trial which is assessing a single dose schedule. The cut off date is July 9, 2021 for this 
analysis with a median follow-up of approximately 4 months.  
FAS: 
In the final analysis results of the double blind phase, 43,788 participants were vaccinated (21,898 and 
21,890 in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo group). This constitutes the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
Unblinding and premature termination: 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 49/151 
 
 
 
Study participants who became eligible to receive an authorized/licensed COVID-19 vaccine according 
to local recommendation could request to be individually unblinded (Protocol Amendment 3). Following 
EUA approval, all participants were systematically unblinded (Protocol Amendment 4). Participants were 
encouraged to continue to be followed as part of the open label phase. 
Up to the cut-off date of the final analysis of the double-blind phase (9 July 2021), most participants in 
the  FAS  (94.7%)  were  actually  unblinded  (95.0%  vs  94.4%  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo  group, 
respectively).  
A slightly higher proportion of subjects terminated the double blind phase prematurely in the placebo 
group  (8.8%)  vs  the  active  group  (5.4%),  and  the  main  reason  for  discontinuation  was  receival  of 
another vaccine, followed by withdrawal and lost to follow up.  
PP set: 
The primary and final analyses of efficacy was based on the Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population. Of the 
participants  in  the  FAS,  39,185  (19,577  and  19,608  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo  group)  were 
included in the PP set.). Baseline seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was the main reason for elimination from 
the  PP  set.  Other  reasons  were  being  PCR  positive  at  baseline  or  protocol  deviations.  Reasons  for 
elimination from the PP were balanced across groups.  
Follow up period: 
The median follow up after double blind vaccination was 4 months (123 days in the FAS and 121 days 
[min-max]: 1-284 days in the PP). Overall, 22.8% of the participants (23.5% vs. 22.2% in the active vs 
placebo group) had a follow up of at least 6 months (defined as 24 weeks) in the PP. The median follow 
up was 122 days and 120 days in the active vs the placebo group (PP). 
The study introduced the possibility to cross-over to the Janssen vaccine for the placebo subjects, so all 
subjects were unblinded at a schedule study visit after EUA, which explains the short FU period.  
The length of follow up varied across countries, and according to baseline characteristics. This is because: 
(i) Enrolment started at different time across countries (first in the US, with other countries following 
later at various periods), (ii) Safety pauses occurred at different time across countries, (iii) Per study 
design, elderly participants and participants with comorbidities were enrolled later, (iv) Calendar time at 
unblinding of participants differed across countries. This resulted in differences in the person-years of 
follow-up for case accrual between subgroups. This has an important impact on the time to follow-up in 
some subgroups, such as the elderly. There are also differences in terms of vaccination periods across 
countries and subgroups. This could also lead to biased efficacy estimates in the subgroups, also given 
different variant pattern across countries and time calendar.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics  
The study was conducted in the United States (44.1% of the FAS), various countries of Latin America 
(40.9% of the FAS, from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile and Mexico), and South Africa (15.0% 
of the FAS). There was no European site in this study.  
In the FAS, 4,275 (9.8%) of participants were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline. 
The median age of individuals was 52.0 years (range: 18-100), 33.5% of the participants were 60 yoa 
or more, and 42.0% has comorbidities putting them at risk of severe COVID19 (FAS). 
The proportion of participants ≥60 years was 35% (in the PP) and the proportion of participants ≥65 
years was 20%. The proportion of participants ≥75 years was however limited (4% in the PP).

There were only few long term care residents: 0.3% (n=63) vs. 0.4% (n=85) in respective groups (FAS). 
Participants with comorbidities were well represented. At least one comorbidity was present in 40% (PP), 
the most common being obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 28%-29% in the PP-FAS), hypertension (10%) and 
type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (7.5%),  followed  by  serious  heart  conditions  (2.5%),  HIV  infection  (2.5%), 
asthma (1.5%), COPD (1%). Only very few participants presented comorbidities that are susceptible to 
significantly  affect  the  immune  system  (0.2%  immunodeficiency  condition,  <0.1%  secondary 
immunodeficiency, 0.5% malignant neoplasm and 0.5% chronic kidney disease). Only 3% of the subject 
present  3  or  more  comorbidities  at  baseline.  The  MAH  is  planning  an  immunogenicity  study  in 
immunocompromised individuals in the PM period.  
Baseline characteristics were well balanced across arms, overall and within regions. 
Variants circulation 
Of the 2056cases (including mild and asymptomatic cases) that occurred during the double-blind phase 
of the study as of Day 1, 1836 (89%) have sequencing data available.  
The final CSR will include sequencing data from all available cases in the double blind phase up to the 
cut-off date 9 July 2021. 
During  the  observation  period,  new  SARS-CoV-2  variants  emerged,  with  important  variations  across 
countries and over time. 
There  was  a  diversity  of  variants,  with  no  dominating  variant  over  the  study  period.  Overall,  cases 
included  the  reference  sequence  (14%)  (mainly  in  the  US),  the  Gamma/P1  (13%),  and  the  Zeta/P2 
(11%), Beta/B.1.351 (8%), Mu/B.1.621 (7%), Lambda/C.37 (6%), and other variants, such as Epsilon 
(California,  B.1.427/429).  There  were  very  limited  cases  of  Alpha/B.1.1.7  (3%)  and  Delta/B.1.617.2 
(2%). In the PP, the circulating variants over the period were the same: reference sequence (9%), the 
Gamma/P1 (12%), and the Zeta/P2 (8%), Beta/B.1.351 (6%), Mu/B.1.621 (6%), Lambda/C.37 (6%). 
There were very limited cases of Alpha (2%) and Delta (1%) (Figure 17). 
All  over  the  trial  COV3001,  there  is  a  high  proportion  of  the  other  mutations  category  (30%),which 
includes all variants that were not labelled as Reference (Wuhan+D614G), VOC (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, 
or Delta), VOI (Lambda, or Mu), or any other variant with significant presence in any of the participating 
countries that might have been classified as VOI previously (such as P.2/Zeta in Brazil, or P.3/Theta in 
Philippines), and without E484K, at the time of the analysis. 
There were 258 sequences classified as “Other” in study COV3001. In study COV3009, 47 of the available 
sequences were classified as “Other”. 
The  MAH  explained  that  he  variation  of  the  “Other”  category  between  countries  and  between studies 
(COV3001 versus COV3009) is likely due to a different epidemiology of those strains versus the different 
VOC/VOIs.  The  gradually  decreasing  numbers  in  the  “Other”  category  could  be  explained  by  a  lower 
transmissibility and lower resistance to neutralization of these strains leading to a replacement by the 
circulating VOC/VOI. 
The variants evolved a lot over time. At the beginning of the period, the referent variant was predominant 
(mainly in the US), as well as the Beta/B.1.351 (in SA), and the Zeta/P.2 (in Brazil). These were the 
main variants, for the cases in the primary analysis supporting MA.  
The reference sequence disappeared after 2-3 months, and several other variants are observed, such as 
the  Gamma/P1  (in  Brazil),  and  the  Lambda/C37  (in  Peru).  At  the  end  of  the  FU  period  cases  of 
Mu/B.1.621 (in Colombia) and Delta/B.1.617.2 variants (in SA) were observed.

 Figure 17: Distribution of Cases by Variant and by Country  
Co-primary and Key Secondary Endpoints 
The results for the primary and key secondary endpoints are presented in Table 10 for events with onset 
at least 14 days after vaccination and for events with onset at least 28 days after vaccination (co-primary 
endpoints). 
The point estimates of efficacy against symptomatic disease were lower at the final versus the primary 
analysis, while point estimates of efficacy against severe disease were similar at the primary and the 
final analysis. 
Events with an onset at least 14 days after vaccination: 
In total, 484 vs 1067 cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (primary endpoint) occurred in the active 
vs the placebo group. For the primary endpoint moderate-to-severe COVID-19, which corresponds to 
symptomatic  COVID-19  (any  severity),  efficacy  was  56.3%  (95%  CI:  51.30;  60.84).  At  the  primary 
analysis, the point estimate was 66.9% (Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40). Point estimates were lower 
at the final vs. the primary analysis, but 95% CI overlap. There were only 26 additional mild cases, as 
the primary endpoint captured most mild cases. 
The number of cases was large, making the estimates robust, even for severe COVID-19 cases. At the 
final  analysis,  the point  estimate  of  VE  against  severe  disease  was  73.3%  (Adjusted  95%  CI: 63.94; 
80.49),  while  at  the  primary  analysis,  the  point  estimate  of  VE  against  severe  disease  was  76.7% 
(Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09). 
Efficacy estimates for COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, which in practice corresponds to COVID-
19 related hospitalization (see MAA assessment report) was 76.1% (95% CI: 56.86; 87.67). For COVID-
19 related death efficacy was 84.5% (95% CI: 47.30; 97.06). The point estimates were thus consistent 
with  those  for  severe  disease.  For  COVID-19  related  deaths,  this  was  based  on  3  vs.  19  events  in 
respective groups. 
Events at least 28 days after vaccination: 
There were 433 vs 883 cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. For the primary endpoint moderate-to-
severe COVID-19, (ie. symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity), efficacy was  52.9% (95% CI: 47.06; 
58.08). The point estimate is lower compared to what was observed at MA in the primary analysis after 
a 2 months median FU period. At that time, efficacy was 66.1% (95% CI: 55.01; 74.80). There were 
only 22 additional mild cases, as the primary endpoint captured most mild cases. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 52/151 
 
 
 
 
For severe COVID-19, the point estimate of efficacy was 75% (74.6% [95% CI: 64.70; 82.06]). It was 
85% at the time of the primary analysis, that is over a 2 months median FU period (85.4% [95% CI: 
54.15; 96.90]). For the hospitalized cases, the point estimate was 76%.

Subgroup analysis of Vaccine Efficacy Against Moderate to Severe/Critical COVID-19 
In general, subgroup analyses of the final analysis data suggest consistency of efficacy results across 
age categories and in those with and without comorbidities. However, data are limited in the very old 
participants (aged 75 and older), no efficacy data was obtained in frail subjects and long term health 
care  residents,  and  only  participants  with  stable  conditions  were  enrolled.  Data  are  thus  lacking  in 
individuals with uncontrolled underlying disease and in those with several underlying diseases. There is 
no data on immunocompromised persons due to condition or immunosuppressive therapies. Efficacy was 
lower in HIV+ participants, but numbers are small and data difficult to interpret without taking account 
of other characteristics and variants.  
Efficacy was much higher in the US compared to Latin America and South Africa. In the US, VE against 
moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was 73% for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, 
and similar to what was observed during the primary analysis (cut off, 22 Jan 2021). But the FU period 
is  very  short  in  the  US,  and  unblinding  occurred  earlier.  Most  cases  were  captured  early,  and  the 
reference  variant  was  overrepresented  in  the  US  compared  to  other  countries.  The  most  important 
driving factor of VE is the type of variant. 
Efficacy estimates are systematically higher against severe COVID-19 compared to symptomatic COVID-
19. Despite lower number of cases, there is much less variability in the efficacy estimates for severe 
COVID-19  compared  to  symptomatic  COVID-19.  Subgroup  analyses  across  age  categories,  for 
participants with/without comorbidities, and according to region show fairly similar point estimates. 
Vaccine Efficacy by Virus Variant 
No analysis of efficacy per variant was performed at the ime of the initial conditional MA as the Spike 
sequence  data  were  available  for  only  70%  of  the  cases  and  a  higher  proportion  of  samples  were 
sequenced  in  the  placebo  group  as  compared  to  the  vaccine  group,  which  could  lead  to  biases.  An 
analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS-CoV-2 variant was planned upon completion of the sequencing. 
Sequencing as presented now is not yet fully complete. 
At  initial  conditional  MA,  efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  South  Africa  where  the  South  African  variant 
20H/501Y.V2  was  predominant.  Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  Brazil,  but  there  was  no  predominant 
variant in Brazil. Two third of the cases may be attributable to the P.2 lineage. 
After the primary analysis cut-off, the reference sequence disappeared and several SARS-CoV-2 variants 
emerged over time. 
At final analysis, efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate/severe COVID-19 was higher for the 
reference strain compared to pooled variant strains: 71.5% (95% CI: 57.31; 81.39) and 43.6% (95% 
CI:  34.19;  51.67),  respectively,  when  evaluated  at  least  14  days  after  vaccination;  58.2%  (95%  CI: 
34.96; 73.72) and 44.1% (95% CI: 34.35; 52.56), respectively, when evaluated at least 28 days after 
vaccination.  
For molecularly confirmed moderate/severe COVID-19 (ie. symptomatic COVID-19), variability in terms 
of efficacy against the variants is important. There is much less variability in terms of efficacy against 
the variants for severe COVID-19 than for symptomatic COVID-19, despite lower number of cases. The 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 55/151 
 
 
 
 
point estimate of efficacy against severe COVID-19 was higher for the reference variant (around 90%) 
compared to all other variants pooled (around 70%). 
A summary of vaccine efficacy against symptomatic and severe COVID 19 by variant strain 14 days and 
28 days following a single-dose is provided in Table 13.

Vaccine Efficacy Against COVID-19 Requiring Medical Intervention and COVID-19 related 
Death 
Of the 484 vs 1067 molecularly confirmed COVID-19 moderate-to-severe COVID-19 cases that occurred 
respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group at least 14 days after vaccination, only 18 vs 
74 cases required medical intervention (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ECMO). 
In summary, respectively 5/18 cases in the vaccine group and 17/74 cases in the placebo group required 
ICU admission, 4/18 (Ad26) and 8/74 (placebo) required mechanical ventilation and no cases were noted 
with ECMO.  
Vaccine Efficacy against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections 
Undetected/asymptomatic  COVID-19  cases  were  ascertained  either  based  on  serologic  testing 
(seroconversion  to  the  SARS-COV-2  N  protein  based  on  a  Nucleoprotein  assay)  or  a  positive  PCR.  In 
practice, the majority were detected by seroconversion, as serologic testing was done in all participants 
at regular timepoints. 
At the time of the final analysis of the double-blind phase, the estimated VE (adjusted 95% CI) against 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (at least 29 days after vaccination), was 28.9% (19.99; 36.78) as 
of 28 days after vaccination. 
Onset and Durability of Protection  
KM curves indicate that for symptomatic COVID-19, the onset of protection is 14 days after vaccination 
(see Figure 18).

with Onset at Least 1 Day After Vaccination by Serostatus; Per Protocol Set (Study

For severe COVID-19, the onset of protection might be slightly earlier, around 7 days after vaccination.

Figure 21 shows that efficacy against severe COVID-19 remains quite stable over time during 6 months, 
despite the appearance of new variants.

at Least 1 Day After Vaccination, PP Set (Seronegative; Study VAC31518COV3001) Final Analysis of 
Double-Blind Phase  
Efficacy by variants over time: 
Onset of protection by variant: 
It is not possible to conclude if onset of protection might be later for certain variants compared to the 
reference strain, as the cases appeared later in the study for many variants: 3 weeks after vaccination 
for Beta and Zeta/P2, 2 months after vaccination for Alpha, Lambda/C37 and Gamma/P1, 4 months after 
vaccination for Mu/B.1.621, and 5-6 months after vaccination for Delta. 
Efficacy over time by variant: 
To further characterize VE by variants versus waning over time, VE estimates against moderate/severe 
disease by time intervals and variants were provided. The MAH also provided KM curves over time for 
the variants.  
Efficacy data for the reference strain are available only up to about 4 months post-vaccination, and for 
the Alpha, up to about 5 months post-vaccination. It is not known if efficacy would decrease afterwards. 
Efficacy point estimates are low for Gamma and Lambda, whatever the time period (from 2 to 6 months 
post-vaccination). 
Still, number of cases and period are limited. Efficacy trends over time by variants are not robust data, 
and  do  not  allow  to  fully disentangle the  reasons  for  the  trend  of  overall  efficacy  over  time  (variants 
and/or declining protective immunity). Nevertheless, although limited data, both cumulative incidence

EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 59/151 
 
 
 
 
 
curves over time for the variants and exploratory analyses of efficacy over time stratified by variants do 
not suggest a waning of efficacy over the study duration.  
Vaccine Efficacy in Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Seropositive Participants 
In the 4,214 participants (PP set) with serological evidence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2), 
efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 was 76.2% (11.97; 95.70) when evaluated 14 days after 
vaccination (based on 3 vs 12 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group, no severe cases), 
at final analysis. 
The effect of natural infection was estimated to be around 90% in the placebo subjects (comparing 
incidence rates in placebo participants between baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative 
participants). 
Phase 3 Study COV3009 
Criteria for analysis and subjects disposition 
The MAH presents preliminary results of the primary/final analysis of the double-blind phase of the 
COV3009 (ENSEMBLE 2). The cut-off data for this analysis is 25 June 2021.  
Analysis sets: 
For COV3009, the primary efficacy analysis was performed in the Per Protocol (PP) Efficacy Set. 
It was clarified that both in COV3001 and in COV3009, the analysis for efficacy excludes participants 
with an infection within 14 days since the last vaccination. In study COV3001 there is no blood sample 
at Day 14, hence exclusion of participants is based on a positive PCR result prior or at Day 14. For study 
COV3009, in which there is a blood sample at Day 71, exclusion is done based on PCR as well as serology) 
test results of Day 71.  
An analysis was also done in a similar population, but who received at least the first dose of study 
vaccine in the double-blind phase, the Per Protocol First Dose Efficacy Set (PPFD).

major protocol deviations before unblinding that were judged to possibly

FAS: 
A total of 31,300 participants were randomized and vaccinated in the double-blind phase of the study 
(15,708  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  and  15,592  in  the  placebo-group),  which  is  corresponding  to  the 
target sample size of 30,000 (15,000 in each group). 
Individual unblinding and early termination: 
Of the FAS, 4.5% (n=701) vs 11.3% (n=1758) respectively in the vaccine vs placebo groups terminated 
the study prematurely during the double blind phase (mainly withdrawal). Withdrawal after having been 
unblinded was more frequent in the placebo group (748 in the placebo group and 468 in the Ad26 group). 
Treatment discontinuation concerned participants that did not receive their booster dose (second dose) 
13.5% (n=2124) vs 24.0% (n=3744) terminated the treatment participation prematurely during the 
double-blind  phase  of  the  trial,  respectively  in  the  vaccine  vs  placebo  groups.  One  of  the  reason  for 
discontinuation of the study vaccine was administration of another COVID-19 vaccine received outside 
of the study (279 and 1,420 in the Ad26 group and placebo group, respectively). More participants in 
the placebo group were not allowed to receive the booster dose (second dose) in the double-blind phase 
of the study (treatment discontinuation) because they received a COVID-19 vaccine outside of the study 
(1,420 in the placebo group versus 279 in the vaccine group). 
The proportion of participants who were unblinded prematurely before the unblinding visit was balanced 
(4,267 ie. 27.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S arm and 4,680 ie. 30.0% in the placebo arm). 
Unblinding after Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) 
Participants could be unblinded as soon as eligible for another authorized/approved vaccine. In addition, 
like  the  COV3001,  shortly  following  EUA  in  the  US,  participants  were  systematically  unblinded  at  the 
unblinding visit and those who originally received placebo were offered a single dose of the vaccine. Most 
of  the  participants  (98%)  were  actually  unblinded  at  the  cutoff  date  for  the  final  analysis.  Placebo 
subjects  were  offered  Ad26.COV2.S  during  the  open-label  phase  of  the  trial.  Overall,  7,667  from  the 
placebo group (49%) actually received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. 
Participants (also those who crossed over) continue to be followed in the open-label phase of the study. 
This resulted in a short follow up time up in the blind phase, and also in a large proportion of the subjects 
who did not receive their booster dose (second dose) yet when unblinding occurred. Participants in the 
active  arm  who  had  not  yet  received  their  second  vaccination  at  the  time  of  unblinding  received  the 
second vaccination in an open-label fashion. About half of the subjects received only one dose, and about 
half received their two doses during the blind phase (see below impact on PP set). 
PP set: 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the Per Protocol (PP) Set which includes participants who 
received both study vaccines in the double-blind phase and who were not seropositive at baseline.  
Of the total of 31,300 participants vaccinated in the double-blind phase (FAS), 14,492 were part of the 
PP set (7484 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 7008 in the placebo-group).  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 61/151 
 
 
 
The main reasons for exclusion from the PP set were: receiving only the first vaccination in the double-
blind phase and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of first vaccination or within 14 days after the 
second  vaccination,  which  were  reported  for  14,549  (86.6%),  3,478  (20.7%),  and  1,819  (10.8%) 
participants,  respectively.  Other  reasons  (all  other  reasons  combined)  were  reported  in  9.3%  of 
participants.  Overall,  major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  3,109  (9.9%)  participants,  1,263 
(8.0%) in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 1,846 (11.8%) in the placebo group. In total, 7.1% participants 
in the placebo group received a disallowed concomitant treatment, mainly another COVID-19 vaccine or 
treatment, compared to 3.2% participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group.  
Approximately half of the subjects were excluded from the PP analysis set mainly because unblinding 
was  before  they  had  the  opportunity  to  receive  the  booster  dose  (second  dose).  These  participants 
received only one dose before unblinding. Participants who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S before 
unblinding under amendment 4 were not allowed to receive the booster dose (second dose) in the open 
label phase. Given the huge discrepancy between the FAS and the PP, this analysis cannot be considered 
as resulting from a randomized comparison, as only a limited non-random subgroup of the initial ITT 
population is included in the analysis. 
PPFD: 
Of the total of 31,300 participants vaccinated in the double-blind phase (FAS), 27,200 were part of the 
Per  Protocol  First  Dose  Efficacy  Set  (PPFD)  set  (13,578  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  and 13,622  in the 
placebo-group). 
Follow up duration: 
In the PP set, the median follow up after the second blind vaccination was only 36.0 days (min-max: 0-
172). The median was 36.0 days and 35.0 days respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo-group. 
29% had at least 2 months double blind follow up post-second vaccination. As a result, the number of 
COVID-19 cases available for evaluation of the booster dose (second dose) is limited.  
In the PPFD set, the median follow up after the first blind vaccination was 55.0 days (min-max: 0-219) 
and 49.5% of the participants had at least 2 months of double-blind follow-up post vaccination. The FU 
was shorter in the placebo group (median 58.0 days vs 49.0 days), consistently with the above data 
on withdrawal and individual unblinding. 
The follow up period is very short especially for the elderly who were enrolled in a second step and also 
unblinded earlier. So in terms of total person-years up to unblinding, elderly subjects are much less 
represented in COV3009 compared to COV3001.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics  
Of the vaccinated participants (FAS), most were enrolled in Europe (41.0%, Belgium, Germany, Spain, 
France, UK) and in the US (38.9%). Others were enrolled in Latin America (8.5%, Brazil and 
Colombia), South Africa (6.6%) and the Philippines (5.0%). Europe was more represented in the PP 
(51.7%), while the US represented 36.5% of the PP, and other countries 11.8%.  
There were 11% of the participants who were seropositive at baseline. 
In the FAS, median age at enrolment was 53 years (min-max: 18-99 years), and 36% of the 
participants were 60 year or more. Subjects were younger in the PP. The median age at enrolment was 
50 years (min-max: 18-99 years), and 25% of the participants were 60 year or more.  
In the FAS, 41.4% had at least one comorbidity putting them at risk of severe COVID-19 at baseline. 
In the PP, 36.5% had a comorbidity putting them at risk of severe COVID-19 at baseline (28.3% had 
one comorbidity, 9.3% had two comorbidities and 3.7% had more than three comorbidities). The most 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 62/151 
 
 
 
prevalent comorbidities were obesity (25.7%) and hypertension (12.3%). Of the FAS, 1.4% vs 1.1% of 
the participants were HIV infected, in the Ad26 5x1010 vs the placebo arm.  
Overweight (BMI 25 - <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) individuals were well represented in the 
trial, with 37.4% of the participants being overweight, and 26.3% being obese. 
No relevant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and 
the placebo-group in the FAS and the PP. 
Variants circulation 
A total of 469 cases occurred over the blind follow up period. Sequencing data are incomplete in this 
preliminary analysis and only available available for 319 out of the 469 cases (68%). It is important to 
note that only 66 (14 versus 52) of these cases were part of the primary/final analysis. Of these cases, 
also  66%  had  sequencing  data  available.  Therefore,  the  data  on  the  efficacy  by  variants  should  be 
interpreted with caution.  
The reference strain (Wuhan B.1 D614G) was still circulating at the beginning of the study period, and 
then disappeared. Overall, it represents only 19 (6%) of the circulating strains that were sequenced. It 
was observed only in the US where it represented 23% of the sequenced cases. As the reference strain 
was only reported early during the study, it is not present in the PP set.  
The  most  prevalent  variants  were  the  Alpha/B.1.1.7  and  Mu/B.1.621,  which  represented  respectively 
26% and 23% of the cases in the PP set. 
Most  cases  were  due  to  the  Alpha/B.1.17  (38%,  n=122  in  total;  26%,  n=17  in  the  PP  set),  which 
circulated all through the follow up period in various countries. The Alpha variant was seen everywhere, 
but represented most cases in Europe, and a large proportion of the cases in the US.  
There were also many cases due to the Mu/B.1.621 variant (14%, n=45 in total; 23%, n=14 in the PP 
set). The Mu/B.1.621 variant was seen essentially in Colombia where it represented most cases. 
There were a limited number of cases due to the Beta/B.1.351 in various countries (7%, n=23 in total; 
n=3 in the PP set). The numbers were even more limited for the Gamma/P.1 (4%, n=13 in total; n=1 
in the PP set) and the Zeta/P.2 (3%, n=10 in total; none in the PP set). 
There were also a very limited number of cases of the Delta/B.1.617.2/AY.1/AY.2 variant (4%, n=13 in 
total; 3 in the PP set), at the end of the FU period (mainly in SA).

Table 15: Summary of Vaccine Efficacy Against COVID-19 With Onset at Least 14 Days After Second 
Vaccination; Per Protocol Set (Study VAC31518COV3009) 
The analysis considers events that occurred at least 14 days after the booster dose (second dose) (ie. 
71 days after initial vaccination). 
In total, there are 66 (14 vs. 52) events of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (primary endpoint), with a 
point estimate of 75% (75.2%; 95% CI: 54.55; 87.30), for efficacy as of Day 71 (15 days post-dose 2). 
An inferential analysis was done, and the lower limit of the CI was above 30%.  
For severe COVID-19 cases, high efficacy (100.0%; 95% CI: 32.62; 100.00) is observed in COV3009, 
but the number of events is very limited (0 vs. 8), and the lower limit of the 95% CI is very low (around 
30%). It is not possible to conclude whether there is an additional value for two doses compared to a 
single dose in terms of severe disease.  
For asymptomatic infection, efficacy had a point estimate of 34% in COV3009. 
Vaccine efficacy by variants: 
The figure below provides a summary of the vaccine efficacy by virus variant for moderate to severe 
COVID-19 at least 14 days after the booster dose (second dose) in study COV3009.

Severe/Critical COVID-19 With Onset at Least 14 Days After Second Vaccination by Virus Variant; Per 
Protocol Set (Study VAC31518COV3009)  
Estimates could be provided only for the Alpha and the Mu variants in COV3009. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 67/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For events with onset at least 14 days after the second vaccination, efficacy for the Alpha/B.1.1.7 was 
(94.2%  [95%  CI:  62.91;  99.86]).  Therefore,  the  estimate  is  higher  compared  to  the  estimate  in 
COV3001, but with widely overlapping CIs. 
Efficacy  was not demonstrated for the Mu/B.1.621 variant in the COV3009 as the lower bound of the 
95%CI is below 0 (63.1 [95% CI: -27.86; 91.56]). Therefore, although the efficacy point estimate was 
higher  for  the  two  dose  schedule  trial  compared  to  the  single  dose  schedule  trial  for  this  variant,  no 
conclusion can be draw given the lack of precision of the estimate. 
There were only very few cases for the other variants. In particular, there were insufficient Delta cases 
for meaningful analysis (2 vs 1 for the Delta). 
Of the 66 cases in the PP, sequencing data were available for 45 cases 7/14 in the active group and 
38/52 in the placebo group. Hence there is an imbalance between the arms in terms of the proportions 
on non-available sequencing data (50% vs. 27% in the vaccine vs. the placebo group).

Vaccine efficacy after the first vaccination: 
After the first vaccination (events with onset at least 14 Days After First Vaccination; Per Protocol First 
Dose  Efficacy  Set),  efficacy  point  estimates  were  67.9%  (95%  CI:  57.95;  75.79)  overall,  which  is  a 
similar  point  estimate  as  in  COV3001.  Efficacy  was  75.9%  (57.91;87.02)  for  the  Alpha  variant,  and 
43.9% (-12.96;73.16) for the Mu variant, which is also consistent with what was observed in COV3001. 
Overall results PD1 are consistent with COV3001. It is assumed that those results are mainly reflecting 
efficacy of a single dose (and not the efficacy of the two doses), as the person-years PD1 to PD2 are 
overall more represented in the analysis compared to the person-years PD2.  
Vaccine Efficacy Against All Symptomatic COVID-19 and Any SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
Noticeably, efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least 14 days after the 
second vaccination was poor 34.2% (-6.44; 59.78), which is similar as in the COV3001. 
Subgroup Analysis 
The subgroup analyses do not raise concern of lack of efficacy for particular subgroups (including age 
group, conmorbidities, gender…) but the number of cases (length of follow up) was very limited in some 
of the subgroups. Estimates were very imprecise in the elderly (60 years or more).  
There are large regional differences in terms of efficacy were observed. In the US, VE (95% CI) against 
moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 at least 14 days after the booster dose (second dose) was 93.7% 
(58.45;  99.85).  In  the  US,  the  predominant  variant  during  the  study  was  the  Alpha.  Observed  VE  in 
other regions was lower (60.0%-68.8%), which was possibly driven by reduced VE against certain SARS-
CoV-2 variants. 
4.3.  Discussion 
The MAH started the efficacy trial COV3001 assessing a single-dose schedule at the end of September 
2021.  In  November  2021,  the  MAH  also  started  the  efficacy  trial  COV3009,  assessing  a  two-dose 
schedule  2  months  apart.  The  aim  was  to  propose  a  single  dose  regimen  for  emergency  pandemic 
situations, and a two-dose regimen for routine use after the pandemic. Based on their experience with 
the Ad26 platform with other antigens, the MAH assumed that a second vaccination may result in a more 
durable immune response. Because of the emergency situation, the MAH decided to conduct two trials 
separately in order to show efficacy as fast as possible for the single dose schedule.  
Available and expected data: 
Efficacy results are presented up to the end of the double-blind phase for the COV3001 study (single 
dose schedule) with a median FU of approximately 4 months (final analysis, cut-off date 9 July 2021). 
At  intial  conditional  MA,  data  were  submitted  with  a  median  FU  of  approximately  2  months  (primary 
analysis, cut-off date of January 22). The primary analyses results are discussed in the initial conditional 
MA report.  
The MAH also presents preliminary efficacy results of the primary/final analysis of the double-blind phase 
of the COV3009 (2-dose schedule) (cut-off date 25 June 2021).  
Additional analysis for all clinical trials are planned to be generated and should be made available (refer 
to ANNEX: New recommendations introduced in this procedure). 
Design of study COV3001: 
The design of COV3001 was assessed as part of the initial conditional MA. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 70/151 
 
 
 
COV3001  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  Phase  3  study  performed  in  adults  ≥18 
years of age. The study was conducted in the US, several Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were randomized in parallel in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo intramuscularly. Participants with stable 
medical conditions were allowed to participate in the study, but immunocompromised persons due to 
condition or immunosuppressive therapies were excluded.  
The primary objective of study COV3001 is to evaluate the efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of 
molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe COVID-19 (with onset at least 14 days post-vaccination and 
with onset at least 28 days post-vaccination as co-primary endpoints), as compared to placebo, in SARS-
CoV-2 seronegative adults.  
The  co-primary  endpoints  consist  in  a  combination  of  moderate  COVID-19  and  severe  COVID-19.  In 
practice, the classification of the cases was very similar when using the primary endpoint case definition 
or the case definition of ‘all symptomatic COVID-19 cases’ used for other vaccines. 
Moderate  COVID-19  is  a  composite  endpoint  which  in  practice  also  includes  cases  that  would  be 
considered mild by other definitions. The definition for severe COVID-19 is in line with the definition of 
severe COVID-19 in the FDA guidance on Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 
(June 2020). All potential severe/critical COVID-19 cases were adjudicated in a blinded manner by the 
Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (CSAC).  
The secondary objectives include the evaluation of efficacy in the prevention of molecularly confirmed 
severe 
COVID-19 
and 
COVID-19 
requiring  medical 
intervention, 
and 
confirmed 
asymptomatic/undetected infections with SARS-CoV-2 (using SARS-CoV-2 N protein seroconversion).  
Design of study COV3009: 
COV3009 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. The design and endpoints 
are similar to the COV3001 trial. The study was conducted in Europe and the US mainly, which differs 
from COV3001 that included no European site. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 
doses of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp 56 days apart or placebo intramuscularly. 
The sample size calculation for this trial was driven by the primary analysis which aimed to demonstrate 
VE>30%  with  the  per  protocol  population.  The  target  sample  size  for  the  study  was  approximately 
30,000 participants (≈15.000 patients per group) and 104 overall events for the per protocol population. 
No  interim  analysis  was  planned  to  prematurely  stop  the  trial  for  overwhelming  efficacy.  A  graphical 
approach was planned to handle multiplicity along the primary endpoint and the secondary confirmatory 
endpoints. The operating characteristics, the statistical assumptions and the planned sample size were 
reasonable and were expected to provide sufficient evidence basis for an adequate benefit/risk regulatory 
assessment.  
EUA and impact on COV3001 and COV3009: 
After  EUA  in  the  US  (February  27,  2021),  both  studies  introduced  the possibility  to  cross-over to the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. So, all participants were unblinded at a scheduled study visit and participants who 
initially received a Placebo were offered vaccination with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. The cross-over 
resulted in an important loss of placebo-controlled follow up. All participants were encouraged to continue 
to be followed for up to 2 years post-vaccination as part of the open label phase.  
Expected efficacy data, open label phase COV3001 and COV3009: 
COV3009 was designed to assess a 2-dose schedule vs placebo. It was not designed to assess superiority 
of a the 2-dose schedule vs a single dose schedule, or to make any direct comparison between a 2-dose 
and a single dose schedule. Still, in Amendment 4 (following EUA), it was planned that participants newly 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 71/151 
 
 
 
enrolled in the open-label phase would be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1 dose or 2 doses 
of  Ad26.COV2.S.  However,  the  sample  size  was  reached  during  the  blind  phase.  So  few  (n=334) 
participants were randomized between 2-dose vs 1-dose vaccine Due to small numbers, the comparison 
of those randomized groups will not provide useful data. A large sample size would have allowed useful 
data  for  a  direct  comparison  of  a  single  vs  a  2  dose-schedule  from  participants  recruited  in  parallel, 
within a similar epidemiological context. Instead, participants vaccinated initially with a 2-dose schedule 
in the blind phase will be compared, in terms of incidence rates, to participants cross-vaccinated later 
with a single dose schedule in the open label phase. The detailed assessment of the design and limitations 
of  the  open  label  phase  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this  assessment  report.  Nevertheless,  it  is  considered 
unclear if any robust evidence on the added value of the second/booster dose will be drawn based on 
these analyses, at least from the efficacy perspective, given the loss of a parallel control group, the loss 
of blind follow up, and given that a large proportion of the participants received a vaccine from other 
brands. Nevertheless, data from the open label Phase, including for the Delta period, may give some 
insight in effectiveness of a single dose and the added value of a booster dose (second dose) for this 
variant, and other variants in the future. 
At the moment, the interpretation of the added value of a booster dose (second dose) in terms of efficacy 
relies on a comparison across trials, which is associated with a lot of limitations, especially in the context 
of emergence of several variants.  
•  COV3001 
Study population, COV3001: 
In  total,  43,788  participants  were  vaccinated  (21,898  and  21,890  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo 
group) and constitute the Full Analysis Set (FAS) in COV3001. 
A slightly higher proportion of subjects terminated the double blind phase prematurely in the placebo 
group (5.4% vs 8.8% the Ad26 and placebo group). This was mainly due to receival of another vaccine 
outside  of  the  study  before  unblinding  (3.1%  and  5.6%,  received  another  COVID-19  vaccine  before 
unblinding. Moreover, 26% (n=5,712) of the participants from the active group and 27% (n=5,992) of 
the participants from the placebo group requested to be unblinded on an individual basis (but continued 
into the open label phase) and 670 and 1222 were vaccinated outside study (but continued the study) 
respectively  in  active  and  placebo  groups.  This  raises  some  concern  about  treatment  allocation 
awareness in the trial. 
The primary and final analyses of efficacy was based on the Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population. Of the 
participants  in  the  FAS,  39,185  (19,577  and  19,608  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo  group)  were 
included in the PP set. Baseline seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was the main reason for elimination from 
the PP set. Other reasons were being PCR positive at baseline or protocol deviations.  
The median follow up after double blind vaccination was 4 months (123 days in the FAS and 121 days 
[min-max]: 1-284 days in the PP). The median follow up was 122 days and 120 days in the active vs 
the placebo group. Overall, 22.8% of the participants had a follow up of at least 6 months (PP).  
The study was conducted in the United States (44% of the FAS), various countries of Latin America (41% 
of the FAS), and South Africa (15% of the FAS). The proportion of participants ≥60 years was 35% (in 
the PP). There were only few long term care residents (0.3% in the FAS). Participants with comorbidities 
were  well  represented.  At  least  one  comorbidity  was  present  in  40%  (PP),  the  most  common  being 
obesity  (BMI  ≥30  kg/m2,  28%),  hypertension  (10%)  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (7.5%).  Only 
participants  with  stable  conditions  were  enrolled  and  immunocompromised  persons  were  excluded. 
Baseline characteristics were well balanced across arms, overall and within regions.

Variant circulation, COV3001: 
During  the  double  blind  observation  period,  new  SARS-CoV-2  variants  emerged,  with  important 
variations across countries and over time. There was a diversity of variants, with no dominating variant 
over the study period. Overall, cases included the reference sequence (14%), the Gamma/P1 (13%), 
and the Zeta/P2 (11%), Beta/B.1.351 (8%), Mu/B.1.621 (7%), Lambda/C.37 (6%), and other variants. 
There were very limited cases of Alpha/B.1.1.7 (3%) and Delta/B.1.617.2 (2%). In the PP, the circulating 
variants over the period were the same.  
The variants evolved a lot over time. At the beginning of the period, the referent variant was predominant 
(mainly  in  the  US),  as  well  as  the  Beta/B.1.351  (in  SA),  and  the  Zeta/P.2  (in  Brazil).  The  reference 
sequence  disappeared  after  2-3  months,  and  several  other  variants  were  observed,  such  as  the 
Gamma/P1 (in Brazil), and the Lambda/C37 (in Peru). At the end of the FU period cases of Mu/B.1.621 
(in Colombia) and Delta/B.1.617.2 variants (in SA) were observed. 
Since the variants are extremely related to the period, it is not possible to fully disentangle the effect of 
the variants from the effect of waning of protective immunity per se. 
Key efficacy results, COV3001: 
Efficacy  estimates  are  systematically  higher  against  severe  COVID-19  compared  to  all  symptomatic 
COVID-19. The point estimates of efficacy against symptomatic disease were lower at the final vs. the 
primary analysis, while point estimates of efficacy against severe disease were similar at the primary 
and the final analysis.  
Symptomatic COVID-19: 
In total, 484 vs 1067 cases of moderate/severe COVID-19 (primary endpoint) occurred in the active vs 
the placebo groups >14 days after vaccination. At the final analysis, efficacy was 56.3% (95% CI: 51.30; 
60.84) and 52.9% (95% CI: 47.06; 58.08) respectively >14 days and >28 days after vaccination. At 
the primary analysis, the corresponding estimates were 66.9% (95% CI: 59.03; 73.40) and 66.1% (95% 
CI: 55.01; 74.80). There were only 26 and 22 additional mild cases (>14 and >28 days), as the primary 
endpoint captured most mild cases, hence corresponds to symptomatic COVID-19 of any severity. 
Point estimates were thus lower at the final (4 months median FU) vs. the primary analysis (2 months 
median FU), but 95% CI overlap. The disappearance of the reference strain and emergence of variants 
later in the study probably explains the reduction in efficacy estimates between the primary analysis and 
the final analysis, but waning of protective immunity over time might also contribute (see below). 
Severe COVID-19: 
The number of severe cases was large, making the estimates robust even for severe COVID-19 cases. 
At the final analysis, the point estimate of efficacy against severe disease was 73.3% (95% CI: 63.94; 
80.49) and 74.6% (95% CI: 64.70; 82.06) for events >14 days and >28 days after vaccination. Those 
estimates are in the same range as those from the primary analysis. At the primary analysis, the efficacy 
against  severe  disease  was  76.7%  (95%  CI:  54.56;  89.09)  and  85.4%  (95%  CI:  54.15;  96.90)  for 
events >14 days and >28 days after vaccination respectively. 
COVID-19 Requiring Medical Intervention and COVID-19 related Death: 
Of the 484 vs 1067 moderate/severe COVID-19 cases that occurred respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group  and  placebo  group  at  least  14  days  after  vaccination,  only  18  vs  74  cases  required  medical 
intervention. Respectively 5/18 cases in the vaccine group and 17/74 cases in the placebo group required 
ICU admission, 4/18 (Ad26) and 8/74 (placebo) required mechanical ventilation and no cases were noted 
with ECMO. Efficacy estimates for COVID-19 requiring medical intervention (>14 days after vaccination),

which in practice corresponds to COVID-19 related hospitalization, was 76.1% (95% CI: 56.86; 87.67). 
For COVID-19 related death efficacy was 84.5% (95% CI: 47.30; 97.06). Those point estimates were in 
line with those for severe disease. For COVID-19 related deaths, this was based on 3 vs. 19 events in 
respective groups. 
Vaccine Efficacy by Variant in COV3001: 
At  the  time  of  the  initial  conditional  MA,  no  analysis  of  efficacy  per  variant  was  performed  as  Spike 
sequence  data  were  available  for  only  70%  of  the  cases  and  a  higher  proportion  of  samples  were 
sequenced  in  the  placebo  group  as  compared  to  the  vaccine  group,  which  could  lead  to  biases. 
Sequencing data are now available for approximately 90% of the cases.  
At  final  analysis,  efficacy  against  moderate/severe  COVID-19  was  higher  for  the  reference  strain 
compared to pooled variant strains: 71.5% (95% CI: 57.31; 81.39) and 43.6% (95% CI: 34.19; 51.67), 
when evaluated at least 14 days after vaccination. For moderate/severe COVID-19, variability in terms 
of efficacy against the variants is important. Considering the events with onset at least 14 days after 
vaccination, the efficacy point estimates are good (approx. 70%) for the reference and the Alpha variant, 
as well as for the Zeta/P2 variant (approx. 65%). However, the efficacy point estimate was much lower 
for the Beta (approx. 40%), the Gamma/P.1 (approx. 35%) and the Mu (approx. 35%) variants. For the 
Lambda/C.37, efficacy point estimate was approx. 10%. The limited data for the Delta variant, also point 
to a signal of lack of efficacy (point estimate -6%). There were 11 Delta cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
versus 10 in the placebo group, which appeared late after vaccination (5.5 months up to 7.5 months, in 
SA). The limited data suggest a lack of efficacy for this variant, which would be in line with some studies 
reporting  Real  world  data  on  symptomatic  disease  during  the  Delta  period.  CIs  are  wide  for  certain 
estimates.  
Efficacy against severe COVID-19 could be estimated for some variants, and data suggest that efficacy 
is maintained for those variants with point estimates above 60%. For note, RWD during the Delta period 
seem to be in line with these observations. There is much less variability in terms of efficacy against the 
variants for severe COVID-19 than for symptomatic COVID-19, despite lower numbers. Nevertheless, 
the point estimate of efficacy against severe COVID-19 was higher for the reference strain (around 90%) 
compared to all other variants pooled (around 70%), 95% CIs widely overlapped. Estimates for cases 
occurring at least 14 days after vaccination were 89.7% (95% CI: 57.33; 98.84) for the reference variant 
compared to 70.0% (95% CI:54.72; 80.61) for pooled variants. It is not possible to determine efficacy 
against severe COVID-19 for the Alpha (2 vs. 4, in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus the placebo group all 
>Day 28) and the Delta (2 vs. 2, all >Day 28) variants because cases are too few. 
The CSR for the final analysis of the double blind phase will be finalised this year, and will include more 
complete genomic analyses (approx. 90% available now) from available cases in the double blind phase, 
up to the cut-off date of 9 July 2021. Data of the open label FU phase up to cut-off date of 9 July will 
also be presented in the CSR, including genomic analyses. 
Analyses for the Delta period will be provided from the open label follow up, including subjects vaccinated 
initially in the blind phase and later in the open label phase (vaccination of the placebo participants after 
unblinding).  
Onset and Durability of Protection, COV3001: 
Figures modelling efficacy over time and tables describing efficacy by 14 days intervals were provided. 
Symptomatic COVID-19: 
KM curves indicate that for symptomatic COVID-19, The onset of protection is 14 days after vaccination. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 drops rapidly after just a few weeks (around 1-2 months after 
vaccination).  This  trend  could  be  due  to  a  waning  of  protective  immunity.  However,  after  approx.  2 
months,  the  reference  strain  was  disappearing  from  the  trial,  and  several  variants  accumulated,  in 
parallel with the observed drop.  
To  further  characterize efficacy  by  variant  vs  waning  of  protection  over time,  exploratory  analyses  of 
efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 by time intervals and variants were provided, as well as KM 
curves over time since vaccination for the variants. The periods for which data are available are limited. 
Efficacy data for the reference strain are available only up to about 4 months post-vaccination, and for 
the Alpha, up to about 5 months post-vaccination. Nevertheless, although exploratory, these analyses 
do not suggest a decline of efficacy over the study duration. Efficacy point estimates are very low for 
Gamma and Lambda, whatever the time period. Hence, these data are suggesting that the overall decline 
is more likely due to the variants. 
In principle, it appears difficult to disentangle whether the loss of efficacy is due to waning of protective 
immunity  or  to  the  emergence  of  VOCs.  However,  based  on  the  available  data,  including  stratified 
analyses by variants, the trend is considered more likely related to the emergence of new variants with 
low  efficacy.  This  hypothesis  is  also  more  consistent  with  immunogenicity  data  showing  no  obvious 
waning of immune responses over time over 6 months (making the hypothesis of waning less likely).  
Severe COVID-19: 
For severe COVID-19, the onset of protection might be slightly earlier, around 7 days after vaccination. 
Efficacy  against  severe  COVID-19  remains  quite  stable  over  time  during  6  months,  despite  the 
emergence of new variants. Noticeably, RW data indicate that efficacy against hospitalized COVID-19 
remains  quite  stable  over  time  (also  against  ICU  admissions  and  deaths),  including  when  the  Delta 
variant  appeared,  while  for  SARS-COV-2  infection  or  any  symptomatic  COVID-19,  RWD  are  currently 
inconclusive (see RWD section). 
Vaccine Efficacy in Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Seropositive Participants in COV3001: 
In the final analysis, efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 was 76.2% (95% CI: 11.97; 95.70) in 
participants with serological evidence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2. This is based on only 3 vs 12 
cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group at least 14 days after vaccination, and the 95% CI 
lower  limits  was  12%,  well  below  critical  20%  or  30%  VE  thresholds.  Therefore  efficacy  is  not 
demonstrated in the individuals previously infected, although point estimate is consistent with that in 
participants seronegative at baseline. 
The final TLR/CSR up to the end of the open label phase, when last participant completes 18 months FU, 
will be available in the second half of 2022. 
It is unclear at the moment if the open label phase will bring relevant and useful results, at least from 
the  efficacy  perspective,  given  the  loss  of  a  parallel  control  group  and  the  loss  of  blind  follow  up.  In 
addition, it is assumed that a large proportion of the participants received vaccine from other brands. 
The design and limitations of the open label phase were not assessed in this report. 
•  COV3009 
Study population, COV3009: 
A total of 31,300 participants were randomized and vaccinated in the double-blind phase of the study 
COV3009 (15,708 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 15,592 in the placebo-group). 
Of the FAS, 4.5% (n=701) vs 11.3% (n=1758) terminated the study prematurely during the double-
blind phase (mainly withdrawal, which could occur after unblinding) respectively in the vaccine vs placebo 
Type II variation assessment report

groups. Withdrawal after  having been unblinded was more frequent in the placebo group (748 in the 
placebo group and 468 in the Ad26 group). Moreover, 13.5% (n=2124) vs 24.0% (n=3744) terminated 
the treatment participation prematurely (did not receive their booster dose (second dose)) during the 
double-blind  phase  of  the  trial,  respectively  in  the  vaccine  vs  placebo  group.  One  of  the  reason  was 
administration of another COVID-19 vaccine received outside of the study (279 and 1,420 in the Ad26 
group  and  placebo  group,  respectively).  More  participants  in  the  placebo  group  were  not  allowed  to 
receive the booster dose (second dose) in the double-blind phase of the study because they received a 
COVID-19 vaccine outside of the study (1,420 in the placebo group versus 279 in the Ad26 group). 
The  proportions  of  participants  who  were  unblinded  prematurely  (before  the  unblinding  visit)  were 
balanced (4,267 ie. 27.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S arm and 4,680 ie. 30.0% in the placebo arm). 179 and 
410  participants  (in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo  group)  were  vaccinated  outside  the  study  with  a 
COVID-19 vaccine before being unblinded. KM presented by the MAH suggest that the follow-up time of 
the double-blind phase in both the PP and FAS is similar across groups. Whether awareness of treatment 
allocation impacted the results remains unclear.  
In addition, like the COV3001, shortly following EUA in the US, participants were systematically unblinded 
and  those  who  originally  received  placebo  were  offered  a  single  dose  of  Ad26.COV2.S.  Most  of  the 
participants (98%) were actually unblinded at the cutoff date for the final analysis and 7,667 from the 
placebo group (49%) received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S during the open-label phase.  
The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the PP Set which includes participants who received both 
study vaccines in the double-blind phase, who are seronegative at the time of 1st vaccination and at Day 
71  (for  N-protein  ab  assay),  and  who  had  no  major  protocol  deviations  that  were  judged  to  possibly 
impact the efficacy of the vaccine.  
Of the total of 31,300 participants vaccinated in the double-blind phase (FAS), 14,492 were part of the 
PP  set  (7484  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  and  7008  in  the  placebo-group).  Actually,  unblinding/cross-
vaccination resulted in the exclusion of approximately half of the participants from the PP analysis set 
because unblinding occurred before they had the opportunity to receive the booster dose (second dose). 
This explains why the PP set is so limited compared to the FAS. Actually, only 54% (8,655 who received 
Ad26.COV2.S and 8,096 who received placebo) of the participants received 2 doses during the double-
blind phase. Other reasons for exclusion from the PP set are baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (11% 
of the participants) and major protocol deviations. Given the huge discrepancy between the FAS and the 
PP, this analysis cannot be considered as resulting from a randomized comparison, as only a limited non-
random subgroup of the initial ITT population is included in the analysis.  
Unblinding/cross-vaccination  resulted  in  a  short  follow  up  time  in  the  blind  phase.  In  the  PP  set,  the 
median follow-up after the second blind vaccination was only 36 days (min-max: 0-172, 36 days and 35 
days  respectively  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  and  placebo-group).  29%  had  at  least  2  months  double  blind 
follow up post second vaccination. As a result, the number of COVID-19 cases available for evaluation 
of the booster dose (second dose) is limited (see below).  
Of  the  vaccinated  participants  (FAS),  most  were  enrolled  in  Europe  (41%,  Belgium,  Germany,  Spain, 
France, UK) and in the US (39%). Others were enrolled in Latin America (8.5%, Brazil and Colombia), 
South Africa (6.5%) and the Philippines (5%). Europe was more represented in the PP (52%), while the 
US represented 36% of the PP, and other countries 12%. COV3001 also was conducted in the US (44%), 
Latin America (41%) and South Africa (15%). However, the proportion of participants from Latin America 
is much higher in COV3001. There was no European site in the COV3001. In the FAS, median age at 
enrolment  was  53  years  (min-max:  18-99  years),  and  36%  of  the  participants  were  ≥60  years. 
Participants were younger in the PP: the median age at enrolment was 50 years (min-max: 18-99 years), 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 76/151 
 
 
 
and 25% of the participants were ≥60 years. Participants were thus younger in COV3009 compared to 
COV3001 (where 35% of participants ≥60 years in PP).  
In addition, the follow up period is very short especially for the elderly who were enrolled in a second 
step and also unblinded earlier. In terms of total person-years up to unblinding, elderly participants are 
much less represented in COV3009 compared to COV3001. In the PP, 36.5% of participants had at least 
one comorbidity putting them at risk of severe COVID-19 at baseline. The most prevalent comorbidities 
were obesity (25.7%) and hypertension (12.3%). Only participants with stable conditions were enrolled 
and  immunocompromised  persons  were  excluded.  No  relevant  differences  in  baseline  characteristics 
were observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and the placebo-group in the FAS and the PP. 
Variants circulation COV3009: 
Sequencing data were available from only 68% out of the 469 cases reported, and 66% of the 66 cases 
that occurred in the PP. There were important differences over time and across countries in terms of the 
circulating  variants,  as  for  the  COV3001,  but  the  distribution  of  variants  is  very  different  than  that 
observed in the COV3001.  
The  reference  strain,  represents  only  19  (6%)  of  the  sequenced  case.  It  was  still  circulating  at  the 
beginning of the study period, and then disappeared. It is not present in the PP set. The most prevalent 
variants were the Alpha/B.1.1.7 and Mu/B.1.621, which represented respectively 26% and 23% of the 
cases  in  the  PP  set.  Alpha/B.1.17  circulated  all  through  the  follow  up  period  in  various  countries.  It 
represented most cases in Europe, and a large proportion of the cases in the US. The Mu/B.1.621 variant 
was seen essentially in Colombia where it represented most cases. There were very limited number of 
cases due to other variants such as the Beta/B.1.351, Gamma/P.1, and the Zeta/P.2. There were also a 
very limited number of cases of the Delta/B.1.617.2/AY.1/AY.2 variant (4%, n=13 in total; 3 in the PP 
set), at the end of the FU period (mainly in South Africa). 
Key efficacy results, COV3009: 
The number of events for the assessment of the two dose schedule is very limited (only 66 events instead 
of the planned 104), particularly in participants ≥60 yoa (n=15). This implies that no robust estimate 
can be provided within subgroups, by variants, and for severe disease. The short time of FU (36 days) 
also considerably limits the interpretation of the results of this study. 
Efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 was 75.2% (95% CI: 54.55; 87.30) for events as of Day 
71 (onset >14 days post-dose 2), this was based on 14 vs. 52 cases in the active vs. placebo groups. 
The effect (75%) is thus numerically larger for the primary endpoint compared to what is observed in 
the  COV3001,  which  was  67%  and  56%  for  events  with  an  onset  at  least  14  days  after  vaccination, 
respectively  over  a  median  follow-up  time  of  approximately  2  and  4  months.  The  difference  between 
both trials in efficacy point estimates is however not major, and the CI overlap widely.  
The point estimates are not better in the elderly in the COV3009 compared to the trial with the single 
dose, but conclusion cannot be drawn as numbers are very small (4 vs. 11 events). 
For severe COVID-19 cases, high efficacy (100.0%; 95% CI: 32.62; 100.00) is observed in COV3009, 
but the number of events is very limited (0 vs. 8),  and the lower limit of the 95% CI is very low. In 
COV3001, the point estimates of VE against severe COVID-19 were 76.7% over a median FU of 2 months 
(95% CI: 54.56; 89.09) and 73.3% (63.94; 80.49) over a median FU of 4 months (for events with an 
onset beyond Day 14). It is not possible to conclude whether there is a gain for two doses compared to 
a single dose in terms of severe disease. 
A graphical approach (Bretz et al, 2009) was planned to handle multiplicity along the primary endpoint 
and  the  secondary  confirmatory  endpoints.  According  to  the  plan  and  the  trial  results,  the  primary 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 77/151 
 
 
 
endpoint and “burden of disease” were analysed using a 95% two-sided confidence level, whereas for 
the rest of secondary confirmatory endpoints two-sided 97.5% confidence levels were used.  
Vaccine efficacy by variants in COV3009: 
Estimates could be provided only for the Alpha and the Mu variants. 
For events with onset at least 14 days after the second vaccination, efficacy for the Alpha/B.1.1.7 was 
94.2% (95% CI: 62.91; 99.86). Therefore, the estimate is higher compared to the estimate in COV3001, 
but with widely overlapping CIs. 
Efficacy  was not demonstrated for the Mu/B.1.621 variant in the COV3009 as the lower bound of the 
95% CI is below 0 (63.1 [95% CI: -27.86; 91.56]). Therefore, although the efficacy point estimate was 
higher  for  the  two  dose  schedule  trial  compared  to  the  single  dose  schedule  trial  for  this  variant,  no 
conclusion can be draw given the lack of precision of the estimate. 
There were only very few cases for the other variants. In particular, there were insufficient Delta cases 
for meaningful analysis (2 vs 1 for the Delta >Day 150). There were 13 cased of Delta in total, but all 
other  cases  were  asymptomatic  (5  vs.  5  in  the  active  vs  placebo  group  all  occurred  >Day  140).  So 
overall, there were 7 vs 6 Delta cases (symptomatic or not) >day 71 in the double blind phase of the 
trial, respectively in the active vs placebo group. 
Samples were selected for sequencing if the SARS-CoV-2 viral load result was available and was above 
1,000 copies/mL. No other criteria such as country or disease severity were used. Still, the sequenced 
subpopulation  cannot  be  considered  as  a  random  subsample.  Moreover,  of  the  66  cases  in  the  PP, 
sequencing data were available for only 45 cases, with an imbalance between the arms in terms of the 
proportions on non-available sequencing date (7/14 in the active group and 38/52 in the placebo group). 
Overall, estimates by variants could be biased. More robust efficacy by variant (on the complete cohort) 
are awaited for the double-blind (and open label) phase.  
Subgroup Analysis COV3001 and COV3009: 
In  general,  subgroup  analyses  of  the  final  analysis  data  of  COV3001  suggest  consistency  of  efficacy 
results  across  age  categories  and  in  those  with  and  without  comorbidities.  Despite  lower  number  of 
cases,  there  is  much  less  variability  in  the  efficacy  estimates  for  severe  COVID-19  compared  to 
symptomatic  COVID-19.  Subgroup  analyses  across  age  categories,  for  participants  with/without 
comorbidities, and according to region show fairly similar point estimates. The subgroup analyses do not 
raise concern of lack of efficacy for particular subgroups in COV3009, but estimates were very imprecise. 
In COV3001, efficacy was much higher in the US compared to Latin America and South Africa. In the 
US,  VE  against  moderate/severe  COVID-19  was  73%  for  cases  with  onset  at  least  28  days  after 
vaccination.  The  FU  period  is  very  short  in  the  US,  and  unblinding  occurred  earlier.  Most  cases  were 
captured early. The reference variant was overrepresented in the US compared to other countries and 
the most important driving factor of VE is the type of variant. In COV3009, large regional differences in 
terms of efficacy were observed as well. In the US, VE (95% CI) against moderate/severe COVID-19 at 
least  14  days  after  the  booster  dose  (second  dose)  was  93.7%  (58.45;  99.85).  In  the  US,  the 
predominant variant during the study was the Alpha. Observed VE in other regions was lower (60.0%-
68.8%), which was possibly driven by reduced VE against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
FU period in COV3001 and COV3009: 
In both studies, the enrolment period and follow up duration varied across countries, and according to 
baseline characteristics. This is because: (i) Enrolment started at different time across countries (first in 
the US, with other countries following later at various periods), (ii) Safety pauses occurred at different 
time across countries, (iii) Per study design, elderly participants and participants with comorbidities were 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 78/151 
 
 
 
enrolled later, (iv) Calendar time at unblinding and cross-vaccination differed across the countries (was 
earlier in the US) and age categories (was earlier in the elderly). In addition, the baseline characteristics 
and the variants circulation pattern varied across countries and over calendar time. This has an important 
impact  on  the  person-years  of  follow-up  in  some  subgroups,  such  as  the  elderly.  There  are  also 
differences in terms of vaccination periods across countries and subgroups. It is not clear at this stage 
how this could have impacted the efficacy estimates in the subgroups, and across variants.  
Vaccine Efficacy against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in COV3001 and COV3009: 
Undetected/asymptomatic  COVID-19  cases  were  ascertained  either  based  on  serologic  testing 
(seroconversion  to  the  SARS-COV-2  Nucleoprotein  ELISA  assay)  and/or  a  positive  PCR  (based  on 
‘accidental’  detection  of  asymptomatic  cases)  in  the  absence  of  COVID-19  signs  and  symptoms.  In 
practice, the majority were detected by seroconversion, as serologic testing was done in all participants 
at  regular  timepoints.  The  efficacy  (95%  CI)  against  asymptomatic  SARS-CoV-2  infection  was  28.9% 
(19.99; 36.78) after a single dose and 34.2% (-6.44; 59.78) after two doses, respectively in COV3001 
and COV3009. Therefore efficacy is lacking for asymptomatic cases, whether after a single dose or after 
two doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 
Efficacy conclusion: 
Results  of  the  final  analysis  up  to  the  end  of  the  double-blind  phase  are  presented  for  the  COV3001 
(median FU of approximately 4 months, cut-off date 9 July 2021). The MAH also presents preliminary 
results of the primary/final analysis of the double-blind phase of the COV3009 (median FU of 36 days, 
cut-off date 25 June 2021). The trials assess respectively a single- and a 2-dose schedule two months 
apart vs placebo. None of the trials was designed to assess superiority of the two-dose schedule over 
the  single  dose  schedule,  or  to  make  any  direct  comparison  between  a  two-dose  and  a  single-dose 
schedule. Based on the available data, it is not possible to make robust conclusion on the benefit of a 
booster dose given at least 2 months after a single dose of Ad26.COV2. 
Study COV3001 assessed a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S in multiple countries (US, several countries in 
Latin America, South Africa). There was a high diversity of variants amongst cases, without a dominant 
variant. A different pattern was observed with respect to efficacy depending on the endpoint. 
For symptomatic COVID-19, efficacy was poor over the approximately 6 months FU period. The estimates 
were 67% (95% CI: 59.0; 73.4) and 56% (95% CI: 51.3; 60.8) respectively in the primary (median FU 
2 months) and final (median FU 4 months) analyses. A drop of efficacy was observed rapidly (just a few 
weeks following vaccination), in parallel with the progressive disappearance of the reference strain and 
emergence  of  several  variants.  Although  it  is  not  possible  to  firmly  disentangle  the  role  of  waning  of 
protective immunity from the role of variants, the observed drop is considered more likely mainly due 
to emergence of variants with low/lacking efficacy. Waning of protective immunity over time might also 
contribute. Efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was good for the reference strain and Alpha variant 
but  very  poor/lacking  for  other  variants  (Beta,  Gamma,  Mu,  Lambda).  Only  very  limited  data  are 
available for the Delta variant and those point to a signal of lack of efficacy.  
For  severe  COVID-19,  no  drop  of  efficacy  was  observed  up  to  6  months  following  a  single  dose  of 
Ad26.COV2.S. Efficacy was maintained at 73% (95% CI: 63.9; 80.5) in the final analysis, despite the 
emergence of diverse variants. At the primary analysis, the efficacy against severe disease was 77% 
(95%  CI:  54.6;  89.1).  There  was  less  variability  in  terms  of  efficacy  across  the  variants  for  severe 
COVID-19 (compared to symptomatic COVID-19), with efficacy point estimates maintained over 60% 
for the variants for which sufficient data were available (Beta, Gamma, Mu). Still efficacy was higher for 
the reference strain (around 90%).

Study  COV3009  assessed  a  two-dose  schedule  given  56  days  apart  vs  placebo  in  multiple  countries 
(US, several countries in Europe and in Latin America, South Africa, Philippines). Alpha and Mu were the 
two dominant variants.  
Efficacy of two doses of Ad26.COV2.S administered two months apart was 75% (95% CI: 54.6; 87.3) 
against symptomatic COVID-19 over a median FU period of 36 days. Therefore, the point estimate was 
numerically higher compared to the estimate in trial COV3001 assessing a single dose, but CI widely 
overlap.  The  VE  estimate  against  Alpha  variant  is  higher  in  COV3009  compared  to  the  estimate  in 
COV3001 (with widely overlapping CIs). Efficacy was not demonstrated for other variants in COV3009.  
The  data  across  trials  thus  suggest  that  a  booster  dose  (second  dose)  at  2  months  could  provide 
additional protection against symptomatic COVID-19, but do not suggest a major added value.  
Beside the limitations associated with comparing data across trials, several important limitations have 
been identified in trial COV3009. Given the huge discrepancy between the FAS and the PP (approximately 
half of the subjects were excluded from the PP set), the analysis cannot be considered as resulting from 
a  randomized  comparison.  The  very  short  time  of  FU  (36  days  PD2)  (due  to  unblinding  and  cross-
vaccination) also considerably limits the interpretation of the results of COV3009. There are very limited 
data on severe cases and in elderly for the two dose schedule. Importantly there are limited data by 
SARS-CoV-2 variants, and very limited data on the currently most relevant variant which is the Delta. 
In  addition,  spike  sequence  data  were  available  for  only  68%  of  the  cases  with  an  imbalance  across 
arms,  possibly  leading  to  biases.  Follow  up  period  varied  across  countries,  and  variants  distribution 
evolved over time and differed across countries, which could also lead to biases when estimating efficacy 
by variants. All these issues raise concern on the robustness of the findings of COV3009, especially for 
the variants. 
Overall, the available data across clinical trials suggests that a booster dose (second dose) administered 
2 months after the first might provide additional protection against symptomatic COVID-19 including for 
variants, but do not suggest a major added value. 
5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
5.1.  Introduction 
Submitted  data  include  data  from  participants  who  either  received  a  primary  dose  and  a  booster  of 
Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp dose level, or 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S at the 1×1011 dose level with a 
2-  or  3-month  interval,  or  a  primary  dose  of  5×1010  vp  Ad26.COV2.S  followed  by  an  1.25×1010  vp 
Ad26.COV2.S booster 6 months later (considered supportive data) (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001 and 
COV3009). Preliminary safety data of an Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) 
administered at least 6 months after primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) vaccination are also 
presented (dose-level blinded data of study COV2008). 
The results of the safety analysis for the double-blind phase of COV3009 are discussed here. 
Updated safety clinical data has also been submitted for study COV3001 after 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S 
5×1010 vp. Safety data from COV3001 was the main data for initial assessment of conditional MA. 
Table 16 provides an overview of the number of participants who have received 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 
in studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001 and COV3009, by dose level and vaccination interval. It also 
includes numbers for those participants who have received an Ad26.COV2.S booster in study COV2008.

A total of 9,379 participants received a primary dose and a booster of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp 
dose level: 9,073 with a 2-month interval across studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV3009; 
128 with a 3-month interval across studies COV1001 and COV2001; 19 with a 6-month interval in study 
COV1001; An estimated 159 with a ≥6-month interval in study COV2008 (dose-level blinded data). 
Across studies COV1001 and COV1002, 235 participants received 2 doses of 1×1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S 
with  a  2-  or  3-month  interval.  Furthermore,  74  participants  received  a  primary  dose  of  5×1010  vp 
Ad26.COV2.S followed by 1.25×1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S booster 6 months later in COV2001. 
In  study  COV2008,  preliminary  dose  level-blinded  safety  data  are  available  from  a  total  of  370 
participants  (including  7-day  reactogenicity  data  from  244  participants),  who  have  received  an 
Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) at least 6 months after primary single-
dose  Ad26.COV2.S  (5×1010  vp)  vaccination  (i.e.  in COV3001).  Dose  level-blinded  reactogenicity  data 
are also available from 161 participants (including 7-day reactogenicity data from 76 participants) who 
have received an Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) at least 6 months after 
primary (2-dose) administration of Pfizer’s BNT162b2.

Clinical data from DMID 21-0012 study, cohort 1, groups 4E, 5E and 6E were also submitted: 
homologous or heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp at least 12 weeks after 
primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen (2 doses of Moderna-mRNA-
1273 or Pfizer/BioNTech-BNT162b2) or Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp. 
5.2.  Overall Methods 
Overall, adverse events (AEs) are being collected as summarized below: 
-  Solicited local (injection site pain/tenderness, erythema, induration (COV1002 only), and swelling), 
and systemic AEs (reactogenicity: fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, and pyrexia/fever (body 
temperature ≥38°C/100.4°F) from the day of vaccination until 7 days after each vaccination). 
Solicited local AEs were considered as related to the study vaccine by definition. Solicited systemic 
and unsolicited AEs were considered related to the use of the study vaccine as per investigator 
assessment. 
-  Unsolicited AEs from the day of vaccination until 28 days after each vaccination. 
-  All SAEs, including deaths, and AEs leading to study/vaccine discontinuation from the day of first 
vaccination until the end of the study. Any respiratory tract infection fulfilling the criteria of an SAE 
was reported as such during the studies. If the molecular test was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the 
SAE was excluded from the SAE analysis. 
-  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): suspected AESIs were collected from the day of 
vaccination until the end of the study/early withdrawal. At the time of initial protocol writing for 
COV1001, COV1002, COV2001 and COV3009, no AESIs were specified for Ad26.COV2.S clinical 
development. In April 2021, the Ad26.COV2.S clinical program was paused to evaluate a safety 
concern of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which was identified through post-
marketing data. At this time, all study protocols were amended to include TTS as an AESI. 
-  Adverse events of interest: AEs of interest were selected for further evaluation during the course of 
the clinical development, representing various diseases and conditions including, but not limited to 
severe allergic reactions (eg, hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis), immune-mediated and 
(neuro)inflammatory events (eg, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), Bell’s palsy). 
For studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV2008, safety analyses were conducted on the FAS, 
which includes all participants who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine (ie, active vaccine or 
control/placebo). For studies COV3001 and COV3009, the analysis of the double-blind phase of each 
study includes data from the Safety Subset (ie, a subset of the FAS) for the analysis of solicited and 
unsolicited AEs, and data from the FAS for the analysis of MAAEs, deaths, other SAEs and AEs leading 
to study/vaccine discontinuation.

For study DMID21-0012, AEs were collected as follows: solicited local and systemic AEs for 7 days 
following the booster dose; unsolicited AEs from dose 1 to 28 days following each booster dose; 
MAAEs, SAEs, new onsets chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), and AEs of interest from dose 1 to 12 
months post last dose on study. 
Of note, for potential TTS cases, the criteria for classification agreed by PRAC in the context of the 
Monthly summary safety review of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen are the following: 
5.3.  Study COV1001  
5.3.1.  Methods 
This is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, FIH Phase 1/2a multicenter study in 
adults aged 18 to 55 years and 65 years or older. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S are being evaluated at 2 dose levels, administered IM as a single dose or 2-dose 
schedule, with a single booster vaccination at 6, 12 or 24 months after the primary vaccination 
regimen administered in Cohort 2. The planned total sample size was approximately 1,045 
participants. 
Topline results (TLR) have been submitted (data cutoff: 21 July 2021).  
In each cohort, after the 1st dose, the median follow-up is between 223 and 268 days. After the 2nd 
dose at D57 (cohorts 1a, 1b and 2b), the median follow-up is between 167 and 203 days. After the 2nd 
dose at D85 (cohort 3), the median follow-up is 144 days. After the 2nd dose at 6 months (cohort 2a), 
the median follow-up is 41 days. 
5.3.2.  Results 
5.3.2.1.  Cohort 1a (Adults Aged 18 to 55 Years) 
Group 1 data (D1 and D57 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest (N=77 1st dose, N=74 2nd 
dose). Group 3 data (D1 and D57 vaccination with 1.1011 vp) are supportive (N=75 1st dose, N=74 2nd 
dose). The other groups are of less interest for the purpose of this variation.

5.3.2.1.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most of the 377 participants were white (91%), 52.5% were female and 47.5% were male. The 
median age was 34 years (range: 18-55 years) and the median BMI was 24.5 kg/m2 (range: 17-30 
kg/m2). These characteristics were similar in each group. The small number of SARS-CoV-2 
seropositive participants at baseline (3 participants in group 1, and 2 participants in group 3) 
precluded any meaningful conclusion to be drawn for this subgroup. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in groups 1 (35.1%) 
and 2 (33.3%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to groups 3 (60%) and 4 (56.2%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp); difference mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol and ibuprofen. In 
group 5 (placebo), the intake was only of 6.5%. 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was also lower in group 1 
(17.6%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 3 (39.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 
vp). 
The intake of concomitant medication was highest post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 for the 2 
tested doses. 
5.3.2.1.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (75.3%) and the 2nd dose (77%) of 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequency of solicited AEs ≥ grade 3 was higher after 
the 1st dose (9.1%) compared to the 2nd dose (1.4%) (all systemic). The frequencies of solicited local 
AEs and solicited systemic AEs were similar after the 1st dose (64.9% and 62.3%, respectively) and 
the 2nd (66.2% and 58.1%, respectively). There were no solicited local AEs ≥ grade 3. 
In group 3, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher after the 1st (90.7%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(81.1%) of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart), mainly due to the difference observed for the 
solicited systemic AEs (84% 1st dose vs. 68.9% 2nd dose). The frequency of solicited AEs ≥ grade 3 
was higher after the 1st dose (16%) compared to the 2nd dose (8.1%) (mainly systemic). The 
frequencies of solicited local AEs were similar after the 1st dose (76%) and the 2nd (74.3%). 
In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the 
study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In groups 1 and 3, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a 
frequency similar post-dose 1 (64.9% and 76%, respectively) and post-dose 2 (66.2% and 74.3%, 
respectively) (mainly grade 1 and 2). A trend towards a decrease in the frequency and severity of 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 84/151 
 
 
 
 
solicited local AEs with increasing age of participants was observed in all active vaccine groups post 
any Ad26.COV2.S administration. 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 1, the most frequently reported solicited systemic AE, fatigue, was reported with similar 
frequency post-dose 1 (46.8%) and post-dose 2 (48.6%). However, all other solicited systemic AEs 
were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2: headache (44.2% vs. 33.8%, 
respectively), myalgia (37.7% vs. 25.7%), nausea (22.1% vs. 6.8%) and pyrexia (14.3% vs. 4.1%). 
In group 3, all solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared to post-
dose 2: fatigue (70.7% vs 48.6%), headache (60% vs. 45.9%, respectively), myalgia (58.7% vs. 
44.6%), nausea (22.7% vs. 16.2%) and pyrexia (38.7% vs. 18.9%). 
A trend towards a decrease in the frequency and severity of systemic solicited AEs with increasing age 
of participants was observed in all active vaccine groups post any Ad26.COV2.S administration. 
5.3.2.1.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was similar after the 1st (14.3%) and the 2nd dose 
(13.5%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequency of unsolicited AEs ≥ grade 3 was 
higher after the 1st dose (1.3%: 1 hypotensive crisis) compared to the 2nd dose (0%). The frequency 
of unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (9.1%) 
compared to the 2nd dose (4.1%). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
In group 3, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was higher after the 1st (34.7%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(9.5%) of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequency of unsolicited AEs ≥ grade 3 was 
higher after the 1st dose (5.3%) compared to the 2nd dose (0%). The frequency of unsolicited AEs 
considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (24%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(5.4%). There were no fatal AE, but 1 SAE post-dose 1 (blood pressure decreased – not related to 
vaccine). 
Only chills was reported with a frequency of at least 10% in any group (15.1% in group 4, post-dose 1 
after 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S). Post-dose 1, chills was reported with a frequency of 3.9% in group 1 
(5x1010 vp) and 6.7% in group 3 (1x1011 vp). 
In group 1, the unsolicited AE assessed as related to vaccination were the following post-dose 1: chills 
(3.9%), pyrexia (1.3%), vaccination site swelling (1.3%), back pain (2.6%), hyperhidrosis (1.3%), 
sensitive skin (1.3%), diarrhoea (1.3%), eye irritation (1.3%), ocular discomfort (1.3%), 
oropharyngeal pain (1.3%) and hypotensive crisis (1.3%). Post-dose 2, there were: pyrexia (1.4%), 
back pain (1.4%), and headache (1.4%). 
5.3.2.2.  Cohort 1b (Adults Aged 18 to 55 Years) 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 85/151 
 
 
 
 
Cohort 1b comprised 5 participants in each group who were enrolled at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center (BIDMC) and for whom additional exploratory immunogenicity analyses were performed. 
Group 1 data (D1 and D57 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest. However, because of the 
number of subjects per group (N=5 1st dose, N=4 2nd dose), the relevance is very limited. Group 3 
data (D1 and D57 vaccination with 1.1011 vp) are supportive (N=5 1st dose, N=5 2nd dose). The other 
groups are of less interest for the purpose of this variation.  
5.3.2.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most of the 25 participants were white (88%), 56% were female and 44% were male. The median age 
was 42 years (range: 22-52 years) and the median BMI was 24.8 kg/m2 (range: 19-30 kg/m2). There 
were no SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants at baseline in groups 1 and 3. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in groups 1 (40%) and 
2 (60%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to groups 3 (100%) and 4 (80%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp); difference mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol and ibuprofen. In 
group 5 (placebo), the intake was of 40%. 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was also lower in group 1 (50%) 
(i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 3 (80%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp). 
5.3.2.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (80%) and the 2nd dose (100%) of 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (no AEs ≥ grade 3). The frequencies of solicited local AEs 
and solicited systemic AEs were similar after the 1st dose (80% and 80%, respectively) and the 2nd 
(100% and 75%, respectively). 
In group 3, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (100%) and the 2nd dose (100%) of 
1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local AEs and solicited systemic 
AEs were similar after the 1st dose (100% and 100%, respectively) and the 2nd (100% and 80%, 
respectively). The frequency of solicited AEs ≥ grade 3 was higher after the 1st dose (60%) (all 
systemic) compared to the 2nd dose (0%).  
In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the 
study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In groups 1 and 3, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a 
frequency similar post-dose 1 (80% and 100%, respectively) and post-dose 2 (100% and 100%, 
respectively) (mainly grade 1 and 2). 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 1, fatigue was reported less frequently post-dose 1 (40%) compared to post-dose 2 (75%). 
However, all other solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently (or similarly) post-dose 1 
compared to post-dose 2: headache (40% vs. 25%, respectively), myalgia (40% vs. 25%) and nausea 
(20% vs. 25%) (no pyrexia). 
In group 3, all solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared to post-
dose 2: fatigue (100% vs 60%), headache (100% vs. 80%, respectively), myalgia (100% vs. 40%), 
nausea (60% vs. 0%) and pyrexia (60% vs. 20%). 
5.3.2.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was similar after the 1st (40%) and the 2nd dose (50%) of 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (all grade 1). The frequency of unsolicited AEs considered 
related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (20%) compared to the 2nd dose (0%). There 
were no fatal AE, but 1 SAE post-dose 1 (Nephrolithiasis - not related to vaccine). 
In group 3, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was higher after the 1st (80%) (all grade 2) compared to 
the 2nd dose (20%) (grade 1) of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (60%) compared 
to the 2nd dose (0%). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
In group 1, no unsolicited AEs were reported twice (and only 1 injection site haemorrhage reported 
post-dose 1 was assessed as related to vaccine). In group 2, the most frequently reported unsolicited 
AE was chills with an highest frequency post-dose 1 (80%; all considered related to vaccine) compared 
to post-dose 2 (none). 
5.3.2.3.  Cohort 2a (Adults Aged ≥18 to ≤55 Years) 
Group 2 data (D1 vaccination and booster dose at 6 month with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest, 
however the number of subjects is limited (N=29 1st dose, N=19 2nd dose). The other groups are of 
less interest for the purpose of this variation. 
5.3.2.3.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most of the 136 participants were white (83.8%), 51.5% were female and 48.5% were male. The 
median age was 37 years (range: 19-55 years) and the median BMI was 24.4 kg/m2 (range: 17-30 
kg/m2). These characteristics were similar in each group. The small number of SARS-CoV-2 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

seropositive participants at baseline (2 participants in group 2 and 5 in groups 1, 3 and 4) precluded 
any meaningful conclusion to be drawn for this subgroup. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was similar in group 2 (41.4%) 
and groups 1, 3 and 4 (47.8%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) (mainly paracetamol and ibuprofen). 
In group 5 (placebo), the intake was of 29.4%. 
In group 2 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp), the intake of concomitant medication was highest post-
dose 1 (41.4%) compared to post-dose 2 (26.3%). 
5.3.2.3.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 2, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher after the 1st (93.1%) compared to the booster 
dose (78.9%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (6 months apart) (1 headache AE ≥ grade 3 post-dose 1). 
The frequency of solicited local AEs was similar after the 1st dose (82.8%) and the booster dose 
(78.9%). The frequency of solicited systemic AEs was higher after the 1st dose (79.3%) compared to 
the booster dose (57.9%). All solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the study 
vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In group 2, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a frequency 
similar post-dose 1 (79.3%) and post-booster dose (78.9%) (grade 1 and 2). 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 2, all solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared to post-
booster dose: fatigue (58.6% vs 26.3%), headache (55.2% vs. 47.4%, respectively), myalgia (58.6% 
vs. 21.1%), nausea (27.6% vs. 10.5%) and pyrexia (10.3% vs. 0%). 
5.3.2.3.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 2, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was higher after the 1st (17.2%) compared to the booster 
dose (10.5%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (6 months apart) (grade 1 and 2). The frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was similar after the 1st dose (6.9%) and the 
booster dose (5.3%). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
Only fatigue was reported with a frequency of at least 10% in any group (11.8% in group 5, post-dose 
1 and post-booster dose (after placebo each). Fatigue was not reported in group 2. 
In group 2, post-dose 1, the only unsolicited AE related to vaccination was pyrexia (6.9%). Post-
booster dose, 2 unsolicited AE related to vaccination were reported in 1 subject: presyncope and 
abdominal pain (5.3% each).

5.3.2.4.  Cohort 2b (Adults Aged 18 to 55 Years) 
The following group are of main interest: group 2 (D1, D57 vaccination, and booster dose at 8 months 
with 5.1010 vp) (N=30 1st dose, N=29 2nd dose), and groups 1, 3, and 4 (D1 and D57 vaccination with 
5.1010 vp, and placebo booster dose at 8 months) (N=90 1st dose, N=83 2nd dose). The last group 5 is 
of less interest for the purpose of this variation. However, only post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 data are 
relevant. 
5.3.2.4.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most of the 135 participants were white (86.7%), 43% were female and 57% were male. The median 
age was 37 years (range: 19-55 years) and the median BMI was 24.5 kg/m2 (range: 18-30 kg/m2). 
These characteristics were similar in each group. However, in group 5 (placebo), there were 66.7% 
females and 33.3% males. The small number of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants at baseline (1 
participant in group 2 and 2 in groups 1, 3 and 4) precluded any meaningful conclusion to be drawn for 
this subgroup. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was similar in group 2 (40%) and 
groups 1, 3 and 4 (45.6%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) (mainly paracetamol and ibuprofen). In 
group 5 (placebo), the intake was of 20%. 
In group 2 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp), the intake of concomitant medication was similar post-
dose 1 (20%) compared to post-dose 2 (20.7%). However, in groups 1, 3 and 4 (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp), the intake of concomitant medication was highest post-dose 1 (45.6%) compared to post-
dose 2 (32.5%). 
5.3.2.4.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 2, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher after the 1st (83.3%) compared to 2nd dose 
(75.9%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (3 subjects with AEs ≥ grade 3 post-dose 1, and 
3 subjects with AEs ≥ grade 3 post-dose 2 – mainly systemic). The frequency of solicited local AEs was 
similar after the 1st dose (76.7%) and the 2nd dose (72.4%). The frequency of solicited systemic AEs 
was higher after the 1st dose (76.7%) compared to the booster dose (58.6%). 
In groups 1, 3 and 4, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher after the 1st (91.1%) compared to 2nd 
dose (83.1%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (11 subjects with AEs ≥ grade 3 post-dose 
1, and 3 subjects with AEs ≥ grade 3 post-dose 2 – mainly systemic). The frequency of solicited local 
AEs was similar after the 1st dose (77.8%) and the 2nd dose (72.3%). The frequency of solicited 
systemic AEs was higher after the 1st dose (78.9%) compared to the 2nd dose (66.3%). 
Type II variation assessment report

In all these groups, all solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the study vaccine 
as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In group 2, and in groups 1, 3 and 4, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination 
site pain, with a frequency similar post-dose 1 (76.7% and 76.7%, respectively) and post-dose 2 
(72.4% and 72.3%, respectively) (grade 1 and 2). A trend towards a decrease in the frequency and 
severity of solicited local AEs with increasing age of participants was observed in all active vaccine 
groups post any Ad26.COV2.S administration (18-30 year-of-age vs. 31-45 vs. 46-55). 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 2, all solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared to post-
dose 2: fatigue (50% vs 37.9%), headache (60% vs. 41.4%), myalgia (56.7% vs. 34.5%), nausea 
(16.7% vs. 17.2%) and pyrexia (10% vs. 3.4%). 
In groups 1, 3 and 4, all solicited systemic AEs were reported more frequently post-dose 1 compared 
to post-dose 2: fatigue (64.4% vs 47%), headache (63.3% vs. 49.4%, respectively), myalgia (46.7% 
vs. 41%), nausea (24.4% vs. 18.1%) and pyrexia (22.2% vs. 8.4%). 
5.3.2.4.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 2, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was higher after the 1st (20%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(10.3%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (mainly grade 1 and 2). The frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (10%) compared 
to the 2nd dose (3.4%). There were fatal AE but 1 SAE considered as not related to the vaccine 
(anaphylactic shock and uterine prolapse). 
In groups 1, 3 and 4, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was similar after the 1st (17.8%) and the 2nd 
dose (13.3%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (mainly grade 1 and 2). The frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (14.4%) 
compared to the 2nd dose (6%). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were chills (6.7% in group 2 and 4.4% in groups 1, 3 and 
4). All those were reported post-dose 1 and assessed as related to the vaccine. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs assessed as related to vaccine were: 
-  Group 2 post-dose 1: chills (6.7%), abnormal dreams (3.3%), decreased appetite (3.3%) 
-  Group 2 post-dose 2: feeling cold (3.4%) 
-  Groups 1, 3 and 4 post-dose 1: chills (4.4%) and fatigue (2.2%),  
-  Groups 1, 3 and 4 post-dose 2: fatigue (2.4%)

5.3.2.5.  Cohort 3 (Adults Aged ≥65 Years) 
Cohort 3 (groups 1 and 3) had a 2-month interval planned per protocol; however, due to a study 
pause all 157 participants except 3 sentinel participants per group received their 2nd dose after 3 
months. 
Group 1 data (D1 and D85 vaccination with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest (N=81 1st dose, N=77 2nd 
dose). Group 3 data (D1 and D85 vaccination with 1.1011 vp) are supportive (N=82 1st dose, N=80 2nd 
dose). The other groups are of less interest for the purpose of this variation. 
5.3.2.5.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most of the 403 participants were white (98.3%), 49.9% were female and 50.1% were male. The 
median age was 69 years (range: 65-88 years) and the median BMI was 25.7 kg/m2 (range: 17-30 
kg/m2). These characteristics were similar in each group. The small number of SARS-CoV-2 
seropositive participants at baseline (2 participants in group 1 and 3 in group 3) precluded any 
meaningful conclusion to be drawn for this subgroup. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in groups 1 (22.2%) 
and 2 (12.5%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to groups 3 (31.7%) and 4 (27.8%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp); difference mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol and ibuprofen. In 
group 5 (placebo), the intake was only of 8.6%. 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was also lower in group 1 
(18.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 3 (26.3%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 
vp). 
The intake of concomitant medication was slightly highest post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 for the 
2 tested doses. 
5.3.2.5.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (63%) and the 2nd dose (67.5%) of 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local AEs were slightly lower 
after the 1st dose (46.9%) compared to the 2nd (53.2%). The frequencies of solicited systemic AEs 
were slightly higher after the 1st dose (48.1%) and the 2nd (42.9%). There were only 1 solicited 
(systemic) AEs ≥ grade 3 (post-dose 2). 
In group 3, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (70.7%) and the 2nd dose (73.8%) 
of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local AEs were lower after the 
1st dose (40.2%) compared to the 2nd (63.8%). The frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were similar

after the 1st dose (57.3%) and the 2nd (50%). There were only 2 solicited (systemic) AEs ≥ grade 3 
post-dose 1, and 1 solicited (systemic) AEs ≥ grade 3 post-dose 2. 
In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the 
study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In groups 1 and 3, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a 
frequency lower post-dose 1 (46.9% and 39%, respectively) compared to post-dose 2 (53.2% and 
63.8%, respectively) (mainly grade 1 and 2). 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 1, all solicited systemic AEs were reported with similar frequency post-dose 1 compared to 
post-dose 2: fatigue (32.1% vs 29.9%), headache (28.4% vs. 26%), myalgia (21% vs. 22.1%), 
nausea (4.9% vs. 1.3%) and pyrexia (4.9% vs. 1.3%). 
In group 3, all solicited systemic AEs were reported with similar frequency post-dose 1 compared to 
post-dose 2: fatigue (36.6% vs 36.3%), headache (37.8% vs. 33.8%), myalgia (26.8% vs. 21.3%), 
nausea (8.5% vs. 5%) and pyrexia (7.3% vs. 2.5%). 
5.3.2.5.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was slightly higher after the 1st (19.8%) compared to the 
2nd dose (14.3%) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (3 months apart). The frequency of unsolicited AEs ≥ 
grade 3 was higher after the 1st dose (3.7%) compared to the 2nd dose (1.3%). The frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was higher after the 1st dose (6.2%) compared 
to the 2nd dose (0%). There were no fatal AE, but 2 subjects with SAEs not considered as related to 
vaccine (atrial fibrillation; hip fracture). 
In group 3, the frequency of unsolicited AEs was higher after the 1st (23.2%) compared to the 2nd dose

5.3.2.6.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
In the groups of interest (in each cohorts), there were no AE leading to permanent stop of vaccination. 
Upon request more details about AE leading to discontinuation have been provided as detailed below: 
- 
Two AEs in cohort 1a group 4 (1.1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S, placebo, 2 months apart): Grade 1 non-
serious AE of COVID-19 9 days post-dose 1 (Ad26.COV2.S 1x1011 vp) considered not related to the 
study vaccine; SAE of Grade 3 pyrexia on day of 1st vaccination (Ad26.COV2.S 1x1011 vp) 
considered related to the study vaccine. 
-  One AE in cohort 1b group 1 (5.1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S, 5.1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S, 2 months apart):

5.4.  Study COV1002  
5.4.1.  Methods 
This is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study in adults aged 20 to 55 
years and 65 years and older in Japan. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S are being evaluated at 2 dose levels, administered IM as a 2-dose schedule. The study 
included the following cohorts: 
-  Cohort 1: 125 participants, aged 20 to 55 years, were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to each dose 
vaccine group or placebo. 
-  Cohort 2: 125 participants, aged 65 years or older, were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to each dose 
vaccine group or placebo. 
The study duration from screening until the last follow-up visit is approximately 13 months per 
participant. The study consisted of a screening period of up to 28 days, vaccinations on Days 1 and 57, 
and follow-up visits up to 1 year after the first vaccination. 
An interim CSR has been submitted (data cutoff: 28 December 2020 (Cohort 1 Day 85) and 22 
February 2021 (Cohort 2 Day 85)). 
An interim safety update report has been also submitted.This report provides updated safety data 
including unsolicited AEs, deaths, other SAEs and other significant AEs, and narratives for Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 based on snapshot data dated 02 August 2021. 
After the 1st dose, the median follow-up is 116 days for cohort 1 (data cutoff: 28 December 2020) and 
138 days for cohort 2 (data cutoff: 22 February 2021)). After the 2nd dose at D57, the median follow-
up is 59 days for cohort 1 and 81 days for cohort 2.  
5.4.2.  Results 
5.4.2.1.  Cohort 1 (Adults Aged 20 to 55 Years) 
Group 1 data (D1 and D57 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest (N=51 1st dose, N=43 2nd 
dose). Group 2 data (D1 and D57 vaccination with 1.1011 vp) are supportive (N=50 1st dose, N=31 2nd 
dose). The last group is of less interest for the purpose of this variation.

5.4.2.1.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The study was conducted in Japan. Overall, 56.8% of participants were women and 43.2% were men. 
The median age was 42.0 years (range: 20-55 years), and more than half of the participants (55.2%) 
were in the age category of 41 to 55 years. The median BMI was 21.8 kg/m2 (range: 15.3-32.5 
kg/m2). Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among the vaccine groups. 
However, in group 3 (placebo), there were 41.7% females and 58.3% males. The small number of 
SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants at baseline (2 participants in group 2, and 0 participant each in 
groups 1 and 3) precluded any meaningful conclusion to be drawn for this subgroup. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in Group 1 (43.1%) 
(i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 2 (74%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp); 
difference mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol. In group 3 (placebo), the intake was null (table 
10 interim CSR). 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was also lower in group 1 
(32.6%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 2 (45.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 
vp). 
The intake of concomitant medication was highest post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 for the 2 
tested doses. 
5.4.2.1.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequencies of solicited AEs all grade and ≥ grade 3 (mainly systemic) were higher 
after the 1st (98% and 7.8%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (86% and 2.3%, respectively) of 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local AEs were similar after the 
1st dose (82.4%) and the 2nd (83.7%). The frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were higher after the 
1st dose (88.2%) compared to the 2nd (65.1%). 
In group 2, the frequencies of solicited AEs all grade and ≥ grade 3 (mainly systemic) were higher 
after the 1st (98% and 42%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (87.1% and 6.5%, respectively) 
of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs were 
higher after the 1st dose (86% and 96%, respectively) compared to the 2nd (77.4% and 74.2%, 
respectively). 
In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the 
study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In group 1, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a frequency 
similar post-dose 1 (82.4%) and post-dose 2 (83.7%) (mainly grade 1 and 2). In group 2, the most 
frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a frequency highest post-dose 1 
(86%) compared to post-dose 2 (77.4%) (mainly grade 1 and 2).  
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 1, all solicited systemic AEs were reported with highest frequency post-dose 1 compared to 
post-dose 2: fatigue (72.5% vs. 46.5%, respectively), headache (52.9% vs. 32.6%, respectively),

unsolicited AEs ≥ grade 3 considered related to the vaccine. The frequency of unsolicited AEs 
considered related to the study vaccine was highest after the 1st dose (36%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(12.9%). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
In group 1, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were: 
- 
- 
Post-dose 1: arthralgia (3.9%), diarrhoea (3.9%) and eczema (3.9%) 
Post-dose 2: diarrhoea (4.7%), administration site pruritus (4.7%), fatigue (4.7%) and headache

For both groups, no new unsolicited AEs (SAE or fatal AE) were reported after the data cut-off date of 
the interim CSR (28 December 2020) through the data cut-off of the interim safety update report (02 
August 2021). 
5.4.2.1.4.  Clinical laboratory evaluation 
The following laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs (Grade 1 in severity), in any vaccine 
groups: 
-  1/43 (2.3%) participants in the group 1, experienced an AE of C-reactive protein increased post-
dose 2, considered not related to the study vaccine. 
-  1/43 (2.3%) participants in the group 2, experienced an AE of C-reactive protein increased post-
dose 1 follow-up, considered not related to the study vaccine.

-  1/31 (3.2%) participants in the in the group 2 experienced an AE of alanine transferase increased 
post-dose 2, considered not related to the study vaccine. 
-  1/24 (4.2%) participants in the group 3 experienced an AE of C-reactive protein increased post-
dose 1, considered not related to the study vaccine. 
Examination of safety laboratory assessments at the different timepoints for all vaccination groups 
showed no notable differences compared with baseline values and/or with values from the placebo, 
placebo group. Overall, the percentages of participants with abnormal safety laboratory values 
(biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) were very low and no notable differences were 
noted between vaccine and placebo groups and vaccine dose levels. 
5.4.2.2.  Cohort 2 (Adults Aged 65 Years and older) 
Group 1 data (D1 and D57 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) are of main interest (N=50 1st dose, N=48 2nd 
dose). Group 2 data (D1 and D57 vaccination with 1.1011 vp) are supportive (N=50 1st dose, N=45 2nd 
dose). The last group is of less interest. 
5.4.2.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The study was conducted in Japan. Overall, 50.4% of participants were women and 49.6% were men. 
The median age was 70.0 years (range: 65-85 years), and 83.2% of the participants were in the age 
category of 65 to 75 years. The median BMI was 23.8 kg/m2 (range: 16.2-31.7 kg/m2). Demographics 
and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among the vaccine groups. However, in group 1, 
there were 44% females and 56% males. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in group 1 (8%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 2 (18.4%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp; difference 
mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol. In group 3 (placebo), the intake was of only 3.8%. 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was also lower in group 1 (2.1%) 
(i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp) compared to group 2 (4.4%) (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp). 
The intake of concomitant medication was highest post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 for the 2 
tested doses. 
The small number of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants at baseline (0 participants in group 1, and 1 
participant each in groups 2 and 3) precluded any meaningful conclusion to be drawn for this 
subgroup. 
5.4.2.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (44%) and the 2nd dose (39.6%) of 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 97/151 
 
 
 
 
 
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs were 
slightly higher or similar after the 1st dose (36% and 26%, respectively) and the 2nd (28.9% and 
27.1%, respectively). There was only 1 ≥ grade 3 solicited (systemic) AE post-dose. 
In group 2, the frequency of solicited AEs was higher after the 1st (71.4%) compared to the 2nd dose 
(57.8%) of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). The frequencies of solicited local and systemic 
AEs were slightly higher or higher after the 1st dose (51% and 49%, respectively) compared to the 2nd 
(44.4% and 28.9%, respectively). There was only 1 ≥ grade 3 solicited (systemic) AE post-dose 1. 
In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the 
study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In groups 1 and 2, the most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a 
frequency similar or slightly higher post-dose 1 (36% and 46.9%, respectively) and post-dose 2 
(33.3% and 40%, respectively) (mainly grade 1). 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In group 1, most of the solicited systemic AEs were reported with highest frequency post-dose 1 
compared to post-dose 2: fatigue (22% vs. 10.4%, respectively), headache (16% vs. 4.2%, 
respectively), nausea (8% vs. 0%) and pyrexia (4% vs. 0%). Only myalgia was reported with lowest 
frequency post-dose 1 (14%) compared to post-dose 2 (22.9%). 
In group 2, all solicited systemic AEs were reported with highest frequency post-dose 1 compared to 
post-dose 2: fatigue (34.7% vs. 17.8%, respectively), headache (24.5% vs. 8.9%, respectively), 
myalgia (26.5% vs. 15.6%), nausea (6.1% vs. 2.2%) and pyrexia (10.2% vs. 0%). 
5.4.2.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In group 1, the frequencies of unsolicited AEs (all) and unsolicited AEs considered related to the 
vaccine were higher after the 1st (30% and 12%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (12.5% and 
4.2%, respectively) of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (mainly grade 1 and 2). There was 
only 1 ≥ grade 3 unsolicited AE post-dose 2 (intervertebral disc protrusion considered not related to 
the vaccine). There were no SAE or fatal AE. 
In group 2, the frequencies of unsolicited AEs (all) and unsolicited AEs considered related to the 
vaccine were higher after the 1st (24.5% and 6.1%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (11.1% 
and 0%, respectively) of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart) (mainly grade 1 and 2). There was 
only 1 ≥ grade 3 unsolicited AE post-dose 1 (considered not related to the vaccine). There were no 
fatal AE, but 1 SAE post-dose 1 considered not related to vaccine (grade 4 intervertebral disc 
protrusion). 
In group 1, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were: administration site pruritus (6%), 
osteoarthritis (4%), urticaria (4%) for post-dose 1; and administration site pruritus (4.2%) for post-
dose 2. The reported unsolicited AEs assessed as related to vaccine were: administration site pruritus 
for post-dose 1 and 2 (6% and 4.2%, respectively). 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 98/151 
 
 
 
In group 2, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were: rhinorrhoea (6.1%) for post-dose 1 (all 
events were reported only once post-dose 2). The reported unsolicited AEs assessed as related to 
vaccine were: musculoskeletal stiffness for post-dose 1 (4.1%). 
After the data cut-off date of the interim CSR (22 February 2021) through the data cut-off of the 
interim safety update report (02 August 2021), for both groups, no new unsolicited AEs were reported. 
However: 
-  An AE leading to death was reported in 1 participant in group 2: a 70-79 year old with medical 
history of bilateral cataracts, stomatitis, dyslipidemia, insomnia, hypertension, and constipation at 
study entry received the active vaccine in the 1×1011, 1×1011 vp group. Grade 4 acute myocardial 
infarction with fatal outcome was reported in the participant on Day 179. The event was 
considered not related to the study vaccine by the investigator. 
-  SAEs were reported in 3 participants in the 5×1010, 5×1010 vp group (schwannoma, atrial 
fibrillation, embolic stroke, and cataract ; atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke were reported in the 
same participant), 2 participants in the 1×1011, 1×1011 vp group (renal cancer and acute 
myocardial), and 1 participant in the placebo, placebo group (cystocele and uterine prolapse). 
None of the SAEs were considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator. 
5.4.2.2.4.  Clinical laboratory evaluation 
No laboratory abnormalities were reported as AEs. 
Examination of safety laboratory assessments at the different timepoints for all vaccination groups 
showed no notable differences compared with baseline values and/or with values from the placebo, 
placebo group. Overall, the percentages of participants with abnormal safety laboratory values 
(biochemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) were very low and no notable differences 
were noted between vaccine and placebo groups and vaccine dose levels. 
5.4.2.3.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
In cohort 1, there were no AE leading to permanent stop of vaccination.  
Three solicited AEs resulted in study vaccine discontinuation during post-dose 1 in group 2 (1×1011, 
1×1011 vp group), which were all fever/pyrexia, and no solicited AE resulted in study vaccine 
discontinuation during post-dose 2. 
No unsolicited AE resulted in study vaccine discontinuation during post-dose 1 and post-dose 2, and 1 
AE resulted in study vaccine discontinuation during the post-dose 1 follow-up phase in group 2 (blood 
pressure increased not related to the study vaccine on D98). 
In cohort 2, there were no AE leading to permanent stop of vaccination. No unsolicited AE resulted in 
study vaccine discontinuation during post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 in groups 1 and 2. 
One participant in the placebo, placebo group reported AEs of blood pressure increased (Grade 3; not 
resolved) and dizziness postural (Grade 1; resolved) during post-dose 1 follow-up (after the 28-day 
postvaccination), which resulted in study vaccine discontinuation. Both events were considered not 
related to the study vaccine by the investigator. 
In cohorts 1 and 2, no new AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation were reported after the data 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 99/151 
 
 
 
cut-off date of the interim CSR (28 December 2020 or 22 February 2021, respectively) through the 
data cut-off of the interim safety update report (02 August 2021). 
5.4.2.4.  AESIs 
No AESIs were reported for Cohort 1 up to the cut-off date of 28 December 2020, and for Cohort 2 up 
to the cut-off date of 22 February 2021.  
For both groups in cohort 1, no suspected AESIs were reported after the data cut-off date of the 
interim CSR (28 December 2020) through the data cut-off of the interim safety update report (02 
August 2021). 
In cohort 2 however, after the data cut-off date of the interim CSR (22 February 2021) through the 
data cut-off of the interim safety update report (02 August 2021), AESIs were reported in 1 participant 
in the 5×1010, 5×1010 vp group and 2 participants in the 1×1011, 1×1011 vp group: 
-  On Day 161, a Grade 4 AE of embolic stroke was reported during the post-dose 2 follow-up phase 
in the 5×1010, 5×1010 vp group. The platelet count results of the participant are 26.3×104/μL 
before vaccination, 26.5×104/μL on the day of the first vaccination, 23.5×104/μL on the day of the 
second vaccination, and 24.5×104/μL on the day of the event onset. The event was not a TTS. The 
event resolved 8 days after onset. The event was considered not related to the study vaccine by 
the investigator.  
-  On Day 57, a Grade 2 AE of thrombocytopenia was reported during the post-dose 1 follow-up 
phase in the 1×1011, 1×1011 vp group. The platelet count results of the participant are 
13.7×104/μL before vaccination, 14.7×104/μL on the day of the first vaccination, 10.2×104/μL on 
the day of the event onset. The event was not considered a TTS. The event resolved 175 days 
after onset. The event was considered not related to the study vaccine by the investigator. 
-  A 70-79 year-old participant: On Day 179, a Grade 4 AE of acute myocardial infarction was 
reported during the post-dose 2 follow-up phase in the 1×1011, 1×1011 vp group (123 days after 
the booster dose (second dose)). The platelet count results of the participant are 16.4×104/μL 
before vaccination, 15.2×104/μL on the day of the first vaccination, 14.2×104/μL on the day of the 
second vaccination, and 11.9×104/μL on the day of the event onset. AntiPF4 testing was 
performed during the study at sample collection timepoints pre and post vaccination, results are 
considered negative (0.126 (study day 1), 0.127 (study day 15), 0.136 (study day 29), 0.16 
(study day 57), 0.121 (study day 71), 0.139 (study day 80)). Anti PF4 testing was not performed 
at the time of the event. The event was assessed as a TTS, Brighton Collaboration level 3 
(Brighton Collaboration 2021), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria “none 
Tier-1” (Shimabukuro 2021). This event resulted in death. The event was considered not related to 
the study vaccine by the investigator (in particular because of the too long time-to-onset). 
5.5.  Study COV2001 
5.5.1.  Methods 
This is an is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 2a study in 
healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, adults in good or stable health aged 65 years and older, 
and in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years inclusive. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
Ad26.COV2.S are being evaluated at several dose levels, as a 2-dose or a single-dose schedule. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 100/151 
 
 
 
Topline (TLR) results have been submitted (data cutoff: 11 May 2021). Adolescents are out of scope of 
this assessment and will not be discussed in this report. 
After the 1st dose, the median follow-up is 232 days for all groups. After the 2nd dose at D57 (groups 1, 
7, 2, 3, 6 and 8), the median follow-up is 174 days. After the 2nd dose at D84 (groups 9 and 10), the 
median follow-up is 144 days. After the 2nd dose 6 months after dose 1 (groups 4 and 5), the median 
follow-up is 61 days. 
5.5.2.  Results 
Groups 7 and 8 had a 1-month interval planned per protocol; however, due to a study pause 
participants received their booster dose (second dose) at 2 months. 
The following groups are of main interest: 
- 
- 
groups 1+7 data: D1 and D57 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp (N=141 1st dose, N=137 2nd dose) 
group 9 data: D1 and D85 vaccinations with 5.1010 vp (N=53 1st dose, N=51 2nd dose) 
The following data are supportive:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
group 2: D1 and D57 vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp (N=81 1st dose, N=73 2nd dose) 
group 3: D1 and D57 vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp (N=75 1st dose, N=74 2nd dose) 
group 5: D1 vaccination with 5.1010 vp (N=81); D57 placebo (N=77); 4 months post-dose 2 with 
1.25.1010 vp (i.e. 6 months post-dose 1) (N=74) 
group 4: D1 vaccination with 1.1011 vp (N=74); D57 placebo (N=72); 4 months post-dose 2 with 
1.25.1010 vp (i.e. 6 months post-dose 1) (N=68). 
The last groups are of less interest for the purpose of this variation. The 3rd dose data (1.25.1010 vp) 4 
months post-dose 2 will not be assessed in this report. 
5.5.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Most participants were white (96.9%). Overall, 36.8% of participants were female and 63.2% were 
male. The median age was 49.0 years (range: 18-84 years); 35.6% of participants were between 18 
and 40 years old, 28.5% were between 41 and 55 years old, 31.3% were between 65 and 75 years 
old, and 4.6% were older than 75. The median body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 kg/m2 (range: 16.8-
30.0 kg/m2). Demographics, other than gender, and baseline characteristics in adults were generally 
well balanced between the different groups. However, in group 10 (placebo), there were 52% females 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 101/151 
 
 
 
 
 
and 48% males. The distribution of participants across sites was well balanced between the different 
groups. 
Post-dose 1, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in group 3 (8%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (16%) (i.e. vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp 
– 2 months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (27%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart), group 9 
(28.3%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), group 5 (24.7%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart) and group 4 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 
1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart); difference mainly driven by the intake of paracetamol. In the placebo 
groups, the intake was 3.8% in groups 6 + 8 (placebo – 2 months apart) and 12% in group 10 
(placebo – 3 months apart). 
Post-dose 2, the intake of concomitant medication of special interest was lower in group 3 (6.8%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (17.8%) (i.e. vaccinations with 2.5.1010 
vp – 2 months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (24.8%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and 
group 9 (23.5%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 3 months apart); difference mainly driven by the 
intake of paracetamol. In the placebo groups, the intake was 6.1% in groups 6 + 8 (placebo – 2 
months apart) and 12% in group 10 (placebo – 3 months apart). 
Overall, the intake of concomitant medication was similar post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 for the 
3 tested doses (2 or 3 months apart). 
However, in group 5 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart) and in group 
4 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), the intake of concomitant 
medication of special interest was higher post-dose 1 (24.7% and 44.6%, respectively) compared to 
post-antigen presentation at 6 months (14.9% and 10.3%). 
The number of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants at baseline per group was not provided. However, 
it is doubtful that the number would be high enough to have meaningful conclusions. 
5.5.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
In groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), the frequency of solicited AEs was similar after the 1st (66% and 62.3%, 
respectively) and the 2nd dose (69.3% and 62.7%, respectively). The frequencies of solicited local AEs 
were slightly higher or similar after the 1st dose (53.2% and 39.6%, respectively) and the 2nd (46% 
and 39.2%, respectively). The frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were similar or higher after the 1st 
dose (59.6% and 60.4%, respectively) and the 2nd (59.1% and 51%, respectively). The frequencies of 
≥ grade 3 solicited AEs (mainly systemic) were higher or similar after the 1st dose (3.5% and 5.7%, 
respectively) and the 2nd (2.2% and 3.9%, respectively). 
In group 5 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart) and group 4 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), the frequency of solicited AEs was 
higher after the 1st (67.9% and 77%, respectively) compared to the post-antigen presentation (54.1% 
and 54.4%). The frequency of solicited local AEs was slightly higher or similar after the 1st dose 
(51.9% and 52.7%) and the post-antigen presentation (47.3% and 45.6%). The frequencies of 
solicited systemic AEs were higher after the 1st dose (61.7% and 75.7%) compared to the post-antigen 
presentation (37.8% and 33.8%). 
Overall, a trend towards an increase in the frequency solicited AEs (local and systemic) was observed 
with increasing vaccine doses:

- 
Post-dose 1, frequency of all solicited AEs, solicited local AEs, and solicited systemic AEs, was 
lower or similar in group 3 (53.3%, 32%, and 41.3%, respectively) (i.e. vaccinations with 
1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (53.1%, 33.3% and 43.2%, respectively) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (66%, 53.2% and 59.6%, 
respectively) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart). 
- 
Post-dose 2, frequency of all solicited AEs, solicited local AEs, and solicited systemic AEs, was 
lower or similar in group 3 (52.7%, 39.2%, and 33.8%, respectively) (i.e. vaccinations with 
1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (61.6%, 45.2% and 43.8%, respectively) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (69.3%, 46% and 59.1%, 
respectively) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart). 
In all groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the study 
vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Solicited local AEs 
In groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), the frequency of the most frequently reported solicited local AE 
(vaccination site pain) was higher or similar after the 1st dose (53.2% and 39.6%, respectively) and 
the 2nd (46% and 39.2%, respectively). 
In group 5 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart) and in group 4 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), the frequency of the most frequently 
reported solicited local AE (vaccination site pain) was similar after the 1st dose (51.9% and 52.7%, 
respectively) and the post-antigen presentation (47.3% and 45.6%). 
Overall, a trend towards an increase in the frequency of the most frequently reported solicited local AE 
was observed with increasing vaccine doses: 
- 
- 
Post-dose 1, frequency of vaccination site pain was lower or similar in group 3 (32%) (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (33.3%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
2.5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (53.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months 
apart). 
Post-dose 2, frequency of vaccination site pain was lower in group 3 (39.2%) (i.e. vaccinations 
with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) vs. group 2 (43.8%) (i.e. vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 
months apart) vs. groups 1+7 (46%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart). 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart), all solicited systemic AEs were 
reported with highest or similar frequency post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2: fatigue (45.4% vs. 
45.3%, respectively), headache (41.1% vs. 36.5%), myalgia (34% vs. 27%), nausea (9.2% vs. 7.3%) 
and pyrexia (9.9% vs. 3.6%). 
Overall, a trend towards an increase in the frequency of the all reported solicited systemic AEs was 
observed with increasing vaccine doses: 
- 
Post-dose 1, in group 3 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart), group 2 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and groups 1+7 (53.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 2 months apart), the frequencies were: fatigue (28% vs. 28.4% vs. 45.4%,

respectively), headache (25.3% vs. 27.2% vs. 41.1%), myalgia (9.3% vs. 11.1% vs. 34%), 
- 
nausea (4% vs. 4.9% vs. 9.2%) and pyrexia (0% vs. 6.2% vs. 9.9%). 
Post-dose 2, in group 3 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart), group 2 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and groups 1+7 (53.2%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 2 months apart), the frequencies were: fatigue (21.6% vs. 20.5% vs. 45.3%, 
respectively), headache (20.3% vs. 32.9% vs. 36.5%), myalgia (6.8% vs. 15.1% vs. 27%), 
nausea (2.7% vs. 9.6% vs. 7.3%) and pyrexia (0% vs. 0% vs. 3.6%). 
In group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), all solicited systemic AEs were reported 
with highest or similar frequency post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2: fatigue (45.3% vs. 45.1%, 
respectively), headache (39.6% vs. 27.5%), myalgia (35.8% vs. 21.6%), nausea (9.4% vs. 5.9%) 
and pyrexia (7.5% vs. 5.9%). 
In group 5 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), all solicited systemic 
AEs were reported with highest frequency post-dose 1 compared to the post-antigen presentation: 
fatigue (45.7% vs. 28.4%, respectively), headache (40.7% vs. 24.3%), myalgia (38.3% vs. 14.9%), 
nausea (11.1% vs. 9.5%) and pyrexia (17.3% vs. 0%).  
In group 4 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), all solicited systemic 
AEs were reported with highest frequency post-dose 1 compared to the post-antigen presentation: 
fatigue (51.4% vs. 22.1%, respectively), headache (60.8% vs. 17.6%), myalgia (37.8% vs. 13.2%), 
nausea (20.3% vs. 4.4%) and pyrexia (20.3% vs. 0%).  
Solicited AEs by age categories 
When comparing the number of participants with solicited AEs post-dose 1 by age category, a trend 
towards a decrease in the frequency and severity of solicited local AEs with increasing age of 
participants was observed in all active vaccine groups Ad26.COV2.S administration (1.25.1010 vp, 
2.5.1010 vp, 5.1010 vp or 1.1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S). 
Moreover, for all age categories, a trend toward an increase in the frequencies of solicited local and 
systemic AEs were observed with increasing dose of vaccine. 
5.5.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), the frequency of unsolicited AEs was overall similar after the 1st (28.4% 
and 15.1%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (24.8% and 19.6%, respectively) (mainly grade 1 
or 2). The frequencies of unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccine were overall similar after 
the 1st dose (5.7% and 1.9%, respectively) and the 2nd (8% and 2%, respectively). The frequencies of 
≥ grade 3 unsolicited AEs were higher after the 1st dose (2.1% and 1.9%, respectively) and the 2nd 
(0% and 0%, respectively). 
In groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 
5.1010 vp – 3 months apart), the frequency of unsolicited AEs was overall higher or similar during the 
post-dose 1 follow-up (7.1% and 17%, respectively) and during the post-dose 2 follow-up (7.4% and 
3.9%, respectively) (mainly grade 1 or 2). The frequencies of unsolicited AEs considered related to the 
vaccine were overall similar during the post-dose 1 follow-up (2.1% and 0%, respectively) and during 
the post-dose 2 follow-up (0.7% and 0%, respectively).

There were no fatal AE, but, post-dose 2 follow-up, there were 1 SAE in groups 1+7 (i.e. vaccinations 
with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart) and 1 SAE in group 9 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 3 months 
apart) (none considered related to vaccine). 
In group 5 (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), the frequencies of 
unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccine were higher after the 1st (37% 
and 8.6%, respectively) compared to the post-antigen presentation (14.9% and 5.4%) (no ≥ grade 3 
unsolicited AEs). 
In group 4 (i.e. vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart), the frequencies of 
unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccine were higher after the 1st (44.6% 
and 13.5%, respectively) compared to the post-antigen presentation (7.4% and 4.4%) (no ≥ grade 3 
unsolicited AEs). 
The only fatal AE was reported in group 2 (D1 and D57 vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp) (unknown cause 
considered as unrelated to study vaccine). 
Post-dose 1, frequency of unsolicited AEs was lower in group 3 (18.7%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) compared to group 2 (32.1%) (i.e. vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 
months apart) which was similar to groups 1+7 (28.4%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months 
apart). Post-dose 2, frequency of unsolicited AEs was similar in group 3 (20.3%) (i.e. vaccinations with 
1.25.1010 vp – 2 months apart) compared to group 2 (24.7%) (i.e. vaccinations with 2.5.1010 vp – 2 
months apart) and groups 1+7 (24.8%) (i.e. vaccinations with 5.1010 vp – 2 months apart). 
Only headache was reported with a frequency of at least 10% in any group (11.1% in group 2, post-
dose 1 after 2.5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S). Post-dose 1, headache was reported with a frequency of 4% 
in group 3 (1.25x1010 vp), 5% in groups 1+7 (5x1010 vp), 12.3% in group 5 (5x1010 vp) and 6.8% in 
group 4 (1x1011 vp). Headache was also reported post-dose 2 in group 9 (5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp 3 
months apart) with a frequency of 3.9%. 
Post-dose 1, there was no unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 3 (1.25x1010 vp), 11.1% 
unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 2 (2.5x1010 vp; chills being the more frequent), 5.7%

to vaccination in group 5 (5x1010 vp; chills being the more frequent), and ), and 13.5% unsolicited AE 
related to vaccination in group 4 (1x1011 vp; chills being the more frequent). 
Post-dose 2, there were 5.4% unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 3 (1.25x1010 vp, 
1.25x1010 vp 2 months apart; all AEs reported only once), 5.5% unsolicited AE related to vaccination 
in group 2 (2.5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp 2 months apart; all AEs reported only once), 8% unsolicited AE 
related to vaccination in groups 1+7 (5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp 2 months apart; only fatigue being twice), 
and 2% unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 9 (5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp 3 months apart; only 
oral herpes). 
Post-antigen presentation, there were 5.4% unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 5 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 5.1010 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart); chills being the more frequent (2.5%). 
Post-antigen presentation, there were 4.4% unsolicited AE related to vaccination in group 4 (i.e. 
vaccinations with 1.1011 vp and 1.25.1010 vp – 6 months apart); injection site pain, headache,

Not provided 
5.5.2.5.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
Upon request more details about AE leading to discontinuation have been provided: no participants 
discontinued the study due to an AE. Three participants discontinued the vaccine treatment due to an 
AE: 
-  One participant in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp, placebo group due to a grade 4 lung 
adenocarcinoma (SAE) deemed not related to the vaccine 15 days after the placebo dose.  
-  A second participant in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp, Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group had a grade 3 
acute myeloid leukaemia (SAE) deemed not related to the vaccine 63 days after the booster dose 
(second dose).  
-  A third participant in the Ad26.COV2.S 2.5x1010 vp group experienced a grade 1 paraesthesia 
(transient paresthesias in both hands and face) deemed related to the vaccine 37 days after the 
first dose. 
5.5.2.6.  AESIs 
Two thrombotic events have been reported. One participant in the 5×1010 vp, PL (56-day) group had 
Grade 2 thrombophlebitis at Day 2 (ie, one day after the first vaccination) and 1 participant in the 
5×1010, 5×1010 vp (56-day) group had Grade 3 ischemic stroke 8 days post antigen presentation 
(after a 3rd dose 1.25.1010 vp 4 months post-dose 2) (no platelet count data available). 
5.6.  Study COV2008  
5.6.1.  Methods 
The study COV2008 is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) 
administered as booster vaccination in adults 18 years of age or older at least 6 months after receiving 
a primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (1-dose in study COV3001, N=770) or Pfizer’s BNT162b2 (2-
dose, N=770). 
The study included the following cohorts: 
-  Cohort 1: 370 participants (including 7-day reactogenicity data from 244 participants), who have 
received an Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) at least 6 months after 
primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) vaccination.  
-  Cohort 2: Dose level-blinded reactogenicity data are also available from 161 participants (including 
7-day reactogenicity data from 76 participants) who have received an Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×
1010 vp, 2.5×1010 vp, or 1×1010 vp) ≥6 months after primary (2-dose) administration of Pfizer’s 
BNT162b2. 
Data entry and collection were still ongoing at the time of the data extraction for this study (7 
September 2021). Not all participants had completed the 28-day post-vaccination reporting period at 
Type II variation assessment report

the time of the data extraction. Therefore, these outputs represent an incomplete snapshot. Standard 
data cleaning and reconciliation activities had also not been performed on these data, implying that 
data are subject to change in further analyses. 
The median duration of the follow-up is unknown at this stage. 
Dose level-blinded reactogenicity have been provided after the booster vaccination for both cohorts. 
5.6.2.  Results 
5.6.2.1.  Cohort 1 
5.6.2.1.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
There were 370 participants (aged ≥18 years) who received primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S 
followed by an Ad26.COV2.S booster (5×1010 or 2.5×1010 or 1×1010 vp) ≥6 months later, 244 for 
whom 7-day reactogenicity data are available. Of these 244 participants, 123 (50.4%) were female, 
121 (49.6%) were male, and 220 (90.2%) were white. The median age was 57.0 years (range: 22.0-

5.7.  Study COV3001 
5.7.1.  Methods 
VAC31518COV3001 is ongoing multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3, 
pivotal efficacy and safety study that is evaluating efficacy and safety of Ad26.COV2.S for the 
prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. The planned total 
sample size was up to approximately 40,000 participants. 
Participants were randomized in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S or placebo at 
Day 1 as shown in Table below. The study vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection in the 
deltoid muscle. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5×1010 vp. 
Table 17: Vaccination Schedule VAC31518COV3001 
The study consists of a screening phase of up to 28 days, a 52-week study period, and a long-term 
follow-up period of 1 additional year. The end-of-study is considered as the completion of the last visit 
for the last participant in the study. 
A total of 43,788 participants were vaccinated (21,898 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 21,890 in the 
placebo-group - FAS). The median follow-up in the FAS was 123.0 days (double-blind). At the time of 
the final analysis of the double-blind phase, 11,290 (25.8%) participants in the FAS had at least 6 
months (defined as 24 weeks) of double-blind follow-up. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 108/151 
 
 
 
 
This final analysis of the double-blind phase of the study includes data from the Safety Subset (ie, a 
subset of the FAS) for the analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs (3,356 participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 group and 3380 in the placebo-group) and data from the FAS for the analysis of 
MAAEs, deaths, other SAEs and AEs leading to study/vaccine discontinuation. 
Final analysis topline (TLR) results have been submitted (data cutoff: 9 July 2021). 
5.7.2.  Results 
5.7.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
No relevant differences in demographics and baseline characteristics were observed between the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and the placebo-group. 
Overall in the FAS, 58.7% of participants were white and 19.4% were black or African American. 
Subjects were coming from Latin America (40.9%), Northern America (44.1%), and Southern Africa 
(15%) (none from Europe). 54.9% of participants were male. The median age was 52 years (range: 
18; 100 years) and 33.5% of participants were ≥60 years of age. The median BMI was 27.91 kg/m2 
(range: 11.9-82.6 kg/m2). 42% of subjects had at least 1 comorbidity at baseline; The main 
comorbidity being obesity (28.7% of subjects). There were 2,253 participants with positive SARS-CoV-
2-serostatus and/or PCR status at baseline in the 5.1010 vp group and 2,208 in the placebo group. 
In the safety subset, there were 166 participants with positive SARS-CoV-2-serostatus and/or PCR 
status at baseline in the 5.1010 vp group and 162 in the placebo group.The demographic characteristics 
have not been provided for the safety subset.  
The intake of concomitant medication has not been provided for the FAS and the safety subset. 
5.7.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
As expected, the frequencies for local and systemic solicited AEs were higher in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group (54.8% and 60.2%, respectively) compared to the placebo-group (20.2% and 38.7%). In both 
groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the use of the study 
vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
In the Ad26.COV2.S group, a general trend for lower reactogenicity (solicited local and systemic AEs) 
was observed in adults ≥60 years compared to younger adults (18-59 years). This trend was not 
observed in the placebo group. Overall, the reactogenicity was similar in participants with positive or 
negative SARS-CoV-2-serostatus and/or PCR status at baseline in both groups. 
Solicited local AEs 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a frequency that was 
higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (53.1%) compared to participants in the placebo 
group (17.6%) (mainly grade 1 and 2). All solicited local AEs were transient in nature and reported as 
resolved. Grade 3 local solicited AEs were reported in 0.6% of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
(no grade 4). 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 109/151 
 
 
 
Solicited systemic AEs 
In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were headache 
(43.3%), fatigue (42.3%), and myalgia (37.1%) (mainly grade 1 and 2) (nausea 16.4% and pyrexia 
7.4%). Most solicited systemic AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Grade 3 solicited 
systemic AEs were reported in 2.3% of the subjects. There was one event of myalgia grade 4. 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile is similar to the initial assessment for conditional MA. 
5.7.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
Overall, unsolicited AEs were reported with similar frequencies in both groups: 13.6% of participants in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group and 12.5% of participants in the placebo group. Most unsolicited AEs were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity; Unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 were reported in 27 (0.8%) 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared with 23 (0.7%) in the placebo-group. Unsolicited AEs 
considered related to study vaccine by investigator were slightly more reported in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group (6.8%) compared to the placebo group (4.1%). The frequencies of SAEs (safety subset, post 
dose) were similar in both groups: 0.4% in Ad26.COV2.S group (13 SAEs including 2 considered as 
related to study vaccine by investigator) and 0.3% in placebo group (10 SAEs; none considered 
related). There was 1 fatal AE in the placebo group.  
In the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs, which were 
also recorded as solicited AEs, were headache (1.9% vs. 2.1%, respectively), myalgia (1.2% vs. 
1.5%), and fatigue (1.4% vs. 2.1%). The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs that were not 
recorded as solicited AEs were chills (2.1% vs. 0.7%), arthralgia (1.1% vs 0.8%), nasal congestion 
(1.2% vs. 1.1%), cough (1% vs. 1%), and diarrhoea (1% vs. 1%). Imbalances with higher 
frequencies in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus the placebo group were observed for the following 
unsolicited AEs: vaccination site pain (1.1% vs. 0.5%) and muscular weakness (0.3% vs. 0.1%). 
Unsolicited AEs related to vaccination by investigator assessment were reported for 6.8% and 4.1% of 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo group, respectively. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the 
most frequently reported unsolicited AEs related to vaccination were chills (1.7% vs. 0.3% in the 
placebo group), vaccination pain (1.1% vs. 0.4%, respectively), fatigue (0.9% vs. 1.2%), and 
headache (0.9% vs. 0.7%). 
Overall, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs are recognised ADRs of the Janssen COVID-19 
vaccine.The safety profile is similar to the initial assessment for conditional MA. 
5.7.2.4.  Fatal AEs and SAEs 
Fatal AEs 
In the FAS, 83 fatal events were reported in the double-blind phase: 28 in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
(0.1% of 21,898 subjects) and 55 in the placebo-group (0.3% of 21,890 subjects): 4 and 19, 
respectively, were reported in subjects SARS-CoV-2 positive during the study (mainly COVID-19 
associated deaths); 1 and 1, respectively in subjects SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (COVID-19 
pneumonia); and 23 and 35, respectively, in subjects without SARS-CoV-2 positive test during the 
study. The distribution of fatal events by SOC was balanced across groups and does not raise a 
concern: General disorders and administration site conditions (9 each), Cardiac disorders (5 each), 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 110/151 
 
 
 
Infections and infestations (4 vs. 5, respectively), Gastrointestinal disorders (2 vs. none), Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2 each), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1 vs. 2), 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) (1 vs. 2) (including 2 events in 
same subject in Ad26.COV2.S group); all the others events were reported only in placebo group. 
All fatal events reported during the double-blind phase were considered unrelated to the study vaccine 
(Ad26.COV2.S or placebo) by the investigator. 
Of note, during the entire study (double-blinded and open-labelled study), 103 fatal AEs were reported 
in 100 participants, of which 40 occurred in participants who received Ad26.COV2.S (0.1% of 35,581 
subjects). Four deaths were reported after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in the open-label phase 
(including 2 not related to COVID-19). One of these events was considered related to the study 
vaccine by the investigator. The participant was reported with grade 4 pulmonary embolism 57 days 
after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in the open-label phase. After database lock, upon review of the 
autopsy report, the investigator re-assessed this death to unrelated. No other death reported during 
the study was considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator. 
Overall, in the FAS, there were no fatal events considered related to Ad26.COV2.S. during the double-
blind phase and the open-labelled study, and there were less fatal AEs in Ad26.COV2.S. group 
compared to placebo group. 
SAEs 
In the FAS, a total of 235 (1.1% of 21,898 subjects) participants reported SAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group compared with 358 (1.6% of 21,890 subjects) participants in the placebo-group, during the 
double-blind phase. A total of 223 (1.0%) participants reported SAEs not associated with COVID-19 in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group compared with 265 (1.2%) participants in the placebo-group, during the 
double-blind phase. Among the SAEs not associated with COVID-19, overall, no major imbalances 
were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo 
groups were infections and infestations (0.2% [49 participants] in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.3% 
[61 participants] in the placebo group). All other SAEs were reported with frequencies by SOC ≤ 0.1% 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group. 
During the entire study (double-blinded and open-labelled study), 436 SAEs were reported in 
participants who received Ad26.COV2.S (1.2% of 35,581 subjects). 
Additional details have been provided about SAEs considered related to the study vaccine by 
investigator assessment: During the entire study, 19 participants reported a total of 21 SAEs which 
were considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator: 19 events (reported by 18 
participants) after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination (3 cases of ischemic stroke, 2 cases of Bell’s Palsy, 2 
cases of pulmonary embolism, 2 cases of deep vein thrombosis, GBS, venous thrombosis limb, retinal 
vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, pericarditis, complex regional pain syndrome, post vaccination 
syndrome, hypersensitivity, headache and asthma; some of them reported after cross-over 
vaccination) and 2 events (reported by 1 participant) after placebo (Epstein-Barr virus infection and 
atrial flutter). 
One SAE of thromboembolic event with thrombocytopenia (venous transverse sinus thrombosis and 
cerebral hemorrhage) reported following administration of Ad26.COV2.S was confirmed as thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia meeting both Level 1 criteria using the Brighton Collaboration level of certainty 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition for a tier 1 TTS case and could

therefore be confirmed as TTS according to both case definitions. Venous thromboembolism and TTS 
are recognized ADRs in the SmPC. Non-haemorrhagic stroke is an identified AESI in the RMP. 
In study COV3001, 14 SAEs of supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter were 
reported after vaccination in 12 participants (7 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 5 in placebo group). Of 
these 14 SAEs, 2 (1 atrial flutter [placebo group], 1 atrial fibrillation [Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp group]) 
were considered related to study vaccination by the investigator. However, for the event in the active 
group, based on the pre-existing risk factors and long time to onset of 181 days, the event of atrial 
fibrillation is assessed to have an inconsistent causal association to vaccination, per WHO causality 
classification for adverse events following immunization. 19 SAEs of supraventricular tachycardia, atrial 
fibrillation, or atrial flutter were reported after vaccination in 18 participants in other Ad26.COV2 
clinical trials: in studies COV3009 (7 in Ad26.COV2.S group, 5 in placebo group and 3 after crossover), 
COV1001 (1 in Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp, Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp group), COV1002 (1 in Ad26.COV2.S 
5×1010 vp group), and COV2008 (1 blind), none of which were considered related to study vaccination 
by the investigator. 
The MAH also provided a cumulative review from reports of supraventricular tachycardia, atrial 
fibrillation, or atrial flutter received from post-marketing experience until 24th August 2021, a total of 
200 case reports of arrhythmias were reported, majority from the US (n=123). Of the 200 cases, 82 
concerned males, 108 females, and 10 did not report sex. The age range was 18 to 95 years. Among 
the Arrythmia cases, a total of 55 cases were reported as atrial fibrillation and a further 5 were 
reported as atrial flutter. A further 46 were reported as arrhythmia (not further specified) and 37 as 
heart rate irregular (not further specified). The mean and median time to onset was 11.9 days and 3 
days, respectively. Observed versus Expected (O/E) analysis in the US and EU did not raise any 
concern. 
In conclusion, cumulative analysis of clinical and post-marketing safety data of events of 
supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter did not show an increase in risk following 
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. 
5.7.2.5.  Medically-attended Adverse Events 
In the FAS, double blind phase, similar frequency of subjects reported at least one MAAEs of grade 3 in 
both groups: 1.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 1.6% in the placebo group. No MAAEs grade 3 were 
reported with higher frequency in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group. 
Additional details have been provided about MAAEs not associated with COVID-19. The overall 
frequency of MAAEs not associated with COVID-19 was similar in both groups: 7.4% versus 8.0% in 
the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups, respectively (with similar distribution by SOC). 
The overall frequency of MAAEs assessed as related to the study vaccine, not associated with COVID-
19, was similar in both the Ad26.COV2.S (54 MAAEs – 0.2%) and placebo group (37 MAAEs – 0.2%). 
In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the MAAEs were mainly in the following SOCs: general disorders and 
administration site conditions (13 MAAEs), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (13 
MAAEs), nervous system (8 MAAEs) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (7 MAAEs). 
5.7.2.6.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
No unsolicited AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported.

5.7.2.7.  AESIs 
The MAH has provided more details about AESIs reported in COV3001. Only TTS was defined as an 
AESI for the COVID-19 vaccine program, but in addition, a number of Adverse Events of Interest 
(AEIs) was established, based on either a numerical imbalance and/or potential causal relationship 
identified: allergic reactions, tinnitus, convulsions/seizures, thrombotic and thromboembolic events, 
demyelinating disorders/GBS, and Bell’s palsy.  
In the FAS, similar frequency of subjects reported at least one treatment emergent AEI in both groups 
(1.7% in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 1.6% in the placebo group). Few reported AESIs were assessed 
as related: 0.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 0.1% participants in the placebo group. 
There were some numerical imbalances in the occurrence of some AEIs between the Ad26.COV2.S and 
placebo group: tinnitus (15 vs. 4, respectively), seizure (7 vs. 2), rash (46 vs. 35), urticaria (13 vs. 6), 
deep vein thrombosis (11 vs. 3), pulmonary embolism (10 vs. 5), and ischemic stroke (3 vs. none). 
There was no anaphylaxis reported in the active group (vs. 1 in the placebo), 1 GBS in each group, 
and no immune thrombocytopenia reported in the active group (vs. 1 in the placebo group. 
There were 53 subjects with AEIs assessed as related to vaccination in the active group (0.2%) versus 
21 in the placebo group (0.1%). The following related AEIs by investigator assessment were 
numerically imbalanced between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo group: tinnitus (3 vs. none, 
respectively), hypersensitivity events (29 vs. 11, with in particular: rash (15 vs. 7), urticaria (4 vs. 
none), and eyelid oedema (2 vs. none)), thromboembolic events (4 vs. none: 2 deep vein thrombosis, 
1 ischemic stroke and 1 retinal vein thrombosis in active group) and haemorrhagic disorders (9 vs. 3, 
mainly local injection site AEs). 
Most of these events (Tinnitus, rash, hypersensitivity, urticaria, venous thromboembolism (including 
pulmonary embolism), Guillain-Barré syndrome, Immune thrombocytopenia, injection site erythema 
and swelling) are recognized ADRs in the SmPC. Non-haemorrhagic stroke and generalized convulsion 
are identified AESIs and are events under close monitoring. 
With regards to the occurrence of seizures, the MAH has clarified that, in study COV3001, there were 
21 events of seizure/convulsion reported by 20 participants. Twelve events were reported in the 
Ad26.COV2.S, 7 in the placebo group and 2 after a crossover vaccination. Six of these events were 
serious and they were all assessed as not related to vaccination: 2 in the Ad26.COV2.S, 2 in the 
placebo group (including 1 fatal) and 2 after a crossover vaccination (including 1 fatal). One non-
serious adverse event was considered as related to study vaccination by the Investigator. The event 
was reported in an 18-29 year old participant that received Ad26.COV2.S and 115 days after 
vaccination presented an increase on the frequency of seizures of that lasted 5 days and recovered. 
Six events of seizures were also reported in study COV3009, which were balanced between 
Ad26.COV2.S and placebo (3 on each group). All events were non-serious and considered as not 
related to study vaccination. No events of seizures were reported in other clinical trials up to the DLP. 
A total of 226 cases of seizures were received from post marketing sources until the DLP of 24 August 
2021. Review of the cases, including demographics, concomitant medications, concurrent 
conditions/medical history, outcome, and seriousness received during this reporting period is 
consistent wth what is currently known about the occurrence of convulsions/seizures from the clinical 
trials data. A review of the results for the US and EU broad analysis Observed versus expected analysis 
in EU and US did not raise any concern.

In conclusion, based on the cumulative analysis of all available data, no safety concern has been 
identified for seizure/convulsions. In COV3001, from the 12 potential TTS cases in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group (in 11 subjects), there were 6 classified as possible according to the specified definition criteria 
(including 1 assessed as related to the study vaccine by Investigator), and 1 confirmed case of TTS 
(but considered as non-related). From the 6 potential TTS cases in the Placebo crossover to 
Ad26.COV2.S group (in 2 subjects), 3 were classified as possible according to the definitioncriteria 
(none of them were assessed as related to the study vaccine by Investigator). TTS is a recognised 
adverse drug reaction for Ad26.COV2.S. 
5.8.  Study COV3009  
5.8.1.  Methods 
VAC31518COV3009 is an ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3, 
pivotal efficacy and safety study in adults 18 years of age or older. The efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S is being evaluated in participants living in, or going to, locations with 
high risk for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection after administration of 2 doses of study vaccine. The 
planned total sample size was up to approximately 30,000 participants. 
In the double-blind phase, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 2 doses of 
Ad26.COV2.S or placebo with a 56-day interval. The study vaccines were administered by 
intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5×1010 
vp. 
Following EUA and/or conditional licensure for the single dose schedule, based on the 
VAC31518COV3001 primary analysis results, all participants from countries where protocol 
amendment 4 was approved by Health Authority and IEC/IRB were gradually unblinded and the 
unblinded participants entered the open-label part of the study. After unblinding, a single dose of 
Ad26.COV2.S was offered to enrolled participants who initially received placebo and enter the open-
label vaccination phase of the study while participants from the Ad26.COV2.S arm continued in the 
same arm to receive their second active dose, if applicable. 
A total of 31,300 participants were randomized and vaccinated in the double-blind phase of the study 
(15,708 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 15,592 in the placebo-group). During the double-blind phase, 
14,549 (46.5%) participants received only one dose of study vaccine (7,053 received Ad26.COV2.S 
and 7,496 received placebo) and 16,751 (53.5%) participants received two doses of study vaccine 
(8,655 received Ad26.COV2.S and 8,096 received placebo). 
At the data cut-off for this analysis (25 June 2021), 71.2% and 28.4% of participants had completed 2 
months of follow-up after the first and booster vaccinations, respectively.  
Summaries of deaths, SAEs, MAAEs, AESIs, and AEIs are based on the FAS (31,300 participants; 
15,708 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 15,592 in the placebo group at dose 1). In the FAS, the overall 
median exposure time in the Ad26.COV2.S group was: 71 days after the first vaccination and 38 days 
after second vaccination. 
Summaries of solicited and unsolicited AEs are based on the Safety subset (ie, a subset of the FAS), 
which included 6,068 participants (3,016 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3,052 in the placebo group) 
for dose 1. For dose 2, the Safety subset contains 1,559 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 114/151 
 
 
 
1,425 participants in the placebo group. Overall, 71.1% of the subjects have completed 2 months 
follow-up after 1st vaccination. After the 1st dose, the median follow-up is 72 days for all subjects (in 
Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups). After the 2nd dose 56 days after dose 1, the median follow-up is 40 
days for all subjects (in both groups). 
Topline (TLR) results for the double-blind phase have been submitted (data cutoff: 25 June 2021). 
5.8.2.  Results 
5.8.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Overall in the FAS, 76.4% of participants were white and were mainly coming from Europe (41%) and 
United States (38.9%). 52.6% of participants were males. The median age was 53 years (range: 18; 
99 years) and 35.9% of participants were ≥60 years of age. The median BMI was 26.6 kg/m2 (range: 
14-73.2 kg/m2). 41.4% of subjects had at least 1 comorbidity at baseline; The main comorbidity being 
obesity (25.7% of subjects). There were 1,791 participants with positive SARS-CoV-2-Serostatus 
and/or PCR status at baseline in the 5.1010 vp group and 1,756 in the placebo group. 
Demographic characteristics were similar in the Safety subset. There were 337 participants with 
positive SARS-CoV-2-Serostatus and/or PCR status at baseline in the 5.1010 vp group and 337 in the 
placebo group. No relevant differences in demographics and baseline characteristics were observed 
between the Ad26.COV2.S group and the placebo-group in any of the predefined analysis sets.  
Details about intake of concomitant medications have been provided. In the FAS, 
analgesics/antipyretics were used by 1,065 (6.8%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S and 360 (2.3%) 
participants in the placebo group up to 7 days post-vaccination. The most frequently used 
analgesics/antipyretics were paracetamol, and ibuprofen with a frequency that was higher in 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to participants in the placebo group. More 
participants used analgesics/antipyretics after the first vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (5.5%) than 
after the second vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (4.1%) (in placebo: 1.6% post-dose 1 and 1.6% post-
dose 2). 
Corticosteroids were used by approximately 3.2% to 3.5% of participants in both the active and 
placebo group during the 28-day post-vaccination periods (with similar frequencies post-dose 1 and 
post-dose 2). 
In the safety subset,more participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group reported the use of medication as 
compared to placebo (20.4% versus 7.6%) mainly driven by the use of medication in the context of 
treatment of solicited symptoms. The use of medication was similar after the booster dose (second 
dose) compared to the first dose in both groups (16.7% post-dose 1 and 15.6% post-dose 2 in 
Ad26.COV2.S group, and 5.6% post-dose 1 and 5.3% post-dose 2 in placebo group). 
5.8.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
In general, the overall frequencies for local and systemic solicited AEs were similar post dose 1 versus 
post dose 2 of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (2 months apart). As expected, the frequencies for local and 
systemic solicited AEs were higher in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo-group post 
dose 1 and post dose 2. In both groups, the majority of the solicited systemic AEs were considered 
related to the use of the study vaccine as per investigator assessment. 
Type II variation assessment report

Solicited local AEs 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain, with a frequency that was 
higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to participants in the placebo group, and 
with a frequency similar post-dose 1 (54.2% and 18.2%, respectively) and post-dose 2 (56.3% and 
15.8%, respectively) (mainly grade 1 and 2). 
All solicited local AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Grade 3 solicited local AEs 
were reported in 19 (0.6%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, post-dose 1 (0.3%) and post-dose 
2 (0.6%). No Grade 4 solicited local AEs were reported. 
A general trend for lower reactogenicity in both Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo groups, was observed 
inadults 60 years of age and older compared to adults 18-59 years. 
Local reactogenicity was transient, with a median duration of 2-3 days after vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S. 
Solicited systemic AEs 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were fatigue, headache, and myalgia. The 
frequencies of all solicited systemic AEs were slightly higher post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2 in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group: fatigue (44.9% vs. 41.1%, respectively), headache (42.8% vs. 35.8%), 
myalgia (38.9% vs. 34.7%), nausea (18.1% vs. 14.4%) and pyrexia (5% vs. 2.4%). However, this 
trends is also observed in the placebo group: fatigue (24.9% vs. 20.6%, respectively), headache 
(24.5% vs. 18.9%), myalgia (15.3% vs. 13.1%), nausea (10.4% vs. 7%) and pyrexia (0.5% vs. 
0.3%). 
The frequency of solicited systemic AEs was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, 
compared to participants in the placebo group (post-dose 1 and post-dose 2). Most solicited systemic 
AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were reported in 
76 (2.5%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, post-dose 1 (1.8%) and post-dose 2 (1.6%). No 
Grade 4 solicited systemic AEs were reported. 
A general trend for lower reactogenicity in both Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo groups was observed in 
adults 60 years of age or older compared to adults 18-59 years of age. 
Systemic reactogenicity was transient, with a median duration of 1-2 days after vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S. 
5.8.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
Overall, in the safety subset, unsolicited AEs were reported for 18.6% of participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 13.7% of participants in the placebo group. In both groups, the frequency of 
unsolicited AEs was slightly higher after the 1st (15.1% and 10.9%, respectively) compared to the 2nd 
dose (10.2% and 8.4%) (2 months apart) (mainly grade 1 and 2). In both groups, the frequency of 
unsolicited AEs considered related to the study vaccine was slightly higher after the 1st (9.4% and 
5.9%, respectively) compared to the 2nd dose (5.1% and 3.4%). There were no fatal AE. In the 
Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequencies of SAE were similar post-dose 1 (8 subjects – 0.3% including 1 
considered related to vaccine) and post-dose 2 (2 subjects – 0.1%; none considered related to 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

vaccine). In the placebo group, the frequencies of SAE were similar post-dose 1 (7 subjects – 0.2%; 
none considered related to vaccine) and post-dose 2 (2 subjects – 0.1%; none considered related to 
vaccine). 
In the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs, which were 
also recorded as solicited AEs, were headache, fatigue, and myalgia, with slightly higher frequencies 
post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2: 
-  Ad26.COV2.S group: headache (3.5% post-dose 1 and 2.2% post-dose 2), fatigue (3.5% and 
1.9%, respectively), and myalgia (2.7% and 1.4%, respectively) 
- 
Placebo group: headache (3.2% post-dose 1 and 1.8% post-dose 2), fatigue (3.1% and 2%, 
respectively), and myalgia (2.2% and 1.5%, respectively) 
In the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs that were 
not recorded as solicited AEs were chills and arthralgia, with slightly higher (or similar) frequencies 
post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2: 
-  Ad26.COV2.S group: chills (0.7% post-dose 1 and 0.5% post-dose 2), and arthralgia (0.6% and 
0.4%, respectively) 
- 
Placebo group: chills (0.2% post-dose 1 and 0.1% post-dose 2), and arthralgia (0.2% and 0.2%, 
respectively) 
Numerical imbalances with higher frequencies in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus the placebo group 
were observed for the following unsolicited AEs: 
- 
Tonsilitis was reported for 2 (0.1%) versus 0 participants post-dose 1 and 3 (0.2%) versus 0 
participants post-booster dose (second dose). The sponsor considers that no biological plausibility 
is established and that it is unlikely that these events were associated with Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccination. No numerical imbalances for tonislitis were observed in study COV3001. 
- 
Feeling abnormal was reported for 10 (0.3%) versus 9 (<0.3%) participants post-dose 1 and 3 
(0.2%) versus 0 participants post-booster dose (second dose). Symptoms reported as ‘feeling 
abnormal’ are unspecific symptoms. One of the reported terms was ‘brain fog’ associated with 
dizziness, which is already listed as an adverse drug reactions in the product information. No 
numerical imbalances were observed in study COV3001 (feeling abnormal reported for 6 
participant in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 5 in the placebo group). 
-  Abdominal pain was reported for 12 (0.4%) versus 4 (0.1%) participants post-dose 1 and 3 
(0.2%) versus 0 participants post-booster dose (second dose). Decreased appetite was reported 
for 11 (0.4%) versus 6 (0.2%) participants post-dose 1 and 1 (0.1%) versus 1 (0.1%) participants 
post-booster dose (second dose). Both abdominal pain and decreased appetite were in several 
cases co-reported with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is already listed as an adverse drug reaction.  
Overall, these numerical imbalances do not raise any new safety concern for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. 
AEs of at least Grade 3 in severity were reported for 0.7% and 0.8% of participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group post-dose 1 and post-booster dose (second dose), respectively (vs. 0.5% and 
0.5%, respectively, in placebo group). Post-dose 1, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE of at 
least Grade 3 in severity was headache (0.3%) (0.1% in placebo group). Post-booster dose (second 
dose), nausea (2 participants [0.1%]) was the only unsolicited AE of at least Grade 3 in severity 
reported for more than 1 participant (0% in placebo group). 
Unsolicited AEs related to vaccination were reported for 9.4% and 5.1% of participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group post-dose 1 and post-booster dose (second dose), respectively (vs. 5.9% and 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 117/151 
 
 
 
3.4%, respectively, in placebo group). In both groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs 
related to vaccination were fatigue (2.7% and 1.4% in Ad26.COV2.S group; 2.4% and 1.5% in placebo 
group) and headache (2.6% and 1.4% in Ad26.COV2.S group; 2.2% and 1.2% in placebo group) 
which are both recognised adverse drug reaction for Ad26.COV2.S. 
5.8.2.4.  Immediate Adverse Events 
Solicited and unsolicited immediate AEs were infrequent (<0.5% of participants post-dose 1 or post-
booster dose (second dose). Immediate hypersensitivity reactions following vaccination were rare and 
non-serious. No immediate severe allergic (anaphylaxis) reactions were reported. Anxiety-related 
reactions to vaccination, including vasovagal reactions such as syncope and presyncope, were rare 
(<0.1%), and evenly distributed between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups post-dose 1 and post-
booster dose (second dose). 
5.8.2.5.  Fatal AEs and SAEs 
Fatal AEs 
Up to the cut-off date of 25 June 2021, in the FAS, 17 fatal AEs were reported during the double-
blind phase: 4 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 13 in the placebo group. 
Of the 4 deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group, none had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test during the 
study. The causes of death by preferred term were lung adenocarcinoma and death of unknown cause 
after the first dose, and, after the booster dose (second dose), cerebral haemorrhage (13 days after 
2nd injection) and myocardial infarction (41 days after 2nd injection) all of which were considered not 
related to vaccination by investigator assessment.  
In the placebo group, 6 of the 13 deaths had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the study, and the 
causes of death in these participants were COVID-19 or COVID-19 pneumonia. 
There were 5 fatal cases that occurred between the data cut-off (25 June 2021) and database lock 
(DBL) (23 August 2021) in participants who received Ad26.COV2.S in COV3009: myocardial infarction 
117 days after the booster dose (second dose) (possible TTS case), grade 4 bilateral COVID positive 
phenumonia with hypoxemia 51 days after booster dose (second dose), stage 4 breast cancer 129 
days after vaccination with the first dose, unspecificed death in a 50-59 year old participant 162 days 
after vaccination and one unspecified death in an over 85 year old participant at an unknown time 
after vaccination. All these events were considered not related to vaccination by the investigator. 
When considering the double-blind and open-label phases combined, 26 deaths were reported up to 
the cutoff date of 25 June 2021, of which 10 occurred in participants who received Ad26.COV2.S (1 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 cerebral haemorrhage, 1 COVID-19 pneumonia, 1 overdose 
of heroin, 1 lung adenocarcinoma, 3 myocardial infarction and 2 deaths from unknown causes). None 
of these deaths were considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator. Only 1 death in the 
placebo group was considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator but not related by the 
sponsor. This participant was enrolled in the placebo group and received after unblinding an open-label 
vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 36 days after receiving the initial placebo vaccination. This 
participant was reported with a Grade 4 SAE of respiratory distress on the night of receiving the open-
label Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The same day, the participant was admitted to the hospital, where the 
participant passed away 28 days later. Underlying cause of death was acute respiratory distress 
syndrome due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

In the double-blind phase of the study, SAEs were reported for 240 participants in the FAS (104 
[0.7%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 136 [0.9%] participants in the placebo group). A 
total of 98 (0.6%) participants reported SAEs not associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
compared to 104 (0.7%) participants in the placebo group. A total of 8 (0.1%) participants reported 
SAEs associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared with 36 (0.2%) participants in 
the placebo group. 
No increase in the frequency of SAEs (all and those not associated with COVID-19) was observed post-
booster dose (second dose) compared with post-dose 1 Among the SAEs not associated with COVID-
19, no significant numerical imbalances were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S by system organ class. 
Among all SAEs reported during the double-blind phase, excluding COVID-19 associated events, 11 
participants experienced a total of 13 SAEs that were considered related by investigator assessment (8 
[0.1%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S and 3 [<0.1%] participants in the placebo group). In the 
Ad26.COV2.S group after the first dose, the related SAEs were pyrexia, pericarditis, allergy to vaccine, 
and hemoptysis in 1 participant each, and injection site swelling, vertigo, and myocardial necrosis 
marker increased in 1 participant. Related SAEs after the blinded booster dose (second dose) were 
facial paresis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident in 1 participant each. Only the SAE 
of allergy was considered related to the study vaccine by the MAH. 
In the pooled analysis, including double-blind and open label phase, among all participants who 
received Ad26.COV2.S during the study, 4 additional participants reported a total of 6 SAEs considered 
related by the investigator: cerebrovascular accident / stroke 30 days after 2nd dose of active vaccine; 
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia 86 days after 1st dose of active vaccine, and cellulitis of the right leg 
and deep vein thrombosis 99 days after 1st dose of active vaccine; thrombosis of the vena saphena 
magna of the right leg 58 days after the booster dose (second dose) of active vaccine; thrombosis of 
the right leg 20 days after the booster dose (second dose) of active vaccine. All these SAEs were 
considered as not related by the MAH. 
5.8.2.6.  Medically-attended Adverse Events 
In the double-blind phase of the study, at least 1 MAAE was reported for 1,033 (6.6%) participants in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group and 1,003 (6.4%) participants in the placebo group (no increase in the 
frequency of MAAEs was observed post-booster (second dose) compared with post-dose 1). 
The frequency of subjects with ≥ grade 3 MAAEs was similar in Ad26.COV2.S (157 – 1%) and placebo 
groups (191 – 1.2%). 
Slightly more participants had 1 or more related MAAEs not associated with COVID-19 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (92 [0.6%]) than the placebo group (47 [0.3%]). The most frequently reported 
related MAAEs not associated with COVID-19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group were headache (10 [0.1%] 
participants) and fatigue (9 [0.1%] participants). 
5.8.2.7.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
Three participants reported AEs resulting in study discontinuation in the double-blind phase (safety 
subset): 1 (urticaria) in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 2 (COVID-19) in the placebo group. Six 
participants reported AEs resulting in study treatment discontinuation: 1 (urticaria) in the 
Ad26.COV2.S groups and 5 (COVID-19 infection/pneumonia) in the placebo group.  
During the entire study (FAS), up to the cutoff date of 25 June 2021, 5 participants in the 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 119/151 
 
 
 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 10 participants in the placebo group discontinued the study due to an AE (one 
event occurred after unblinding). Two events were considered related: 1 in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
(Grade 3 AE of urticaria reported 6 days post-dose 1) and 1 in the placebo group (Grade 1 AE of 
ventricular extrasystoles reported 27 days post-dose 1). Thirty AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were reported in 28 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, of which 2 events were 
reported after unblinding. In the placebo group, 44 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 
reported in 35 participants, of which 3 events were reported after unblinding. Ten events in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group that led to study treatment discontinuation were considered related. 
5.8.2.8.  AESIs 
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a recognised adverse drug reaction (frequency 
very rare) in the product information of Ad26.COV2.S following the assessment of a safety signal from 
post-marketing data. TTS was considered an AESI and is closely monitored in all available sources, 
including clinical studies. A thrombotic event or thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below 
150,000/μL [Brighton 2021]) alone was considered a suspected AESI for further investigation. 
In the double-blind phase of the COV3009, at least 1 suspected AESI (thrombotic event or 
thrombocytopenia) was reported for 18 (0.1%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (13 participants 
after the first dose and 5 participants after the booster dose (second dose)) and 22 (0.1%) 
participants in the placebo group. The majority were thromboembolic events, reported for 14 (0.1%) 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 18 (0.1%) participants in the placebo group. 
Thrombocytopenia was reported as a suspected AESI for 4 (<0.1%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group and 5 (<0.1%) participants in the placebo group. 
Additional detail on possible TTS cases is provided below: 
In the placebo group: 
- 
a 50-59 year-old subject had cerebrovascular accident and hemiparesis on Day 36. The case met 
the PRAC criteria of a possible case of TTS and was considered as not related to the blinded study 
vaccine. 
- 
a 60-69 year-old subject had deep vein thrombosis on Day 27 (double-blind phase) and 
subsequently pulmonary embolism on Day 29 (open-label phase) in combination with 
thrombocytopenia. The case met the PRAC criteria of a possible case of TTS and was considered as 
not related to the blinded study vaccine. 
- 
a 50-59 year-old subject who developed myocardial infarction and peripheral artery thrombosis 68 
and 78 days, respectively, after the first vaccination (criteria not meet according to PRAC criteria 
and considered as not related to the blinded study vaccine). 
In the Ad26.COV2.S group: 
-  Deep vein thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia was reported for 1 participant in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group 100 days post-vaccination 1 (60-69 year-old subject). This participant was 
unblinded before the event and is therefore counted in the open-label phase. The case met the 
PRAC criteria of a possible case of TTS, and was considered as related to study vaccine by 
Investigator. 
-  Subject was a 60-69 year-old who developed myocardial infarction (fatal). The serious event of 
myocardial infarction occurred 175 days after the first vaccination and 118 days after the second 
vaccination. Non serious thrombocytopenia was reported. The case met the PRAC criteria of a 
possible case of TTS, and the Investigator considered the event of myocardial infarction not related 
Type II variation assessment report

to the blinded study vaccine (in particular because of the too long time-to-onset). 
During the double-blind phase, numerical imbalances were observed for the following adverse events 
of interest: rash (35 [0.2%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 22 [0.1%] participants in 
the placebo group), urticaria (16 [0.1%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 7 [<0.1%] 
participants in the placebo group), tinnitus (9 [0.1%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 5 
[<0.1%] participants in the placebo group), and Bell’s Palsy (2 [<0.1%] participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group versus 0 participants in the placebo group). No notable numerical imbalance 
between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group was observed for facial paralysis (3 versus 2 
cases). Two of the 3 facial paralysis cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group were Bell’s palsy, which both 
occurred after the first dose. The third case was facial paresis, which occurred post-booster dose 
(second dose). 
No trends for numerical imbalances were observed for convulsions/seizures, deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, or pericarditis. No cases of GBS, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), or 
encephalitis were reported during the double-blind phase. In the double-blind phase, arterial embolic 
and thrombotic events were reported for fewer participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group than placebo 
group (6 versus 9). 
TTS, venous thromboembolism, rash, and urticaria, and tinnitus are recognized ADRs in the SmPC. 
Bell’s palsy, acute aseptic arthritis and non-haemorrhagic stroke are AESIs in the RMP and are being 
closely monitored. 
During the double-blind phase, the reporting rate of arthritis in the Ad26.COV2.S group was higher 
compared to the placebo group (38 [0.2%] vs 22 [0.1%] cases). The majority of the events occurred 
post-dose 1 (24 [0.2%] versus 12 [0.1%] cases in the 28-day period post-dose 1); fewer events were 
observed in the 28-day period post-dose 2 (4 [<0.1%] versus 5 [0.1%] cases). The events reported in 
the category of arthritis in the Ad26.COV2.S group included arthritis, osteoarthritis, periarthritis, gout, 
spinal osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, and oligoarthritis. During the double-blind phase, SAEs in the 
category of arthritis were reported for 4 participants in the study (2 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 2 
in the placebo group), all of which were considered not to be related to vaccination. In the 
Ad26.COV2.S group, SAEs of sub-acromioclavicular osteoarthritis and worsening osteoarthritis were 
reported for 1 participant each 16 and 50 days, respectively, after the first dose. In the placebo group, 
2 participants had SAEs of worsening osteoarthritis. Two nonserious AEs in the category of arthritis 
were considered related to vaccination: gout flare reported 8 days after the first vaccination and 
oligoarthritis reported 13 days after the first vaccination, both of which were reported for participants 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group. In study COV3001, these imbalances were not observed (reported for 40 
[0.2%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S groups compared to 42 [0.2%] in the placebo group during 
the double-blind phase) and post-marketing monitoring did not raise any safety signal or concern for 
arthritis. 
The majority of participants with these events had previous history of Arthritis or osteoarthritis. The 
main numerical difference was in gout and gouty arthritis with 8 events in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 
1 event in Placebo. All participants except one participant in the Ad26.COV2.S group had medical 
history of Gout or predisposing factors. There were 8 participants with AEs of periarthritis, 6 in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 2 in the placebo group, most with a history of such events. All events in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group involved shoulder and one involved wrist. For immune mediated arthritis, there 
was one event in the placebo group (Psoriatic Arthropathy).

Since launch till 24 August 2021, 243 cases reporting acute aseptic arthritis from post-marketing 
sources were identified. These 243 cases reported 250 events of interest (61 serious, 189 non-serious) 
and the most frequently reported country of origin was the Republic of Korea (n=124). Of the 243 
cases, 125 concerned males, 106 females, and 12 had no sex reported. The age range was 19 to 84 
years. The most commonly reported preferred terms (n≥2) included arthritis (n=173), rheumatoid 
arthritis (n=27), gout (n=12), periarthritis (n=10), 4 each of osteoarthritis and spinal osteoarthritis, 3 
each of temporomandibular joint syndrome, facet joint syndrome, Still's disease, and 2 each of acute 
aseptic arthritis, polyarthritis, and rheumatic disorder. The mean and median time to onset was 6.4 
days and 2 days, respectively. Where reported (n=118), the outcomes were reported as not resolved 
(n=62), resolved (n=38), resolving (n=17), and resolved with sequelae (n=1). A broad O/E analysis 
for the US and EU and the sensitivity analysis showed an O/E ratio of <1 in the US and EU for both age 
groups. A restricted O/E analysis was not required. 
In conclusion, although a numerical imbalance has been observed in COV3009, this finding was not 
replicated in the other large phase 3 study COV3001. No signal has been identified from post-
marketing experience 
During the double-blind phase, hemorrhagic disorders reported for a low percentage of participants in 
the Ad26.COV2.S group and the placebo group (55 [0.4%] versus 29 [0.2%], respectively). This was 
also observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group in the 28 days post-dose reporting 
period (24 [0.2%] versus 14 [0.1%] cases post-dose 1, and 17 [0.2%] versus 7 [0.1%] cases post-
dose 2). This included 6 [<0.1%] SAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group: cerebral haemorrhage, worsening 
of haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, haemothorax, upper gastrointestinal bleed and urethral bleeding, which 
were considered not related to vaccination, and a related event of hemoptysis which occurred 66 days 
post dose 1. In the placebo group, 2 [<0.1%] SAEs of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and lower 
gastrointestinal bleed were reported, both of which were considered not related to vaccination. When 
considering the 28 days post-dose reporting period, SAEs of hemorrhagic disorders were reported for 1 
(<0.1%; worsening of haemorrhagic ovarian cyst) versus 1 (<0.1%; lower gastrointestinal bleed) 
participants after the first dose and 2 (<0.1%; urethral bleeding and cerebral haemorrhage) versus 0 
participants post-booster dose (second dose) in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus the placebo group. At 
the high-level term, the numerical imbalances let to the assessment in more depths of the events at 
the system organ class level. Disregarding events related to trauma, injury, or injection site AEs, no 
imbalances were seen for any system organ class within the 28 days post each dose. Injury was 
reported in 13 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 4 in the placebo group. This 
imbalance is mainly driven by contusion due to injury (9 versus 2), none were injection site related. 
Platelet counts are not available for these hemorrhagic events as there were no safety laboratory 
samples collected in study COV3009. In study COV3001, this imbalance was not observed for the 
Ad26.COV2.S group versus the placebo group in COV3001 for the primary analysis (22 [0.1%] versus 
25 [0.1%]) or final analysis (48 [0.2%] versus 77 [0.4%]) of the double-blind phase. 
5.9.  Study DMID 21-0012  
5.9.1.  Methods 
This is an is an ongoing Phase 1/2 Study of Delayed Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Dosing (Boost) 
after Receipt of EUA Vaccines (conducted by NIH/NIAID in the US). 
The MAH submitted the Safety Monitoring Committee report (SMCR), where only data from Groups 4E, 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 122/151 
 
 
 
5E and 6E of Cohort 1 are presented (data cut-off date: 24 September 2021): homologous or 
heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp at least 12 weeks after primary 
vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen (2 doses of Moderna-mRNA-1273 or 
Pfizer/BioNTech-BNT162b2) or Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp. 
All the data discussed here has been collected under Versions 2.0-4.0 of the protocol (not submitted). 
Persons who have previously received COVID-19 vaccine under EUA dosing guidelines, completing 
their regimen at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment, were recruited in cohort 1. Each participant in 
Cohort 1 is followed for approximately 1 year and is expected to complete 7 visits. 
A total of 150 participants have been enrolled into Groups 4E to 6E of Cohort 1, all receiving the 
Janssen Ad26.COV2.S booster vaccination at the 5×1010 vp dose level: 50 participants in Group 4E 
(EUA Dosed Janssen Ad26.COV2.S), 49 participants in Group 5E (EUA Dosed Moderna mRNA-1237) 
and 51 participants in Group 6E (EUA Dosed Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2). All 150 enrolled participants 
received the study delayed boost vaccination, all 150 participants have remained in the study and no 
discontinuations have been reported. All participants had completed the Day 14 visit and 148 (98.7%) 
had completed the Day 29 visit (after booster vaccination). No participants in these groups have yet 
reached Day 91 or later visits. 
The mean delay between the last primary dose and Janssen booster vaccination was 17.7 weeks after 
Janssen primary vaccination, 19.3 weeks after second dose of Moderna and 20.6 weeks after the 
second dose of Pfizer. 
5.9.2.  Results 
5.9.2.1.  Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Of the 150 enrolled participants, most (84.7%) were white and 56.0% were male. Half (50.0%) of the 
participants were between 18- and 55 years of age, and half (50.0%) were at least 56 years of age 
with a median age of 55.0 years (range 20-77). The median BMI was 26.9 kg/m2 (range 17.0-46.5 
kg/m2). 
Overall, these characteristics were similar in each group. However, there were more male in group 5E 
(67.3%) vs. group 6E (54.9%) vs. group 4E (46%). And there were more Asian in groups 5E (10.2%) 
and 6E (11.8%) vs. group 4E (6%). 
5.9.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain and/or tenderness reported in 108 (72.0%) 
participants with similar frequencies in each group: 37 (74%) in group 4E, 35 (71.4%) in 5E, and 36 
(70.6%) in 6E. Erythema/redness (11.3%) and induration/swelling (10.7%) were reported slightly less 
frequently in group 5E compared to 4E and 6E: 2 (4.1%) and 2 (4.1%), respectively, in 5E; 7 (14%) 
and 9 (18%) in 4E; 8 (15.7%) and 5 (9.8%) in 6E. 
All were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, except for 1 local solicited event of Grade 3 pain and/or tenderness 
reported on Day 3 in group 5E. No Grade 4 events were reported. 
All solicited systemic AE were less frequently reported in group 4E compared to groups 5E and 6E (in 
particular chills and fever). 
Type II variation assessment report

The most frequently reported solicited systemic AE were malaise and/or fatigue reported in 107 
(71.3%) participants: 31 (62%) in group 4E, 38 (77.6%) in 5E, and 38 (74.5%) in 6E. Myalgia were 
reported in 88 (58.7%) participants: 25 (50%) in group 4E, 32 (65.3%) in 5E, and 31 (60.8%) in 6E. 
Headache were reported in 72 (48%) participants: 24 (48%) in group 4E, 25 (51%) in 5E, and 23 
(45.1%) in 6E. Chills were reported in 49 (32.7%) participants: 9 (18%) in group 4E, 23 (46.9%) in 
5E, and 17 (33.3%) in 6E. Arthralgia were reported in 47 (31.3%) participants: 10 (20%) in group 4E, 
17 (34.7%) in 5E, and 19 (37.3%) in 6E. Nausea were reported in 31 (20.7%) participants: 9 (18%) 
in group 4E, 12 (24.5%) in 5E, and 10 (19.6%) in 6E. Fever were reported in 30 (20%) participants: 3 
(6%) in group 4E, 16 (32.7%) in 5E, and 11 (21.6%) in 6E. 
Most solicited systemic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no ≥ grade 3 solicited systemic 
AEs in group 4E. In group 5E, there were 3 severe malaise and/or fatigue, 3 severe myalgia, 4 severe 
headache, 3 severe nausea, 3 severe chills, 1 severe arthralgia and 3 severe fever. In group 6E, there 
were 1 severe malaise and/or fatigue, 2 severe myalgia, 1 severe headache, 1 severe nausea, 2 
severe chills, 2 severe arthralgia and 1 severe fever. No Grade 4 events were reported. 
5.9.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In Group 4E, 18 participants (36%) reported 32 unsolicited AEs (all grade 1). In group 5E, 15 participants 
(30.6%) reported 29 unsolicited AEs (22 grade 1, 4 grade 2, 2 grade 3 and 1 grade 4). In Group 6E, 20 
participants (39.2%) reported 38 AEs (31 grade 1, 5 grade 2 and 2 grade 3). 
A total of 18 (12.0%) participants reported 1 or more unsolicited AEs related to study vaccination, most 
of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The number (and percentage) of participants reporting unsolicited 
AEs, of any severity grade, that were deemed related to the study product was 3/50 (6.0%) in Group 
4E  (contusion,  back  pain,  and  dizziness),  7/49  (14.3%)  in  Group  5E  (lymphadenopathy,  diarrhoea, 
vomiting,  axillary  pain,  fatigue,  feeling  abnormal,  swelling,  memory  impairment,  migraine,  insomnia, 
stress  oropharyngeal  pain)  and  8/51  (15.7%)  in  Group  6E  (lymphadenopathy,  2  feeling  abnormal, 
injection site bruising, injection site reaction, gout, 2 dizziness, 2 insomnia, oropharyngeal pain). 
For 3 (2.0%) participants (2 in Group 5E and 1 in Group 6E), 4 related AEs of Grade 3 were reported 
(vomiting, fatigue/feeling abnormal, and insomnia). No related Grade 4 events were reported. 
No deaths were reported. In group 5E, 1 SAE of Grade 4 acute cholecystitis was reported on Day 25 
(Atmar 2021). The event was considered not related to the study vaccine and was reported as resolved. 
In the same group, 1 Grade 3 event of vomiting was considered related to Ad26.COV2.S. The event was 
not reported as an SAE and resolved after 2 days. 
5.9.2.4.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
No AE leading to early termination of the study and no discontinuations have been reported in either 
group. 
5.9.2.5.  AESIs 
In group 5E, 1 AESI has been reported: Grade 3 event of vomiting, related to Ad26.COV2.S. The event 
was not reported as an SAE and resolved after 2 days.

5.10.  Discussion 
The main safety data are from the double-blind phase of the phase 3 study COV3009: 8,655 subjects 
were vaccinated with 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp with 2-month interval (FAS); the safety subset 
includes 1,559 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group for dose 2.  
Supportive data: There were also additional data from the early phase studies for participants received 
a  primary  dose  and  a  booster  dose  (second  dose)  of  Ad26.COV2.S  at  the  5×1010  vp  dose  level:  418 
subjects with a 2-month interval across studies COV1001, COV1002, and COV2001; 128 with a 3-
month interval across studies COV1001 and COV2001; 19 with a 6-month interval in study COV1001 
(and  an  estimated  159  participants  with  a  6-month  or  longer  interval  in  study  COV2008  -  dose-level 
blinded data). 
Finally,  across  studies  COV1001  and  COV1002,  235  participants  received  2  doses  of  1×1011  vp 
Ad26.COV2.S  with a 2- or 3-month interval. Furthermore, 74 participants received a primary dose of 
5×1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S followed by 1.25×1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S booster dose (second dose) 6 months 
later in COV2001. 
In the double-blind phase of COV3009, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp or placebo with a 56-day interval. At the data cut-off for this 
analysis (25 June 2021), 71.2% and 28.4% of participants had completed 2 months of follow-up after 
the  first  and  booster  dose  (second  dose)  vaccinations,  respectively.  In  the  FAS,  the  overall  median 
exposure time in the Ad26.COV2.S group was: 71d after the 1st vaccination and 38d after 2nd vaccination. 
In  the  safety  subset  (double-blind  phase),  after  the  1st  dose,  the  median  follow-up  is  72  days  for  all 
subjects (in Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups). After the 2nd dose, the median follow-up is 40 days for 
all subjects (in both groups). 
Summaries  of  solicited  and  unsolicited  AEs  are  based  on  the  Safety  subset:  3,016  subjects  in  the 
Ad26.COV2.S group and 3,052 in the placebo group for dose 1; 1,559 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S 
group and 1,425 participants in the placebo group for dose 2. 
From the day of vaccination until 7 days after each vaccination, the overall frequencies of local solicited 
AEs were similar post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 (mainly driven by vaccination site pain), and lower in older 
adults (60 years or older) compared to younger adults (18-59 years) (in both Ad26.COV2.S and placebo 
groups). 
From  the  day  of  vaccination  until  7  days  after  each  vaccination,  overall,  the  frequencies  of  systemic 
solicited  AEs  were  slightly  higher  post-dose  1  versus  post-dose  2  (for  the  most  frequently  reported 
solicited systemic AEs: fatigue, headache, and myalgia; and also for nausea and pyrexia), and lower in 
older  adults  (60  years  or  older)  compared  to  younger  adults  (18-59  years)  (in  both  groups).  In  the 
Ad26.COV2.S group, in younger adults, the frequencies of systemic solicited AEs were higher post-dose 
1  versus  post-dose  2;  while  these  frequencies  were  similar  post-dose  1  versus  post-dose  2  in  older 
adults. 
From the day of vaccination until 28 days after each vaccination, the frequencies for unsolicited AEs (all 
and those considered related) were slightly higher post-dose 1 versus post-dose 2 (in both Ad26.COV2.S 
and placebo groups). The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs that were not recorded as solicited 
AEs were chills and arthralgia (both recognized ADRs in the SmPC of Ad26.COV2.S). 
In the double-blind phase, overall, both in the active treatment arm and in the placebo arm, less adverse 
events  (solicited  and  unsolicited)  are  reported  after  the  booster  dose  (second  dose).  However, 
underreporting of adverse events post-dose 2 is unlikely as this trend is also observed in other clinical

trials. 
Summaries of deaths, SAEs, MAAEs, and AESIs are based on the FAS (from the day of first vaccination 
until the end of the study): 15,708 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 15,592 in the placebo group at dose 
1;  8,655  subjects  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  and  8,096  in  the  placebo  group  at  dose  2.  During  the 
double-blind phase, 17 fatal AEs were reported: 4 in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 after dose 1 and 2 after 
dose 2; all considered as not related to vaccine) and 13 in the placebo group. 
SAEs  (including  COVID-19  associated  events)  were reported  for 104 participants  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S 
group (0.7%) and 136 participants in the placebo group (0.9%). No increase in the frequency of SAEs 
was  observed  post-booster  dose  (second  dose)  compared  with  post-dose  1  (in  both  groups).  Eleven 
participants  experienced  a  total  of  13  SAEs  that  were  considered  related:  8  participants  in  the 
Ad26.COV2.S (0.1%) and 3 participants in the placebo group (<0.1%). In the Ad26.COV2.S group after 
the  first  dose,  the  related  SAEs  were  pyrexia,  pericarditis,  allergy  to  vaccine,  and  hemoptysis  in  1 
participant  each,  and  injection  site  swelling,  vertigo,  and  myocardial  necrosis  marker  increased  in  1 
participant. Related SAEs after the blinded booster dose were facial paresis, pulmonary embolism, and 
cerebrovascular accident in 1 participant each. 
No increase was observed post-booster dose (second dose) compared with post-dose 1 for MAAEs and 
AEIs (including AESIs thrombotic event and/or thrombocytopenia). 
Finally,  more  participants  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  reported  the  use  of  medication  as  compared  to 
placebo  (20.4%  versus  7.6%).  The  reported  use  of  medication  was  mainly  driven  in  the  context  of 
treatment of solicited symptoms. The use of medication was similar after the booster dose (second dose) 
compared to the first dose in both groups. 
Across studies COV1001, COV1002, and COV2001, overall, with 2, 3 or 6 months interval between 
the 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp, the frequencies of local (mainly driven by vaccination site pain) 
and systemic solicited AEs were similar or slightly higher post-dose 1 compared to post-dose 2. 
The frequency of solicited AEs ≥ grade 3 was very low, and the majority of the solicited systemic AEs 
were considered related to the use of the study vaccine as per investigator assessment. The majority of 
unsolicited AE assessed as related to vaccination are recognized ADR in the SmPC.  
Overall,  the  intake  of  concomitant  medication  was  similar  or  higher  post-dose  1  compared  to  post-
booster dose  (second dose or post-antigen presentation). 
A  trend  towards  an  increase  in  the  frequency  solicited  AEs  (local  and  systemic)  was  observed  with 
increasing vaccine doses (vaccinations with 1.25.1010 vp, 2.5.1010 vp, 5.1010 vp or 1.1011 vp – 2 months 
apart) (post-dose 1 and post-dose 2), together with an increase of the intake of concomitant medication. 
A  trend  towards  a  decrease  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  solicited  AEs  with  increasing  age  of 
participants was observed post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 Ad26.COV2.S administration (18-30 year-of-age 
vs. 31-45 vs. 46-55 vs. ≥65 years). 
The frequency of unsolicited AEs was overall similar or slightly higher after the 1st compared to the 2nd 
dose. 
In the dedicated booster study COV2008, preliminary dose level-blinded safety data are available 
from a total of 370 participants (including 7-day reactogenicity data from 244 participants), who have 
received  an  Ad26.COV2.S  booster  dose  (second  dose)  (5×1010  vp,  2.5×1010  vp,  or  1×1010  vp)  ≥6 
months after primary single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 vp) vaccination (i.e. in COV3001). Dose level-
blinded reactogenicity data are also available from 161 participants (including 7-day reactogenicity data 
from 76 participants) who have received an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose (second dose) (5×1010 vp, 2.5

×1010  vp,  or  1×1010  vp)  ≥6  months  after  primary  (2-dose)  administration  of  Pfizer’s  BNT162b2. 
However, these data are preliminary and not all participants had completed the 28-day post-vaccination 
reporting  period  at  the  time  of  the  data  extraction,  and  these  data  are  subject  to  change  in  further 
analyses. 
Clinical  data  from  DMID  21-0012  study,  cohort  1,  groups  4E,  5E  and  6E  were  also  submitted: 
homologous or heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp at least 12 weeks 
after  primary  vaccination  with  an  approved  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccine  regimen  (2  doses  of  Moderna-
mRNA-1273 or Pfizer/BioNTech-BNT162b2) or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp. Day 29 after booster 
vaccination has been reached by most of them, but none have reached day 91. Because of the limited 
number of subjects in each group (±50), conclusion should not be considered as final. 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  AE  (pain  and/or  tenderness)  was  reported  with  similar 
frequencies  in  each  group.  Erythema/redness  and  induration/swelling  were  reported  slightly  less 
frequently in group 5E (dosed Moderna / boost Janssen) compared to 4E (dosed Janssen/ boost Janssen) 
and 6E (dosed Pfizer/ boost Janssen). 
All  solicited  systemic  AE  were  less  frequently  reported  in  group  4E  (dosed  Janssen/  boost  Janssen) 
compared  to  groups  5E  (dosed  Moderna  /  boost  Janssen)  and  6E  (dosed  Pfizer/  boost  Janssen);  in 
particular chills and fever (but also malaise and/or fatigue, myalgia, headache, arthralgia; and nausea). 
Overall, unsolicited AEs were reported with similar frequencies in the 3 groups; however, in group 4E, 
they  were  all  grade  1  (and  there  were  some  grade  3  and  4  unsolicited  AEs  in  groups  5E  and  6E). 
Moreover,  unsolicited  AEs  related  to  study  vaccination  were  reported  less  frequently  in  group  4E 
compared to groups 5E and 6E. 
Of note, in Munro et al. 2021, participants primed with Pfizer/Pfizer reported more frequent local and 
systemic reactions after receiving Moderna, Curevac, Vaxzevria, and Janssen vaccine as a third dose, 
compared with other vaccines and control. Participants receiving mRNA vaccines or Janssen vaccine after 
Vaxzevria/Vaxzevria also showed increased systemic and local adverse events. (Munro et al. Safety and 
immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) following two doses of ChAdOx1 
nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK (COV-BOOST): a blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 
trial. Lancet December 2021) 
Finally, updated safety clinical data has also been submitted for the main study COV3001 assessed 
for the initial conditional MA after 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp (data cutoff: 9 July 2021, instead 
of initially 22 January 2021). The results from the safety and reactogenicity analyses showed that the 
5×1010 vp dose level of Ad26.COV2.S administered as a 1-dose regimen had an acceptable safety and 
reactogenicity profile with no significant safety issues identified versus the initial assessment at time of 
conditional MA. In general, a lower reactogenicity was observed for the older adults compared with the 
younger adults.  
Risk of TTS 
A recent study demonstrates that chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (ChAdOx1), human adenovirus type 26 
(HAdV-D26), and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5) deployed as vaccination vectors versus SARS-
CoV-2 bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of HIT (heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia) (Baker AT et al. ChAdOx1 interacts with CAR and PF4 with implications for thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Sci Adv. 2021 Dec 3;7(49)).  
For the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, the estimated reporting rate of TTS in the US is 3.3 per million doses

Upon request, the MAH has provided an update of the TTS cases at the DLP of 04 October 2021. A total 
of  78,047  adult  participants  had  been  included  in  the  extended  adult  pooling,  of  which  9,177  have 
received 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp (irrespective of interval between doses; unblinded data). 
Among the 213 participants with at least 1 event in the SMQ Embolic and thrombotic events, 30 events 
in  22  participants  were  identified  as  Qualified  for  Assessment  TTS  events  based  on  platelet  count 
measurements  below  normal  range  or  with  reported  thrombocytopenia  but  unknown  actual  platelet 
levels.  Of  the  30  Qualified  for  Assessment  TTS  events,  21  events  in  15  participants  met  confirmed, 
probable, or possible PRAC requested definition (Table 18). Of these 21 events, 1 event (Ad26.COV2.S; 
COV3001) was reported with a positive anti-PF4 status (confirmed using PRAC requested definition), and 
the outcome was fatal for 2 events (Ad26.COV2.S; COV1002, COV3009) (possible using PRAC requested 
definition). 
Table 18: Clinical Trial Qualified for Assessment TTS Events Categorized by PRAC Requested Causality 
Categories and by Vaccine Received Prior to AE Onset* up to 04 October 2021  
Of the 21 Qualified for Assessment TTS events meeting confirmed, probable, or possible PRAC requested 
definition, 8 were in the Ad26.COV2.S group, 10 in  the Placebo group, and 3 in the cross-vaccinated 
group,  in  which  participants  in  the  initially  randomized  Placebo  group  received  Ad26.COV2.S  at 
unblinding/crossover  or  were  enrolled  into  study  at  open-label  phase  (ie,  received  Ad26.COV2.S).  Of 
these 8 events reported in 7 participants receiving Ad26.COV2.S, the time to onset of symptoms was 
between 21 and 148 days following last vaccination. One participant was SARS-CoV-2 positive. Of the 
10 events reported in 6 participants in the Placebo group, the time to onset was between 12 and 124 
days  following  last  vaccination.  None  of  these  participants  were  SARS-CoV-2  positive.  The  3  events 
reported in 2 participants after cross-vaccination had a time to onset of 90 to 94 days following crossover 
vaccination. None of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive. 
Upon request, details were provided: 
In study COV1002: 1 participant in the Ad26.COV2.S group experienced a TTS 123 days post dose 2 and 
using PRAC criteria, was assessed as possible TTS. 
In study COV3001: In the Ad26.COV2.S group, 8 AEs were reported for 7 participants. Out of those, 1 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021

was assessed as confirmed (post dose 1) and 4 were assessed possible TTS (post dose 1 Ad26.COV2.S). 
In the placebo group, 8 AEs were reported for 6 participants. Out of those, 5 were assessed as possible 
TTS (post dose 1 of placebo). In the open-label cross-over group, 5 AEs were reported for 4 participants. 
Out of those, 3 were assessed as possible TTS (post dose 1 of open-label cross-over vaccination). 
In study COV3009: In the Ad26.COV2.S group, 2 AEs were reported for 2 participants and were assessed 
as possible TTS. Both events occurred during the open-label phase of the study. In the placebo group, 
6 AEs were reported for 3 participants. Out of those, 5 were assessed as possible. No event of TTS has 
been reported for the open-label cross-over vaccination. 
Therefore,  across  all  submitted  clinical  studies,  only  2  events  happened  after  two  vaccinations  with 
Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine,  both  cases  were  assessed  as  “possible  TTS”  according  to  PRAC  definition,  but 
none  of  the  cases  was  considered  as  causally  associated  with  study  vaccination  by  investigator  (in 
particular because of the too long time-to-onset): 
-  One  case  happened  in  study  COV1002  in  Japan.  This  was  a  participant  of  70-79  years  old  that 
reported  an  acute  myocardial  infarction  123  days  after  the  booster  dose  (second  dose)  of 
Ad26.COV2.S  1x1011  vp.  Platelet  count  at  time  of  the  event  was  11.9x104.  AntiPF4  testing  was 
performed  during  the  study  at  sample  collection  timepoints  pre  and  post  vaccination,  results  are 
considered negative. Anti PF4 testing was not performed at the time of the event. The event had a 
fatal outcome.  
- 
The other case was reported in study COV3009: a fatal event of myocardial infarction was reported 
for  1  participant  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  5×1010  vp  group  118  days  post-vaccination  2.  Non  serious 
thrombocytopenia was reported (60-69 year-old subject). 
Currently  the  booster  dose  (second  dose)  of  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  is  approved  only  in  the  US. 
Based on the review of the CDC website on 05 December 2021, an estimated 669,631 doses of COVID-
19 vaccine Janssen have been identified to have been administered as a booster dose (second dose) in 
the US, and 591,878 individuals have received COVID-19 vaccine Janssen for both primary vaccination 
and booster dose (second dose). No cases of TTS after the booster dose (second dose) of the COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen vaccine have been reported in the post-marketing data. 
Finally,  to  specifically  address  the  potential  effect  of  a  booster  dose  (second  dose)  versus  primary 
vaccine, the MAH has provided a comparison of acute phase proteins after the first, second and third 
dose in a non-clinical repeat dose toxicity study, driven by the hypothesis that the level of innate immune 
responses might be a predisposing factor for TTS. Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein appeared as largely 
similar after any dose. 
Based  on  EEA  exposure  data  for  Vaxzevria,  the  estimated  incidence  rate  of  TTS  is  12.8  per  million 
following the first dose and 0.6 per million following the second dose (Article 5(3) Assessment report; 
EMA/530434/2021).  
Ref:https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/use-vaxzevria-prevent-covid-19-article-53-
procedure-final-assessment-report_en.pdf 
Similarly, lower rate is also estimated from international data e.g. in UK 15.2 vs 2.0 per million doses, 
respectively for the first and second doses (MHRA).  
Therefore, although the submitted data are limited with the booster dose (second dose) of COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen, overall data (non-clinical, clinical, post-marketing data in US and Vaxzevria data) do 
not suggest an increase in frequency of TTS after the administration of a booster dose of vaccination 
compared to a single one.

In  conclusion,  the  reactogenicity  of  the  homologous  booster  dose  (second  dose)  of  Ad26.COV2.S 
5×1010 vp (at least after 2-month after the 1st one) is consistent with the reactogenicity reported after 
administration  of  the  first  dose.  No  new  unexpected  safety  concerns  have  been  observed  after  the 
booster dose (second dose). Two possible cases of TTS were observed after a COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
booster  dose  (second  dose)  (1  with  5×1010  vp  dose,  the  other  with  1x1011  vp  dose,  both  fatal, none 
considered as causality associated with study vaccine). However, after the 2nd dose, the submitted data 
are limited in terms of the duration of follow up and number of vaccines included in the studies which 
does not allow any firm conclusions regarding the occurrence of uncommon or very rare AEs/SAEs and 
AEIs/AESIs (<1/10000) after the 2nd dose (such as TTS, GBS and CLS). Moreover, the number of patients 
with vaccination interval > 2 months is extremely low (unblinded data available for only 147 vaccinees 
with 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp). 
Following  the  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  heterologous  booster  (after  an  approved  mRNA  COVID-19 
vaccine regimen: 2 doses Spikevax or Comirnaty), the solicited adverse reaction profile was similar to 
that following a COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen primary vaccination or homologous booster dose. However, 
because of the very limited number of subjects in each group (±50), conclusion should not be considered 
as final.  
The safety profile of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen will continue to be closely monitored.  
6.  Real World Data and Vaccine Effectiveness 
Introduction 
At time of initial conditional MA, vaccine efficacy was 66.9% (Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40) over a 
median  follow-up  time  of  58.0  days  for  the  prevention  of  symptomatic  ‘moderate  to  severe/critical’ 
COVID-19 with an onset beyond Day 14, and 66.1% (Adjusted 95% CI: 55.01; 74.80) over the same 
period with an onset beyond Day 28, in seronegative adults ≥18 years who received one dose of 5x1010 
vp, vaccine. For Severe COVID-19, VE was 76.7% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.0) with an onset beyond 
Day 14 and 85.4% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.9) with an onset beyond Day 28 over a median follow 
up of 58 days, in SARS-COV-2 seronegative subjects. Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 
14  days  after  vaccination  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  vs.  placebo  group,  2  vs.  6  were  hospitalised. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed 82.4% [95% CI: 63.90; 92.38] efficacy in 
people ≥65 years, compared to 64.2% [95% CI: 55.26; 71.61] in participants 18-64 yoa with an onset 
beyond Day 14. For an onset beyond Day 28, VE was 74.0% [95% CI: 34.40; 91.35] and 65.1% [95% 
CI: 52.91; 74.45] in both age groups, respectively. 
Vaccine efficacy analysis was evaluated in different countries: Brazil; South Africa; and the United States. 
Lower vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 was noted in South Africa (52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; 67.44] for 
cases with onset at least 14 days, 64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] for cases with onset at least 28 days 
after vaccination) compared to the other regions. However for severe COVID-19, VE was consistently 
high, including in South Africa with onset at least 14 days after vaccination (73.1% [95% CI: 40.03; 
89.36] compared to 78.0% [95% CI: 33.13; 94.58] in the US and 89.1% [95% CI: 17.0; 98.0] in Brazil). 
When  evaluated  at  least  28  days  after  vaccination,  VE  point  estimates  were  above  81.7%  and 
comparable in all countries. 
Of all sequenced samples, in the United States, 96.4% of strains were identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant 
D614G; in South Africa, 94.5% of strains were identified as the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage); 
in Brazil, 69.4% of strains were identified to be a variant of the P.2 lineage and 30.6% of strains were 
identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant D614G. As there were predominant variants in the USA and South 
Africa, VE in those countries are likely to reflect the efficacy against the respectively circulating variants.

Since the conditional MA in EU and EUA in the US, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been used in national 
vaccination campaigns. In Europe, the vaccine has been distributed to 28 countries starting in calendar 
week 15 of 2021. The vaccine was never used in Finland, Liechtenstein and Sweden.  
At this moment, real-world evidence (RWE) data is available from a Company-sponsored study in the 
US  (VAC31518COV4002),  a  collaborative  study  in  South-Africa  (Sisonke)  and  several  published  RWE 
studies from the US and EU. A Company-sponsored study in the EU (VAC31518COV4004) is also ongoing, 
but no data are currently available. 
COV4002 
COV4002  is  a  company-sponsored  observational  longitudinal  post-authorization  case-control  study  in 
the US to assess effectiveness of a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (5x1010 vp), with onset 14 
days after vaccination, in adults ≥18 years of age. This study is based on open-source medical claims 
data available in the Health Verity database of approximately 2.1 million individuals (422.034 vaccinated; 
1.645.397  matched  unvaccinated).  Interim  results  are  available  up  to  183  days  (approximately  6 
months)  after  vaccination,  with  a  median  follow  up  time  of  129  days  (approximately  4,5  months). 
Participants  vaccinated  with  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  were  matched  to  unvaccinated  participants 
based on the same location (3-digit ZIP), age within 4 years, sex, and general health status captured in 
a  comorbidity  score.  The  co-primary  objectives  of  the  study  are  (1)  to  estimate  the  effectiveness  of 
COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  in  preventing  any  asymptomatic  or  symptomatic  COVID-19  and  (2)  to 
estimate  the  effectiveness  of  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  in  preventing  any  COVID-19  related 
hospitalization (with diagnosis of COVID-19 or a recorded infection within 21 days before admission) 
A limitation of this study is that a significant proportion of individuals in the ‘unvaccinated group’ may in 
fact be vaccinated but not recorded as vaccinated in the database due to the absence of an insurance 
claim.  Vaccine  effectiveness  (VE)  calculations  have  been  corrected  for  this  by  assuming  40%  under-
reporting, calculated based on considering vaccination rates in the US reported by CDC and vaccination 
rates in the Health Verity database. However, the rate of under-reporting is an estimate and remains to 
be interpreted cautiously. 
Corrected VE for any observed COVID-19 is 76% (95% CI:75 - 77) and slightly higher, 81% (95% CI: 
78 - 82), for COVID-19 related hospitalization. Corrected VE is higher in younger individuals (18-64 yoa) 
compared to elderly (≥65 yoa), both for any COVID-19 (<65yoa: 78% (95% CI: 77 - 79); ≥65yoa: 72% 
(95% CI: 70 - 74)) and COVID-19 related hospitalization (<65 yoa: 85% (95% CI: 83-87); ≥65 yoa: 
74% (95% CI: 70-77)). High protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection as observed in this study is 
not in line with most other studies. Immunocompromised individuals have lower VE for observed COVID-
19 (64%; 59 - 68) compared to non-immunocompromised individuals (77%; 95% CI: 76 - 78). Similarly, 
VE for Covid-19 related hospitalization was lower in immunocompromised individuals (67%; 95% CI: 57 
- 74) than in non-immunocompromised individuals (82%; 95% CI: 80 - 83). 
COVID-19 variant sequence data is not available, but a separate analysis of VE was done on data from 
the  4  states  with  a  high  incidence  of  the  Delta  variant  from  June  to  August  2021,  which  are  Florida 
(72%),  Louisiana  (74%),  Arkansas  (91%)  and  Missouri  (96%).  In  these  states,  VE  during  the  Delta 
period was 74% (95% CI: 71-77) for any COVID-19 and 81% (95% CI: 75-86) for COVID-19 related 
hospitalization. During the entire period of the study from March to July, VE in these states was similar, 
respectively,  75%  (95%  CI:  72-78)  and  80%  (95%  CI:  75-85).  These  results  provide  evidence  that 
COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  provides  similar  protection  against  the  Delta  variant  compared  to  other 
circulating variants.  
When evaluating VE over time, starting 14 days after vaccination, data indicates that protection against 
any COVID-19 remains sustained up to 183 days (approximately 6 months), with median follow-up of 
129 days (approximately 4.5 months). For COVID-19 related hospitalization, VE remains sustained until

at 130 days (approximately 4.5 months) after vaccination (These data indicate there is no waning of VE 
during the limited follow-up period in the study. Similar analysis over a longer period will be needed to 
inform on the long-term protection after one dose of the vaccine. 
In addition, VE was analyzed by month from March to August 2021 The data indicates that VE was stable 
during those months, both for COVID-19 and COVID-19 related hospitalization. In the 4 states with high 
incidence of the Delta variant from June to August 2021, there is a trend for a small reduction in VE 
against any COVID-19 in the months July and August, although not significant. For COVID-19 related 
hospitalizations,  VE  remains  similar  as  before  in  these  states  during  the  high  Delta  incidence  period. 
These  data  indicate  that  one  dose  of  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  provides  overall  similar  protection 
against COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant compared to other circulating variants in the US.  
Sisonke study (COV3012) 
The Sisonke study is a collaboration between the National Department of Health, South African Medical 
Research  Council,  Desmond  Tutu  Health  Foundation,  CAPRISA  and  Janssen.  In  this  open-label 
implementation  study,  477,234  Health  Care  workers  in  South  Africa  ≥18  years  of  age  have  been 
vaccinated with one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen between February and May 2021. This period of 
the  pandemic  was  first  dominated  by  the  Beta  variant  and  then  followed  by  the  Delta  variant.  The 
objective of this study was to determine VE against hospitalization, ICU admission and death ascertained 
28 days or more post vaccination, assessed up to 17 July 2021. Nested sub-cohorts (A and B) from 2 
national  medical  scheme  administrators  /  managed  care  organizations  comparing  unvaccinated 
population  counterparts  matched  for  COVID-19  risk,  were  evaluated  to  assess  VE  using  a  matched 
retrospective cohort design. To validate VE, comparison of HCWs with matched unvaccinated HCWs in a 
nested sub-cohort using a provincial health service data system was also performed. 
VE derived from the A and B datasets comprising 215,813 HCWs was 83% (95% CI 75-89) to prevent 
COVID-19  deaths,  75%  (95%  CI  69-82)  to  prevent  hospital  admissions requiring  critical  or  intensive 
care, and 67% (95% CI 62-71) to prevent COVID-19 related hospitalizations. This data confirms higher 
effectiveness for more serious outcomes. The MAH concludes also that VE was maintained in older HCWs 
and those with comorbidities including HIV infection, although no data was provided. The age distribution 
of participants in the trial is not provided, but as the healthcare force in South Africa are predominantly 
middle aged females, males and elderly are expected to be underrepresented in this study.  
VE remained consistent throughout the Beta and the Delta dominant phases of the study. However, low 
number of events occurred during the Beta period, while the majority of cases occurred during the Delta 
period. VE estimates may thus be considered indicative for protection against the Delta variant. Based 
on  these  data,  one  dose  of  the  COVID-19  Janssen  vaccine  shows  to  be  protective  against  the  Delta 
variant and overall to be in line with efficacy in the pivotal trial. 
The follow-up period after vaccination is limited and longer term data are needed to evaluate if VE is 
sustained over time.  
Real-world effectiveness publications 
Real-world effectiveness (RWE) studies investigating VE of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen to prevent COVID-
19, COVID-19 related hospitalization, ICU admission or death have been published recently. Studies are 
diverse  as  different  study-designs  are  used  and  data  emerges  from  different  geographical  regions; 
different populations; in the presence of multiple variants; and administration of vaccines according to 
local  vaccination  policies.  Some  studies  are  only  assessing  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen,  while  other 
studies compare VE between all authorized vaccines.

The majority of RWE studies published to date for COVID-19 vaccine Janssen have been conducted in 
the US and there is one EU study (The Netherlands). All data was obtained in the period from January 
to August 2021, when the Alpha and Delta variant were the predominant variants circulating.  
VE against any COVID-19 was described by Corchado-Garcia et al., Sharma at al. and Cohn at al. Several 
other  studies  assessed  VE  against  more  severe  COVID-19  (including  Severe  COVID-19,  COVID-19 
related  hospitalization,  COVID-19  related  ICU  admission  and  COVID-19  related  death).  Part  of  these 
analyses were performed before the Delta variant became dominant (Moline et al., Thompson et al., and 
Self et al.), while two studies in the US (Grannis et al. and Cohn et al.) and one in the Netherlands (De 
Gier et al.) report VE during the Delta period. 
Corchado-Garcia et al. performed a multi-state study in the US (majority of participants form Minnesota 
and Wisconsin). Health records were retrieved from the Mayo Clinic Health System. More than 90% of 
population  is  Caucasian  and  approximately  54%  are  female.  In  this  retrospective  case-control  study 
2.195 vaccinated and 21.950 unvaccinated matched control individuals ≥18 years of age who underwent 
PCR testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were included between 27 February and 14 April 2021. 
The follow-up period after vaccination was very limited (maximum 48 days; median not provided). VE 
in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least 14 days after vaccination was 76.7% (96% CI: 
30.3% - 95.3%). Confidence intervals are large due to a small number of PCR positive cases (3 out of 
1.779  in  vaccinated  group;  128  out  of  17.744  in  control  group).  There  were  insufficient  numbers  of 
COVID-19 related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths to assess the effect 
of vaccination on COVID-19 severity. The circulating variants in the concerned states during the study-
period are not discussed, but during this period, the Alpha variant was dominant.  
Sharma at al. performed a retrospective cohort-study of vaccine breakthrough infections in vaccinated 
adults ≥18 years of age from the US Veterans Health Administration database from 01 January through 
31 August 2021. During this period, the Alpha and Delta variant were mainly circulating. The majority 
of  the  population  are  elderly  males  (median  age:  70  years  (interquartile  range:  58-76  years))  and 
227.570 individuals were vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. The objective of this study was to 
determine the frequency of breakthrough infections with an onset at least 14 days after full vaccination 
with any of the available vaccines (COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, Comirnaty or Spikevax). However, no VE 
data  for  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen  is  provided,  only  data  on  the  comparison  of  breakthrough  cases 
between  different  the  different  vaccines.  These  analyses  show  that  compared  to  COVID-19  vaccine 
Janssen, vaccination with Comirnaty or Spikevax results in lower occurrence of documented SARS-CoV-
2 infection up to 200 days after full vaccination (aHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.51-0.58; aHR 0.36; 95% CI 0.33-
0.38; respectively). Similarly, effectiveness against COVID-19 related hospitalization was also lower for 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen compared to mRNA vaccines (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66; aHR 0.30; 0.25-
0.35; respectively). The authors conclude there is a strong relationship between the proportion of the 
Delta variant and occurrence of breakthrough infections. 
The  COVID-19  Associated  Hospitalization  Surveillance  Network  (COVID-NET)  reported  on  the 
effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years in 13 US 
states from 1 February to 30 April 2021, which is during the Alpha dominant period (Moline 2021). Of 
note, the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen was only used since 15 March 2021 and therefore, the follow-up 
period is very short. COVID-19 vaccination status was collected from State Immunization Information 
Systems (IIS). Poisson regression analysis was used to compare COVID-19 case counts (hospitalizations) 
by vaccination status. The proportion of hospitalization in the population vaccinated was compared to 
the unvaccinated population. Potential confounders were accounted for but the analysis did not adjust 
for all confounders such as chronic underlying conditions. In total 7.280 cases were included, of which 
only 394 were fully vaccinated (at least 14 days since last vaccination) with one of the available COVID-
19 vaccines. The sample size of fully vaccinated individuals with the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen was very

limited (16 of 65-74 yoa; 8 ≥75 yoa). VE of this vaccine to prevent COVID-19 associated hospitalizations 
was similar in both age groups; 84% (95%CI: 64 - 93) for adults aged 65-74 years and 85% (95% CI: 
72- 92) for adults aged ≥75 years.  
Thompson et al. assessed VE of all available COVID-19 vaccines in ambulatory and inpatient care settings 
in adults of ≥ 50 years of age by a test negative case-control study. Data was generated through the 
VISION Network which is a collaboration between the Center for Disease Control and 7 United States 
Healthcare systems and research centers. VE with onset at least 14 days after vaccination was assessed 
for all available COVID-19 vaccines against hospitalization and ICU admission between 01 January and 
22 June 2021, when the Alpha-variant was predominantly circulating. For COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, 
VE  is  68%  (95%  CI:  50  -  79)  against  laboratory  confirmed  SARS-COV-2  infection  leading  to 
hospitalization and 73% (95% CI: 59 - 82) against infection leading to an emergency department or 
urgent care clinic visit, represented by 707 and 456 vaccinated individuals, respectively. With a median 
of 42 to 53 days from full vaccination to index date (similar for all COVID-19 vaccines in the study), the 
follow-up after vaccination is relatively short.  
Self  et  al.  published  a  prospective  case-control  study  to  determine  VE  in  preventing  COVID-19 
hospitalizations with onset at least 14 days after full vaccination in adults ≥ 18 years old (median age: 
61  years  (57-77))  without  immunocompromising  conditions  in  the  US.  The  analysis  used  data  of  21 
hospitals within the Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely III (IVY) Network between 11 March and 
15 August 2021, covering the Alpha and Delta dominant period. VE of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen for 
prevention of COVID-19 related hospitalization was 71% (95% CI: 56 - 81). The number of participants 
vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen was limited (n=113) in this study, resulting in large CI. In 
addition, due to the limited sample size, VE could not be stratified by time. 
The VISION network (Grannis et al.) investigated VE in adults against COVID-19 associated emergency 
department or urgent care clinic encounters and hospitalizations with onset at least 14 days after full 
vaccination within 9 US states from June through August 2021 in adults ≥ 18 year of age by using a test 
negative case-control design. As during the study period the Delta variant was predominantly circulating 
(>50% of sequenced isolates), the data gives some indication for VE against this variant. VE of COVID-
19 vaccine Janssen for prevention of COVID-19 related hospitalization was 60% (95% CI: 31-77) and 
65% (95% CI: 56 – 72) against ICU admission. The number of participants fully vaccinated with COVID-
19 vaccine Janssen was limited (n=458) in this study, resulting in large CI. The median interval from 
vaccination to the hospital or ICU admission was 94 days. No VE analysis stratified by time was done. 
A study of COVID-19 VE against hospitalizations and ICU admission in the Netherlands was carried out 
from 04 April through 29 August 2021 using data from the national COVID-19 vaccination register (CIMS) 
and the national register of COVID-19 hospitalizations (NICE) (de Gier et al.). During the study, there 
was an Alpha predominant (95% prevalence; 04 April to 29 May 2021) and a Delta predominant period 
(99.9% prevalence; 4 July to 29 August 2021). All subjects vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
were below 70 years old as for the elderly other vaccines were used. The objectives are to estimate VE 
against COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU admissions per period (Alpha and Delta), per vaccine and per 
time since vaccination. However, as there was only a small number of fully vaccinated hospitalizations 
during the Alpha period, VE by vaccine type has only been calculated for the Delta period. During this 
period, VE against COVID-19 related hospitalization was 91% (95% CI: 88-94) and VE against COVID-
19 related ICU admission was 94% (95% CI: 88 - 98), when considering onset at least 28 days after 
vaccination.  VE  was  similar  in  all  age  groups  and  no  waning  was  observed  up  to  20  weeks  after 
vaccination, overall for all available COVID-19 vaccines.  
Cohn et al. assessed VE against COVID-19 infection and death in US Veterans. This study was published 
after the submission of RWE data by the MAH and was therefore not included in the Real-world evidence 
summary  report  of  06  October  2021.  A  test-negative  case  control  study  was  performed  on  data  of

780,225 veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration database, of which 35,662 were vaccinated 
with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. The same database was used in the study of Sharma at al. (discussed 
above). The analysis was performed on data retrieved in the period from 1 February 2021 to 1 October 
2021, covering the Delta-predominant period starting in July 2021. The majority of the population in this 
analysis are males (89%) with an age >50 (25% of <50 yoa; 38% of 50-64 yoa; 36% of ≥65 yoa) and 
white (70%). Most Veterans vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen received the vaccine between 
March and June. The objective of the study was to assess VE against COVID-19 infection or COVID-19 
related death with onset at least 15 days after vaccination. VE estimates were adjusted for age, race, 
ethnicity,  sex,  and  comorbidity  score.  During  the  study  period,  VE  against  infection  declined  for  all 
vaccine  types,  with  the  greatest  decline  for  COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen.  In  March,  VE  for  COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen was 86.4% (95% CI: 85.2% - 87.6%), while by September, VE was declined to 13.1% 
(95% CI: 9.2% - 16.8%). The authors describe that this was similar across age groups and time since 
vaccination. In contrast to VE against infection, VE against death was overall better sustained during the 
delta period, especially in younger individuals < 65 years old showing VE of 81.5% (95% CI: 70.7% - 
88.4%) while in individuals ≥ 65 years VE was 52.2% (95% CI: 37.2% - 63.6%). To conclude, these 
results indicate that COVID-19 vaccine Janssen proves less protection against infection during the Delta 
period. In this period, vaccination still provides protection against COVID-19 related death, although, 
especially in elderly the benefit is reduced.  
Limitations 
RWE data should be interpretated with caution as there are several limitations and potential biases 
that could have an important impact on the results.  
First of all, different study designs and methodologies each have their own strengths and limitations 
for estimating VE. Also the databases that are used as source of vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 
infection status can introduce bias, as there is a risk of misclassification or under-recording of 
vaccinations, as well as SARS-CoV-2 infections, due to several reasons (including health care claims 
data where reimbursement is not collected through insurance claims in the US; privacy-related issues). 
In some studies, VE estimates have been corrected for expected under-recording, however as the 
exact misclassification rate is difficult to predict precisely, the impact on the results remains uncertain 
and may lead to bias.  
Furthermore, differences between study populations, including underlying comorbidities and other risk 
factors; age; demographics; and socioeconomic factors, make it also difficult to directly compare point 
estimates for VE across studies.  
Methodological differences in case definitions used in different studies could impact VE estimates and is 
a limitation to make comparisons between studies. 
Besides limitations inherent to RWE studies, a limitation of the currently available RWE data for the 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen is the short follow-up period and in addition, the lack of analyses stratified 
for different follow-up periods after vaccination. As a consequence, currently available data is 
insufficient to make any conclusions on potential waning of effectiveness over time against COVID-19, 
COVID-19 related hospitalization or COVID-19 related ICU admission.  
In addition, the appearance of new variants will be a remaining challenge to deal with when analyzing 
long-term data as in many cases, the effect of waning and appearance of variants are difficult to 
disentangle form each other. As sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 variants are usually lacking in RWE 
studies, an indication of VE against a specific variant can only be estimated when a variant is known to 
be predominant at a certain time and location.  
Most studies assessed VE against COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccination, while in 
some studies a period of 28 days was considered. Although analysis of the pivotal trial at time of 
marketing authorization suggested that the onset of protection is around Day 14 post-vaccination, it 
was also shown that onset of protection occurred later, around Day 28, in South Africa. It was 
hypothesized that immune responses of higher magnitude are needed for protection against the main 
variant circulating at that time in South Africa (20H/501Y.V2 variant). This should be taken into 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
Page 135/151 
 
 
 
consideration when interpreting data of VE against the Delta variant, as a similar hypothesis could 
apply as well. 
Of note, many of the available publications are pre-prints and not yet peer-reviewed, which should 
therefore be interpreted with caution.  
Finally, a limitation of all real-world effectiveness studies that are published is the limited use of the 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen in EU and the US compared to the mRNA vaccines, resulting in relatively 
small sample sizes. In addition, the later rollout compared to the mRNA vaccines has as implication 
that many elderly were already vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine. The company-sponsored study in 
the US (VAC31518COV4002) and the collaborative study (Sisonke) in South-Africa are therefore 
considered most relevant and informative. The company-sponsored European study 
(VAC31518COV4004) is expected to provide relevant data on RWE in EU.  
Conclusion 
Available post-marketing RWE data obtained during the period before the Delta-variant became 
dominant and when the Alpha variant was mainly circulating, indicate that vaccine effectiveness after 
one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen is overall in line with vaccine efficacy in the pivotal trial 
COV3001 at time of conditional MA.  
During the Delta-predominant period, data from several studies (mainly from the US and the NL) 
indicate that vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine Janssen overall results in sustained protection against 
more severe COVID-19 (including hospitalization, ICU admission and death). For any SARS-COV-2 
infection or any symptomatic COVID-19, data are currently inconclusive. While the company-
sponsored study COV4002 in the US shows good protection against any SARS-COV-2 infection, very 
low VE was observed in a study with US Veterans, which is more in line with the trial data. In addition, 
many limitations related to RWE data are certainly contributing to differences between study results, 
which should be considered cautiously.  
Available RWE data, is currently insufficient to conclude about the duration of protection and potential 
waning of effectiveness after one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen as long-term VE data is currently 
lacking. 
The MAH is planning to gather RW evidence on both, homologous and heterologous booster 
effectiveness. The studies VAC31518COV4002 and VAC31518COV4004 are being amended to 
include analysis of effectiveness of additional homologous or heterologous booster vaccination. The 
open-label phase of COV3001 include as objectives to estimate effectiveness of additional homologous 
or heterologous vaccine boosting. A new ongoing study sponsored by the he South African Medical 
Research Council (Sisonke boost) is enrolling Sisonke participants to administer a homologous boost 
of Ad26.COV2.S and assess safety and effectiveness of booster vaccination. Additional collaborative 
studies assessing real-world (heterologous and homologous) boosting vaccine effectiveness are 
currently in discussion with collaborators.

7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  sections  4.2,  4.3,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  are  being  updated  to 
introduce a booster dose (second dose) in individuals aged 18 years and older. The Package Leaflet (PL) 
is updated accordingly. Please refer to Attachment 1.  
8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Requested Variation 
COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  (Ad26.COV2.S)  is  indicated  for  active  immunisation  to  prevent  COVID-19 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approved posology is a single dose 
of 5x1010 vp in 0.5 mL, to be administered intramuscularly.  
In the current variation, the MAH is seeking a posology for homologous booster immunization at least 2 
months after primary vaccination in individuals 18 years of age or older and the use of Ad26.COV2.S for 
heterologous booster immunization following completion of primary vaccination with an approved mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
Need for a booster vaccination 
The available clinical data from study COV3001 indicate that no drop of efficacy against severe COVID-
19 was observed at least up to 6 months following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. Efficacy was maintained 
at 73% (95% CI: 63.9; 80.5), despite the emergence of diverse variants. At the primary analysis, the 
efficacy against severe disease was 77% (95% CI: 54.6; 89.1). There was little variability in terms of 
efficacy across the variants for severe COVID-19 (compared to symptomatic COVID-19), with efficacy 
point  estimates  maintained  over  60%  for  the  variants  for  which  sufficient  data  were  available  (Beta, 
Gamma, Mu). Efficacy was higher for the reference strain (around 90%).  
Efficacy  against  symptomatic  COVID-19  was  poor  over  the  4-6  months  post-vaccination  period.  The 
estimates were 67% (95% CI: 59.0; 73.4) and 56% (95% CI: 51.3; 60.8) respectively in the primary 
(median  follow  up  (FU)  2  months)  and  final  (median  FU  4  months)  analyses.  A  drop  of  efficacy  was 
observed rapidly (a few weeks following vaccination), in parallel with the progressive disappearance of 
the reference strain and emergence of several variants. Although it is not possible to firmly disentangle 
the  role  of  waning  of  protective  immunity  from  the  role  of  variants,  the  observed  drop  is  considered 
more likely mainly due to emergence of variants for which there was a decreased efficacy. The efficacy 
point  estimates  are  good  (approx.  70%)  for  the  reference  and  the  Alpha  variant,  as  well  as  for  the 
Zeta/P2  variant  (approx.  65%).  However,  the  efficacy  point  estimate  was  much  lower  for  the  Beta 
(approx.  40%),  the  Gamma/P.1  (approx.  35%)  and  the  Mu  (approx.  35%)  variants.  For  the 
Lambda/C.37, efficacy point estimate was approx. 10%. The limited data for the Delta variant, also point 
to a signal of lack of efficacy (point estimate -6%, based on 11 vs 10 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group 
vs the placebo group). 
Available post-marketing real world evidence (RWE) data obtained during the period while the Alpha 
variant was the mainly one circulating and before the Delta-variant became dominant, indicate that the 
vaccine effectiveness after one dose of Ad26.COV2.S is overall in line with the efficacy data at time of 
initial conditional marketing authorisation (MA). During the Delta-predominant period, several studies 
(mainly from the US and the NL) indicate that protection is sustained against more severe COVID-19 
(including hospitalization, ICU admission and death), while data are inconclusive for any SARS-COV-2 
infection or any symptomatic COVID-19. The data is currently insufficient to conclude about the duration 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
of protection and potential waning of effectiveness after one dose of Ad26.COV2.S as long-term vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) data are currently lacking. 
Neutralizing  and  binding  antibody  (Ab)  levels  evaluated  in  clinical  studies  after  a  single  dose  of 
Ad26.COV2.S appear to be sustained up to at least 6 months. There is no clear decrease of the antibody 
levels  over  time.  A  minor,  and  not  systematic,  trend  for  decreased  Ab  levels is  observed  at  the  later 
timepoints (6 or 8-9 months post-vaccination) when compared to earlier timepoints (1 or 2 months post-
vaccination). This decrease was not considered significant, since 95% confidence intervals (CIs) always 
overlapped. Based on available clinical data, it is not possible to conclude if these observations suggest 
the start of a waning of humoral immune responses or are only due to variability inherent to the limited 
sample.  It  is  not  known  if  the  Ab  levels  will  decrease  or  will  be  maintained  after  6-9  months  post-
vaccination with 1 single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, and if this will impact the clinical protection. Based on 
data of a few subjects, T cell responses appear to be sustained over time. 
Based on very limited data, neutralizing capacity against the Delta and the Beta variants appear to be 
lower compared to the original strain and the Alpha strain.  
Alternative approaches 
Humoral immune responses after a homologous or heterologous boost with an mRNA vaccine, at least 
12 weeks after primary vaccination, are investigated in the Mix-and-Match study (DMID 21-0012) 
conducted by NIH/NIAID (Atmar et al.). While antibody responses increase after both a homologous or 
heterologous boost, the data indicate that the homologous regimen with Ad26.COV2.S induces the lowest 
neutralizing  and  binding  Ab  responses.  Humoral  responses  were  much  higher  14  days  after  boosting 
with an mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax). Due to the limited sample size, differences observed 
are only descriptive. 
Main clinical studies 
Results  supporting  the  use  of  Ad26.COV2.S  for  homologous  booster  immunization  at  least  2  months 
after  primary  vaccination  are  from  five  ongoing  studies,  of  which  3  Phase  1/2  studies  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity and safety of Ad26.COV2.S (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) and 2 large Phase 
3  trials  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  immunogenicity  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  adults  (COV3001  and 
COV3009).  
Immunogenicity and safety data are the key data to support the variation. Results are from four studies 
for immunogenicity (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV3009), while the main safety data are from 
the double-blind phase of study COV3009. 
Study results from the Phase 1/2 study DMID 21-0012, an ongoing heterologous platform boost study 
conducted by NIH/NIAID in the US (published in Atmar et al.) were also included to support the use of 
Ad26.COV2.S for heterologous booster immunization following completion of primary vaccination with 
an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 
Supportive  efficacy  data  are  presented  up  to  the  end  of  the  double-blind  phase  for  COV3001  and 
COV3009. The trials assessed respectively a single- and a 2-dose schedule two months apart vs. placebo. 
Favourable effects 
Immunogenicity 
A booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S, given at 2, 3 or 6 months post-primary vaccination, induces an increase 
in  both  neutralizing  and  binding  Ab  against  the  original  strain  and  variants  of  concern  (VOC),  when 
compared to pre-boost values, both in young and older adults. GMTs increase, ranging from 1.5 to 4.4 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
fold for neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and from 2.5 to 5.8 fold for binding Ab, between pre-boost and 1 
month post-boost. 
Functional Ab against the original strain with a suggested role in viral clearance in vivo tend to increase 
post-dose 2. 
A heterologous boost by Ad26.COV2.S induces an increase in both neutralizing and binding Ab against 
the original strain and the Delta variant (binding Ab), when compared to pre-boost values in subjects 
vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine approximately 3 months before. 
Efficacy 
The  clinical  trial  COV3001  assessed  a  single  dose  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  multiple  countries  (US,  several 
countries in Latin America, South Africa). There was a high diversity of variants amongst cases, without 
a dominant variant. Efficacy against moderate/severe COVID-19 (onset >14 days after vaccination) was 
67% (95% CI: 59.0; 73.4) and 56% (95% CI: 51.3; 60.8) respectively over a 2 months and a 4 months 
median FU period. Efficacy against the Alpha variant was 70% (95% CI: 35.1; 87.6) over a 4 months 
FU period. 
The  clinical  trial  COV3009  assessed  a  2-dose  schedule  given  56  days  apart  vs  placebo  in  multiple 
countries (US, several countries in Europe and in Latin America, South Africa, Philippines). Alpha and Mu 
were the two dominant variants. Efficacy of two doses of Ad26.COV2.S administered two months apart 
was 75% (95% CI: 54.6; 87.3) against moderate/severe COVID-19 (onset >14 days post-dose 2) over 
a median FU period of 36 days. Efficacy against the Alpha variant was 94% (95% CI: 62.9; 99.9). 
Comparison  of  data  across  clinical  trials  suggests  that  a  booster  dose  (second  dose)  administered  2 
months after the first might provide additional protection against symptomatic COVID-19 including for 
variants, but do not suggest a major added value.  
Uncertainties and limitations related to favourable effects 
There are a number of uncertainities and limitations related to immunogenicity and efficacy which are 
briefly listed here:  
Immunogenicity 
• 
• 
There are no results from a dedicated booster study. The study COV2008, which evaluates the 
immunogenicity,  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  Ad26.COV2.S  administered  as  a  booster,  is 
ongoing. 
The  humoral  immune  responses  elicited  by  a  booster  dose  was  only  investigated  before 
immunogenicity started to wane. 
•  Results are from different studies, always with limited sample size, in particular for nAb. 
•  Most of the results are for the original Victoria strain. Limited data are available for the VOC. 
There are no Ab data for the Delta variant when the booster dose (second dose) is given at 2 
months  post-dose  1.  Only  limited  data  are  available  when  the  booster  dose  (second  dose)  is 
given with a 6 month-interval and several limitations have to be considered. First of all, data is 
generated  by  a  developed  (non-qualified)  psVNA  that  seems  to  lack  sensitivity.  In  addition, 
immune responses for these subjects do not follow the same kinetics up to 6 months post-dose 
1 compared to other studies.  
• 
nAb levels observed 1 month post-boost for the variants are lower than for the parental strain. 
•  A post-hoc non-inferiority analysis was performed on 17 subjects that received a boost 6 months 
after the primary vaccination. Since pre-boost Ab levels were not declined compared to 1 month 
post-dose 1, this analysis is not considered relevant. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Data over a FU period of more than 1 month post-dose 2 are limited. A 2-fold decline of Ab titers 
is observed at 4-6 months post-dose 2 when the booster is given with a 2 or 3 month interval, 
while there is no decline in Ab titers post-dose 1. Whether Ab titers will continue to decline over 
time is not known. There are no long-term data when a boost is given 6 months post-dose 1.  
•  COV2001  is  the  only  study  that  allows  comparison  of  different  time-interval  (2  vs  3  months) 
between groups of the same age range. Data for the boost at 6 months post-primary vaccination 
are limited. Overall, data are too limited to conclude on the optimal time interval between doses. 
•  CMI data are very limited and from 1 study only. 
• 
The potential impact of vaccine-induced anti-Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity remains unclear 
and should be further documented. This can have its importance if regular boosters are needed. 
•  Data of study DMID 21-0012 indicate the homologous regimen with Ad26.COV2.S induces the 
lowest  Ab  response,  compared  to  heterologous  boosting  with  an  mRNA  vaccine  and  to  a 
homologous mRNA regimen.  
•  Results of study DMID 21-0012 also suggest that heterologous boosting with Ad26.COV2.S after 
primary  vaccination  with  an  mRNA  vaccine  induces  lower  Ab  levels  compared  to  homologous 
boosting with an mRNA vaccine after 14-days while after 1 month, neutralizing antibody titers 
are roughly similar between both regimens.  
• 
There are no established immune correlate of protection, although it is recognized that Ab are 
associated with protection. The clinical relevance of these observations is not known. 
Efficacy 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The efficacy of a booster was not studied as none of the trials was designed to assess superiority 
of  the  two-dose  schedule  over  the  single  dose  schedule,  or  to  make  any  direct  comparison 
between a two-dose and a single-dose schedule.  
Efficacy  data  are  available  for  a  single  and  for  2-dose  schedule  with  2  months  interval  from 
separate trials. Based on the available data, it is not possible to make robust conclusions on the 
efficacy of a booster dose. 
The  efficacy  point  estimate  was  numerically  higher  in  COV3009  assessing  a  2-dose  schedule 
compared to the point estimate in trial COV3001 assessing a single dose, but CIs widely overlap.  
There are limited data by SARS-CoV-2 variants for the two-dose schedule. The efficacy estimate 
against the Alpha variant is higher in COV3009 compared to the estimate in COV3001, but with 
widely  overlapping  CIs.  Efficacy  was  not  demonstrated  for  the  Mu  variant,  and  could  not  be 
estimated  for  other  variants  in  COV3009,  due  to  insufficient  numbers.  There  are  very  limited 
data on the currently most relevant variant which is the Delta. In addition, spike sequence data 
were  available  for  only  68%  of  the  cases  with  an  imbalance  across  arms,  possibly  leading  to 
biases.  Follow-up  period  varied  across  countries,  variants  distribution  evolved  over  time  and 
differed across countries, which could also lead to biases when estimating efficacy by variants.  
•  Beside the limitations associated with comparing data across trials, several important limitations 
have been identified in trial COV3009. Given the huge discrepancy between the FAS and the PP 
(approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  PP  set),  the  analysis  cannot  be 
considered as resulting from a randomized comparison. Data from this trial raises some concern 
with respect to awareness of treatment allocation. 
• 
The very short time of FU (36 days post-dose 2) also considerably limits the interpretation of the 
results of study COV3009. 
There are very limited data on severe cases and in elderly for the two dose schedule. 
• 
•  All these issues raise concern on the robustness of the findings of COV3009, especially for the 
variants. 
• 
Efficacy  is  lacking  for  asymptomatic  cases,  either  after  a  single  dose  or  after  two  doses  of 
Ad26.COV2.S. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unfavourable effects 
The main safety data are from the double-blind phase of the phase 3 study COV3009: 8,655 subjects 
were vaccinated with 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp with 56-day interval (FAS); the safety subset 
includes  1,559  participants  in  the  Ad26.COV2.S  group  for  dose  2.  In  the  FAS,  the  overall  median 
exposure time in the Ad26.COV2.S group was: 71d after the 1st vaccination and 38d after 2nd vaccination. 
Although  limited,  overall,  the  clinical  data  indicate  that  the  reactogenicity  of  a  second  5×1010  vp 
Ad26.COV2.S  dose  after  2  months  is  consistent  with  the  reactogenicity  observed  after  the  first 
Ad26.COV2.S dose. Across all groups of participants who received 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 
vp or 1×1011 dose level with a 2- or 3-month interval, and for participants who received a primary dose 
of  5×1010  vp  followed  by  antigen  presentation  with  1.25×1010  vp  6  months  later,  the  reactogenicity 
profile is reassuring with similar or decreased reactogenicity after the 2nd dose compared to the 1st. A 
trend towards a decrease in the frequency and severity of solicited AEs with increasing age of participants 
was observed post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 Ad26.COV2.S administration (18-30 year-of-age vs. 31-45 
vs. 46-55 vs. ≥65 years; or 18-59 vs. >60 years). 
No new unexpected safety concerns have been observed after the 2nd dose. Two possible cases of TTS 
were observed after a Ad26.COV2.S booster dose (1 with 5×1010 vp dose, the other with 1x1011 vp dose, 
both  fatal,  none  considered  as  causality  associated  with  study  vaccine).  Overall,  data  (non-clinical, 
clinical, post-marketing data in US and Vaxzevria data) do not suggest an increase in frequency of TTS 
after the administration of a booster dose of vaccination compared to a single dose.  
In study DMID 21-0012, following the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen heterologous booster (vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp at least 12 weeks after primary vaccination with an approved mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine  regimen:  Cominarty  or  Spikevax),  the  solicited  adverse  reaction  profile  was  similar  to  that 
following  a  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  primary  vaccination  or  homologous  booster  dose  (with 
Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp). 
Uncertainties and limitations related to unfavourable effects 
For the homologous booster (2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen), the submitted data are limited in 
terms of the duration of follow up and number of participants included in the studies which does not 
allow any firm conclusions regarding the occurrence of uncommon or very rare AEs/SAEs and 
AEIs/AESIs (<1/10000) after the 2nd dose (such as TTS, GBS and CLS). Moreover, the number of 
patients with a vaccination interval longer than 2 months is extremely low since unblinded data is 
available for only 147 vaccinees with 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5×1010 vp. 
With regards to te heterologous booster, the conclusion should not be considered final because of the 
very limited number of participants in each study group (±50 participants). 
Therefore,  given  these  uncertainties,  appropriate  routine  risk  minimization  measures  have  been 
proposed in the product information.  
Finally, additional safety data will be collected after the booster dose in the remit of the ongoing 
studies COV2008, COV3009 and DMID 21-0012. 
Overall conclusion 
At the moment, the need for booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S cannot be justified in terms of 
restoring immune response, given that following a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, there is no clear 
evidence of waning of immunity up to 8-9 months. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 after a single 
dose of Ad26.COV2.S is sustained at a good level over a 6 months period for the reference strain and 
variants, which is supported by real-world effectiveness data. Nevertheless, lower neutralizing capacity 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/695763/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
against some VOCs has been shown compared to the reference strain. Consistently, very low or lacking 
efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 caused by certain variants is observed. This implies that a 
booster dose can be justified in terms of restoring protection that has been lost because of variants. 
There is a need to better protect individuals who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S.  
Immunogenicity data show an increase in the humoral responses, including for variants, when a 
booster dose is administered 2, 3 or 6 months after the first dose. For the parental strain, the GMTs 
increases observed between pre-boost and 1 month post-boost range from 1.5 to 4.4 fold for nAb and 
from 2.5 to 5.8 fold for binding Ab. The data for the variants are very limited and, most of them, 
generated by using non-qualified assays. For the Delta variant, only limited data is available when the 
booster is administered with an interval of 6 months, while there is no data with a 2- or 3- month 
interval. Most of the data are available only for a short FU period post-dose 2 (i.e. 1 month). There are 
currently no data from a dedicated booster study. Although it is recognized that Ab levels are 
associated with protection, in the absence of an established immune correlate of protection, the clinical 
relevance of these observation is not known. CMI data are limited and do not suggest an increase in 
the CD4 and CD8 Th1 responses with a booster dose.  
Overall, the available efficacy data at this stage are not sufficient to confirm that efficacy is increased 
with a booster dose. Evidence across the phase 3 trials suggest that a booster dose (second dose) 
administered at 2 months might increase the level of efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, 
including for variants. Data suggest that the increment could be limited. However, due to several 
sources of uncertainty, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the clinical added value (and magnitude of) 
a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S. No data are available for the Delta variant.  
Based on the overall evidence (immunogenicity and efficacy), a benefit of administering a homologous 
booster dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine after at least 2 months can reasonably be assumed, but 
this benefit is probably limited. 
Current evidence suggest that an heterologous boosting with Ad26.COV2.S after primary vaccination 
with an mRNA vaccine induces lower Ab levels compared to homologous boosting with an mRNA 
vaccine after 14-days, while after 1 month, neutralizing antibody titers are roughly similar between 
both regimens. Data indicate the homologous regimen with Ad26.COV2.S induces the lowest Ab 
response compared to heterologous boosting with an mRNA vaccine and to a homologous mRNA 
regimen. 
To conclude, there are many uncertainties on the benefit of administering a booster dose with 
Ad26.COV2.S after at least 2 months. A certain benefit can reasonably be assumed after a homologous 
boost with Ad26.COV2.S, but this benefit might be limited and is very likely lower than with mRNA 
heterologous boosting. For the Delta variant, there were no data after a booster given at 2 months 
post-dose 1, whereas limited data indicate an increase of nAb post-boost when given at 6 months 
post-dose 1. For heterologous boosting with Ad26.COV2.S after primary vaccination with an mRNA 
vaccine, the level of nAb at 1 month post-boost is in the same range than after homologous mRNA 
boosting. The risk of TTS events associated with a booster of Ad26.COV2.S remains unknown.  
Although there are many uncertainties and limitations, the benefit risk of booster vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S can be considered positive as reflected in the updated SmPC.  
The benefit-risk balance of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, remains positive.

10. A literature review of immunogenicity data post-homologous or heterologous boost with 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen or the mRNA vaccines should be submitted regulalry. The first 
review is expected with the submission of study COV2008. 
Clinical efficacy aspects 
11. For study COV3001: Additional analyses of incidence rates of / effectiveness against 
moderate/severe and severe COVID-19 cases accrued during the Delta variant period are 
planned (double-blind and open-label phases) and should be submitted as soon as available. 
The format of submission should be discussed with EMA to make sure these data will be 
submitted as rapidly as possible, given the relevance for the public health. 
12. For study COV3001: Efficacy/incidence analyses by variant (double-blind and open-label 
phase) are planned based on updated genomic sequencing, and should be submitted as soon 
as available. The format of submission should be discussed with EMA to make sure these data 
will be submitted as rapidly as possible, given relevance for the public health. 
13. For study COV3009: Additional analyses of incidence rates of / effectiveness against 
moderate/severe and severe COVID-19 cases accrued during the Delta variant period are 
planned (double-blind and open-label phases) and should be submitted as soon as available. 
The format of submission should be discussed with EMA to make sure these data will be 
submitted as rapidly as possible, given relevance for the public health. 
14. For study COV3009: Efficacy/incidence analyses by variant (double-blind and open-label 
phase) are planned based on updated genomic sequencing, and should be submitted as soon 
as available. The format of submission should be discussed with EMA to make sure these data 
will be submitted as rapidly as possible, given relevance for the public health. 
15. For COV3001 and COV3009: In further analyses of COV3001 and COV3009, the incidence of 
COVID-19 will be compared across groups during the time period from 01 July 2021 to 21 
September 2021 (covering a period where the Delta variant circulated) (REC11 and REC13). 
Genomic sequencing information will be provided as well to characterize the incidence and 
(relative) efficacy by variant (REC12 and REC14). This will be done separately for each trial. At 
the time of reporting, based on more information on the number of participants/cases, the 
MAH should re-consider pooling both trials data when reporting the efficacy results from these 
additional analyses, including adjusting for covariates. Moreover, at that time, the MAH should 
also update the agency with their plans to assess effectiveness of the single dose schedule, 
effectiveness of the two-dose schedule, and effectiveness of the booster (single vs two-dose 
schedule), by variants (genomic analyses) and over period during which a predominant variant 
circulates, including for pooled analyses over trials.  
16. The MAH should submit the real-world homologous and heterologous booster data of studies 
COV4002, COV4004, and Sisonke boost study. Interim and final results should be submitted.  
17. The MAH should submit regular overviews of all relevant real-world data of studies where 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen has been used as a single dose, as homologous or as heterologous 
booster. The overview should include the literature review of published and unpublished 
reports, and with a special emphasis on effectiveness data against the Delta variant and new 
emerging VoC such as Omicron, and any other relevant VoC that would emerge. The first 
overview is expected in 6 months. 
18. The MAH is asked to do a regular literature review of efficacy and effectiveness data against 
asymptomatic infection and transmission, after a single dose or a booster dose of COVID-19 
Type II variation assessment report

Vaccine Janssen. A summary of the review should be submitted on regular basis. The first 
review is expected in 6 months. 
19. The MAH is asked to do a regular literature review of efficacy and effectiveness data in special 
populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, who received a single or a booster dose of 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. A summary of the review should be submitted on regular basis. The first 
review is expected in 6 months.

Extension of Indication to include a new indication in adults patients with Chronic rhinosinusitis with 
nasal polyposis. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
An updated RMP is submitted (V 4.0) 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
(P/0311/2015) issued on 21 December 2015 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant did seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP in 2016 (EMA/H/SA/2744/2016/II).

The current application seeks approval of dupilumab in severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal 
polyposis (CRSwNP). The proposed dose regimen is 300 mg q2w for dupilumab as an add-on treatment 
in adult patients with severe CRSwNP who are inadequately controlled with intranasal corticosteroids. 
The proposed indication is as follows :  
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) 
Dupixent is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis 
with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) who previously failed or are intolerant or contraindicated to systemic 
corticosteroids and/or surgery. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 7/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dupixent is indicated to reduce the need for surgery and systemic corticosteroid use in adult patients 
with inadequately controlled severe CRSwNP.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Non clinical safety was assessed as part of the original MAA for atopic dermatitis (AD) indication and no 
new pre-clinical toxicology studies are included in this submission. However, an updated amended 
carcinogenicity risk assessment is provided in this application. 
2.2.2.  Toxicology  
Carcinogenicity 
The document Amended Carcinogenicity Risk Assessment is an amended risk assessment to those 
previously submitted to Health Authorities. The purpose of this amendment was to reflect an updated 
literature search cut-off date in support of  the marketing authorisation applicationfor the patients with 
chronic  rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis..  
A literature search for any articles published between June 1, 2018 and January 31, 2019 was 
performed, and no new publications were identified that would change the conclusions of the original 
document. No changes have been made to the original document. 
The conclusion stated in the original application remains the same. 
In summary, the weight-of-evidence for the available literature data related to IL-4Rα inhibition, and 
animal toxicology data with surrogate antibodies REGN1103 and REGN646, do not support an 
increased risk of cancer for dupilumab. Hence, the MAH maintains that no additional nonclinical studies 
are necessary to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of dupilumab. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
There was no update of the environmental risk assessment. It is considered that with this new 
indication the risk associated with environmental assessment would remain unchanged. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The updated information provided do not change previous conclusion made on carcinogenicity. There is 
no need to update the SmPC.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of duplilumab.  
The available non clinical data support the use of duplilumab in the proposed indication.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The PK profile of dupilumab was characterized in 6 Phase 1 studies conducted in adult healthy 
subjects (including Japanese subjects). The PK results from these Phase 1 clinical pharmacology 
studies in healthy subjects were previously presented in the original dupilumab marketing 
application in support of the adult AD indication. 
The PK and PD profiles of dupilumab were assessed in adult patients with CRSwNP who were 
inadequately controlled with INCS in the Phase 2a study ACT12340 and in patients who had failed 
prior treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery in 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(EFC14146 and EFC14280) for treatment periods ranging from 16 weeks to 52 weeks. A 
subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen of 300 mg once every week (qw), following a loading dose of 
600 mg on Day 1, was assessed in this Phase 2a study. Subsequently, the 300 mg once every 2 
weeks (q2w) regimen without a loading dose was evaluated in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280, 
and the 300 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w) regimen was evaluated following 24 weeks of 300 mg 
q2w treatment in Study EFC14280. All of these studies included an assessment of immunogenicity. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Bioanalytical assays used for the CRSwNP program have been employed previously during the 
bioanalysis of clinical study samples in the AD and asthma submissions. 
Serum samples for quantitation of functional dupilumab (ie, dupilumab with 1 or both binding sites 
available for target IL-4Rα binding) in human serum were analysed using validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of functional dupilumab 
of 0.078 mg/L in undiluted human serum. The functional dupilumab concentration assay (R668-AV-
13074-VA-01V1) used in the CRSwNP phase 2 ACT12340 and the phase 3 (EFC14146 and 
EFC14280) studies was submitted with the original AD application. Incurred sample reanalysis 
(ISR) for the functional dupilumab assay was performed in the ACT12340 study. 
The ADA analysis of the ACT12340 study was conducted using the R668-AV-13089-VA-01V1 assay. 
A 2-assay approach (previously described in the asthma marketing application) using the ADA 
assay and the modified ADA assay was employed for the 2 pivotal CRSwNP phase 3 studies 
(EFC14146 and EFC14280). Assay cut points established for ADA assays were based on statistical 
methods recommended in appropriate guidelines (EMA Guideline, 2009) with the objective of 
demonstrating that the assay is suitable and reliable for the detection of ADA in patient sera. 
The NAb analysis was only performed in the phase 3 studies, using the R668-AV-13112-01V2 
assay which has been described in the asthma marketing application. 
For the CRSwNP indication in adults, the to-be marketed dupilumab drug product is a liquid 
formulation at a concentration of 150 mg/mL, supplied in a 2 mL volume as a prefilled syringe to 
deliver a dose of 300 mg for subcutaneous (SC) administration. This formulation was approved as 
part of the original marketing application for atopic dermatitis (AD). Data demonstrating 
comparability of the approved commercial drug substance (DS) to the DS previously used in clinical 
development program has been submitted in the original marketing application for AD. 
Across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 program in CRSwNP, blood levels of the type 2 inflammation 
biomarkers (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine [TARC], total IgE, eosinophil cationic 
protein [ECP] and periostin) were assessed as markers for disease activity/severity and to gain a 
better mechanistic understanding of dupilumab action. These same markers and eotaxin-3 were 
also assessed from nasal secretions to similarly gain an understanding of dupilumab's actions in the 
sino-nasal cavity. In addition, the dupilumab effect on leukotriene E4 (LTE4) in urine, a stable end 
product of the cysteinyl leukotriene pathway and a marker of activation of mast cells, involved in

type 2 inflammation in patients with CRSwNP and NSAID-ERD, was explored. Concentrations of 
ECP and IgE were measured using quantitative ImmunoCAP assays. Serum TARC and periostin 
were assayed with validated enzyme immunoassays. Blood eosinophil count was measured by 
haematology autoanalyzer. Urine LTE4 was quantified by LC/MS. Eotaxin-3 from nasal secretion 
was assayed with a validated immunoassay. Eotaxin-3 was measured in heparinized plasma with a 
validated enzyme immunoassay. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma share 
many of the same underlying disease mechanisms as all 3 diseases are type 2 inflammation driven, 
with the tissue where this inflammation manifests as a disease differing. In addition, 59% of the 
CRSwNP patients enrolled in the pivotal program had comorbid asthma showing the significant 
overlap of the type 2 diseases. However, in response to the Agency’s RSI, a developmental 
exercise was conducted to demonstrate selectivity of the functional dupilumab PK assay in serum 
samples from CRSwNP patients. The selectivity assessment was performed using baseline serum 
samples (Sa 01 to Sa 10; Table see below) from a dupilumab CRSwNP phase 3 clinical study. 
Samples were analyzed unspiked and spiked with 1.56 ng/mL (0.078 mg/L in neat serum) of 
dupilumab, which is the lower limit of quantification of the assay. No matrix interference was 
observed in the unspiked samples, as all ten samples were below the limit of quantification (BLQ). 
All ten patient samples spiked with 1.56 ng/mL of dupilumab demonstrated acceptable analyte 
recovery (%AR), with values ranging from 84% to 100%. 
Table 2 Selectivity of the functional dupilumab assay in CRSwNP patient samples 
 Pharmacokinetic data and analyses 
Dupilumab concentrations were measured in the target CRSwNP population in one Phase 2 (Study 
ACT12340) and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280) using sparse sampling 
(samples collected at predose, during treatment, and the follow up period). Descriptive statistics 
were used to summarize the concentration data over time in the individual CRSwNP studies. 
Dupilumab concentrations determined in the CRSwNP population were also compared to the 
dupilumab concentrations in the AD and asthma populations as well as in healthy subjects. 
To assess the E-R or PK/PD relationship for key efficacy endpoints in the CRSwNP population, 
descriptive E-R analysis by exposure quartiles for data from the pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 
and EFC14280), as well as model-based PK/PD analyses (Study POH0687) using these pooled 
Phase 3 data were performed.

 - Collection of PK and PD data from the phase 2 and phase 3 studies  
PK and PD data were collected from the phase 2 (ACT12340) and phase 3 studies (EFC14146, 
EFC14280) submitted in this application and are described below separately.  
A) Pharmacokinetic Results (study EFC14146): 
Blood samples for measurements of functional dupilumab concentration were taken at baseline 
(Day 1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24 (EOT), Week 36, and Week 48. Samples for the 
detection of ADA, NAb, and type 2 PD biomarkers (TARC, periostin, IgE) were collected at the time 
points specified. Urine samples were collected for measurement of LTE4. 
In patients receiving dupilumab treatment, pre-dose concentrations were below the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ). Following SC administration of dupilumab 300 mg q2w, the mean serum 
trough dupilumab concentration increased to 31.3 mg/L at Week 4 and Ctrough increased over time 
to Week 24 with mean (SD) Ctrough at 69.2 (36.9) mg/L. Following discontinuation of study 
treatment mean trough concentration decreased to 0.356 mg/L at Week 36. 
Figure 1 Serum concentration (ng/mL) of dupilumab over time - PK population 
Mean trough concentrations of dupilumab increased over time to 69.2 mg/L at Week 24. 
Immunogenicity Results:  
15.4% of dupilumab treated patients showed treatment-emergent ADA responses at at least one 
time point compared to 5.3% of placebo patients. The majority of ADA responses were low titer 
(<1000), with 1 patient in the dupilumab group having a moderate titer response (1000 to 10 
000). One patient, who was in the placebo group received one dose of dupilumab by error, had a 
high titer response (>10 000) and was included in the dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w arm in the 
immunogenicity related analyses. Persistent ADA responses occurred in 3.5% of dupilumab 
patients compared with 1.5% in placebo patients. There was an overlap in the individual exposure 
across patients of different ADA status with that of ADA negative patients.

Figure 2 Percentage of patients with treatment-emergent ADA positive response at each 
visit - ADA population 
The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent ADA positive response by visit ranged from 
2.8% to 3.6% in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 0.8% to 3.1% in the placebo group between 
Weeks 8 and 24. The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent ADA positive response 
increased to 9.5% to 13.7% in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group but remained at 3.2 to 3.3% in 
the placebo group post-treatment period. Samples positive in the ADA assay were further 
characterized for the presence of NAbs. 10.5% of patients in the dupilumab group and 0% in the 
placebo group were positive in the NAb assay. Among the 15 NAb positive patients, a persistent 
ADA response was observed in 4 patients (all in the dupilumab group). Among the NAb positive 
patients, high titer ADA responses were observed in only 1 patient who was administered one dose 
of dupilumab by error. 
Table 3 Summary of ADA incidence - ADA population 
Analyses regarding association between ADAs and adverse events, efficacy and PK  
Patients with treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA responses were grouped and referred 
to as ADA-positive patients. Patients who were ADA negative at all times or had pre-existing 
immunoreactivity were also grouped together and referred to as ADA-negative patients.

A trend of lower mean dupilumab exposure was seen in ADA-positive patients compared to ADA-
negative patients. However, there was substantial overlap in individual dupilumab exposure 
regardless of ADA status. 
Figure 3 Spaghetti plot of Dupilumab concentration over time (on treatment) by ADA 
titer category - PK population 
The individual dupilumab concentrations in ADA-positive patients were generally within the 
exposure range observed in ADA-negative patients, except for one patient with a moderate titer 
ADA response (1000 to 10 000). The dupilumab exposure was lower for this patient with moderate 
titer ADA.  
Figure 4 Serum concentrations of dupilumab over time by ADA and NAb status of 
patients in the dupilumab 300mg q2w group - ADA population 
Possible effects of NAb positivity on dupilumab PK were assessed. In line with the results described 
above, a slight lower mean dupilumab exposures was observed for the treatment-emergent ADA 
response patients with Nab positive status. However, an overlap in individual dupilumab exposure 
regardless of Nab status was seen. 
•  ADA and efficacy 
The relationship between ADA and clinical response measured by change from NPS and NC at week 
24 (co-primary endpoints) was investigated in treatment-emergent ADA positive patients. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019

Of note, the evaluation of the association of a treatment-emergent ADA response with these 
efficacy assessments is based on a small population (N=22 ADA-positive patients for the dupilumab 
group).  
LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 in NPS was -1.11 for the ADA-positive and -2.02 and 
ADA-negative patients. LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 in NC was -1.39 for the ADA- 
positive and -1.33 and ADA-negative patients.

•  ADA and adverse events 
Of note, similar to the evaluation of the association of a treatment-emergent ADA response with 
the efficacy co-primary endpoints, there was only a limited number of patients with an ADA 
response. No apparent imbalance was seen in TEAE incidence in the few ADA-positive patients 
(N=29) compared with the ADA-negative patients (N=246). Of the 29 patients who were ADA-
positive, 21 patients had TEAEs, with no apparent pattern or increase in TEAE incidence in the 
ADA-positive patients compared with the ADA-negative patients. Three ADA-positive patients had 
events that were considered SAEs (uterine polyp, carpal tunnel syndrome, EGPA) and 1 ADA-
positive patient had TEAEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation (accidental overdose 
on Day 40 and ligament sprain on Day 41). For each of these patients, there was no temporal 
relationship between the AE and the ADA positive response. Analysis of the potential impact of NAb 
on TEAEs was also limited by the small number of patients with a positive NAb response. Of the 15 
patients with a NAb response across both treatment groups, 10 patients had at least one TEAE.

EMA/547569/2019

•  Analysis of hypersensitivity reactions and other adverse events of interest by ADA status 
One of 29 ADA-positive patients had an SAE of EGPA (eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis). This SAE occurred at Day 8 and lead to treatment discontinuation. This 61-year-old 
female patient had a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, autoimmune thyroid disease, and 
hypertension and Eosinophilia, that increased to 2.42 Giga/L at Day 1 (prior to 1st and last IMP) 
and was reported as an AE of severe intensity on Day 7 (4.89 Giga/L). The patient was ADA 
negative around the time of the event, and had a low-titer (30) transient treatment-emergent 
response on Day 112.   
•  Analysis of injection site reactions by ADA status 
Of the 29 ADA-positive patients across both treatment groups, no patients in the dupilumab and 1 
patient (14.3%) in the placebo group had an event defined as injection site reaction. Among the 
246 ADA-negative patients 29 were reported with an injection site reaction (10.7% in the 
dupilumab group and 12.8% in the placebo group). However, due to the small numbers of patients 
no meaningful conclusion can be drawn. 
In this patient population the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 15.4% in the dupilumab 
group. The relationship between ADA and clinical response measured by change from NPS and NC 
at week 24 (co-primary endpoints) was evaluated. Only a small difference in NPS and no difference 
in NC results between ADA positive and negative patients. However, this evaluation was based on a 
small number of patients (N=22 ADA-positive patients for the dupilumab group). ADA formation 
did not appear to correlate with any safety findings. Additionally, no difference was seen in number 
of the reported injection side reaction between the dupilumab and placebo treatment group. 
B) Pharmacokinetic Results from EFC14280 
At the time of the data cut-off for the CSR (29 August 2018) PK data for Week 52 were available 
for approximately 70% of patients in the study. Results are described below: 
Functional dupilumab concentrations in serum were measured at baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 2, 4, 
16, 24, 40, 52 (EOT), and 64 (EOS). Pre-dose concentrations were below the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ). Blood samples for measurements of functional dupilumab concentration, 
detection of ADA, and type 2 PD biomarkers (TARC, periostin, IgE) were collected at time points 
specified as well as urine LTE4. 
Following the administration of dupilumab 300 mg q2w, the mean trough dupilumab concentration 
were 22.3 mg/L for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 21.5 mg/L for the 300 mg q2w-q4w groups at 
Week 2.  
In treatment Arm A (300 mg q2w) Ctrough appeared to reach steady state by Week 16 and was 
sustained at the steady-state levels throughout the treatment period. At steady state, the mean 
trough concentration was 74.4 to 80.2 mg/L. Accumulation, as assessed by trough concentration 
following the twelfth dose compared to trough concentration after the first dose, was 3.60-fold at 
300 mg q2w. For the 300 mg q2w−q4w group, the PK profile was similar to 300 q2w group from 
baseline to Week 24. After the switch from the 300 mg q2w to 300 mg q4w dosing regimen at 
Week 24, mean trough concentration decreased from 75.5 mg/L at Week 24 to 17.6 mg/L at Week 
52. The mean trough concentration increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at Week 
52 (4.29-fold [17.6 versus 75.5 mg/L] for a 2-fold dose increase from 300 mg q4w to 300 mg 
q2w).  
More patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group (8.7%) had steady-state concentrations at 
the end of the 52-week treatment that were below the limit of quantitation (0.078 mg/L) than in 
the 300 mg q2w treatment group (1.8%). Some patients may not have reached full saturation of 
the target-mediated elimination at the steady-state exposure of 300 mg q4w.

Figure 7 Serum concentration (ng/ml) of dupilumab over time - PK population 
Immunogenicity Results:  
In the full cumulative analysis, treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 5.4% of 
patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 12.2% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-
q4w group, and 4.0% of the placebo group. The majority of ADA responses were low titer (<1000), 
with 3 patients having a high titer response (>10 000) (2 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group and 1 patient in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group). Persistent ADA responses as 
defined in SAP (5.3.5.1 Study EFC14280 [16-1-9-sap]) occurred in 2.7% (4/148) of patients in the 
300 mg q2w group and 4.1% (6/148) of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group compared with 
0.7% (1/149) observed in the placebo group. 
Table 4 Summary of ADA incidence - ADA population 
The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent ADA by visit ranged from 2.1% to 4.1% in 
the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 3.4% to 5.6% in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 
0.7% to 3.0% in the placebo group between Weeks 8 and 52. 
The differences between treatment groups observed in the proportion of patients with a treatment-
emergent ADA at Week 52 (3.5% and 5.6% for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and q2w-q4w groups, 
respectively, versus 3.0% for the placebo group) were amall. However, the proportion of patients

with a treatment-emergent ADA at Week 64 in the post treatment period was 2.2% and 11.4% for 
the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and q2w-q4w groups, respectively, versus 1.7% for the placebo group. 
Further characterization was performed regarding the presence of Nabs.  
In the full cumulative analysis, the proportion of patients positive in the NAb assay was 3.4% in the 
300 mg q2w group, 11.5% in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 2.0% in the placebo group. Among 
the 25 NAb positive patients, a persistent ADA response was observed in 9 patients, of whom 2 
were in the 300 mg q2w group, 6 were in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 1 was in the placebo 
group. All 3 patients with high titer ADA responses were NAb positive. 
Table 5 Summary of neutralizing antibody (NAb) Status - ADA population 
Analyses of any associations between ADA and adverse events, efficacy, and PK 
Similar to study EFC 14146 patients with treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA responses 
were grouped and referred to as ADA-positive patients. Patients who were ADA negative at all 
times or had pre-existing immunoreactivity were also grouped together and referred to as ADA-
negative patients. 
•  ADA and pharmacokinetics 
A trend of lower mean dupilumab exposure was observed in ADA-positive patients compared to 
that in ADA-negative patients.  
Figure 8 Spaghetti plot of dupilumab concentration over time (on treatment) by ADA 
titer category –PK population 
However, a substantial overlap in individual dupilumab exposure regardless of ADA status was seen 
and individual dupilumab concentrations in ADA-positive patients were generally within the 
exposure range observed in ADA-negative patients, except for 3 patients with high titer ADA

response (>10 000). These patients with high titer ADA had treatment-emergent persistent ADA 
response, were ADA positive and NAb positive from Week 8 throughout Week 52. Significant lower 
dupilumab exposure was observed for these 3 patients, with dupilumab concentrations that 
decreased from Week 4 onward and then stayed below or close to the limit of quantitation (BLQ) 
despite continued treatment with dupilumab.

status of patients in the Dupilumab 300mg q2w-q4w group- ADA population 
A slightly lower mean dupilumab exposure was observed for the treatment-emergent ADA response 
patients with NAb positive status. However, there was an overlap in individual dupilumab exposure 
regardless of NAb status, only those patients with high titer responses resulted in substantially 
reduced exposure. 
• 
ADA and efficacy 
The relationship between ADA and clinical response (co-primary endpoints: change from baseline in 
NPS and change from baseline in NC score at Week 24) was investigated in ADA-positive patients. 
It has to be noted that the evaluation is based on numerical imbalance between ADA-positive 
patients (N=25) compared with ADA-negative patients (N = 268) for the pooled 300 mg q2w group 
[Arm A+B]).  
The LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 in NPS was -1.35 for the ADA-positive and -1.73 
for the ADA-negative patients, while the LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 in NC was -
0.98 for the ADA-positive and -1.27 for the ADA-negative patients.

Table 6 Change from baseline in bilateral NPS at Week 24 by ADA status - ADA 
population 
For the 3 patients with high titer ADA (>10 000; 2 patients in the 300 mg q2w group and 1 patient 
in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group), dupilumab concentrations were consistently reduced to the below 
detection level and the results in NPS did not show a sustained or consistent improvement 
throughout the study. Additionally, 2 of these 3 patients had a TEAE of nasal polyps, consistent 
with lack of efficacy. Nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) showed a sustained improvement in 1 of 
the 3 patients. 
• 
ADA and adverse events 
Analyses of TEAEs by MedDRA primary SOC and PT were performed for subgroups of patients 
based on ADA response status. Additionally, focused analyses evaluated any potential association 
of hypersensitivity and serious or severe (lasting more than 24 hours) injection site reactions by 
ADA response status. 
33 patients who were ADA-positive (8 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w, 18 in the 300 mg q2w-q4w, 
and 7 patients in the placebo group). Of these patients 28 had TEAEs. However, no apparent 
pattern or increased incidence was identified. TEAEs that occurred in more than one patient in the 
either dupilumab group included nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, 
headache, nasal polyps, asthma, nasal discomfort, cough, arthralgia, injection site reaction, 
injection site bruising, accidental overdose, and fall (in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group). 
Four patients with a treatment-emergent ADA response had events that were considered SAEs 
and/or had a TEAE that resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. One patient in the 300 
mg q2w group with lupus-like syndrome, two patients in the 300 mg q2w/q4w group with back 
pain and EGPA and one patient in the placebo group with miscarriage of partner pregnancy. There 
was no temporal relationship between the AE and the ADA positive response. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 23/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The 3 patients with high ADA titer (>10 000) experienced at least one TEAE during the study, none 
of which were serious or led to permanent treatment discontinuation. However, 2 these patients 
had the TEAE of worsening of nasal polyps. 
Analysis of the potential impact of NAb on TEAEs was limited by the small number of patients with 
a positive NAb response. Of the 17 patients with a NAb response across the 3 treatment groups (5, 
9, and 3 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w, 300 mg q2w-q4w, and placebo groups 
respectively), 14 patients had at least one TEAE, with no apparent pattern or increase in TEAE 
incidence. TEAES that occurred in more than one patient included nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, 
headache, nasal polyps, injection site bruising, and accidental overdose. 
Since the initial cut-off date, 7 additional patients with a positive NAb response had at least one 
TEAE, all of them in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group. Cumulatively, of the 25 patients with a 
positive NAb response across the 3 treatment groups (5, 17, and 3 patients in the dupilumab 300 
mg q2w, 300 mg q2w-q4w, and placebo groups respectively), 21 patients had at least one TEAE, 
with no apparent pattern or increase in TEAE incidence. 
•  Analysis of hypersensitivity reactions and other adverse events of interest by ADA status 
None of the 27 ADA-positive patients had a potential hypersensitivity reaction. One ADA-positive 
patient had EGPA. This patient had been assigned to the placebo group, but accidently received a 
single dose of 300 mg dupilumab on Day 30, more than 300 days prior to the episode of EGPA. 
One patient (dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group) had a serious or severe injection site reaction 
lasting more than 24 hours but was ADA negative throughout the study. 4 of the 27 ADA-positive 
patients (1 [12.5%] in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 3 [25.0%] in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group 
and 0 in the placebo group) had an event coded to the HLT of injection site reaction. In 
comparison, 66 of 418 of ADA-negative patients with an injection site reaction (15.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w, 18.4% in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 14.1% in the placebo group). 
None of these events were considered serious or led to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
Overall, the observed incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was low and no meaningful differences 
between treatment groups were observed in patients with a treatment-emergent ADA response at 
Week 52 (4.0% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w, 4.8% for dupilumab q2w-q4w and 4.8% for the 
placebo group).  
The majority of the ADA responses had low ADA titer. ADA formation did not appear to correlate 
with any safety findings. For the 3 patients with high titer ADA a reduced dupilumab concentration 
in serum was seen and NPS and NC did not show a sustained improvement throughout the study.  
It has to be noted that the evaluation of relationship between ADA and clinical response was based 
on small number of ADA-positive patients (N=19) compared with the ADA-negative patients (N = 
274). 
PK parameters across studies in patients with CRSwNP 
Dupilumab steady-state exposure was similar across the studies with various dupilumab treatment 
durations. The Pop PK model estimates were consistent with the observed values for Ctrough.

Table 7 Mean (SD) steady-state exposure of dupilumab in patients with CRSwNP (Studies 
ACT12340, EFC14146, and EFC14280) 
Dupilumab PK comparison between CRSwNP and other patient populations 
The baseline demographic characteristics of adult patients with CRSwNP, asthma and AD across the 
3 clinical programs were similar. Dupilumab PK profiles in CRSwNP, asthma and AD patient 
populations were compared descriptively and via independent Pop PK analyses (Studies POH0611, 
POH0530, and REGN668MX16103). 
The observed concentration-time profiles in patients with CRSwNP are similar across the CRSwNP 
studies and similar to the asthma and AD populations except the less rapidly increased 
concentrations due to the absence of a loading dose in patients with CRSwNP.  
Following an initial SC dose of 300 mg in patients with CRSwNP and 600 mg in patients with AD 
and asthma, dupilumab reached Cmax (mean ± SD) of 30.5±9.39 mg/L and 70.1±24.1 mg/L, 
respectively. The observed dupilumab steady-state exposure (Ctrough) showed a high degree of 
similarity across CRSwNP, asthma and AD patient populations with various dupilumab treatment 
durations.

patients with CRSwNP (without a loading dose) and asthma and AD (with a loading dose 
of 600 mg) 
Additionally, the similarity in the PK of dupilumab between CRSwNP, asthma, and AD populations is 
supported by the results of the Pop PK analysis conducted separately for the 3 populations.  
Table 8 Comparison of Pop PK model estimates of key PK parameters between CRSwNP, 
asthma and AD populations 
Dupilumab concentration-over-time profiles in a typical CRSwNP, asthma or AD patient, as 
predicted from the respective CRSwNP, asthma, and AD Pop PK models, are comparable.  
The main sources of variability of dupilumab PK identified in each population and the magnitude of 
the covariate effects indicate that body weight is the most influential factor on dupilumab PK. Other 
covariates identified as being statistically significant have shown no meaningful impact.

Steady-state and accumulation 
In the Phase 2a CRSwNP Study ACT12340, dupilumab concentrations increased to a mean value of 
76.3 mg/L at Week 2 after administration of a 600 mg loading dose for the 300 mg qw regimen. 
The concentrations continued to increase to a mean steady state (Ctrough) level of 166 mg/L by 
Week 12.  
In the pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280) no loading dose was administered. The 
300 mg q2w dosing regimen resulted in a mean dupilumab trough concentration of 21.5−22.3 
mg/L at Week 2 and a mean steady-state trough level of 69.2−80.2 mg/mL at Week 24. The 
steady state Ctrough was achieved by Week 16 and was maintained up to 52 weeks. These results 
indicate the lack of a time-dependent change in dupilumab PK. 
Based on the CRSwNP Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state was 16 weeks for 300 mg 
q2w without, which is longer than AD and asthma studies where a 600 mg loading dose was used. 
When switched from 300 mg q2w to 300 mg q4w at Week 24, the model predicts that a new 
steady state was achieved after an additional 24 weeks.

Figure 13 Comparison of typical concentration-time profiles of dupilumab at 300 mg q2w 
and 300 mg q2w−q4w predicted by CRSwNP Pop PK models  
The dupilumab drug concentration data showed that more patients in the 300 mg q2wq4w regimen 
(8.7%) had steady-state concentrations that were below the limit of quantitation (0.078 mg/L) 
than those in the 300 mg q2w regimen (1.8%) at Week 52. A lower proportion of patients at the 
300 mg q2w-q4w regimen (86%) maintained steady-state trough concentrations above the EC50 
(1.75 mg/L) of NPS response compared to 300 mg q2w (97%) (see below). The proportion of 
patients who maintained Week 52 steady-state trough concentrations above the EC90 (15.8 mg/L) 
of NPS response was 98%, and 41% at 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w regimens, respectively. 
Based on these observations, complete saturation of target mediated elimination may not have 
been maintained in all patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w regimen after switching to a 300 mg q4w 
schedule and we cannot exclude disease control erosion with 300 mg q4w regimen upon longer 
term dosing eg, after 52-week treatment period. 
C) Pharmacokinetic Results (study ACT2340) 
Following SC administration of dupilumab at 300 mg qw following a 600 mg loading dose on Day 1, 
trough concentrations (Ctrough) increased with each subsequent dose administration, and appeared 
to reach steady state by Week 12 with mean (SD) steady-state Ctrough of 166.4 (52.8) mg/L. 
Accumulation, as assessed by Ctrough following the 12th dose relative to that after the 1st dose, was 
2.18-fold.

Immunogenicity Results:  
A low incidence of treatment-emergent ADA response was observed in both treatment groups. 
Treatment-emergent ADAs were reported in 3 out of 30 patients who received dupilumab 
treatment and 4 out of 30 patients who received placebo. The PK exposure in ADA positive patients 
was within the variability of that in ADA negative patients. No definitive conclusion could be made 
on the impact of ADA on PK given the small sample size and limited incidence of treatment-
emergent ADA in ACT12340. 
Pooled immunogenicity Results 
Given the different measurement time points and limited patient numbers in Study ACT12340, a 
summary of ADA, and NAb incidence for CRSwNP patients is provided and pooled only for Studies 
EFC14146 and EFC14280.

and EFC14280)

The pool of dupilumab 300 mg q2w arms in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 is the principal 
source of data to evaluate ADA responses in patients with CRSwNP with the same treatment 
duration (24 weeks) and enables an adequate evaluation of ADA responses. The incidence of 
treatment-emergent ADA was 4.3% in the 300 mg q2w group compared to 2.1% in the placebo 
group. Persistent ADA response was observed in 1.6% of all patients at 300 mg q2w compared to 
0.7% for placebo. Most of these treatment emergent ADA responses were low titer. High titer ADA 
response (>10 000) was observed in 0.9% of patients treated with dupilumab and was not 
observed in patients on placebo. Approximately 2.5% of all patients at 300 mg q2w were classified 
as neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive compared to 0.7% in the placebo group. 
The treatment-emergent ADA incidence was similar (2.1 to 4.8%) following dupilumab treatment 
for 24 weeks (300 mg q2w in Study EFC14146) or 52 weeks (300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2−q4w in 
Study EFC14280) as well as placebo treatment (0.7% to 4.8% in Studies EFC14146 and 
EFC14280). However, the proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent ADA positive response 
in the post-treatment period varied depending on the follow-up duration (13.7% for 300 mg q2w 
with 24-week follow-up in Study EFC14146 versus 2.4% for 12-week follow-up in Study EFC14280) 
and dose regimen (14.3% for 300 mg q2w-q4w versus 2.4% for 300 mg q2w in Study EFC14280). 
It is to be noted that the 24-week treatment pool does not include a follow-up period, while a 12 to 
24-week follow-up duration is included in the TEAE period for Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280, 
which explains the apparent numerical difference of treatment-emergent ADA incidence between 
the pool and the individual studies 
Table 10 ADA incidence in patients with CRSwNP, asthma and AD in 52-week studies 
(EFC14280, EFC13579 and AD-1224) 
5.4% of patients with CRSwNP who received dupilumab 300 mg q2w for 52 weeks developed 
antibodies to dupilumab. 2.0% of patients exhibited persistent ADA responses, and 3.4% had 
neutralizing antibodies while 4.0% of patients in the placebo group in the 52-week study were 
positive for antibodies to dupilumab. A total of 0.7% of patients exhibited persistent ADA response 
and 2.0% had neutralizing antibodies. The ADA incidence was similar across the CRSwNP, AD, and 
asthma populations with respect to treatment emergent positive ADA response (5-6%), persistent 
ADA response (~2%), and neutralizing antibody response (1-3%) after 52 weeks of treatment at 
300 mg q2w.

EMA/547569/2019 
Page 30/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Although treatment-emergent ADA positive patients appeared to have lower mean exposure 
compared with that of ADA negative patients, the individual exposures observed in patients with 
low to moderate titer ADA response were generally within the exposure range in ADA negative 
patients. Reduced dupilumab exposures were observed in very few patients with high titer ADA 
responses (N=3 with dupilumab concentration data including one patient who discontinued 
treatment at Week 20), with dupilumab concentrations that decreased from Week 4 onward and 
then stayed below or close to LLOQ of the assay (0.078 mg/L). In patients who developed ADA 
(including NAb) response with low to moderate titer no clear evidence was seen of lack or loss of 
efficacy. Two of the 3 patients who had high titer ADAs and low drug concentration had an 
apparent lack of treatment effect.  The safety profile in patients with a positive ADA status 
appeared similar to that of patients with a negative ADA status. 
Absorption 
In patients with CRSwNP, dupilumab is well-absorbed. A model-estimated SC bioavailability of 
62.8% has been reported. This is similar to the reported bioavailability of 64% in the adult AD 
patient population of the initial AD submission.  
Based on the CRSwNP Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state was 16 weeks for 300 mg 
q2w without a loading dose in a typical individual. When switched from 300 mg q2w to 300 mg 
q4w at Week 24, the model predicted that a new steady state was achieved after an additional 24 
weeks (ie, 48 weeks from the start of dupilumab treatment) (see also POP PK MODEL BASED 
SIMULATION in Section 3.3.4 of this AR). 
The observed trough concentrations and Pop PK model-based post hoc estimates of dupilumab 
exposure at steady state (Ctrough) are summarized below for CRSwNP Phase 2 and 3 studies. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 31/238 
 
  
  
 
 
Distribution 
Distribution primarily took place within the vascular compartment (model-estimated volume of 
distribution at 4.91 L). For monoclonal antibodies, limited volume of distribution is expected. 
Elimination 
For a monoclonal antibody, the elimination of dupilumab is expected to be limited to proteolytic 
catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids, and therefore, no specific metabolism or 
excretion studies were conducted. 
Dupilumab exhibits saturable target-mediated elimination. At the PK steady-state concentration for 
the 300 mg q2w regimen, the PK data show a small deviation from dose-proportional increases in 
exposure. After the last SC dose at steady state, the model-predicted median time for dupilumab 
concentration to decline from PK steady state to below the LLOQ (0.078 mg/L) level was 12 weeks 
for the 300 mg q2w and 6 weeks for the 300 mg q2w−q4w regimen. These parameters are 
consistent with those reported for dupilumab in the AD and asthma population. 
Linear clearance has been derived to 0.113 L/day, which is comparable to the CL in the asthma 
(0.115) and AD population (0.131).  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Dose proportionality 
Monoclonal antibodies characterized by nonlinear target-mediated kinetics, such as dupilumab, are 
found to exhibit a greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure. This nonlinear PK profile is 
typically observed at drug concentrations below that required to saturate the target-mediated 
clearance pathway. As drug concentrations increase to levels greater than those required to 
saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK profile reverts to a dose-proportional profile. 
Cross study comparison of observed Ctrough (Studies ACT12340, EFC14146, and EFC14280), 
showed 2.37−2.75-fold increase from 64.0−74.4 mg/L to 176 mg/L in the mean Ctrough at Week 
16 for a 2-fold dose increase from 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw.  In Study EFC14280, there was a 
4.29-fold increase from 17.6 mg/L to 75.5 mg/L in the mean Ctrough at Week 52 for a 2-fold dose 
increase from 300 mg q4w to 300 mg q2w. Although there are limitations in comparison of Ctrough 
for different dosing regimens, the results were consistent with AUCτ,ss, suggesting a greater than 
dose proportional increase between 300 mg q4w and 300 mg q2w and then a close to dose 
proportional increase between 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw. 
Based on the CRSwNP Pop PK model-based post hoc estimates, cross study comparison of AUCτ,ss 
at steady state, mean AUCτ,ss were similar for 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw, indicating no major 
deviation from dose proportionality between 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw and suggesting a 
saturation of the target-mediated elimination at doses of 300 mg q2w and higher. 
A greater than dose proportional increase in exposure from 300 mg q4w to 300 mg q2w suggests 
that some patients may have not reached full saturation of the target-mediated elimination at the 
steady-state exposure of 300 mg q4w. More patients in the 300 mg q2w−q4w regimen (8.7%) had 
steady-state Ctrough at the end of the 52-week treatment that were below the limit of quantitation 
(0.078 mg/L) than those in the 300 mg q2w regimen (1.8%).

Time dependency 
Following the administration of a 600 mg loading dose for the 300 mg qw regimen to patients with 
CRSwNP in the Phase 2a Study ACT12340, dupilumab concentrations rose to a mean value of 76.3 
mg/L at Week 2. The concentrations continued to increase over time and reached a mean steady 
state (Ctrough) level of 166 mg/L by Week 12 (Figure 5). In the pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 
and EFC14280), without a loading dose, 300 mg q2w resulted in a mean dupilumab trough 
concentration of 21.5−22.3 mg/L at Week 2 and a mean steady-state trough level of 69.2−80.2 
mg/mL at Week 24. The steady state Ctrough was achieved by Week 16 and was maintained up to

EMA/547569/2019

52 weeks for the q2w regimen during treatment in patients with CRSwNP. These results indicate 
the lack of a time-dependent change in dupilumab PK. 
Special populations 
Sources of pharmacokinetic variability 
In the pivotal studies in the CRSwNP population the observed variability of steady state trough 
concentrations after repeated SC doses of dupilumab 300 mg q2w was in the range of 42.6 to 
53.4%. For the 300 mg q2w−q4w group (Study EFC14280) the observed variability of steady state 
trough concentrations was in the range of 88.3 to 98.4% following the decrease in dose to 300 mg 
q4w. Consistently the CRSwNP Pop PK analysis showed moderate IIV in PK parameters 
Fsc(41.9%), Ka(44.0%), Ke(17.2%), V2(8.09%), and Vmax (29.1%) (Study POH0611).

Dupilumab steady-state exposure (AUCτ,ss) by covariate category in patients with CRSwNP from Studies 
EFC14146 and EFC14280 (Study POH0611) by demographic, laboratory parameter, and ADA covariate category 
•  Body weight 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 35/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Body weight was determined to be the key factor contributing to PK variability in patients with AD 
and asthma. Similarly, body weight was the primary source of dupilumab PK variability in patients 
with CRSwNP. 
The range in body weight in the CRSwNP Pop PK population was 38 to 150 kg, with a significant 
effect on linear elimination rate constant (Ke), central compartment volume (V2) and maximum 
rate of target mediated elimination (Vmax) (Study POH0611). 
The greater effect of body weight on steady state exposure at 300 mg q4w than at 300 mg q2w is 
consistent with the greater IIV at 300 mg q4w. These data suggest that the steady state exposure 
at 300 mg q2w−q4w is more sensitive to the effect of weight compared to 300 mg q2w, which is 
likely due to non-linear saturable target-mediated elimination predominating at lower 
concentrations towards the end of the 300 mg q4w dosing interval. 
Mean (SD) dupilumab steady-state exposure by body weight category in patients with CRSwNP (Study 
POH0611) 
There was no clinically meaningful difference in dupilumab efficacy or safety profiles across the 
weight categories in patients with CRSwNP.  
•  Age 
The CRSwNP Pop PK analysis (Study POH0611) with data from CRSwNP patients ranging in age 
from 19.1 to 83.3 years did not identify age as a significant covariate influencing dupilumab PK. 
It should be noted that there was a very limited number of patients ≥75 years (N=11), 
representing 2.4% of total patients in the Pop PK dataset. However, 81 patients ≥65 years of age, 
representing 17.4% of total patients are included in the Pop PK dataset. 
A summary of post hoc estimates of individual steady-state exposure for patients in the pivotal 
Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280) is presented by age category in Table 9. The 
differences in dupilumab exposure across the age categories were not considered to be clinically 
meaningful and, therefore, a dose adjustment for age is not recommended in patients with 
CRSwNP. 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (<18 years of age) with CRSwNP has not 
been studied. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 36/238 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Gender 
No difference has been seen in the observed dupilumab concentrations between female and male 
patients in CRSwNP studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280). Similar to the previous finding for AD 
patients and asthma patients, the CRSwNP Pop PK analysis (Study POH0611) of data from 288 
male and 177 female subjects did not identify gender as a significant covariate for dupilumab PK. 
Consistently, there is no notable difference in post hoc estimates of individual steady-state 
exposure between male and female CRSwNP patients. 
•  Race/ethnicity 
Race was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic 
exposure of dupilumab by population PK analysis. 
The CRSwNP Pop PK analysis (Study POH0611) of the data consisting of Caucasian (N=408, 
87.7%), Asian (N=37, 8.0%; includes Asian patients from all counties), Black (N=7, 1.5%), and 
other patients (N=11, 2.4%) did not identify race as a significant covariate impacting dupilumab 
pharmacokinetics.  
A trend of higher exposure in Asians compared to Caucasians in the observed concentrations and 
the post hoc estimates of individual steady-state exposure was seen.  This effect is primarily 
explained by the difference in body weight (median body weight of 64.6 kg in Asians versus 80.0 
kg in Caucasians). Similarly, the higher mean exposure in this subset of Japanese patients versus 
the rest of the population (non-Japanese) is mainly the result of differences in body weight. 
•  Renal impairment 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No 
clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal 
impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of dupilumab. 
Very limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. 
In the CRSwNP Pop PK analysis population (Study POH0611), the majority of subjects had normal 
renal function (N=383, 82.5%) or mild renal impairment (N=71, 15.3%). A small number of 
subjects had moderate renal impairment (N=10, 2.2%) and none had severe renal impairment. 
Creatinine clearance did not have a statistically significant effect on dupilumab PK in the CRSwNP 
population. Consistently, there was considerable overlap in individual steady-state exposure 
between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and normal renal function (Table 10). 
The apparent difference in mean exposures between categories from this post hoc univariate 
analysis is due to the confounding effect of body weight and is not a reflection of a direct effect of 
renal function on dupilumab PK. Therefore, a dose adjustment for renal function is not considered 
necessary.

EMA/547569/2019 
Page 37/238 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Hepatic function 
Antibodies, such as dupilumab, are not cleared through the liver and instead are eliminated 
primarily via proteolytic catabolism by the reticulo-endothelial system distributed throughout the 
body. As such, no formal study was conducted to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on 
dupilumab PK. 
•  Albumin 
Albumin did not have a statistically significant effect on dupilumab PK in the CRSwNP population 
(Study POH0611). In the previous AD and asthma Pop PK analyses, albumin had a statistically 
significant, but not clinically meaningful, effect on dupilumab PK. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction  
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, directed against IL-4Rα, is not expected to have a direct or 
indirect effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-mediated metabolism. This was confirmed in the 
drug interaction Study R668-AD-1433 in patients with atopic dermatitis, where there was no 
clinically relevant effect of dupilumab on the activities of CYP isoforms including CYP1A2, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6 and 3A. The results indicate that IL-4/IL-13 has no meaningful impact on CYP enzymes 
in vivo. 
The absence of clinically meaningful modulation of CYP isoforms by dupilumab indicated that 
clinically relevant drug-drug interactions between dupilumab and CRSwNP agents metabolized by 
these CYP enzymes are unlikely to occur. 
The CRSwNP Pop PK analysis evaluated the effects of 4 classes of common concomitant CRSwNP 
medications (eg, INCS [QD versus BID], systemic antihistamines, OCS, and allergen 
immunotherapy) on dupilumab PK. Based on the comparison of post hoc estimates of individual 
steady-state exposure, the concomitant use of these CRSwNP controller medications has no 
apparent effect on dupilumab PK (Study POH0611).

No apparent effect of the CRSwNP medication on the PK of Dupilumab has been identified. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4) antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 
(IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signalling by specifically binding to the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-
4Rα) sub-unit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. 
Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signalling via the Type I receptor (IL 4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 
signalling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits 
IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine- induced responses, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, and IgE. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Blood levels of the type 2 inflammation biomarkers (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine 
[TARC], total IgE, eosinophil cationic protein [ECP], and periostin) were assessed as markers for 
disease activity/severity. These same markers and eotaxin-3 were also assessed from nasal 
secretions to similarly gain an understanding of dupilumab's actions in the sino-nasal cavity. In 
addition, the dupilumab effect on leukotriene E4 (LTE4) in urine, a stable end product of the 
cysteinyl leukotriene pathway and a marker of activation of mast cells, involved in type 2 
inflammation in patients with CRSwNP and NSAID-ERD, was explored. 
a) Study EFC14146 
After 24 weeks, markedly decreased concentrations of blood total IgE in the dupilumab group was 
seen compared to placebo. Moreover, dupilumab treatment reduced levels of urinary LTE4 at Week 
24 as compared to placebo. This decrease in LTE4, a type 2 urinary biomarker associated with 
activation and chemotaxis of mast cells and Th2 cells, was noted both in the dupilumab treated 
patient population, and in the subgroup of patients with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD). 
•  Serum total IgE 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 39/238 
 
  
  
 
 
At baseline, serum total IgE concentrations were in the same range among the treatment groups. 
At week 24 the results show a decline through the treatment period for the dupilumab group of -
111.62 IU/mL, while remaining relatively unchanged for the placebo group with +19.06 IU/mL. 
Summary of serum total IgE (IU/mL) over time - Safety population 
•  Antigen-specific IgE 
There were no notable differences in serum antigen-specific IgE at baseline between the treatment 
groups. A similar percentage of patients were below the LLOQ for all antigens (31.5% versus 
29.5%), greater than or equal to the LLOQ for only one antigen (12.6% versus 14.4%), and 
greater than or equal to the LLOQ for at least 2 antigens (55.9% versus 56.1%), in the dupilumab 
and placebo groups respectively.  
At week 24, 42.0% of patients in the dupilumab group were below the LLOQ for all antigens 
compared to 30.3% in the placebo group. A lower percentage of patients in the dupilumab group 
versus the placebo group were greater than or equal to the LLOQ for at least 2 antigens (43.4% 
versus 56.8%), regardless of baseline status. 
• 
Plasma eotaxin-3 
Due to an error made in the calibration curves established during the quantification of plasma 
eotaxin-3 and the impact of this error on the accuracy of data the results are not available. 
•  Urine leukotriene E4 
As IL-4/13 upregulates expression of LTE4 synthases in many of the cells involved in type 2 
inflammation urinary LTE4 level were assessed. Urinary LTE4 levels are high in patients with nasal 
polyps, or chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis. At baseline, urine LTE4 concentrations were similar 
among both treatment groups (mean concentration [SD]: 328.35 [650.43] for the dupilumab 300

mg q2w and 312.97 [1236.86] for placebo). At Week 24, the mean change in LTE4 from baseline 
was -234.70 for the dupilumab and -92.19pg/mL for the placebo group, demonstrating a significant 
higher decrease in urine LTE4 concentration in patients receiving dupilumab. Urine leukotriene E4 
in patients with NSAID-ERD history was also assessed. At Week 24, the mean change in LTE4 from 
baseline was -383.82 and +23.43 pg/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and the placebo group, 
respectively. However, the baseline levels were different in this population (mean concentration 
[SD]: 499.95 [772.80], and 279.30 [412.51] pg/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo 
groups, respectively). 
b) Study EFC14280 
•  Serum total IgE 
At baseline the serum total IgE concentrations were in the same range among the treatment 
groups. Throughout the treatment period the concentration of serum total IgE declined in both 
dupilumab treatment groups, while no decline was seen for placebo. At Week 52, the mean 
changes from baseline were -156.92 IU/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, -189.62 IU/mL 
for the 300 mg q2w-q4w groups and +64.09 IU/mL for the placebo group. The mean change from 
Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group 
(Arm B) was -26.42 IU/mL and -42.67 IU/mL, respectively.

•  Serum thymus and activation regulatory chemokine (TARC)/CCL17 
At baseline, serum TARC/CCL17 (a type 2 chemokine whose receptor CCR4 is predominantly 
expressed on Th2 lymphocytes and basophils) concentrations were similar among the treatment 
groups. 
A decrease in TARC was observed at Week 24 and remained at a low level through Week 52 for 
both dupilumab groups. At Week 52, the mean change in TARC from baseline was -158.53 pg/mL 
for the  dupilumab 300 mg q2w, -126.23 pg/mL for the and 300 mg q2w-q4w groups and -15.09 
pg/mL for the placebo group. 
The mean change from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 
mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was +0.54 pg/ml and +18.00 pg/mL.

•  Serum periostin 
At baseline, concentrations of serum periostin were similar among the treatment groups. A 
decrease of periostin was observed at the first assessment at Week 24 and continued through 
Week 52 for patients in both dupilumab groups (300 mg q2w / dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w). At 
Week 52, the mean change in periostin from baseline was -45.42 ng/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w and -39.79 ng/mL for the 300 mg q2w-q4w groups, while nearly unchanged for the placebo 
group with -4.73 ng/mL. The mean change from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was -6.17 and -4.86 ng/mL, respectively

•  Urine leukotriene E4 
The urine LTE4 concentrations were similar among the treatment groups at baseline. 
A decrease in urine LTE4 was observed at the first assessment at Week 24 and continued to decline 
to Week 52 for both dupilumab dose groups. At Week 52, the mean change in LTE4 from baseline 
was -150.48 for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w, -131.10 pg/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w 
group and -0.52 pg/mL for the placebo group. So the highest decrease was seen in the 300 mg 
q2w group.

In patients with NSAID-ERD the mean change in LTE4 from baseline to Week 52was -345.44 for 
the dupilumab 300 mg q2w, -340.00 pg/mL for the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and was -14.14 
pg/mL for the placebo group. 
Sub-study of biomarkers in nasal secretions 
In 130 patients a substudy was performed. Nasal secretions were assayed for local biomarkers 
related to nasosinus inflammation and NP, such as ECP, total IgE, eotaxin-3 at baseline and Week 
24. Results presented are not normalized for total proteins in nasal secretions. The analysis of 
periostin and IL5 in nasal secretion was not available at the time of the database lock for the CSR 
and will be reported later in a CSR addendum. 
ECP and eotaxin-3 concentrations were similar among the treatment groups at baseline. At Week 
24, the mean change from baseline in ECP was -31.9 ng/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and -
15.0 ng/mL for the placebo group. The mean change from baseline in eotaxin-3 was -69.471 
pg/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and +24.944 pg/mL for the placebo group. The mean 
change in from baseline in total IgE was -36.81 IU/mL for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group and 
+2.72 IU/mL for the placebo group.  
c) Study ACT12340 (supportive study) 
Rapid (as early as Week 2) and marked reductions in circulating type 2 biomarkers including TARC 
and eotaxin-3 concentrations were observed in the dupilumab group compared with placebo. A 
gradual decrease in blood total IgE was also noted in response to dupilumab treatment. Decreases 
in type 2 biomarkers from nasal secretions including total IgE, eotaxin-3, ECP and periostin were 
observed in response to dupilumab treatment, relative to placebo, indicating a direct effect of 
dupilumab on type 2 inflammation in the nasal tissue. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (eg, age, race, gender, disease characteristics, ADA etc.) 
on dupilumab PK in patients with CRSwNP was evaluated via Pop PK analysis.. In the first Pop PK 
analysis of dupilumab, conducted using pooled data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy adults and 
Phase 2 and 3 studies in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD, body weight was the primary 
source of dupilumab PK variability. Other identified statistically significant covariates (albumin, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 43/238 
 
  
  
 
 
eczema area and severity index [EASI], ADA status, and race) did not have a clinically meaningful 
effect on the dupilumab PK parameters in the AD population. 
The subsequent asthma Pop PK analysis shared the AD Pop PK model structure and included data 
pooled from Phase 2 (Studies ACT11457 and DRI12544) and Phase 3 (Study EFC13579) studies in 
adult and adolescent patients with asthma. 
The CRSwNP Pop PK strategy involved the development of a global Pop PK base model first with 
pooled data from healthy subjects and patients with AD and asthma patients (Study POH0668). 
This base model was then extended to allow the identification of covariates in a Pop PK model for 
the CRSwNP population using pooled data from Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 studies in adult 
patients with CRSwNP (Study POH0611). 
The different studies performed are described hereafter. 
a) Study POH0611 
Title  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Dupilumab Using Pooled Data from One Phase 2 
and Two Phase 3 Studies in Patients with Nasal Polyposis 
The main objectives of this analysis were to confirm and apply dupilumab global base population 
pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) model in CRSwNP patients, to assess the influence of intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors on dupilumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in NP patients and to predict individual 
dupilumab exposure in NP patients. 
The analysis was conducted with data available up to two separate cut-off dates, one for Pop PK 
model development and covariate analysis and the other for individual exposure prediction in 
CRSwNP patients. Pop PK model development and covariate analysis in NP patients was conducted 
based on a pooled dataset including complete PK data from one Phase 2 study (ACT12340), as well 
as the partial data up to a Pop PK data cut-off date of Feb 12, 2018 from two pivotal Phase 3 
studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280). The post-hoc estimates of individual PK steady-state exposure 
for each NP patient were generated based on a pooled dataset including complete PK data from 
study ACT12340 and clinical data after the latest clinical database lock (Sep 24, 2018) from two 
pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280). 
A total of 466 CRSwNP patients and 2580 functional dupilumab concentration records were 
available in the Initial Dataset from the three studies used for CRSwNP Pop PK model development. 
Placebo data were excluded from the dataset.  
Summary of PK data included in Pop PK model development 
Pre-dose and post-dose samples that were BLQ (N=593), pre-dose samples above LLOQ (N=1), as 
well as dupilumab samples with dosing issue (N=9), were flagged and kept in the dataset and 
excluded by the analysis software. After database lock, an error was noted in the calibration curves

established during the quantification of plasma eotaxin-3. As a consequence, plasma eotaxin-3 was 
not tested as a covariate in the Pop PK analysis. 
The pooled population was 61.9% male and age ranged from 19 to 83 years. CRSwNP patients had 
a relatively broader range of weight (38.0 to 150 kg).

Base model selection 
The observed mean dupilumab concentration time profiles for CRSwNP  patients who received 300 
mg q2w in studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 were compared to the observed profiles for AD and 
asthma patients who received 300 mg q2w (with a loading dose of 600 mg) from three phase 3 
studies (studies AD-1334, AD-1416 and EFC13579). The observed PK data confirmed the similarity 
dupilumab PK profiles across adult AD, asthma and CRSwNP populations.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 46/238 
 
  
  
 
 
The adequacy of global Pop PK base model to describe dupilumab PK in CRSwNP patients was 
initially evaluated by comparing the observed concentrations and the predicted concentrations from 
global Pop PK base model by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) bayesian estimation approach. The 
mean values of population prediction error and absolute population prediction error for all the 
concentrations from the 3 studies at weeks 4- 24 were 13.6% and 33.6%, respectively. This 
indicates a reasonable applicability of global Pop PK base model to be used as the start point of NP 
Pop PK base model selection. 
The final CRSwNP Pop PK base model was selected due to good precision of parameter estimates 
and good model performance. This was a two-compartment model with first order absorption, and 
parallel linear and nonlinear elimination. Most PK parameters (except for V2, Ke, and Vmax) were 
fixed to values estimated with data from clinical studies in HV, AD and asthma patients. IIV was 
estimated for Ke and random effect parameters were estimated. 
Among the tested covariates, only body weight was identified to be a statistical significant 
covariate on dupilumab PK in NP patients. The final CRSwNP Pop PK model included weight as a 
covariate on central compartment (V2), first order elimination rate constant (Ke), and maximum 
nonlinear eliminate rate (Vmax).

Impact of covariates 
The descriptive summary of steady-state exposures of dupilumab after 300 mg qw (with a loading 
dose of 600 mg) and 300 mg q2w repeated doses in Phase 2 and 3 studies (ACT12340, EFC14146 
and EFC14280) as a function of tested covariates is provided in Table 14 for both continuous and 
categorical covariate candidates. The apparent difference in PK exposures across age, race and 
CLCR groups is mainly explained by the difference in the body weight. The descriptive summary of 
steady-state exposures of dupilumab after 300 mg q2w-q4w as a function of weight category is 
provided in Table 15. The impact of comorbidity (asthma) and concomitant medications on 
dupilumab PK exposures was found to be minimal, as shown in Table 16. 
A graphical representation of steady-state dupilumab exposures after 300 mg q2w repeated dosing 
in two phase 3 studies by covariates is provided in Figure 8. Similarly, the impact of comorbidity 
and concomitant medications on dupilumab PK exposures is shown in Figure 9.

Pop PK model based simulations 
Simulated typical PK profiles after different dupilumab regimens 
The concentration-time profiles for dupilumab were simulated for a typical patient (body weight 79 
kg [median weight of Final Dataset]) for two treatment regimens (300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-
q4w) in study EFC14280. These simulations were used to determine the time to achieve steady 
state (i.e., achieving 90% of Cmin,ss), as well as time for concentration to fall below LLOQ. 
Furthermore dupilumab concentration-time profiles at 300 mg q2w in adult CRSwNP patients with 
no loading dose was compared to those in adult asthma and AD patients with a loading dose of 600 
mg. The increase in dupilumab concentrations with repeated dosing in CRSwNP patients was slower 
than in AD and asthma patients due to the absence of the loading dose in CRSwNP patients. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 52/238 
 
  
  
 
 
However, dupilumab concentration-over-time profiles in typical CRSwNP, asthma or AD patients, as 
predicted from the respective CRSwNP, asthma and AD Pop PK models, are highly comparable.  
Comparison of dupilumab typical concentration-time profiles in adult patients with NP (300 mg q2w without 
loading dose) and asthma and AD (300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg) 
Simulations were also conducted to assess the impact of weight on steady-state exposures of 
dupilumab for treatment arms 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w. 
Impact of weight on dupilumab exposures 
A forest plot illustrating the impact of weight on steady state dupilumab exposure variables over 
the range of the 5th to 95th percentiles of body weights relative to a typical patient is shown in 
Figure 13. The results are summarised in Table 17. The results confirm the notable effect of weight 
on dupilumab steady state exposure in NP patients.

Title 
Dupilumab Global Population Pharmacokinetic Base Model Development Using Pooled 
Data from Atopic Dermatitis Patients, Asthma Patients, and Healthy Subjects 
The main objective of this analysis was to develop and qualify a global population pharmacokinetic 
(Pop PK) base model for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma patients. 
Concentrations of functional dupilumab in serum from 20 Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies, with Phase 1 
studies in healthy subjects (HV) after a single intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) 
administration of dupilumab and Phase 2 and 3 studies in AD and asthma patients, after repeated 
SC administration of dupilumab once every week (qw), two weeks (q2w) or four weeks (q4w), 
were included.

Summary of clinical studies included in the analysis 
A total of 4141 individuals (i.e., 202 HV, 1913 AD patients, and 2026 asthma patients) and 38759 
functional dupilumab concentration records were available in the Initial pooled Dataset from the 20 
studies used for global Pop PK model development. Following exclusion of concentrations below the 
lower limit of quantitation, LLOQ (BLQ), pre-dose measurable concentrations and outlier 
concentrations, the Final Dataset contained 30557 dupilumab samples from 4056 subjects 
(including 69 adolescents). 
Descriptive statistics of weight and age for the subjects in the Final Dataset 
The Pop PK analysis was performed with NONMEM (version 7.4) running on a LINUX cluster of 
multi-processor computers. 
The base model structure of asthma Pop PK model (two-compartment model with first order 
absorption and parallel linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination) was used as the 
starting point for the development of the global Pop PK base model. Two modelling approaches, 
one-step analysis (no parameter fixed at prior values) and step-wise analysis (fixing parameters 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 56/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
based on prior values), were evaluated for base model development. The final global Pop PK base 
model was selected on the basis of overall model performance (Figure 1). 
Base model selection 
Parameter estimates from step-wise and one-step analyses were consistent with each other and 
with those from prior AD and asthma models, except for numerical differences on Km. Both 
candidate base models well described AD and asthma data as evidenced by the lines of best fit 
through the data in the plots of observed versus individual predicted concentrations with little bias. 
Given both candidate global Pop PK base models performed similarly in describing dupilumab PK in 
AD and asthma patients, both models were further evaluated for the assessment of weight effects.

BODY WEIGHT EFFECTS ON PK 
The inclusion of weight effects into the global Pop PK base model during forward selection process 
including, presented in order of inclusion: 1) body weight on V2; 2) body weight on Vmax; 3) body 
weight on Ke.  
After backward elimination, there was no exclusion of body weight effect on any of the above 
parameters in the model. This covariate analysis of weight effects finding was consistent with those 
from prior Pop PK model of AD (R668-MX-16103-CP-01v1) and asthma (POH0530). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 59/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Summary of weight effects assessment during forward selection and backward elimination 
After inclusion of weight effect, inter-individual variability (IIV) estimates for key PK parameters 
(i.e. Ke, V2 and Vmax) decreased approximately 4.0% – 6.21% compared to the base model. 
Final global Pop PK base model 
The majority of parameter estimates from global Pop PK models with either step-wise or one-step 
analysis approach, were mostly comparable. The precision of PK parameter estimates was high 
throughout (%RSE < 40%). Key PK parameter estimates (e.g. bioavailability (F1), distribution 
volume at steady-state (Vss), linear clearance (CL)) based upon one-step analysis were more 
consistent with those of prior AD and asthma Pop PK models. The performance of global Pop PK 
model with step-wise or one-step analysis approach was further evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots.  
The global Pop PK base model with one-step analysis approach performed slightly better than the 
model with step-wise approach, as evidenced by relative lower r2 for both population and 
individual fits. Therefore, one-step analysis was selected for the final model based on the 
consistency of parameter estimates with prior AD and asthma models as well as the improved 
goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots. In the final global Pop PK model, the magnitude of unexplained IIV 
was moderate for Ka (44.0% CV), F1 (41.9% CV), and Vmax (29.1% CV), and relatively small for Ke 
(21.7% CV) and V2 (8.09% CV). Consistent with prior AD and asthma models, weight showed to 
have a notable effect explaining between-subject variability of dupilumab PK for both AD and 
asthma patients as shown in final global Pop PK base model. After inclusion of weight effects, IIV 
estimates for key PK parameters (i.e. Ke, V2 and Vmax) decreased approximately 4.0% – 6.21% 
compared to the base model.

MODEL VALIDATION 
To validate the predictability of final model, model simulations was compared to the observed 
mean PK profiles from representative AD and asthma studies (i.e. a dose ranging study as well as a 
pivotal Phase 3 study for each indication). The simulations based upon the global base model well 
described the observed PK profiles in AD and asthma patients across a wide dose range (100 mg 
q4w to 300 mg qw).

Observed vs. simulated mean concentration-time profiles from representative AD and asthma studies 
The simulations based upon the global base model well described the observed PK profiles in AD 
and asthma patients across a wide dose range (100 mg q4w to 300 mg qw). Overall, a good 
agreement between the model-predicted and observed PK profiles supports the predictability of 
final global Pop PK model (one-step analysis) for TH2 inflammatory disease populations across a 
wide dose range. 
The robustness of the final model and the accuracy of parameter estimates were assessed using a 
bootstrap method. From the Final Dataset of 4056 subjects, 500 runs were launched. 431 
successful runs were obtained with a successful covariance step (86.2% of the total number of runs 
launched). For each run, Pop PK parameters were estimated and the corresponding descriptive 
statistics such as median, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were computed for each Pop PK 
parameters. The median values obtained from the bootstrap were compared to those obtained in 
the final model of the original dataset. 
The visual predictive checks (VPC) technique was used to evaluate the performance of the final 
global Pop PK model (one-step analysis approach). The results of the VPC showed that a large 
majority of the observed concentrations were within in the prediction range [5th-95th percentiles] 
and a few concentration points outside of the percentile range appeared to distribute evenly on 
either side.

Visual predictive checks for final global Pop PK base model by study 
To assess the influence of outlier exclusion, the final model was performed on the Final Dataset 
including outlier samples. It was observed that there were no major changes in parameter 
estimates with or without the inclusion of outliers. 
c) POH0687 
Empirical Exposure-Response Analysis of Nasal Polyps Score, Nasal Congestion, Loss of 
Sense of Smell and 22-Item Sino-nasal Outcome Test for Dupilumab Nasal Polyposis 
Phase 3 Studies 
The two pivotal Phase 3 studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 were included in the PK/PD analyses 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 64/238 
 
  
  
 
 
For the E-R analysis, co-primary endpoints of nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal 
congestion/obstruction (NC), secondary endpoints of decreased/loss of sense of smell (LOSS) and 
22-item sino-nasal outcome test score (SNOT-22) were used. For each efficacy endpoint, two time 
points were considered, change from baseline to Week 24, and change from baseline to Week 52. 
Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 were pooled together to evaluate the exposure-response 
relationship for the four endpoints at Week 24 while Study EFC14280 alone was used to examine 
the exposure response relationship for the four endpoints at Week 52. 
Missing data for these efficacy endpoints were imputed, based on the worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF) method for patients who underwent surgery for NP or received rescue medicine. 
This imputation is consistent with the missing data imputation strategy specified in the integrated 
summary of efficacy (ISE) report. For patients who discontinued treatment without being rescued 
by surgery or rescue medicine, the multiple imputation method was used. However, due to lack of 
an appropriate method to integrate the multiple imputation method in the E-R modelling with the 
variable selection procedures, patients who discontinued treatment without being rescued by 
surgery or rescue medicine were excluded from the E-R analysis. Therefore, the PK/PD analysis 
population may not match the efficacy population in the clinical study report in the two studies. 
At Week 52, Study EFC14280 had the PK data cut-off as 6 August 2018, about 70% data at Week 
52 observed Ctrough were available and so missing observed Ctrough at Week 52 was predicted 
using the relevant post hoc population PK estimate (Study POH0611). 
Base model selection 
Three  base  models  of  the  E-R  relationship,  linear,  log  linear  and  maximum  drug  induced  effect 
(Emax), with appropriate covariates, were compared to select the best model by a goodness of fit 
criterion (the Akaike information criterion with sample size correction). 
For the base PK/PD model, the main effects (placebo effect) in the model include the baseline score 
of  the  efficacy  endpoint,  study  identifier,  asthma/  NSAID  (nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019

exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) status (Yes vs. No), Prior NP surgery (Yes vs No) and region 
(Asia, Latin America, east Europe, and Western countries). 
Additional covariate selection 
Effects of the following additional baseline covariates, either as a main effect or an interaction effect 
with dupilumab concentration, were explored in the PK/PD model:

Final model evaluation 
To examine the validity of the PK/PD model, model predictions and observed effects were compared. 
The  observed  effects  for  each  dose  were  estimated  using  the  Analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA) 
method for each study separately. The ANCOVA model included the change score from baseline at 
Week  24  as  the  response  variable  and  treatment  (as  treated),  the  baseline  score,  asthma/NERD 
status (Yes vs. No), Prior NP surgery (Yes vs No) and region (Asia, Latin America, east Europe, and 
Western countries) as covariates.  
Sensitivity analyses 
In Study EFC14280, approximately 6% patients who discontinued treatment without being rescued 
by surgery or rescue medicine were excluded from the E-R analysis at Week 52. 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  by  further  excluding  discontinued  patients  who  underwent 
surgery for NP or received rescue medicine (approximately 7% patients) at Week 52 (Table 2). 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  also  conducted  for  completers  at  Week  52.  In  the  completer  analyses, 
patient with missing observed Ctrough or discontinued treatment at Week 52 were excluded (Table 
2).

RESULTS 
NPS 
Quartile Plot and Summary Table at Week 24 
The NPS response for 300 mg q2w dose regimen at Week 24 appeared to be generally similar over 
the 3 higher exposure quartiles, suggesting that a further increase in dose/exposure would not 
result in a better response.

Exposure-Response Model at Week 24 
An Emax model is selected as the base model. The EC50 was stably estimated but with a large 
confidence interval, which reflected the high variability of responses at the low concentration 
range. Higher baseline age or higher UPSIT score was associated with significantly decreased 
placebo-adjusted treatment effect at Week 24 (significantly increased mean change score) given a 
fixed Ctrough while higher baseline periostin was associated with significantly increased placebo-
adjusted treatment effect at Week 24.

Quartile Plot and Summary Table at Week 52 
The majority of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w regimen were in the lower 2 quartiles (Q1 and 
Q2) while the majority of patients in the 300 mg q2w dose regimen were in the upper 2 quartiles 
(Q3 and Q4) at Week 52. At the lowest quartile of exposure, comprising mostly of patients at 300 
mg q2w-q4w, there was a numerically smaller improvement in NPS than at the other three 
quartiles suggesting greater efficacy at Week 52 (in terms of maximum treatment effect) with 300 
mg q2w dupilumab. 
Exposure-Response Model at Week 52 
The EC50 was stably estimated but with a large confidence interval, which reflected the high 
variability of responses at the low concentration range. Higher baseline age or higher baseline BMI 
associated with significantly decreased placebo-adjusted treatment effect at Week 52 (significantly

increased mean change score) given a fixed Ctrough while a prior medical history of asthma/NERD 
associated with significantly increased placebo-adjusted treatment effect at Week 52.

The PK/PD model prediction of NPS indicated that the treatment effect approached, but did not 
reach, the Emax at the exposure of 300 mg q2w-q4w and reached a plateau at the exposure of 
300 mg q2w. These results are in line with a numerically greater improvement in NPS observed for 
300 mg q2w compared to 300 mg q2w-q4w at Week 52.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical methods 
For functional dupilumab, study / disease specific incurred reanalysis data shows that the 
concentration obtained for the initial analysis and the concentration obtained by reanalysis was 
within 30% of their mean for at least 87.5% of the repeats. This is acceptable to use a method that 
has been validated for other disease types and in-line with EU guidance.

The PK and PD profiles of dupilumab were assessed in adult patients with CRSwNP who were 
inadequately controlled with INCS and had failed prior treatment with systemic corticosteroids 
and/or surgery. In the Phase 2a study ACT12340 and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 and 
EFC14280) for treatment periods ranged from 16 weeks to 52 weeks. A subcutaneous (SC) dosing 
regimen of 300 mg once every week (qw), following a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, was 
assessed in this Phase 2a study. Subsequently, the 300 mg once every 2 weeks (q2w) regimen 
without a loading dose was evaluated in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280, and the 300 mg once 
every 4 weeks (q4w) regimen was evaluated following 24 weeks of 300 mg q2w treatment in Study 
EFC14280.  
Pharmacokinetics 
In patients with CRSwNP, dupilumab is well-absorbed with an estimated subcutaneous (SC) 
bioavailability of 62.8%, distributes primarily within the vascular compartment (4.91 L) and 
exhibits non-linear target-mediated elimination. Based on Pop PK analysis, the median time to 
steady state was 16 weeks for 300 mg q2w. At steady state, the mean trough concentration was 
74.4 to 80.2 mg/L. In study EFC14280 following the switch to the 300 q4w dosing regimen at week 
24, a new steady state was achieved after additional 24 weeks. The mean trough concentration 
decreased from 75.5 mg/L at Week 24 to 17.6 mg/L at Week 52. The data show that the 
pharmacokinetic of dupilumab is similar in healthy subjects, CRSwNP, asthma, and AD patient 
populations. 
The proposed dose regimen by the applicant is 300 mg q2w for dupilumab. In the pivotal phase 3 
studies this dosing regimen demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvements with regards to the co-primary and the secondary efficacy endpoints. It was also 
demonstrated that continued dosing is necessary for maintenance of efficacy. In Study EFC14146 
in which benefits were lost when patients were removed from treatment compared to patients in 
study EFC14280 who continued on this regimen beyond Week 24 and showed sustained efficacy in 
most efficacy endpoints. The benefits were numerically greater for patients maintained on the 300 
mg q2w regimen beyond Week 24 compared to patients who switched to a 300 mg q4w regimen at 
Week 24 (Study EFC14280).  A descriptive exposure-efficacy analysis by quartile of dupilumab 
concentrations was conducted to examine the apparent correlation of the response with the trough 
concentrations. Over the narrow exposure range of 300 mg q2w at Week 24, there was no 
concentration-related increase in NPS and NC response. Over a wider exposure range of 300 mg 
q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w regimens pooled together, NPS improvement at Week 52 for the lowest 
exposure quartile (Q1) was numerically smaller than the other 3 quartiles of exposure. This 
suggests a greater efficacy for the 300 mg q2w regimen compared to the 300 mg q2w-q4w 
regimen since the majority of patients in Q1 (96%) received 300 mg q2w-q4w.  
In addition, TEAEs of sinusitis, headache, nasal polyps, and asthma were reported more frequently 
by patients after switching to the 300 mg q4w regimen at Week 24. The safety data support the 
efficacy and PK data indicating that the 300 mg q2w-q4w regimen may provide suboptimal disease 
control with regards to long term treatment compared to the 300 mg q2w regimen.  
Based on the CRSwNP Pop PK model-based post hoc estimates, cross study comparison of AUCτ,ss 
at steady state, mean AUCτ,ss were similar for 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw, indicating no major 
deviation from dose proportionality between 300 mg q2w to 300 mg qw and suggesting a 
saturation of the target-mediated elimination at doses of 300 mg q2w and higher.  
For the 300 mg q2w−q4w group, the PK profile was similar to 300 q2w group from baseline to 
Week 24. After the switch from the 300 mg q2w to 300 mg q4w dosing regimen at Week 24, mean 
trough concentration decreased from 75.5 mg/L at Week 24 to 17.6 mg/L at Week 52. The mean 
trough concentration increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at Week 52 (4.29-fold 
[17.6 versus 75.5 mg/L] for a 2-fold dose increase from 300 mg q4w to 300 mg q2w). Some 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

patients may not have reached full saturation of the target-mediated elimination at the steady-
state exposure of 300 mg q4w. Of note, more patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w regimen had 
steady-state concentrations at the end of the 52-week treatment that were below the limit of 
quantitation (0.078 mg/L) compared to the300 mg q2w regimen.  
Population PK Analyses 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in patients with CRSwNP was evaluated 
via Pop PK analysis. The CRSwNP Pop PK strategy involved the development of a global Pop PK 
base model first, with pooled data from healthy subjects and patients with AD and asthma patients 
(Study POH0668). This base model was then extended to allow the identification of covariates in a 
Pop PK model for the CRSwNP population using pooled data from Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 
studies in adult patients with CRSwNP (Study POH0611).  
Study POH0668 
The population PK analysis was conducted acceptably. A global Pop PK base model was developed, 
which  adequately  described  the  PK  of  functional  dupilumab  in  AD  and  asthma  patients  by  a  2-
compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination with first order absorption. 
Consistent with previous AD and asthma Pop PK models, and due to its notable effect on dupilumab 
PK,  body  weight  was  included  in  the  base  model  to  explain  between-subject  variability  of  steady 
state exposure of dupilumab in AD and asthma patients, which is acceptable. 
The model-simulated PK profiles were in good agreement with the observed PK profiles in AD and 
asthma populations, which support the predictability of this global Pop PK base model across a wide 
dose range for other type 2 inflammatory disease populations such as CRSwNP. 
Study POH0611 
Overall,  the  popPK  analysis  was  conducted  acceptably.  The  final  two-compartment  model  with 
parallel linear and nonlinear elimination with first order absorption adequately described the PK of 
dupilumab in adult patients with nasal polyposis (NP). PK parameters were estimated with acceptable 
precision. No systematic deviations or major bias in any of the goodness of fit plots were observed 
and the predictive performance of the model was acceptable based on bootstrap and VPCs. 
Body weight was found to be the primary source of dupilumab PK variability in the NP population. All 
other  covariates,  including  age,  gender,  race,  baseline  lab  parameters  (creatinine  clearance  and 
albumin), baseline biomarker (EoS), disease severity (NPS, NC, UPSIT), and ADA, were not found to 
have  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  dupilumab  PK  in  NP  patients.  Additionally,  concomitant 
medications  (intranasal  corticosteroid  spray  once  or  twice  a  day,  oral  corticosteroids,  systemic 
antihistamines, and allergen immunotherapy) and comorbidity with asthma were not found to have 
a significant effect on dupilumab PK based on post-hoc predicted exposures. The applicant claims 
that the apparent difference in PK exposures across age, race and CLCR groups is mainly explained 
by  the  difference  in  body  weight,  which  is  considered  plausible.  However,  the  impact  of  severely 
impaired  renal  and  hepatic  function  on  dupilumab  PK  is  not  known  and  the  existing  statements 
relating to this in Sections 4.2/5.2 of the SmPC are considered acceptable. The assessment of the 
impact of ADA was based on limited data, with most of the ADA positive responses being of low titer 
and very few of moderate or high titers. Consequently, the exposures in the few high titer patients 
were over-estimated by final NP Pop PK model (see below for further discussion on immunogenicity). 
The  impact  of  body  weight  on  dupilumab  steady  state  exposure  variables  was  assessed  using 
simulations. At the proposed dose of 300 mg q2w, exposures were ~60% higher and ~35% lower in 
patients weighing 53 kg and 110 kg, respectively, compared to a typical 79 kg patient. However, the 
highest and lowest weights in the data set were 150 kg and 38 kg, respectively, and, therefore, even 
greater differences in exposure are likely to be observed in patients at these extremes of weight.  
Further  clarification  it  was  considered  that  the  observed  changes  were  not  clinically  relevant  for 
adjustment of dosing regimen. 
Pharmacodynamics

EMA/547569/2019 
Page 82/238 
 
  
  
 
Across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 program in CRSwNP, blood levels of the type 2 inflammation 
biomarkers (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine [TARC], total IgE, eosinophil cationic 
protein [ECP], and periostin) were assessed as markers for disease activity/severity and to gain a 
better mechanistic understanding of dupilumab action. These same markers and eotaxin-3 were 
also assessed from nasal secretions to similarly gain an understanding of dupilumab's actions in the 
sino-nasal cavity. In addition, the dupilumab effect on leukotriene E4 (LTE4) in urine, a stable end 
product of the cysteinyl leukotriene pathway and a marker of activation of mast cells, involved in 
type 2 inflammation in patients with CRSwNP and NSAID-ERD, was explored. 
The concentration of these biomarkers declined during treatment with dupilumab, which was 
expected based on mechanism of action of dupilumab. There was a substantial reduction of TARC 
concentration in serum with dupilumab treatment, with maximum effect achieved at the first post-
baseline measurement and which was sustained over the treatment period for the 300 mg q2w and 
300 mg q2w-q4w regimens. Dupilumab suppression of total IgE gradually developed over time, 
with greater effect observed with longer treatment. These results support the effective blockage of 
IL-4/IL-13 mediated type 2 signalling via IL-4Rα by dupilumab in type 2 driven diseases. 
Concomitantly, reductions of eotaxin-3, total IgE, and ECP concentrations in nasal secretions were 
observed with dupilumab treatment, indicating a direct effect on type 2 biomarkers in the target 
sino-nasal tissue for CRSwNP. Urinary LTE4, a marker of mast cell activation involved in type 2 
inflammation, was suppressed by dupilumab treatment. In patients with NSAID-ERD, where LTE4 is 
particularly elevated, there was a marked decrease in urinary level as well. The reduction in 
biomarkers was already seen at the first assessment at Week 24 and was sustained through Week 
52 in patients on both dupilumab dosing regimens. 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationships 
The objectives of the empirical PK/PD analyses in this study were to understand dupilumab E-R 
relationships in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) with regard to the 
key efficacy endpoints, and to identify covariates influencing E-R relationships. The analysis was 
intended to support the proposed labeling dose regimen for dupilumab as add-on treatment in 
adult patients with severe CRSwNP who are inadequately controlled with intranasal corticosteroids. 
Descriptive as well as model-based E-R analyses were conducted using the trough concentration 
(Ctrough) of dupilumab for analyses of four efficacy endpoints, nasal polyps score (NPS), nasal 
congestion (NC), loss of sense of smell (LOSS) and 22-item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22), at 
Week 24 (pooled for the 2 pivotal studies, EFC14146 and EFC14280) and at Week 52 (Study 
EFC14280 only). 
Descriptive quartile analysis showed no exposure- related increase in NPS and NC response over 
the exposure range of 300 mg q2w at Week 24. Over a wider exposure range of 300 mg q2w and 
300 mg q2w-q4w regimens pooled together, improvement in NPS at Week 52 for the lowest 
exposure quartile was numerically smaller than the other three higher quartiles of exposure. 
However, similar analyses of other endpoints, NC, SNOT-22, LOSS did not show a clinically 
meaningful increase from the lowest exposure quartile to the other three higher quartiles of 
exposure at Week 52. 
Model-based analyses showed a sigmoidal Emax relationship between primary efficacy endpoint 
(NPS and NC, absolute change from baseline) and dupilumab Ctrough. E-R modeling of NPS 
indicated that the treatment effect approached, but did not reach Emax, at the exposure of 300 mg 
q2w-q4w and reached a plateau at the exposure of 300 mg q2w, supported by a numerically 
greater improvement in NPS for 300 mg q2w compared to 300 mg q2w-q4w at Week 52. For NC, 
the E-R relationship appeared flat over the concentration range studied.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 83/238 
 
  
  
 
Overall, the PK/PD analyses of key efficacy endpoints did not show a concentration-related increase 
in efficacy over a narrow range for 300 mg q2w, but did show a slight improvement in NPS 
response over a wider range of exposure combined for 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w. 
Immunogenicity 
The ADA response in CRSwNP patients was consistent with that observed for asthma and AD 
patients at the same dupilumab dose and treatment duration. 
Due to the different measurement time points and limited patient numbers in Study ACT12340, the 
pool of dupilumab 300 mg q2w arms in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 was the principal source 
of data to evaluate ADA responses in patients with CRSwNP with the same treatment duration (24 
weeks). The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 4.3% in the 300 mg q2w group compared 
to 2.1% in the placebo group. Persistent ADA response was seen in 1.6% of all patients at 300 mg 
q2w compared to 0.7% for placebo. Most of the treatment emergent ADA responses were low titer. 
High titer ADA response (>10 000) was observed in 0.9% of patients treated with dupilumab and 
was not observed in patients on placebo. Approximately 2.5% of all patients at 300 mg q2w were 
classified as neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive compared to 0.7% in the placebo group. The 
treatment-emergent ADA incidence was similar (2.1 to 4.8%) following dupilumab treatment for 24 
weeks (300 mg q2w in Study EFC14146) or 52 weeks (300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2−q4w in Study 
EFC14280) as well as placebo treatment (0.7% to 4.8% in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280). The 
ADA incidence was similar across the CRSwNP, AD, and asthma populations with respect to 
treatment emergent positive ADA response (5-6%), persistent ADA response (~2%), and 
neutralizing antibody response (1-3%) after 52 weeks of treatment at 300 mg q2w. 
The antibody titers detected in both dupilumab and placebo patients with CRSwNP were mostly low 
and did not correlate with clinically meaningful differences in dupilumab efficacy or safety, except 
for the rare cases where patients developed high-titer antibodies to dupilumab. In these patients 
lower dupilumab concentrations were observed and an effect on the results of the efficacy 
endpoints was seen.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Results of the PK/PD analyses are consistent with the efficacy evaluation in patients with CSRwNP. 
The totality of these data supports dupilumab 300 mg q2w as the more effective dose for long term 
treatment as an add-on treatment in adult patients with severe CRSwNP who are inadequately 
controlled with INCS. However, continued improvements through 52 weeks of treatment with both 
dosing regimens suggest that the maximal treatment effect had not been reached by the end of 
study EFC 14280. 
A descriptive exposure-efficacy analysis by quartile of dupilumab concentrations was conducted to 
examine the apparent correlation of the response with the trough concentrations. Over the narrow 
exposure range of 300 mg q2w at Week 24, there was no concentration-related increase in NPS 
and NC response. Over a wider exposure range of 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w regimens 
pooled together, NPS improvement at Week 52 for the lowest exposure quartile (Q1) was 
numerically smaller than the other 3 quartiles of exposure. This further supports the 300 mg q2w 
regimen compared to the 300 mg q2w-q4w regimen since the majority of patients in Q1 (96%) 
received 300 mg q2w-q4w. 
Therefore, the recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients with CRSwNP is an initial dose of 
300 mg followed by 300 mg given every other week. 
The ADA response in CRSwNP patients is consistent with that observed for asthma and AD patients 
at the same dupilumab dose and treatment duration.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose response study was performed in patients with nasal polyps.  
The dose regimens were selected based on the totality of clinical evidence in the dupilumab 
program including data from Phase 2 efficacy and safety study (ACT12340) in patients with nasal 
polyps and symptoms of chronic sinusitis, the result of Phase 2b dose ranging study in patients 
with moderate to severe asthma (DRI12544), the Phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) 
and phase 3 studies (R668-AD-1334 and R668-AD-1416) in patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD), as well as the supportive PK/pharmacodynamic [PD] analysis. 
In study ACT12340, 600 mg loading dose was followed by 300 mg given every week. The proposed 
dosing regimen and doses tested in pivotal studies deviates from the one that was tested in study 
ACT12340 (i.e. q2w instead of weekly dosing; no loading dose).  
The SNOT-22 results from 300mg q2w being used in asthma patients with NP as co-morbidity were 
discussed and used as a justification for the selected dose. In asthma dose ranging study 
(DRI12544), 300 mg q2w regimen demonstrated a robust treatment effect across all relevant 
indices of drug action, while a lower dose or a  less frequent regimen 200 mg q2w and 300mg q4w 
showed less effect in some endpoints including SNOT-22. 
The simulated concentration-time profiles for dupilumab in typical CRSwNP patients receiving 300 
mg q2w with or without a loading dose of 600 mg (-please see discussion in the PK section) 
confirmed that the absence of loading dose results in longer time to steady state, but does not 
impact the steady state level. In addition, PK/PD simulation of co-primary endpoints of NPS and NC 
showed minimal difference in the development of treatment effect and steady-state response of 
NPS and NC in the presence and absence of a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1. It is agreed that 
the lack of a loading dose is justified. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
There were two pivotal studies (EFC14280 and EFC 14146) submitted in this application and a 
supportive study (ACT12340). 
2.4.2.1.  Study EFC14146 
Title 
EFC14146: a pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating the effect of dupilumab 300 mg administered 
subcutaneously every 2 weeks (q2w) for 24 weeks in patients with CRSwNP on a background 
therapy of MFNS. 
Methods 
Study design 
Study EFC14146 was a randomized, 24-week treatment, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy 
and safety study of dupilumab 300 mg every other week, in patients with bilateral nasal polyposis 
on a background therapy with intranasal corticosteroids. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 85/238 
 
  
  
 
 
The study consisted of 3 periods:  a run-in period, a treatment period and a post treatment period.  
In the run-in period (4 weeks) patient’s eligibility was determined and the background intranasal 
corticosteroids were standardized prior to randomization. Patients were to receive MFNS, 2 
actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID; total daily dose of 400 μg starting at 
V1). In the randomized treatment period (24 weeks) patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
dupilumab SC q2w or placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w. Randomization was stratified by the 
presence of comorbid asthma and/or NSAID-ERD), prior NP surgery (yes or no), and country. 
Patients were to continue the stable dose of intranasal MFNS established during the run-in period 
except if the dose was changed due to an adverse event (AE). In the post treatment period (24 
weeks) patients were followed for 24 weeks to evaluate potential disease recurrence. 
Study participants 
276 patients with CRSwNP were randomized in this study (143 patients in the dupilumab treatment 
group and 133 patients in the placebo group).  
The target Phase 3 study populations consisted of patients 18 years and older with high CRSwNP 
disease burden (based on polyps score) and symptoms of NC and loss of smell or rhinorrhea for at 
least 12 weeks prior to randomization (8 weeks prior to screening) despite therapy with intranasal 
corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years or sino-nasal surgery. 
Randomization was stratified by asthma/NSAID-ERD status (yes/no), prior history of surgery for 
CRSwNP (yes/no), and country. Specific subgroup analyses were performed to assess efficacy in 
these subgroups in addition to the efficacy in the overall population.

Key inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study EFC14146 
These inclusion criteria were consistent with the definition Rhinosinusitis as per European Position 
Paper  on  Rhinosinusitis  and  Nasal  Polyps.  In  addition  the  Position  Paper  states:  Nasal  polyps  and 
chronic rhinosinusitis are often taken together as one disease entity, because it seems impossible to 
clearly  differentiate  between  them.  Nasal  Polyposis  is  therefore  considered  a  subgroup  of  Chronic 
Rhinosinusitis.  
Treatments 
All randomized patients received Dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w (2 mL) or Placebo matched to 
dupilumab 300 mg (2 mL) q2w SC. Every other week IMP administrations were separated by at 
least 11 days. 
Background treatment 
Mometasone furoate (NASONEX®) 50 micrograms (μg)/actuation nasal spray was provided by the 
Sponsor in a bottle with 18 g (140 actuations) of product formulation. The patients were to 
administer 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) of MFNS in each nostril twice daily (BID) (total daily dose 
of 400 μg) unless they were intolerant to the BID regimen or this dose was not approved in specific 
countries, in which case, they were to follow a once daily (QD) regimen.

Rescue treatment 
•  Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in case of acute infection). 
•  Short course SCS (prednisone or prednisolone up to 2 weeks).

Objectives 
The primary objective of study 14146 was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
compared to placebo on a background of MFNS in reducing NC/obstruction severity and endoscopic 
nasal polyps score (NPS) in patients with bilateral NP. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 88/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The secondary objectives included evaluation of the efficacy of dupilumab in improving total 
symptoms score (TSS), the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell, the efficacy of 
dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses, the ability of dupilumab to reduce the 
proportion of patients who require treatment with SCS or surgery for NP, the efficacy of dupilumab 
on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) and the effect of 
dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with prior surgery and comorbid asthma (including NSAID-
ERD). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There were two co-primary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline in nasal polyps score at Week 24 
The NPS was assessed by at least 2 physicians based on centrally read video recordings of 
nasal endoscopy. The score (NPS) was the sum of the right and left nostril scores (range 0 
to 8), as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. Nasal polyp score was graded based on 
polyp size in each nostril as described in the Table below. There is no established MCID for 
NPS. In a study using the same NPS as the current study, a short course of 
methylprednisolone resulted in a peak difference versus placebo of approximately -2.2 
points 
•  CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN NASAL CONGESTION/OBSTRUCTION (NC) 
Nasal congestion/obstruction was scored by the patient as a reflective score, evaluating the 
symptom severity over the past 24 hours. The NC score was to be recorded by the patient 
every morning in an e-diary, starting at screening and throughout the study, using the 
scale presented below. 
Secondary endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints (hierarchically ordered to account for multiplicity is shown in table 5): 
•  Change from baseline in LMK score at week 24 
•  Change from baseline in TSS at Week 24 
•  Change from baseline in smell test (UPSIT) at Week 24 
•  Change from baseline in loss of smell daily symptoms at Week 24 
•  Change from baseline in SNOT-22 at Week 24 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 89/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
•  Proportion of patients during study treatment receiving OCS for NP and/or planned to 
undergo surgery for nasal polyps 
Additional secondary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline and time course profiles in NPS, NC, LMK, TSS, UPSIT, daily 
assessed loss of smell, and SNOT-22 at Week 48, 
•  Change from baseline at Week 24 in: VAS for overall rhinosinusitis, NPIF, VAS for EQ-5D, 
and in the severity of rhinorrhea (anterior/posterior nasal discharge) daily symptom score 
assessed by the patient,  
•  Percentage change from baseline at Week 24 and time course profiles in: NC, Daily 
assessed loss of smell, TSS  
•  Percentage change from baseline at Week 24 in VAS for overall rhinosinusitis 
•  Proportion of responders at Week 24 (defined as patients with improvement by at least 1 
point in NPS),  
•  Proportion of responders at Week 24 (defined as patients with improvement by at least 2 
points in NPS),  
•  Proportion of patients with improvement by at least 1 point in NPS and 0.5 reductions in NC 
at Week 24 and Week 48,  
•  Proportion of patients with greater than or equal to the minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID)(≥8.9) in SNOT-22 at Week 24,  
•  Proportion of patients with overall rhinosinusitis severity VAS ≤7 at Week 24, 
•  The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of change from baseline in NC, NPS, SNOT-22 
and VAS for rhinosinusitis severity at Week 24,  
•  Proportion of patients with anosmia by UPSIT scores at Week 24. 
Sample size 
The sample size was chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the difference in efficacy 
between dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo with regard to the 2 co-primary endpoints, changes 
from baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24. With a sample size of 120 patients per group, the 
combined power of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints was at least 93% for dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the 2 endpoints. 
The observed mean NC reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 0.95 and 
the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To calculate the power, a 
conservative estimate is used that assumes the placebo adjusted NC reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is 80% of the effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg qw. Thus, the mean NC 
reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w is then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 * (0.95 – 0.26) + 0.26 
at Week 24. Assuming normal distribution of the change in NC, a common standard deviation (SD) 
of 1.03, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% 
dropout rate, with 120 patients per group, the study will have 95% power to detect an effect size 
of 0.534 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus placebo. 
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 1.85 and 
the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group is 0.30. Using the same conservative 
approach that assumes the placebo adjusted NPS reduction with the dupilumab 300 mg q2w is 
80% of the effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is then assumed to be 1.54 = 0.8 * (1.85 – 0.30) + 0.30. Assuming normal 
distribution of the change in NPS, a common SD of 2.11, which has incorporated a 20% inflation 
from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 120 patients per group, the 
study will have 98% power to detect an effect size of 0.588 using a two-sided test with alpha=0.05 
for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus placebo.

Randomisation 
Patients who meet the entry criteria were be randomized to one of the following treatment arms 
using a 1:1 randomization ratio: 
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w until Week 24. 
• Arm B: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w until Week 24. 
A total of 240 (120 patients/arm) patients was planned to be randomized. Randomization was to 
be stratified based on asthma status (history of asthma or not), prior surgery (yes or no) and 
country. In order to have adequate number of patients for the subgroup analysis of patients with 
asthma/NERD and prior surgery enrolment of the following categories of patients were limited as 
follows (see rationale Section 4.2): 
• Patients without asthma and/or NERD history will be limited to 120 patients (out of the total 240 
randomized patients). 
• Patients without prior surgery will be limited to 120 patients (out of the total 240 randomized 
patients). 
Blinding (masking) 
Dupilumab and placebo will be provided in identically matching 2 mL prefilled syringes. To protect 
the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL (dupilumab/placebo) glass prefilled syringes will be prepared 
such that the treatments (dupilumab and its matching placebo according to its dose) are identical 
and indistinguishable and will be labelled with a treatment kit number. The randomized treatment 
kit number list will be generated by Sanofi. Both the patient and Investigator will be blinded to 
assigned active drug or placebo for the whole study period. Study patients, Investigators, and 
study site personnel will not have access to the randomization code list except under 
circumstances. 
Statistical methods 
The baseline value of efficacy parameters was defined as the last available value up to 
randomization but prior to the first dose of IMP, unless otherwise specified. 
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints included the randomized ITT population 
which includes all patients who were allocated to a randomized treatment regardless of whether 
the treatment kit was used or not. The efficacy analyses were conducted according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized. 
Primary statistical model (ITT analysis) 
Each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints was analysed using a hybrid method of the worst-
observation carried forward (WOCF) and multiple imputation (MI). Data collected after treatment 
discontinuation were included in the analysis. The imputed completed data were analysed by fitting 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value of the corresponding co-primary 
endpoint, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as 
covariates. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data was combined using Rubin’s rule. 
Supportive and sensitivity analysis 
For all sensitivity analyses, except for the as-observed analysis, for patients who underwent 
surgery for NP or received SCS for any reason, data collected post-surgery or post SCS were be set 
to missing. The sensitivity analyses are summarized below.  
−  Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach: The model included change 
from baseline values up to week 24 as response variables, and factors (fixed effects) for 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 91/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
treatment, stratification factor (comorbid asthma/NSAID-ERD, prior surgery, region), visit, 
treatment-by-visit interaction, NPS/NC baseline value and baseline-by-visit interaction. No 
imputation was performed for the MMRM model. 
−  Pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo: Each of the 2 co-primary efficacy 
endpoints (3 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Japan) were analysed with imputed missing 
value at 24 weeks using pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo (34). 
This copy increment from placebo implies that when subjects discontinue treatment early, 
they continue to take advantage of their previous therapy, but they progress in the same 
way as subjects in the placebo group. The imputed dataset was analysed by fitting an 
ANCOVA model same as the one in primary analysis. 
−  Tipping point analysis: Each of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (3 co-primary efficacy 
endpoints for Japan) were analysed with imputed missing value at 24 weeks. 
−  As-observed analysis: An additional analysis was conducted on the co-primary efficacy 
endpoints which included all data (including that collected after SCS for any reason and/or 
treatment discontinuation) but excluded post NP surgery data. The data were analysed in 
the same ANCOVA model for the primary approach. 
−  Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach for NC as binary response 
data: In the primary analysis, NC was analysed as the average of 28-day NC data. To 
assess the robustness of this approach, an MMRM approach on NC as longitudinal binary 
response data was performed based on methods proposed and evaluated by Fan. 
−  Subgroup analyses: To assess the consistency in treatment effects across different 
subgroup levels, subgroup analyses were conducted for the co-primary efficacy endpoints 
with respect to age, gender, region, territory, race, ethnicity, baseline weight, baseline 
BMI, prior NP surgery, asthma comorbidity and/or NSAID-ERD, and SCS use in the prior 2 
years.  
Analysis of key secondary endpoints 
The change from baseline in sinus opacification CT scan score (LMK), TSS, UPSIT score, daily loss 
of smell, and SNOT-22 at Week 24 were assessed for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (Arm A) versus 
placebo (Arm B) and were analysed using the hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in the same 
way as the primary approach of the co-primary endpoints. (Note: LMK was a co-primary and not a 
secondary endpoint for Japan). 
Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment (defined as use of SCS or NP surgery during the 
treatment period) was derived and analysed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The 
decision date of NP surgery or the first SCS intake date was used as the event date, or whichever 
was earlier if both occurred. 
Due to the potentially low predicted number of patients requiring rescue treatment, the primary 
analysis for this endpoint was conducted by pooling the 2 Phase 3 CRSwNP studies, ie, the current 
study and Study EFC14280. 
The change from baseline in FEV1 at Week 24 was assessed in patients with asthma. The analysis 
was conducted by pooling the 2 CRSwNP studies (the current study and Study EFC14280). The 
missing data in FEV1 at Week 24 was imputed using the hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in 
the same way as the primary approach of the co-primary endpoints. The results of the pooled 
analysis are provided in Module 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy, and the results of the analyses 
from the individual studies are provided in the respective CSRs.

Multiplicity issues 
A hierarchical testing procedure was prespecified to control the overall type-I error rate for testing 
the co-primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha was 0.05. The comparisons 
with placebo were tested based on the hierarchical order in Table 5 at 2-sided α = 0.05. 
Results (study EFC14146) 
Participant flow 
506 patients were screened of which 230 (45.5%) were classified as screen failures. The leading 
reasons for screen failure were failure to meet the inclusion criterion of a minimum score of 5 
points on the bilateral NPS (22.7%), failure to meet the inclusion criteria for ongoing symptoms 
with a NC score of 2 or 3 and another symptom (6.1%), and noncompliance with the NIMP at Visit

2 (5.9%). Of the remaining 276 patients, 143 patients were randomized to dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
and 133 were randomized to placebo. Overall, 263 patients completed 24 weeks of study 
treatment. Twelve (4.3%) patients discontinued from the study treatment prior to Week 24 and 1 
patient did not receive any study treatment. In general, study treatment discontinuation rates were 
higher in the placebo group (5.3%) compared to the dupilumab group (3.5%) with AEs as primary 
reason for discontinuation. Treatment exposure was similar between treatment groups, with a 
mean exposure of 164.56 days in the dupilumab group versus 163.39 days in the placebo group. 
There were 10 (7.0%) and 25 (18.8%) patients with first rescue with either SCS or surgery prior to 
Week 24 in the dupilumab group and the placebo group, respectively.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
29.4% of patients in the dupilumab group and 42.9% of patients in the placebo group had a 
deviation considered critical or major. The most frequently occurring of these deviations were 
deviations in the schedule of assessments or procedures (eg, a study visit or phone call not 
performed or performed outside of the visit window) occurring in 21.0% and 33.1% of patients in 
the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively and deviations in IMP management (eg, missed 
IMP dose, or IMP administered but not per protocol) occurring in 7.0% and 9.8% of patient in the 
dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
A subset of critical or major deviations that could potentially impact efficacy analyses were 
identified. These included failure to meet the inclusion criteria or violation of exclusion criteria 
related to the co-primary efficacy endpoints, use of prohibited concomitant medications that 
interfere with the primary analysis approach on SCS rescue, missing co-primary efficacy endpoint 
assessments, or noncompliance or randomization procedures that result in <80% compliance with 
the IMP). These critical or major deviations that could potentially impact the efficacy analyses were 
reported for a small percentage of patients in both the dupilumab and placebo groups (3.5% 
versus 3.0%, respectively). 
The most common type of major protocol deviations potentially impacting efficacy analyses was 
the allowance of a patient to stay in the study until after Week 24 even with a missing NC score 
between Weeks 21 and 24 (reported in 2 patients [1.4%] in the dupilumab group versus 3 patients 
[2.3%] in the placebo group). The second most common type of major protocol deviations 
potentially impacting efficacy analyses was failure to meet the inclusion criterion requiring ongoing 
symptoms for at least 8 weeks before randomization (reported in 2 patients [1.4%] in the 
dupilumab group and 1 patient [0.8%] in the placebo group). The critical/major protocol deviations 
potentially impacting efficacy were observed across all treatment groups, with no apparent 
distribution pattern.

Similar protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses were made in both studies. 
These changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on the study results.  In both studies a 
number of patients had a deviation considered critical or major (Study EFC14146: 29.4% of 
patients in the dupilumab group and 42.9% of patients in the placebo group, Study  EFC14280: 
38.7% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 40.7% of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w 
group, and 49.7% of patients in the placebo group). 
Baseline data 
The mean time since first diagnosis of CRSwNP was 11.11 years and ranged from 0.2 to 42.5 
years. Baseline mean NPS of 5.75 (out of maximum of 8), mean NC severity score of 2.35 (out of a 
maximum score of 3), mean SNOT-22 total score of 49.4 (out of maximum possible score of 110), 
mean UPSIT score of 14.56 (indicating anosmia [score of 0 to 18, out of a maximum score of 39]), 
and mean TSS of 7.04 (out of a maximum score of 9) are suitable for patients with severe 
CRSwNP. CT-scan evaluation demonstrated that most patients had extensive opacification of the 
sinuses bilaterally as assessed by the CT scan LMK total mean score of 19.03 (maximum possible 
score of 24). 73% of the patients had at least partial opacification of all sinuses. The mean VAS for 
rhinosinusitis was 7.68 (severe disease >7 to 10) and mean loss of smell at baseline of 2.71 
(maximum score of 3).

In the 2 years prior to randomization, 179 (64.9%) patients received at least one course of SCS. 
71.7% patients had a sino-nasal surgery prior to randomization. Of these, 45.5% had 1 surgery 
and 54.5% of patients had 2 or more previous surgeries. The mean time since the most recent 
sino-nasal surgery was 5.74 years (ranging from 0.6 to 34.5 years). 58.3% had a medical history 
of asthma and 30.4% patients had a history of NSAID-ERD. 88.8% of the patients with asthma 
were on asthma medication in the prior year and 76.7% were using ICS and LABA. 75.4% had a 
medical history of at least 1 type 2 inflammation mediated disease. The incidence of patients with 
each type 2 inflammation mediated comorbidities was similar among treatment groups.

The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between dupilumab and 
placebo groups. Overall, the literature suggests that CRSwNP increases with age, with a mean 
onset across all ethnic groups of 42 years. CRSwNP is uncommon under the age of 20 years and 
occurs more frequently in men than in women; aspirin-sensitive patients, however, are more likely 
to be women.

Responder Analysis at Week 24 
A higher percentage of patients had a ≥1 point improvement in NPS in the dupilumab group 
compared with the placebo (65.0% versus 17.3%, nominal p<0.0001). Similarly, the proportion of 
patients showing a ≥2 points improvement in NPS was greater in the dupilumab group compared 
with the placebo group (46.2 % versus 4.5%, nominal p<0.0001). 
•  CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN NASAL CONGESTION/OBSTRUCTION (NC) 
Nasal congestion/obstruction was assessed by the patient daily basis using a 0 to 3 categorical 
scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms, and 3 = severe 
symptoms) as a reflective assessment using a 24-hour recall period.

KEY SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
•  Sinus opacification CT scan score (Lund-Mackay score) 
A range of staging systems for CT scanning have been described, the most commonly used being 
the Lund-Mackay system. This system relies on a score of 0–2 dependent on the absence, partial, 
or complete opacification of each sinus system and of the vital ostiomeatal complex deriving a 
maximum score of 12 per side. This has been validated but the correlation between the CT score 
and symptoms has been shown to be poor and is not a good indicator of outcome. 
Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
The dupilumab 300 mg q2w group showed a statistically significant improvement in the mean sinus 
opacification CT scan score (LMK) compared with placebo receiving INCS who showed minimal 
changes in sinus disease at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo: -
7.44 with 95% CI: -8.35 to -6.53; p<0.0001).

ITT population 
Mean change from baseline in sinus opacification CT scan score (Lund-Mackay score) by visit up to Week 24 - 
ITT population 
Change from baseline to Week 24 on left and right side and by individual sinus 
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated improvements in mean sinus opacification CT scan score 
(LMK) from baseline to Week 24 on both the left and right sides compared with the placebo (LS 
mean difference versus placebo [95% CI] was -3.56 [-4.06 to -3.06] for the left side and -3.92 [-
4.41 to -3.42] for the right side; nominal p<0.0001 for each side. Consistent with its systemic 
effect in the type 2 inflammation, dupilumab demonstrated improvements in mean sinus 
opacification CT scan score (LMK) compared with placebo at Week 24 across all individual sinuses 
bilaterally, indicating that the effect of dupilumab in total LMK score was obtained through 
reduction of the inflammation in multiple sinuses and was not only driven by the shrinkage of the 
polyps in the nasal cavity.  
The results for the sensitivity analyses were similar to those of the primary WOCF/MI analysis.

During the follow up period, treatment effect in sinus opacification CT scan score (LMK) diminished 
without rebound in the dupilumab group after treatment discontinuation, with an LS mean 
difference versus placebo of -1.79 at Week 48. 
•  Disease specific daily symptom assessment and total symptom score (TSS) 
The TSS is a composite score consisting of the sum of the symptoms scores for NC, decreased/loss 
of sense of smell, and rhinorrhea on a 0-3 scale (maximum of 9). 
Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
Dupilumab displayed a statistically significant improvement in mean TSS compared with placebo at 
Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo: -2.61 with 95% CI: -3.04 to 
-2.17; p<0.0001).  
Change from baseline in TSS at Week 24 - ITT population 
The improvement in TSS score was rapid with an onset of a difference vs placebo observed as early 
as the first post-baseline monthly average score at Week 4 with an LS mean change from baseline 
to Week 4 of -1.34 for the dupilumab group and -0.35 for the placebo group (LS mean difference 
versus placebo: -0.98 with 95% CI: -1.22 to -0.74; p<0.0001). 
Analysis through 24-week follow-up 
During the 24 week off-treatment follow up period, the improvement in the TSS diminished without 
rebound in the dupilumab group after treatment discontinuation, with an LS mean difference 
versus placebo of -1.60 at Week 36 and -0.77 at Week 48.

•  Smell test: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
The UPSIT was 40 odorant test administered at the study site. Each patient received a score 
ranging from 0 to 40 possible correct answers with the lowest score representing the most severe 
loss of smell. Anosmia categories were as follows: 0 to 18 = anosmia, 19 to 25 = severe 
microsmia, 26 to 30 = moderate microsmia, 31 to 34 = mild microsmia, and 35 to 40 = normal. 
At baseline, the majority of patients presented with anosmia as demonstrated by median scores of 
11.00 and 12.00 for the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w displayed a statistically significant improvement in mean UPSIT score 
compared with placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo: 
10.56 with 95% CI: 8.79 to 12.34) (p<0.0001). The improvement was rapid, noted as early as 
assessment at Week 2 with an LS mean change from baseline to Week 2 of 7.04 for the dupilumab 
group and 1.41 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: 5.63 with 95% CI: 3.83 
to 7.42; p<0.0001), and continued through Week 24. At Baseline the vast majority of patients 
(74.3%) in EFC14146 were anosmic with the UPSIT score of ≤18 at baseline. The proportion of 
patients with anosmia at Week 24 was reduced from 74.3% at baseline to 23.9% in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group versus almost no changes in the placebo group (78.2% at baseline and 77.7% 
at Week 24). 
Analysis through the 24-week follow-up period 
During the follow up period, UPSIT treatment effect diminished without rebound in the dupilumab 
group after treatment discontinuation.

•  Loss of smell 
The loss of sense of smell severity was reported by the patient on a daily basis using a 0 to 3 
categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = 
severe symptoms). 
Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
A statistically significant improvement in mean daily assessed sense of smell was seen for the 
dupilumab group compared with placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group 
versus placebo: -1.12, 95% CI: -1.31 to -0.93; p<0.0001). The improvement was rapid with an 
onset of a difference versus placebo observed at Week 4 and showed continued progressive 
improvement through Week 24.  
Analysis through the 24-week follow-up period 
After treatment discontinuation the effect on loss of smell diminished without rebound.

•  22-Item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) 
The SNOT-22 has 22 items applicable to sino-nasal conditions and surgical treatments, and each 
item is scored on a scale from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be). The range of the 
global score was 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.

Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean SNOT-22 
compared with placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo: -
21.12 with 95% CI: -25.17 to -17.06; p<0.0001). A substantial difference versus placebo in the 
improvement in SNOT-22 was observed as early as Week 8 with an LS mean change from baseline 
to Week 8 of -26.62 for the dupilumab group and -9.90 for the placebo group (LS mean difference 
versus placebo: -16.71 with 95% CI: -20.44 to -12.99; p<0.0001). The SNOT-22 total score 
showed continued gradual improvement through Week 24.  
Analysis through the 24-week follow-up period 
During the follow up period, SNOT-22 total score treatment effect diminished without rebound in 
the dupilumab group after treatment discontinuation. 
•  Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment 
The proportion of patients who required rescue treatment with SCS or NP surgery during the 
treatment period was lower in the dupilumab group compared to placebo during the 24 week 
treatment period (Kaplan-Meier estimate of 7.2% versus 23.3%, with a hazard ratio [95% CI] of 
0.268 [0.131 to 0.549], nominal p=0.0003).

b) Study EFC14280 
Title 
EFC14280: a pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating the effect of dupilumab 300 mg administered 
subcutaneously q2w for 52 weeks, or q2w for 24 weeks followed by every 4 weeks (q4w) 
administration to Week 52, in patients with CRSwNP on a background therapy of MFNS. 
Methods 
Study design 
EFC14280 was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 placebo-controlled, 
parallel arm study to evaluate dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP. 
The clinical trial consisted of the following 3 periods. In the run-in period (4 weeks) patient’s 
eligibility was determined and the background intranasal corticosteroids were standardised. 
Patients were to receive MFNS, 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID; total 
daily dose of 400 μg). At visit 2 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 treatment groups: 
Group A receiving dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52; Group B receiving dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w SC until Week 24 then switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w until Week 52 and Group C 
receiving placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52. In the randomized 
treatment period (52 weeks) patients were to continue the stable dose of intranasal MFNS 
established during the run-in period except if the dose was changed due to an adverse event (AE). 
Following the EOT at week 52 was the Posttreatment period (12 weeks). 
Study participants 
A total of 448 patients with CRSwNP were randomized in this study. 295 patients were randomized 
to dupilumab 300 mg (pool of Arm A+B) with 150 patients randomized to dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
(Arm A) and 145 patients randomized to dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w (Arm B). One hundred and 
fifty three (153) patients were randomized to placebo. Of the 448 patients randomized, 418 
patients completed the first 24 weeks of study treatment. A total of 29 patients discontinued from 
the study treatment prior to Week 24 (12.4% in placebo versus 3.4% in the dupilumab group) and 
1 patient did not receive any study treatment.

•  Key inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study EFC14280  
Treatments 
Patients in this study were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 treatment arms: 
A.  dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52 
B.  dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 24 then switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w until 
Week 52 
C.  placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52 
Randomization was stratified according to asthma status (history of asthma or not), prior NP 
surgery (yes or no), and country.  
Intranasal corticosteroid background therapy  
Mometasone furoate (NASONEX®) 50 micrograms (μg)/actuation nasal spray was provided by the 
Sponsor in a bottle with 18 g (140 actuations) of product formulation. The patients were to administer 
2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) of MFNS in each nostril twice daily (BID) (total daily dose of 400 μg) 
unless they were intolerant to the BID regimen or this dose was not approved in specific countries, 
in which case, they were to follow a once daily (QD) regimen. 
Rescue treatment 
•  Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in case of acute infection). 
•  Short course SCS (prednisone or prednisolone up to 2 weeks). 
•  Sino-nasal surgery for nasal polyps. Based on previous observations from the POC study, 8 
weeks of IMP treatment was recommended prior to surgery to allow onset of treatment effect.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 
weeks compared to placebo on a background of MFNS in reducing nasal congestion 
(NC)/obstruction severity and endoscopic nasal polyposis score (NPS) in patients with bilateral 
nasal polyposis (NP).  
The secondary objectives included evaluation of the efficacy of dupilumab in improving total 
symptoms score (TSS), the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell, the efficacy of 
dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses, the ability of dupilumab to reduce the 
proportion of patients who require treatment with SCS or surgery for NP, the efficacy of dupilumab 
on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) and the effect of 
dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with prior surgery and comorbid asthma (including NSAID-
ERD). 
Outcomes/endpoints

There were two co-primary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline in nasal polyps score at Week 24 
The NPS was assessed by at least 2 physicians based on centrally read video recordings of 
nasal endoscopy. The score (NPS) was the sum of the right and left nostril scores (range 0 
to 8), as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. Nasal polyp score was graded based on 
polyp size in each nostril as described in the Table below. There is no established MCID for 
NPS. In a study using the same NPS as the current study, a short course of 
methylprednisolone resulted in a peak difference versus placebo of approximately -2.2 
points 
•  Change from baseline in the nasal congestion/obstruction at Week 24 
Nasal congestion/obstruction was scored by the patient as a reflective score, evaluating the 
symptom severity over the past 24 hours. The NC score was to be recorded by the patient 
every morning in an e-diary, starting at screening and throughout the study, using the 
scale presented below.

symptom score assessed by the patient, 
o  Proportion of responders at Week 24 (defined as patients with improvement by at 
least 1 point in NPS), 
o  Proportion of patients with improvement by at least 1 point in NPS and 0.5 
reductions in NC at Week 24 and Week 52,

Sample size 
The sample size was chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the efficacy between 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) and placebo with regard to the 2 co-primary 
endpoints, changes from baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24. 
The observed mean NC reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 0.95 and 
the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To calculate power, a conservative 
estimate was used that assumes the placebo-adjusted NC reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group is 80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw group, the mean NC reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group was then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 * (0.95-0.26) + 0.26. Assuming normal distribution 
of the change in NC, a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.03, which has incorporated a 20% 
inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the 
q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 
0.534 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group. 
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 1.85 and 
the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group is 0.30. Using same conservative approach 
that assumes the placebo-adjusted NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% of 
the dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group was then 
assumed to be 1.54 = 0.8*(1.85-0.30)+0.30. Assuming normal distribution of the change in NPS, 
a common standard deviation (SD) of 2.11, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the 
observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 
patients in placebo, the study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.588 using a two-
sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group. Therefore, with a sample size of 240 patients for the q2w pool ( Arm A and B) at Week 24, 
the combined power of the two co-primary efficacy endpoints is at least 98% for dupilumab 300mg 
q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the 2 endpoints. 
Randomisation 
Approximately 360 patients were to be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 treatment groups as follows: 
•  Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 117/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
•  Arm B: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 24 then switched to dupilumab 300 mg 
q4w until Week 52. 
•  Arm C: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52. 
• 
Randomization was stratified according to asthma status (history of asthma or not), prior NP 
surgery (yes or no), and country  
Blinding (masking) 
Dupilumab and placebo were provided in identically matching 2 mL prefilled syringes. To protect 
the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL glass prefilled syringes was prepared such that the 
treatments (dupilumab and its matching placebo) were identical and indistinguishable, and each kit 
was labeled with a treatment kit number. The randomized treatment kit number list was generated 
by the Sponsor. Both the patient and Investigator were blinded to assigned active drug or placebo 
for the entire study period. In addition, to prevent differentiation between the q2w and q4w dosing 
regimens, after Week 24 dupilumab administration for Arm B was alternated with a placebo 
matched injection every other week. Study patients, Investigators, and study site personnel did not 
have access to the randomization codes unless immediate unblinding was necessary to protect 
patient safety in an emergency. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the randomized ITT population 
which includes all patients who have been allocated to a randomized treatment regardless of 
whether the treatment kit was used or not. The efficacy analyses will be conducted according to 
the treatment to which they were randomized. 
Primary statistical model (ITT analysis) 
Each of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (3 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Japan) will be 
analysed using a hybrid method of the worst-observation carried forward (WOCF) and multiple 
imputation. Data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included in the analysis. With this 
approach, for patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data collected 
postsurgery (actual date) or post SCS will be set to missing, and the worst post-baseline value on 
or before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to impute missing Week 24 value (for patients 
whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will be used to impute). For patients who 
discontinue the treatment without being rescued by surgery or receiving SCS, a multiple 
imputation approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value, and this multiple imputation 
will use all patients who have not been rescued by surgery or receiving SCS at Week 24. Each of 
the imputed complete data will be analysed by fitting an ANCOVA model with the baseline value of 
the corresponding co-primary endpoint, treatment group, asthma/NERD status, prior surgery 
history, and regions as covariates. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data will be 
combined using Rubin’s rule. Descriptive statistics including number of patients, mean, standard 
error, and least squares (LS) means will be provided. In addition, difference in LS means and the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be provided along with the p-values. 
Sensitivity analyses 
For all sensitivity analyses, except for the as-observed analysis, for patients who underwent 
surgery for NP or received SCS for any reason, data collected post-surgery or post SCS were be set 
to missing. The sensitivity analyses are summarized below. 
•  Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach: The model included 
change from baseline values up to Week 24 as response variables, and factors (fixed 
effects) for treatment, stratification factor, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, 
NPS/NC baseline value and baseline-by-visit interaction. Data collected after 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 118/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
treatment discontinuation was included in the analysis. No imputation was performed 
for the MMRM model. 
•  Pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo: Each of the co-primary 
efficacy endpoints was analysed with imputed missing values at Week 24 using 
pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo (34). This copy increment 
from placebo implied that when patients discontinued treatment early, they continued 
to take advantage of their previous therapy, but they progressed in the same way as 
patients in the placebo group. The imputed dataset was analysed by fitting an 
ANCOVA model as for the primary analysis.  
•  Tipping point analysis: Each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints was subject to a 
tipping point analysis with imputed missing value at Week 24. 
•  As-observed analysis: An additional analysis was conducted on the co-primary 
efficacy endpoints which included all data (including that collected after SCS for any 
reason and/or treatment discontinuation) but excluded post NP surgery data. The 
data were analysed in the same ANCOVA model for the primary approach.  
•  Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach for NC as binary 
response data: In the primary analysis, NC was analyzed as the average of 28-day NC 
data. To assess the robustness of this approach, an MMRM approach on NC as 
longitudinal binary response data was performed based on methods proposed and 
evaluated by Fan (35). 
Multiplicity issues 
A hierarchical testing procedure was prespecified to control the overall type-I error rate for testing 
the co-primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha was 0.05. The comparisons 
with placebo were tested based on the hierarchical order in Table 5 at 2-sided α = 0.05.

Results 
Participant flow 
806 patients signed the written informed consent and were screened for study eligibility. 448 
patients were enrolled, for a screen failure rate of 44.4%. The leading reasons for screen failure 
were failure to meet the inclusion criterion of a minimum score of 5 points on the bilateral NPS, 
failure to meet the inclusion criteria for ongoing symptoms with an NC score of 2 or 3 and another 
symptom and noncompliance with the NIMP at Visit 2.  
A total of 150 patients were randomized to Arm A and 145 patients were randomized to Arm B. 
153 patients were randomized to Arm C for 52 weeks. One patient was randomized to the placebo 
group but did not receive treatment. Study treatment discontinuation prior to Week 24 occurred at 
a lower rate in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (10 [3.4%] patients and 19 
[12.4%] patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo groups, respectively). 398 patients 
completed 52 weeks of treatment with the study medication. Treatment discontinuation rates were 
lower in the dupilumab groups compared with the placebo group (8.7% and 3.4% patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2wq4w groups, respectively, and 20.3% patients in the 
placebo group). 15 patients had a surgery during the study treatment (2 patients in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group, 1 patient in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 12 patients in the placebo 
group). 
The description above is based on the data from the initially submitted CSR and is unchanged as 
the treatment period of all non-discontinued patients was completed at the time of the initial data 
cut-off date. At that time, 428 patients had completed the 52-week treatment period with or 
without study medication, with 159 patients having completed the whole study period, and 260 
patients still in the post-treatment follow-up period. All patients have since completed the study.

Recruitment 
The cut-off for data included in the CSR was the date when the last patient completed the last 
treatment visit (29 August 2018). At the time of this data cut-off, some patients were still in the 
posttreatment period. The data collected after the cut-off date were submitted in an addendum 
with the responses to the 1st RSI. 
Conduct of the study 
•  Amendments 
One global amendment was made to the study protocol: 
• 
Protocol deviations 
38.7% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 40.7% of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w 
group, and 49.7% of patients in the placebo group had a deviation. The most frequently occurring 
included deviations in the schedule of assessments or procedures (eg, a study visit or phone call 
not performed or performed outside of the visit window) occurring in 15.9% to 24.8% of patients 
and deviations in IMP management (eg, missed IMP dose, or IMP administered but not per 
protocol) occurring in 15.3% to 21.6% of patients.  
Critical or major deviations that could potentially impact efficacy analyses were identified by the 
applicant. These included failure to meet the inclusion criteria or violation of exclusion criteria 
related to the co-primary efficacy endpoints, use of prohibited concomitant medications that 
interfere with the primary analysis approach on SCS rescue, missing co-primary efficacy endpoint 
assessments, or noncompliance or randomization procedures that result in <80% compliance with

the IMP). The numbers reported were small with 5 (3.3%) in the 300 mg q2w group and 6 (4.1%) 
patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group and 9 (5.9%) patients in the placebo group.  
Similar protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses were made in both studies. These 
changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on the study results.  In both studies a number 
of patients had a deviation considered critical or major (Study EFC14146: 29.4% of patients in the 
dupilumab group and 42.9% of patients in the placebo group, Study  EFC14280: 38.7% of patients 
in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 40.7% of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 49.7% 
of patients in the placebo group). 
Baseline data 
Patients enrolled in this study had severe CRSwNP disease as reflected by baseline mean NPS of 
6.10 (maximum of 8), mean NC symptom score of 2.43 (maximum of 3), mean SNOT-22 total 
score of 51.86 (maximum possible score 110), mean UPSIT score of 13.61 (indicating anosmia 
score of 0 to 18, maximum score of 40]) and mean TSS of 7.22 (maximum of 9). The mean AS for 
rhinosinusitis was 8.0 (severe disease >7) and mean loss of smell at baseline was 2.75 (maximum 
score of 3). Upon CT-scan evaluation, most patients had extensive opacification of the sinuses 
bilaterally as assessed by the LMK total mean score of 17.96 (maximum of 24). The majority of 
patients (90%) had at least partial opacification of all sinuses. The mean blood eosinophil count at 
baseline was high (0.43 Giga/L). The mean time since first diagnosis of CRSwNP was 10.94 years 
and ranged from 0.1 to 61.3 years. The mean age of onset was 41.06 years.

80.1% of the patients received at least one course of SCS in the 2 years prior to randomization. 
96.9% of patients had either SCS in past two years or prior surgery for nasal polyp. 59.6% of 
patients had a history of asthma and 26.8% had a history of NSAID-ERD. 82.4% had a medical 
history of at least 1 comorbid type 2 inflammatory disease. The incidence of patients with each 
type 2 inflammatory condition was similar among treatment groups.

CO-PRIMARY ENDPOINTS 
•  CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN NASAL POLYPOSIS SCORE (NPS)  
Primary analysis: Change from baseline in nasal polyps score at Week 24 
The results show a statistically significant improvement in the mean bilateral endoscopic NPS 
compared with placebo at Week 24, with an LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 of -1.71 for 
the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and +0.10 for the placebo group (LS mean 
difference versus placebo: -1.80 with 95% CI: -2.10 to -1.51; p<0.0001). The onset of

improvement was seen at week4 with an LS mean change from baseline to Week 4 of -1.11 for the 
300 mg q2w dupilumab group [pooled Arm A+B] and +0.05 for the placebo group (LS mean 
difference versus placebo: -1.15 with 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.91; nominal p<0.0001). The NPS 
showed progressive improvement through Week 24. 
Primary approach: change from baseline in bilateral nasal polyps score (NPS) at Week 24 - ITT population

dupilumab [Arm A] group versus placebo: -2.40 with 95% CI: -2.77 to -2.02; p<0.0001). The LS 
mean difference in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group versus placebo at Week 52 was greater than 
that observed at Week 24, indicating a continued improvement through 52 weeks.  
Change from baseline in bilateral nasal polyps score (NPS) at Week 52 - ITT population 
A greater numerical improvement was seen in NPS in patients who stayed on dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w compared with the patients who were switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w at Week 24. The LS 
mean change from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg 
q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was -0.53 and -0.31, respectively, with an LS mean difference of -0.22 
(95% CI: -0.50 to 0.07).

Other secondary endpoint: Responder analysis 
Responder analyses evaluated the percentage of patients with a change from baseline in bilateral 
endoscopic NPS ≥1 point or ≥2 points at Week 24. A higher percentage of patients had a ≥1 point 
and ≥2 point improvement in NPS in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) 
compared with the placebo[(62.0% versus 10.5%, nominal p<0.0001) and (46.1% versus 0.7%, 
nominal p<0.0001) respectively]. The improvement in NPS was rapid and a difference was seen as 
early as assessment at Week 4. The improvement continued through week 24 and week 52, 
resulting in a higher percentage of responders at Week 52 for both dupilumab groups than that 
observed in week 24.

CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN NASAL CONGESTION/OBSTRUCTION (NC) 
Nasal congestion/obstruction was assessed by the patient on a daily basis using a 0 to 3 
categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms, and 3 = 
severe symptoms) as a reflective assessment using a 24-hour recall period. 
Primary analysis: Change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction at Week 24 
The dupilumab treatment group shows a statistically significant improvement in the mean NC 
symptom score compared with placebo at Week 24, with an LS mean change from baseline to 
Week 24 of -1.25 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and -0.38 for the 
placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -0.87 with 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.71; p<0.0001). 
Primary approach: Change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) at Week 24 - ITT population 
The improvement in NC score was rapid with an onset of a difference observed at Week 4 with an 
LS mean change from baseline to Week 4 of -0.52 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [pooled 
Arm A+B] and -0.16 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -0.37 with 95% 
CI: -0.46 to -0.27; nominal p<0.0001). The NC symptom score showed continued improvement 
through Week 24.

LS mean change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) by month up to Week 24 - ITT population 
Sensitivity analyses using the MMRM approach, Pattern mixture model (PMM) and as-observed 
analysis showed similar results as the primary WOCF/MI analysis. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline at Week 52 (Multiplicity controlled) 
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the mean NC 
symptom score compared with placebo at Week 52 (LS mean difference in the 300 mg q2w 
dupilumab group [Arm A] versus placebo: -0.98 with 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.79; p<0.0001).  
Change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) at Week 52 - ITT population 
The improvement in NC score was similar for patients who stayed on dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
compared with those who were switched to 300 mg q4w at Week 24. The LS mean change from 
Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group 
(Arm B) was -0.16 and -0.17, respectively, with an LS mean difference of 0.01 (95% CI: -0.12 to 
0.14).

Other secondary endpoint: Proportion of patients with improvement in nasal congestion/obstruction 
severity grade at Week 24 
For this analysis, the baseline NC score was the median of the daily score in the 7 days prior to 
randomization. 
Similar to the results observed for the primary analysis, dupilumab 300 mg q2w increased the 
proportion of patients with improvement from baseline in NC score at Week 24 compared with the 
placebo group. 
Other secondary endpoint: Nasal polyps score and nasal congestion/obstruction: Responder 
analysis 
For the purpose of this responder analysis evaluating the percentage of patients with improvement 
in both NPS and NC, improvement in NPS was considered a decrease from baseline ≥1 point and 
improvement in NC score was considered a decrease from baseline ≥0.5 points. 
At Week 24, a higher percentage of patients showed improvement in both NPS and NC in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) compared with placebo (52.2% versus 5.2%, 
nominal p<0.0001).  
At Week 52, the proportion of patients showing improvement in both NPS and NC score was 
greater in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) compared with the placebo group (58.7% 
versus 9.2%, nominal p<0.0001). Similar results were seen for the patients who were switched to 
dupilumab 300 mg q4w at Week 24. The proportion of patients showing improvement in both score

was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) compared with placebo at Week 52 
(57.9% versus 9.2%, nominal p<0.0001). 
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
•  Sinus opacification CT scan score (Lund-Mackay score) 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
A statistically significant improvement in the mean total sinus opacification CT scan score (LMK) is 
seen in the dupilumab treatment arm compared to placebo, which showed no improvement in sinus 
disease at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group [pooled Arm A+B] 
versus placebo: -5.13 with 95% CI: -5.80 to -4.46; p<0.0001). 
Primary approach: Change from baseline in sinus opacification CT scan score (Lund-Mackay score) at Week 24 - 
ITT population 
Sensitivity analyses show similar results as the primary WOCF/MI analysis. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints: Change from baseline to Week 52  
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in sinus opacification CT 
scan score (LMK) compared with placebo at Week 52 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group [Arm A] versus placebo at Week 52: -6.94 with 95% CI: -7.87 to -6.01; nominal 
p<0.0001). The LS mean change from baseline to Week 52 for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
was greater than that observed at Week 24, indicating continued improvement through 52 weeks. 
An improvement was also observed for patients who switched at Week 24 from 300 mg q2w to 300 
mg q4w (Arm B). However, a greater numerical improvement was seen in sinus opacification CT 
scan score (LMK) in patients who stayed on dupilumab 300 mg q2w compared with those who 
switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w from Week 24 to Week 52. The LS mean difference from Week 
24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) 
was -1.37 and -0.62, respectively, with an LS mean difference of -0.75 (95% CI: -1.52 to 0.01). 
•  Disease specific daily symptom assessment and total symptom score (TSS)

EMA/547569/2019 
Page 135/238 
 
  
  
 
 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
The improvement in mean TSS in the dupilumab group compared to placebo was statistical 
significant at week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group [pooled Arm A+B] 
versus placebo: -2.44 with 95% CI: -2.87 to -2.02; p<0.0001).  
 Change from baseline in total symptom score (TSS) at Week 24 - ITT population 
Consistent with the observations in the individual symptoms (for NC, loss of smell, and rhinorrhea), 
the improvement in TSS score was rapid with an onset of a difference versus placebo observed as 
early as the first post-baseline monthly average score at Week 4 and improved through week 24. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints: Change from baseline to Week 52 
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated a substantial improvement in the mean TSS compared with 
placebo at Week 52 (LS mean difference in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [Arm A] versus 
placebo at Week 52: -2.85 with 95% CI: -3.35 to -2.35; nominal p<0.0001). The LS mean change 
was greater than in week 24, indicating continued improvement. An improvement was seen for 
patients on dupilumab 300 mg q2w and those who switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w from Week 
24 to Week 52. The LS mean difference from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w arm (Arm B) was -0.50 and -0.57, respectively with an LS 
mean difference of 0.07 (95% CI: -0.26 to 0.41).

•  Smell test: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
Dupilumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean UPSIT compared with 
placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group [pooled Arm A+B] 
versus placebo: 10.52, with 95% CI: 8.98 to 12.07 (p<0.0001). 
Change from baseline in UPSIT at Week 24 - ITT population 
The improvement was rapid, with an LS mean change from baseline to Week 2 of 6.40 for the 300 
mg q2w dupilumab group [pooled Arm A+B] and 0.93 for the placebo group (LS mean difference 
versus placebo: 5.47 with 95% CI: 3.97 to 6.98; nominal p<0.0001) and showed continued 
improvement through approximately Week 16 at which time a plateau through Week 24 was 
observed. Of note, In study EFC14280, the proportion of patients with anosmia at Week 24 was 
reduced from 79.4% to 30% in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) compared 
with almost no change in the placebo group (76.7 % at baseline and 76.6% at Week 24).

At week 52 dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated an improvement in mean UPSIT compared to 
placebo (LS mean difference in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [Arm A] versus placebo at Week 
52: 10.30 with 95% CI: 8.50 to 12.10 (nominal p<0.0001). The LS mean change was similar to 
the observed change at week 24. The maximum increase in UPSIT was obtained at Week 16 and 
plateaued through Week 52. Similar UPSIT scores were seen in patients on dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
compared to the patients who were switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w from Week 24 to Week 52. 
The LS mean change from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 
300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was -0.54 and +0.31, respectively, with an LS mean difference of 
-0.85 (95% CI: -2.06 to 0.37). 
LS mean change from baseline in UPSIT score by visit up to Week 52 - ITT population 
Other secondary efficacy endpoint: Patients with anosmia by UPSIT scores 
At Week 24, the proportion of patients with anosmia was reduced from 79.4% to 30.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) with essentially no change in the placebo group 
(76.7% to 76.6%). 28.9% of patients in the dupilumab group had  UPSIT scores in either the mild 
microsmia or normal smell perception range at week 24. In contrast, in the placebo group, 9 
patients had mild microsmia or normal smell at baseline and only 5 (3.4%) had UPSIT scores in the 
mild microsmia or normal smell perception range at the same timepoint. Similar were the results at 
week 52, where the proportion of patients with anosmia was lower in both the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w groups compared with the placebo group (28.1% and 27.5% for the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w groups, respectively, versus 75.4% for the placebo 
group). 
• 
Decreased/loss of sense of smell 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline to Week 24 (Multiplicity controlled) 
Dupilumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean daily assessed loss of 
smell score compared with placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group [pooled Arm A+B] versus placebo: -0.98 with 95% CI: -1.15 to -0.81; p<0.0001).

The improvement was rapid with an onset of a difference versus placebo observed as early as the 
first post-baseline monthly average score at Week 4 with an LS mean change from baseline to 
Week 4 of -0.38 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [pooled Arm A+B] and -0.07 for the placebo 
group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -0.31 with 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.22; nominal p<0.0001). 
The sense of smell score showed continued improvement through Week 24. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints: Change from baseline to Week 52 
Similar to the key secondary endpoint at week 24 improvement in the mean daily self-reported loss 
of smell score in the dupilumab groups was demonstrated compared with placebo at Week 52 (LS 
mean difference in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [Arm A] versus placebo at Week 52: -1.10 
with 95% CI: -1.31 to -0.89; nominal p<0.0001). The maximum effect was obtained at 
approximately Week 36 and sustained through Week 52. A similar improvement in loss of smell 
was observed in both dupilumab groups (dupilumab 300 mg q2w and dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w/q4w). The LS mean change from Week 24 to Week 52 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
(Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was -0.14 and -0.20, respectively with an LS mean 
difference of 0.06 (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.20).

Dupilumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean SNOT-22 total score 
compared with placebo at Week 24 (LS mean difference in the dupilumab group [pooled Arm A+B] 
versus placebo: -17.36 with 95% CI: -20.87 to -13.85; p<0.0001).  
Change from baseline in SNOT-22 at Week 24 - ITT population 
The improvement in SNOT-22 total score was rapid and observed as early as Week 4 with an LS 
mean change from baseline to Week 4 of -19.77 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [pooled Arm 
A+B] and -8.35 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -11.41 with 95% CI: -
14.78 to -8.05; nominal p<0.0001). The SNOT-22 total score showed continued improvement 
through Week 24. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoint: Change from baseline to Week 52 
In line with the key secondary endpoint Dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in mean SNOT-22 compared with placebo at Week 52 (LS mean difference 
in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group [Arm A] versus placebo: -20.96 with 95% CI: -25.03 to -
16.89; p<0.0001). The LS mean change at Week 52 for the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group was 
greater than that observed at Week 24, indicating continued improvement through 52. Similar 
improvement was observed in patients who stayed on dupilumab 300 mg q2w compared with those 
who were switched to dupilumab 300 mg q4w at Week 24. The LS mean change from Week 24 to 
Week 52 in the 300 mg q2w group (Arm A) and 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) was -2.84 and -
2.45, respectively, with an LS mean difference of -0.39 (95% CI: -2.90 to 2.12).

Other secondary efficacy endpoint: Responder analysis 
At Week 24, a higher percentage of patients had a ≥8.9 point decrease in SNOT-22 total score in 
the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) compared with the placebo group (73.9% 
versus 39.9%, nominal p<0.0001).  
At Week 52, the proportion of patients meeting the MCID was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group (Arm A) compared with the placebo group (75.3% versus 30.1%, nominal p<0.0001). 
Likewise, for the patients who were switched to 300 mg q4w at Week 24, the proportion of patients 
showing MCID improvement was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group (Arm B) 
compared with the placebo group at Week 52 (76.6% versus 30.1%, nominal p<0.0001). 
•  Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment 
The proportion of patients who required rescue treatment with SCS or NP surgery during the 
treatment period was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg group (pooled Arm A for 52 weeks + Arm B 
for first 24 weeks; q2w dosing) compared with the placebo group during the 52 week treatment 
period (Kaplan-Meier estimate at Week 52: 13.1% versus 44.4%, with a hazard ratio [95% CI] of 
0.238 [0.156 to 0.364], nominal p<0.0001) (Table 48 ).  
The difference between the dupilumab group and placebo group was apparent from Week 4 
through the end of the study period (Figure 26 ).

•  Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment – Pooled Study EFC14146 and 
EFC14280 (controlled for multiplicity) 
Since the assumption for the number of patients requiring SCS or NP surgery rescue treatment for 
the sample size calculation was much lower than the observed number, the primary multiplicity 
controlled analysis of the proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment was planned in the 
pooled analysis of the 2 pivotal CRSwNP studies, the current study and EFC14146.  
In the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted pooled analysis of two studies, treatment with dupilumab 
resulted in significant reduction of systemic corticosteroid use and need for sino-nasal surgery 
versus placebo (HR of 0.24; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.35) (see Figure8). The proportion of patients who 
required systemic corticosteroids was reduced by 74% (HR of 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.38). The total 
number of systemic corticosteroid courses per year was reduced by 75% (RR of 0.25; 95% CI: 
0.17, 0.37). The mean individual annualised prescribed total dose of systemic corticosteroids (in 
mg) during the treatment period was 71% lower in the pooled dupilumab group compared with the 
pooled placebo group (60.5 [531.3] mg versus 209.5 [497.2] mg, respectively). The proportion of 
patients who required surgery was reduced by 83% (HR of 0.17; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.46).

Primary analysis: change from baseline in SNOT-22 at Week 24 - pooled ITT population 
The applicant presented pooled analysis (study EFC14146 and EFC14280) of patients who required 
rescue  treatment  with  SCS  or  with  sino-nasal  surgery.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  required 
treatment with SCS or sino-nasal surgery during the treatment period was significantly lower in the 
pooled  dupilumab  300  mg  q2w  group  (12.5%)  compared  with  the  pooled  placebo  group  (41.8%) 
across the 52-week treatment period (both are Kaplan-Meier estimates with a Hazard ratio [95% CI] 
of 0.243 [0.169-0.351], p <0.0001).  
Also less patients required rescue sino-nasal surgery or SCS when these treatments were analysed 
separately.

There are no definitive or established biomarkers that can discern type 2 inflammation versus non-
type 2 inflammation mediated CRSwNP. Due to the lack of the established biomarkers that predict 
response the Applicant has performed several subgroup analyses for NPS, LMK, and NC by 
eosinophil baseline level and other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers as requested by the Agency 
which confirmed that dupilumab was efficacious in patients across the baseline blood eosinophil 
subgroups (<0.15 versus ≥0.15 Giga/L) and baseline serum total IgE, periostin, and TARC 
subgroups (above or below median levels) (see below):

20% of patients were not receiving INCS at screening (Visit 1), all patients in the study underwent 
4 weeks run-in period before randomization (V2) during which they received mometasone furoate 
nasal spray (MFNS, two actuations [50 μg/actuation] in each nostril BID). Thus all patients 
received at least 4 weeks of INCS at baseline prior to randomization. The change in baseline scores 
for NPS and nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) during the run-in (between Visit 1 and Visit 2) were 
minimal and similar between patients who were on INCS before screening and those who were 
INCS-naive at screening ie, 28 days before baseline and indicate that lack of INCS before screening 
(Visit A) doesn’t affect disease severity at baseline (Visit 2). These data indicate a study population 
severe and uncontrolled by standard of care including INCS, SCS, and/or surgery.

c) Supportive study 
Study ACT12340 
Title :  
 ACT12340: a Phase 2 proof of concept study evaluating the effect of dupilumab 300 mg 
administered subcutaneously (SC) once every week for 16 weeks, with a loading dose of 600 mg 
on Day 1, in patients with CRSwNP and chronic symptoms of sinusitis on a background therapy of 
mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS). 
This study was a Phase 2 multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study evaluating the effect of 300 mg of dupilumab administered every week (QW) 
subcutaneous (SC) for 16 weeks with a loading dose of 600 milligrams (mg) on Day (D)1. 
Methods 
Study design 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 163/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The clinical study consisted of three periods: 
1.  Screening run-in on mometasone fuorate nasal spray (MFNS) for 4 weeks 
2.  Randomized Dupilumab/Placebo Treatment Period (16 weeks) 
3.  Post-treatment Period for PK, immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy (16 weeks) 
Patients were randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupilumab 300 mg qw and placebo. 
Study participants 
The population of ACT12340 was composed of patients >18 years of age with a physician 
endoscopic diagnosis of bilateral NP with a minimum bilateral NPS of 5 out of a maximum score of 
8 for both nostrils despite completion of a prior topical intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) treatment 
for at least 8 weeks before screening and chronic symptoms of sinusitis. Excluded were patients 
who had undergone any nasal surgery (including polypectomy) within 6 months before screening 
or had more than 5 sino-nasal surgeries in the past, who required a burst of systemic 
corticosteroids within the 2 months before screening, were treated with monoclonal antibodies 
(mAB) or immunosuppressive treatment within 2 month before screening. 
Treatments 
The study treatments used were dupilumab or placebo. Sterile dupilumab and matching placebo 
was presented in 5 milliliter (mL) glass vials. Each vial contained a deliverable volume of 2 mL. The 
route and method of administration was SC by the Investigator or delegate. 
At the first day of dosing, the patient received 2 injections as a loading dose of 600 mg. Thereafter, 
300 mg QW was given as a single injection.  
This study explored the 300 mg qw dose regimen. This dose was anticipated to saturate apparent 
target mediated clearance level (10-15 mg/L) and had been tested in two previous proof-of-
concept studies performed with dupilumab in asthma and atopic dermatitis. The first dose 
employed a loading dose of 600 mg in order to achieve faster steady-state concentration. This 
loading dose range was supported by the acceptable safety profile of the highest loading dose (600 
mg) demonstrated in the TDU12265 study. 
Mometasone fuorate nasal spray was permitted as concomitant medication.  
Objectives/Endpoints 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of bilateral NP by 
assessment of the endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) in comparison to placebo. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate dupilumab in patients with bilateral nasal polyps, with 
regards to: 
•  Symptoms of sinusitis 
•  Computed Tomography (CT) scan changes 
•  Nasal Polyp Score in the sub-group of patients with comorbid asthma 
•  Safety and tolerability 
• 
•  Concentrations of dupilumab in serum 
•

• 
Effect of dupilumab in patient reported outcomes (PROs) and quality of life (QoL) scales 
The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline at Week 16 in bilateral endoscopic 
NPS. 
Secondary endpoints were change from baseline at Week 16 in: 
•  Patient reported symptoms 
•  22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) 
•  Subject-assessed nasal congestion/obstruction, anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose), 
posterior rhinorrhea (post nasal drip), and loss of sense of smell, (daily ante meridiem 
[AM] and post meridiem [PM] e-diary) month average 
•  Number of nocturnal awakenings 
•  Patient-rated rhinosinusitis symptoms severity using visual analog scale (VAS) 
•  Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) 
•  Smell test (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]) 
•  The proportion of subjects demonstrating an improvement in NPS (defined as a reduction 
in bilateral polyp grade score of at least 1.0 from baseline at Week 16) 
•  Computed tomography scan assessments 
•  Time to first response (≥1 point improvement) in NPS. 
The sample size estimation was based on the comparison between dupilumab 300 mg versus 
placebo with regard to the primary endpoint: change from baseline in NPS at Week 16. 
Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.5, a 2-sided t-test and significance level of 0.05, 
20% discontinuation rate, 28 patients per group will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 
1.3 between dupilumab and placebo groups in the change of NPS from baseline to Week 16. 
Randomization 
Patients who meet the entry criteria were randomized via interactive voice response system (IVRS) 
using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupilumab 300 mg QW or placebo QW for 16 weeks. The 
randomization was stratified based on asthma comorbidity status at visit 1 and nasal biopsy 
sampling (Yes or No) at visit 2. The study was double-blind to avoid the bias incurred by an 
unblinded design. The study was placebo-controlled to minimize bias and to present a control 
group to which differential efficacy and safety could be compared. 
Participant flow 
60 patients were randomized to receive either dupilumab 300 mg or matching placebo. In addition 
to the study treatment, all patients received an INCS. Of those 60 patients randomized, 53 
completed the study period and 7 patients who were treated discontinued the study period 
prematurely. Study period discontinuation rates were higher in the placebo group compared to the 
dupilumab group with primary reasons being patient request (n=5 patients in the placebo group 
and 1 patient in the dupilumab group) and adverse event (n=4 patients in the placebo group).

(n=46; 76.7%) patients was <30 kg/m2 with a mean BMI of 27.46 kg/m2 (range, 20.9 to 38 
kg/m2). Over 73% of participants were from Europe, while the remainder was from the US. 43 
(71.7%) out of 60 patients had at least 1 atopic medical history in the study with 40 patient’s 
condition continuing post baseline. The most frequently reported history was allergic rhinitis 
(56.7%) reported by an equal number of patients in both treatment groups, followed by allergic 
conjunctivitis and hypersensitivity to NSAID (28.3% each). 
All randomized patients reporting any rhinitis or sinusitis medical history within the past year prior 
to screening had their baseline conditions ongoing. 
 At baseline, the mean bilateral NPS was 5.77 out of a maximum of 8. The mean SNOT-22 score 
was 41 with a score range of 8 to 91 (maximum possible score of 110) and the UPSIT smell mean 
test result was 14.20. Upon CT-scan evaluation, most patients had complete opacification of the 
sinuses as assessed by the Lund-Mackay total mean score of 18.68.  
Overall, mainly patients with moderate to severe NP disease were randomized in this study. 
Most randomized patients (n=57; 95%) were taking INCS medications 2 months before screening. 
Three patients were not on a stable administration of MNFS prior to screening. Those medications 
included mometasone furoate (61.7%), fluticasone propionate (18.3%), and fluticasone furoate 
(11.7%) and were reported more frequently in the dupilumab group while beclometasone 
dipropionate and flucticasone (5% each) were reported more in the placebo group. Budesonide and 
triamcinolone acetonide were recorded for a single patient in each treatment group. 
Sixty patients (30 patients in the placebo group and 30 patients in the dupilumab group) were 
randomized and included in the ITT group, which was the primary population for the efficacy 
parameters in this study.  Of the 60 patients included in the safety population, all had at least 1 
post treatment ADA sample and were available for the ADA population while those patients in the 
dupilumab group only (n=30) had at least 1 evaluable plasma concentration data and were 
considered in the PK population.

Mean change from baseline in bilateral endoscopic nasal polyps score by visit- ITT population 
The results demonstrate improvement in the bilateral endoscopic NPS compared with placebo at 
Week 16 (p=0.0009). The LS mean change (SE) from baseline to Week 16 using MMRM analysis 
was -0.30 (0.34) for the placebo group and -1.85 (0.30) for the dupilumab group.  
Subgroup analyses were performed on the mean change from baseline at Week 16 in bilateral NPS.

Mean decreases in NPS at Week 16 in the comorbid asthma group was consistent with results seen 
in the overall population where dupilumab demonstrated a statistically significant mean 
improvement (LS mean difference of -2.30 [95% CI: -3.41, -1.18] p=0.0002). Baseline weight 
<90 kg and ≥ 90 kg did not affect the treatment benefit of dupilumab. 
Secondary endpoints 
The change from baseline at Week 16 in SNOT-22  
An improvement in favour of dupilumab was seen. The LS mean change (SE) from baseline at 
Week 16 was -9.17 (2.96) in the placebo group and -27.28 (2.71) in the dupilumab group, 
resulting in a LS mean difference of -18.11 (95% CI: -25.62, -10.60, p<0.0001).

anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose), posterior rhinorrhea (post nasal drip), and loss of 
sense of smell, (daily AM and PM e-diary) month average 
Nasal congestion/obstruction 
The dupilumab group showed greater improvement at Week 16 in PM and AM symptom score 
compared to placebo. Statistical significance in favor of dupilumab was observed in the difference 
between groups in the change from baseline at Week 16 in subject assessed PM symptom score for 
nasal congestion/obstruction (LS mean difference of -0.71 [95% CI: -1.05, -0.37]; p=0.0001). The

mean change from baseline at Week 16 in AM symptoms for congestion/obstruction was in favour 
of dupilumab with a LS mean difference of -0.69 (95% CI: -1.05, -0.33); p=0.0003. 
At the end of the 16 week follow up period, improvement compared to baseline was sustained in 
both treatment groups for PM and AM symptoms. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
The MAH submitted a variation application for the following indications: 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) 
Dupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of 
adults with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not 
provide adequate disease control. 
No formal dose response study was performed in patients with nasal polyps. The dose regimens 
were selected based on the totality of clinical evidence in the dupilumab program including data 
from Phase 2 efficacy and safety study (ACT12340) in patients with nasal polyps and symptoms of 
chronic sinusitis, the result of Phase 2b dose ranging study in patients with moderate to severe 
asthma (DRI12544), the Phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) and phase 3 studies (R668-
AD-1334 and R668-AD-1416) in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), as well 
as the supportive PK/pharmacodynamic [PD] analysis. 
It is noted that the proposed dosing regimen and doses tested in pivotal studies deviates from the 
one that was tested in the proof of concept study ACT12340 (i.e. q2w instead of weekly dosing; no 
loading dose). The simulated concentration-time profiles for dupilumab in typical NP patients 
receiving 300 mg q2w with or without a loading dose of 600 mg (-please see discussion in the PK 
section) confirmed that the absence of loading dose results in longer time to steady state, but does 
not impact the steady state level. While it is acknowledged that the PK steady state would take 
slightly longer without a loading dose, the time-course as well as extent of response over the 24 to 
52-week period in the phase 3 studies is similar with or without a loading dose, this supports the 
Applicant’s choice to not include a loading dose for the CRSwNP program.  
The applicant provided a justification for q2w regimen. The SNOT-22 results from 300mg q2w 
being used in asthma patients with NP as co-morbidity were discussed and used as a justification 
for the selected dose. In asthma dose ranging study (DRI12544), 300 mg q2w regimen 
demonstrated a robust treatment effect across all relevant indices of drug action, while lower dose 
or less frequent regimens 200 mg q2w and 300mg q4w showed less effect in some endpoints 
including SNOT-22. 
In both studies, dupilumab significantly improved the sense of smell with improvement noted as 
early as Week 2. Nearly two-thirds of the dupilumab-treated patients who were anosmic at baseline 
(UPSIT score ≤18) improved their UPSIT score to the non-anosmic range of >19 at Week 24. In 
the placebo group almost all anosmic patients at baseline remained anosmic. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant performed two pivotal studies in support this variation application. 
Study EFC14146 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase III 
study. The study consisted of 3 periods a run-in period of 4 weeks, a treatment period of 24 weeks 
and a post treatment period of 24 weeks.  
In total 276 patients with CRSwNP were randomized 1:1 to Dupilumab 300 mg q2w or Placebo. The 
patient population consisted of patients 18 years and older with high CRSwNP disease burden 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

(based on polyps score) and symptoms of NC and loss of smell or rhinorrhea for at least 12 weeks 
prior to randomization (8 weeks prior to screening) despite therapy with intranasal corticosteroids, 
systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years or sino-nasal surgery. The demographic and baseline 
characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in the randomized population. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) history was comparable among the treatment 
groups as well as the disease baseline characteristics. 
Mometasone furoate (NASONEX) as background medication was to be administered by the patients 
in each nostril twice daily. 
Two co-primary endpoints, change from baseline to week 24 in NPS and change from baseline to 
week 24 in NC, were planned with the protocol.   
Furthermore, six key secondary endpoints were planned to be tested in hierarchical order in order 
to account for multiplicity: 1) change from baseline in LMK score at week 24, 2) change from 
baseline in TSS at week 24, 3) change from baseline in UPSIT at week 24, 4) change from baseline 
in loss of smell daily symptoms at week 24, 5) change from baseline in SNOT-22 at week 24,  
Study EFC14280 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm phase III 
study. The study consisted of a run-in period of 4 weeks, a randomized treatment period of 52 
weeks, where patients in Arm B were switched to dupilumab q4w dosing regimen at week 24 and a 
posttreatment period of 12 weeks. 
In total 448 subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to Dupilumab 300 mg q2w (arm A), Dupilumab 300 
mg q2w/q4w (arm B) or Placebo (arm C). The patient population consisted of patients 18 years 
and older with high CRSwNP disease burden (based on polyps score) and symptoms of NC and loss 
of smell or rhinorrhea for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization (8 weeks prior to screening) 
despite therapy with intranasal corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years or sino-
nasal surgery. The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between 
treatment groups in the randomized population. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
history was comparable among the treatment groups as well as the disease baseline 
characteristics.  
Mometasone furoate (NASONEX) as background medication was to be administered by the patients 
in each nostril twice daily. 
Two co-primary endpoints, change from baseline to week 24 in NPS and change from baseline to 
week 24 in NC, were planned with the protocol (pooled arms A+B vs. C).   
Furthermore, six key secondary endpoints were planned to be tested in hierarchical order in order 
to account for multiplicity: 1) change from baseline in LMK score at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. 
C), 2)change from baseline in TSS at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 3) change from baseline in 
UPSIT at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 4) change from baseline in loss of smell daily 
symptoms at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 5) change from baseline in SNOT-22 at week 24 
(pooled arms A+B vs. C), , 6)proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery for NP during the 
treatment period, 7) change from baseline in NPS at week 52 (A vs. C), 8) change from baseline in 
NC at week 52 (A vs. C), 9) change from baseline in NPS at week 52 (B vs. C), and 10) change 
from baseline in NC at week 52 (B vs. C). 
All enrolled patients required to receive prior treatment with SCS or be intolerant to SCS or 
underwent surgery for NP.  
Similar protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses were made in both studies. 
These changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on the study results.  In both studies a 
number of patients had a deviation considered critical or major (Study EFC14146: 29.4% of 
patients in the dupilumab group and 42.9% of patients in the placebo group, Study  EFC14280: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 171/238 
 
  
  
 
38.7% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 40.7% of patients in the 300 mg q2w-q4w 
group, and 49.7% of patients in the placebo group). 
There were 2 co-primary endpoints e.g nasal polyposis score (NPS) at week 24 and nasal 
congestion/obstruction score (NCS) at week 24. This approach is acceptable as change in nasal 
polyp size on its own is not considered sufficient as the primary endpoint as the interpretation of 
the clinical relevance of a reduction is difficult (as no MCID has been established) and therefore, 
adding an endpoint evaluating the impact of symptoms is of key importance in measuring 
outcomes in nasal polyposis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study EFC14146, the mean age of the randomized population was 50.49 (range from 22 to 85 
years), over half of the patients (158 [57.2%]) were males and the majority of patients were white 
(95.7%).161 randomized patients (58.3%) had a history of asthma whereas a total of 30.4% had a 
history of NSAID-ERD. 
In study EFC14280, the mean age of the randomized population was 51.95 years with a range of 
18 to 83 years. Approximately two-thirds (62.3%) of patients were males; and the majority 
(83.0%) of patients were White. 59.6% of randomized patients had a history of asthma and 26.8% 
had a history of NSAID-ERD. 
Overall, the literature suggests that CRSwNP increases with age, with a mean onset across all 
ethnic groups of 42 years. NP is uncommon under the age of 20 years and occurs more frequently 
in men than in women; aspirin-sensitive patients, however, are more likely to be women.  
The population which was recruited to both pivotal studies seems to reflect this literature finding. 
In both pivotal studies the majority of patients had increased baseline blood eosinophils level. In 
study EFC14146, at baseline, 87.3% of patients had blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and 59.1% of 
patients had blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L. In study EFC14280, at baseline 85 % of patients had 
blood eosinophils and ≥0.15 and 58.6% of patients had blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L. 
It is noted that about 20% of patients in both studies did not report receiving any intranasal 
corticosteroid medications in the year before screening.  
In general, it can be concluded that not all patients were receiving the maximum treatment with 
intranasal corticosteroid prior to enrolment and in fact some patients were not receiving any 
treatment. It can be agreed that the lack of INCS before screening did not affect significantly 
disease severity at baseline and the response to mometasone furoate during the run-in period was 
small in all patients. 
Most randomized patients (>80%) in both pivotal studies were taking intranasal corticosteroid 
medications in the year before screening. The most commonly used prior intranasal corticosteroid 
medications included mometasone furoate/mometasone (45.3% and 6.5% in study EFC14146 and 
33.5% and 33.5% in study EFC14280). In this study, other types of intranasal corticosteroid 
medications were used less frequently and doses varied. 
Overall 97.4% of randomized patients had a history of prior sino-nasal surgery and/or SCS use 
during the past 2 years, indicating inadequate control after maximal medical/surgical treatment.  
In study EFC14146, a total of 71.7% patients had previous surgery for NP and in the 2 years prior 
to randomization, 64.9% of patients received SCS at least once. In a second pivotal study, less 
patients underwent previous NP surgery (58.3%) whereas more patients had received treatments 
with SCS within 2 years prior to randomisation (80.1%).

The Applicant described  the enrolled patient population as severe as they had failed second line 
therapy (e.g. surgery for NP or treatment with SCS), and presented with objective measures 
(mean NPS  of 5.97/8 - sinus opacification measured by CT-scan ad LMK consistent with extensive 
disease) considered severe. However, if only symptoms are considered, the enrolled patient 
population was within moderate to severe disease category at baseline. 
 It is well accepted that for CRSwNP, the severity of disease should be primarily based on 
assessment of symptoms rather than polyp size. The mean nasal congestion score of 2.4 out of 
maximum score of 3 (2=moderate, 3=severe); mean loss of smell at baseline of 2.74 out of a 
maximum score of 3; mean UPSIT score of 13.98 (range of 0 to 40 with a score ≤18 indicating 
anosmia) and a mean daily total symptom score (TSS- a composite symptom score of nasal 
congestion/obstruction, rhinorrhea and sense of smell) of 7.16 out of maximum score of 9 were all 
indicative of a disease status in the severe spectrum. 
The 22-Item Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT22) was >50, means values 49.40 (in study 
EFC14146) and 51.86 (in EFC14280) (moderate >20-50 and severe as >50, Toma S1, Hopkins 
C2.). In addition, the mean VAS of the trial population was 7.88 above the treshold of 7 referred to 
in the European Position paper on Rhinisinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS 2012). Based on the 
totality of the baseline mean scores and severity distribution across signs and symptoms of 
disease, the Applicant considers that the vast majority of the phase 3 population is consistent with 
a severe and uncontrolled setting of CRSwNP. 
Study EFC14146 
Of the 276 patients randomized, 263 patients completed 24 weeks of study treatment. The 
demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between dupilumab and placebo 
groups.  
Statistical significance was reached for the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline 
in NPS and change from baseline in NC at Week 24) and all multiplicity adjusted key secondary 
endpoints including sinus opacification as measured by CT scan LMK score. 
The dupilumab 300 mg q2w regimen demonstrated clinically meaningful mean improvement in the 
bilateral endoscopic NPS and NC compared with placebo at Week 24 (co-primary endpoints). The 
LS mean change in NPS from baseline to Week 24 was -1.89 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group 
and 0.17 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo 
was -2.06 with 95% CI: -2.43 to -1.69 (p <0.0001). The improvement in NPS was observed early 
at week 8 (first post-baseline assessment) and showed continuous improvement through week 24. 
The LS mean change in NC score from baseline to Week 24 was -1.34 for the dupilumab group and 
-0.45 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -
0.89 with 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.71 (p <0.0001). The onset of difference was observed as early as 
the first post-baseline monthly average score at Week 4. Similar to NPS, the NC showed continued 
improvement through Week 24. The sensitivity analyses conducted showed similar results and 
supported the robustness of the results. The subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints 
demonstrated consistent results across the demographic and baseline characteristics. 
Results from the key secondary endpoints were consistent with the results from the primary 
endpoints. The LS mean change in sinus opacification as measured by CT scan LMK from baseline 
to Week 24 was -8.18 for the dupilumab group and -0.74 for the placebo group. The LS mean 
difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -7.44 with 95% CI: -8.35 to -6.53 (p 
<0.0001). The LS mean change in total symptom score from baseline to Week 24 was -3.77 for the 
dupilumab group and -1.17 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group 
versus placebo was -2.61 with 95% CI: -3.04 to -2.17 (p <0.0001). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Other key secondary efficacy endpoints, included loss of sense of smell (individual daily loss of 
smell severity item of symptoms e-diary score and UPSIT score), the most troublesome symptom 
complaint by CRSwNP patients and generally refractory to currently available therapy, and disease 
specific HRQoL (SNOT-22 total score) at Week 24. Similar to the primary and key secondary 
endpoints dupilumab demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in these endpoints. LS 
mean difference in UPSIT score in the dupilumab group versus placebo was 10.56 with 95% CI: 
8.79 to 12.34 (p <0.0001). The LS mean difference in loss of smell score in the dupilumab group 
versus placebo was -1.12 with 95% CI: -1.31 to -0.93 (p <0.0001). The LS mean difference in 
SNOT-22 total score in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -21.12 with 95% CI: -25.17 to -
17.06 (p <0.0001). 
At week 24 dupilumab treatment was discontinued. In the following 24-week follow-up period the 
treatment effect diminished without rebound across all endpoints. At Week 48, the LS mean 
difference in NPS score in the dupilumab group versus placebo was reduced to -0.80 with 95% CI: 
-1.11 to -0.48 and the LS mean difference in NC in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -0.26 
with 95% CI: -0.46 to -0.06. 
Fifty-eight point three percent (58.3%) of the CRSwNP patients had asthma and 30.4% had a 
history of NSAID-ERD. In CRSwNP patients with asthma, dupilumab 300 mg q2w demonstrated 
clinically meaningful improvements in mean NPS, NC, sinus opacification as measured by CT scan 
LMK score, SNOT-22 total score, FEV1 and ACQ-6 compared with placebo at Week 24. 
Study EFC14280 
Of the 448 patients randomized, 418 patients completed the first 24 weeks of study treatment. 
Twenty nine (29) patients discontinued from the study treatment prior to Week 24 (12.4% in 
placebo versus 3.4% in the dupilumab group) and 1 patient did not receive any study treatment. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in 
the randomized population.  
Statistical significance was reached for the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints and all multiplicity 
adjusted key secondary endpoints. 
At week 24 Dupilumab at 300 mg q2w demonstrated a statistically and clinically meaningful 
improvement in the bilateral endoscopic NPS and NC symptom score compared with placebo. The 
LS mean change in NPS from baseline to Week 24 was -1.71 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group 
(pooled Arm A+B) and was +0.10 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab 
group versus placebo was -1.80 with 95% CI: -2.10 to -1.51 (p <0.0001). The LS mean change in 
NC score from baseline to Week 24 was -1.25 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm 
A+B) and was -0.38 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus 
placebo was -0.87 with 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.71 (p <0.0001). A rapid onset of efficacy was seen 
and differences between the dupilumab groups and placebo were seen as early as week 4 post-
baseline. The improvements continued through week 24.  The results of the sensitivity analyses 
performed (including as-observed analysis taking into account all data in patients who receive SCS 
for any reason or missing data) were similar and support the results from the primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses show consisted results across demographic and baseline characteristics. The 
onset of effect for dupilumab was rapid, with a meaningful difference between the dupilumab 
groups and placebo group observed as early as the first assessment for each endpoint (Week 2 to 
Week 4) after initiation of treatment. 
Results from the key secondary endpoints were consistent with the results from the primary 
endpoints. The LS mean change in sinus opacification as measured by CT scan LMK score from 
baseline to Week 24 was -5.21 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and was -
0.09 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -

5.13 with 95% CI: -5.80 to -4.46 (p <0.0001). The LS mean change in total symptom score from 
baseline to Week 24 was -3.45 for the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and was -
1.00 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -
2.44 with 95% CI: -2.87 to -2.02 (p <0.0001). The LS mean difference in UPSIT score in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) versus placebo was 10.52 with 95% CI: 8.98 to 
12.07 (p <0.0001). The LS mean difference in loss of smell score in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group (pooled Arm A+B) versus placebo was -0.98 with 95% CI: -1.15 to -0.81 (p <0.0001). The 
LS mean difference in SNOT-22 total score in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (pooled Arm A+B) 
versus placebo was -17.36 with 95% CI: -20.87 to -13.85 (p <0.0001). 
Through week 52 patients in both dupilumab Arm A (continued on 300 mg q2w) and Arm B 
(switched to 300 mg q4w at Week 24) showed continued improvement without reaching a plateau 
for nearly all endpoints, with the exception of UPSIT for which a plateau in the treatment effect was 
observed between Weeks 24 and 52. The LS mean difference in NPS in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab 
group (Arm A) versus placebo at Week 52 was -2.40 with 95% CI: -2.77 to -2.02 (p <0.0001). 
Similarly, the LS mean difference in the 300 mg q2w-q4w dupilumab group (Arm B) versus placebo 
at Week 52 was -2.21 with 95% CI: -2.59 to -1.83 (nominal p <0.0001). With regards to most 
clinical endpoints, the results of the two dosing regimens were similar. The observed improvement 
between Weeks 24 and 52 in NPS and LMK was numerically greater in the patients who continued 
on the q2w regimen compared with those who switched to q4w dosing.  
The dupilumab drug concentration data showed that more patients in the 300 mg q2wq4w regimen 
(8.7%) had steady-state concentrations that were below the limit of quantitation (0.078 mg/L) 
than those in the 300 mg q2w regimen (1.8%) at Week 52. A lower proportion of patients at the 
300 mg q2w-q4w regimen (86%) maintained steady-state trough concentrations above the EC50 
(1.75 mg/L) of NPS response compared to 300 mg q2w (97%). The proportion of patients who 
maintained Week 52 steady-state trough concentrations above the EC90 (15.8 mg/L) of NPS 
response was 98%, and 41% at 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w-q4w regimens, respectively. 
In addition, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of sinusitis, nasal polyps, and asthma 
which are generally associated with worsening of CRSwNP or asthma, were numerically higher in 
patients who switched at Week 24 from dupilumab 300 mg q2w to q4w dosing compared with 
those who remained on q2w. This suggests that the q4w arm may have suboptimal disease control 
in a subset of patients and the imbalance noted in TEAEs was indicative of gradual loss of clinical 
symptom control for both CRSwNP and comorbid asthma. 
The number of patients who underwent surgery for NP and also received treatment with SCS was 
106 patients (38.4%) in EFC14146, and 186 patients (41.5%) in EFC14280. The number of 
patients who underwent surgery for NP but were not treated with SCS was 92 (33.3%) in 
EFC14146 and 75 patients (16.7%) in EFC14280. The efficacy in these subgroups was consistent 
with the overall efficacy in the ITT. The number of patients who received treatment with SCS only 
was 73 (26.4%) in EFC14146 and 173 (38.6%) in EFC14280. Only 5 patients (3 placebo and 2 
dupilumab) in EFC14146 and 14 patients (5 placebo and 9 dupilumab) in EFC14280 had not 
undergone prior surgery or previously received treatment with SCS. Although the small numbers 
by subgroup does not allow any statistical comparison between treatment groups, reduction in NPS 
and NC in this subgroup was consistent with the overall efficacy in the ITT. 
In the phase 3 studies in CRSwNP there was a limited number of patients ≥110 kg. Of the 276 
patients randomized in study EFC14146, 19 (11 placebo and 8 dupilumab patients) were ≥110 kg. 
In EFC14280, 23 out of 448 patients (7 placebo and 16 dupilumab patients) were ≥110 kg. Only 4 
patients (3 placebo and 1 dupilumab) in EFC14146 study and 7 patients (2 placebo and 5 
dupilumab) in EFC14280 study were ≥130 kg. Despite the limited sample size the magnitude of the 
effect in this subgroup was consistent with the overall observations in the ITT.In relation to nasal

polyposis score (NPS) at week 24, in both pivotal studies statistically significant improvement was 
observed in the dupilumab groups (in arm A in study EFC14146 and pooled arm A + B in study 
EFC14280) with slightly better results reported in study EFC14146. 
In study EFC14146, an LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 was -1.89 for the 300 mg q2w 
dupilumab group and +0.17 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -2.06 with 
95% CI: -2.43 to -1.69 (p<0.0001). 
The applicant provided Responder Analysis at Week 24 e.g the percentage of patients with a 
change from baseline in bilateral endoscopic NPS ≥1 point or ≥2 points at Week 24. 
In relation to change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction score (NCS)  at Week 24, again 
for both pivotal studies statistically significant improvement was observed in the dupilumab groups 
(in arm A in study EFC14146 and  in pooled arm A + B in study EFC14280).  
In study EFC14146, an LS mean change from baseline to Week 24 was -1.34 for the dupilumab 
group and -0.45 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -0.89 with 95% CI: -
1.07 to -0.71; p<0.0001). 
The results of secondary endpoints were consistent with the results the primary endpoints 
showing  significant treatment effects in patients receiving Dupilumab as compared to patients 
receiving placebo. 
Supportive study ACT12340 
ACT12340 was a proof of concept study in which the effect of 300 mg of dupilumab administered qw 
SC (with 600 mg loading dose) for 16 weeks was compared to placebo.  
The study population included patients with nasal polyps with a minimum bilateral NPS of 5 out of a 
maximum score of 8 for both nostrils (with at least a score of 2 for each nostril) despite completion 
of a prior INCS treatment for at least 8 weeks before screening. In addition, enrolled patients had to 
report at least two of symptoms such as nasal blockade/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge 
(anterior/posterior nasal drip); facial pain/pressure; reduction or loss of smell. 
In contrast to the pivotal studies, in study ACT12340 there was no requirement for minimal nasal 
congestion score at baseline or having history of prior treatment with SCS or surgery for NP. 
Sixty (60) patients were randomized and 23 completed this study in the placebo arm and 28 in the 
treatment arm.  
Despite  these  differences  in  the  in  the  inclusion  criteria,  the  enrolled  study  population  was  only 
slightly less severe as compared to patients enrolled to the pivotal studies (the mean bilateral NPS 
was 5.77, the mean SNOT-22 score was 41, Lund-Mackay total mean score of 18.68).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Week 16 in bilateral endoscopic NPS 
which is acceptable in the context of a proof of concept study.  At Week 16 a significant improvement 
in bilateral endoscopic NPS was reported in the Dupilumab arm as compared to the placebo arm (LS 
mean  difference  was  -1.55).  The  reported  treatment  effect  was  similar  to  the  effect  reported  in 
pivotal studies for this endpoint (In study EFC14146, LS mean difference versus placebo was -2.06, 
in study EFC14280,  LS mean difference versus placebo was -1.80) 
The results of secondary endpoints supported the primary efficacy endpoint results. 
The proposed indication was as follows: 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) 
Dupixent is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with severe chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) who previously failed or are intolerant or 
contraindicated to systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery. 
Dupixent is indicated to reduce the need for surgery and systemic corticosteroid use in adult 
patients with inadequately controlled severe CRSwNP.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 176/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The second part of the indication was considered not acceptable by the CHMP as he data provided 
do not  support  an indication in reducing the need for surgery  and systemic corticosteroid use . 
Reduction of need for surgery and use of CS  are not considered as an indication as such. Indeed, 
As per the SmPC guideline, section 4.1 of the SmPC should define: 
- the target disease or condition, distinguishing between treatment, prevention and diagnostic 
indication; 
- when appropriate, the target population(s), especially when restrictions to the patient 
population(s) apply (including age groups and, when relevant, particular genotype); 
- any mandatory conditions of product usage not covered more appropriately in other parts of 
the SmPC, when relevant. 
Furthermore, study endpoints should not be presented in indications.  This part of the indication 
was therefore dropped by the applicant…] 
However it was considered by CHMP that some information would be important to provide to 
prescribers. Therefore results related to reduction of surgery and reduction of systemic 
corticosteroid use are included in section 5.1. 
The CHMP also considered that the word “maintenance” should be removed from the indication. 
Information about long term use is included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Additionally the CHMP considered that the population defined in the proposed indication was too 
broad and that the patient population for which dupixent should be used should be  patients for 
whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease 
control.  
In conclusion, the agreed indication is:   
Dupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intrasanal corticosteroids for the treatment in 
adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in patients for whom 
therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control.  
Paediatric patients 
The applicant proposed to add the following information to the SmPC: The safety and efficacy of 
dupilumab in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 12 years have not been established 
(see section 5.2). No data are available. CRSwNP does not normally occur in children. The safety 
and efficacy in children with CRSwNP below the age of 18 years have not been established (see 
section 5.2). No data are available. The proposed wording is acceptable. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
The applicant proposed to add the following information to the SmPC: No dose adjustment is 
recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.1). In the subgroup analysis Age group (<65, ≥65 
years) no differences in the efficacy were seen.  The proposed wording is acceptable  
Body weight 
The applicant proposed to add the following information to the SmPC: No dose adjustment for body 
weight is recommended in adults with atopic dermatitis or CRSwNP (see section 5.2). In the 
subgroup analysis baseline weight (<70, ≥70- < 90, ≥ 90 kg; <60, ≥ 60 kg) no differences in the 
efficacy were seen. However, considering that exposure is significantly associated with the body 
weight (e.g  at the proposed dose of 300 mg q2w, exposures were ~60% higher and ~35% lower 
in patients weighing 53 kg and 110 kg, respectively, compared to a typical 79 kg patient) further 
discussion on the efficacy results was requested in patients with very high body weight. In 
conclusion, the effect of body weight on exposure is not considered to be clinically important. The 
absence of a dosing recommendation in the SmPC with regard to body weight was therefore 
considered justified. Updated information is provided in section 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect the 
limited information.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results from the pivotal Phase 3 studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280) demonstrated that 
the 300 mg q2w dose regimen provided statistically significant improvements in NPS and NC at 
both Week 24 (EFC14146 and EFC14280) and at Week 52 (EFC14280) compared to placebo, in 
adult patients with CRSwNP who were inadequately controlled with intranasal corticosteroids.  
Based on the improvements seen in the primary and secondary endpoints of the pivotal studies, it 
is agreed that dupilumab is effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis 
(CRSwNP).  
The agreed posology is an initial dose of 300 mg followed by 300 mg given every other week. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Duplilumab is approved in EU and US in two other indications, atopic dermatitis and asthma. 
The primary safety analysis in this document was conducted using pooled data from adult patients 
with CRSwNP who received dupilumab 300 mg q2w for 24 weeks in the two pivotal Phase 3 Studies 
EFC14146 and EFC14280. In this document, the term “safety pool” is used to designate the 24-
week pooled data.  
Phase 2 Study ACT12340 was not included in the safety pool because it was a Phase 2 proof of 
concept study in a limited number of patients (30 on dupilumab) with a shorter treatment duration 
(16 weeks), and with a different dosing regimen (dupilumab 300 mg qw with a loading dose of 600 
mg on Day 1) that was not evaluated in Phase 3. All safety data from Study ACT12340 are 
provided in the CSR that was submitted in the original marketing application for AD, 5.3.5.1 Study 
ACT12340 of that submission. The data-cut-off date of the submission dossier is 29 August 2018. 
Along with the safety pool data, supportive safety data from several other sources (including long-
term treatment [52 weeks] with dupilumab in Study EFC14280) are provided in this document. 
These sources are: 
1. Long term safety (ie, 52-week treatment period) from Study EFC14280 and data from the 
follow-up periods for studies EFC14146 and EFC14280.  
2. A summary of safety findings in Phase 2 Study ACT12340 is provided in Section 2.5.3 of the 
dossier.  
3. Any SUSAR reported in a patient who was continuing in the 12-week follow-up period (ie, after 
the 52-week treatment period) of Study EFC14280, and SUSARs reported in ongoing studies in 
other indications (AD, asthma, EoE, and allergy) are provided in Section 3.4 of the dossier. 
4. High level safety summaries of completed studies in other patient populations (AD, asthma, and 
eosinophilic esophagitis) are provided in Section 9 of the dossier. 
Integrated safety database 
The integrated evaluation of safety was assessed using a safety pool that included data up to 24 
weeks for all treated patients in the two dupilumab pivotal Phase 3 studies in patients with 
CRSwNP, EFC14146 and EFC14280 (Table 2). 
The pooled safety data comprises those from adult patients with CRSwNP who received dupilumab 
300 mg q2w for 24 weeks without data from the phase 2 proof-of-concept study due to a shorter 
treatment period and another dosing regimen. The pooling strategy is endorsed.

Patient exposure 
The dupilumab clinical development program for the treatment of patients (≥18 years old) with 
CRSwNP includes one Phase 2 placebo-controlled study (ACT12340) and two Phase 3 placebo-
controlled studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280). All studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel group studies.  
All patients randomized in studies EFC14146 (N=276) and EFC14280 (N=448) completed (or 
prematurely discontinued treatment) within the planned treatment period, 24 weeks and 52 weeks, 
respectively, at the time of the primary database lock for each study. Furthermore, all 276 
randomized patients in EFC14146 completed (or prematurely discontinued) the 24-week follow-up 
period, while at the time of the initial submission 12-week safety follow-up data from 260 patients 
in EFC14280  were not available, these data through to 16 November 2018 (last patient last study 
visit) were submitted with the responses to the RSI. No patient was exposed to treatment after the 
initial data cut-off (29 August 2018) for the initial type 2 variation. 
There is only 1 dupilumab group in the 24-week safety pool. As such, from this point forward the 
“dupilumab 300 mg q2w group” is referred to as the “dupilumab group” in the body of the report. 
However, the heading “dupilumab 300 mg q2w” is used in the in-text tables and the appendix 
tables. 
Patient disposition 
The safety pool comprised 722 randomized patients who received either dupilumab (440 patients) 
or placebo (282 patients) (Table 11). Of these patients, 425 (96.6%) patients in the dupilumab 
group and 256 (90.8%) patients in the placebo group completed 24 weeks of treatment. The 
percentage of patients who decided to voluntarily withdraw from study treatment was lower in the 
dupilumab group (1.8%) versus the placebo group (7.1%). The proportion of patients who 
permanently discontinued treatment due to treatment period AEs was lower in the dupilumab 
group (2.0% [9 patients]) compared with the placebo group (4.6% [13 patients]). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 179/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Of the 722 patients included in the safety population, 719 (99.6%) patients had at least one 
Non-missing result in the ADA assay following the first dose of the study drug and thus were 
included in the ADA population. 
Exposure to IMP in the safety pool, expressed as number exposed and in patient-years (PY) of 
exposure, is provided in Table 13, along with the contribution from each study separately. Overall 
exposure was higher in the dupilumab group (198.06 PY) compared with the placebo group 
(124.76 PY) due to the additional dupilumab treatment arm in Study EFC14280. 
In the safety pool, the median duration of treatment exposure was 168 days in the dupilumab and

placebo treatment groups (Table 14). 
Please note that for patients in Study EFC14146 the last injection of study treatment was at Week 
22 (total of 12 injections), whereas for Study EFC14280, patients continued to be treated after 
Week 22 and received an additional injection at Week 24 for a total of 13 injections. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 181/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Given that the majority of patients were 18 to 64 years of age (82.8%), were Caucasian/White 
(87.8%), and males (60.2%) (Table 17), exposure to study treatment was highest in those 
categories: 18 to 64 year of age (162.65 PY in the dupilumab group and 104.79 PY in the placebo 
group); Caucasian/White patients (172.58 PY in the dupilumab group and 111.02 PY in the placebo 
group) and male patients (121.94 PY in the dupilumab group and 72.73 PY in the placebo group). 
By region, exposure was highest in Western countries (87.61 PY in the dupilumab group and 53.85 
PY in the placebo group). Western countries included Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, 
Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the US. 
Exposure in patients with asthma was 117.28 PY in the dupilumab group and 72.38 PY in the 
placebo group and in patients with asthma and/or NSAID-ERD exposure was 124.18 PY in the 
dupilumab group and 76.05 PY in the placebo group. 
MFNS compliance 
On a daily basis throughout each study, MFNS was self-administered and the patient reported the 
amount taken in an e-diary. Mean overall compliance to MFNS during treatment was similar in the 
dupilumab and placebo treatment groups (92.04% and 92.05%, respectively). As per the protocols 
for studies EFC14146 and EFC14280, all patients were to receive 2 actuations of MFNS (50 
μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID) for a total daily dose of 400 μg. However, patients 
showing poor tolerance to BID dosing were allowed to receive a lower dose regimen of MFNS (200 
μg) once daily. In the dupilumab and placebo groups approximately 87% (630 of 722) of patients 
received BID dosing. 
Mean compliance to MFNS was similar in the dupilumab and placebo groups for patients who were 
prescribed MFNS BID at randomization (91.02% and 91.44%, respectively) and for those who were 
prescribed MFNS QD at randomization (98.51% and 96.76%, respectively). 
Demographics 
Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between the dupilumab 
and placebo treatment groups in the safety pool. The mean (SD) age of all patients (N=722) was 
51.4 (12.8) years; 17.1% of patients were elderly (≥65 years of age) and 19 (2.6%) patients were 
≥75 years. Overall, 60.2% of patients were men and 39.8% were women. A majority of patients 
were White (87.8%) and non-Hispanic (80.8%); approximately 7.6% were Asian and 2.2% were 
Black. Of all patients enrolled, 30.9% had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and 29.9% had body weight ≥90 kg. 
The enrolled population was distributed globally with 44.5% from sites in Western countries, 
29.8% from East Europe, 19.0% from Latin America, and 6.8% from Asia. 
Disease characteristics at baseline 
The patients’ disease characteristics at baseline indicate that the patients enrolled had severe 
CRSwNP, as evidenced by significant nasal polyp size, significant symptoms, poor baseline sense of 
smell, extensive sinus disease, and poor QOL. There were no meaningful imbalances in disease 
characteristics between the treatment arms. 
At baseline, the mean endoscopic bilateral NP score was 6.00 in the dupilumab group and 5.92 in 
the placebo group (range of total score is 0-8, lower scores indicate smaller-sized polyps); mean 
nasal congestion/obstruction score was 2.39 and 2.42, respectively (range of scale is 0-3, lower 
scores indicate less symptoms), mean sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) score was 50.12 and 
52.19, respectively (range of global score is 0-110, lower scores indicate less impact of nasal 
symptoms and social/emotional consequences of the patient’s nasal disorder), and the University of 
Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) mean results were 13.91 and 14.08, respectively 
(range of scale is 0-40, where a lower score indicates worse olfaction). Most patients in both 
treatment groups had extensive opacification of the sinuses bilaterally as assessed by the LMK CT 
scan total mean score, was 18.26 and 18.55, respectively (total score range is 0-24, higher scores 
indicate more sinus opacification). Mean VAS of overall rhinosinusitis severity was 7.83 in the 
dupilumab group and 7.96 in the placebo group (range 0-10, higher score indicates 
greater severity, >7 indicates severe disease). 
At baseline, 57.6% of patients in the dupilumab group and 60.6% of patients in the placebo group 
had blood eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L signifying the systemic type 2 inflammation that is typical 
of CRSwNP.

Medical history 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis 
The mean time since the first diagnosis of CRSwNP was approximately 11 years. The mean age at 
onset was 40.5 years. Overall, 63.4% of patients had undergone at least one prior surgery for 
nasal polyps: 62.0% in the dupilumab group and 65.6% in the placebo group. The proportion of 
patients in the dupilumab and placebo groups who had 3 or more NP surgeries was 23.4% and 
24.9%, respectively. Mean time since the most recent NP surgery was similar between the 
dupilumab and placebo groups 
(7.23 and 7.06 years, respectively).  
In the 2 years prior to randomization, 74.5% of patients were treated with SCS. The mean number 
of SCS courses in the past 2 years was 1.60 and 1.48 for the dupilumab and placebo groups, 
respectively, with approximately 30% of these patients receiving 2 or more courses of SCS. The 
median number of days of SCS use was 11.0 days with 37.6% of patients receiving SCS for ≤14 
days. Overall, the history of SCS use was comparable between the dupilumab and placebo groups. 
A history of epistaxis was reported by 15.5% of patients in the dupilumab group and 15.6% of 
patients in the placebo group. 
Asthma and NSAID-ERD 
Overall, 59.1% of patients had a history of asthma. The mean age at onset of asthma was 34.8 
years. The mean time since the first diagnosis of asthma was 16.9 years and the mean time since 
the last asthma exacerbation was 56.3 months. Mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 
84.12%. The mean ACQ-6 at baseline was 1.59 and the median ACQ-6 was 1.5, indicating that half 
of the patients had uncontrolled asthma. The mean number of severe asthma exacerbations in the 
previous year was 0.43. Most patients with asthma (90.8%) were on asthma medication during the 
year prior to starting study drug, with the majority (73.8%) of patients using both ICS and LABA at 
baseline. Overall, 28.1% of patients had NSAID-ERD, with a majority (87.2% [177 of 203]) of 
these patients having conditional NSAID-ERD which was based solely on the patient’s clinical 
history. 
Other type 2 inflammatory diseases 
A patient was considered to have a comorbid type 2 inflammatory disease including atopic history 
or ongoing comorbid disease if the patient had any of the following diseases: AD, allergic 
conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis (including seasonal and perennial rhinitis), eosinophilic esophagitis, 
food allergy, and/or hives. At baseline, the majority of patients had a comorbid type 2 
inflammatory disease: 79.8% (including asthma/NSAID-ERD) and 62.0% (excluding 
asthma/NSAID-ERD). The most frequently reported atopic condition was allergic rhinitis (57.6%). 
Prior medications 
Most patients (81.7%) were taking intranasal corticosteroid medications in the year before 
screening. The most commonly used prior intranasal corticosteroid medications included 
mometasone/mometasone furoate (9.1% and 38.1%, respectively), fluticasone propionate 
(14.5%), budesonide (8.9%), fluticasone furoate (8.7%), and fluticasone (4.6%). 
All patients were on a stable dose of intranasal MFNS at randomization. Most patients were on 
BID dosing at randomization (86.4% [dupilumab] and 88.7% [placebo]). For patients with a 
history of asthma, a similar proportion of patients in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups 
received any ICS/LABA controller medication within 1 year prior to screening (78.1% [203 
patients] and 81.4% [136 patients], respectively). 
Adverse events 
a) Safety pool (studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 through week 24) 
Overall summary of treatment emergent period adverse events 
The percentage of patients with at least 1 treatment period AE was lower in the dupilumab group 
compared with the placebo group (69.3% versus 73.8%). The same trend was observed for SAEs 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

(3.4% versus 5.7%) and for patients who had AEs that resulted in permanent treatment 
discontinuation (2.5% versus 5.3%) (Table 22). 
No deaths were reported in the 24-week treatment period of the safety pool. Outside of the 24-
week treatment period, however, two deaths occurred: one placebo-treated patient died due to 
suspected myocardial infarction in the post-treatment period of Study EFC14146 and one 
patient  in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group in Study EFC14280 died due to a traumatic 
intracranial hemorrhage 72 days after the last dose of IMP. These were the only deaths reported in 
the CRSwNP studies (EFC14146, EFC14280, and ACT12340).  
The percentage of patients experiencing common AEs (defined as AEs with PT incidence ≥1% in 
either treatment group) during the treatment period is provided in Table 23. The infections and 
infestations SOC had the highest proportion of patients with AEs; the incidence was 10.6% lower in 
the dupilumab group (32.0%) compared with the placebo group (42.6%) with a relative risk of 
0.70 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.85) (Table 24). The most frequently reported PT in both groups was 
nasopharyngitis (12.5% in the dupilumab group and 14.5% in the placebo group). 
The respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC had the second highest proportion of 
patients with AEs, with a 11.9% lower incidence in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo 
group (18.2% versus 30.1%, respectively), with a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.77) 
(Table 24). In this SOC, the most frequently reported PTs in the dupilumab and placebo groups 
were epistaxis (5.7% and 7.1%, respectively), cough (3.4% and 3.2%, respectively), nasal polyps 
(2.7% and 11.7%, respectively), and asthma (1.6% and 7.1%, respectively). The general 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC had the third highest proportion of patients with 
AEs (mainly due to injection site reactions); incidence was similar in the dupilumab and placebo 
groups (19.1% and 17.7%, respectively). The most frequently reported PTs in the 
dupilumab and placebo groups were injection site erythema (6.4% and 7.8%, respectively) and 
injection site reaction (3.4% and 1.8%, respectively).  
In the safety pool, TEAEs reported at a higher incidence in the dupilumab group than in the placebo 
group by at least 1 percentage point were: 
• Injection site reaction (3.4% versus 1.8%) 
• Arthralgia (3.2% versus 1.8%) 
• Hypertension (2.7% versus 1.1%) 
• Insomnia (1.4% versus 0%) 
• Conjunctivitis (1.4% versus 0%) 
• Injection site swelling (1.4% versus 0.4%) 
Injection site reactions and events of injection site swelling were mostly mild to moderate; there 
was 1 severe case. No patients had a SAE due to an injection site reaction and no patient 
discontinued as a result of an injection site reaction/swelling. All injection site reactions resolved or 
were resolving despite continued use of dupilumab.

In the safety pool through 24 weeks for treatment, arthralgia was reported in 3.2% (14 patients) in 
the dupilumab group versus 1.8% (5 patients) in the placebo group. The relative risk ratio (95% 
CI) for dupilumab versus placebo was 1.73 (0.59 to 5.03).  
Other PTs in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC that were reported in 3 
patients or more in either treatment group with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group than in 
the placebo group were musculoskeletal pain (0.9% [4 patients] versus 0.4% [1 patient], 
respectively), neck pain (0.9% [4 patients] versus 0.4% [1 patient, respectively), and joint 
swelling (0.7% [3 patients] versus 0%, respectively). 
PTs reported with a higher incidence in the placebo group than in the dupilumab group were 
myalgia (1.4% [4 patients] versus 0.9% [4 patients], respectively) and pain in extremity (1.4% [4 
patients] versus 0.5% [2 patients], respectively). Incidence of back pain was similar in the 
dupilumab and placebo treatment groups (2.7% [12 patients] and 2.5% [7 patients], respectively).  
Through the complete treatment-emergent periods across both studies, there were 22 dupilumab-
treated patients (combined groups [q2w plus q2w-q4w]) and 5 placebo-treated patients who 
reported arthralgia, for a combined incidence of 5.0% for dupilumab versus 1.8% for placebo.  
Of the 22 cases of arthralgias on dupilumab, 21 of these were mild to moderate and recovered with 
oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. Only 2 of these patients had ADA (both low titer). 
There was one severe case of arthralgia considered related to study treatment which occurred in a 
dupilumab-treated patient. This patient had a syndrome consisting of eosinophilia, arthralgia, 
asthma exacerbation and insomnia which occurred in association with reduction in oral 
corticosteroid use. 
The PT “hypertension” was reported in 12 (2.7%) patients in the dupilumab group versus 3 (1.1%) 
patients in the placebo group. No events were considered as serious, severe or resulted in 
permanent study drug discontinuation.  
Evaluation of the HLGT “vascular hypertensive disorders” which captures all  hypertension-related 
PTs in the vascular disorders SOC, showed similar frequencies in the dupilumab and placebo groups 
(2.7% and 2.8%, respectively).  
Insomnia was reported in 1.4% [6 patients] in the dupilumab group versus no patients in the 
placebo group. The events were mostly mild (5/6 cases). Most (4/6) insomnia events resolved. 
Insomnia in dupilumab-treated patients contributed to the imbalance observed in the Psychiatric 
disorders SOC overall (3.9% [17 patients] versus 0.7% [2 patients] placebo). However, there was 
no evidence for concomitant psychiatric diagnoses such as anxiety or consistent association of 
other AEs with insomnia. 
An imbalance between dupilumab and placebo was observed for conjunctivitis (1.4% [6 patients] 
versus no placebo patients). There were no cases of keratitis reported in CRSwNP patients. 
TEAEs reported at a higher incidence in the placebo group than in the dupilumab group by at least 
1 percentage point were: nasopharyngitis (14.5% versus 12.5%), nasal polyps (11.7% versus 
2.7%), headache (8.5% versus 7.3%), injection site erythema (7.8% versus 6.4%), asthma (7.1% 
versus 1.6%), epistaxis (7.1% versus 5.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.0% versus 
3.0%), acute sinusitis (4.6% versus 1.4%), sinusitis (4.3% versus 1.1%), accidental overdose 
(3.5% versus 2.5%), otitis media (1.8% versus 0.5%), lower respiratory tract infection (1.8% 
versus 0.2%), abdominal pain upper (1.8% versus 0.7%), hypertensive crisis (1.4% versus 0%), 
ear infection (1.4% versus 0.2%), nasal obstruction (1.4% versus 0.2%), intentional overdose 
(1.1% versus 0%), and otosalpingitis (1.1% versus 0%). Consistent with the clinical presentation 
and common complications in patients with uncontrolled CRSwNP and its associated comorbidity 
asthma, most of the TEAEs more frequently reported in the placebo group were related to upper 
and lower airway diseases, ear disorders, and asthma. Others, however, appear to be random 
variation: accidental overdose, abdominal pain, hypertensive crisis, and intentional overdose.

A forest plot of relative risk ratio of all treatment period AEs with PT ≥2% and ≥1% higher 
incidence in one of the groups compared to the other was provided. Three terms showed increased 
relative risk for dupilumab compared to placebo: PT hypertension, PT injection site reaction and PT 
arthralgia.  
In all cases the lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk was <1, therefore not demonstrating a 
significant difference from placebo (given the frequency of the PTs). 
In contrast, several terms showed decreased relative risk for dupilumab compared to placebo. Four 
of these, PTs nasal polyps, acute sinusitis, sinusitis, and asthma showed significantly lowered RR 
(upper bound of 95% CI of relative risk <1) suggesting a protective effect of dupilumab on 
appearance of these upper and lower airway events that are often associated with poorly controlled 
CRSwNP disease. 
Treatment period adverse events by Investigator causality 
The proportion of patients with treatment period AEs related to IMP per the investigator was 20.0% 
in the dupilumab group and 16.3% in the placebo group (cf table 25). The general disorders and 
administration site conditions SOC had the highest proportion of patients with treatment-related 
AEs. The incidence was numerically higher in the dupilumab group (14.8%) compared with the 
placebo group (12.1%). The most frequently reported PTs in the dupilumab and placebo groups 
were injection site erythema (6.1% and 7.4%, respectively) and injection site reaction (3.4% and 
1.8%, respectively).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
For approximately 93% (468/503) of all patients who had any treatment period AE, the maximum 
intensity was mild or moderate. A lower proportion of patients in the dupilumab group compared to 
patients in the placebo group experienced a severe AE(s) (3.9% versus 6.4%, respectively) (Table 
22). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 192/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Overall, the most frequently reported severe AE was nasal polyps with 8 patients reporting the 
event: 2 patients (0.5%) in the dupilumab group and 6 patients (2.1%) in the placebo group. Most 
of the other severe PTs were of a single occurrence in a treatment group.  
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the safety pool population through 24 weeks of treatment from the two 
Phase 3 studies. In the individual Phase 3 CRSwNP studies (EFC14146 and EFC14280), a total of 2 
deaths were reported. One of the deaths occurred in the post-treatment period and the other death 
occurred during the treatment emergent period. 
Brief narratives for these patients are provided below. 
• One Patient was 76-year-old male patient (placebo-treated), who never smoked and had history 
of asthma and type 2 diabetes mellitus and who experienced an AE of severe intensity leading to 
death, reported as 'suspected acute myocardial infarction' (acute myocardial infarction) on Day 
277, 122 days after last (12th) dose of IMP. Sixteen days prior to receiving the first dose of IMP, 
the patient had an AE of ‘hypertension (newly diagnosed)’. Corrective treatment included oral 
lisinopril. On Day 136 of the study (9 days after the 10th IMP injection), the patient had an AE of 
moderate intensity, reported as ‘swollen left leg due to deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal 
vein extending into the distal femoral vein’ (deep vein thrombosis). Corrective treatment included 
oral rivaroxaban with recovery on Day 253. On Day 274, the patient reported persistent 
breathlessness and his asthma inhaler was switched to beclomethasone/formoterol. On Day 277, 
the patient was found dead in his home by the emergency services. Essential hypertension and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus were considered as secondary causes of death. 
An autopsy was not performed. The event was not related to the IMP as per the investigator’s 
assessment.  
• The other Patient was a 78-year-old male patient (dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w) with a medical 
history of asthma, osteoporosis, and allergic rhinitis who experienced a severe traumatic 
intracranial haemorrhage (subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, massive brain edema, 
fracture of the right petrous bone) due to accidental fall from a bike, occurring on Day 422, 72 
days after the last (26th) IMP injection. This patient died on Day 423, due to traumatic intracranial 
hemorrhage and neurotrauma. Autopsy was not 
performed. The event was not related to the IMP as per the investigator’s assessment.  
Other serious adverse events 
In the safety pool, a lower proportion of patients in the dupilumab group compared to patients in 
the placebo group experienced SAEs (3.4% [15 patients] versus 5.7% [16 patients], respectively).  
The most frequently reported SAE in the safety pool was nasal polyps (1 patient in the dupilumab 
group versus 2 patients in the placebo group); the SAE of asthma was reported in 2 placebo 
patients only (Table 26). Most other SAEs were single PTs occurrences in either dupilumab or 
placebo groups. The SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to IMP were 
eosinophilia in one patient and EGPA (EGPA) in another patient and occurred in dupilumab-treated 
patients. These SAEs were severe in intensity and led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 
both patients. 
Two patients in the dupilumab group reported more than one SAE. One patient experienced 3 
events (oesophageal perforation, infectious pleural effusion, and septic shock), all severe in 
intensity and all due to an ingested fish bone that caused oesophageal perforation.  Another patient 
experienced 2 events (fall and upper limb fracture, both moderate in intensity). The SAEs in these 
2 patients were considered by the investigator to be not related to IMP and did not lead to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Three patients in the placebo group reported more than one SAE. One patient experienced 2 events 
(vitreous haemorrhage and lumbar radiculopathy, both severe in intensity). Another experienced 3 
events (facial bones fracture, humerus fracture, and syncope; all severe in intensity) which led to 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

permanent treatment discontinuation. The last patient experienced 2 events (wound infection and 
peripheral arterial occlusive disease, both severe in intensity). The SAEs in these 3 patients were 
considered by the investigator to be not related to IMP.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 194/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Outside of the 24-week safety pool period, there were 2 SAEs which were assessed as potential CV 
SAEs: a CV death (acute myocardial infarction, placebo) and a non-CV death (traumatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, dupilumab). There were also 2 placebo-treated patients who experienced SAEs of 
EGPA in the treatment and post-treatment periods (46 days after the last dose of IMP in Study 
EFC14280, and 87 days after the last IMP dose in Study EFC14146), respectively. 
Since the initial cut-off date for the main report, 3 additional PTs were reported with a frequency 
≥2%: tonsillitis (dupilumab q2w group), anosmia (dupilumab q2w-q4w group), and vertigo 
(placebo group). These additional PTs were added to the list due to single occurrences of AEs in the 
follow-up period and did not change the overall TEAE profile.

Treatment period adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
In the safety pool, the overall permanent treatment discontinuation rate due to treatment period 
AEs was lower in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (2.5% [11 patients] versus 
5.3% [15 patients], respectively). 
The most frequently reported AE that led to permanent treatment discontinuation in both 
treatment groups was nasal polyps (2 patients [0.5%] in the dupilumab group and 5 patients 
[1.8%] in the placebo group).  
The remaining AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were singly reported and were distributed 
across a broad range of PTs without clustering to any particular SOC. One patient in each 
treatment group discontinued due to asthma (moderate in intensity). 
Two patients in the dupilumab group reported more than one event that led to permanent 
treatment discontinuation.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 197/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
One patient experienced 5 events (eosinophilia [severe and serious], arthralgia [severe], insomnia 
[mild], and 2 events of asthma [moderate]) and all were considered by the investigator to be 
related to IMP; the patient recovered from the events. 
The other Patient experienced 2 events of nasal polyps; both were moderate in intensity and 
considered by the investigator to be not related to IMP. The patient recovered from the events. 
Two patients in the placebo group reported more than one event that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. One patient experienced 4 events (nausea [mild], chills [mild], muscle spasms 
[moderate], and dizziness [moderate]). Chills and muscle spasms were considered by the 
investigator to be related to IMP and nausea and dizziness were not considered to be related to 
IMP. The patient recovered from all of the events. The other Patient  experienced 2 events 
(palpitations [mild] and fatigue [moderate]) which were considered by the investigator to be 
related to IMP; the patient recovered from both events.  
The majority of patients in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups who permanently 
discontinued treatment due to a treatment period AE did so within the first 16 weeks of treatment: 
81.8% (9 of 11 patients) for the dupilumab group compared with 73.3% (11 of 15 patients) in the 
placebo group. A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to treatment discontinuation due to an AE in the 24 
week safety pool is provided below. 
The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was in general 
low in the dupilumab treatment and placebo groups. The dupilumab treated group reached a 
plateau after week 15 and decreased during the following weeks. No special TEAE pattern which 
could have led to study drug discontinuation is discernible. The overall discontinuation rate was 
lower in the verum than in the placebo group (2.5% vs 5.3%).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI)  
Adverse events of special interest and search criteria are listed in Table 3. An overview of the 
number (%) of patients who experienced treatment period AESIs or other selected AE grouping

events in the safety pool is presented in Table 28. The number of patients who experienced any 
treatment emergent AESIs in the safety pool was low and generally comparable across treatment 
groups during the treatment period. 
Of the observed AESIs and other groupings of interest, serious/severe infections and epistaxis were 
more frequently seen in placebo-treated patients compared to dupilumab-treated patients. 
Injection site reactions, conjunctivitis (both broad/narrow CMQs), and eosinophilia CMQ were 
reported more frequently in dupilumab-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. There 
were no cases reported for the following AESIs: anaphylactic reactions, symptomatic overdoses of 
IMP or non-investigational medicinal product, malignancy, or suicidal behavior.

Anaphylactic reaction/systemic hypersensitivity 
Anaphylactic reaction 
In the safety pool, no patient reported an anaphylactic reaction. Importantly, no patient reported 
an anaphylactic reaction at any time in Study EFC14146 or in Study EFC14280. 
Potential systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
In the safety pool, the proportion of patients who experienced potential systemic hypersensitivity 
events, which were medically reviewed, was similar in the dupilumab and placebo groups (1.1% 
[5 patients] and 1.8% [5 patients], respectively).  
Of the 5 patients in the dupilumab group, 3 patients (0.7%) experienced events (all mild) coded 
under the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC (PTs of dermatitis, exfoliative rash, and rash 
macular). One patient discontinued treatment due to rash macular. One patient experienced a PT 
of drug hypersensitivity with diarrhea and facial rash (moderate intensity) leading to treatment 
discontinuation. Within the hypersensitivity narrow SMQ, one patient in the dupilumab group had 
an SAE of EGPA. Upon medical review, this case was considered an auto-immune condition and not 
a classical immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction.  
Of the 5 patients in the placebo group, all of the events were coded under the Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC (PTs were dermatitis [n=2], dermatitis allergic, dermatitis 
atopic, and rash). The events were mild or moderate in intensity, were not SAEs, and did not result 
in permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (high level term) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 202/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Events of injection site reactions were collected as part of the safety program and serious or severe 
injection site reactions lasting 24 hours or longer were handled as AESIs in the dupilumab 
program.  
In the safety pool, the proportion of patients who experienced injection site reactions, identified by 
HLT, was similar in the dupilumab and placebo groups (13.9% and 12.1%, respectively). The most 
frequently reported PT in both the dupilumab and placebo groups was injection site erythema 
(6.4% and 7.8%, respectively). Among patients who experienced injection site reactions, 1 
dupilumab-treated patient had an event that was considered severe in intensity. None of the 
injection site reaction events were SAEs or led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
For the dupilumab group, 3.6% of patients developed injection site reactions at Week 0 which 
decreased to 2.1% at Week 12 and 1.0% at Week 24. For the placebo group, 2.8% of patients 
developed injection site reactions at Week 0 and remained at similar percentages at Week 12 
(2.9%) and Week 24 (2.0%).  
Serious Injection site reactions or severe injection site reactions that last 24 hours or more (AESI) 
One patient (014280-620-0001-00209) in the dupilumab group, who was ADA-negative throughout 
the study, experienced a severe AE of injection site reaction that lasted 24 hours or more; it was 
considered to be treatment-related but did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. No 
patients in the placebo group reported a serious or severe injection site reaction that lasted 24 
hours or more (Table 28). 
Infection (serious/severe) 
Analysis of severe/serious infection AESIs was based on events identified by the primary SOC 
‘Infections and infestations’ and assessed as severe or serious by the investigator. The incidence of 
severe or serious infections was low in both treatment groups (0.9% [4 patients] in the dupilumab 
group and 1.8% [5 patients] in the placebo group). Most severe or serious infection PTs occurred in 
single patients within a treatment group and without any apparent pattern. None of the events led 
to permanent treatment discontinuation. In 3 dupilumab-treated patients, 3 infections were SAEs: 
diverticulitis, appendicitis, and infectious pleural effusion with septic shock due to esophageal 
perforation secondary to ingestion of a fishbone. 
In 3 placebo-treated patients, 3 infections were SAEs: erysipelas, pneumonia, and wound infection. 
Parasitic infection 
One placebo-treated patient experienced a parasitic infection of vulvovaginitis trichomonal (Table 
28). The infection was considered by the investigator to be mild in intensity and not related to IMP; 
the patient recovered. No parasitic infections were reported in dupilumab-treated patients in the 
safety pool or at any time in Study EFC14146 or in Study EFC14280. 
Opportunistic infection 
One placebo-treated patient experienced a parasitic infection of vulvovaginitis trichomonal which 
was considered by the investigator to be an opportunistic infection described in the paragraph 
above (Table 28).  
No opportunistic infections were reported in dupilumab-treated patients in the safety pool or at any 
time in Study EFC14146 or in Study EFC14280. 
Potential drug-related hepatic disorders 
Two patients (both in the dupilumab group) experienced potential drug-related hepatic disorder 
AESIs during the treatment period. One patient had an event of ALT increased (>3 × ULN); values 
were 4.70 ULN (PCSA, 188 IU/L) on Day 113, 1.23 ULN (high) on Day 119, and 0.55 ULN on Day 
166. The other patient had 2 events (ALT increased and AST increased (<3 × ULN, max 65 and 87 
IU/L respectively) on Day 116; these 2 events were not PCSAs as they did not meet the criteria. 
These events were unrelated non-serious AEs and did not lead to permanent treatment 
discontinuation; both patients recovered during ongoing treatment with dupilumab without 
corrective treatment.

Pregnancy and partner pregnancy 
No pregnancies or partner pregnancies were reported in the dupilumab group. In the placebo 
group, one patient reported a pregnancy. The IMP was discontinued after the third dose as a result 
of the pregnancy. The pregnancy ended in a live healthy birth. 
Two placebo-treated patients reported partner pregnancies. For 1 patient’s partner, the pregnancy 
ended in a spontaneous abortion. The other partner pregnancy was ongoing at the time of 
database lock (Table 28). 
Symptomatic overdose 
There were no cases of symptomatic overdose reported in dupilumab-treated patients or in 
placebo-treated patients in the safety pool (Table 28), or at any time in Study EFC14146 or in 
Study EFC14280. 
Updated Safety evaluation submitted following request from CHMP with responses to the 
RSI.  
In the time between the initial data cut-off (29 August 2018) and the end of the study 
(16 November 2018), a total of 29 newly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 
21 patients in the placebo group, 42 newly reported TEAEs in 24 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w-q4w group, and 29 newly reported TEAEs in 16 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
(see below). Most of these newly reported TEAEs occurred in patients who already reported TEAEs 
up to the initial cut-off date and that were described in the main CSR. During the additional follow-
up period after the initial cut-off date, there were only 5 additional patients with no previously 
reported TEAE, who experienced at least 1 TEAE: 1 patient in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
(asthma), 2 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group (rhinitis, nasal polyps, and 
pneumonia in 1 patient and anosmia in 1 patient), and 2 patients in the placebo group (nasal 
polyps for both). 
Overview of adverse event profile: New treatment-emergent adverse events during the entire TEAE period 
reported after interim database lock - Safety population 
No deaths occurred during the period between the previous data cut-off and the end of study. 
Two patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group reported new treatment-emergent SAEs 
(acute renal injury and pyrexia; pneumonia) and 1 patient in the placebo group had a previously 
reported non-serious TEAE of nasal polyps, which was upgraded to SAE. 
During the off-treatment follow-up period after the initial cut-off date for the main CSR, there were 
9 newly reported treatment-emergent AESIs: 3 TEAEs of hypersensitivity (2 patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group and 1 patient in the 300 mg q2w-q4w group), 4 additional cases of 
severe/serious infection (1 patient in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 2 patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group, and 1 patient in the placebo group), 1 case of opportunistic 
infection (peritonsillar abscess) in the placebo group, and 1 case of potentially drug-related hepatic 
disorders (dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group). Among other selected adverse event (AE) 
groupings, 2 additional cases were reported: 1 case of injection site reaction that occurred during 
the time period for the main CSR but was reported after the cut-off date (dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group) and 1 case of epistaxis (dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w group).

Other selected AE groupings 
Malignancy 
No malignancies were reported in dupilumab-treated patients or in placebo-treated patients in the 
safety pool (Table 28). One patient in the placebo group in Study EFC14146 (outside of the safety 
period) had an SAE of anal carcinoma that was not recovered/resolved by database lock.  No 
malignancies were reported in dupilumab-treated patients at any time in Study EFC14146 or in 
Study EFC14280.  
Suicidal behavior 
No suicidal behaviors were reported in dupilumab-treated patients or in placebo-treated patients in 
the pooled safety population (Table 28). No patient reported suicidal behavior at any time in Study 
EFC14146 or in Study EFC14280. 
Epistaxis/nose bleeding 
In the safety pool, the incidence of epistaxis was lower in the dupilumab group compared with the 
placebo group (5.7% [25 patients] versus 7.1% [20 patients], respectively). None of the events 
were SAEs and none led to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Conjunctivitis (broad and narrow) 
In the safety pool, the proportion of patients who experienced conjunctivitis based on the narrow 
CMQ (Table 3) was low (1.6% [7 patients] in the dupilumab group and 0.4% [1 patient] in the 
placebo group). The most frequently reported PT in the dupilumab group was conjunctivitis (6 
patients). None of the events were serious or severe and none led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. 
In the safety pool, the proportion of patients who experienced conjunctivitis based on the broad 
CMQ was higher in the dupilumab group (2.7% [12 patients]) compared with the placebo group 
(0.4% [1 patient]).  
The most frequently reported PT in the dupilumab group was conjunctivitis (6 patients [1.4%]) in 
the infections and infestations SOC. None of the events were SAEs and none led to permanent 
treatment discontinuation. Although 6.0%, 11.4%, and 59.1% of patients reported a history of AD, 
allergic conjunctivitis, or asthma respectively at baseline, there was no apparent association of 
conjunctivitis with history of these conditions. There was one patient in the dupilumab treatment 
group during the 24-week pooled treatment period with 2 episodes of uncomplicated mild 
conjunctivitis on Day 5 and Day 23 which were unrelated and did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation. 
Eosinophilia 
As a transient rise in blood eosinophils was seen in some dupilumab treated patients in the 
development program for AD and for asthma, the protocols for Phase 3 studies EFC14146 and 
EFC14280 specified that when a laboratory test revealed an eosinophil blood count >3.0 Giga/L 
during treatment, the investigator was required to report this finding as a TEAE, even if it was 
without any associated clinical symptom(s). 
An analysis on a pre-specified grouping of eosinophilia TEAEs defined as eosinophilia CMQ was 
performed, including the HLT eosinophilic disorders (which includes the PTs of eosinophilia and 
EGPA), plus the PT eosinophil count increased.  
In the safety pool, the incidence of eosinophilia CMQ was low but numerically higher in the 
dupilumab group (1.4% [6 patients]) compared with the placebo group (0.4% [1 patient]) (Table 
36). Two TEAEs of eosinophilia were associated with clinical symptoms in dupilumab-treated 
patients. These 2 events were serious, severe, and led to permanent treatment discontinuation: 
(EGPA) and (eosinophilia).  
Brief narratives for these 2 patients are provided below. In addition, there were 5 eosinophilia 
TEAEs (4 in the dupilumab group and 1 in the placebo group) which were isolated laboratory 
findings without any associated clinical symptoms. Four of these events (3 in the dupilumab group

and 1 in placebo) were considered mild or moderate in intensity, were self-limited and did not 
require corrective treatment or IMP interruption. The fifth case was considered severe and related 
to the IMP. It occurred in a dupilumab-treated patient who recovered from this event after 
temporary interruption of treatment and the event did not reoccur after resumption of treatment. 
Across both studies through the treatment-emergent period, a total of 12 patients experienced 
TEAEs in the eosinophilia CMQ: 5 patients in Study EFC14146 (2 [1.5%] placebo, 3 [2.1%] 
dupilumab) and 7 patients (2 [1.3%] placebo, 5 [1.7%] dupilumab) in Study EFC14280 (Table 37). 
There was no imbalance between dupilumab and placebo in the occurrence of these eosinophilia 
TEAEs with or without clinical symptoms. 
While there were 2 cases of eosinophilia with clinical symptoms in the safety pool, there were a 
total of 4 cases of eosinophilia with clinical symptoms observed across the treatment-emergent 
periods of both studies, all in patients with a history of asthma. All were SAEs: 2 dupilumab-treated 
patients with eosinophilia and EGPA in the 24-week safety pool period and 2 placebo-treated 
patients with EGPA outside of the 24-week safety pool period. One of these placebo-treated 
patients had been given a single dose of dupilumab more than 300 days before the onset of EGPA. 
An additional patient had a TEAE of eosinophilia associated with severe arthralgia.  
Cardiovascular events (Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 (all study periods)) 
Serious AEs in the cardiac disorders SOC, nervous system disorders SOC, vascular disorders SOC, 
with a PT of pulmonary embolism, and any event with an outcome of death, regardless of cause or 
timing, were submitted to the independent Cardiovascular Classification Process for a final 
assessment of the events.  
Table 38 presents serious events that occurred at any time (ie, pre-treatment, on-treatment, and 
post-treatment) in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280. A total of 10 serious cases were submitted for 
blinded cardiologist review of which 3 (0.7%) cases were in dupilumab-treated patients and 7 
(2.5%) cases were in placebo-treated patients. None of the events were considered by the 
investigator to be related to IMP.

In placebo-treated patients, 4 of the 7 cases were assessed as CV events. The reported PTs were: 
acute myocardial infarction , peripheral arterial occlusive disease, syncope, and aortic valve 
stenosis. The other 3 cases were assessed as non-CV events: hypertension, lumbar radiculopathy 
and temporal lobe epilepsy. 
In dupilumab-treated patients, 1 of the 3 cases was assessed as a CV event. The reported PT was 
acute myocardial infarction, which was nonfatal. The other 2 cases were assessed as non-CV 
events: traumatic intracranial haemorrhage  [dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w]) and carpal tunnel 
syndrome. 
The only events categorized as MACE were the 2 myocardial infarctions. Two of the 10 serious 
cases were fatal of which one was assessed as a CV death  [placebo]; acute myocardial infarction 
and one was assessed as a non-CV death  [dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w]; traumatic intracranial 
haemorrhage. These 2 cases are presented in Section (Deaths).  
Adverse Drug Reactions 
The primary assessment for ADRs was conducted in the 24-week safety pool (Studies EFC14146 
and EFC14280). Analysis was based on individual PTs and selected AE groupings (predefined 
SMQs/CMQs) in the pooled 24-week safety population (N=722 subjects).  
The threshold for TEAEs selection was based on ≥1% incidence in the dupilumab group and ≥1% 
difference versus placebo.  
ADRs were identified from PTs that had a lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk >1 compared 
to placebo. These ADRs were then selected for fatal outcome, seriousness and severity criteria, 
followed by impact on IMP administration (ie, resulted in treatment discontinuation). 
As shown in Figure 2, none of the PTs met the ADR criteria (≥1% incidence with ≥1% difference 
and lower bound of the 95% CI of relative risk >1) suggesting no quantitative difference from 
placebo. Similarly, no events fulfilled the qualitative criteria for ADR in the dupilumab group based 
on medical judgement of causality. As noted, no new ADRs were identified in the CRSwNP program 
using these criteria. Amongst 
ADRs observed in dupilumab-treated patients in the AD and/or asthma programs, injection site 
reactions and conjunctivitis are considered ADRs in the CRSwNP program. In the CRSwNP program, 
these events also demonstrated an imbalance in the dupilumab group(s) compared to the placebo 
group, though the rate of these ADRs was lower as compared with the other dupilumab clinical 
programs. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 207/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Injection site reactions were observed more frequently in the dupilumab group versus placebo, 
with the PTs of injection site reaction and injection site swelling meeting the criteria of ≥1% 
incidence and ≥1% difference versus placebo. Injection site reactions associated with injectable 
therapeutics are unlikely to be disease-specific. Therefore, given the existing ADRs of injection site 
reactions in the asthma and AD programs, these 2 PTs are selected as ADRs in the CRSwNP 
program. 
Similarly, conjunctivitis (narrow and broad CMQs) was observed more frequently in the dupilumab 
group versus placebo, with PT of conjunctivitis meeting the criteria of ≥1% incidence and ≥1% 
difference versus placebo. None of the events of conjunctivitis were severe or serious, or required 
permanent treatment discontinuation. All recovered on topical treatment or antibiotics. Overall 
incidence of conjunctivitis is similar to what was seen in asthma (albeit the placebo incidence being 
higher than dupilumab in the asthma program) and less than that observed in AD. In light of the 
fact that conjunctivitis had previously been identified as an ADR in the AD program and in the 
absence of an alternative etiology, this PT is selected as an ADR in the CRSwNP program. 
In the safety pool, an imbalance was observed for the eosinophilia CMQ, which was primarily driven 
by a protocol-specified requirement to report these AEs in the setting of a laboratory abnormality 
regardless of demonstrated clinical symptoms. As discussed in sections above, the vast majority of 
these eosinophilia TEAEs were not symptomatic and suffered no clinical consequences. While there 
were 2 cases of eosinophilia with clinical symptoms in dupilumab-treated patients in the safety 
pool, there were no differences across the complete treatment-emergent periods of both studies, in 
either symptomatic or asymptomatic eosinophilia TEAEs in patients treated with dupilumab 
compared to placebo. Therefore, eosinophilia is not considered an 
ADR with dupilumab in the CRSwNP program. 
In the safety pool and through the complete treatment-emergent periods of the two Phase 3 
studies, there was no imbalance in hypersensitivity reactions in the CRSwNP program and no 
anaphylaxis reactions or serum sickness cases were reported. Dupilumab therapy in patients with

CRSwNP was not associated with increased risks of infections (bacterial, viral, opportunistic, or 
parasitic), malignancies, or hepatobiliary disorders. Serious CV cases were rare and not imbalanced 
after dupilumab treatment as compared with placebo in the CRSwNP studies. The incidence of 
herpes viral infection, eosinophilic disorders/eosinophil count increased, hepatobiliary disorders, 
and cardiac disorders was similar or less than that observed in dupilumab-treated patients within 
the safety pools for the asthma and AD programs. There were no rare events that met the criteria 
for ADR. Based on the above, the ADRs for the dupilumab-treated patients in the CRSwNP program 
are provided in Table 39. 
Looking at the ADRs for CRSwNP in the 52-week Study EFC14280, conjunctivitis was reported in 
1.7% (5/297), injection site reaction in 4.4% (13/297), and injection site swelling in 2.4% (7/297) 
of patients in the dupilumab groups versus 0.7% (1/150), 2.0% (3/150), and 0% of patients in the 
placebo group, respectively. 
b) Study ACT12340 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 55 patients in total; 30 (100%) patients in the dupilumab 
group  and  25  (83.3%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and 
resolved by the end-of-study. No deaths were reported during the treatment period; one patient died 
during the screening period (before receiving IMP). Permanent treatment discontinuation of study 
drug due to a TEAE was reported by 7 patients in total, of these, 5 were placebo patients. 
The most frequently reported PTs in the dupilumab group included nasopharyngitis (46.7%), injection 
site  reaction  (40.0%),  epistaxis  (23.3%),  orophayngeal  pain  (23.3%),  headache  (20.0%),  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  (13.3%),  dizziness  (10.0%),  and  back  pain  (10.0%),  while  the  most 
frequently reported PTs in the placebo group included nasopharyngitis (33.3%), headache (16.7%), 
bronchitis  (13.3%),  nasal  polyps  (10.0%),  upper  airway  cough  syndrome  (10.0%),  and  asthma 
(10.0%) (Table 10).  
A  total  of  14  patients  reported  any  injection  site  reaction;  2  (6.7%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  12 
(40.0%) in the dupilumab group. One patient in the dupilumab group discontinued from the study 
due to a moderate injection site reaction. Injection site reaction in this patient recovered 5 days after 
the onset  of  the  event  without  any  corrective  treatment.  Overall,  injection  site  erythema  was  the 
most frequently reported sign/symptom, followed by injection site pain.  
Four patients in the dupilumab 300 mg treatment group had ≥4 episodes of injection site reactions 
compared to none in the placebo group. Imbalances for epistaxis and oropharyngeal pain were also 
observed in this study, 7 patients (23.3%) in the dupilumab group compared with 2 (6.7%) patients 
in the placebo group for both PTs (Table 10). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 209/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 6 patients experienced SAEs: 2 in the dupilumab group and 4 in the placebo group. Of the 
2 patients in the dupilumab group who experienced SAEs, 1 patient reported an SAE of herpes zoster 
(located at the right upper arm) that was also considered an AESI and the other patient reported 
SAEs of arrhythmia, pain in extremity, hypoaesthesia, and mononeuropathy. The placebo patients 
reported SAEs of nasal polyps, uterine cancer, transient ischemic attack, and asthma (verbatim term 
[asthma  exacerbation]).  All  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  the  study 
drug by the investigator. 
Adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
Withdrawal of study treatment due to a TEAE was reported for relatively few patients (n=7;2 patients 
in the dupilumab group and 5 patients in the placebo group). Among those, 1 patient in the dupilumab 
group  reported  a  severe  drug-related  TEAE  (constipation)  and  1  patient  in  the  dupilumab  group 
reported a moderate drug-related TEAE (injection site reaction). Two patients in the placebo group 
reported TEAEs of asthma (1 event was a serious event). Discontinuation of study treatment for 1 
placebo-treated  patient  was  due  to  several  TEAEs  (hypertension,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  and 
bronchitis) with 3 out of those 4 that resolved with corrective treatment. Other reasons for permanent 
drug discontinuation in the placebo group were hypersensitivity (n=1) and otitis media (n=1).

Adverse events of special interest 
In  this  study,  the  prespecified  AESIs  were  anaphylactic  or  acute  allergic  reactions  requiring 
immediate  treatment,  severe  injection  site  reactions  that  lasted  for  >24  hours,  severe/serious 
infections  (including  opportunistic  and  parasitic  infections),  significant  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALT) elevations, pregnancy, and symptomatic overdose. Only 1 AESI was reported and it was in the 
category of serious/severe infection (PT of herpes zoster); the case is described below.  
• One 53-year-old male patient in the dupilumab group experienced an SAE of herpes zoster located 
at  the  right  upper  arm  on  Study  Day  80.  The  event  of  herpes  zoster  was  considered  medically 
flupentixol 
significant  and  an  AESI.  The  patient  was 
dihydrochloride/melitracen hydrochloride. No action was taken with the IMP. On Study Day 153, the 
patient's herpes zoster resolved. The event herpes zoster was considered as not related to the study 
treatment by the investigator.  
treated  with  valacyclovir  and 
Eosinophilic TEAEs 
No TEAEs of eosinophilia or blood eosinophil count increases were reported. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
For laboratory results, there was no reporting of serious and/or related hematological or biochemical 
disorders. PCSAs were observed in both treatment groups for increased eosinophils (>0.5 Giga/L or 
>ULN 
[if ULN is ≥0.5 Giga/L]); the incidence was higher in the dupilumab group (43.3% [13/30]) 
compared with the placebo group (34.5% [10/29]). 
Vital signs 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  placebo  and  dupilumab  groups  were  observed  in 
vital sign parameters (SBP, DBP, and HR). One patient in the placebo group had a PCSA in supine 
SBP  of  ≥160  mmHg  and  an  increase  from  baseline  of  ≥20  mmHg.  There  were  no  reports  of 
hypotension; however, hypertension was reported for 2 patients in the placebo group that presented 
moderate and mild cases respectively. For both patients, the TEAE was not assessed as drug-related 
or serious. 
ECGs 
No  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  placebo  and  dupilumab  groups  were  observed  in 
ECG parameters (HR, PR, QRS, QTc Bazett, and QTc Fridericia). No patient reported a QTc Bazett or 
Fridericia ≥500 ms. 
Immunogenicity 
Four patients exposed to dupilumab were ADA positive during the study. No ADA-positive patients 
experienced a hypersensitivity reaction during the study. The 4 ADA-positive patients experienced 
non-allergic  local  injection  reaction  (erythema,  pain,  edema  and  injection  site  stinging).  Due  to 
limited number of patients, no safety correlation can be made between ADA positive and negative 
patients in this study. 
Safety conclusions 
Dupilumab  300  mg  qw  was  generally  well-tolerated  over  16  weeks  of  treatment  in  patients  with 
CRSwNP. The safety results did not show any relevant differences between the placebo group and 
the  dupilumab  group  except  for  a  higher  incidence  of  epistaxis  and  injection  site  reactions  in 
dupilumab-treated patients. No safety signal was raised during the study.

Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for hematology parameters (hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, RBCs, and platelets) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups during the 
treatment period in the safety pool.  
The percentage of patients with potentially clinically relevant abnormalities (PCSAs) for RBCs and 
platelets during the treatment period was low and comparable in both treatment groups. No 
patients had PCSAs for RBCs and platelets that were considered SAEs or were AEs that led to 
treatment discontinuation during the treatment period. 
White blood cells 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for WBC parameters (WBC count, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment 
groups during the treatment period in the safety pool. 
PCSA analysis 
The number of patients with PCSAs for WBCs and WBC differential counts was balanced between 
treatment groups during the treatment period except for increased eosinophils that was more 
frequently observed in the combined dupilumab group compared to placebo. The most frequently 
reported PCSA in both treatment groups was for increased eosinophils (>0.5 Giga/L or >ULN [if 
ULN is ≥0.5 Giga/L]); incidence was higher in the dupilumab group (25.3%) compared with the 
placebo group (13.7%). Two dupilumab-treated patients in the safety pool experienced SAEs of 
eosinophilia: PT of eosinophilia and PT of EGPA.  
Special assessment of blood eosinophils 
In the safety pool, a transient increase in the mean blood eosinophil count was observed at Week 
16 in the dupilumab group (0.147 Giga/L) versus no change in the placebo group (-0.007 Giga/L); 
with values returning to baseline values at Week 24. The median percent blood eosinophil count 
remained relatively unchanged for both dupilumab and placebo groups throughout the treatment 
period (Figure 3), indicating that the observed increase in mean was likely driven by a subset of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019

patients; median eosinophil changes from baseline at Week 16 were 0.05 Giga/L versus 0 Giga/L in 
the 2 groups, respectively. 
The distribution of the maximum values of blood eosinophils during the 24-week treatment period 
by treatment group was analysed. The highest value in the dupilumab group was 8.55 Giga/L 
(distribution ranged from 0 Giga/L to 8.55 Giga/L) and the highest value in the placebo group was 
2.97 Giga/L (distribution ranged from 0.01 Giga/L to 2.97 Giga/L). Patients with the 2 highest 
values in the dupilumab group were previously described cases of EGPA and eosinophilia with 
arthralgia, asthma, and insomnia. The third highest value in the dupilumab group was in a patient 
with asymptomatic eosinophilia. 
For patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts <0.5 Giga/L, more patients in the dupilumab 
group (80 of 296 patients, 27.0%) than in the placebo group (42 of 188 patients, 22.3%) had 
post-baseline eosinophil counts increased to ≥0.5 Giga/L and <1 Giga/L. Similarly, more patients 
in the dupilumab group (21 of 296 patients, 7.1%) than in the placebo group (3 of 188 patients, 
1.6%) had post-baseline eosinophil counts increased to ≥1 Giga/L and <1.5 Giga/L. No post-
baseline eosinophil counts increased to ≥3 Giga/L were observed in either group. 
A similar trend was also observed for patients with baseline eosinophil counts ≥0.5 Giga/L and <1 
Giga/L, and ≥1 Giga/L and <1.5 Giga/L). More patients in the dupilumab group (12.6% and 
21.1%) than in the placebo group (1.4% and 20.0%) had post-baseline peak eosinophil counts 
≥1.5 Giga/L and <3 Giga/L. The analysis for patients with baseline eosinophils value of ≥1.5 
Giga/L and <3 Giga/L was not conclusive due to the small number of patients in this category. In 
both studies, the median percent increases from baseline in blood eosinophil count was similar in 
the dupilumab and placebo groups. 
CLINICAL CHEMISTRY 
Metabolic parameters 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for metabolic parameters (total 
cholesterol, total protein, albumin, and creatine kinase) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment 
groups during the treatment period in the safety.  
PCSA analysis 
The proportion of patients with PCSAs for metabolic parameters was balanced between treatment 
groups. The most frequently reported PCSA in both treatment groups was for high glucose levels 
(US units: ≥200 mg/dL [unfasted]; ≥126 mg/dL [fasted]); incidence was comparable in the 
dupilumab and placebo groups (5.6% and 4.7%, respectively). No patients had PCSAs for 
metabolic parameters that were considered SAEs or were AEs that led to permanent treatment 
discontinuation during the treatment period. 
Electrolytes 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for electrolytes (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, or bicarbonate) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups during the treatment 
period in the safety pool.  
PCSA analysis 
No patients in either treatment group had PCSAs for sodium or chloride during the treatment 
period. For PCSAs of increased potassium (≥5.5 mmol/L), incidence was 1.2% in the dupilumab 
group and 2.2% in the placebo group.  No patients had PCSAs for electrolytes that were considered 
SAEs or were AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation during the treatment period. 
Renal function parameters 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for renal function parameters (creatinine, 
estimated creatinine clearance, uric acid, and BUN) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups 
during the treatment period in the safety pool. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 213/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PCSA analysis 
The proportion of patients with PCSAs for renal function parameters was generally comparable 
between treatment groups. The most frequently reported PCSAs in both treatment groups was 
increased uric acid (US unit: ≥7 mg/dL); incidence was similar in the dupilumab and placebo 
groups (21.7% and 23.3%, respectively). For decreased creatinine clearance (mild, ≥60 - < 90 
mL/min), incidence of PCSAs was similar in the dupilumab and placebo groups (16.9% and 16.8%, 
respectively). 
Two placebo-treated patients had a severe decrease from baseline in GFR (≥15 - < 30 mL/min) 
versus no dupilumab-treated patients. No patients had PCSAs for renal function parameters that 
were considered SAEs or AEs that led to treatment discontinuation during the treatment period. 
Liver function parameters 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for liver function parameters (ALT, AST, 
ALP, LDH and total bilirubin) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups during the treatment 
period in the safety pool.  
PCSA analysis 
No patients had PCSAs for AST or alkaline phosphatase during the treatment period. One patient 
(0.2%) in the dupilumab group had ALT values >3 x ULN compared with 2 patients (0.7%) in the 
placebo group. For total bilirubin, 3 patients (0.7%) in the dupilumab group had at least one value 
>1.5 x ULN compared with 3 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group. One patient (0.4%) in the 
placebo group had a total bilirubin value >2 x ULN compared with no patients in the dupilumab 
group. The incidence of lactate dehydrogenase <LLN was similar in the dupilumab and placebo 
groups (8.3% and 7.2%, respectively). 
No patients had PCSAs for liver function parameters that were considered SAEs or AEs that led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation during the treatment period. No patient had an ALT value >3 
x ULN with a total bilirubin value > 2 x ULN. Thus, no Hy’s Law cases were identified in the safety 
pool. 
Vital Signs, Physical Examination and Other Observations related to Safety 
Vital signs in the safety pool (EFC14146 and EFC14280) 
Descriptive statistics 
No relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for vital sign parameters (SBP, DBP, HR, 
weight, respiratory rate, and body temperature) in the dupilumab and placebo treatment groups 
during the treatment period in the safety pool. At baseline, the mean weight of placebo patients 
was higher than for dupilumab patients: 81.18 kg versus 80.33 kg, respectively. At Week 24, mean 
weights were increased in both treatment groups, more so in the dupliumab group (81.17 kg) 
though still lower than placebo (81.72 kg).  
PCSA analysis 
The proportion of patients with PCSAs for SBP and DBP was generally low and balanced between 
the treatment groups during the treatment period. The most frequently reported PCSA was weight 
increased (≥5% increase from baseline) with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group (13.5% 
[59 patients]) compared with the placebo group (8.9% [25 patients]). Incidence of weight 
decreased (≥5% decrease from baseline) was lower in the dupilumab group (3.0% [13 patients]) 
compared with the placebo group (7.5% [21 patients]). One patient (014280-792-0007-00206) in 
the placebo group experienced an SAE of weight decreased. This SAE did not result in permanent 
treatment discontinuation.  
ECG parameters (EFC14146 and EFC14280) 
ECG data for Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 were not pooled, but reported in each separate 
study CSR. The number of patients with an abnormal ECG was well balanced between the 
treatment groups (see below).

Anti dupilumab antibody status was determined at baseline (Day 1) and at prespecified time 
points. ADA population consisted of all patients in the safety population who received any study 
drug and who had at least one non-missing reportable ADA result post first dose. The definitions of 
ADA positive and negative patients are provided are as follows: 
• ADA positive patients = Patients with Treatment-emergent or Treatment-boosted response 
• ADA negative patients = Patients with Pre-existing immunoreactivity or negative in the ADA 
assay at all time points  
Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. 
Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several 
factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and 
underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dupilumab and 
to those of other products may be misleading. 
Dupilumab immunogenicity was evaluated in all dupilumab clinical studies. 
Given the different measurement time points and limited patient numbers in Study ACT12340, a 
summary of ADA, and NAb incidence for CRSwNP patients is provided for Studies EFC14146 and 
EFC14280 only and pooled in Table 15. 
The pool of dupilumab 300 mg q2w arms in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 is the principal 
source of data to evaluate ADA responses in patients with CRSwNP with the same treatment 
duration (24 weeks) and enables an adequate evaluation of persistent ADA responses.  
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 4.3% in the 300 mg q2w group compared to 2.1% 
in the placebo group (Table 15). Persistent ADA response was observed in 1.6% of all patients at 
300 mg q2w compared to 0.7% for placebo. Most of these treatment emergent ADA responses 
were low titer. High titer ADA response (>10 000) was observed in 0.9% of patients treated with 
dupilumab and was not observed in patients on placebo. Approximately 2.5% of all patients at 300 
mg q2w were classified as neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive compared to 0.7% in theplacebo 
group (Table 15).

The treatment-emergent ADA incidence was similar (2.1 to 4.8%) following dupilumab treatment 
for 24 weeks (300 mg q2w in Study EFC14146) or 52 weeks (300 mg q2w and 300 mg q2−q4w in 
Study EFC14280) as well as placebo treatment (0.7% to 4.8% in Studies EFC14146 and 
EFC14280). However, the proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent ADA positive response 
in the post-treatment period varied depending on the follow-up duration (13.7% for 300 mg q2w 
with 24-week follow-up in Study EFC14146 versus 2.4% for 12-week follow-up in Study EFC14280) 
and dose regimen (14.3% for 300 mg q2w-q4w versus 2.4% for 300 mg q2w in Study EFC14280). 
It is to be noted that the 24-week treatment pool does not include a follow-up period, while a 12 to 
24-week follow-up duration is included in the TEAE period for Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280, 
which explains the apparent numerical difference of treatment-emergent ADA incidence between 
the pool and the individual studies in Table 15. 
As shown in Table 16, 5.4% of patients with CRSwNP who received dupilumab 300 mg q2w for 52 
weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; 2.0% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and 3.4% 
had neutralizing antibodies. A total of 4.0% of patients in the placebo group in the 52-week study 
were positive for antibodies to dupilumab; 0.7% exhibited persistent ADA response and 2.0% had 
neutralizing antibodies. The ADA incidence was similar across the CRSwNP, AD, and asthma 
populations with respect to treatment emergent positive ADA response (5-6%), persistent ADA 
response (~2%), and neutralizing antibody response (1-3%) after 52 weeks of treatment at 300 
mg q2w. The combined ADA and NAb incidence in patients with CRSwNP, AD, and asthma is 
presented in Table 16.

Association of ADA to Adverse Events 
Although treatment-emergent ADA positive patients appeared to have lower mean exposure 
compared with that of ADA negative patients, the individual exposures observed in patients with 
low to moderate titer ADA response were generally within the exposure range in ADA negative 
patients (pooled dupilumab 300 mg q2w data in Studies EFC14146 and EFC14280).  
Markedly reduced dupilumab exposures were observed in very few patients with high titer ADA 
responses (N=3 with dupilumab concentration data including one patient who discontinued 
treatment at Week 20), with dupilumab concentrations that decreased from Week 4 onward and 
then stayed below or close to LLOQ of the assay (0.078 mg/L). Similarly, in patients who received 
300 mg q2w−q4w (Study EFC14280), an association of ADA with PK was only evident in patients 
with high titer response.  
There was no clear evidence of lack or loss of efficacy in patients who developed ADA (including 
NAb) response with low to moderate titer. Two of the 3 patients who had high titer ADAs and low 
drug concentration had an apparent lack of treatment effect. It should be noted that ADA was not 
found to be a significant covariate in the Pop PK analysis (POH0611) or in PK/PD analyses of the 
primary efficacy endpoints (Study POH0687). The safety profile in patients with a positive ADA 
status appeared similar to that of patients with a negative ADA status. 
Overall, the ADA response in CRSwNP patients is consistent with that observed for asthma and AD 
patients at the same dupilumab dose and treatment duration (300 mg q2w for 52 weeks) as 
reported in the original marketing application for AD and the subsequent application for asthma. 
Analyses of AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation by 
MedDRA primary SOC and PT were performed for subgroups of patients based on ADA response 
status. Additionally, focused analyses evaluated the association of hypersensitivity, injection site 
reaction and serious or severe injection site reactions that lasted 24 hours or more by ADA 
response status.  
Overview of treatment period AEs in the safety pool (studies EFC14146 and EFC14280) 
An overview of AEs according to ADA response in the safety pool is provided in Table 50. The 
limited number of patients with an ADA response made it difficult to draw any conclusion on the 
potential influence of treatment-emergent ADA response on the incidence of AEs.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 217/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
There was no apparent imbalance in AE incidence in the few ADA-positive patients (N=26) 
compared with the ADA-negative patients (N=693). Of the 26 patients who were ADA-positive, 17 
patients had AEs, with no apparent pattern or increase in incidence in the few ADA-positive 
patients compared with the ADA-negative.  
A total of 2 ADA-positive patients in the dupilumab group had treatment period AEs that led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. In the placebo group, the incidence of permanent treatment 
discontinuation was higher in ADA negative patients compared to ADA-positive patients (15 [5.5%] 
versus 0).  
In the dupilumab group, 1 ADA-positive patient was diagnosed with EGPA on Day 8 after receiving 
only one dose of IMP that was reported as an SAE. This event was considered serious and resulted 
in permanent treatment discontinuation. One ADA-positive patient in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group discontinued treatment due to lupus-like syndrome.  This was a 53-year-old man with no 
history of autoimmune disease or lupus who presented with a photosensitive macular rash and 
digital skin cracks reminiscent of ‘mechanics hands’ on Day 57 (12 days after the 4th IMP 
injection). He had no systemic symptoms or signs. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of 
anti-SSA autoantibodies (anti-Sjogren’s–syndrome-related antigen A). He was ADA negative 
around the time of the event and had an indeterminate low titer ADA response (60) on Day 166. 
Concomitant medications included mometasone furoate nasal spray, codeine, paracetamol, 
atorvastatin calcium, levothyroxine sodium, telmisartan, and cophenylcaine. No corrective 
treatment was given. IMP was permanently discontinued; the last administration was on Day 71 
(12 days after the 5th IMP injection). At last visit, the facial rash had also improved significantly; 
the patient subjectively reported an improvement of 80%. At the time of the last report, the 
patient had not recovered from the event of lupus-like syndrome but was in stable condition. Both 
the investigator and the Sponsor assessed the event as possibly related to the IMP.  
The number (%) of patients with at least one AE with incidence ≥5% in either group in the overall 
population is provided in Table 51. Few events were reported in ADA-positive patients in the 
dupilumab and placebo treatment groups. The following PTs were reported in dupilumab ADA-
positive patients: nasal polyps (3 patients), headache (2 patients), epistaxis and asthma (1 patient 
for each). For placebo ADA-positive patients 2 patients reported a headache.

Hypersensitivity reactions (blinded medical review) 
One ADA-positive patient in the dupilumab group experienced a PT of EGPA which was identified 
within the hypersensitivity narrow SMQ . Upon medical review, this case was considered an auto-
immune condition and not a classical immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction.  
Injection site reactions 
Among the 26 ADA-positive patients across both treatment groups, only 1 patient experienced an 
injection site reaction. Patient No. 014280-036-0003-00210 had injection site pruritus on Days 30 
and 45 and had an indeterminate low titer ADA response (60) on Day 166 (95 days after 
discontinuing treatment due to lupus-like syndrome – described above). 
The table below summarizes the frequency of injection site reactions by ADA status for both the 
placebo and dupilumab treatment groups. The single ADA-positive patient with any injection site 
reaction had mild injection site pruritus; there were no ADA-positive dupilumab-treated patients 
with moderate or severe injection site reactions. In the placebo group there were no ADA-positive 
patients with injection site reactions.

Only 1 patient (014280-620-0001-00209, dupilumab group) had a serious or severe injection site 
reaction that lasted more than 24 hours. This patient was ADA negative. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors (safety pool) 
Adverse events 
Dupilumab treatment was not associated with an increase in the proportion of patients with 
treatment period AEs compared with placebo treatment for demographic subgroup categories. The 
number of patients in the category Black/of African descent were too few to draw any meaningful 
conclusions.  Dupilumab treatment was not associated with an increase in the proportion of 
patients with treatment period AEs compared with placebo regardless of baseline level of 
eosinophils. 
SAEs, AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation, and AEs of special interest and other 
selected AE groupings 
Overall, a small number of patients experienced treatment-period SAEs, AEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation, or AESIs or AEs in other selected groupings. Meaningful analyses of 
these AEs by subgroups defined by intrinsic factors (ie, baseline demographics, baseline blood 
eosinophil count, and baseline disease characteristics) were not possible.  
Overview of adverse event profile by age groups 
Because there was only one patient in the ≥85 years category, that age category is not provided in 
Table 57. The 85-year-old patient was in the placebo group; he experienced TEAEs of 
nasopharyngitis, 3 events of hypertensive crisis (verbatim term: worsening of pre-existing 
hypertension) and 1 event of hypertension (verbatim term: unstable arterial hypertension). The 
patient recovered from these events. As shown in Table 57, overall incidence of AEs, SAEs, and 
discontinuations due to AEs increased with age. In both subgroups of patients <65 years old and 
≥65 years old, the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs was lower in the 
dupilumab group compared to the placebo group.

Extrinsic factors (safety pool) 
The incidence of any treatment period AE, SAE, AE leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation, and any AESI/other selected AE grouping (SMQ/CMQ) by category was assessed 
for extrinsic factors using the same methodology as described for intrinsic factors.  
Extrinsic factors were: 
• Region (Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Western Countries) 
• Territory (North America, European Union, Rest of World) 
Adverse events 
Dupilumab treatment was not associated with an increase in the proportion of patients with 
treatment period AEs compared with placebo treatment for extrinsic subgroup of region and 
territories. 
SAEs, AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation, and AEs of special interest and other 
selected AE groupings 
The same applies for extrinsic factors of Region and Territory (ie, meaningful comparisons were not 
possible due to the small number of patients who experienced SAEs, AEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation, and AEs of special interest and other selected AE groupings). 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
No pregnancies or partner pregnancies were reported in Study ACT12340. Due to the small number 
of pregnancies in patients exposed to dupilumab in the clinical studies, the current data are 
insufficient to inform the pregnancy risks associated with dupilumab exposure. Available data to 
date provide no evidence that dupilumab has an adverse effect on pregnancy or pregnancy 
outcomes. 
In order to acquire more data on any effects on pregnancy associated with dupilumab exposure, a 
pregnancy registry has been established to compare the pregnancy outcome, between patients 
with and patients without dupilumab treatment. 
Overdose 
No cases of symptomatic overdose with IMP were reported in the pooled safety population or in 
supportive Study ACT12340. 
Drug abuse 
Based on the reported TEAEs in the dupilumab clinical studies (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP 
indications) and postmarketing data, there is no suggestion that dupilumab affects central nervous 
system activity or is associated with signs of drug abuse. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
In Study EFC14146, post-treatment AE incidence was similar in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
and placebo groups. The most frequently reported post-treatment AEs were nasal polyps and 
nasopharyngitis in the dupilumab and placebo groups. Overall AE rates were lower than observed 
during the 24 week treatment period in both groups. 
In Study EFC14280, which has ongoing follow-up, post-treatment AE incidence was higher in the 
placebo group than in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and the dupilumab 300 mg q2w-q4w groups. 
Overall AE rates were lower than observed during the treatment period. There does not appear to 
be an increased incidence of AEs after withdrawal of dupilumab treatment.

Treatment-emergent adverse events comparison in the atopic dermatitis, 
asthma, and CRSwNP studies - safety pools 
In only one asthma study (EFC13579), a numerical imbalance between dupilumab and placebo was 
observed for SAEs under (MedDRA SOC) cardiac disorders (0 of 634 in placebo, 4 of 631 [0.6%] in 
the 200 mg q2w and 10 of 632 [1.6%] patients in 300 mg q2w dupilumab group). 
However, a broad database search for CV events followed by a blinded adjudication analysis by 3 
independent  cardiologists  did  not  support  a  notable  difference  in  the  safety  profile  between 
dupilumab and placebo for MACE, MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina events, as well as 
for CV deaths. A similar imbalance has not been observed in any other placebo controlled study in 
asthma, AD, or CRSwNP. 
Additionally, in rare cases patients in asthma studies have reported eosinophilic conditions such as 
EGPA and eosinophilic pneumonia, which are a known disease risk in asthma and in CRSwNP but not 
in  AD.  In  accordance  with  the  disease  background,  they  were  not  observed  in  the  dupilumab  AD 
clinical trials. 
In  asthma  Study  EFC13579,  a  numerically  greater  proportion  of  patients  reported  TEAEs  under 
(MedDRA SOC) hepatobiliary disorders in the dupilumab group than placebo. A similar imbalance has 
not been observed in any other placebo controlled study, either in asthma, AD and CRSwNP. 
In addition, PTs of hypertension and arthralgia, which had higher relative risk in dupilumab treated 
patients  in  the  CRSwNP  studies,  were  compared  to  the  AD  and  asthma  indications.  The  rates  for 
these PTs were similar to those observed in patients with AD and asthma treated with dupilumab 
300 mg q2w. 
Post marketing experience 
No new significant safety concerns have been identified from the post-marketing data in the 
recently submitted  PSUR which covered the period of 27 March 2018 to 28 September 2018. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 722 patients were included in the conducted phase 2 and 3 studies (ACT12340, EFC14146, 
and EFC14280), of which 470 CRSwNP patients were exposed to dupilumab in the claimed indication. 
Thus, the safety database for the CRSwNP clinical program includes a total of 470 patients exposed 
to  dupilumab:  30  patients  who  received  300  mg  qw  (ACT12340),  and  440  patients  who  received 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w (EFC14146, and EFC14280). Of the patients who received 300 mg q2w, 292 
patients exclusively received 300 mg q2w (EFC14146 and EFC14280) and 148 patients received 300 
mg  q2w  for  24  weeks  followed  by  300  mg q4w  (EFC14280).  The  safety  database  was  considered 
adequate by the CHMP. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 222/238 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The pooled safety data comprises data from adult patients with CRSwNP who received dupilumab 
300 mg q2w for 24 weeks without data from the phase 2 proof-of-concept study ACT12340 due to 
a limited number of patients, a shorter treatment period and a different dosing regimen. The 
pooling strategy was endorsed by the CHMP. 
During all studies Dupixent was administered subcutaneously, the dosing regimen differed between 
the phase 2 study and the two pivotal phase 3 studies; therefore, the data of the phase 2 study is 
regarded as supportive safety data since it has not been included in the safety pool. Both phase 3 
studies used the approved dose regimen for the atopic dermatitis and asthma indications as per 
product information (300 mg q2 SC) during the first 24 weeks on a background therapy of 
mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS). Only patients enrolled in study EFC14280 continued the 
dupilumab treatment up to week 52, partially receiving a modified dose regimen (300 mg q4w SC). 
The primary and co-primary endpoints were consistently assessed during all three studies. The 
majority (96.6%) of the patients randomized in studies EFC14146 and EFC14280 that received the 
verum completed the treatment within the planned treatment period of 24 weeks (96.1%) and 
received 11 or more dupilumab injections (96.6%) and merely a small part of these patients 
(3.4%) discontinued the treatment prior to week 24 mainly due to adverse events (2%). The 
overall exposure was higher in the dupilumab group (198.06 PY) compared with the placebo group 
(124.76 PY) due to the additional dupilumab treatment arm in Study EFC14280. The higher 
exposure of male patients can be explained by the epidemiology (predominance of male sex and 
asthma observed in CRSwNP and CRSsNP). The IMP compliance was high and similar in both 
treatment groups (placebo 99.3% vs. verum 99.8%) as well as the MFNS compliance (both 92%). 
The demographic and disease line characteristics were fairly balanced between the treatment 
groups (placebo/verum). All enrolled patients suffered from severe CRSwNP, as evidenced by 
significant nasal polyp size, significant symptoms, poor baseline sense of smell, extensive sinus 
disease, and poor QOL with a mean time since the first diagnosis of CRSwNP of nearly 11 years 
and almost two thirds of the patients had already undergone surgery at least once. Seventy four 
point five (74.5%) of all patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids, 60% had a history 
asthma and the majority of patients (79.8%) had a comorbid type 2 inflammatory disease. The 
number of patients treated for 6 months at dosage levels intended for clinical use is considered 
large enough according to ICH E1. Hence, the patient exposure in the CRSwNP safety database is 
considered acceptable. 
Sixty nine (69%) of the dupilumab group and 74% of the placebo group had AEs during the 
treatment period. The infections and infestations SOC had the highest proportion of patients 
showing AEs with a lower percentage in the verum group vs. the placebo group (32% vs. 42.6%) 
with nasopharyngitis as predominant symptom. The most frequently reported PTs in the dupilumab 
and placebo groups were epistaxis, cough, nasal polyps and asthma, overall with a lower incidence 
in the dupilumab group. The general disorders and administration site conditions SOC had the third 
highest proportion of patients with AEs (mainly due to injection site reactions).  
Dupilumab treatment was associated with a higher incidence of ISR (3.4% versus 1.8%), as 
already observed during the AD and asthma studies and during the administration of other 
subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies, arthralgia (3.2% versus 1.8%), hypertension 
(2.7% versus 1.1%), insomnia (1.4% versus 0%), conjunctivitis (1.4% versus 0%) and injection 
site swelling (1.4% versus 0.4%). Most ISR were mild to moderate and only one severe AE case 
occurred and neither SAEs nor treatment discontinuations were recorded.  
Among CRSwNP patients the frequency of conjunctivitis was higher in dupilumab than placebo. 
Conjunctivitis is already listed in the SmPC for the AD population. This is investigated in the 
ongoing ophthalmology study described in the RMP. 
The arthralgia incidence is relatively similar to that observed during the asthma population with 
regard to the same dose (2.8%). Again, most cases were mild to moderate, one severe case was 
associated with other symptoms during steroid tapering and no significant association to ADA 
formation was detected.  
Two deaths occurred outside the 24-week-treatment period: One death occurred in the placebo 
group (suspected myocardial infarction in the post-treatment period of Study EFC14146) and one 
in the verum group (traumatic intracranial hemorrhage 72 days after the last (26th) IMP injection); 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 223/238 
 
  
  
 
both were considered unrelated to the IMP which seems plausible according to the provided 
information. Hence, no further inquiries of these two cases are prompted. 
The severe TEAE rates were low in general for both the safety pool and the placebo group. A lower 
proportion of patients in the dupilumab treatment group experienced other serious adverse events 
(3.4% vs. 5.7 % placebo group) and no distinct SAE pattern became obvious. The minimally higher 
incidence of nasal polyps and asthma in the placebo group reflects a probable protective effect of 
dupilumab.  
Dupilumab-related SAEs relate to one case with eosinophilia and EGPA which led to treatment 
discontinuation due to their intensity. Individual cases of EGPA and eosinophilic pneumonia were 
reported and recorded during asthma study LTS12551 and these patients had a clinical history 
suggestive of pre-existing systemic eosinophilic conditions or underwent steroid tapering. In 
general, eosinophilia TEAEs occurred at a higher frequency in the dupilumab groups compared with 
the placebo groups during the dupilumab development program and this phenomenon is 
explainable by the mechanism of action (see also discussion below on AESIs).  
The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was low in 
general in the dupilumab treatment and placebo groups (2.5% vs. 5.3%). Within the verum group 
discontinuation rates reached a plateau after week 15 and decreased during the following weeks. 
No special TEAE pattern which could have led to study drug discontinuation is discernible.  
AESI were numerically fairly balanced between the treatment groups: Injection site 
reactions/swelling (predefined AESI: serious or severe injection site reactions lasting 24 hours or 
longer (0.2% vs. 0% in dupilumab treated group and placebo respectively)), conjunctivitis (broad, 
2.7% vs. 0.4 %) and eosinophilia (1.4% vs. 0.4%) occurred more often in the dupilumab 
treatment group whereas epistaxis (7.1% vs. 5.7%) and infections (1.8% vs. 0.9%) were more 
common in the placebo group.  
Injection site reactions (ISR) clearly constitute the largest category of AESI, the incidence 
remained relatively stable over time and decreased after week 15, under dupilumab administration. 
Hypersensitivity reactions which include severe ISR (lasting longer than 24 hrs) are considered to 
be an important potential risk and belong to the predefined AESI on the basis of the hitherto known 
safety profile. In the AD population severe ISR were rare (1.4% in the 300 mg Q2W group) in 
general and 0.6-1.6% discontinued the IMP due to an ISR. During the AD program only one patient 
included in the OLE study (R668-AD-1225 OLE study) was presented to have experienced a severe 
ISR. With regards to the similar dose and treatment duration (300 mg Q2W, 52-week data) 14.5% 
showed ISR in general, which is a similar percentage compared with the CRSwNP population. 
No patient in the safety pool had an anaphylactic reaction and the proportion of patients who 
experienced potential systemic hypersensitivity was low and balanced between treatment groups. 
Individual cases led to treatment discontinuation (macular rash and drug hypersensitivity with rash 
and diarrhea).  
One severe treatment-related injection site reaction was experienced by a dupilumab-treated 
patient. Three dupilumab-treated patients had 3 SAEs of infection, one of them recovered with 
sequelae; these cases were considered unrelated to dupilumab by the investigator. No other 
infections were recorded.  
Moreover, no cases of malignancies or suicidal behaviour were registered.  
Conjunctivitis had a higher percentage in the dupilumab group (1.6%) compared with the placebo 
group (0.4%) but ranges around the percentage registered during the asthma development 
program (2.7% in the 300 mg Q2W group) and is generally lower than in the AD population (8%) 
although this very study population had relevant comorbidities like asthma etc.  
Special attention was focused on eosinophilia since this phenomenon is known to be associated 
with dupilumab treatment and was already discussed during the MAA for AD and asthma, it is 
therefore reflected as common ADR in the RMP and SmPC. Treatment-emergent eosinophilia was 
generally observed to be of transient nature and is attributed to the dupilumab-induced inhibition 
of eotaxin that consequently hampers the ingress of eosinophils into target tissues. The 
eosinophilia frequency observed in the safety pool was consistent to that one observed in the AD 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 224/238 
 
  
  
 
and asthma program (1%). Across both pivotal studies through the treatment-emergent period, a 
total of 12 patients experienced TEAEs in the eosinophilia CMQ, thereof were 4 SAEs and 
associated with clinical symptoms in dupilumab-treated patients (3 EGPA and 1 eosinophilia, 
thereof two considered possibly related and two unrelated), they were also severe, and led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. 4 mild or moderate eosinophilia TEAEs without any 
associated clinical sign were recorded in the dupilumab group. Therefore, an update of the warning 
section 4.4 is introduced as follows : Cases of vasculitis consistent with EGPA have been reported 
with dupilumab and placebo in adult patients with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development 
program”. 
Three cases of cardiovascular events (CV) gathered in the cardiac disorders SOC, nervous system 
disorders SOC, vascular disorders SOC, with a PT of pulmonary embolism occurred in dupilumab-
treated patients; thereof one case of MI was finally assessed as CV event and considered unrelated 
to dupilumab. Hence, no significant cardiac impact of dupilumab was observed. 
No new ADRs were identified in the CRSwNP program. Amongst ADRs observed in dupilumab-
treated patients in the AD and/or asthma programs, injection site reaction, injection site swelling 
and conjunctivitis are considered ADRs in the CRSwNP program as these events demonstrated an 
imbalance in the dupilumab group(s) compared to the placebo group, though the rate of these 
ADRs was lower as compared with the other dupilumab clinical programs. The ADR analysis, 
interpretation and classification endorsed and already covered in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No significant difference of patients with abnormalities of RBC and platelet count (PSCA) was 
observed between the verum and the placebo group and percentages reflecting changes of these 
laboratory parameters were generally lower in the dupilumab treatment group apart from Hb 
changes ≤ 115 g/L (Male); ≤ 95 g/L (Female) (1.9% vs. 1.1%). No relevant mean changes from 
baseline were observed for WBC parameters in both treatment groups in the safety pool except the 
relatively often detected increase of eosinophils with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group 
(25.3% vs. 13.7%) resulting in 4 SAEs of eosinophilia and EGPA in 4 different patients. Treatment-
emergent eosinophilia constitutes a known and already extensively discussed TEAE/AESI (see 
above). The post-baseline eosinophil counts increased in patients receiving dupilumab with baseline 
blood eosinophil counts <0.5 Giga/L rising to ≥0.5 Giga/L and <1 Giga/L (DUP 27.0% vs. PLAC 
22.3%), a greater increase to ≥1 Giga/L and <1.5 Giga/L was seen in DUP 7.2% vs. PLAC 1.6% 
suggesting a moderate and transient effect of dupilumab on eosinophil counts. No adverse effects 
on clinical chemistry parameters (metabolic parameters, electrolytes, renal and liver function 
parameters) were recorded.  
No relevant changes as to vital signs or physical examinations were registered.  
Overall, approximately 4% of study subjects in the 24 weeks safety pool receiving dupilumab 300 
mg q2w and 2% of those in the placebo groups developed ADA as treatment-emergent response.  
Patients treated with dupilumab during the 52-week study EFC14280 showed a treatment-
emergent ADA response in 5% and 8%, respectively, depending on the dose regimen (300 mg q2w 
or 300 mg q2w-q4w). In comparison, patients enrolled in 24 week study EFC14146 (300 mg q2w) 
developed treatment-emergent ADA response in 15% of all cases vs. 5% noted in the placebo 
group. However, in the follow-up period for each study, ADA positive responses in dupilumab 
patients (total 40 of 415 patients across both studies) did not correlate with safety findings, with 
no temporal relationship between ADA formation and the occurrence of SAEs or AESIs. 
Within the safety pool, persistent ADA response was observed in 1.6% of all patients at 300 mg 
q2w compared to 0.7% for placebo. Most cases had low ADA titers and high titer ADA response 
was observed in 0.9-1.4% (24 weeks safety pool and 52-week study EFC14280, 300 mg q2w) of 
the patients. As seen in the asthma population, an inverse relationship between ADA incidence and 
cumulative monthly dose was observed (study EFC14280), thus, lower ADA incidence was 
associated with a higher dose frequency. Neutralising antibodies ranged between 2-3% (24 weeks 
safety pool and 52-week study EFC14280, 300 mg q2w) and 15% (EFC14146). The overall ADA 
incidence seen in the safety pool is slightly lower than in the asthma program (6%) and the AD 
program (<10% with persistent treatment-emergent ADA-positive response <2% in the primary 
safety pool).

Two ADA-positive patients in the dupilumab group had treatment period AEs that led to permanent 
treatment discontinuation and one ADA-positive patient developed an EGPA after one dupilumab 
administration which consecutively was stopped. 
Some events were reported in ADA-positive patients in the dupilumab and placebo treatment 
groups and no distinct pattern was discernible in ADA-positive study subjects (nasal polyps (3 
patients), headache (2 patients), epistaxis and asthma (1 patient for each).  
No  increased risk was apparent  for TEAEs with dupilumab treatment compared with placebo in 
any of the intrinsic factor subgroups examined (ie, age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, BMI, baseline 
blood eosinophil count, prior nasal polyp surgery (yes/no), asthma (yes/no) asthma and/or NSAID-
ERD, and NSAID-ERD (yes/no). The same applies to extrinsic factors. There does not appear to be 
an increased incidence of AEs after withdrawal of dupilumab treatment. 
Supportive data: 
During study ACT12340 all 30 included patients receiving dupilumab experienced at least one TEAE, 
thereof were 6.7% SAE, 6.7% had TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation; no death occurred.  
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  in  the  dupilumab  group  vs.  the  placebo  group  were 
nasopharyngitis (46.7% vs. 33.3%), injection site reaction (40.0% vs. 6.7%), epistaxis (23.3% vs. 
6.7%),  oropharyngeal  pain  (23.3%  vs.  6.7%),  headache  (16.7%  vs.  20.0%).  One  injection  site 
reaction  recorded  in  the  verum  group  led  to  a  treatment  discontinuation.  Overall,  injection  site 
erythema was the most frequently reported symptom, followed by injection site pain. Imbalances for 
epistaxis  and  oropharyngeal  pain  were  also  observed  in  this  study,  7  patients  (23.3%)  in  the 
dupilumab group compared with 2 (6.7%) patients in the placebo group for both PTs. 
Two patients treated with dupilumab experienced SAEs (one AESI with herpes zoster and the other 
with  arrhythmia,  pain  in  extremity,  hypoaesthesia,  and  mononeuropathy);  they  were  considered 
unrelated to the study drug. 
Overall,  2  treatment  discontinuations  were  recorded  in  the  dupilumab  group,  one  due  to  a 
moderateISR and one due to constipation.  
No TEAEs of eosinophilia or blood eosinophil count increases were reported. 
Four patients exposed to dupilumab were ADA positive during the study, all four had injection site 
reactions. In general, the 16-week treatment seems to reveal the same safety profile observed during 
the two pivotal studies EFC14146 and EFC14280. The higher incidence of ISR is explainable by the 
higher treatment frequency. 
Based on the hitherto presented and available data, dupilumab treatment seems to have an 
acceptable safety profile, since it did not lead to opportunistic infections, skin disorders, neoplasms, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders or cardiovascular 
disorders. With regard to TEAE profile, no meaningful qualitative and quantitative differences were 
seen as to short-term and long-term treatment apart from injection site reactions. No new 
identified risks became apparent in the CRSWNP population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In the safety pool, there were 6 AEs reported at ≥1% incidence and with a 1% higher incidence in 
the dupilumab group than in placebo group were: hypertension, arthralgia, insomnia, injection site 
reaction, injection site swelling, and conjunctivitis.

While  injection  site  reactions,  injection  site  swelling  and  conjunctivitis  are  known,  arthralgia, 
insomnia and hypertension are not, further information was requested to be provided. The updated 
information provided by the MAH did not lead to the need for updated information in section 4.8. 
Overall, dupilumab treatment appears to be well tolerated, including the proposed dose regimen 
and method of administration (300 mg Q2Q SC). The safety profile observed during the CRSwNP 
studies is consistent with the important identified risks mentioned in the safety specification and 
confirmed the safety profile established during the AD and asthma development programs. The 
safety profile in this indication is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.0 could be acceptable if the 
applicant implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report. The main changes include consolidation with other RMPs versions, removal of missing 
information in paediatrics to align with GVP V, removal of malignancy as important potential risk 
and amendment of safety concerns to specify subpopulations. Studies which have been completed 
and PIP studies are removed from the RMP in line with EMA guidance. Accordingly, the applicant 
provided an updated  risk management plan version 4.1. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated 
version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion 
should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information  
Dupixent 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
As a consequence of this new indication on patients with CRSwNP, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC are  being updated to include pharmacological, efficacy  and safety data. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.  
Additionally minor editorial QRD changes on excipients to the SmPC are introduced in section 6.6 in 
the 300mg and 200mg strength accordingly. Corresponding changes are implemented in the 200mg 
strength. Consequently the Annex IIIA is updated. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the 
package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are 
minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
The MAH will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet that meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the 
label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use in a separate variation. This was 
requested by CHMP following procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/X004G.The user testing was 
submitted in variation EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0018 assessed in parallel of this application.  
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Dupixent (Dupilumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as).  
it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU;  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification 
of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by inflammation of the nose 
and paranasal sinuses, tissue oedema, nasal obstruction, and increased mucus production causing 
symptoms including nasal congestion/obstruction (NC), loss of sense of smell, and rhinorrhea that 
persist for at least 12 week. 
Current medical consensus divides CRS into two major phenotypes based on the presence or 
absence of nasal polyps: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and chronic 
rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). The clinical dichotomization of CRSwNP versus 
CRSsNP is also reflected at the molecular level, with a heterogeneity of inflammation in patients 
with CRSsNP and a predominance of type 2 inflammation in patients with CRSwNP. The diagnosis 
of CRS is established by the presence of at least two rhinosinusitis symptoms and the opacification 
of sinuses in the computerized tomography (CT) scan. The presence of nasal polyps via the nasal 
endoscopic examination determines the final diagnosis of CRSwNP. In CRSwNP, nasal polyps are 
edematous inflammatory lesions, usually bilateral, originating from the mucosa of the ethmoid 
sinus, maxillary and sphenoidal regions that protrude into the nasal cavities and obstruct the upper 
airways. CRSwNP affects up to 4% of the adult population and commonly overlaps with other type 
2 inflammatory disease, such as asthma. CRSwNP, particularly more severe variants, is associated 
with significant morbidity and decreased quality of life (QoL) making this disease clinically 
important to identify, evaluate, and treat. Asthma is a very common type-2 inflammatory comorbid 
disease in patients with severe CRSwNP ( 40% to 67%) and these patients have more severe 
CRSwNP disease characterized by high nasal polyp recurrence rates, corticosteroid dependence, 
and poor asthma control. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Available treatments for CRSwNP are limited to the chronic use of intranasal corticosteroids, short 
courses of systemic steroids when symptoms worsen and surgery when medical therapy fails. These 
treatment options have major limitations as they treat only one facet of the disease (ie, the local 
presentation in the nasal cavity), but fail to address the underlying sinus inflammatory disease, a 
critical  facet  from  which  nasal  polyposis  (NP)  originates.  The  only  available  systemic  treatment, 
systemic corticosteroid (SCS) can only be used intermittently due to well-known adverse effects with 
chronic  use.  Consequently,  the  underlying  inflammation  causing  this  disease  is  not  adequately 
suppressed by existing therapies resulting in inadequate treatment efficacy, high recurrence rates of 
nasal polyps post-surgery and overall poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Therefore, there is 
a need for a therapeutic approach. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The applicant performed two pivotal studies in support this variation application. 
Study EFC14146 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase III 
study. The study consisted of 3 periods a run-in period of 4 weeks, a treatment period of 24 weeks 
and a post treatment period of 24 weeks.  In this study a total of 276 patients with CRSwNP were 
randomized 1:1 to Dupilumab 300 mg q2w or Placebo. Two co-primary endpoints, change from 
baseline to week 24 in NPS and change from baseline to week 24 in NC, were planned with the 
protocol. Furthermore, six key secondary endpoints were planned to be tested in hierarchical order 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 231/238 
 
  
  
 
in order to account for multiplicity: 1) change from baseline in TSS at week 24, 2) change from 
baseline in UPSIT at week 24, 3) change from baseline in loss of smell daily symptoms at week 24, 
4) change from baseline in SNOT-22 at week 24, 5) change from baseline in LMK score at week 24, 
and 6) proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery for NP during the treatment period. 
Study EFC14280 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm phase III 
study. The study consisted of a run-in period of 4 weeks, a randomized treatment period of 52 
weeks, where patients in Arm B were switched to dupilumab q4w dosing regimen at week 24 and a 
posttreatment period of 12 weeks. In total 448 subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to Dupilumab 300 
mg q2w (arm A), Dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w (arm B) or Placebo (arm C). Two co-primary 
endpoints, change from baseline to week 24 in NPS and change from baseline to week 24 in NC, 
were planned with the protocol (pooled arms A+B vs. C). Furthermore, six key secondary 
endpoints were planned to be tested in hierarchical order in order to account for multiplicity: 1) 
change from baseline in TSS at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 2) change from baseline in 
UPSIT at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 3) change from baseline in loss of smell daily 
symptoms at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. C), 4) change from baseline in SNOT-22 at week 24 
(pooled arms A+B vs. C), 5) change from baseline in LMK score at week 24 (pooled arms A+B vs. 
C), 6) proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery for NP during the treatment period, 7) 
change from baseline in NPS at week 52 (A vs. C), 8) change from baseline in NC at week 52 (A 
vs. C), 9) change from baseline in NPS at week 52 (B vs. C), and 10) change from baseline in NC 
at week 52 (B vs. C). 
The patient population in the pivotal studies consisted of patients 18 years and older with high 
CRSwNP disease burden (based on polyps score) and symptoms of NC and loss of smell or 
rhinorrhea for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization (8 weeks prior to screening) despite 
therapy with intranasal corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years or sino-nasal 
surgery. 
In addition, study ACT12340 was submitted as a supportive study. It was  a proof of concept Phase 
2 multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study 
evaluating the effect of 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg given every week.  
The dose regimens for the pivotal studies were selected based on the totality of clinical evidence in 
the dupilumab program including data from Phase 2 efficacy and safety study (ACT12340) in 
patients with nasal polyps and symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The dose regimen of an initial dose of 
300 mg followed by 300 mg given every other week is considered the appropriate posology in 
patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Both pivotal studies (EFC 14146 and EFC 14280) showed a significant improvement in patients 
receiving treatment with dupilumab as compared to those on placebo. The significant difference 
between the treatment group and the placebo group was observed for the primary endpoints 
bilateral endoscopic nasal polyposis score (NPS) and nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) symptom 
score compared with placebo at week 24 and all secondary endpoints including LMK, TSS, UPSIT, 
SNOT-22.  
In both pivotal studies  statistical significance was reached for the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints 
and all multiplicity adjusted key secondary endpoints demonstrating that dupilumab treatment on 
top of intranasal corticosteroid improved endoscopic, radiologic and clinical measures of CRSwNP 
compared to intranasal corticosteroid alone. The hierarchical testing procedure remained intact 
through all endpoints tested. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/547569/2019 
Page 232/238 
 
  
  
 
In relation to nasal polyposis score (NPS) at week 24, in both pivotal studies statistically significant 
improvement was observed in the dupilumab group (arm A in study EFC14146 and pooled arm A + 
B in study EFC14280) with slightly better results reported in study EFC14146. 
In study EFC 14146 the LS mean change in NPS from baseline to Week 24 was -1.89 for 300 mg 
q2w dupilumab and +0.17 for placebo. The LS mean difference versus placebo: -2.06 with 95% CI: 
-2.43 to -1.69 (p<0.0001). The LS mean change in NC from baseline to Week 24 was -1.34 for the 
dupilumab group and -0.45 for the placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: -0.89 with 
95% CI: -1.07 to -0.71; p<0.0001). 
In study EFC 14280 the LS mean change in NPS from baseline to Week 24 was -1.71 for the 300 
mg q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and was +0.10 for the placebo group. The LS mean 
difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -1.80 with 95% CI: -2.10 to -1.51 (p 
<0.0001). The LS mean change in NC score from baseline to Week 24 was -1.25 for the 300 mg 
q2w dupilumab group (pooled Arm A+B) and -0.38 for the placebo group. The LS mean difference 
in the dupilumab group versus placebo was -0.87 with 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.71 (p <0.0001). 
The secondary endpoints showed similar improvements and support the efficacy of dupilumab 
compared to placebo. In both studies, dupilumab significantly improved the sense of smell with 
improvement noted as early as Week 2. Nearly two-thirds of the dupilumab-treated patients who 
were anosmic at baseline (UPSIT score ≤18) improved their UPSIT score to the non-anosmic range 
of >19 at Week 24. In the placebo group almost all anosmic patients at baseline remained 
anosmic. 
In study 14146 the follow-up phase showed that the treatment effect in NPS between Week 24 to 
Week 48 diminished without rebound in the dupilumab group after treatment discontinuation. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The indication granted as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids adults patients with 
severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide 
adequate disease control. 
The long term efficacy is an uncertainty as CRSwNP is a chronic lifelong disease and the current 
efficacy data remain limited over long term.  However, improvement continued in all primary and 
most secondary endpoints through the end of study treatment (Week 24 for Study EFC 14146 and 
Week 52 for Study EFC 14280) without reaching a plateau. This suggests that the maximal 
treatment effect over time has not yet been reached.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
Dupilumab treatment compared to placebo was associated with a higher TEAE incidence 20.0% in 
the dupilumab group and 16.3% in the placebo group. General disorders and administration site 
conditions SOC were reported in 14.8% in the dupilumab and 12.1% in the placebo group. 
Dupilumab vs. placebo treatment was associated with a higher AESIincidence of Injection site 
reactions/swelling (serious or severe injection site reactions lasting 24 hours or longer) (13.9% vs. 
12.1%) and conjunctivitis Customised MeDDRa Query (CMQ) broad 2.7% vs. 0.4 %). 
An increase from baseline in blood eosinophil levels compared to placebo (elevations of eosinophil 
counts >3.0 Giga/L) was observed in 1.4% vs. 0.4%. Across both pivotal studies through the 
treatment-emergent period, a total of 12 patients experienced TEAEs in the eosinophilia CMQ. Of 
which there were 4 SAEs associated with clinical symptoms, two in dupilumab-treated patients (1 
EGPA and 1 eosinophilia) and two in placebo (2 EGPA – one patient having received a single dose 
of dupilumab on day 30). They were also severe,and led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 
three patients (both dupilumab treated patients and one placebo patient). 
Overall, approximately 4% of study subjects in the 24 weeks safety pool receiving dupilumab 300 
mg q2w and 2% of those in the placebo groups developed ADA as treatment-emergent response.

Patients treated with dupilumab during the 52-week study EFC14280 showed a treatment-
emergent ADA response in 5% and 8%, respectively, depending on the dose regimen (300 mg q2w 
or 300 mg q2w-q4w). In comparison, patients enrolled in 24 week study EFC14146 (300 mg q2w) 
developed treatment-emergent ADA response in 15% of all cases vs. 5% noted in the placebo 
group. Neutralizing antibodies ranged between 2-3% (24 weeks safety pool and 52-week study 
EFC14280, 300 mg q2w) and 15% (EFC14146). 2 ADA-positive patients in the dupilumab group 
had treatment period AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation and one ADA-positive 
patient developed an EGPA after one dupilumab administration which consecutively was stopped. 
An update of the section 4.4 is introduced to include that cases of vasculitis consistent with EGPA 
have been reported with both dupilumab and placebo in adult patients with co-morbid asthma in 
the CRSwNP development program.  
Furthermore, data on long-term exposure at the intended dose (300 mg Q2W) are lacking and will 
be collected in the post approval setting as routine pharmacovigilance. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
Based  on  the  currently  available  data,  there  was  no  significantly  increased  risk  detectable  for 
dupilumab  regarding  malignancy,  all  types  of  infections  or  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions. 
However,  the  safety  profile  of  the  CRSwNP  population  has  to  be  refined  over  the  next  years  with 
more data coming from the ongoing open label extension trials in AD and Asthma. 
Long-term safety experience is limited in CRSwNP patients as the majority of the safety data (from 
pooled analysis) comes from 24 weeks of data. The pooled safety data in patients aged > 65 years 
is rather limited (79 patients) and it appears that older patients have a higher incidence of adverse 
events than those < 65 years of age in both dupilumab and placebo group. Therefore, older 
patients may be at a higher risk of adverse events, however as the data set is limited in this 
population, this remains to be further characterised post approval and no relevant update of the 
SmPC is necessary at present. The safety of dupilumab use in elderly population will be further 
monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Duplilumab will be used as an add on therapy to intranasal corticosteroids and in patients for whom 
therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control.  
Currently there is still an unmet need for systemic therapies in CRSwNP. Other systemic therapies 
applied are oral corticosteroids or surgery if the systemic therapy has failed. The multiple side effects 
of long-term use of systemic corticosteroids are well known and alternative therapeutic options are 
lacking.  
The applicant has demonstrated the beneficial treatment effects of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W as add-
on  therapy  to  MFNS  in  patients  with  CRSwNP.  In  both  pivotal  studies  (EFC14146  and  EFC14280) 
statistical significance was reached for the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline in

NPS and change from baseline in NC score at Week 24) and all multiplicity adjusted key secondary 
endpoints demonstrating that dupilumab treatment on top of intranasal corticosteroid significantly 
improved  endoscopic,  radiologic  and  clinical  measures  of  CRSwNP  compared  to  intranasal 
corticosteroid  alone.  The  improvements  in  efficacy  endpoints  including  patient  reported  outcomes 
seen in patients receiving dupilumab are considered clinically meaningful and similar in both pivotal 
studies. These improvements resulted in significant decrease of systemic steroids use and need for 
surgery.    Additionally,  the  improvement  continued  in  all  primary  and  most  secondary  endpoints 
through the end of study treatment not reaching a plateau. This suggests that the maximal treatment 
effect over time has not yet been reached. 
Intranasal corticosteroids, systemic steroids, and sino-nasal surgery have no meaningful effect on 
the recovery of sense of smell. In both studies, dupilumab significantly improved the sense of smell. 
The general and most relevant safety concerns of dupilumab identified during the CRSwNP program 
are related to conjunctivitis, injection site reactions, eosinophilia, immunogenicity, limited long term 
data  in  patients  treated  with  the  proposed    (every  two-week)  Q2W  dose  of  dupilumab  as  well  as 
uncertainties about the impact of dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes.  
Conjunctivitis  was  a  rare  clinical  symptom  and  incidences  were  lower than  AD  program.  The  long 
term  effect  of  chronic  conjunctivitis  in  these  patients  is  unknown.  Cases  of  conjunctivitis  should 
continue to be further monitored in the post approval setting in a dedidated study as described in 
the RMP. 
Dupilumab  use  was  not  significantly  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  experiencing  systemic 
hypersensitivity  reactions  in  the  CRSwNP  population  since  both  treatment  groups  had  similar  low 
incidences.   This  suggests  a  rather  low  immunogenic  potential  of  dupilumab  in  the  CRSwNP 
population; this sort of reaction was mainly locally restricted to injection site reactions. As expected 
with a biological agent, injection site reactions occurred more frequently in the dupilumab treated 
populations.  One  of  the  events  were  classified  as  severe  and  did  not  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation. Overall, discontinuation rates due to ISRs were very low. Overall, ISRs seemed to 
be mild to moderate self-limiting reactions that were well tolerated by patients.  
No case of malignancy was present across treatment groups. There is insufficient long term exposure 
data to characterise long-term safety. This issue has been discussed during the initial MA for AD and 
is part of the RMP and subject to investigation in the OLE studies.Long-term exposure at the intended 
dose of dupilumab 300mg Q2W is limited to date.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the data provided on efficacy and safety, the therapeutic need of dupilumab in 
the CRSwNP population is acknowledged and the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The benefit-risk balance is 
principally expected to be the same over the time of treatment.  
The approved indication is  
Dupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intrasanal corticosteroids for the treatment in 
adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in patients for whom 
therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dupixent is positive.

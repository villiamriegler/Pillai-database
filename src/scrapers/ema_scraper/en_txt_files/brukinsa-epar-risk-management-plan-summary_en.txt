SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR BRUKINSA 
(ZANUBRUTINIB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for BRUKINSA®. The RMP describes 
important risks of BRUKINSA, how these risks can be minimised, how more information will be 
obtained about BRUKINSA and uncertainties (missing information). 
The BRUKINSA Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet provide 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients as to how BRUKINSA should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for BRUKINSA should be read in the context of all information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report. Important new concerns or changes to the 
current ones will be included in updates of the BRUKINSA RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
BRUKINSA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance zanubrutinib. It belongs 
to a class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors. BRUKINSA works by blocking Bruton 
tyrosine kinase (BTK), a protein in the body that helps cancer cells grow and survive. By 
blocking this protein, BRUKINSA helps kill and reduce the number of cancer cells, which can 
slow down the worsening of the cancer. 
Waldenström Macroglobulinaemia 
Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) is a rare, slow growing type of cancer that begins in 
the white blood cells. In this condition, the bone marrow produces too many abnormal white 
blood cells that can overcome healthy blood cells. WM is considered a type of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), which is a rare type of blood cancer, and is sometimes called 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. WM belongs to a group of blood cancers called NHLs that affect 
B lymphocytes. It is also a rare disease that affects about 4 to 5 people per 1,000,000 in Europe 
and less than 1 in 100,000 people throughout the rest of the world. WM occurs more frequently 
in older adults, the average age at diagnosis being in the mid-60s. It is more common in men than 
women and white people are at a higher risk than black people. 
The abnormal white blood cells produce a large protein called a macroglobulin that builds up in 
the blood where it can impair circulation and cause complications. Some people with WM may 
not experience many symptoms early on when the disease is first diagnosed. However, the 
macroglobulin in WM makes the blood more viscous, ie, thick and stickier, so that it does not 
flow easily. This is called hyperviscosity which can cause easy bruising, headaches, nose bleeds, 
and blurred vision. 
In a main study involving 201 patients who had never received treatment for WM or either did 
not respond to or had come back after previous treatment, BRUKINSA was shown to be an 
effective treatment with favourable responses to treatment when compared with another 
medicine used to treat this condition. Furthermore, patients treated with BRUKINSA 
demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile in patients with WM. The average 
treatment duration was > 18 months.

Marginal Zone Lymphoma 
BeiGene 
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a group of indolent (slow growing) NHL B-cell lymphomas, 
which account for approximately 8% of all NHL cases. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years, 
and it is slightly more common in women than in men. 
There are 3 types of MZL. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is the most common 
type of MZL. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma does not start in the lymph nodes. It 
starts in the mucosa, which is a soft, moist tissue layer that protects and covers organs in 
different parts of the body. The second type of MZL, nodal MZL, starts within the lymph nodes. 
The third type of MZL, splenic MZL, starts in the spleen but can also be found in the 
bloodstream. 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are malignant 
blood disorders in which there are an increased number of white blood cells in the lymphoid 
tissue. CLL and SLL are different forms of the same disorder, differing in the location of 
unhealthy blood cells, and are treated in the same way. In CLL/SLL, abnormal B lymphocytes (a 
type of white blood cell responsible for the production of antibodies to help fight infection) are 
produced instead of healthy white blood cells, and then accumulate over time. As the number of 
unhealthy blood cells grows, there is less room for healthy cells. The combination of fewer 
healthy cells and the fact that the CLL/SLL lymphocytes are poor at fighting infections can lead 
to frequent infection, anaemia, and easy bleeding. The uncontrolled build up and enlargement of 
lymphoid tissue can occur in various sites of the body such as the lymph nodes, spleen, bone 
marrow, and lungs. CLL/SLL can be slow-growing or fast-growing. The slower-growing form 
has an increased number of lymphocytes but a normal or slightly below normal level of red cells, 
platelets, and neutrophils in the blood. This form can remain stable for years. The faster-growing 
form has too many CLL/SLL cells in the blood that block normal cell production. As a result, the 
number of fully functioning red cells and platelet levels drop lower than normal. CLL/SLL is the 
most common type of leukaemia in adults and very rarely occurs in children. It is more common 
in older people, is rare in people younger than 40 and men are more likely to develop CLL/SLL 
than women. 
Follicular Lymphoma 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a type of NHL, which is a rare form of blood cancer. FL is most 
commonly diagnosed due to enlarged lymph nodes or during imaging performed for other 
reasons. On average, FL is diagnosed in patients around the ages of 60 to 65 years. FL is slightly 
more common in women than men, and white people are at a higher risk than black people.  
Most patients with FL experience several relapses over their lifetime and some patients go onto 
develop another form of lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Symptoms 
of DLBCL include rapid progression of lymph node swelling, extranodal disease, and symptoms 
such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The factors that increase the risk of FL transforming 
to DLBCL are still being investigated.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of BRUKINSA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about BRUKINSA risks, are described below. These are risks that 
require special risk management activities in order to investigate them more thoroughly, to help 
understand how BRUKINSA can be used safely. There are 2 kinds of risks, identified and 
potential risks. Concerns are called identified risks when there is evidence of a link with the use 
of BRUKINSA. Concerns are called potential risks where this evidence is not as strong and 
where this needs further investigation. In addition, there is missing information that refers to 
concerns where information is missing or insufficient and where further evidence needs to be 
collected. Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise any risks that may be associated with its 
use. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
analysed regularly, including periodic assessment, so that immediate action relating to the safety 
of BRUKINSA can be taken if considered necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. If important information that may affect the safe use of 
BRUKINSA is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’, below.

Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Haemorrhage events have been reported relating to the use of BRUKINSA in ongoing and 
completed clinical studies. 
Such events, in addition to recommendations to prescribers regarding the use of 
BRUKINSA in patients that are also receiving treatment with anticoagulants or 
medications that inhibit platelet function, are described in the SmPC for BRUKINSA. This 
includes the recommendation to consider the benefit-risk of withholding zanubrutinib for 
3 to 7 days pre and post surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of 
bleeding. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups  
Risks include advanced age, history of bleeding, dose of chemotherapy, baseline platelet 
count, poor performance and/or nutritional status, and concomitant use of antiplatelet or 
anticoagulant therapy, especially warfarin use in the elderly population.

jirovecii infections) have occurred in patients treated with zanubrutinib. Infections due to 
hepatitis B virus reactivation have also occurred. 
Predictors of infection include advanced age, underlying immunosuppression that is 
inherent to the primary disease process, therapy-related immunosuppression, absence of 
antibiotic prophylaxis, and poor performance and/or nutritional status.

Reports of atrial fibrillation have been identified in completed and ongoing clinical 
studies, particularly in patients with a history of cardiac disease and known cardiac risk 
factors (eg, hypertension, previous history of atrial fibrillation and concurrent active 
infections). Atrial fibrillation is described in the current prescribing information for 
ibrutinib. 
Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder. Atrial fibrillation is more 
common in men than women. There are also indications that individuals of white 
European descent have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation compared with individuals of 
other races. Most patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter had known risk factors in addition 
to age, including a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, pre-existing cardiovascular 
disease, or concurrent infection.

Risk factors and 
risk groups  
BRUKINSA was not genotoxic in studies evaluating gene mutations in bacteria (Ames 
assay), was not clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow erythrocyte micronucleus assay in 
rats, nor was it clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary 
cells. No malignancy or premalignancy was identified in rat repeated-dose studies for 
26 weeks and in dog repeated-dose studies for 39 weeks. No carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted.  
Zanubrutinib has a favourable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with short half-life and shows 
a lack of accumulation in the skin or other tissues in absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion studies with 14C-zanubrutinib. In addition, 14C-zanubrutinib related material 
was not extensively associated with melanin in rats. In summary, preclinical data do not 
describe any risk that zanubrutinib may be carcinogenic. 
Second primary malignancies (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) have been reported 
in patients participating in ongoing and completed clinical studies of BRUKINSA. 
The risk of developing a second malignancy depends on several factors, including type of 
primary cancer, age at diagnosis, sex, types of therapy given, environmental exposures, 
genetic predisposition, and health decisions. Radiation has long been associated with the 
development of primary cancers and, when used as treatment, imparts a risk for the 
development of a second cancer. Risk factors that may increase the risk of second primary 
malignancies in patients with haematological malignancies include immune dysregulation, 
the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. In 
patients with CLL, proposed risk factors for second primary malignancy include 
environmental and occupational exposures, genetic risk factors, immune dysfunction 
inherent to the disease itself, and deoxyribonucleic acid damage from prior chemotherapy 
(Bond et al 2020), which are independent of BRUKINSA exposure. In a retrospective 
review of electronic medical records from The Ohio State University Comprehensive 
Cancer Center, the risk of second primary malignancies from a large cohort of patients

Important Potential Risk: Second primary malignancies (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) 
with CLL who were previously treated with a BTK inhibitor (545 ibrutinib-treated patients 
and 146 acalabrutinib-treated patients) between 2009 and 2017, was 2.2-fold (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 2.9) higher than that expected in the general population 
(Bond et al 2020). On multivariable analysis, smoking was associated with increased 
second primary malignancy risk (hazard ratio 2.8 [95% CI: 1.6 to 4.8]) and higher baseline 
CD8 count was associated with lower second primary malignancy risk (hazard ratio 0.9 for 
2-fold increase [95% CI: 0.8 to 0.9]). Together, these data indicate that CLL patients 
treated with BTK inhibitors remain at increased risk for second primary malignancies.

Risk factors and

BRUKINSA was not genotoxic in studies evaluating gene mutations in bacteria (Ames 
assay), was not clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow erythrocyte micronucleus assay in 
rats, nor was it clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary 
cells. In vivo animal studies did not identify premalignant lesions at any site including the 
skin. 14C-zanubrutinib demonstrated no accumulation in skin and BRUKINSA was not 
associated with melanocytes. The risk of phototoxicity was low in clinical studies.  
No malignancy was identified in rat repeated-dose studies for 26 weeks and in dog 
repeated-dose studies for 39 weeks. No carcinogenicity studies were conducted.  
The most frequent second primary malignancy reported in BRUKINSA clinical studies 
was skin cancer. Skin cancers were observed predominantly in patients at high risk of 
developing skin cancer (white, elderly males from Australia, which has a high known 
prevalence of skin cancers). Second primary skin cancers were not observed in patients of 
Asian origin, or in any nonwhite patient, confirming that race and geographic location are 
the main drivers of non-melanoma skin cancer generation. 
An individual’s risk of developing skin cancer depends on both constitutional and 
environmental factors. The constitutional risk factors of skin cancer include family history, 
red hair colour, melanocytic nevi, and sun exposure sensitivity (Gandini et al 2005), 
whereas solar ultraviolet radiation is a well-established environmental risk factor 
(Gandini et al 2005; Armstrong et al 1997). Sunlight can also cause immunosuppression 
(Onajin and Brewer 2012; Brin et al 2014). Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer 
in light-skinned populations around the world (Breitbart et al 2006), with skin cancers 
most frequent in Australia/New Zealand with an age adjusted standardised rate of 295.9 in 
100.000, followed by Northern America (113.7), and Western Europe (52.9). Basal cell 
carcinoma, the most common malignancy in white people accounting for 80% to 85% of 
all non-melanoma skin cancers, has a higher occurrence in men than women, consistent 
with greater sun exposure (often occupational) (Diepgen and Mahler 2002). Albert et al 
(1990) describe incidence rates 16-fold greater in Caucasians than African Americans and 
> 10-fold than that observed in Hispanics.

There is drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential between BRUKINSA and other 
concomitant medications, particularly those with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. 
The DDI potential of BRUKINSA was assessed in 3 dedicated clinical DDI studies: 
BGB-3111-104, BGB-3111-108 and BGB-3111-113. In addition, a physiologically based 
PK model was developed to predict the effect of moderate and mild CYP3A inhibitors and 
CYP3A inducers on the PK of BRUKINSA. 
The DDI potential of zanubrutinib coadministered with a moderate CYP3A inducer was 
assessed in Study BGB-3111-112, an open-label, fixed-sequence study in healthy male 
subjects. It investigated the effect of CYP3A induction by steady-state rifabutin on the 
single-dose PK of zanubrutinib. Statistical analysis demonstrated that systemic exposure to 
zanubrutinib was moderately lower after coadministration of 320 mg zanubrutinib with 
300 mg rifabutin than after administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone, with geometric 
mean AUC approximately 44% lower and Cmax approximately 48% lower. This represents 
a decreased exposure of 1.8-fold for AUC0-∞, and 1.9-fold for Cmax. 
In Study BGB-3111-113, the magnitude of the DDI between zanubrutinib and moderate 
(diltiazem, fluconazole) and strong (clarithromycin, voriconazole) CYP3A inhibitors was 
further evaluated in patients with B-cell malignancies. Zanubrutinib steady-state exposures 
upon concurrent administration with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (under the 
2-fold or 4-fold dose reduction per zanubrutinib prescribing information) were lower than 
exposures at the 320 mg once-a-day dose of zanubrutinib. Overall, the safety findings were 
consistent with the safety profile of zanubrutinib and no changes to the dosing 
recommendations for use of zanubrutinib with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors was 
considered necessary. 
BRUKINSA is metabolised primarily by CYP3A enzymes and a clinical DDI study and 
physiologically based PK simulations show that strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or 
inducers can modulate exposure of BRUKINSA. Based on the results of the DDI studies 
and understanding of exposure-response relationships, patients receiving medications that 
act as moderate to strong CYP3A inducers are at risk of DDIs.

Embryo-foetal development toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and rabbits. 
Malformations in the heart (2- or 3-chambered hearts at the incidence of 0.3% to 1.5%) 
were noted at all dose levels (in the absence of maternal toxicity) when administered orally 
to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. Administration of BRUKINSA to 
pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in postimplantation loss at the 
highest dose, but no teratogenicity was noted in this study. Embryo-foetal toxicity may

data and post-marketing experience with the product. 
and PL 
following the MAH’s review of the available data supporting 
The corresponding sections of the Labelling and 
Package Leaflet have been updated. The product 
information has also been updated in accordance with 
the recommendations of the SmPC Guideline and the 
latest QRD template version 9. Local representatives 
were updated for the following countries: Denmark, 
Norway, Slovakia, Iceland, Finland and Sweden. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
the safety profile for Emadine eye drops, solution. The review 
has taken into consideration data from clinical studies and 
post-marketing experience with the product. As a result of 
the review the MAH has revised the overall safety profile for 
Emadine eye drops in section 4.8 of the SmPC the frequency 
category of five adverse events (headache, eye irritation, dry 
eye, corneal staining and blurred vision) has been reassigned 
from Common to Uncommon for consistency with the 
requirements in the EU SmPC guideline. According to this 
document ADRs with crude incidence rate between 0.1 to 1% 
(≥1/1000 to <1/100) should be assigned to the uncommon 
frequency category; section 4.6 of the SmPC the following 
sentence was added ‘Studies in animals have shown no 
evidence of impaired fertility (see Section 5.3). No human 
fertility data are available.’ and for the section 5.3 of the 
SmPC for which the following sentence was reworded to 
‘There was no evidence of impaired fertility or decreased 
reproductive capacity in rats administered orally dosages of 
Emedastine difumarate up to 30 mg/kg/day.’

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the available information the CHMP is 
II, Labelling 
of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy of 
and PL 
this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Emadine continues to be favourable. 
With this procedure the MAH also updated the product 
information. This update was based on the requirements in 
the 2005 Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) 
Guidelines and QRD requirements. In detail this meant that 
the current section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SPC, that 
was based upon 3 long-term studies, was updated to be 
based on all short-term, intermediate-term and long-term 
studies. All identified adverse events were therefore recoded 
into MedDRA preferred terms and the frequency classification 
for each adverse drug reaction (ADR) was identified. In 
addition, based on post-marketing adverse event data, the 
ADR "tachycardia" was included in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Based upon the revision to section 4.8 of the SPC, section 4 
of the PIL was subsequently updated.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Ivemend, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
During the process of evaluating a signal of encephalopathy, it was noted that more than 50% of 
the encephalopathy cases were due to a potential drug-drug interaction between aprepitant and 
ifosfamide. Due to this new signal, the MAH has initiated a cumulative review of cases in which 
ifosfamide was co-administered with aprepitant. The available scientific information suggests that 
drug-drug interactions may lead to altered ifosfamide metabolism through enzyme induction or 
competition. Aprepitant is a substrate, a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and a 
mild/modest inducer of CYP3A4. As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 at a dose of 125 mg/80 mg, 
aprepitant may increase plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered oral medications that 
are metabolized through CYP3A4. Accordingly, the MAH has opened a new signal evaluation for 
drug-drug interaction.  
The post-marketing data and available data suggest a possible drug-drug interaction between 
ifosfamide and aprepitant that may contribute to the observed neurotoxicity. 
Based on the presented data including review of literature, the Drug Interaction Section of the 
product will be revised to include information regarding a possible drug-drug interaction between 
aprepitant and ifosfamide. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Ivemend, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance fosaprepitant is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

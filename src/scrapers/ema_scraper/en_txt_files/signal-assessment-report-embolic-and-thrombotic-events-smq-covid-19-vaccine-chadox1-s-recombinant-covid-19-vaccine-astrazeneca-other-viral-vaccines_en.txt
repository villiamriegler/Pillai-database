1.  Background 
Seriousness: 258 serious cases, 45 fatal. 
Evidence: 269 cases in EudraVigilance for the SMQ ‘Embolic and thrombotic events’ 
ROR: NA 
Exposure: as of 11 March 2021, over 5.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been 
administered in EU/EEA countries [source: ECDC COVID-19 Tracker] [1]; in the UK, exposure was 
approximately 9.7 million doses as of 28 February 2021 [source: weekly summary of Yellow Card 
reporting] [2]. 
At the time of the PRAC meeting on 18 March 2021, it was noted that the latest overall exposure in 
EU/EEA and UK combined, as of 14 March 2021, was close to 20 million first doses administered [1]. 
Regulatory context: NA 
COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is an adenovirus vector vaccine which received a conditional marketing 
authorisation in the EU on 29 January 2021 for active immunisation against COVID-19 in individuals 
18 years of age and older.  
Cases of thromboembolic events have been reported following administration of COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca in several EEA countries, some leading to local suspensions of specific batches or to the 
use of the vaccine itself. An observed-to-expected analysis performed on 8 March 2021 identified no 
increased risk of thromboembolic events following administration of the vaccine although there were 
limitations.  
Venous thromboembolism is an important potential risk included in the RMP of the recently approved 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, another adenovirus vaccine, due to an imbalance in clinical trials. Natural 
infection with SARS-COV-2 has been associated with hypercoagulability, microangiopathy and venous 
or arterial thromboembolic events. One of the mechanisms hypothesised for the hypercoagulable state 
seen in patients with severe COVID-19 is related to the high-grade systemic inflammatory response. 
2.  Initial evidence 
2.1.  Signal validation  
A search performed in EudraVigilance on 11 March 2021 for cases of ‘Embolic and thrombotic events’ 
(SMQ) yielded 269 cases, mostly from the UK (224 cases). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was 
not reported as such in any of the cases. Two additional cases were retrieved under the MedDRA PT 
‘coagulopathy’, both from the UK, but were excluded from the review due to limited information. The 
majority (60%) of cases occurred in female patients. Median age was 70 years. Forty-five (45) cases 
had a fatal outcome. 
Thirty (30) cases originated from the EEA: Germany (6), Sweden (5), Austria (5), Ireland (2), France 
(2), Denmark, Norway, Italy, Finland, Croatia, Latvia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Czech Republic (1 
each).  
Of these, 19 were in women, 11 in male; 8/30 were consumer reports. Time-to-onset ranged from 0 to 
16 days. Thrombotic events were reported in 10 cases, e.g. deep vein thrombosis, hepatic vein 
thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, carotid artery thrombosis, peripheral

artery thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Other reported events included pulmonary 
embolism (8), thrombocytopenia (6), disseminated intravascular coagulation (4), deep vein thrombosis 
(4), hepatic vein thrombosis (2). In 14 cases the vaccinee had risk factors for thromboembolic events 
such as hypertension, thyroiditis, obesity or chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen (14) cases have limited 
information. Seven (7) cases had a fatal outcome, in vaccinees were aged 24 to 60; disseminated 
intravascular coagulation occurred in 3 of them. 
2.2.  Signal confirmation  
In total there were 269 cases of ‘Embolic and thrombotic events’ , median age was 70 years. Thirty 
(30) cases originated from the EEA. Seven (7) cases had a fatal outcome, in vaccinees aged 24 to 60; 
disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in 3 of them. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
was not reported as such in any of the cases. Although an observed-to-expected analysis performed on 
8 March 2021 identified no increased risk of thromboembolic events following administration of the 
vaccine, further investigation is needed as these cases led to local suspensions of specific batches or 
the use of the vaccine itself. Besides, Venous thromboembolism is an important potential risk in the 
RMP of the recently approved COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, another adenovirus vaccine, due to an 
imbalance in clinical trials. 
Therefore the signal is confirmed. 
2.3.  Proposed recommendation 
Following the suspension of a batch (number ABV5300) of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca [3]  and the 
pause of the vaccination campaign with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in Denmark and some other 
Member States [4], the MAH has been requested as part of a late breaking request for the Summary 
Monthly Safety Report (due date 15 March 2021) to provide: 
A cumulative review of reports of Embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ Broad). The review should 
include at a minimum a discussion of fatal and serious events, if any batch clustering is observed with 
focus on ABV5300 batch, other risk factors – if they can be identified, an observed versus expected 
analysis, and risk-benefit considerations. 
3.  Additional evidence  
3.1.  Assessment of additional data  
3.1.1.  Introduction 
The COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca was granted a conditional marketing authorisation by the 
European Commission on 29 January 2021. Over 6.9 million doses have been administered in the 
EU/EEA countries [1] and over 9.7 million doses in the UK [2]. In EU countries, COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca was administrated mainly in adults <60 years, while e.g. Comirnaty has been more 
evenly administered in all age groups and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna more in adults >60 years [5]. 
The following events highlight the ongoing insights regarding the issue of thromboembolic events: 
-  On 7 March 2021, the Austrian National Competent Authority suspended the use of one batch 
of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) as a precautionary measure 
following reports of events of thromboembolic events occurring with use of the vaccine4.

-  On 11 March 2021, the Danish Health Authority paused its vaccination campaign with COVID-
19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. This was decided as a precautionary measure while a full investigation 
is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in 
Denmark where a person died [4]. This has since been followed by suspension in multiple other 
countries, in the EU.  
-  On 13 March 2021, Norway issued a Rapid alert following a cluster of three healthcare 
professional cases reporting apparent immune thrombocytopenia in conjunction with cerebral 
venous sinus thromboses in young individuals (aged between 30-49 ) within 7 to 10 days of 
vaccination.  
-  On 15 of March, the Paul Ehrlich Institute issued a statement on the specifically noting cases of 
cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. They received reports of cases of 
thrombotic events with concomitant thrombocytopenia in six women aged between 20 – 49  
years and one young man aged between 20-29 years who became symptomatic four to 16 
days apart after receiving COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine.  The six women developed central 
sinus vein thrombosis, two of which were fatal. A first Observed versus expected analysis 
concluded that more cases of sinus thrombosis have been reported than would be expected by 
statistical chance . 
On 16 March, a preparatory PRAC meeting was held to discuss the ongoing signal of embolic and 
thrombotic events. 
Based on above evolution and pattern of cases, the focus of the signal shifted from overall 
thromboembolic events to specific entities, specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia and Disseminated intravascular coagulation.  
This assessment is based on  information which was available up to the 17th March 2021, including the 
EMA assessment of EudraVigilance (EV) data and preliminary information provided by the Biologics 
Working Party (BWP).  
The assessment report is structured as follows: 
-  Background on specific clinical entities 
-  Review of Clinical, non-clinical and Quality information 
-  Review of the Embolic and thrombotic events by the MAH, following the current signal request 
- 
EMA evaluation of EV data and expert review 
-  MHRA conclusion 
-  Discussion on possible hypothesis 
-  Conclusions and recommendations 
3.1.2.  Background information on specific clinical entities 
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare manifestation of thrombosis with an incidence 
that varies between studies (Capecchi, 2018) [6]. In adults, the annual incidence of CVST is 2 to 5 
cases per million individuals, but it is likely to be underestimated because of the lack of well-designed 
epidemiological studies. Two recent studies in The Netherlands and southern Australia found a higher 
Signal assessment report on embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) – COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (Other viral 
vaccines)

incidence than previously reported of 13.2 and 15.7 annual cases per million, respectively (Coutinho, 
2012; Devasagayam, 2016) [7, 8]. 
At variance with arterial stroke that is more prevalent in the elderly, CVST typically affects young 
adults with a mean age of 35 years and is more common in women than in men (2.2:1) because of 
sex-specific risk factors (Capecchi, 2018) [6]. 
Because symptoms of CVST are variable and aspecific, diagnosis is often delayed to a median period of 
7 days from the onset of clinical manifestations (Ferro, 2004) [9]. The most common presenting 
symptoms are: headache (88.8%), seizures (39.3%), paresis (37.2%), papilledema (28.3%) and 
mental status changes (22%). 
Risk factors are associated with a multitude of acquired and inherited events, these include other 
central nervous system events such as intracranial neoplasias and infection, procedural events such as 
surgery and lumbar puncture as well as other systemic risk factors for thrombotic events eg: nephrotic 
syndrome, vasculitis, oral contraception and pregnancy (Alvis-Miranda, 2013) [10].  
CVST is more common in women of reproductive age than in men, as a result of the use of oral 
contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy and the puerperium (Bousser, 2012) [11]. 
Oral contraceptive use is by far the most common risk factor, reported in more than 80% of women in 
various series and associated with a pooled estimate of approximately 6-fold increased risk of CVST 
(Dentali, 2006) [12]. In 85% of patients at least one risk factor is identified and 50% of events are 
triggered by the interaction of more risk factors (Capecchi, 2018) [6]. 
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, along with other paradoxical thromboembolic events, have been 
known to rarely occur in other immune thrombocytopenic states such as immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) (Hernandez, 2015; Sarpatwari 2010 [13]) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenic thrombotic 
syndrome (HITT). Plausible mechanisms for the clinical paradox associating immune thrombocytopenia 
particularly with venous thromboembolic events have been postulated, including increased platelet 
microparticle thrombogenicity following peripheral destruction, increased antiphospholipid antibody 
activity and increased levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (Rasheed, 2020) [14]. 
A recent literature review of CVST in COVID-19 identified 9 studies and 14 patients (Tu, 2020) [15]. The 
median age was 43 years and majority had no significant past medical conditions (60.0%). The time taken 
from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST diagnosis was a median of 7 days. 
Type 2 HITT is the more serious of the two types of HITT. It is a rare condition occurring in 
approximately 1- 3% of patients receiving heparin (Arepally, 2017) [16]. Events manifest secondary to 
an immunological response leading to thrombocytopenia, bleeding and thrombosis. The time to onset 
is typically 4-10 days following heparin therapy. Clinical events occur secondary to an immune 
response to PF4/heparin, although the immune response is recognised to occur more frequently than 
clinical manifestations of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis (Arepally, 2017) [16]. Patients can 
experience thrombocytopenia concurrent with thrombosis, with thrombosis being the more severe 
complication and can be life-threatening (Arepally, 2017) [16]. Thrombotic events primarily affect the 
venous system, although arterial involvement can also occur (Majeed, 2010) [17]. 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presents with thrombocytopenia along with 
microvascular thrombosis and haemolytic anaemia with characteristic red cell fragments on peripheral 
smear (Louw, 2018) [18]. Secondary forms can result from extrinsic triggers including autoimmune 
disorders, pregnancy and viral infection. This arises from antibodies to ADAMTS13, a protease that 
cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers into smaller ones. This protease's deficiency leads to 
VWF giant multimers that bind to platelets, and coagulation factors promote the coagulation cascade.

Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis have also been associated with COVID-19 disease. The 
incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has been variable across studies. Mild 
thrombocytopenia has been observed in up to one-third of these patients, with even higher rate in 
patients with severe disease (57.7%) compared with non-severe disease (31.6%). ITP has also been 
known to occur with onset occurring in 20% of cases 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, with 
reports occurring after clinical recovery (Bhattacharjee, 2020) [19]. Cases of TTP have also been 
reported to occur (Bhattacharjee, 2020) [19]. The proposed mechanisms of thrombocytopenia with 
COVID-19 involve inhibition of platelet synthesis due to direct infection of the bone marrow cells or 
platelets by the virus (possibly via CD-13 receptors) and dysfunctional marrow microenvironment; 
virus-mediated liver damage leading to decreased thrombopoietin production; pulmonary endothelial 
damage followed by platelet aggregation in the lungs, subsequent formation of microthrombi, and 
platelet consumption; and finally, the destruction of platelets by the immune system. 
3.1.3.  Clinical and non clinical (CHMP) and Quality (input from BWP)  
A summary is presented below of non-clinical and clinical data assessed within the marketing 
authorisation application and related to thromboembolic events .  
-  Clinical data were reviewed from clinical trials assessed as part of the marketing authorisation 
(MA) application and additional data submitted after the MA, including data currently under 
evaluation . These data did not suggest an association of thrombotic events with the use of the 
AZ1222 vaccine.  
- 
There were no adverse events of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia reported for 
the AZD1222 group. A slightly higher frequency of platelet decrease was observed post second 
dose of the AZD1222 vaccine [3.1%] than post first dose [1.8%], however this was also true in 
the control group [0.6% and 1.1% respectively]. All clinical laboratory results in the AZD1222 
group were within normal clinical range and were not considered Adverse Events. 
-  Available data from studies with other ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine candidates demonstrated the 
vector is well tolerated at all dose levels investigated, with no SAEs related to the vaccine 
reported. Local and systemic AEs were predominantly self-limiting and shortlived. 
-  Non-clinical data of AZ1222 show strong immunogenicity response following two dose 
administration in animals. In addition, available data show a favourable safety profile. Adverse 
effects are limited to the site of administration and all findings reported were reversible by the 
end of the recovery period. 
-  Regarding inflammatory response after vaccination, it was concluded that the only relevant 
signs observed following immunisation in primary pharmacology studies in animal models are 
restricted to respiratory tract tissues following challenge and no apparent signs of inflammation 
are observed as a result of immunisation. 
Quality aspects were discussed at the BWP on 16 March 2021. It was concluded that there is no 
indication thus far that SAE are linked to quality of the vaccine. As a further follow-up, the MAH was 
requested to provide a full batch analysis for specific lots and batch data from UK supplied lots, to 
understand if there are any clear differences between that and the EU product.  
PRAC  Assessment  
Based on the input provided by the CHMP Rapporteur on the clinical and non-clinical data (DLP 7 Dec 
2020), there was no evidence to suggest an association of thrombotic events with the use of the 
Signal assessment report on embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) – COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (Other viral 
vaccines)

AZ1222 vaccine. A slightly higher frequency of platelet decrease was observed post second dose of 
the AZD1222 vaccine compared to post first dose, however this was also true in the control group. All 
clinical laboratory results in the AZD1222 group were within normal clinical range and were not 
considered as Adverse Events. 
Moreover, the BWP concluded that there is no indication so far that SAE are linked to the quality of 
the vaccine (16 March 2021). Follow-up questions for specific batches were asked to the MAH. 
3.1.4.  MAH report 
3.1.4.1.  AstraZeneca response: 
A search of the company’s safety database was undertaken on 08 March 2021 for cumulative adverse 
event data (up to 08 March 2021) from spontaneous and solicited reporting sources using PTs under 
SMQ Embolic and thrombotic events (MedDRA version 23.1) in association with the use of post-
marketing use of COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA. 
The search identified 267 cases involving 286 events (PTs) from post marketing sources. 279 events 
(PTs) were serious and 7 were non-serious. After the search was carried out, two additional cases of 
pulmonary embolism were identified, as of 10 March 2021. These 2 cases with 2 events (MedDRA 
Preferred Term [PT]) have been added to the analysis of pulmonary embolism. An additional case with 
PT Pulmonary Embolism was also  included in the below analysis. The 288 events are listed Table 1

* After the listings were run, follow-up information was received on 10 March 2021 . Based on the 
follow-up information the initially reported PT of Deep vein thrombosis was no longer valid and 
removed. The case report remains included in the analysis, although no longer qualifying for the scope 
of the search. There was a duplicate case in the safety database .This case is not included in the 
analysis. 
The reports were received from United Kingdom (246), India (8), Austria (3), France (2), Germany (2), 
Poland (2), Bangladesh (1), Finland (1), Ireland (1), Latvia (1), Norway (1) and Sweden (1). The 269 
cases described 166 females, 95 male and in 8 reports gender was not identified. 
Two cases were from non-interventional/post-marketing sources and 267 were spontaneously 
reported.  
Out of the 269 cases, 102 were medically confirmed. 40 events had a fatal outcome.

The case level outcomes were: Not Recovered (75), Recovered (44), Recovering (73), Recovered with 
Sequelae (13) Unknown (24) and Fatal (40). Follow-up information was received on 10 March 2021 for 
one case. Based on the follow-up information the initially reported PT of Deep vein thrombosis was no 
longer valid and this case should not have been part of this analysis. The case report remains included 
in the demographic and other information details, although no longer qualifying for the scope of the 
search. 
PRAC  Assessment  
The search in the AstraZeneca global safety database (DLP 8 March 2021) using the SMQ Embolic and 
thrombotic events identified 269 cases, with 288 PTs. In decreasing order, these PTs were 
Cerebrovascular accident (n=57), Myocardial infarction (n=34), Pulmonary embolism (n=22), 
Monoplegia (n=31), Deep vein thrombosis (n=15), Ischemic stroke (n=11), [..], Cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis (n=4),[ …] DIC (n=1) […]. These cases originated mainly from the UK (91%) with 
female predominance (64%). 
The estimated number of doses administered according the 2nd MSSR was 1,903,293 doses for the EU 
and 9,589,941 doses in the UK (DLP 28 February 2021). 
3.1.4.2.  Fatal case reports 
There were 39 fatal cases occurring in 25 females and 14 males, aged 32-97 years (mean 71 years). 
Age was not reported in 2 cases. The cases originated from the United Kingdom (32), India (6), and 
Austria (1). Of the 39 cases, 26 were medically confirmed. 
There were 18 fatal cases with a cause of death of Myocardial infarction (MI). Of the 18 cases, 10 
occurred in vaccinees aged 70 years and older. A summary of the remaining 8 cases  aged less than 
70-yeasr old is provided below:  
•  A total of 8 patients (7 males and 1 female), experienced an event of myocardial infarction 
with fatal outcome.  Three reports were from the UK and 5 were reported from India. It was 
noted in each of the 5 reports of MI from India government officials, that the deaths were not 
related to the vaccine. 
• 
The patients ranged in age from 42-67 years, with a mean age of 53 years. For 7 cases where 
the time to onset was reported, the range was from 1 to 9 days. The cause of death was 
reported as: MI or Heart attack in 7 reports, and Cardiogenic shock with myocardial infarction 
in 1 report. 
• 
Five (5) of these 8 patients had a medical history of cardiac disease, aortic stenosis due for 
upcoming surgery, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, all of which were likely to 
have contributed to the fatal events of myocardial infarction. The remaining 3 reports lacked 
sufficient information such as medical history concerning cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
renal function, smoking, and obesity, to be able to assess a causal relationship.  
There were 8 fatal cases of Cerebrovascular accident all occurring in vaccines aged 79 years and 
older. 
All other fatal events (8 events) were singular or were reported at two occurrences (Table 2) apart 
from 5 fatal cases of Pulmonary embolism/infarction that are described below.

PRAC Assessment  
Review of the fatal case reports (n=39) indicated that the majority originated from the UK (n=32). 
There were 6 cases from India and 1 from Austria. Main cause reported was Myocardial infarction 
(n=18), occurring in > 70 years for 10 cases and in 42-67 years for 8 cases. 
Other causes reported were: Cerebrovascular Accident (n=8),  all in patients > 79y, Pulmonary 
embolism (n=5) with 4 cases from the UK (70-89y) and 1 case from Austria (40-49y). Other PTs in 
remaining cases (8) include cerebral thrombosis (n=2), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (n=1), 
aortic embolism (n=1), haemorraghic stroke (n=1).

3.1.4.3.  Lot Numbers 
Batch numbers were not reported in 139 cases or events. The three batches with the highest number 
of cases are: AB0006 (491,700 doses distributed, 17 SAEs reported), AB0001 (533,100 doses 
distributed, 12 SAEs), PV46662 (700,800 doses distributed, 10 SAEs). There was no cluster of events 
for any of these batches. In addition to the above batches, 2 cases from Austria have been received 
with batch no ABV5300 (1,060,200 doses distributed); no other thrombotic events were reported from 
this batch. 
PRAC Assessment   
The MAH stated that there was no cluster of events for any of the batches. The MAH should clarify in 
the next MSSR how this was concluded.  
3.1.4.4.  Observed versus Expected analyses for Pulmonary Embolism and Deep vein 
thrombosis 
Observed-to-expected (O/E) analyses were performed by the MAH for deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism. Background incidence rates were defined by the number of incident reports of a 
condition or event occurring naturally in the population, expressed in person-time and these 
background estimates were obtained from the literature. The observed number of cases were found to 
be significantly less than the expected number of events, the results of the O/E analysis are presented 
in Table 3. See section 3.2.2 of the Summary Safety Report for more information on process of O/E 
calculation.

PRAC Assessment   
The observed number of cases for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was well below the  
expected number of cases. This results in a rate ratio with a value clearly close to zero and an upper 
bound of the 95% confidence interval well below unity; that is, the results of this analysis show that 
the number of observed cases is statistically significantly lower than expected.  
The findings of the O/E analysis are reassuring. However, O/E analyses are often subject to many 
important sources of uncertainty and the findings should be interpreted cautiously. 
In this particular case, the following information was not provided: 1) there is no presentation of the 
Signal assessment report on embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) – COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (Other viral 
vaccines)

literature search strategy or the results of the search for backgound incidences, 2) there is no 
discussion about the comparability between the source population of observed cases and the 
populations used to derive the background incidences, and there are no stratified analyses (by age, 
gender), 3) there are no sensitivity analyses presented to explore the impact of potential sources of 
uncertainty (e.g., under-reporting, background incidence). With regard to the latter, it should be 
noted that reasonable changes in the parameter values in the uncertainty analysis would probably not 
change the main conclusions, given the large difference between expected and observed figures and 
4) there is no details on the risk period applied. 
In conclusion, the analysis is reassuring but: 1) it should not be used as the only source of 
information for decision-making, 2) on the basis of the document, it is of limited value because 
questions remain to be answered in order to better assess the quality of the analysis (sources for 
incidence rates, lack of sensitivity analyses, lack of stratified analyses, assessment of the 
comparability of the source populations of the observed cases and for the calculation of incidence 
rates). The MAH is requested to provide a more detailed section to address these issues in the next 
MSSR.  
3.1.4.5.  Pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction 
There were 22 cases of Pulmonary embolism, one of which also included Pulmonary infarction. 
The cases originated in the United Kingdom (18), France (1) and Austria (3). 
All three cases from Austria were reported in females. 
Two cases from Austria were reported from the lot ABV5300 and one from the lot ABV3025.  
All 22 cases were spontaneously reported and were serious. Five reports had fatal outcome and 14 of 
the 22 cases were medically confirmed.  
Outcomes of the adverse events of Pulmonary embolism/Pulmonary infarction were: Recovering (8), 
Recovered with sequelae (2), Not recovered (1), Fatal (5) and Unknown (6). 
The demographics and time to onset of the vaccinees are presented in Table 4:

3.1.4.5.1.  Fatal Pulmonary Embolism 
There are 5 cases with fatal outcome. These are described below.  
-  A 79+ year-old female patient of unknown ethnic origin  with unknown past medical history 
and concomitant medication of calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol for osteopenia received 
COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (batch number AB0007). On day 1, she collapsed while 
walking and was admitted to hospital. She was diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation, bilateral

pulmonary embolisms, acute congestive cardiac failure, and was intubated. On day 2, the 
patient experienced multiple organ failure, mitral incompetence and pneumothorax. On day 2, 
the patient died. It is not known whether an autopsy was performed. Patient had not shown 
symptoms associated with COVID-19.  
-  A 79+year-old female patient of unknown ethnic origin  with past and current medical history 
of dementia and unknown concomitant medications received COVID-19 VACCINE 
ASTRAZENECA (batch number AB0001). On an unknown date, the patient experienced 
pulmonary infarction, deep vein thrombosis leg and pulmonary embolism. On day 5, the 
patient died from pulmonary infarction. An autopsy was performed which showed the cause of 
death was 1. Pulmonary infarction, 2. Left leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 3. Ischaemic 
heart disease. The reporter concluded that the DVT may have occurred after a fall prior to 
receipt of her COVID vaccine.  
-  A 70-79-year-old female patient of unknown ethnic origin  with past and current medical 
history of stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension and hypothyroidism and 
unknown concomitant products received COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (batch number 
AB0006). On day 3 post-vaccination, the patient experienced unilateral leg pain, leg swelling 
and deep vein thrombosis. On day 4, the patient experienced pulmonary embolism, 
hypotension, and hypoxia. On an unknown day, the patient died from the event of pulmonary 
embolism. An autopsy was not performed. The cause of death was pulmonary embolism. The 
history of stroke and the concomitant type 2 diabetes suggests that the patient was at risk of 
thrombotic events. 
-  A 70-79-year-old female vaccinee received COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (batch number 
unknown) and 4 days later experienced pulmonary embolism and malaise. The vaccinee died 
on the same day, cause of death was reported as pulmonary embolus. No other information 
was available.  
-  A 40-49-year-old female with a family history of fatal pulmonary embolism in immediate family 
received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300). The patient experienced 
splenic vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary embolism, 
portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis. On an unknown date, the patient 
experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient experienced asystole and died 10 days later. 
Cause of death was reported as pulmonary embolism, splenic vein thrombosis, portal vein 
thrombosis, asystole, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic vein thrombosis and vein thrombosis 
mesenteric. It was not known whether an autopsy was performed.  
3.1.4.5.2.  Non-Fatal Pulmonary Embolism 
There are 13 cases reported with very limited medical information to evaluate/assess the case for 
relatedness/association. 
One case was related to a potential vaccination error and there was no information on pulmonary 
embolism from the narrative. It is not clear based on the available information if this a case of 
pulmonary embolism. 
Three cases had confounding medical history: 
•  Case one has a past history of pulmonary embolism and was treated with Rivaroxaban but had 
missed a dose on the day of the event.

vaccines)

Page 15/50 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Case two has a past history of unknown neoplasm which could have contributed to the 
pulmonary embolism.   
•  Case three experienced pulmonary embolism on the same day as receiving the vaccine; the 
case was confounded as the vaccinee had suspected COVID-19.  
3.1.4.6.  Summary 
In summary, a review of the cases of pulmonary embolism indicated no pattern of events and no 
clustering of risk factors were identified. Further, there were no trends seen for any batches that were 
included in this analyses. 
The observed number of cases is significantly less than the expected number of events. Past history of 
pulmonary embolism, neoplasm, current history of deep vein thrombosis and missed dose of anti-
coagulant were noted as risk factors for pulmonary embolism in cases where this information was 
available. 
3.1.4.7.  Deep vein thrombosis 
There were 15 cases of Deep vein thrombosis occurring in 11 females and 4 males. All cases were from 
the United Kingdom. All cases were spontaneous, and serious and 7 were medically confirmed. 
Outcomes of the adverse events of Deep vein thrombosis were: recovering (6), recovered with 
sequelae (1), not recovered (3), died (1) and unknown (4). 
Lot/Batch numbers were available in 9 case reports, 1 report each from AB0001, AB0002, AB0005, 
AB0008, AB0011, AB0012, PV46662, and 2 reports from AB0006.

Follow-up information was received on 10 March 2021 for one Case  (incorrectly considered to be a 
fatal DVT case). Based on the follow-up information this case did not involve a DVT. This case is 
nevertheless included in this analysis. In 2 cases, DVT was reported together with Pulmonary embolism 
and these cases were fatal and discussed above in Section 3.1.4.5.1.   
In 4 cases the vaccinee had confounding medical history:  
•  Case :  history of DVT 
•  Case :  concurrent COVID-19 illness  
•  Case :  history of testicular cancer with metastasis to liver  
•  Case :  history of clotting disorder 
In one of the 15 cases, there was a non-fatal case received which included a PT of DVT. However, 
reported verbatim was reported as “Suffered Nausea”. No other details were provided in the narrative 
about DVT.

In the remaining 7 cases, available information was too limited to assess.  
3.1.4.8.  Summary 
In summary, there was no trend seen after reviewing the cases of DVT. There were no cases of DVT 
associated with lot number ABV5300. There were no trends seen for any batches that were included in 
this analyses. The observed number of DVT cases is significantly less than the expected number of 
events. 
Overall conclusion 
Based on the data available from post-marketing experience, it is AstraZeneca’s opinion that the 
information in the current document and the AstraZeneca Core Data Sheet continues to accurately 
reflect the known benefit-risks for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.  
PRAC Assessment  
The MAH revised cases of Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. It is agreed that based on 
these cases, no specific pattern or clustering of risk factors could be identified.  
However, based on the evolution of events, input from MS and analysis from EMA, the scope of the 
concerns should be directed to specific issues including Disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
haemorrhagic stroke, Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (see 
Global discussion and conclusion).  
3.1.5.  EMA analysis of EudraVigilance data 
3.1.5.1.  Observed to expected analysis 
Based on data available in EudraVigilance up until 12 March 2021. 
EMA provided an assessment of the signal of embolic and thrombotic events for COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca, including an observed to expected analysis (DL 12 March 2021). 
PRAC Assessment   
An exploratory analysis for thromboembolic events was conducted based on EV data. There was a 
lower proportion of overall serious thromboembolic events for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 
compared to the other COVID-19 vaccines. However, a higher fatality rate was noted.   
The observed vs expected analysis for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca for events including DIC, 
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and Haemorrhagic stroke showed a disproportionality in younger 
age groups, specifically those aged 18-54 years. However several limitations for this type of analysis 
apply, and should be taken into account, as discussed in the report, including: 
(i)  Code lists used to identify expected cases may not match the MedDRA classification used to 
identify observed cases in EV; 
(ii)  Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis from published article identified by review of 
medical records in 2008-2010; uncertainty on comparability of diagnostic criteria with 
Signal assessment report on embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19

vaccines)

2021 cases; 
(iii) Background incidence rates are from one database/country only; 
(iv) There might be under-reporting when the observed number of cases is calculated from 
spontaneous reporting systems such as EV; 
(v)  There might be delay in reporting: during a mass vaccination some case reports might not 
have been submitted yet to EV; 
(vi) There might be more intensive case ascertainment in vaccinated individuals. 
It also has to be considered that the populations exposed to the different COVID-19 vaccines can vary 
overall and between Member States, for example in terms of age, gender and prevalence of relevant 
co-morbidities.   
In conclusion, for overall thromboembolic events this analysis is reassuring. However, a signal of 
disproportionality was noted for rare events, such as DIC, Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 
Haemorrhagic stroke warranting further investigation. 
Updated OE analyses performed with data (DLP including data available in Eudravigilance up 
to the 16th March 2021 at 6pm) 
EMA performed an updated observed to expected analysis (DLP including data available in 
Eudravigilance up to the 16th March 2021 at 6pm) . 
Data sources used in the OE analysis 
Data provided by the ACCESS consortium, stratified by age group, based on the average of the period 
from 2017-2020 
• 
The databases used for the main analysis for the three events investigated are: 
o  Coagulation disorder (this was used to compare with the SMQ Embolic and 
thrombotic events): ARS from Italy  
o  Disseminated intravascular coagulation: FISABIO from Spain  
o  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: ARS from Italy  
•  Different data sources were chosen according to the event considered, the reason was that 
when several incidence rates estimates existed (also considering other sources and 
literature), the data source with the median rate was chosen. 
In addition a conservative sensitivity analysis was performed using the database with the lower 
incidence rate estimate

simplified way (<60 and 60 years and above) or do not provide details. When detailed data by age 
group was not available, information from countries where this information was provided was used to 
impute a distribution. 
3.1.5.2.  Specific Case assessement 
Review of data received in EudraVigilance up to 12 March 2021 
EMA conducted a search in the Eudravigilance database with a data lock point on 12 March 2021. The 
search terms were SMQ ‘Embolic and trhombotic events’, PT ‘coagulopathy’.  
General results (Data lock point 12/03/2021) 
A total of 293 case reports were retrieved. After exclusion of possible duplicates, non-serious cases 
and consumer reports, 202 serious cases from healthcare professionals were selected for further 
review. 
Most of the 202 cases originate from outside the EEA, with UK accounting for the highest number 
(158); of note, 5 cases from India. The 37 EEA cases (18%) originate from Austria, Germany (8 each),

France (4), Sweden (3), Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, Korea and Spain (1 each).  
The majority of cases (122) are in female patients, 76 are in men and in 4 cases the gender is not 
reported. Age ranges from 16 to 99 years with a median of 47.  
25 different batch numbers were reported in 106 cases with this information. The batch number most 
frequently reported was mentioned 14 times.  
The 10 most frequently reported thromboembolic terms were cerebrovascular accident (49), 
myocardial infarction (30), pulmonary embolism (24), monoplegia (16), ischaemic stroke (15), 
transient ischemic attack (15), deep venous thrombosis (13), hemiparesis (12), monoparesis (9), and 
acute myocardial infarction (6). 
In 45 cases (22%), the outcome was fatal.  
Time-to-onset for the thromboembolic events was specified in 181 cases, ranging from 0 to 34 days.  
In 44 cases, the TE events were preceded by flu-like symptoms. Thrombocytopenia was reported in 7 
cases. In 120 cases, there were underlying risk factors for the reported events such as a history of 
hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, cardiac disorders, pulmonary embolism or 
comedications such as oral contraceptives. In a further 9 cases, there was a history of confirmed or 
suspected COVID-19. In 55 cases there was insufficient information for causality assessment. In 18 
cases, there were no clear alternative explanation for the events. Of note, a history of autoimmune 
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or thyroiditis was reported in 29 cases. 
Among the trombotic events of special interest: a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was 
reported 5 times, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was reported 4 times, and superior 
sagittal sinus thrombosis was reported once. (DLP 12/03) 
Updated review including data available in Eudravigilance up to the 16th March 2021 at 6pm  
A search in EudraVigilance for cases of ‘embolic and thrombotic events’ (SMQ) for the high level active  
substances COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA CHADOX1 NCOV-19 and COVID 19 VACCINE 
(CHADOX1 S[RECOMBINANT]) was performed. The results included reports sent to EV up to 16 March 
2021 18:00 CET. 
A total of 469 reports was retrieved, which may include duplicates. Of these , 436 (93%) were serious, 
including 59 fatal (13%). One-hundred and ninety-one (191) reports originated from the EEA (41%) 
and 276 from the UK (59%). The majority of reports (312 [67%]) were from healthcare professionals. 
Reports were predominantly in female vaccinees (295 [63%]) with a median age of 60 years. 
Thrombocytopenia (and related PTs) was co-reported as a reaction in 26 cases. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation was reported in the 6 of the retrieved cases, and a follow-up version of one 
of the previously submitted cases was being processed at the time the query was performed, thus 
there were 7 cases in DIC in total. There were 18 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis including 
some reported as ‘cerebral venous thrombosis’ or ‘cerebral thrombosis’. There were also 4 cases of 
mesenteric vein thrombosis.

PRAC Assessment  
Seven cases1 reported with the PT “Disseminated Intravscular Coagulation” (DIC) were identified from 
the Eudravigilance report. Three were less documented.  
The Disseminated Intravascular coagulation (DIC) events were identified mainly in women (6/7) and in 
young adults (aged 26 to 60 years). COViD-19 results were provided for two cases only and both test 
were negative (one of the case had 1 PCR positive on 4 and was considered as false positive)  No 
information was found for the other cases. A fatal outcome was reported in four cases. In five cases, 
severe thrombocytopenia was reported.  
An initial reaction to the vaccine is reported in four cases with no specific pattern. Those immediate 
reactions are followed by a period of improvement, most patients continuing their activities, before 
rapid deterioration 5 to 10 days after vaccination.  
No risks factors for DIC can be clearly identified from this overview of cases. Clearly, the occurrence of 
neurological signs from 4 days after vaccination should alarm and request further imedical 
investigation. However, in the early phase of clinical deterioration, signs and symptoms can be difficult 
to interpret.  
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)/Cerbral venous thrombosis (CVT) (DLP including 
data available in EVDAS up to 6pm on the 16th March 2021) 
A total of 16 cases, reported under the MedDRA PTs ‘cerebral venous thrombosis’ or ‘cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis’ were available in Eudravigilance up to the 16th March 2021 at 6pm. A further two 
cases, reported as ‘cerebral thrombosis’ were considered relevant following review by haematologist 
(expert opinion).  
Of the 18 cases, six were fatal. In one of these fatal cases, an event of disseminated intravascular 
coagulation was also co-reported. Therefore, a total of 9 fatal cases were reported for events of 
DIC/CVST. 
Cases originated from 5 countries: DE (7), IT (3), UK (3), IN (2), NO (2), ES (1). The majority (16) 
were in women, the median age was 42 (range: 22 to 64). The time-to-onset ranged from 1 to 14 
days with a median of 8 days. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 12 cases (67%). Several cases possibly 
confounded by medical history and/or co-medications. 
An overview of the 18 cases of CVT/CVST are presented in the table 7 below

Of the 27 cases of interest, 16 concerned female patients, 8 concerned male patients and in 3 cases 
gender was not specified. Their age ranged from 21 to 80 years, with 3 persons in their twenties, 8 in 
their thirties, 3 in their Fourties, 6 in their Fifties, 3 in their Sixties and one in their Eighties.

Among the 27 cases, 18 were not considered by the experts to be related to the central nervous 
system (CNS). Those includes cases of Venous thromboembolism (5), pulmonary embolism (7), deep 
vein thrombosis (2), portal vein thrombosis (1), splenic infaction (1), vena cava thrombosis (1), local 
site reaction (1), anxiety reaction (4). Most case of pulmonary embolism were associated with venous 
thromboembolism. DIC was identified as possible in two cases. Of note that patients could experience 
various of those terms and that the level of certainty of the diagnosis were variable.  
Among CNS-related events, other causes were identified: in one patient, vascular condition (e.g. 
aneurysm) or effect of another drug (apixaban) could not be excluded, reaction at the injection site 
(1), a pseudo-relapse of multiple sclerosis due to fever, and one case not interpretable.  
The PRAC selected five cases from this previous list. Two of those cases report stroke episodes (in 
yellow in the following table), two report CVST (in orange), and on haemorragic case (blue). For one of 
the latter, an haematologist expert suggested the possibility of Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
(HIT).

Cardiologist: Chills, fever, pain in limb, 
dizziness, headache, vomiting, gait 
instability, hemiparesis, seizure. – 
clinical picture could be of CVST 
(cerebral venous sinus thrombosis). 
Haematologist: Thrombocytopenia in the 
context of DIC 
Neurologist: Personally, the most 
probable situation is a Haemorrhagic 
lobal stroke treated with craniectomy.  
There were also systemic symptoms so 
the CNS haemorrhagic may be in a 
broader context.  
Haematologist: In my opinion, the only 
case that could fit into the clinical 
presentation of TTP (although DIC is 
also likely) 
Neurologist: Ischemic Stroke of 
unknown etiology in a young person 
without vascular risk factors and normal 
cardiac study (except for the finding of 
FOP but nothing supports the embolic 
etiology, so it is probably not related 
with the current stroke)  
Cardiologist: Clinical picture of possible 
TIA event in young patient with PFO. 
PFO is a risk factor for stroke or TIA 
within 24 hours after administration of 
vaccine.  
Cardiologist: Clinical picture of rapidly 
developing thrombocytopenia of 
unknown trigger associated with CVST, 
brain stem infarction and intracranial 
haemorrhage in patient 9 days after 
administration of vaccine.  
Limited blood tests provided do not 
point to DIC (normal clotting time), do 
not point towards TTP (no red cell 
fragments). 
Unclear how the signs of inflammation 
the day after vaccination are linked to 
neurological picture that developed 
thereafter.  
The predominant etiologies of CVST in 
male patients are haematological 
disorders, a hypercoagulable state, 
trauma, cancer. 
Haematologist: intriguing because it fits 
very well with the “HIT-like theory”. This 
patient had an inflammatory syndrome 
(aches, fever) followed by 
thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, but 
without any signs of DIC (normal 
clotting factors) or TTP, and ended up 
having bleeding, probably due to severe 
thrombocytopenia. Strong suspicion of 
HIT like reaction.  
Neurologist: Ischemic stroke 
The appearance of two events in 
different locations (CNS + Femoral) 
suggest that even atrial dilation was 
considered as mild by the Cardiologist, 
the origin may be embolic.  
Cardiologist: Clinical picture of possible 
AF with resulting emboli to CNS and leg 
(increased size of the atrium in 
echocardiography in patients with HTN, 
CHF [nebivolol] and 
hypercholesterolaemia).  
Haematologist: Agree, but also

PRAC Assessment  
From the list of other cases selected in Eudravigilance report, 9 were identified as CNS-related. The 
PRAC selected five of those cases for further review, i.e. two cases of thrombosis, two cases of CVST 
and one case of cerebral haemorrhage. A possibility of DIC was mentioned for two of those patients, one 
with stroke and one with haemorrhage.  
Those cases highlight the need for further research into occurrence of CVST and DIC in Eudravigilance.  
Cases not reported in Eudravigilance at the time of the report 
In addition to the cases identified in Eudravigilance, additional cases were communicated to the PRAC

Thrombocytopenia was reported in 7 cases of the eight cases. No result for COVID-19 testing is 
reported.   
Those cases follow the same chronological pattern of events, with first reactions in the 2 or 3 days 
following vaccination and secondary degradation in the 6 to 14 days following vaccination.    
Those cases are not sufficiently documented to identify potential risk factors beside the fact that all 
cases are women.   
In the other cases communicated, we note one case of deep vein thrombosis, one case of portal vein 
thrombosis, one fatal case of cranial haemorrhage, and  one case of pulmonary embolism. 
The cases identified after the data lock point of the Eudravigilance search were reported ad hoc by 
member states because considered as potentially relevant to the assessment. Their identification does 
not result from a systematic search.  
Review of the cases: Overall PRAC comment  
The Eudravigilance search permitted to identify 202 serious cases from which 22 % were fatal. Most 
cases (122) were female.  
In this report, the PRAC reviewed more specifically the cases of disseminated intravacular coagulation 
(DIC) and cerebral venous Sinus thrombosis (CVST). Several observations were made and should be 
further discussed.  
1)  A chronological pattern is observed, with a first reaction to the vaccine observed in the first 
days after vaccination. This episode usually last 2 or 3 days and is followed, often after a 
healthy interval, by a period of deterioration 6 to about 12 days after vaccination. The clinical 
evolution is rapid.    
2)  A high proportion of cases are female. This may be due to a higher proportion of women 
vaccinated or a higher risk of thrombotic events in this population;

vaccines)

Page 31/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3)  The persons affected are mainly young adults, with some cases in their twenties. Again, this 
could reflect the population currently vaccinated in many countries although many adverse 
events in older population are reported from UK. The identification of more cases in the 
younger population could reflect a higher risk in this population. Eventually, it could also 
reflects the fact that thrombotic events being less expected in this population, those cases 
attract more attention.  
4)  Thrombocytopenia is documented in most cases of thrombotic events. Thrombocytopenia is 
often severe and most likely peripheral. The association of cerebral thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia is unusual and the pathophysiological mechanism of these thromboses may 
differ from classical ischemic strokes.  
The review of the cases did not permit to clearly identify risk factors beside those already mentioned 
(i.e. potentially age and sex). It was also not possible to identify prodromes. High reactogenicity is 
documented for this vaccine and signs and symptoms reported here are not specific. Also, the first 
signs at the time of the degradation varied, although neurological signs and a resurgence or 
increase of symptoms a few days after vaccination should be taken in high consideration.  
Finally, those cases did not permit to document a possible association with COVID-19 infection. 
However, when the results of the tests were made available, they were negative. 
3.1.6.  Information received from MHRA  
Information received on 16th March 
Following the reports of temporarly pause of the vaccination programme with COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca in several EU member states the MHRA conducted a review, focusing on specific UK data 
on venous thromboembolic events occurring more generally along with an evaluation of cases of 
thrombocytopenia, with and without venous thromboembolic events.  
The report mentions the following: 
With AstraZeneca the pattern seen with venous thromboembolic events more generally is in keeping 
with expected background trends and usage of the vaccine. There have been a small number of cases 
reported of thromboses with thrombocytopenia which appear to be in keeping with the cases reported 
from the EU, however this remains at a low incidence given the usage to date. The available evidence 
is insufficient to establish a causal association, and MHRA continues to monitor cases reporting 
thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia and associated events. 
In summary, venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs naturally, in all ages, and is not uncommon. We 
have been closely reviewing reports of VTE and their consequences following vaccination with COVID 
19 vaccines. Amongst the more than 24 million doses of both vaccines administered so far, several 
hundred cases of VTE are expected to have occurred by chance within a short time after vaccination. 
The analyses show no evidence that VTE, overall, is occurring more than what would be expected in 
the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine. 
The action taken by some EU countries over the past week to temporarily pause the use of the 
AstraZeneca vaccine has been based mainly on isolated reports of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis 
concurrent with thrombocytopenia and bleeding shortly after vaccination. This form of blood clot can 
also occur naturally in the absence of vaccination, can occur in association with COVID disease and is 
extremely rare, and a causal association with the vaccine has not been established. The reporting rate 
of this following vaccination in Germany has been 4 per million doses of the vaccine. In the UK, 4

Page 32/50 
 
 
 
 
possible cases of this form of blood clot with low platelets after 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca 
vaccine have been identified so far. 
Whilst this requires further review, a causal association with the vaccine cannot be established based 
on available information. Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these events, the benefits of 
the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, with the latest data suggesting an 85% reduction in hospitalisation 
and death from COVID disease, far outweigh any possible risks of the vaccine. 
3.1.7.  Hypotheses and Comments from Member States 
3.1.7.1.  Background COVID 19 disease and thrombothic disease  
Coagulation abnormalities (including thrombocytopenia) have been associated with COVID-19 disease, 
with variable incidence.  
EMA report on Coagulation abnormalities in context of COVID-19 2021-03-12 (last 
update) Information overview v1.2 
The EMA has released an analysis report on the COVID 19 coagulation abnormalities based on current 
status of knowledge in the information available in the literature  and case studies. 
Relevant sections of this report are summarized below. 
Mechanistic and pathophysiological aspects 
As regard mechanistic and pathophysiological aspects, coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 are 
described as a consequence of both, cell and tissue damage that results from invasion of SARS-CoV-2 
(in particular into type II pneumocytes with their ACE2 expression) with local inflammatory responses 
(endotheliitis), and also general changes such as associated with systemic inflammation, critical illness 
and reduced mobility (stasis). Some have referred to this as "viral coagulopathy", which in COVID-19 
is notable for the high frequency and severity of microthrombosis, in addition to macro-
thromboembolic events (such as also occurring in sepsis).  
It seems to be held that microthromboses can lead to macrothrombosis and subsequently to clinical 
events (e.g., as in review by Ortega‐Paz Luis et al. 2021; Manolis et al. 2021), in both the venous and 
arterial circulation.  
The local mediator and link between inflammation, coagulation abnormalities and microthrombosis is 
reported to be neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in a process dubbed NETosis (reports predate 
COVID-19). This mediation occurs at both levels, local (microvascular) and systemic (macrovascular), 
for reasons including that NETs can enter vessels and cause platelet activation (through Toll-like 
receptors, TLR), factor V activation and thrombin generation. NETs are large extracellular, web-like 
structures of former cytosolic and granule proteins that assemble on a scaffold of chromatin, and these 
have been described to kill extracellular pathogens (Lee and Grinstein 2004).  
These pathophysiological events can occur in the absence of an obvious systemic cytokine storm.  
The coagulation abnormalities can lead to comorbidities and events such as VTE, stroke, diabetes, 
lung, heart attack, acute kidney injury and liver injury. Conversely, cardiovascular risk factors can 
exacerbate the dysfunction of endothelium cells and platelet and contribute to coagulopathy.

vaccines)

Consistent laboratory findings of coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 are: elevated factor VIII and 
elevated fibrinogen.  Unusual findings are: bleeding, thrombocytopenia, "very long" (a)PTT (e.g., more 
than 6 s longer than normal [25-35 s] and / or aPTT is out-of-proportion longer than PT is longer). D-
dimers are recommended to be measured (see below) and to be better reported to avoid 
misinterpretation (Favaloro and Thachil 2020). 
Risk factors 
In COVID-19 hospitalised patients, the "D-dimer level at presentation was independently associated 
with thrombotic events, consistent with an early coagulopathy", based on more than 3300 consecutive 
admissions in New York state (Bilaloglu et al. 2020). Baseline D-dimer levels seem useful for 
stratification of investigational interventions (such as done in the REMAP-CAP trial), but at this time 
they have no systematic impact on clinical management.  
Of note are estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for a thrombotic event (ibidem, table 2): male 1.5, 
myocardial infarct 1.4, congestive heart failure 1.3 and D-dimer from 1.2 to 7, whereas HRs for age 
and BMI were around unity. (Reasons for the prognostic importance of sex can be addressed in an 
update of this document.) A systematic review quantified risk factors for VTEs in around 30,000 
COVID-19 patients (table 4 in Nopp et al. 2020), reporting that men at higher risk to develop VTE but 
finding no association between comorbidities or age with the risk of VTE, possibly because the high 
VTE risk associated with COVID-19 masks general VTE risk factors such as age.  
Strong clinical risk factors for VTEs in the general population are high age, obesity, reduced mobility, 
history of cancer or active cancer, intensive care treatment, history of VTE or thrombophilia; inherited 
thrombophilia conditions may or may not be known at the time of a TE, but they concern up to 12% of 
the general population (considering for example factor V Leiden; further such conditions are 
prothrombin mutations, deficiency of AT or protein S or C, anti-phospholipid syndrome).  
The ISTH scoring system is an important tool to synthesise risk factors in patients with conditions that 
predispose to disseminated intravascular coagulation (Levi et al. 2009), which in some patients 
predominates as thrombosis, arterial or venous thromboembolism, purpura fulminans associated with 
peripheral ischemia or vascular skin infarction. In the case of a predisposing condition, the score 
ranges from 3 (minimum) to 8 points (maximum):  
• 
• 
• 
Platelet count: 1 point if 50,000 to 100,000/µl, 2 points if <50,000/µl 
PT: 1 point if 3 to 6 s, 2 points if more than 6 s prolonged  
Fibrinogen: 1 point if <100 mg/dL 
•  D-dimer: 2 points for moderate, 3 points for "strong" increase [cut-off values have not been 
defined but "3- to 4-fold increases" are proposed (Thachil et al. 2020)] 
COVID-19 as a severe infection should qualify as predisposing condition so that the score can be used 
to gauge the risks of patient for coagulation-related events. With respect to coagulopathy, it has been 
recommended to monitor PT, D‐dimers, platelet counts and fibrinogen for determining the prognosis of 
Covid‐19 patients (Thachil et al. 2020). 
Other risk factors for coagulation abnormalities and / or TEs in COVID-19 are currently suggested 
(e.g., deficiencies of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphate), with recommendations to correct obvious 
deficiencies.  
In the paediatric population, the Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C) involves 
multi-organ function impairment according to a literature review (Hoste, Van Paemel, and Haerynck

vaccines)

2021); thrombotic complications affected only 13 out of 928 paediatric patients with MIS-C but 
included serious events (2 splenic infarctions and 5 cerebral strokes during ECMO). 
PRAC Assessment   
The association between coagulation abnormalities and COVID-19 disease is now rather well 
documented including in recent literature review papers. The literature review  by Raadsen M et al. 
(2021) can be cited as an example.  The authors discuss the Thrombocytopenia in Virus Infections 
and there is a paragraph on SARS-COV2.  Consistently with the EMA report, the authors describe 
several mechanisms involving hypercoagulability and inflammation interact resulting in thrombotic 
phenomena, both in the microvasculature and in the larger, mostly pulmonary blood vessels. 
Current recommendations in the EMA report for clinical management of coagulation abnormalities in 
COVID-19 are based on medicines and approaches that are used widely and generally for prophylaxis 
and treatment as for other critically ill or ICU-hospitalised patients.

3.1.7.2.  Hypothesis based on cases: 
1.  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia- like syndrome (HIT) 
This hypothesis is less documented and further information is still being collected.  
The hypothesis was presented by {Member State} and is presented below. Based on this hypothesis, 
the etiology of the clinical presentation observed in patients would be a cascade of reactions  triggered 
by the combination of heparin with Platelet Factor 4. 
This hypothesis would be consistent with the HIT-like syndrome associated with thrombocytopenia and 
sometimes evolving into Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 
also associated with thrombocytopenia.  
The  hypothesis  of  HITT-like  syndrome  is  supported  by  some  thoughts  and  comments  by  EMA 
haematologist experts and by Member States. 
Analysis from EMA experts  
Haematologist: A heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-like syndrome could be a possibility and explain 
the  triad  of  thrombocytopenia,  thrombosis  and  bleeding.  Indeed,  pseudo-HIT  would  fit  better  than 
TTP. Some factors supporting this theory are: 
- HIT is more common in women than men. 
-  HIT  is  more  frequent  when  there  is  some  inflammatory  background  (surgery/trauma)  than  when 
heparin is administered in other contexts. I believe that something in common to all fatal cases from 
this series is a systemic inflammatory syndrome.

Page 35/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
There are, however, some differences: 
-  HIT  is  a  serious  disease,  with  a  mortality  that  can  reach  20%,  but  the  cause  of  death  is  typically 
thrombosis (e.g. stroke). DIC is a rare complication of HIT. 
-  The  importance  of  thrombotic  events  explains  why  anticoagulation  with  an  alternative  agent  (e.g. 
danaparoid) is a very important part of therapy. The fatal cases from this series all ended up having 
DIC, where anticoagulation would have been difficult/controversial. 
-  In  HIT,  heparin  is  administered  continuously,  and  this  continuous  “antigen”  administration  self-
perpetuates  the  immune  response,  whereas  stopping  the  heparin  typically  improves  the  problem. 
Indeed,  HIT  is  clearly  associated  with  length  of  heparin  therapy.  The  same  applies  to  many  other 
immune-related  drug  reactions.  In  contrast,  here  we  are  dealing  with  a  single  administration  of  a 
“drug”,  so  the  mechanism  must  be  somewhat  different.  Or,  for  these  patients  this  was  not  the  first 
encounter with the antigen. This raises the question as to whether fatal cases went through COVID-19 
disease before vaccination. 
Cardiologist: Agree with these comments and in particular the difference related to the prolonged (or 
repeated) administration of antigen in immune‐mediated HIT vs single administration of vaccine. Also 
the recovery from thrombocytopenia follows within day when the administration of heparin is stopped. 
But similar to what is observed with several cases here there is often in HIT this few days/weeks delay 
in development of thrombocytopenia/clinical picture (unless repeated  exposure where the symptoms 
develop more rapidly). 
Analysis from Member State  
Some of the case stories including the Member State case, involve primarily younger, previously 
relatively healthy women (and two men) who developed thrombocytopenia, bleeding and thrombosis 
all within 7-10 days of vaccination with the AZ vaccine.  A theory has now been raised that the 
mechanism behind the clinical presentation could be similar to what is seen in cases of heparin 
induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), except that the immunological response could be triggered by the 
AZ vaccine rather than heparin. 
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia occurs very rarely and it is not possible to pinpoint in advance 
which patients are at increased risk of developing this condition. Heparin triggers an immunological 
response leading to thrombocytopenia, bleeding and thrombosis. The time to onset is typically 5-7 
days. The cases with the AZ vaccine had time to onset of the serious adverse event within 7-10 days 
in patients with a clinical presentation very similar to that seen with HIT.  
Given that the factor(s) involved in the development of thrombocytopenia, bleeding and thrombosis, it 
is difficult, from quality perspective, to know what to look for. Although, at this stage, it does not 
seem likely, that the events seen is quality related, this should not be excluded. While it is clear that 
the AZ vaccine does not contain heparin, the question remains whether something else, related to the 
quality of the AZ vaccine, could have been involved in causing the events seen. Any possible option 
should be taken into consideration, such as: possible quality defects, a particular excipient, or a 
product- or process related impurity, originating from a particular step in the manufacturing process, 
and which may trigger a similar immunological response as seen in cases of HIT. It should also be 
considered if batches involved in the currently reported events is from a particular drug substance- or 
drug product site.

PRAC  Assessment comment on HITT hypothesis 
It should be noted that the relevant information to substantiate this hypothesis is still being collected 
and more data is expected from experts and from MAH by the time of PRAC discussion of 18 March 
2021. 
The possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like syndrome triggered by a component in 
the vaccine is evaluated by experts. The clinical picture is quite similar. It seems that the 
pathophysiological mechanism involved may mimic the HIT entity, with platelets as a direct target. 
This remains to be demonstrated. 
2.  Other hypothesis: 
•  COVID-19 disease  
As described above, COVID-19 is known to be associated with coagulation abnormalities (see section 
3.1.7.1).  Confounding effect or underdiagnosis of covid-19 disease cannot be excluded. 
Comments from Member State 
We note that in the 4 Member State cases, the time to onset is 10 days or less after what seems to be 
the first dose of the vaccine in the three that specify TTO. It takes 3 weeks for protection to start after 
the first AZ dose, hence these patients would not yet have immunity to COVID-19. We also noted the 
temporal relationship described in the fatal and complex cases in the signal AR.  Case 1 had a fever 
when she presented with headache. Of note, in addition to thrombocytopenia, she also had elevated D-
dimer. 
Thrombotic events may be the presenting feature of COVID-19 which causes a hypercoaguable state, 
including thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer levels and prolonged PT (Jafari 2020) [20]. VTE in 
COVID includes PE, DVT and as well as ‘immunothrombosis’ in smaller pulmonary arteries and 
capillaries (BTS Guidance on Venous Thromboembolic Disease in patients with COVID-19, 2021) [21]. 
Thrombotic complications in COVID-19 also include MI and ischaemic stroke (Piazza & Morrow 2020) 
[22].  
There are also numerous literature publications specifically concerning cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis (CVST) in young patients with COVID-19 (e.g. Abouhashem 2020) [23], even without risk 
factors for VTE, and it has been described as a presenting feature (Hughes 2020) [24]. We note one 
case series in which one patient was on oral contraception additionally (Cavalcanti 2020) [25], and 
there is a further case in which CVST was accompanied by coagulopathy (Sugiyama 2020) [26]. There 
is also a further case which was accompanied by internal iliac vein thrombosis related to 
paucisymptomatic infection with COVID-19 (Beretta 2020). In this case, nasopharyngeal swab, 
repeated twice, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 – it was serological tests that confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection.  
A recent literature review of CVST in COVID-19 identified 9 studies and 14 patients (Tu 2020) [15]. 
The median age was 43 years (IQR=36-58) and majority had no significant past medical conditions 
(60.0%). The time taken from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST diagnosis was a median of 7 
days (IQR=6-14). A significant proportion of patients had raised D-dimer (75.0%). Overall mortality 
rate was 45.5%. It also seems that women may be affected more frequently (Nwajei 2020) [27]. A 
further publication advises that COVID-19 patients with a preexisting hypercoagulable state, such as 
pregnant/ postpartum women, women using OCPs, those in a fasting state, and those with history of 
thrombophilia, malignancy, and chronic inflammatory diseases are high-risk groups (Shakibajahromi 
2020) [28]. Indeed, we note that three of the  cases are on CHCs and in one, tranexamic acid is listed 
as a concomitant medication. This publication also highlights that elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen level, 
fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), and thrombocytopenia are commonly reported laboratory 
abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, with higher rates in severe disease. It further noted that CVST 
Signal assessment report on embolic and thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) – COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (Other viral 
vaccines)  
EMA/PRAC/157045/2021  
Page 37/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
and COVID-19 might present with haemorrhagic infarction as the first imaging manifestation and that 
the presence of any unexplained and atypical haemorrhagic lesion in the initial brain CT of these 
patients should raise the suspicion to CVST. A meta-analysis estimated the risk of CVST among 
hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to be 0.08% (95% CI 0.01% - 0.5%) (Baldini 2021) [29].  
We further note that there are a number of published case reports describing portal vein thrombosis in 
previously healthy young males (Borazjani 2020 [30], Franco Moreno 2020 [31], Jafari 2020 [20]), 
and one publication describes COVID-19 as a novel aetiology of this condition (Hassan 2021) [32]. 
Mesenteric ischaemia can also be a presenting feature of COVID-19 or may occur at a late stage in the 
disease, as described in a recent case series (Singh 2021) [33].  
We further note that DIC has been described in association with COVID-19 (Asakura & Ogawa 2020) 
[34[34]. A recent paper has proposed a definition for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC), based 
on clinical and laboratory features (Iba 2021) [35]. This includes proven COVID-19 test with two or 
more of the following four criteria: (1) decrease in platelet count (less than 150 × 109/L); (2) increase 
in D-dimer (more than two times the upper limit of normal); (3) >1 s prolonged prothrombin time or 
INR > 1.2; (4) presence of thrombosis (macrothrombosis including deep vein thrombosis/venous 
thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, limb artery thrombosis, mesenteric 
artery thrombosis, etc., and/or microthrombosis including skin, acral lesions, etc.) (Iba 2021) [35]. If 
the patient meets one of the above 4 criteria and also one or more of following criteria: (i) increase in 
fibrinogen level; (ii) increased VWF (more than two times the upper normal limit); (iii) presence of 
lupus anticoagulant and/or high-titer antiphospholipid antibodies, they are defined as “risk of CAC”.  
It may also be worth considering that the accuracy of viral RNA swabs in clinical practice varies 
depending on the site and quality of sampling. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR generally 
confirms the diagnosis of COVID, and CDC indicates that confirmatory laboratory evidence is detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a clinical specimen using a molecular amplification detection test. However, 
false negatives may occur (Woloshin 2020) [36]. Accuracy varies by site and stage of disease and 
degree of viral multiplication or clearance (Watson 2020) [37]. The CDC definition of severe Covid 
indicates RNA to be confirmatory laboratory evidence, but it can be diagnosed on presumptive 
laboratory evidence including detection of specific antigen in a clinical specimen or detection of specific 
antibody. However, antibody testing should be undertaken at least two weeks after onset of symptoms 
and the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests vary over time, hence results should be interpreted 
in the context of clinical history and depends not only on the accuracy of the test itself, but also the 
pre-test probability of infection. At days 1-7, the sensitivity of IgM testing is only 23.2%, increasing to 
58.4% at days 8-14. Similarly, for IgG, sensitivity at day 1-2 will be 29.7%, increasing to 66.5% day 
8-14. A single negative test result may not be informative if the pre-test probability is high (Watson 
2020) [38].  
We suggest that it may be warranted to consider COVID-19 an alternative aetiology, particularly in 
cases of VTE and ATE which are very unusual and/or associated with thrombocytopenia, elevated D-
dimer levels and prolonged PT. It may also need to be considered that background rates of VTE and 
ATE including rare types of events measured prior to 2020 may not be reflective of the current 
background rate, with the virus in circulation.  
PRAC assessment comment on “COVID-19 disease” hypothesis 
This hypothesis is mechanistically plausible. However  this  is not  supported by  the negative PCR and 
serologic results in some patients experiencing coagulation abnormalities. 
It cannot be excluded  that COVID-19 might be  part  of the possible  explanations but  it is  hardly the 
only one.  
Many  of  the  people  affected  by  this  clinical  picture  suffer  from  auto-immune  or  allergic  pre-existing 
conditions (asthma, psoriasis, drug allergies, auto-immune thyroiditis or other auto-immune disease) 
or a chronic hepatitis B (2 cases) that may play a role as chronic immune stimulation.

Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  COVID19  infection  is  associated  with  tremendous  thrombotic 
complications, whose complete pathophysiology is not well understood, it is logical to suspect that the 
immune  responses  associated  with  COVID19  infection  and  COVID-19  vaccination  may  share  some 
similarities  that  would increase  the  risk  of  thrombotic  event.  We  could  imagine  that  the  S-specific T 
cell immune response may induce a cross reaction with a specific human protein or antigen involved 
in the hemostatic system (and leading to platelet activation and/or consumption) in people particularly 
sensitive  because  of  a  “reactive”  immune  system.  The  phenomenon  of  “molecular  mimicry”  in  the 
situation of vaccines has been well  reviewed by Segal  et al. 2018  [39]. Regarding the timing of the 
immune  response  following  vaccination,  we  know  that  the  immune  response  starts  quickly  after 
vaccine  administration  (as  evidenced  by  fever  or  systemic  symptoms  starting  few  hours  after 
vaccination)  and,  even  if 3  weeks  are  needed  to  achieve  immunity  against  COVID19,  the  process  is 
launched  immediately  and  the  production  of  antibodies  is  only  part  of  the  global  immune  response 
triggered by  vaccination. However,  this  hypothesis  would not  explain  why  a  particular  occurrence  of 
this  clinical  picture  is  described  after  the  AstraZeneca  vaccine  compared  to  other  non-adenovirus 
COVID19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna).

Analysis from Member State  
General clinical overview of cases: 
For assessment of possible pathogenicity mechanisms, a general overview of the clinical issue(s) is 
obviously the first step. This general clinical overview is provided in the following.  
It should be stressed that the information is preliminary and incomplete, as cases are still 
accumulating, several patients are in intensive care or recovering (outcomes unknown), and details 
for the diagnostic hematology workup for patients is lacking (translation of hospital records is 
pending). 
So far,  EMA/PRAC, is aware of a total of approx. 15 cases of thromboembolic events combined with 
thrombocytopenia associated with use of the AZ COVID-19 vaccine. 
The cases had the following in common: 
Most cases occurred in individuals < 50 years of age, i.e. the younger age group (no sex 
predisposition). 
Most cases occurred within 10 days of the 1st vaccine dose, in otherwise generally healthy individuals. 
Specifically, COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolic events, but there was no history of active 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cases. 
Many cases had fatal outcomes. 
Most of the cases presented with one or more of the following symptoms: Thrombosis affecting 
different organ systems (CNS, lung, spleen, gastrointestinal tract) and including large vessels 
(cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in 5 individuals, in others thromboses affected portal vein, splenic 
vein, pelvic vein, femoral artery, common carotid artery), thrombocytopenia (presumably secondary

to thrombosis, i.e. consumptive), bleeding, petechiae and multiorgan failure. 
Platelet counts were in most cases in the 15 - 80 x 1E9/L range (i.e. above the very low levels often 
seen with drug-induced thrombocytopenia) [40]. 
The following observations are also considered relevant as regards evaluation of pathogenicity 
mechanisms: 
In 3 of the apprx. 15 cases of thromboembolic events combined with thrombocytopenia, Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis was reported as co-morbidity. 
In 3 of 13 other cases registered with monosymptomatic thrombocytopenia within 14 days of 
vaccination with AZ vaccine, comprising mostly older individuals (median age 63.5 years), idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (IPC) was reported as co-morbidity, and in these cases, flare-up of the 
purpura was seen after vaccination. 
Both observations above suggest a possible auto-immune/immune component behind the 
thrombocytopenic and thromboembolic events. 
In short, the cases appear to exhibit a general clinical presentation of moderate thrombocytopenia 
combined with pro-thrombotic predilection, affecting also large vessels. 
Interestingly, this clinical presentation is considered to be quite similar to heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia [40, 41]. It should be stressed, however, that there was no history of heparin 
treatment prior to thrombosis in these cases (some patients were treated with heparin after 
thrombosis was evident). 
Description of vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222): 
The active component in the vaccine is a replication incompetent chimpanzee adenovirus vector 
(ChAdOx1), encoding the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (based on the original index Wuhan-
1 sequence, codon-optimized, with a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence). 
The adenovirus particles are formulated in L-histidine (pH 6.6), NaCl, MgCl2,  EDTA, sucrose, ethanol, 
polysorbate-80 (tween 80). One dose (0.5 mL) contains ≥ 2.5E8 infectious units of adenovirus 
particles. 
Following intramuscular injection, the adenovirus vector is thought to transduce primarily muscle cells 
and fibroblasts at the injection site, and professional antigen presenting cells in draining lymph nodes, 
causing expression of the trimeric native-like prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on cell 
surfaces (antigen-presenting cells also expected to display processed form of the spike antigen, not 
detailed) [42]. 
This mode and pattern of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen presentation is essentially identical between 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 and eg mRNA-based vaccines. Also, all currently approved COVID-19 
vaccines employ spike immunogen based on the sequence of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the 
index human case in December 2019 (Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate) [43]. 
Possible vaccine-specific pathogenic mechanisms for combined 
thromboembolic/thrombocytopenic effects: 
The following 3 pathogenic mechanisms were considered: 
Hypothetical mechanism #1: Issue is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunogen encoded 
by the chimpanzee adenovirus vector. This mechanism was considered un-likely, as the mode and 
pattern of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen presentation (on the surface of muscle cells and fibroblasts at

intramuscular injection sites, and by antigen-presenting cells in draining lymph nodes) is not vaccine-
specific (is shared with mRNA vaccines, which also employ very similar Wuhan-based spike 
immunogens). 
Hypothetical mechanism #2. Issue is caused by product impurities and/or excipients: This mechanism 
was considered un-likely, because (i) the vaccine excipients (detailed above) are not considered to be 
associated with thromboembolic risk, and (ii) the issue has to our knowledge not associated with 
certain batches of product (which would have been expected if the cause was eg contamination with 
endotoxin or other pro-thrombotic compounds). 
Hypothetical mechanism #3. Issue is caused by the chimpanzee adenovirus vector: 
Replication in-competent adenovirus vectors based on different serotypes of human adenoviruses are 
known to be able to cause thrombosis, secondary (consumptive) thrombocytopenia and disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, potentially leading to multiorgan failure and death, especially after 
intravenous injection of virus particles. This has been consistently described in preclinical models eg 
nonhuman primates and rabbits, and one fatality has also been reported in a phase 1 clinical trial [44-
49]. 
The pro-thrombotic effects of adenovirus vectors are considered to be caused by a combination of the 
following pathways/sub-mechanisms [44-49]: 
Binding of adenovirus to platelets, causing platelet activation and thrombosis. 
•  Specifically, aggregation and activation of platelets is mediated by so called RGD motifs in 
the pentn base of adenovirus particles, binding to alphaIIb/beta3 integrins on platelet 
surfaces [44]. 
• 
Interestingly, adenovirus particles can also bind platelet factor 4, the platelet antigen 
considered to be responsible for triggering heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [40, 41, 
50].  
• 
Thus, it is likely that antibody production against vector and/or platelet self antigens can 
might aggravate platelet activation, as is known from eg histamine-induced 
thrombocytopenia [40, 41]. 
•  Binding of adenovirus particles to endothelial cells, causing endothelial activation and 
thrombosis. 
•  Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; cytokine storm), which in itself activated 
platelets and endothelia. 
•  Auto-amplification loops, where initial adenovirus vector-mediated injury to thrombocytes and 
endothelia self-amplify (as is also known from eg heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and 
disseminated intravascular coagulations) [40, 41]. 
None of pathways/sub-mechanisms above require active adenovirus replication in platelets or 
endothelia (all are triggered by simple binding of virus vectors to cell surfaces). 
Due to the overall similarity in the build of adenovirus particles, it is considered likely that the 
abovementioned pro-thrombotic effects are also shared by chimpanzee adenoviruses such as the 
ChAdOx1 vector employed in the AZ vaccine. 
At the same time, it is considered likely that due to the sequence differences in the RGD loops 
between ChAdOx1and human adenoviruses [51], the risk profile of the AZ vaccine may in this respect

vaccines)

Page 41/50 
 
 
 
 
differ from vaccines based on human adenoviruses. 
As mentioned, while the pathways/sub-mechanisms above are triggered by binding of virus vectors to 
cell surfaces, the thromboembolic mechanisms thus triggered can proceed and propagate due to self-
amplifying feedback mechanisms; likely for this reason, the relationship between dose of vector and 
toxicity is non-linear, with dramatic differences in scope and severity of toxicity noted with only 
modest increases of vector dose at higher doses [49].  
Also, there is substantial subject-to-subject variation in the toxicity of adenovirus vectors in humans 
[51]. The causes for this are unknown, but may relate to known genetic polymorphisms in eg 
alphaIIb/beta3 integrins or Fc receptors on platelet surfaces. 
It should be stressed that such pro-thrombotic effects of adenovirus vectors in humans is exceedingly 
rare [49]. 
For all the reasons above, it is concluded that if the AZ vaccine causes the observed 
thrombotic/thrombocytopenic events, this is most likely caused by the ChAdOx1 vector. 
Finally, it should be mentioned that the mechanisms described above for adenovirus-mediated pro-
thrombotic effects are very similar to the mechanisms described for heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia ([40, 41, 44-51]; not further detailed here). This similarity in clinical presentations 
between thrombotic/thrombocytopenic events associated with AZ vaccine use and heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia has also been remarked on in the latest EMA assessment. 
PRAC Assessment  on Adenovirus hypothesis  
This hypothesis is mechanistically plausible but not supported by the fact that IV administration might 
be needed to observe the abnormalities. However the latter should be nuanced due to known 
challenges in the implementation of the “syringe-not-in-vessel” test in the context of massive 
vaccination. 
The hypothesis is also consistent with the different O/E computed with non-adenovirus vaccines 
(Pfizer and Moderna) and compatible with the negative PCR and serologic results in some patients. 
As mentioned by other experts, a thrombocytopenia following the administration of adenoviral gene 
transfer vectors has been described, involving von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. It is true that the 
“syringe-not-in-vessel” test is hardly ever realized by vaccinators and that the risk of intravenous 
injection may possibly increase the risk of activation of this thrombocytopenic mechanism. However,  
it is considered unlikely that the thrombotic complications possibly associated with the vaccine would 
be imputed to adenovirus and would have no pathophysiological link with the thrombotic 
complications observed with COVID19 infections. 
•  ChAdOx coexpression Tissue plasminogen activator 
There  might  be  a  potential  role  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator  (tPA)  leader  sequence  in  a 
thrombotic/thromcytopenia  disorder  (The  active  substance  consists  of  a  recombinant,  replication-
deficient (E1 and E3 deleted) chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV-
19) spike protein combined with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence).

Comment from Member State 
The COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca does not only code for the protein S but includes a tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence, to increase immunogenicity [42]. tPA is used as a 
heterologous targeting signal sequence to traffic the protein to the cell secretion pathway to increase 
expression membrane. This has been shown to enhance the strength of the immune response against 
antigens having this signal sequence [52]. It may be hypothesised that such a supplement is likely to 
interfere with plasminogen activator, i.e. with the coagulation system. 
The entire tPA sequence is available in GenBank [53]. The signal sequence is coded by bp 63 to 167, 
to yield after in silico translation a 36 aa peptide (i.e. 
MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSPSQEIHARFRRGARS). Considering the length of the peptide it has been 
hypothesised that it may play another role in addition to targeting cellular secretion pathways. 
However, it is unknown if it could cause thrombosis.  
Furthermore, the strong expression and the secretion of a large amount of the spike protein, per se, 
may cause blood clots in predisposed individuals, especially in conjunction with calling a strong 
immune response to the S protein. 
Finally, it is not known whether this sequence is cleaved from the product before it is secreted. 
Usually it is, but not always. It can be checked virtually if the junction of the tPA sequence and the S 
protein is susceptible to induce the production of antibodies. 
CHMP comment on tPA 
So far as we did not receive any (non-clinical) documentation from the company for the 
characterization of these specific antigens. 
It is considered unlikely that a signal sequence, which is meant to translocate a protein to the cellular 
surface, interferes with the function of proteins who happen to possess the same signal sequence.  
However, this is not considered the most important aspect. tPA initiates clot lysis (through 
plasminogen activation to plasmin). It does not directly interfere with the coagulation pathway itself 
(in other words, it does not inhibit DIC, consumption of coagulation factors, and other markers of a 
hypercoagulable state).  
Most importantly, tPA/plasmin does not interfere with platelet function, and the defining new factor of 
the current signals/reports is thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is the result of platelet 
consumption or destruction (or decreased platelet formation, which in this case also considered 
unlikely). 
As an aside, it is important to discriminate between coagulation in the strict sense (fibrin clot 
formation which involves coagulation factors II-XIII) and platelet function/activation (which involves 
vWF and various platelet receptors). Both result in what is loosely termed hemostasis, thrombus 
formation and (in pathological states) thrombosis – however, these two mechanisms are quite 
different. 
PRAC Assessment on tPA 
In general, leader sequences are meant to guide proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for

secretion. In principle the leader sequence is cleaved off. If cleavage does not occur, the fusion 
protein (tPA leader- Spike protein) remains anchored in the membrane of the cell and cannot be 
secreted. Furthermore, the tPA leader sequence has been shown to improve immunogenicity of an 
MVA vector vaccine by enhancing secretion of the antigen. 
In principle, the leader sequence remains incorporated in the membrane and is recycled and degraded 
within the cell. Even if it would be released, there is no scientific evidence that this sequence could 
activate any pathways involved in hemostasis or coagulation. 
Finally, one might speculate that the Spike protein itself could activate particular signalling pathways. 
However, there is no confirmed scientific rationale supporting this at this stage. 
It could be also highlighted that the construct used in the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca encodes for 
the Spike protein sequence which has not been modified. All other vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, JNJ) 
have modified the sequence in order to stabilise the Spike protein in the pre-fusion state. However, 
this is not expected to have an impact on possible thrombosis events.  
3.1.8.  Conclusion 
Based on the review of clinical and non-clinical data (DLP 7 Dec 2020), there is currently no evidence 
to suggest an association of thrombotic events with the use of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.  
The preliminary information from the BWP concluded that there is no indication so far that SAE are 
linked to the quality of the vaccine (16 March 2021). Follow-up questions for specific batches were 
made to the MAH. 
Based on the available observed-to-expected analysis by the MAH and EMA, there is currently 
insufficient evidence to suggest there would be an increased risk of embolic and thrombotic events 
associated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.  
However, a signal was noted for rare events, such as Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Cerebral 
venous sinus thrombosis and Haemorrhagic stroke warranting further investigation. This could be 
described as a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like/heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with 
thrombosis (HITT)-like phenomenon. Available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal association 
and further assessement is needed.  
Given the uncertainty in the case definitions of interest as this issue has progressed, further 
investigation on a possible underlying mechanism is needed. Following gaps in knowledge and 
recommendations are currently identified: 
1.  Importance of ruling out COVID-19 disease as an alternative diagnosis in the cases reported as 
thrombotic events may be the presenting feature of COVID-19;  
2.  Further exploration of case definitions of interest for continued monitoring and expert review; 
3.  Further refinement of observed to expected analsyis at the level of background rates and 
exposure by e.g. age-group, including sensitivity analysis. Of note is also that the rates  
measured prior to 2020 may not be reflective of the current background rate, with the virus in 
circulation. 
4.  Ad hoc expert group for further discussions on possible hypotheses, pathophysiological 
mechanisms, and possible underlying risk factors.

3.2.  PRAC proposed recommendation 
The PRAC  recommends an update of section 4.4 of the SmPC, which should include the following 
elements: 
•  Description of the clinical entity i.e. a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like/heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT)-like phenomenon; 
•  Statement that some cases have been presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, 
cerebral vein thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation; that there is currently 
insufficient evidence to establish a definitive causal relationship with the vaccine; that cases 
mainly occurred i.e. women < 55 year; 
•  Statement that the benefit/risk in individuals at increased risk of thromboembolic events 
(including autoimmune disease, oral contraceptive use, or prior history of thromboembolic 
events) should be evaluated before vaccination.  
Moreover instructions to physicians and patients to be alert on specific signs and sympotoms should be 
included. 
This information needs to be communicated within the SmPC /PIL and additionally via a DHPC (under 
discussion with the MAH). 
Finally, the following issues need to be adressed: 
1.  Importance of ruling out COVID-19 disease as an alternative diagnosis in the cases reported as 
thrombotic events may be the presenting feature of COVID-19;  
2.  Further exploration of case definitions of interest for continued monitoring and expert review; 
3.  Further refinement of observed to expected analsyis at the level of background rates and 
exposure by e.g. age-group, including sensitivity analysis. Of note is also that the rates  
measured prior to 2020 may not be reflective of the current background rate, with the virus in 
circulation. 
4.  Ad hoc expert group for further discussions on possible hypotheses, pathophysiological 
mechanisms, and possible underlying risk factors. 
These recommendations are based on a preliminary assessement that will be discussed during the 
extraordinary PRAC of 18 March 2021, where additional information will be provided by the MAH, EMA 
and Member States.  
3.3.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
The PRAC has reviewed the available evidence on the occurrence of thromboembolic events following 
the administration of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, using a wide range of sources including 
spontaneous case reports in EudraVigilance, quality, clinical, pre-clinical and literature data and 
additional data from the MAH. The review of EudraVigilance data included observed-to-expected 
analyses that pointed to possible signals of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, as well as an individual case review that suggested a possible pattern in

women below 55 years with a time-to-onset within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. The PRAC has also 
explored possible pathophysiological explanations for the observed cases. 
The PRAC has concluded that there may be a risk of rare thrombotic events accompanied by 
thrombocytopenia following receipt of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca that needs to be reflected in the 
product information, while further evidence is being collected.  
The PRAC recommends by a majority of 31 out of 32 votes that the MAH for COVID-19 Vaccine 
AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca AB) should submit a variation by 19 March 2021 to amend the product 
information as described below (new text underlined/text to be removed with strikethrough): 
Summary of Product Characteristics  
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders  
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been 
observed very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. This includes severe 
cases presenting as venous thrombosis, including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with 
thrombocytopenia. The majority of these cases occurred within the first seven to fourteen days 
following vaccination and occurred in women under 55 years of age, however this may reflect the 
increased use of the vaccine in this population. Some cases had a fatal outcome. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent 
headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.  
Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving 
anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals.

Blood disorders 
A combination of blood clots and low level of platelets, in some cases together with bleeding, has been 
observed very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. This included some 
severe cases with blood clots in different or unusual locations and excessive clotting or bleeding 
throughout the body. The majority of these cases occurred within the first seven to fourteen days 
following vaccination and mostly occurred in women under 55 years of age, however more women 
under 55 received the vaccine than other people. Some cases had a fatal outcome. 
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or 
persistent abdominal pain following vaccination.

beyond the site of vaccination which appears after a few days. 
OnePRAC member disagreeds with the above-mentioned recommendation of the PRAC.  
The MAH should distribute a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) according to the text 
and communication plan agreed with the CHMP . 
The PRAC has also agreed that an ad hoc expert meeting should be convened to further discuss 
possible hypotheses, pathophysiological mechanisms, and possible underlying risk factors.

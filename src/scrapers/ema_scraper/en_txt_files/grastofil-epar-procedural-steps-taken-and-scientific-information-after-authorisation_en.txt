1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update the product information to include the 
paediatric population in the currently approved 
indication for use in adults, as per the reference 
product SmPC, and to introduce graduations on the 
syringe barrel enabling use of the Grastofil in 
accordance with the paediatric posology. Sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 6.5 of the SmPC and Section 3 and 
6 of the Package Leaflet have been updated with the 
paediatric use. In addition, Sections 5.1 and 6.6 of 
the SmPC have been updated in alignment with the 
Neupogen PI. 
C.I.2.b - Change in the SPC, Labelling or PL of a

minor graduations in the existing prefilled syringe for both 
strengths in order to include the paediatric population in 
the currently approved indication, as per the reference 
product SmPC, The MAH conducted two dose accuracy 
studies, one study evaluating 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mL 
graduations and the second study evaluating minor 
gradations at increments of 0.025 mL. The results from the 
second study confirm a similar level of error margin as seen 
in the initial study. The data demonstrate that higher 
variances are not evident at the 0.025 mL graduations 
relative to the 0.1 mL graduations. The product information 
has been updated in alignment with the Neupogen PI. The 
benefit risk of Grastofil use in the paediatric population is 
considered positive.

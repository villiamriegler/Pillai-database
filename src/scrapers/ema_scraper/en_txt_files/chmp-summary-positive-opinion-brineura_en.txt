Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Brineura 
cerliponase alfa 
On 21 April 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Brineura, 
intended for the treatment of CLN2 disease. Brineura, which was designated as an orphan medicinal 
product on 12 March 2013, was reviewed under EMA’s accelerated assessment programme. The applicant 
for this medicinal product is BioMarin International Limited. 
Brineura will be available as a solution for intracerebroventricular infusion (150 mg). The active substance 
of Brineura is cerliponase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ATC code: A16AB). It works by replacing 
the missing enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase-1 in patients with a lysosomal storage disorder called CLN2 
disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2), reducing build-up of lipofuscins. 
The benefits with Brineura are its ability to slow the progression of motor and language decline. The most 
common side effects are pyrexia, vomiting and hypersensitivity. 
The full indication is: "Brineura is indicated for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 
(CLN2) disease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency." 
Brineura must only be administered by a trained healthcare professional knowledgeable in 
intracerebroventricular administration.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

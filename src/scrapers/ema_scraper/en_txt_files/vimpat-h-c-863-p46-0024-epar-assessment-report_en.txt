2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Methods 
EP0008 was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered LCM as adjunctive therapy in Japanese and 
Chinese adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. 
Subjects were required to be on a stable dose of at least 1 but no more than 3 concomitant 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
The duration of the study per subject was up to 27 weeks, including an 8-week Baseline Period and a 
16-week Treatment Period. Subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria should have been enrolled and 
entered into a Baseline Period (8 weeks) to assess concomitant medications (including AED[s]), 
adverse events (AEs), and Baseline seizure frequency to ensure consistency with entry criteria before 
subjects were eligible to be randomized. 
At the end of the Baseline Period, subjects were randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 
the 3 treatment groups: placebo (twice a day), LCM 200mg/day (100mg twice a day), or LCM 
400mg/day (200mg twice a day). The Treatment Period consisted of the following periods: a 4-week 
forced titration up to the respective randomized dose of LCM (200mg/day or 400mg/day) or placebo 
(referred to as the Titration Period) and a 12-week maintenance on the dose achieved during the 
Titration Period (referred to as the Maintenance Period). A single back-titration at the end of the 
Titration Period was allowed (LCM 200mg/day to LCM 100mg/day; LCM 400mg/day to LCM 
300mg/day) if the subject was unable to tolerate the randomized target dose. Once the dose had been 
reduced, it could not be increased in the Maintenance Period. The Treatment Period was followed by a 
blinded 2-week Transition Period or a blinded 3-week Taper Period. In general, this study design was 
consistent with previous pivotal studies for the EU registration of LCM (SP667, SP754, and SP755). 
Subjects who completed the Titration Period entered the 12-week Maintenance Period. Subjects were 
maintained on the dose achieved during the Titration Period. Subjects who required dose reduction 
during the Maintenance Period must have been withdrawn from the study. 
After completion of the Maintenance Period, subjects had the option of enrolling in EP0009, an open-
label extension study for continuation of LCM treatment and assessment of long-term safety and 
maintenance of efficacy; the blinded Transition Period was required for these subjects. 
The blinded Taper Period was required for subjects who withdrew during the Titration or Maintenance 
Periods, and for those who completed the Maintenance Period and chose not to enroll in EP0009. 
Subjects who withdrew during the Titration or Maintenance Periods came back for the Final Visit 2 
weeks after the final study medication intake. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
The primary efficacy variable was the change in partial-onset seizure frequency per 28 days from 
Baseline to the Maintenance Period, as requested by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in 
Japan. Key secondary efficacy variables included the 50% response to treatment from Baseline to the 
Rapporteur’s final assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance 
with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/382241/2015

Maintenance Period and the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline to the 
Maintenance Period. 
Consistent with previous studies (SP667, SP754, and SP755), LCM at doses of 200 and 400mg/day 
was efficacious in reducing partial-onset seizure frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with 1 to 3 
approved concomitant AEDs in Chinese and Japanese subjects ≥16 years of age with uncontrolled 
epilepsy. 
Efficacy data was not evaluated separately for the adolescent subjects 16 or 17 years of age. 
Safety results 
Of the 548 total subjects who were randomized to treatment, 35 were 16 or 17 years of age at the 
time of study entry.  
The median age of the 35 adolescent subjects was 16.0. All subjects were of Asian descent. The 
gender distribution was similar between the placebo and LCM 200mg/day treatment groups with 6 of 
12 and 6 of 11 subjects being male, respectively; however, the proportion of males was higher than 
females in the LCM 400mg/day group (10 of 12 subjects). 
Median body mass index (BMI) was higher in the placebo group (21.32 kg/m2) than in either LCM 
group (19.05 and 18.92 kg/m2 for LCM 200mg/day and LCM 400mg/day, respectively). 
When evaluated by BMI category, none of the subjects who received placebo had a BMI at study entry 
<18.5kg/m2, compared with 4 of 11 subjects and 5 of 12 subjects in the LCM 200mg/day and LCM 
400mg/day groups, respectively. 
All 35 adolescent subjects were taking at least 1 AED concomitantly per an inclusion criterion for the 
study. The most commonly used AEDs taken by ≥7 adolescent subjects overall (≥20%) were 
carbamazepine (19 of 35 subjects), valproate (18 of 35 subjects), levetiracetam (12 of 35 subjects), 
lamotrigine (8 of 35 subjects), and topiramate (7 of 35 subjects). 
The median number of days of exposure to study drug among the adolescent subjects was identical 
across the 3 treatment groups for the Titration, Maintenance, and Treatment Periods with values of 
29.0, 84.0, and 113.0 days, respectively. 
Disposition for this small group of adolescent subjects was comparable to the overall population. 
Overall, 31 of the 35 adolescent subjects completed the study, and 4 of 35 discontinued the study due 
to an AE. Discontinuations from the study occurred in the LCM treatment groups with 1 of 11 subjects 
receiving LCM 200mg/day and 3 of 12 subjects receiving LCM 400mg/day. 
Thirty-three of the 35 subjects completed the Titration Period, and 31 completed the Maintenance and 
Transition Periods. Three of 35 subjects reduced their dose prior to entering the Maintenance Period, 
and these subjects included 1 subject from each treatment group.  
Subject disposition was summarized by treatment group, treatment period, and overall for the subjects 
who were randomized to treatment in EP0008 and were <18 years of age at study entry (Table 1).

A total of 62 TEAEs were reported by 17 of 23 subjects across the LCM treatment groups, and 20 
TEAEs were reported by 11 of 12 subjects in the placebo treatment group. 
The most common SOCs for TEAEs reported among the adolescent subjects receiving LCM were 
consistent with those observed in the adult population and included nervous system disorders (10 of 
23 subjects) and gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, and investigations (4 of 23 
subjects each). The most commonly reported TEAEs among subjects who received LCM were dizziness 
(8 of 23 subjects), headache (3 of 23 subjects), and vomiting (2 of 23 subjects). Headache and 
vomiting were only reported in the LCM 400mg/day group. 
Upper respiratory tract infection was experienced by 3 of 12 subjects in the placebo group and 2 of 23 
subjects in the LCM total group. Weight decreased was experienced by 2 of 12 subjects in the placebo 
group and 1 of 23 subjects in the LCM total group. 
All other PTs were experienced by ≤1 subject within any treatment group. 
Two subjects experienced an AE that was either an AE of special interest (syncope) for the LCM 
program or a partial-onset seizure related term (convulsion). One of 12 subjects in the LCM 
400mg/day group experienced mild syncope that was considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. One of 11 subjects in the LCM 200 mg/day experienced mild, intermittent convulsion that 
was considered not related to study drug by the investigator. 
Treatment-related AEs considered related to study drug by the investigator that occurred in >1 subject 
in any LCM treatment group are shown in Table 3.

Note: A subject may be counted more than once according to the relationship of the TEAEs. 
Note: Terms were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Version 16.1. 
Overall, the proportion of subjects with at least 1 related TEAE was higher in the LCM treatment groups 
than in the placebo group and increased with the higher daily LCM dose (2 of 12, 5 of 11, and 9 of 12 
subjects for the placebo, LCM 200mg/day, and LCM 400mg/day groups, respectively). 
The most commonly reported related TEAE among subjects who received LCM was dizziness (7 of 23 
subjects), and this incidence of related dizziness among subjects receiving LCM was higher than in the 
placebo group (2 of 12 subjects). Related events of headache and vomiting were only reported in the 
LCM 400mg/day group (2 of 12 subjects each). 
Deaths 
None of the 35 adolescent subjects who received study medication died during the clinical study. 
Serious adverse events 
One adolescent subject of 12 from the placebo treatment group experienced a serious TEAE of 
pneumonia that was considered unrelated to study drug. No serious TEAEs were reported in either LCM 
treatment group within this adolescent population. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events that led to discontinuation 
Four adolescent subjects discontinued the study due to at least 1 TEAE, and these subjects included 1 
of 11 subjects in the LCM 200mg/day group and 3 of 12 subjects in the LCM 400mg/day group. None 
of the adolescent subjects who received placebo discontinued the study due to a TEAE. 
Further details of the TEAEs that led to discontinuation are provided in Table 4

None of the events were deemed serious by the investigator. All the events were considered related to

All other PTs occurred in 1 subject each. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy data was not evaluated separately for the included 35 adolescent subjects 16 or 17 years of 
age. 
The safety profile among this adolescent Chinese and Japanese population was generally consistent 
with the established profile of LCM in subjects with partial-onset seizures. The most frequently 
reported adverse reactions with LCM treatment are dizziness, headache and nausea according to the 
current SmPC. Other AEs reported in the adolescent in this study are included in the AE profile 
described in the current SmPC, or AEs frequently reported in young adults (i.e. upper respiratory tract 
infections). Due to small sample sizes, it is difficult to interpret any small differences between 
treatment groups. To conclude, no new safety concerns were identified. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The safety profile of the 35 adolescent Chinese and Japanese subjects in EP0008 was consistent with 
what has been observed with adjunctive LCM treatment in subjects with partial-onse seizures in the 
pivotal studies. No new or major safety concerns were observed; therefore, the benefit/risk ratio 
remains favourable.

Overall conclusion 
This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The 
Paediatric Regulation). No changes to the approved EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT 
are being proposed. 
Recommendation  
X  Fulfilled: 
Additional clarifications requested 
One member state (MS) commented: 
The MS agrees with the rapporteur that no new safety concerns were identified in this procedure. 
However, it is noted that no efficacy results for the subgroup of adolescents were submitted by the 
MAH. This would be useful as a confirmation that efficacy outcomes in the paediatric subset are 
consistent with the favourable efficacy outcomes of the overall population studied. 
 MAH response in summary 
Considering that VIMPAT is already approved for use from 16 years of age in this indication in the EU 
and considering the low number of patients in this age group in the EP0008 study, UCB is of the 
opinion that a separate analysis of efficacy in this age group will not inform further on the benefit/risk 
profile of VIMPAT. 
In principle and from scientific standpoint, while it is acknowledged that one single severe adverse 
event may potentially impact the product information, inconsistent efficacy results in one or very few 
subjects are not expected to trigger any revision of a medicinal product for which the efficacy has been 
demonstrated through large scale well-controlled clinical studies. 
For the sake of transparency, individual patient listings on EP0008 subjects aged from 16 to 17 years 
are provided in Appendix 1 of this submission in Module 5.3.5.1. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The rapporteur agrees with the MAH that a separate analysis of efficacy in the 16 or 17 years of age 
group will not inform further on the benefit/risk profile of VIMPAT considering the low number of 
patients in this age group in the EP0008 study. For the sake of transparency, individual patient listings 
on EP0008 subjects aged from 16 to 17 years are provided by the MAH in Appendix 1 of this 
submission in Module 5.3.5.1. The rapporteur considers therefore the request outlined above by the 
MS is fulfilled. 
This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The 
Paediatric Regulation). No changes to the approved EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT 
are being proposed.  
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Intraocular lens replacement (ILR) is a common surgical procedure that has a high success rate. An 
adequately dilated pupil is important for safe and successful procedures. Small pupils are associated with an 
increased risk of complications. Although complications are rare, they can impair postoperative visual acuity 
and threaten sight. Therefore, it is important to maintain mydriasis and prevent miosis during the procedure. 
Reducing postoperative pain is an important goal. In addition, pain may cause patients anxiety about 
potential sight-threatening complications. Omidria was developed to address these aspects of ILR through 
combining into one drug product a mydriatic agent and an anti-inflammatory agent for intracameral irrigation 
during the procedure.  
About the product 
Omidria is a fixed dose combination of phenylephrine and ketorolac presented as a four mL liquid formulation 
to be diluted in 500 mL balanced salt solution and used as irrigation during ocular lens replacement surgery.  
Omidria is not a substitution therapy but is intended for use in conjunction with standard preoperative 
treatments. 
Omidria  added  to  standard  irrigation  solution  provides  constant  concentrations  of  PE  and  KE  at  the  target 
receptors and enzymes within the eye during ILR. Unlike preoperatively administered drugs (i.e. eye drops), 
which  are  washed  out  of  the  eye  by  the  irrigation  solution  used  during  ILR,  Omidria  continually  bathes  the 
intraocular structures throughout surgery.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
The development section of the drug product presented is extensive, and all aspects of the drug product 
development have been well covered. It describes the rationale for the use of two well-known active 
substances not previously used in fixed dose combination, and includes drug-drug interaction studies, a 
justification of the container closure system selected and compatibility studies with the proposed diluents: 
balanced salt solution (BSS) and balanced salt solution plus (BSS Plus). Critical product quality attributes that 
are likely to affect product safety and efficacy are identified and all are common for this type of product, i.e. 
identification, assay, purity, sterility, bacterial endotoxins.  
Since the product is intended to be used as irrigation solution during ocular surgery, sterility of the finished 
product was considered critical and the use of a sterilisation method providing the highest SAL possible was 
considered necessary. The originally proposed manufacturing process involved sterilising filtration and aseptic 
filling. However the CHMP considered that the choice of the sterilisation method was not in accordance with 
the Note for guidance “Decision trees for the selection of sterilisation methods” CPMP/QWP/054/98. As a 
result, the feasibility of terminal sterilisation was further investigated by the applicant with particular focus on 
the product stability, potency and impurity profile. Based on the results from this study and on a 
computational toxicology evaluation, a terminal sterilisation method was considered feasible, and was 
therefore implemented in the proposed manufacturing process. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A 10% overfilled is used in the manufacturing process and is considered justified to ensure target extractable 
volume of minimum 4 ml. 
The primary packaging is a colourless 5-ml type-1 glass vial closed with a butyl rubber stopper and a 
polypropylene flip-off cap. The materials of the components comply with Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 12/67 
  
  
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The manufacturing process consists of a sterile filtration of the compounded bulk formulation, aseptic filling 
into a pre-sterilized container closure system, followed by terminal sterilization using a validated steam 
sterilisation cycle (15 minutes at 121°C) in accordance with Ph. Eur. 5.1.1. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. Filtration and filling are defined as critical steps. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Three full scale 
batches were used to validate the manufacturing process up to the point of terminal sterilisation and two 
batches were used to validate the terminal sterilisation.  It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The release finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. It includes 
tests for colour (Ph. Eur.), appearance, volume (Ph. Eur.), subvisible particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), 
identification (HPLC and diode array), phenylephrine HCl assay (HPLC), ketorolac trometamol assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), container 
closure integrity (helium leak-vacuum mode) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guideline. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three full scale production batches, two clinical batches and three 
primary stability batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product  
Stability data of three production scale batches of finished product sterilised by filtration and stored under 
long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 °C / 75% RH) for 24 months  and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability data of two pilot scale batches of finished product terminally sterilised using a Ph. Eur. steam 
sterilisation cycle (15 minutes at 121°C) and stored under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH), intermediate (30 °C 
/ 75% RH) and accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, pH of solution, osmolality, subvisible 
particulate matter, sterility, container closure integrity, and bacterial endotoxin. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating. 
Stability results comply with the specifications. Based on the long term stability data of both aseptically 
manufactured and autoclaved finished product batches, the levels of impurities observed for autoclaved 
stability batches are not expected to exceed the shelf-life specification limit and it is expected that the 
stability of autoclaved batches will be similar to the stability of aseptically manufactured finished product 
batches.

EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 13/67 
  
  
In addition, one primary stability batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The study concluded that the drug product is subject to 
photodegradation and requires protection from light. 
The product is a concentrate so a dilution is required. Dilution should be performed immediately after opening 
so no stability data on the opened concentrate vial is required. 
In-use shelf-life after dilution was validated by compatibility studies with the proposed diluents: balanced salt 
solution (BSS) and balanced salt solution plus (BSS Plus).  Results showed that the diluted solution is 
chemically stable for up to 24 hours under ambient temperature and light and, for up to one hour in stainless 
steel reservoir and syringe administration aids under ambient temperature and light conditions. The following 
statement is included in the SmPC : “After dilution, chemical and physical in-use stability has been 
demonstrated for 6 hours at 25˚C. Use within 6 hours of dilution. From a microbiological point of view, the 
medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use are the responsibility of the user.” 
Based on available stability data and the applicant commitments to continue the stability studies on the two 
pilot scale batches of finished product terminally sterilised using Ph. Eur. steam sterilisation cycle (15 minutes 
at 121°C) and, to provide updated stability data,  as well as to immediately inform  competent authorities in 
case of any out-of-specifications results, the shelf-life of 18 months  and the storage conditions “Do not store 
above 25˚C. , Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. , Following dilution do not store 
above 25˚C” are acceptable and included in the SmPC . 
Adventitious agents  
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Since the product is intended to be used as 
irrigation solution during ocular surgery, sterility of the finished product was considered critical and the use of 
a sterilisation method providing the highest SAL possible was considered necessary. The originally proposed 
manufacturing process involved sterilising filtration and aseptic filling. However the CHMP considered that the 
choice of the sterilisation method was not in accordance with the Note for guidance “Decision trees for the 
selection of sterilisation methods” CPMP/QWP/054/98. As a result, the feasibility of terminal sterilisation was 
further investigated by the applicant with particular focus on the product stability, potency and impurity 
profile. Based on the results from this study and on a computational toxicology evaluation, a terminal 
sterilisation method was considered feasible, and was therefore implemented in the proposed manufacturing 
process. Based on available stability data and the applicant commitments to continue the stability studies on 
the two pilot scale batches of finished product terminally sterilised using Ph. Eur. steam sterilisation cycle (15 
minutes at 121°C) and, to provide updated stability data by the agreed timeframe, as well as to immediately 
inform the Competent Authorities in case of any out-of-specifications results, the shelf-life and the storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC are considered acceptable.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:  
The applicant should complete the stability studies on the two pilot scale batches of finished product sterilized 
by steam sterilisation cycle (15 minutes at 121°C) and submit updated stability data by the agreed 
timeframe. In addition, the applicant should immediately inform the Competent Authorities in case of any 
out-of-specification result. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme for Omidria was abridged and focused on the investigation of the 
systemic exposure and primary pharmacodynamics following administration during ILR surgery and the 
examination of the topical effects in toxicology testing.  
Both components have been on the market for several years and have well established profiles.  
Phenylephrine (PE) and ketorolac trometamol (KE) both have a long history of use as topical agents in 
ophthalmology and there is a significant body of literature on their individual clinical pharmacology. The 
applicant’s non-clinical program of studies in this application relied on the historical data as well as nonclinical 
studies conducted with Omidria. Four main nonclinical studies were conducted including a GLP study of 
Omidria in African green monkeys to evaluate safety and toxicity of the combination of PE and KE in irrigation 
solution. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics of Omidria was evaluated in three in vivo studies performed in African green 
monkeys undergoing ILR surgery that closely mimics the procedure that is performed in humans.  
Pharmacodynamic endpoints were also measured as part of the single dose GLP toxicity study.  The primary 
endpoints measured were the degree of mydriasis and flare count measured by laser photometry (a measure 
of anterior chamber inflammation) following the addition of PE and KE to the irrigation solution used during 
the surgical procedure. These studies resulted in rapid pupil dilation which exceeded that obtained by 
preoperative topical 1% tropicamide where the PE concentrations achieved were between 268 µM and 1165 
µM. KE alone had no effect on the induction of mydriasis.  KE alone reduced postoperative flare counts at 
concentrations between 10 and 30 µM. These studies provide evidence of efficacy for the use of PE and KE in 
combination.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not performed.  In view of the minimal and transient systemic 
exposure observed under treatment with Omidria, the risk of secondary pharmacodynamic effects is 
considered to be negligible.  This was accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
According to ICH S7A guideline ‘safety pharmacology studies may not be needed for locally applied agents 
(e.g., dermal or ocular) where the pharmacology of the test substance is well characterized, and where 
systemic exposure or distribution to other organs or tissues is demonstrated to be low’. As these conditions 
were met for Omidria, no safety pharmacology studies were conducted. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Based upon their known pharmacological properties, a pharmacodynamics drug interaction between PE and 
KE is not anticipated.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Systemic exposure of PE and KE was examined in African green monkeys following anterior chamber 
irrigation in two pharmacology studies (Study RX06.02 & Study RX07.03) and in one GLP single dose toxicity 
study (Study RX07.07).  The systemic exposure for both compounds was generally low and transient if 
measurable at all in the case of PE.  The highest plasma concentration of 14.9-38.3 ng/ml PE and 72.2-198.3 
ng/ml KE were measured in the high dose group (7200 µM PE and 900 µM KE) in the single dose GLP toxicity 
study (Study RX07.07) after immediate completion of the irrigation of the eye.   
No distribution, metabolism, excretion or other pharmacokinetic studies were conducted and their absence 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP as the systemic exposure to PE and KE observed following anterior 
chamber irrigation is minimal. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Administration of solutions containing PE and KE into the anterior chamber of the eye in African green 
monkeys showed no adverse treatment effects per se.  Higher flare values observed in the mid-dose group 
(2160 μM PE; 270 μM KE) were considered related to the greater degree of surgical trauma.  Flare values 
were comparable between all other groups, vehicle, low-dose (720 μM PE; 90 μM KE) and high-dose (7200 
μM PE; 900 μM KE).  AST elevations were considered related to surgical intervention and repeated ketamine 
sedation as they were found in both sexes in all treatment groups including vehicle group and returned to 
baseline by 11-14 days.  No test article-related gross abnormalities or histopathological findings were 
observed following necropsy in the tissues collected (heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, brain, eyes, and 
optic nerves) and other organs and tissues inspected.  Histopathological findings observed in the eye were 
consistent with lens replacement surgery.  The NOAEL was established at the highest dose tested (7200 μM 
PE; 900 μM KE). This represent a 6.2 safety margin of clinical PE exposure and a 4.2 safety margin of clinical 
KE exposure based on a maximum anticipated clinical dose of OMS302 diluted in 500 mL irrigation solution 
(480 μM PE; 89 μM KE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 16/67 
  
  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs), heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen partial pressure and rectal temperature were 
measured during the surgical procedure. There were no significant changes in intraoperative respiratory rate 
and oxygen partial pressure. Intraoperative heart rate and rectal temperature decreased in all groups. Since 
these effects were also observed in the control group, the drop in heart rate and body temperature was likely 
to be due to the surgery and anaesthesia. Cardiac rhythm was normal during surgery. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were not performed. 
Genotoxicity 
While  no  genotoxicity  studies  were  performed  with  OMS302,  data  presented  for  PE  and  KE  alone  shows  a 
very low genotoxic potential for both active ingredients. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed with Omidria as they are not required for a medicinal product 
intended for single use. The CHMP accepted this justification.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No repeat dose toxicity or reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted and their absence 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP given the low systemic exposure of Omidria.  Given the limited 
reproductive and developmental data, Omidria is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception and should not be used during breast-feeding.  These warnings 
have been adequately highlighted in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Study  RX07.07  was  GLP  compliant  toxicokinetic  study.  Five  out  of  48  measurements  had  non-zero  plasma 
level at baseline and an unacceptably high PE concentration was observed at 24h.  
Local Tolerance  
The  local  tolerance  of  OMS302  was  assessed  in  the  single-dose  toxicology  study  (Study  RX07.07).  There 
were no drug-related adverse local tolerance findings. 
Other toxicity studies 
An additional GLP-compliant rabbit ocular toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the effect on corneal 
endothelium. In this study Omidria was diluted in balanced salt solution to the diluted clinical concentration 
and administered by intracameral injection into one eye, and vehicle control was injected into the 
contralateral eye. In this study, eight female New Zealand White rabbits were evaluated by a board-certified 
veterinary ophthalmologist every four weeks during a 12-week post-dose observation period. At the end of 
the 12-week post-dose observation period, the ocular tissues were collected for microscopic evaluation by a 
board-certified veterinary pathologist. No treatment-related effects on the cornea were observed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The predicted environmental concentration in the surface water (PECsurfacewater) of PE and KE was 
calculated based on a dose of 49.5mg and 17 mg, respectively, to be below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. For 
this calculation, the Fpen was refined based on the estimated number cataract surgeries from a recent OECD

analysis evaluating data for European countries in 2010. Furthermore, PE and KE are not PBT (persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic) substances as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that 
Omidria was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical pharmacology studies show that use of Omidria results in rapid pupil dilation that exceeded that 
obtained by preoperative topical 1% tropicamide, where the PE concentration achieved concentrations 
between 268 M and 1165 M.  KE alone had no effect on the induction of mydriasis.  KE alone reduced 
postoperative flare at concentrations between 10 and 30 M, and a trend towards reduced flare was seen in 
study RX07.03 but did not reach statistical significance when KE and PE were added in combination 
(OMS302).  Conclusions on flare reduction and reduction on postoperative inflammation could not be made in 
study RX07.07 given the lack of concentration dependent effects.  The applicant considered that these 
findings possibly reflected greater surgery-associated trauma that occurred in the mid dose group, where no 
effects on flare measures were seen. 
These studies provide some evidence of efficacy for the use of PE and KE in combination and further enhance 
the well characterised pharmacological profiles of both the individual components within an ophthalmic 
setting. 
The absence of secondary and safety pharmacology studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP owing to 
the low and transient systemic exposure of PE and KE during irrigation with Omidria.  Furthermore, no 
adverse effects on vital functions were seen in the GLP single dose toxicity study. Pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions are not expected due to low and transient systemic exposure. 
The PK and TK results of were considered difficult to interpret given the insensitive nature of the PE analytical 
assay, the unexplainable and aberrant spurious observations (e.g. high concentrations at baseline) and lack 
of consensus of results between studies.  The reported pharmacokinetic concentrations fluctuated in a very 
wide range and did not show any reasonable pattern. The CHMP has requested the Applicant to discuss the 
probable causes of these errors. The applicant has provided results of a reanalysis of samples drawn in study 
RX07.06 and RX07.07 but the root cause of the high pharmacokinetic concentrations fluctuations observed in 
these studies have not been resolved. However, the lack of overt toxicities seen with within these studies 
alleviated the CHMP concerns surrounding PK anomalies.

Maximum plasma concentrations of PE observed in the pharmacokinetic studies performed with Omidria 
showed comparable exposures with other ophthalmological formulations. However when compared to oral 
formulations, it appeared that the systemic exposure of the low dose PE in monkeys (Study RX07.07) was 
approximately 5-fold and 4- fold higher than exposures observed in fed and fasted patients with a 10 mg oral 
dose. Following the CHMP request, the applicant discussed these results in more detail and provided IV data 
to qualify the low intraocular systemic exposures for PE. While the systemic concentration of PE appear to be 
higher in monkeys compared to exposure in fed and fasted patients with a 10 mg dose and with healthy 
volunteers administered a short IV infusion (albeit at the high dose only), this was found by the CHMP to not 
to be a cause for concern due to absence of overt toxicities seen in this single dose toxicity study.  
The CHMP also noted that Omidria is a fixed-dose combination product with well-known active substances. 
Therefore the requirements set by the Guideline on Clinical Development of Fixed Combination Medicinal 
Products (Doc. Ref. CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1) are applicable. This Guideline does not require per se carrying 
out toxicological studies provided that reasonable justification is given for waving safety concerns. The CHMP 
was of the opinion that there are no safety concerns in this regard because clinical studies confirmed that 
systematic absorption of the active substances is minimal. A comparison of the maximal plasma 
concentrations observed in non-clinical studies with levels determined in the clinical pharmacokinetic study 
demonstrated that the values in human subjects were considerably below those noted in monkeys at the 
NOAEL (7200 µM PE and 900 µM KE). The NOAEL represents a 6.2-fold multiple of clinical PE exposure and a 
4.2-fold multiple of clinical KE exposure based on a maximum anticipated clinical dose of OMS302 diluted in 
500 mL irrigation solution (480 µM PE; 89 µM KE). Relative to the concentrations of PE and KE in OMS302 for 
clinical use, the concentrations at the NOAEL represent 15-fold and 10-fold higher multiples for PE and KE, 
respectively. 
The absence of any overt adverse effects related to the test article at any dose in the single dose toxicity 
study supports the local safety and tolerability of Omidria.  Systemic exposure to PE and KE in the single-
dose toxicity study increased with increasing PE/KE concentrations in the irrigation solution, but was 
generally low and transient.  Based on this data, the CHMP considered risk of systemic side effects due to 
circulating PE and or KE levels to be negligible.  
The CHMP accepted the lack of any further toxicity studies because the intended clinical use of the drug 
product is limited to a single surgical intervention. Both active ingredients are well-known thus it was 
accepted by the CHMP that publicly available data was used to summarize the toxicological profile of both 
active ingredients. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered appropriate to support the proposed clinical use of Omidria.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
In the pharmacokinetic sub-study of Study OMS302-ILR-004, 1 of 14 patients had detectable PE: this patient 
(190063) was assigned to OMS302. The patient’s pre-treatment sample, immediately following instillation of 
topical PE pre-medication had a phenylephrine concentration of 1.7 ng/mL decreasing after Omidria 
administration to 1.3 ng/mL during the first two hours and undetectable at later time points. Since the 
highest PE concentration was observed prior to OMS302 administration, it presumably has been due to 
absorption of the preoperative PE 2.5% eye drops.  
For ketorolac (KE), 10 of 14 patients treated with Omidria and one of 12 patients treated with placebo had 
detectable levels in plasma. The placebo-treated patient had a single sample with detectable KE, with a 
concentration of 8.5 ng/mL at the 24-hour time point. One potential explanation for this result is that the 
patient may have received the postoperative KE eye drops the day after surgery prior to collection of the 24-
hour PK blood sample, contrary to the protocol. The same explanation could also account for 24-hour time 
point results in two Omidria-treated patients: Patient 18005 who had a concentration of 3.6 ng/mL and no 
detectable levels at any earlier time points, and Patient 179011 who had a concentration of 15.2 ng/mL, 
which was higher than all earlier time points (up to 4.2 ng/mL). Patient 179011 also had a pre-treatment KE 
concentration of 3.2 ng/mL, which was unexpected and may reflect recent KE use although the patient should 
not have been exposed to KE prior to surgery. Other than the two values of 8.5 and 15.2 ng/ml discussed 
earlier that are unlikely to be due to Omidria administration, the remaining concentrations of ketorolac in 
patients with detectable levels were low, in the 1-to-4 ng/mL range, and insufficient for PK analysis. 
Distribution and elimination  
As there is no or minimal systemic absorption, distribution and elimination have not been studied. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies were performed.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacology studies were conducted with Omidria since both phenylephrine and ketorolac are 
well-known active substance for which the mechanism of actions has already been well-described in the 
scientific literature. 
Mechanism of action 
The phenylephrine and ketorolac in Omidria act by distinct mechanisms, to maintain intraoperative mydriasis, 
to prevent intraoperative miosis, and to reduce acute postoperative pain. Phenylephrine is an α1-adrenergic 
receptor agonist and acts as a mydriatic agent by contracting the radial muscle of the iris, dilating the pupil 
with little or no cycloplegia. Vasoconstriction occurs in the conjunctival circulation and in other ocular vessels 
to the extent that they are exposed to drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 21/67 
  
  
 
Ketorolac is an NSAID that inhibits both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX1 and COX2), reducing pain and 
inflammation by decreasing tissue concentrations of prostaglandins resulting from surgical trauma. Ketorolac, 
by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis secondary to ocular surgical insult or direct mechanical stimulation of 
the iris, may also contribute to the prevention of surgically induced miosis. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No specific pharmacology studies were conducted with Omidria since both phenylephrine and ketorolac are  
well-known active substance for which the mechanism of actions has already been well-described in the 
scientific literature. 
When administered systemically, the cardiovascular pharmacology of PE is characterized by  increased blood 
pressure  secondary  to  increased  vascular  resistance,  and  a  concomitant  reflex  reduction  in  heart  rate 
(Hoffman, 2001). 
A  meta-analysis  of  nine  clinical  studies  indicated  that  increases  in  systolic  pressure  of  up  to  20  mmHg, 
increases  in  diastolic  pressure  of  up  to  15  mmHg;  and  decreases  in  heart  rate  of  up  to  10-15  beats  per 
minute (bpm) could occur at plasma levels of 10 ng/mL, but that the predicted changes in blood pressure and 
heart rate at plasma levels below 2 ng/mL was close to zero (FDA Briefing Document for the Cardiovascular 
and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee, 2012). 
The PD effects of topical ophthalmic PE were assessed by blood pressure monitoring in two studies.  In the 
first study (Kumar, 1985) of 24 patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery randomised to receive two drops of 
either 2.5% aqueous or 10% viscous ophthalmic solutions of PE, the maximal mean increase in systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) was 6 mmHg in the 2.5% solution group and 19 mmHg in the 10% solution group. The 
maximal mean increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 10 mmHg in the 2.5% solution group and 18 
mmHg in the 10% solution group; the difference between groups was not statistically significant. There was 
no correlation between the plasma PE level and change in blood pressure. 
In the second study (Kumar, 1986) 30 patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery were randomised to receive 
two drops of either 2.5% aqueous or 2.5% viscous ophthalmic solutions of PE. The hemodynamic results 
showed that mean SBP and DBP were increased by approximately 10 mmHg (range 8 to 13) compared to 
preoperative values at ten minutes after PE application in both treatment groups, and these values returned 
to near baseline by 30 minutes. There was no correlation between the plasma PE level and change in blood 
pressure in this study. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The systemic absorption of phenylephrine following administration of OMS302 is minimal to non-existent. 
Ketorolac does appear to be absorbed in detectable quantities. The CHMP was of the opinion that the 
applicant’s explanation for the unexpectedly high levels of ketorolac in two patients was plausible.  
The CHMP concluded that the data from patient 179011 were anomalous and the data from the patient with 
the next highest Cmax should be included instead in the SmPC section 5.2.  
Following a request from the CHMP, the applicant has provided a discussion of the effect of phaco fluid 
dynamic settings and phaco time on the exposure to PE and KE.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 22/67 
  
  
As only one subject had detectable PE plasma concentrations, there were not sufficient data to analyse the 
effect of phaco fluid dynamic settings or phaco time on the systemic exposure to PE. The effect of surgical 
variables on the systemic exposure to ketorolac was evaluated.  
Data on the fluid dynamic settings of the phacoemulsification machine were not collected. Therefore, the 
effect of the fluid dynamic settings on the exposure to KE cannot be analysed. However, data are available on 
the total volume of irrigation solution used during the procedure and the total duration of irrigation solution 
administration. The effect of both of these variables on systemic KE exposure was evaluated. The available 
data indicate a wide scatter between ketorolac exposure and volume of irrigation fluid, duration of irrigation, 
and phaecoemulsification time and no firm conclusions can be made on this basis.  
The CHMP noted that the published studies which compared the PK and hemodynamic effects of different 
formulations of PE were not designed to address the potential haemodynamic effects of PE since the 
difference in pre- and post-administration blood pressure may have been due to other factors, such as other 
medications or the surgical procedure. 
As this is a class effect of sympaticomimetics, a warning about elevations of blood pressure has been 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Further discussion of potential risks associated with systemically 
absorbed phenylephrine can be found in Discussion on clinical safety section of this report.  
The CHMP asked the Applicant to discuss the potential for PK and PD interaction with other topical 
medications used perioperatively.  
Both components of OMS302 (phenylephrine and ketorolac) have been used topically for decades in ILR 
surgery. Despite this widespread use drug interactions have not been reported between either PE or KE and 
any ophthalmological medications. Therefore the potential for unwanted pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic interactions between OMS302 and topical medications used perioperatively is small.  
It was also noted that OMS302 was used in the clinical trial programme as an addition to other medications 
used during eye surgery. Concomitant medications actually used on the eye on the day of surgery in the non-
clinical and clinical studies (in the OMS302 treatment group) included local anesthetics,  α1-adrenergic 
receptor agonists, anticholinergics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, glaucoma medication and antimicrobial agents 
and cholinergic miotic agents.  
The CHMP agreed that although unexpected drug-drug interactions are theoretically possible from the use of 
a novel combination they appear to be highly unlikely given the well-known nature of the active substances.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the view that the available information in the scientific literature as well the PK data 
collected in the clinical trials were sufficient to support the application for Omidria from a clinical 
pharmacology perspective. Given the local route of administration and that no significant systemic exposure 
was observed, the CHMP considered that the lack of specific pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic studies 
was acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has conducted four clinical studies in support of the authorisation of OMS302. Study CO9-001 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of OMS302 against vehicle and against PE alone and KE alone (in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 23/67 
  
  
compliance with the EMA/CHMP fixed combination regulatory guidance). Studies OMS302-ILR-003 and 
OMS302-ILR-004 were Phase III safety and efficacy comparisons to vehicle (placebo). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The optimal concentrations of PE and KE in the OMS302 irrigation solution were determined on the basis of 
nonclinical and clinical data. Three nonclinical studies evaluated the effect of PE on pupil diameter in African 
green monkeys. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) values were 7200 μM PE and 900 μM KE. The 
data concluded that the maximally effective PE concentration is at least 268 μM (Study RX07.06) and no 
more than 720 μM (Study RX07.07). 
The Phase 1/2 exploratory study C07-005 was a pilot study of Omidria without ocular pre-medication at 
concentrations of 714 μM PE and 89 μM KE. This did not give acceptable mydriasis and the study protocol 
was revised to provide ocular pre-medication and a less concentrated irrigation fluid of PE and KE of 483 μM 
and 60 μM, respectively. The amended protocol KE concentration of 60 μM was ineffective on ocular pain in 
the early postoperative period so 89 μM was used in the remainder of the clinical programme. 
Concentrations of PE above and below this have not been explored which is acceptable in view of the 
likelihood of a flat dose response curve and the invasive nature of the surgery required for the dose-response 
evaluation.

Eligible patients fulfilled the following principal inclusion criteria; were 18 years of age or older at the time of 
surgery, were to undergo unilateral primary CELR or RLE, under topical anaesthesia, with a coaxial 
phacoemulsification device with insertion of an acrylic lens, BCVA of 20/400 or better in the non-study eye, 
have an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 mm Hg and 22 mm Hg, in the study eye. For women of 
childbearing potential, have a negative urine pregnancy test and use a specified in the trial forms of 
contraception.  
The principal exclusion criteria were the presence of hypersensitivity (including cross-sensitivity) to relevant 
medications and the presence of significant ocular or general medical conditions.  
Treatments 
Omidria was supplied as a sterile, clear solution containing 60.75 mM phenylephrine HCl (12.37 mg/mL) and 
11.25 mM ketorolac tromethamine (4.24 mg/mL) formulated in a 20 mM sodium citrate buffer. Placebo was a 
sterile, clear solution containing 20 mM sodium citrate buffer.

phacoemulsification and intraocular lens replacement on intraoperative pupil diameter. 
Secondary: 
Evaluate  the  effect  of  OMS302  compared  to  placebo  when  administered  in  irrigation  solution  during 
phacoemulsification and intraocular lens replacement on: 
•  Pain during the early postoperative period as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
•  Postoperative  photophobia  as  measured  by  the  photophobia  subscale  of  the  Numerical  Rating  System 
(NRS) 
•  Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
•  Postoperative inflammation as measured by Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) 
•  Pain after the early postoperative period 
•  Safety as measured by adverse events (AEs). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: 
•  To  evaluate  the  effect  of  OMS302  compared  to  placebo  on  the  change  in  pupil  diameter  over  time  from 
surgical  baseline  to  the  end  of  surgery  when  administered  in  irrigation  solution  during  phacoemulsification 
and intraocular lens replacement. 
Secondary: 
•  Postoperative pain at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to 12 hours as measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
•  Postoperative photophobia as measured by the photophobia subscale of the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 
•  Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
•  Postoperative inflammation as measured by Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS)  at 24, 48 hours,  
and at seven and fourteen days. 
•  Pain after the early postoperative period (up to fourteen days). 
•  Safety as measured by adverse events (AEs). 
Sample size 
The sample size to support the ocular pain endpoint was 200 patients per treatment arm, based on a t-test at 
the 0.05 two-sided level of significance, a difference between the treatment arms [in VAS] of 5.0 mm with 
s.d. 13.3 mm, gave a 96% power to detect the treatment difference. The sample size to support the pupil 
diameter was based on a  t-test at a 0.05 two-sided level of significance an treatment difference of 0.6 mm 
Assessment report

with s.d. 0.7 mm; this gives > 99% power to detect the treatment difference. The mean treatment 
differences and standard deviations for the sample size were taken from Study C09-001. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to OMS302 or placebo; randomisation was stratified within site by Cataract 
Lens Opacities Classification System II.   
Blinding (masking) 
A masked central reader performed the pupil size measurements.  
To maintain masking, the bottles of irrigation solution were prepared by an unmasked pharmacist or 
designee who was not otherwise involved in the study. An unmasked pharmacy clinical research associate 
monitored the pharmacy. All other study personnel remained masked throughout the study. No subjects were 
unmasked during the study.  
Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 or later.  Study endpoints were summarised 
with descriptive statistics for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. 
All statistical tests were performed at the two-sided 5% significance level. All confidence intervals were 
constructed at the two-sided 95% confidence level. 
Analysis Populations 
Enrolled Population  All patients who completed the informed consent. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all 
randomised patients who received study medication. It was expected that all randomised patients were to be 
included in the FAS but, consistent with the intention-to-treat principle patients not starting treatment were 
excluded from the FAS.  
The Safety Population  All randomised patients who received study medication. Patients were grouped by the 
actual treatment received. Should a patient receive two or more different treatments, they were summarised 
within the treatment group for which they received the most treatment. 
Per-protocol population  All patients in the FAS population who had no significant protocol deviations that 
could complicate interpretation of the efficacy and/or safety. The analyses of the efficacy endpoints were 
based on the FAS population. All safety analyses were based on the SP. 
Sample size and analysis 
The sample size to support the ocular pain endpoint was 200 patients per treatment arm, based on a t-test at 
the 0.05 two-sided level of significance, a difference between the treatment arms [in VAS] of 5.0 mm with 
s.d. 13.3 mm, gave a 96% power to detect the treatment difference. The sample size to support the pupil 
diameter was based on a  t-test at a 0.05 two-sided level of significance an treatment difference of 0.6 mm 
with s.d. 0.7 mm; this gives > 99% power to detect the treatment difference. The mean treatment 
differences and standard deviations for the sample size were taken from Study C09-001. 
The mean change in pupil diameter during surgery was calculated as the area-under-the curve (AUC) divided 
by the surgery time minus the baseline for each patient. Summary statistics of the mean AUC of change from 
baseline was provided by stratum and treatment group. A generalised Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test 
stratified by the randomisation strata was used to compare the two treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 26/67 
  
  
Early postoperative ocular pain was measured on the day of operation by VAS at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to 12 
hours post-surgery. The mean ocular pain VAS was calculated as the AUC divided by the time during the first 
12 hours postoperatively. Summary statistics of the mean AUC was provided by stratum and treatment 
group. A generalized CMH test stratified by the randomisation strata was used to compare the two treatment 
groups. 
To maintain an overall type I error of 0.05 for the secondary endpoints, a step-down approach was used to 
evaluate statistical significance of the selected secondary endpoints. If the primary efficacy endpoint reached 
the 0.05 level of significance, the following secondary endpoints were tested sequentially at the 0.05 level:  
postoperative ocular pain VAS score at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-12 hours after ILR surgery, photophobia at 6 hours 
after surgery, photophobia at day 1, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at day 1, mean summed ocular 
information score (SOIS) at day 1, ocular Pain VAS score at day 1 
Results 
Participant flow 
All patients were to receive standardised preoperative antibiotic treatment (Vigamox® four times daily for 
three days prior to surgery), mydriatic treatment (one drop of PE 2.5% and one drop of tropicamide 1% at 
approximately 30, 15, and 5 minutes prior to surgery) and anaesthesia (topical lidocaine or tetracaine 
administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Postoperatively, all patients continued Vigamox® 
for seven days. All patients were discharged with paracetamol and instructed to contact their physician for 
pain not controlled by paracetamol. 
Study procedures were performed at screening, at baseline prior to surgery, the day of surgery 
intraoperatively, and postoperatively at approximately 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 to 12 hours, 24 
hours, 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. Daily diaries were to be completed once each morning during the first 
seven days. The length of time for patient participation was approximately two to six weeks: up to 28 days in 
the screening process and 14 days in the postoperative period 
Recruitment  
A total of 444 patients were screened of whom 405 were randomised. Thirty-nine patients were not 
randomised, primarily because of failure to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of patients 
randomised to placebo was 203 and to OMS302 was 202.  
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted from September 2011 to January 2012 at eighteen US investigative sites.  
On 17th January 2012 Protocol Amendment No 2 changed pain during the first 12 hours postoperatively from 
a co-primary efficacy measure to a secondary efficacy measure.

Numbers analysed 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints were based on the FAS, excluding subjects for whom pupil 
diameter data were not available. Safety analyses were based on the SP. Both of these analyses were based 
on randomized subjects starting study treatment. All subjects received the treatment to which they were 
randomized. 
The FAS consisted of all 402 subjects enrolled and randomized to treatment in this study who underwent 
surgery and received study drug. 
Three-hundred sixty-four subjects were included in the pupil diameter analyses. Video recordings of 38 
subjects were not readable or had incomplete identification so subject identity could not be determined. It is 
unlikely that the exclusion of these subjects could introduce a bias in a masked study. Also, multiple 
imputation analyses support the primary analysis of the study with this population. 
All 402 subjects in the FAS population provided at least one postoperative VAS pain score and were included 
in the ocular pain analyses. 
The PP population consisted of 332 subjects. This represents the FAS population after excluding 70 subjects 
because they had significant protocol deviations. 
The SP population consisted of 402 subjects; the three subjects who did not receive study treatment were 
excluded from this analysis set. All subjects received the assigned treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Pupil diameter 
Pupil diameter decreased throughout the surgical procedure in the placebo treatment group, but mydriasis 
was maintained in the OMS302 treatment group (Table 4 and Figure 1). Data and analysis for postoperative 
pain following surgery are shown in Table 5.

the 0.05 two-sided level of significance, a difference between the treatment arms [in VAS] of 5.0 mm with 
s.d. 13.3 mm, gave a 96% power to detect the treatment difference. The sample size to support the pupil 
diameter is on a  t-test at a 0.05 two-sided level of significance an treatment difference of 0.6 mm with s.d. 
0.7 mm; this gives > 99% power to detect the treatment difference. The mean treatment differences and 
standard deviations for the sample size were taken from Study C09-001. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to OMS302 or placebo. Randomisation to treatment group was stratified within 
site by cataract Lens Opacities Classification System II.  
Blinding (masking) 
A masked central reader performed the pupil size measurements.  
To maintain masking, the bottles of irrigation solution were prepared by an unmasked pharmacist or

baseline was provided by stratum and treatment group. A generalised Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test 
stratified by the randomisation strata was used to compare the two treatment groups. 
Early postoperative ocular pain was measured on the day of operation by VAS at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to 12 
hours post-surgery. The mean ocular pain VAS was calculated as the AUC divided by the time during the first 
12 hours postoperatively. Summary statistics of the mean AUC was provided by stratum and treatment

To maintain an overall type I error of 0.05 for the secondary endpoints, a step-down approach will be used to 
evaluate statistical significance of the selected secondary endpoints. If the primary efficacy endpoint reaches 
the 0.05 level of significance, the following secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially at the 0.05 level:  
postoperative ocular pain VAS score at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-12 hours after ILR surgery, photophobia at 6 hours 
after surgery, photophobia at day 1, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at day 1, mean summed ocular 
information score (SOIS) at day 1, ocular Pain VAS score at day 1 
Results 
Participant flow 
All patients were to receive standardised preoperative antibiotic treatment (Vigamox® four times daily for 
three days prior to surgery), mydriatic treatment (one drop of PE 2.5% and one drop of tropicamide 1% at 
approximately 30 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes prior to surgery), and anaesthesia (topical lidocaine or 
tetracaine administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Postoperatively, all patients continued 
the Vigamox® regimen for seven days. All patients were discharged with acetaminophen (paracetamol) and 
instructed to contact their physician for pain not controlled by acetaminophen (paracetamol). 
Study procedures were performed at screening, at baseline prior to surgery, the day of surgery 
intraoperatively, and postoperatively at approximately 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 to 12 hours, 24 
hours, 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. Daily diaries were to be completed once each morning during the first 
seven days. The length of time for patient participation was approximately two to six weeks: up to 28 days in 
the screening process and 14 days in the postoperative period. 
Recruitment 
A total of 451 patients were screened of whom 416 were randomised. Thirty-five patients were not 
randomised, primarily because of failure to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of patients 
randomised to placebo was 204 and to Omidria was 202.  
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted from April 2012 to January 2013 at fifteen investigative sites in US and one in 
Europe.  After Amendment 2.0, all patients received topical ophthalmic ketorolac on the first postoperative 
day. The dose was at the investigator’s discretion. All patients were to be treated with topical ketorolac for at 
least seven days.

Numbers analysed 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints were based on the full analysis set (FAS). Safety analyses were 
based on the safety population (SP). 
The FAS population consisted of 406 subjects who received study drug. Eleven subjects (seven in the 
OMS302 group and four in the placebo group) were not included in the analyses of intraoperative pupil 
diameter because data from the video recording were not available. Two subjects (both in the placebo group) 
were not included in the analyses of early postoperative pain because they did not provide VAS data on the 
day of surgery. 
The PP population consisted of 374 subjects; 32 subjects (16 subjects in each treatment group) were 
excluded from the FAS population because they had significant protocol deviations that could confound the 
interpretation of the results. 
The SP consisted of 406 subjects who received study drug. All subjects in the SP received the assigned 
treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The statistical analysis for pupil diameter is shown in Table 7 and the time course of intraoperative pupil 
diameter is in Figure 2.  Eleven patients were excluded from analysis as video recordings were incomplete, 
missing, or of poor technical quality.   
The analysis of postoperative pain is shown in Table 8 and Figure 3.

Notes 
CONCLUSIONS 
•  OMS302  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  on  the  co-primary  endpoint 
of maintenance of mydriasis. 
•  OMS302  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  on  the  co-primary  endpoint 
of reduction of ocular pain in the early postoperative period. 
•  OMS302  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  prevention  of  miosis 
defined  as  either  pupillary  constriction  ≥  2.5  mm  at  any  time  during  the 
procedure  or  as  absolute  pupil  diameter  <  6  mm  at  the  time  of  cortical 
clean-up or as < 6 mm at any time during the procedure. 
• OMS302 was statistically superior to placebo in the mean pupil diameter at 
the time of cortical clean-up. 
• No statistically significant treatment effect was observed on moderate-to-
severe pain in the early postoperative period (p = 0.08). Since a step-down 
approach was used to  evaluate  statistical  significance  of secondary efficacy 
endpoints, this meant that the remaining endpoints (ocularly pain free in the 
early  postoperative  period,  ocular  pain  on  Day  1,  photophobia  at  six  hours 
and  one  day  postoperatively,  SOIS,  and  BCVA)  did  not  achieve  statistical 
significance, even though  some of the endpoints had nominal p-values less 
than 0.05. 
•  All  sensitivity  analyses  were  consistent  with  OMS302  treatment  effects 
observed  in  the  FAS  population  on  both  intraoperative  pupil  diameter  and 
postoperative  ocular  pain.  These  sensitivity  analyses  included  per  protocol 
analyses,  multiple  imputation  analyses,  repeated  measures  analyses,  and 
analysis of intraoperative miosis. 
• Systemic exposure to PE and KE was low or undetectable at all timepoints. 
• OMS302 was well tolerated. 
•  More  placebo-treated  subjects  (70%)  than  OMS302-treated  subjects 
(58%)  reported  at  least  one  treatment-emergent  AE  (TEAE)  across  both 
treatment groups. 
•  The  most  frequently  observed  AEs  overall  were  eye  pain,  headache, 
posterior  capsule  opacification,  anterior  chamber  inflammation,  vision 
blurred,  ocular  discomfort,  conjuctival  hyperaemia,  photophobia,  and 
increased IOP, all anticipated events following ILR surgery. 
These  events  occurred  at  a  similar  incidence  across  the  treatment  groups 
with  the  exception  of  increased  intraocular  pressure.  The  adverse  event  of 
increased intraocular pressure  was reported  more frequently in the 
OMS302 treatment group than in the placebo treatment group. This 
finding has not been previously observed. 
• Adverse events were generally mild or moderate and not considered to be 
related to study treatment. 
• Four subjects (two in each treatment group) experienced SAEs that were 
not considered related to study drug. No deaths occurred in this study. 
• No subjects discontinued from the study because of an AE.

Analysis description 
Primary analysis: 
Mean area-under-the curve analysis 
Mean AUC was calculated as the area of the endpoint over time using the 
trapezoidal rule divided by the total time. Treatment comparisons were 
performed by a generalized CMH test stratified by the randomization strata. 
Sensitivity analysis: 
Repeated measures analysis 
Repeated  measures  model  included  the  treatment  group,  time-point,  and 
the  randomization  strata  as  covariates.  A  generalized  estimating  equation 
method  with  an  AR(1)  working-correlation  structure  was  used  to  estimate 
the model parameters. Treatment comparisons were based on least-squares 
mean difference between treatment groups. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant has not performed any efficacy meta-analyses. This approach was accepted by the CHMP as 
the two Phase III studies gave very consistent results. 
Additional prospectively defined analyses were performed on the pupil diameter measures. These analyses 
were the proportion of subjects who experienced an absolute pupil diameter less than 6 mm at any time 
during the surgical procedure and at the time of cortical clean-up, and the proportion of subjects who 
experienced pupil constriction of at least 2.5 mm during the surgical procedure.

Similar to pupil diameter, additional ocular pain analyses were prospectively defined to provide context to the 
findings of pain reduction.  These analyses were the proportion of subjects who reported no ocular pain 
(defined as VAS = 0 at each of the postoperative time points) and the proportion of subjects who reported 
moderate-to-severe ocular pain (defined as a VAS score ≥ 40 at one or more of the postoperative time 
points).

The use of analgesics on the day of surgery (other than ketorolac in subjects who received as a component of 
OMS302) was analysed in the Phase 3 clinical trials. All analgesics administered on the day of surgery were 
included. More placebo-treated subjects received an analgesic on the day of surgery than OMS302-treated 
subjects (34.7% of placebo-treated subjects and 24.6% of OMS302-treated subjects; p = 0.002 (Chi squared 
test)). Also, more pain was reported by placebo-treated subjects than by OMS302-treated subjects 
regardless of whether they used analgesics on the day of surgery (p < 0.001 in both subgroups). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The Applicant has not conducted any specific studies in special populations. This has been found acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
In Studies C09-001, OMS302-ILR-003, and OMS302-ILR-004, approximately 28% of subjects were younger 
than 65 years of age, approximately 45% were 65-75 years of age, and approximately 27% were older than 
75 years of age. The median age range was 23 years to 90 years with median 67 to 70 years. The majority 
of subjects were female. Approximately 80% of subjects were white, with most other patients being either 
black or Asian  
Elderly population was substantially represented in the studies, reflecting the onset of need for lens 
replacement therapy due to the nature of pathophysiology. 
Hepatic or renal impairment was not a selection point as the active ingredients are applied only once, for 15-
40 minutes and their absorption and systemic effect are negligible. 
Supportive study 
Study C09-001 was a Study of Phenylephrine HCl’s and Ketorolac Tromethamine’s Ability, Alone and in 
Combination, to Maintain Mydriasis and Relieve Pain and Inflammation in Patients Undergoing Unilateral 
Cataract Extraction with Lens Replacement. 
Methods 
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety of OMS302 compared to vehicle when 
administered during cataract extraction and lens replacement surgery (CELR) as measured by adverse 
events, evaluate the efficacy of OMS302 compared to vehicle on intraoperative mydriasis during CELR 
surgery as measured by intraoperative pupil diameter and to evaluate the efficacy of OMS302 compared to 
vehicle on ocular pain during the first 12 hours postoperatively. The remaining objectives were to evaluate 
the effect of OMS302 compared to ketorolac tromethamine (KE) on mydriasis during CELR surgery as 
measured by pupil diameter and to evaluate the effect of OMS302 compared to phenylephrine HCl (PE) on 
ocular pain during the first 12 hours postoperatively. 
The study was a randomised, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled evaluation of PE, KE, and 
OMS302 (the fixed combination) in patients undergoing CELR using a coaxial phacoemulsification process 
with insertion of an acrylic lens. The study evaluated, using a full-factorial design, the effects of OMS302 on 
intraoperative pupil diameter and ocular pain in the early postoperative period.  
Patients were randomised to one of the following four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 fashion: 
1.  Balanced salt solution (BSS) vehicle 
2.  Single study-drug formulation containing 483 μM PE 
3.  Single study-drug formulation containing 89 μM KE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 44/67 
  
  
4.  Combination study-drug formulation containing 483 μM PE/89 μM KE (OMS302). 
The study included two co-primary endpoints. The effect of OMS302 was compared to vehicle for the 
maintenance of mydriasis and for reduction in postoperative ocular pain.   
OMS302 was compared to KE for maintenance of mydriasis. (The contribution of PE to maintenance of 
mydriasis in the indication would be demonstrated if OMS302 was superior to KE on this endpoint. OMS302 
was compared to PE for reduction in postoperative ocular pain. (The contribution of KE to reduction in 
postoperative ocular pain would be demonstrated if OMS302 was superior to PE on this endpoint. 
Randomisation to treatment group was stratified by cataract Lens Opacities Classification System II (LOCS II) 
grade (N0 and NI, NII and NIII). 
Study Population  
For inclusion into the trial, patients were required to fulfil the following criteria within 28 days prior to the day 
of surgery: 
1.  Are 18 years of age or older at the time of surgery. 
2.  Are to undergo unilateral primary CELR, under topical anaesthesia, with a coaxial phacoemulsification 
device with insertion of an acrylic lens. 
3.  Have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/400 or better in the non-study eye. 
4.  Have an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 mm Hg and 22 mm Hg, inclusive.  
5.  For women of child bearing potential, have a negative urine pregnancy test. Women of child bearing 
potential were to use to use two methods of contraception throughout the study as necessary. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Any of the following was regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the trial: 
2.  Hypersensitivity to phenylephrine, ketoprofen or named medicinal products with potential cross 
sensitivity to phenylephrine and/or ketoprofen. 
3.  Women who are nursing a child or plan to nurse a child during the study. 
4.  Presence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, 
endocrine, neurological, psychiatric, respiratory or other medical condition as determined by the 
Investigator. Presence of any connective tissue disorder (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
fibromyalgia). 
6.  Presence of systolic blood pressure of ≥150 mmHg or ≤90 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of 
≥105 mmHg or ≤40 mmHg. 
Sample size 
The sample size required for the study was estimated at 192 patients (48 per treatment arm) based on the 
number of patients needed to demonstrate trends with respect to reduction of ocular pain on the day of 
operation taking into consideration results from a completed Phase 1/2 study in the same indication. In the 
completed Phase 1/2 study, the proportion of patients pain-free by 12 hours postoperatively in the treatment 
arm was 0.92 versus 0.67 in the vehicle arm. The assumed study parameters provide 90% power for a two 
sided t-test at a significance level of 0.05. To account for patients randomized but who do not qualify for

inclusion in the mydriasis and pain analysis set populations for primary efficacy analyses, a total of 200 
patients are anticipated to be randomized in the study. 
Results 
Disposition of patients and baseline characteristics 
A total of 264 patients were screened and 223 randomised at 23 study sites. All but one randomised patients 
received study treatment: Patient 20097 cancelled surgery before receiving treatment. Two patients received 
the incorrect treatment. Only one of the 222 patients who received study treatment discontinued from the 
study before completing all follow-up assessments.

ANOV comparison of OMS302 vs. other groups was not statistically significant at any time point to D 30 
Study C09-001 showed that for the primary endpoints; maintenance of mydriasis during surgery, and ocular 
pain for twelve hours after surgery, OMS302 was clearly superior to vehicle. For secondary endpoints (see 
Table 4) such as photophobia, visual acuity, and ocular inflammation no benefit over vehicle was observed 
and no claim was made in the SmPC on this basis 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design and conduct of the clinical studies was appropriate to show clinical advantages of adding OMS302 to 
the intracameral irrigation solution during lens replacement therapy. Inclusion criteria were acceptable. 
Overall, the CHMP agreed that studied populations were representative of majority of the target population 
with respect of demographic and other baseline characteristics. Study OMS302-ILR-004 randomized also 
patients 18 years of age or older at the time of surgery, however due to the nature of conditions the majority 
of the patients was >65 years old (Vehicle group 69.2% and OMS302 group 71.1%).  
Each of the studies in this application was conducted in the United States. One site in the Netherlands 
participated in study OMS302-ILR-004; this site randomized 12 subjects. The surgical procedure for ILR in 
Europe is identical to the surgical procedure in the United States, and there are no identified differences 
between patients in Europe and the United States in the aetiology or natural history of cataracts. Therefore, 
the CHMP agreed that population in the studies evaluating Omidria is considered to be representative of ILR 
patients in both Europe and the United States. 
Applicant’s claim that study populations represent target populations was only partially endorsed by the 
CHMP. Exclusion criteria seem to have been set to investigate study drug in basic, safe and uncomplicated 
circumstances so as to get interpretable results. The involved subjects did not represent those subgroups of 
patients who are expected to have substantial limitation in their mydriatic ability, namely those who suffer 
from connective tissue disorders, intraocular inflammation, prior iris trauma, presence of pseudoexfoliation in 
either eye or intraocular infection.   
The applicant provided a theoretical discussion as to why the product could still have a positive B/R ratio in 
excluded patients with connective tissue disorders and intraocular inflammation. Pharmacological agents can 
help maintain pupil dilation following surgical dissection, namely as the scarring can anchor the iris to the 
underlying anterior capsule and cause an anatomical barrier to pupil dilation. Similar effect is most probably 
true with prior iris trauma.

Neither phenylephrine nor ketorolac are contraindicated for use in these conditions and no specific safety 
concerns are noted in these patients for either agent. In fact, NSAIDs, including ketorolac, are used in the 
treatment of uveitis, either primary or caused by connective tissue diseases. Therefore, there is unlikely to be 
any added risk with the use of Omidria in these patients. 
Neither phenylephrine nor ketorolac should increase the risk of infection-related operative complications. 
Both components of OMS302, by maintaining pupil dilation throughout the surgical procedure, should make 
ILR easier and less traumatic in the setting of ocular infection, beneficially reducing the inflammatory 
response secondary to surgical trauma. In addition, it was also noted that ocular infection is a relative 
contraindication to ILR.  
This explanation was in principle accepted by the CHMP. However, as there was no clear evidence to support 
the efficacy or safety of Omidria in patients with a history of uveitis or iris trauma, the CHMP has not agreed 
that a positive benefit-risk balance can be assumed in these patients. Likewise in patients at risk of floppy iris 
syndrome due to alpha-adrenergic antagonist use, it cannot be assumed that Omidria will successfully 
maintain mydriasis. These considerations have been included in the SmPC. 
Study CO9-001 evaluated the safety and efficacy of OMS302 against vehicle and against PE alone and KE 
alone (in compliance with the EMA/CHMP fixed combination regulatory guidance).  The applicant’s approach 
to this guidance was unusual in that each single component was compared to the combination using an 
endpoint for which the single components are generally considered inactive.  For the endpoint of mydriasis 
OMS302 was compared to ketorolac – which has no mydriatic properties. Likewise for the endpoint ocular 
pain, OMS302 was compared to phenylephrine which has no known anti-inflammatory or analgesic 
properties.  Although the statistical methodology may be technically correct, the comparisons lead to a 
predictable result with no evident clinical or regulatory interpretation. A more appropriate analysis was 
requested by the CHMP. Specifically, OMS302 should be compared to PE for the endpoint pupil diameter 
during surgery and compared to KE for the endpoint postoperative ocular pain within twelve hours of surgery. 
The provided analysis suggested that for pupil diameter Omidria is equivalent to PE and for postoperative 
pain Omidria is equivalent to ketorolac. As there was no suggestion of inferiority of the combination to the 
single substances, the CHMP accepted this as a justification for the fixed dose combination.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary endpoints - maintenance of miosis during surgery and reduction of postoperative pain in the 
twelve hours post-surgery - Omidria showed clear and consistent benefit in two sizable and well conducted 
Phase III studies.  
The change in pupil diameter over time from surgical baseline was the primary pupil-related efficacy variable 
in each of the Phase 3 clinical trials. The primary analysis was based on the mean area-under-the-curve 
(AUC) pupil diameter change from baseline which is a standard methodology.  All subjects in each Phase 3 
trial received standard-of-care preoperative mydriatic (i.e., phenylephrine and cyclopentolate) topical drops. 
In the analysis in each trial, OMS302 was superior to placebo (p < 0.0001 in both studies).  In each trial, 
pupil diameter remained relatively stable in the OMS302-treatment groups while steadily decreasing in the 
placebo treatment groups. The variability observed at later time points during the surgery was related to the 
small number of subjects whose procedure had not been completed by those times. To provide context to the 
mean AUC analyses described above, additional prospectively defined analyses were performed on the pupil 
diameter measures. These analyses were the proportion of subjects who experienced an absolute pupil 
diameter less than 6 mm at any time during the surgical procedure and at the time of cortical clean-up, and 
the proportion of subjects who experienced pupil constriction of at least 2.5 mm during the surgical 
Assessment report

Page 50/67 
  
  
procedure. This is important because the pupil is the viewing portal onto the surgical field, and pupil 
constriction of 2.5 mm represents an approximately 50% decrease in the total pupil area.  This significantly 
increases the difficulty of the procedure and the risk of surgical complications. When a patient’s pupil is 
inadequately dilated, the full operative field is not visible and instruments must be used blindly.  Evidence 
from the published literature (Menapace, 2005) supports the contention that surgery is more difficult with 
increasing pupillary constriction and has a higher complication rate and that a papillary diameter of less than 
6 mm may act as a ‘marker’ for difficult surgery. 
Fewer than 10% of Omidria-treated subjects experienced a pupil diameter of less than 6 mm at any time 
during their surgical procedures. In contrast, more than 40% of placebo-treated subjects experienced pupil 
diameters of less than 6 mm despite receiving standard-of-care preoperative topical mydriatic drops. This 
demonstrates that more than four times as many subjects collectively in the placebo-treated group than in 
the Omidria group incurred the increased risk of vitreous loss associated with less than 6-mm pupil 
diameters. At the time of cortical clean-up, approximately 4% of Omidria-treated subjects had a pupil 
diameter less than 6 mm compared to 23% of placebo-treated subjects. This demonstrates that more than 
one in five placebo-treated subjects had small pupils limiting surgeon visualization of the capsular contents 
during cortical clean-up, making effective lens epithelial cell removal less likely and the risk of complications 
greater.  
The analysis of intra-operative pupil constriction of at least 2.5 mm also supports the clinical importance of 
the magnitude of the OMS302 treatment effect. More than 25% of placebo-treated subjects experienced this 
degree of pupil constriction during the surgical procedure compared to approximately 2% of OMS302-treated 
subjects. In these studies, a loss of 2.5 mm in diameter produces a loss in total pupil area of approximately 
50% based on the mean baseline pupil diameters.  
In the Phase 3 program, all subjects received standard-of-care pain management: preoperative anaesthetic 
drops topically and paracetamol, as needed, postoperatively. Ocular pain measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10-12 
hours postoperatively using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which was the principal secondary efficacy 
measure in Study OMS302-ILR-003 and a co-primary efficacy measure in Study OMS302-ILR-004. This 
duration of the pain assessment period was chosen because it approximates the waking duration of patients 
following ILR surgery. The primary analysis of the ocular pain VAS was based on the mean AUC. In each trial, 
OMS302 was superior to placebo in reduction of postoperative ocular pain over the initial 10-12 postoperative 
hours (p < 0.001 in both studies). The magnitude of pain reduction observed in the OMS302-treated groups 
was consistent over the 12-hour pain assessment period. Although the mean pain scores were relatively 
modest, in both studies the OMS302-treated subjects reported less than 50% of the pain reported by the 
placebo-treated subjects. Given that the pain measurements assessed ocular pain, the benefits provided by 
OMS302 in this Phase 3 program are clinically relevant. 
In addition, more placebo-treated subjects received an analgesic on the day of surgery than OMS302-treated 
subjects (34.7% of placebo-treated subjects and 24.6% of OMS302-treated subjects; p = 0.002 (Chi squared 
test)). Also, more pain was reported by placebo-treated subjects than by OMS302-treated subjects 
regardless of whether they used analgesics on the day of surgery (p < 0.001 in both subgroups). Similar to 
pupil diameter, mean AUC and additional ocular pain analyses were prospectively defined to provide context 
to the findings of pain reduction. These analyses were the proportion of subjects who reported no ocular pain 
(defined as VAS = 0 at each of the postoperative time points) and the proportion of subjects who reported 
moderate-to-severe ocular pain (defined as a VAS score ≥ 40 at one or more of the postoperative time 
points). These analyses are important because both surgeons and their patients have a low threshold for 
concern regarding ocular pain and expect ILRs to result in minimal postoperative pain. Similarly, most 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 51/67 
  
  
surgeons and their patients do not find acceptable significant postoperative ocular pain (moderate-to-severe 
pain) following ILR. 
The CHMP agreed with the Applicant’s argumentation that a pupil diameter of at least six millimetres is a 
target to facilitate surgery and was achieved by the great majority of patients. The difference in pain score 
and use of analgesics in the Omidria treated patients supports better pain control in the active treatment 
group. However, as there was no measurement of overall satisfaction with surgery of either the surgeon or 
the patient, the CHMP noted that the absolute clinical relevance is difficult to establish.  
The CHMP remarked that patients with diabetes may represent a particular efficacy and safety concern as the 
condition is common, predisposes to the need for cataract surgery, and wound healing is often considerably 
slower than in non-diabetic patients. This group of patients might develop also neuropathy by the time of 
development of cataract. The diabetic neuropathy might influence the innervation, thereby reactivity of the 
iris leading to difficulties to get necessary intraoperative mydriasis. The applicant was asked to provide the 
number of diabetic patients in the study populations and data on any difference in the efficacy and the safety 
measurements among them. 
The efficacy and safety of OMS302 between subjects with and without diabetes was compared in Studies 
C09-001, OMS302-ILR-003, and OMS302-ILR-004. Subjects with diabetes were identified by a medical 
history or use of concomitant medications used to treat diabetes mellitus.  The studies included 185 subjects 
with diabetes (slightly over 20% in the placebo group and slightly under 20% in the Omidria group). Forty-
two subjects were using insulin. This included 20 in the placebo groups and 22 in the OMS302 groups. 
Comparison of the mean AUC analysis of the change from baseline in pupil diameter in subjects with and 
without diabetes and the mean AUC analysis of the ocular pain VAS score was comparable between subjects 
with or without diabetes. Therefore, the presence of diabetes does not appear to impact the pupil diameter- 
or ocular pain-related efficacy of OMS302. The comparison of insulin using diabetics involves only small 
numbers but the analysis does not suggest any difference between safety and efficacy in those using insulin 
and those not using insulin. Therefore, CHMP agreed that no specific warnings are warranted for this 
population.  
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified the need for expert input and thus an ad-hoc expert 
meeting was convened on the following questions: 
Question 1.  
The experts are asked to provide information on the methods used in the current clinical practice 
if intraoperative mydriasis is not adequate. 
The experts noted that there are no medicinal products approved specifically for maintaining mydriasis and 
preventing miosis during cataract surgery. However, off label use of mydriatic agents (e.g. phenylephrine, 
adrenaline or tropicamide) either as intracameral bolus injection or by adding them to the irrigation solution 
is very common and supported by years of experience.  
In case pharmaceutical approach is not effective, mechanical methods such as pupil stretching, iris hooks or 
viscoelastics are used. These methods tend to carry higher risks of infection and iris damage. The choice of 
method is highly individual and depends on the surgeon’s estimation of relative risks of using these tools 
versus the risks of operating on a small pupil. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 52/67 
  
  
 
The experts reported that the clinical practices and methods used to maintain mydriasis can differ 
significantly between the hospitals, even within the same country or region.  
Question 2. 
In the experience of the experts, is use of ad-hoc (magisterial or hospital) preparations rare, 
occasional or common in current practice of ophthalmic surgery? 
The experts stated that use of ad-hoc hospital preparations is common in current practice. They are being 
prepared either by the hospital pharmacy or by a nurse in the operating theatre, depending on the site’s 
practice and facilities.  Intracameral cefuroxime and solution of adrenaline in infusion fluid were given as 
examples of such preparations.  
Question 3.  
In the experts’ experience, what percentage of patients needs additional (on demand) mydriatic 
medications during surgery? Is this possible to predict which patients are likely to fall in that 
group? 
The experts reported that approximately 25% of their patients need additional mydriatic intervention during 
surgery but it is not possible to confidently predict which patients will fall in that group. This is in line with the 
Chang et al 2014 publication. There are several known risk factors that increase the likelihood of progressive 
miosis; diabetes, glaucoma, use of alpha-blockers, uveitis, history of trauma etc.  However, pupil constriction 
can happen also in patients without any of the known risk factors.  
Question 4.  
The experts are asked to comment on the clinical relevance of effect of Omidria on maintenance of 
intraoperative mydriasis, prevention of intraoperative miosis, and post-operative analgesia. 
The experts were of the opinion that the efficacy of Omidria with regards to the effect on pupil size has been 
clearly demonstrated during clinical trials as Omidria was superior to placebo. However, the pivotal trials 
lacked direct comparison with the EU standard of care (off label use of mydriatic agents during surgery).  
With regards to the effect on pain scores, the experts observed that the clinical relevance of Omidria is rather 
modest. The experts noted that 95% of patients do not complain of pain after the surgery and the currently 
administered steroids and NSAIDs provide sufficient level of pain control. The experts also advised that every 
patient is assessed individually and the need for e.g. retrobulbar anaesthesia is decided on case-by-case 
basis.   
Question 5.  
In the experts’ view, to what extent is there potential added value of Omidria in the intraocular 
lens replacement surgery? Can you identify specific groups of patients who could especially 
benefit from the use of Omidria during the procedure? 
The expert group discussed the potential clinical utility of Omidria in the routine procedures and advised that, 
in their opinion, this product does not provide clear clinical added value over the current EU standard of care.  
The experts considered that a product available through a marketing authorization compared with current 
locally prepared solutions would offer superior guarantee of pharmaceutical quality and benefit:risk follow-up, 
all other things being equal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 53/67 
  
  
 
 
The experts observed that Omidria could potentially have an effect on intraoperative pain levels. However, 
this was not measured in any of the clinical studies.  
The experts debated the potential added value of Omidria in the group of patients mostly at risk of 
progressive miosis during surgery e.g. patients with pseudoexfoliation or iris abnormalities. One of the 
experts thought that patients with the history of uveitis could potentially benefit the most. However, these 
high risk patients were not included in the clinical trials conducted by the Applicant so it is not possible to 
state this categorically.  
The experts also expressed an opinion that there are certain groups of patients for whom Omidria would not 
be appropriate. For example, Omidria should not be used if cataract surgery is combined with vitrectomy, 
due to the vasoconstricting effects of phenylephrine. Same precaution may also apply to cases of vitreous 
loss arising as a complication of cataract surgery.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP concluded that the available data demonstrated a clinically relevant effect of Omidria on 
intraoperative mydriasis and acute postoperative ocular pain in intraocular lens replacement surgery. Thus, 
the available clinical evidence on efficacy was considered sufficient to support the Marketing Authorisation 
application. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the four controlled clinical studies conducted in the development program of Omidria, a total of 1,090 
patients received study-drug treatment (Omidria, PE, KE, or placebo/vehicle). In the integrated safety 
evaluation, patients who were treated with PE or KE alone were not analysed, leaving 960 patients in the 
safety analysis population, of whom 478 were treated with Omidria (with Study C07-005 using concentrations 
of PE and KE in test product that differed from the concentrations in Omidria proposed for commercial use) 
and 482 were treated with placebo/vehicle. Patients from studies C09-001, OMS302-ILR-003, and OMS302-
ILR-004 were pooled for safety analyses, with 459 having been treated with Omidria and 462 having been 
treated with placebo/vehicle. All studies enrolled adults undergoing ILR, primarily CELR, with less than 1% of 
patients undergoing RLE.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Six SAEs were reported, each occurring in an individual patient. The SAEs in the Omidria group were 
dehydration, electrocution, and myocardial infarction. The SAEs in the placebo group were malignant lung 
neoplasm, pleural effusion, and respiratory arrest. All SAEs were considered to be unrelated to study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
The analysis of laboratory findings including intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure did not show any 
safety concerns.  
Safety in special populations 
The safety of Omidria was prospectively evaluated with respect to gender, age, race, iris colour, and lens 
opacity for pooled studies. Safety measures evaluated by gender and age included AEs, vital signs, and IOP. 
Only AEs were evaluated by race, iris colour, and lens opacity since vital signs and IOP were not expected to 
be affected by these variables.  
For all age groups, the incidence of individual TEAEs summarized by PT was similar between the treatment 
groups and across age groups.  
The post hoc analysis of cardiovascular adverse events reported by patients with pre-existing hypertension or 
other cardiovascular disease was also conducted.  Blood pressure was reported as increased in 22 (4.8%) of 
placebo treated patients and 21 (4.6%) of the pooled Omidria patients. 
Omidria has not been studied in the paediatric population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no safety events due to drug interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One patient discontinued the study prematurely; he was fatally electrocuted in an industrial accident while 
still in the follow up period of the study. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety has been evaluated in four well conducted clinical studies, in three of them at the 
concentrations of PE and PK proposed for clinical use. The database was not large for a common surgical 
procedure. All three clinical trials gave very similar pictures in terms of safety profile.  The CHMP also noted 
that the adverse events relating to the eye are difficult to evaluate as most of them probably relate to the 
process of surgery rather than unwanted effects of phenylephrine or ketorolac.  
The existing dataset of over four hundred patients treated with Omidria and over four hundred control 
patients suggests that the product is safe.  Complications of surgery were infrequent and there was no 
suggestion that they were more frequent in the active treatment arm than the control arm. From the safety 
database all the treatment related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Assessment report

The CHMP noted that the effect of Omidria on the long term corneal and retinal health may not been 
sufficiently investigated due to the relatively small number of patients and short follow-up period. The 
potential risk of postoperative cystoid macular oedema (CMO) was also highlighted.  
In response to this question, the applicant provided an in-depth discussion of preclinical and clinical 
development. In the clinical trials for OMS302, corneal safety was evaluated by analysis of adverse events 
and best-corrected visual acuity (BVCA). Corneal adverse events and BCVA are relevant measures because 
injury to corneal endothelial cells is associated with corneal oedema and clouding, both of which impact 
vision. In the OMS302 safety database, corneal oedema was reported more frequently in placebo-treated 
subjects than in OMS302-treated subjects. Also, no consistent pattern of corneal oedema was apparent 
between treatment groups. 
Histological examination of corneal endothelium in toxicology studies together with analysis of clinical corneal 
adverse events and BCVA were deemed sufficient to detect clinically significant corneal endothelial injury. In 
these measures, no evidence of corneal endothelial injury associated with OMS302 was observed and no 
consistent OMS302-related treatment effect was observed on the cornea; therefore, the risk of damage to 
corneal endothelium was judged to be small. 
Cystoid macular oedema has many causes including cataract surgery, uveitis, sarcoidosis, retinal dystrophies, 
retinal vein occlusion, and choroidal nevi. The incidence of cataract surgery-related clinical CMO is 0.1-2.35%  
[Yonekawa, 2012] and CMO usually occurs 1-3 months postoperatively.  
The long-term safety of Omidria was evaluated in Study OMS302-ILR-004. In that study subjects were 
followed for 90 days postoperatively. One subject in the Omidria group reported cystoid macular oedema 
(CMO, mild severity) and one subject in the placebo group reported macular oedema (moderate severity).  
The incidence of each of these adverse events was 0.5%. This is near the lower end of the incidence range of 
clinical CMO reported in the literature of 0.1-2.35%. The reported incidence of angiographic CMO is 15-30% 
and CMO detected by optical coherence tomography is 4-11% [Yonekawa, 2012]. The Applicant also noted 
that ketorolac is a recognized treatment for CMO and the OMS302 clinical studies collectively do not 
demonstrate an increased risk of CMO associated with OMS302 treatment. Corneal disorders were reported 
by two subjects in the placebo treatment group (1.0%, both mild severity) and none in the OMS302 
treatment group. Corneal oedema was reported by seven subjects in the placebo treatment group (2.9%, six 
mild and one moderate severity) and four subjects in the OMS302 treatment group (1.5%, three mild and 
one moderate severity). One subject in the OMS302 reported mild corneal guttatae (Preferred Term of 
corneal degeneration). This was reported in both eyes and, thus, not considered related to study treatment. 
No other corneal adverse events were reported. 
The absence of toxicology findings related to the retina, the low incidence of CMO in the clinical studies 
relative to its literature-reported incidence, and the comparability of CMO incidence between the OMS302- 
and vehicle/placebo-treated groups demonstrate that the risk of CMO with use of OMS302 is low. 
CHMP concluded that the CMO does not appear to be a particular concern and the duration of clinical trials 
follow-up for what is a single short intervention seems acceptable. Nevertheless, as the data are limited and 
the follow up was shorter than suggested by the convened expert group, these risks cannot be excluded. 
Consequently, the corneal oedema was added as a Potential Identified Risks in the Risk Management Plan 
and lack of long-term data on corneal endothelial injury and influence on the incidence of cystoid macular 
oedema were added as missing information. 
The CHMP expressed a concern about the pro-hypertensive effects of phenylephrine which has been 
contraindicated for use in some authorised mydriatic products in the EU. However, the clinical data showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 57/67 
  
  
that OMS302 does not appear to have a hypertensive effect in the general population. The change from 
baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was evaluated separately in subjects with and without hypertension. 
This analysis demonstrated that the SBP changes from baseline are similar between OMS302 and placebo 
regardless of the presence or absence of hypertension. 
A review of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes from baseline in the placebo-controlled studies 
demonstrated variability in blood pressure changes throughout the surgical procedures.  The mean and 
median changes for the OMS302 treatment group were approximately zero and comparable to the changes 
observed for the placebo treatment group. The frequency of DBP greater than 105 mmHg was similar 
between treatment groups. Therefore, OMS302 did not have a hypertensive effect on DBP. 
Because Omidria did not appear to have a hypertensive effect in subjects either with or without hypertension 
and the systemic exposure of phenylephrine is very low the Applicant proposed that poorly controlled 
hypertension be included as a warning or precaution in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). This 
is consistent with a recently approved (2009) ophthalmic product that contains phenylephrine, Mydriasert. 
The CHMP agreed that the problem with sympathomimetics and eye surgery is not a sustained pro-
hypertensive effect as the levels are low and the exposure short, but rare, unexpected individual surges in 
blood pressure.   The Applicant’s proposal for the warning in the SmPC was found to be appropriate by the 
CHMP.  
An acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma can be triggered by certain drugs with the potential for causing 
dilation of the pupil, by anatomical changes in the ciliary body and iris, or, by movement of the iris-lens 
diaphragm.  As phenylephrine is a mydriatic agent, narrow-angle glaucoma has been included as 
contraindication in the SmPC of Omidria as a precautionary measure.  
The CHMP noted that administration of cefuroxime (1 mg in 0.1 ml injected in the anterior chamber at the 
end of surgery) is part of clinical practice for the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in a number of 
EU countries. As there is a significant exposure of phenylephrine and ketorolac in the anterior chamber at the 
time end of surgery, there may be a risk from the perspective of drug-drug interactions as well as local 
safety. The applicant was requested to present available data together with an in depth discussion of 
potential risks with the concomitant use of Omidria and intracameral cefuroxime. 
The administration of cefuroxime into the intracameral space at the end of surgery would be anticipated to 
mix with, and partially displace, any residual irrigation solution containing Omidria. Cefuroxime use should be 
compatible with the use of Omidria during cataract surgery because no pharmacological interactions are 
expected and these agents are physically compatible. No drug/drug interactions are reported with 
systemically administered alpha agonists or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Cefuroxime is not appreciably metabolised and is excreted by the kidney [Petri, 2011]. Neither PE nor KE will 
alter the metabolism of cefuroxime nor block its excretion. Cefuroxime is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor 
so, therefore, will not interfere with the metabolism of phenylephrine. Ketorolac is metabolized by 
hydroxylation [Mroszczak, 1990]. Cefuroxime will not interfere with this reaction. 
Given the distinct pharmacology for these three active ingredients and the lack of significant toxicity 
associated with neither of them, their combination is not expected to increase the risk of local toxicity. 
The CHMP agreed that in view of the lack of pharmacological interactions, absence of reports of clinical 
interactions, and the compatibility of Omidria with cefuroxime in a biologically relevant fluid, the risk of 
concomitant use of Omidria and cefuroxime is negligible.

In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified the need for expert input and thus an ad-hoc expert 
meeting was convened on the following question: 
Question 6.  
The experts are asked if the long-term safety is a potential concern for Omidria, particularly with 
regards to corneal endothelial cell health and the risk of cystoid macular oedema. If yes, what 
would be reasonable length of active follow-up after surgery? 
The expert panel agreed that the length of the follow-up in Phase 3 clinical trials was not sufficient to assess 
long-term safety and that the company should have considered performing an endothelial cell count during 
pre- and post-surgery visits. There is currently not enough data to exclude possible long-term effects on 
corneal endothelial cell health and the potential risk of cystoid macular oedema.  
The experts also noted that there is currently no data in public domain on the intracameral administration of 
ketorolac so it is not known if it may result in endothelial cell loss or not.  
The experts mentioned that cataract surgery can be sometimes combined with a corneal transplant. Due to 
the doubts on the effects on Omidria on the endothelial cell health, use of Omidria in that setting would not 
be advisable. There is also not enough reassurance to recommend the use of Omidria in patients with any 
coexisting endothelial cells impairments.  
As macular oedema can develop up to 6 months after surgery, the experts suggested that the expected 
duration of follow-up should be minimum 6 and ideally 12 months. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the available safety data were sufficient to support the application for 
Omidria. The CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Omidria was acceptable with the majority of adverse 
reactions being eye disorders and related to surgical procedure, while the risk of systemic exposure and 
adverse reactions was considered low. The safety profile was furthermore considered adequately reflected in 
the product information and all safety concerns were addressed in the RMP.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 03 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.  
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The beneficial effect of Omidria added to the irrigation solution used during lens replacement procedures has 
been demonstrated in the submitted studies.   
The results of the two Phase 3 Studies OMS302-ILR-003 and OMS302-ILR-004 provide robust evidence that 
Omidria maintains mydriasis as demonstrated by the mean change-from-baseline analysis in which the 
Omidria-treatment groups maintained the baseline pupil diameter throughout the procedure, while the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 63/67 
  
  
 
placebo group showed constriction of the pupil diameter with statistically significant differences between both 
groups observed in both studies. 
In addition, studies OMS302-ILR-003 and OMS302-ILR-004 showed significantly fewer subjects in the 
Omidria group than the placebo group who experienced intraoperative miosis defined as absolute pupil 
diameter less than 6 mm or as a at least 2.5 mm of pupil constriction during ILR.  
This effect of Omidria has been found clinically relevant by the CHMP as the intraoperative miosis significantly 
increases the difficulty of the ILR procedure and the risk of surgical complications. When a patient’s pupil is 
inadequately dilated, the full operative field is not visible and instruments must be used blindly.  Evidence 
from the published literature (Menapace, 2005) supports the contention that surgery is more difficult with 
increasing pupillary constriction and has a higher complication rate and that a pupillary diameter of less than 
6 mm may act as a ‘marker’ for difficult surgery. 
Omidria also reduced postoperative pain, which is mediated through the anti-inflammatory effect of 
ketorolac. The CMH weighted mean difference for postoperative pain (100-mm VAS) showed a significant 
difference between treatment groups. The categorical analyses of postoperative pain assessed the frequency 
of subjects with no ocular pain (VAS = 0) at all times and the frequency of subjects with moderate-to-severe 
pain (VAS ≥ 40) also showed significant differences between treatment groups. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Concentrations of phenylephrine and ketorolac above and below the concentrations used for Omidria have 
not been fully explored which is acceptable in view of the invasive nature of the surgery required for the 
dose-response evaluation. However, the applicant has selected a dose that was effective and well tolerated.  
As it is probable that the dose response curve for both active substances is flat, the proposed dose was 
accepted by the CHMP.  
The clinical trial protocols specified exclusion criteria for patients with conditions that could complicate the 
interpretation of the data such as connective tissue disorders and intraocular disorders. Consequently, the 
submitted studies did not include subgroups of patients who are expected to have substantial limitation in 
their mydriatic ability, e.g.  those who suffer from connective tissue disorders, intraocular inflammation, prior 
iris trauma, presence of pseudoexfoliation in either eye or intraocular infection.  
The clinical trials did not include any evaluation of the surgeons’ satisfaction with the procedure. Although it 
is acknowledged that there is no validated scale for such an evaluation, a simple scoring system could have 
been used.  Consequently, the benefit to the surgeon and patient in terms of added value over the current 
best clinical practice was not fully explored.  
Ocular lens replacement is typically a short procedure.  The great majority of patients in the submitted 
studies had their surgery completed within thirty minutes so the anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits of 
ketorolac are based on twenty to thirty minutes exposure. It is therefore to be expected that any analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory benefits will be predominantly peri-operative and this is generally what the results of 
the studies show. Benefits at times subsequent to the day of surgery have ceased to be measurable.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Omidria appears safe and well tolerated when used at low concentration in eye surgery. The most frequent 
adverse events observed in clinical trials were eye pain, anterior chamber inflammation, conjunctival 
hyperaemia, photophobia and corneal oedema.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 64/67 
  
  
The limited amount of systemic testing carried out by the applicant suggests that when used as 
recommended, systemic exposure to PE is below the level of detection in most patients and KE is present in 
detectable low concentrations for one to two hours post-surgery in most patients. The risk of systemic side 
effects has been assessed by the CHMP to be very low.  
The risk of an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma or the exacerbation of pre-existing narrow-angle 
glaucoma is established for phenylephrine. Therefore, use of Omidria has been contraindicated in patients 
with narrow-angle glaucoma.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety population was generally considered representative for the proposed target population of Omidria. 
There was some uncertainty regarding the long-term safety of Omidria, as there follow-up period after clinical 
trials was relatively short. However, overall, the CHMP considered the extent of exposure sufficient to support 
the application and the long term safety has been addressed as missing information in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
With the exception of eye pain (which was less frequent in Omidria group) the number and nature of adverse 
events in the active and vehicle group were quite similar. The CHMP also noted that the adverse events 
relating to the eye are difficult to evaluate as most of them probably relate to the process of surgery rather 
than unwanted effects of phenylephrine or ketorolac.  
The CHMP also noticed that it should be assumed that in some patients and/or when Omidria is not properly 
used, phenylephrine will be present in higher concentrations than in the submitted studies and may cause 
systemic side effects. It is recognized that α-adrenergic drugs can cause dangerous dysrthythmias when used 
in eye-surgery and an appropriate warning has been included in the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Maintenance of mydriasis and prevention of miosis are important since uncomplicated procedure helps ensure 
a successful operation, quick recovery, well-functioning new lens and an uncomplicated postoperative period.  
The large difference in the proportion of subjects who experienced miosis with a pupil diameter of < 6 mm in 
the vehicle/placebo groups compared to the active treatment groups is likely to represent a substantial 
decrease in surgical risk in the Omidria-treated subjects. The frequency of patients with a constriction of ≥ 
2.5 mm in pupil diameter confirms this result. 
Currently, the benefit to the surgeon in terms of facilitating his/her task and thus benefiting the patient in 
terms of better outcome was not directly measured. However, mydriasis was better maintained with Omidria 
than with vehicle alone which is expected to be beneficial. Omidria may also be particularly useful in case of 
longer surgeries, performed by less experienced or trainee surgeons 
With regards to the effect on pain scores, the convened expert panel observed that the clinical relevance of 
Omidria is rather modest. The experts noted that majority of patients do not complain of pain after the 
surgery and the currently administered steroids and NSAIDs are likely to provide sufficient level of pain 
control. Nevertheless, based on the clinical trial results, the CHMP was of the opinion that the observed effect 
on pain was still clinically relevant.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289528/2015 
Page 65/67 
  
  
The CHMP concluded that use of Omidria during lens replacement surgery may be of benefit to the patient 
and the procedure: both intraoperatively by leading to a better visibility and faster, more precise intervention 
by maintaining mydriasis, as well as post-operatively, by reducing early post-operative pain.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In light of the totality of the evidence and taking into account the experts’ view, the CHMP concluded that the 
benefits of Omidria outweighed its risks when used for maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis, prevention of 
intraoperative miosis and reduction of acute postoperative ocular pain in intraocular lens replacement 
surgery. Thus, the benefit-risk balance was considered to be favourable. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
So far, no medicinal products have been available for intracameral use to maintain preoperatively evoked 
mydriasis during cataract surgery. Off label use of IV formulations of mydriatic agents (e.g. phenylephrine, 
adrenaline or tropicamide) either as intracameral bolus injection or by adding them to the irrigation solution 
is very common. The convened expert group also noted that mechanical methods such as pupil stretching, 
iris hooks or viscoelastics tend to carry higher risks of infection and iris damage.  
Omidria has been developed, formulated and investigated for use in intracameral irrigation solution during 
lens replacement surgery for the purpose of maintaining mydriasis. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that it 
covers an unmet need.  
The effects of Omidria on intraoperative mydriasis and postoperative pain have been clearly demonstrated.  
As the global population is aging, lens replacement therapy will be more demanded and optimum 
intraoperative settings are needed.  
Omidria seems well tolerated and as it contains two well-known active substances, there are no unexpected 
findings in the safety database. 
As there was no clear evidence to support the efficacy or safety of Omidria in patients with a history of 
uveitis, iris trauma or patients using alpha-adrenergic antagonists, the CHMP could not establish that a 
positive benefit-risk balance can be assumed in these cases. This has been made clear in the SmPC. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the

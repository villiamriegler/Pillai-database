2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Nausea and vomiting are common complications of cancer chemotherapy. Patients consistently report 
that chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is an aspect of treatment they find most 
unpleasant and distressing. This syndrome has a significant impact on patients’ functional status and 
quality of life and patients may delay scheduled chemotherapy or even on occasion refuse potentially 
curative therapy because of CINV.  
Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors 
used for the prevention of CINV. Despite the demonstrated benefits of oral aprepitant, there is still a 
medical need for treatment options (such as intravenous administration) to prevent CINV in patients 
who cannot easily tolerate orally administered medication prior to initiating chemotherapy. Parenteral 
administration is also an important treatment option for oncologists for whom it is frequently more 
convenient and easier to administer compounds intravenously prior to the administration of 
chemotherapy (which is also commonly given intravenously). 
Fosaprepitant is a water soluble phosphoryl prodrug to aprepitant. Following intravenous 
administration, fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant in vivo via ubiquitous phosphatases. 
The pharmacologic activity of fosaprepitant is attributed to aprepitant.  
The 115 mg strength fosaprepitant formulation was licensed in 2008 as an intravenous alternative to 
aprepitant on Day 1. This line extension application refers to the use of a single dose of fosaprepitant 
of 150 mg as add-on to a corticosteroid and a 5-HT3 antagonist regimen as an alternative to the 3-day 
regimens for the indication of the prevention of CINV. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd has applied for a Line extension of marketing authorisation through the 
centralised procedure for a new higher strength (compared to the already approved 115 mg),  
Ivemend 150 mg powder for solution for infusion.  
The only difference between the 150 mg and the already approved 115 mg presentation is the amount 
of powder contained in the vial. The different strengths are filled from the same bulk. Consequently in 
most parts of the documentation reference is made to the documentation for the already approved 
lower strength.  
Concerning the active substance no new assessment has been performed. 
For the finished product, the information has been very similar to the assessment of the 115 mg 
strength of Ivemend and the differences between the 2 strengths have been highlighted. 
The  finished  product  is  packaged  in  a  glass  vial  containing  fosaprepitant  dimeglumine  equivalent  to 
150 mg fosaprepitant. 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 4/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The  active  substance  fosaprepitant  dimeglumine  is  the  water  soluble  pro-drug  of  already  approved 
water-insoluble  aprepitant  (already  marketed  as  a  centralised  product).  This  new  product  is  intended 
to  be  an  alternative  to  oral  administration  of  aprepitant,  to  facilitate  the  nausea  treatment. 
Fosaprepitant converts rapidly to aprepitant in vivo following intravenous administration. 
The structure of pro-drug fosaprepitant dimeglumine (INN) is detailed below. It is a white to off-white 
amorphous powder and is very hygroscopic. Properties such as solubility, partition coefficient and pKa 
have  been  described.  Fosaprepitant  has  3  chiral  centres  and  the  counter-ion  meglumine  4  chiral 
centres. 
Structure of fosaprepitant dimeglumine (pro-drug) 
Structure of aprepitant (drug) 
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture 
The synthesis of fosaprepitant can be summarised in 3 main steps starting from aprepitant, 
including phosphorylation, debenzylation and hydrogenation prior to precipitation and isolation of 
the active substance. 
The synthesis has been sufficiently detailed (materials, quantities, temperatures, pressures and 
typical yields given) including an adequate manufacturing process development. 
Satisfactory specifications are provided for all raw materials and starting materials used in the 
synthesis as well as control of the critical steps and intermediates.  
No process validation data has been submitted. However, a formal validation of the 
manufacturing process, at the proposed manufacturing site will take place prior to release of the 
product to the market. This was accepted. 
Impurities have been extensively discussed, and the level of the impurities (including residual 
solvents, catalysts and reagents) do not present any toxicological concern. 
The structure of fosaprepitant dimeglumine has been elucidated by analytical methods such as 
UV, IR, NMR (1H and 13C) and MS. Raw data with interpretations were provided. 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 5/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stereochemistry remains unchanged compared to the starting material aprepitant. The chiral 
centres of fosaprepitant are controlled in aprepitant as well as the chiral purity of the meglumine 
counter ion, and no epimerization is expected during the process. Also batch results have been 
consistent throughout the development and during storage.  
Adequate specification has been presented for fosaprepitant meglumine and includes parameters 
such as identification, appearance, assay, related substances, residual solvents, water content, 
heavy metals, counter ion meglumine. 
Analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. 
The specification has been justified and in particular the impurity limits. The acceptance criteria 
for impurities including residual solvents are in line with ICH requirements and batch results and 
do not raise any safety concern. 
Microbiological quality was not included in the specification. It has been appropriately justified 
taking into account the properties of fosaprepitant, the storage conditions and the manufacturing 
conditions of the finished product. Optical purity has not been included in the specification since 
it has been studied and remained stable during storage. 
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is stored in double polyethylene liners in stainless steel containers. 
Specification for the packaging material polyethylene has been provided and the material 
complies with EU Directive 2002/72/EC for use with pharmaceuticals. 
2.2.2.2. 
 Stability 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
Stability data were provided for three  commercial batches (36  months) of fosaprepitant stored in the 
commercial package at long-term (-20°C) and accelerated (5°C) conditions, in line with ICH conditions. 
The following parameters were investigated: appearance, degradation products, assay of fosaprepitant 
dimeglumine, water content. Analytical methods were described and validated. 
Based  on  the  data  provided  (testing  performed  according  to  the  established  drug  substance 
specification)  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  as  for  the  previous  submission  there  is  no  sign  of 
degradation. Data support a 3 years re-test period when the active substance is kept at -20°C. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
The product is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous 
infusion. Each 10-ml vial contains fosaprepitant dimeglumine (equivalent with 150 mg of fosaprepitant 
free acid) in a lyophilised matrix. 
The product is kept in 10 ml PhEur Type I glass vial with PhEur rubber stopper and aluminium seal with 
plastic cap. 
The difference between the 150 mg presentation as compared to the already approved 115 mg 
presentation is only the fill volume of the vial.

2.2.3.1. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
Concerning the development work reference is made to the assessment of the already approved 115 
mg strength.  
The  finished  product  is  a  powder  for  solution  for  infusion.  The  focus  of  the  development  has  been  to 
provide a parenteral product as an alternative to the oral hard capsule presentation of aprepitant. 
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is a phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant. Following i.v. administration the 
prodrug  rapidly  converts  to  aprepitant.  Aprepitant  is  insoluble  in  water  whereas  fosaprepitant 
dimeglumine is soluble. Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is an amorphous hygroscopic compound that easily 
degrades to “exclusively” aprepitant unless stored at low temperature. Degradation is enhanced by the 
presence  of  water.  Therefore  conditions  of  storage  at  low  temperature  and  reducing  the  exposure  to 
water have been carefully controlled to avoid conversion to aprepitant before use. 
The excipients were selected to provide a physically and chemically stable formulation. The formulation 
development  focused  on  the  following:  limiting  the  degradation  of  fosaprepitant,  preventing  of 
precipitation of aprepitant as well as of insoluble salts of fosaprepitant and optimising the lyophilisation 
process. Reducing the exposure of fosaprepitant to environmental water has been focused on. 
The following compendial excipients (PhEur) are commonly used for parenteral products and have been 
used  to  stabilise  the  formulation.  Edetate  disodium  prevents  precipitation  of  insoluble  salts  of 
fosaprepitant.  Polysorbate  80  is  added  to  solubilise  possibly  present  aprepitant.  The  level  of 
polysorbate  has  been  optimised  to  solubilise  aprepitant  but  is  below  a  level  raising  safety  concerns. 
Lactose is added to the formulation to prevent cake collapse. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid 
are used for pH adjustment. Water is used as solvent. 
Analytical methods are compendial and therefore no validation was needed. 
Certificates of analysis in compliance with PhEur have been presented for each excipient 
The manufacturing process development has been extensively discussed. Key steps in the manufacture 
are  compounding,  lyophilisation  and  stopper  drying.  The  process  has  been  optimised  to  prevent 
degradation of fosaprepitant during manufacture especially with regard to temperature, pH, and water 
content. 
Since  the  labile  nature  of  the  active  substance,  terminal  sterilisation  by  moist  heat  was  not  feasible. 
Gamma  radiation  did  also  cause  degradation  of  fosaprepitant.  Therefore  aseptic  processing  has  been 
the method of choice. 
Compatibility  between  the  finished  product  and  the  process  equipment  as  well  as  the  packaging 
materials  has  been  demonstrated.  Furthermore,  the  reconstituted  drug  product  has  been  tested  in 
medical  devices  used  for  reconstitution  and  administration  such  as  polyolefine  syringes,  hypodermic 
needles, IV sets, and cannulae. 
Compatibility between the finished products and diluents such as 0.9% Sodium chloride injection”, “5% 
Dextrose  injection”  and  “Water  for  injection”  has  been  confirmed.  The  product  is  stated  to  be 
incompatible with “Ringer’s” and “Lactated Ringer’s solutions. 
2.2.3.2. 
 Adventitious agents 
Among  the  excipients  only  lactose  is  from  animal  origin.  A  supplier’s  certificate  states  that  milk  is 
sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk used for human consumption. Therefore it 
complies  with  the  Note  for  guidance  EMEA/410/01  rev2  and  does  not  present  any  risk  of  TSE 
contamination.

2.2.3.3. 
 Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is the same as for the already approved 115 mg strength, only the fill 
volume differs. The key manufacturing steps that may impact product quality are compounding, 
lyophilization and stopper drying. Lyophilization and stopper drying remain unchanged from the 115mg 
product to the 150mg product. The compounding hold time specifications, process, and critical 
parameters also remain unchanged for the 150mg product although the manufacturing scale is slightly 
increased due to the increased fill volume.   
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in  detail  (equipment,  quantities,  temperatures, 
durations and in-process controls given). The manufacture consists of 11 steps: dissolution of inactive 
ingredients in water for injections (WFI), cooling, possible pH adjustment, addition of active substance, 
adjustment  of  batch  weight  with  WFI,  possible  pH  adjustment,  final  adjustment  of  batch  weight  with 
WFI, filtration through sterilising 0.22 micron filter, filtration into pre-sterilised vials, lyophilisation and 
capping. 
Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been applied during the manufacturing process 
including  temperature  control,  pH  check,  fill  weight  check,  pre-sterilisation  bioburden,  filter  integrity, 
control of lyophilisation parameters, and control of the stoppers. 
A 5% percent overfill has been included to assure the withdrawal of 150 mg fosaprepitant dimeglumine 
for reconstitution. 
The manufacturing process is not considered as a standard process, given the labile nature of the 
substance, the water-insoluble nature of the possible degradation product, the lyophilisation step and 
the aseptic processing. Validation data have been provided for the aseptic part of the process ensuring 
the sterility of the finished product and validation results submitted for 3 consecutive production 
batches. Results comply with the release specification and demonstrate the consistency and 
reproducibility of the manufacture. The validation applies to both the 115 and 150 mg presentations.  
Simulation of the aseptic process has been performed through media fill for both 150 and 115mg 
presentations. 
The  finished  product  is  supplied  in  type  I  borosilicate  glass  vials  closed  by  type  I  closures  (bromo  or 
chlorobutyl  rubber  stoppers)  capped  with  aluminium  seal  and  a  flip-off  plastic  cap.  Glass  vials  and 
stoppers have been adequately characterised and comply with PhEur requirements. 
2.2.3.4. 
 Product specification 
The 150 mg strength is merely an extension of the 115mg strength, since the 150 mg presentation 
uses the same bulk solution as the 115 mg presentation with the only difference being the amount of 
solution filled into each vial.  
Thus, the specifications for the 150 mg presentation are the same as those established previously for 
the approved 115 mg presentation.  The only difference in the specification for the 115 mg versus the 
150 mg presentation is that the acceptance criterion for “bacterial endotoxins” has been adjusted to 
account for the additional mass in the vial. 
The release and shelf life specification for IVEMEND 150 mg powder for solution for infusion have been 
provided and include parameters such as: appearance, identification (HPLC, NIR), pH, assay of 
fosaprepitant (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content 
(NIR, Karl Fischer), particulate matter, sterility, bacterial endotoxins. 
Non-compendial analytical procedures have been adequately described and validated. 
Analysis of five pilot scale batches kept in the commercial packaging has showed that all batches 
remain within the proposed specification.

The  finished  product  is  supplied  in  type  I  borosilicate  glass  vials  closed  by  type  I  closures  (bromo  or 
chlorobutyl  rubber  stoppers)  capped  with  aluminium  seal  and  a  flip-off  plastic  cap.  Glass  vials  and 
stoppers have been adequately characterised and comply with PhEur requirements. 
2.2.3.5.  Stability of the product 
Stability Summary and Conclusion 
Stability data for the 150 mg presentation was already provided in the dossier for the 115 mg 
presentation as supportive data. 
In the present submission data from the formal stability studies in terms of  up to 24 months of  long-
term data at 5°C/ambient humidity (one batch of 24 months and four batches of  9 months) and 
6 months accelerated data at 25°C/60%RH   from the formal Stability Studies. The batches are of 
commercial scale and have been manufactured with the current process.   
Testing is performed according to the proposed specification and in addition reconstitution time is 
checked. 
Post-approval Stability Protocol and Stability Commitment 
The post-approval stability program is accounted for in general words, where it is stated that the 
program will continue and that stability studies will be carried out for validation batches and/or early 
commercial batches (validation batches) and that additional batches will be placed on the program 
each year. 
Stability data 
From data provided it may be concluded that at long-term storage condition there is no significant 
degradation as judged by assay values and the level of aprepitant. At accelerated condition there is an 
acceptable increase in aprepitant level. The product is stable for 24 months when stored refrigerated 
(2-8°C).  
Statistical analyses are provided. Comparisons are made to the 115 mg presentation.  
Based on the stability data, the shelf-life when stored under the conditions detailed in the SPC can be 
supported. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The product in this application is a line extension, a new higher strength 150 mg as compared to the 
already approved 115 mg strength.  
Active substance 
Generally, satisfactory documentation has been provided. The active substance fosaprepitant (prodrug 
of  aprepitant)  is  well  characterised  and  the  retained  specification  including  the  impurities  levels  have 
been justified by toxicological studies. Stability data support the proposed re-test period providing that 
it is kept at -20C. 
Drug Product 
The only difference between the 150 mg and the already approved 115 mg presentation is the amount 
of powder contained in the vial. The different strengths are filled from the same bulk.  
Even though the provided stability data as well as data submitted for the 115 mg presentation gave 
assurance of the stability of the product, additional stability data collected since the submission of the 
application, were requested. Accordingly, updated stability data have been provided for the five 
batches that were included in the original submission. 24 months data from long term storage at 
5°C/ambient humidity are available for one batch and 12 months for the other four batches. There is 
no sign of degradation. The product is stable for 24 months when stored refrigerated (2-8°C).

In  summary,  the  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described  and  controlled.  It  should  ensure  a 
consistent  quality  for  the  product.  Appropriate  specification  has  been  selected  for  this  parenteral 
product.  Stability  studies  under  ICH  conditions  have  demonstrated  the  good  stability  of  the  finished 
product. Stability data support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC as 
well as stability after reconstitution. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this medicinal product Ivemend 150 mg powder for solution form infusion is considered 
satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in the SPC. This product is a line extension from the 
existing  Ivemend  115  mg  powder  for  solution  for  infusion,  the  only  difference  between  the  two 
products is the fill volume of the vial.  
The  documentation  provided  for  the  active  substance  fosaprepitant  (prodrug  of  aprepitant)  is 
comprehensive and well detailed. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  is  adequate  for  this  intravenous  formulation  and  took  into 
consideration properties such as hygroscopicity and thermal lability of the active substance. 
The excipients are those typically used for parenteral formulation. Similarly, the packaging material is 
well documented and no incompatibility has been noticed. 
The  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  ensures  consistency  and  reproducibility  of  the  finished 
product. 
The  finished  product  has  been  satisfactorily  controlled  and  stability  studies  conducted  under  ICH 
conditions showed that the product is stable throughout the proposed shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical evaluation focused on the relevance of the previous toxicity studies conducted with 
aprepitant/fosaprepitant for the exposure with the increased dose of fosaprepitant. No new non-clinical 
pharmacology or pharmacokinetic data were submitted for fosaprepitant.  
The potential of the excipient polysorbate 80 to interfere with P-glycoprotein was evaluated separately. 
An environmental risk assessment was furthermore requested for this application. 
In addition, the results of an animal study on local tolerability were submitted with this application 
which was a follow-up measure (FUM) to the initial marketing authorisation of Ivemend 115 mg. A 
statement of compliance with GLP was provided for this study (TT#08-7590).  
2.3.2.  Toxicology 
The applicant,stated that the full toxicity profiles of fosaprepitant or aprepitant have not been 
investigated due to limited exposure multiples. For aprepitant, significant exposure multiples (Cmax and 
AUC) have been reached only in one species (dog, sufficient exposure margin to target organs of 
prostate, testis, ovaries, thymus). In the low-exposed rats, receiving aprepitant for 5 weeks, target 
organs were liver and thyroid together with changes in clinical chemistry and hematology. For 
fosaprepitant, no multiples to AUC and only borderline multiples to Cmax (dog/monkey) have been 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 10/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
investigated. The predominant toxicity observed following IV administered fosaprepitant was injection 
site reactions. The option to further increase exposure was not investigated in the different species, i.e. 
a second species for aprepitant and two species for fosaprepitant.  
Local tolerance 
The MAH has provided the results of a single-dose local tolerability study in rabbits (TT#08-7590) 
which was a follow-up measure of the initial marketing authorisation of Ivemend 115 mg. The potential 
risk for injection site reactions following accidental mis-administration of fosaprepitant was evaluated 
following single intravenous, intramuscular, paravenous, and subcutaneous doses to female and male 
New Zealand White rabbits. A total of 40 New Zealand White rabbits (20 females, 20 males) received 
0.5 ml of a commercial formulation of fosaprepitant (1 mg/ml) either as an intravenous, intramuscular, 
paravenous or subcutaneous bolus injection in specific locations on the left side of the animals. Placebo 
control formulation was given by the same routes of administration on the animals’ right side. 
At interim necropsy on study day 2, the incidence and/or severity of histomorphologic changes 
observed at all fosaprepitant-treated injection sites were increased compared to placebo control. Initial 
acute inflammation was reported in the majority of animals independent of the route of administration 
(day 2). For certain routes of administration, very slight to moderate subacute inflammation (PV, IM) 
and very slight to moderate muscle degeneration and necrosis (IM) were evident at study termination 
(final necropsy on study day 8). How these reactions developed beyond day 8 was not followed, i.e. 
whether they resolved or further progressed were thus not investigated. 
2.3.3.  Other non-clinical studies 
The MAH has evaluated the potential of the excipient polysorbate 80 to interfere with P-glycoprotein. 
Polysorbate 80 (PS80) is a component of the fosaprepitant formulation for intravenous administration. 
The potential of PS80 to act as an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was assessed in vitro in LLC-PK1 
cell monolayers that stably express a human MDR1 cDNA; verapamil and quinidine were used as 
marker P-gp substrates. PS80 was found to be a weak inhibitor of human MDR1-mediated verapamil 
and quinidine transport, with apparent IC50 values of 66 ± 8 and 200 ± 30 μM, respectively. Under the 
conditions of these experiments, cyclosporin A (10 μM) nearly completely inhibited the P-gp-mediated 
transport of verapamil and quinidine. The fosaprepitant 150 mg formulation contains approximately 
78 g of PS80. Thus, an injection of this product into the bloodstream over a minute would result in 
78 mg of PS80 distributing into approximately 5 liters of blood. This, in turn, would result in a peak 
PS80 concentration in blood of approximately 16 μg/ml or 12 μM (assuming a molecular weight for 
PS80 of 1,310 Da); this peak concentration would be expected to be much lower if the product is 
infused over a period of 15 min. Since the IC50 values for PS80 for the inhibition of P-gp mediated 
transport are considerably higher than the anticipated peak concentrations, it was considered unlikely 
that the amounts of PS80 in the fosaprepitant product will result in significant inhibition of P-gp in vivo. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
 The applicant has responded on the question raised in the primary assessment. A second question has 
now been raised. This is proposed to be solved as a Follow up measure.  
The applicant provided an updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) for the current line extension 
application of the product Ivemend. 
The applicant`s approach to conduct the ERA with the active substance aprepitant is supported 
because fosaprepitant is a pro-drug.  
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 11/37 
 
  
 
 
A value for the n- octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow 4.8) is included in the updated ERA. The 
value exceeds the action limit (log Kow  >4.5) for a step- wise screening procedure on persistence, 
bioaccumulation an toxicity according to the requirements of guideline on Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). But the value cannot 
be validated yet. Therefore the applicant is asked to submit the study report for the determination of 
the logKow. If the value of 4.8 is considered to be valid the applicant will be asked to provide a step- 
wise screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.    
The applicant included two approaches for the calculation of PECsurfacewater (PECsw) in the updated 
ERA. 
The first approach is based on number of treated patients in the EU within 6 years (data submitted in 
module 1.8.2). From the data for the 6 years period it is acceptable to calculate the number of patients 
treated within one year. The number of patients is acceptable for an refinement of marketing 
penetration factor Fpen in Phase I of the ERA.  
Moreover the applicant included treatment cycles into the PEC calculation resulting in a value for 
PECsurfacewater of 3.75x10-5 µg/L. This approach is not acceptable because the consideration of 
treatment cycles is not acceptable for a refinement of PECsw in Phase I assessment. 
If only the number of treated patients is taken into consideration for calculation of PECsurfacewater will 
be 0.0135µg/L. This value exceeds the trigger value and therefore a Phase II assessment has to be 
provided. 
The second approach for calculation of PECsurfacewater is based on sales forecast data. This is not 
acceptable for a refinement in Phase I assessment. It can only be taken into consideration in a Phase II 
assessment for further refinement of PECsurfacewater. 
For a Phase II fate and effect assessment the applicant has only provided endpoints of aquatic effect 
studies in the updated ERA (Attachment A). This is not sufficient. The endpoint data cannot be 
validated and can therefore not be used for risk assessment. The applicant is asked to provide a Phase 
II fate and effect assessment on aprepitant according to the requirements of guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  This also includes the study reports on the aquatic effect studies cited in 
Attachment A of the environmental risk assessment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Apart from the local tolerance study, no new non-clinical data have been provided with this application 
as extensive non-clinical studies were conducted to support registration of fosaprepitant 115 mg. In 
the non-clinical overview submitted with this application the MAH justified the relevance of the 
previous toxicity studies conducted with aprepitant/fosaprepitant for the exposure with an increased 
dose of fosaprepitant. Appropriate information such as the low exposure in animals limiting the value 
of the toxicity studies is given in the SPC 4.6 and 5.3. This was acceptable for the CHMP. 
The results of the local tolerance study in rabbits demonstrate the potential risks associated with 
accidental mis-administration of fosaprepitant. The medical care professionals administering 
fosaprepitant should be aware of the undue local reactions reported in the rabbits of ‘mis-administered’ 
Ivemend. Therefore, a warning statement has been added in the SmPC section 4.4, and appropriate 
wording has been included in section 5.3.  
Fosaprepitant 150 mg dose contains 78 mg PS80 (115 mg dose contains 60.4 mg PS80). The CHMP 
concurred with the MAH’s conclusion this amount is unlikely to result in significant inhibition of P-gp in 
vivo and is below a level raising safety concerns.  
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 12/37 
 
  
 
 
A question regarding the company’s approach for the ERA has been raised as an other concern and 
should be addressed as a follow up measure. 
In conclusion, the proposed single fosaprepitant 150 mg dose to replace the three-day regimen with 
(fos)aprepitant, does not raise concerns from a nonclinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The already approved fosaprepitant 115 mg strength was licensed as an intravenous alternative to oral 
aprepitant 125 mg to be taken on day 1 prior to start of the chemotherapy treatment. The present line 
extension refers to the use of a single dose of fosaprepitant 150 mg as add-on to a corticosteroid and a 
5-HT3 antagonist regimen as an alternative to the 3-day regimens. The underlying rationale is that the 
fosaprepitant 150 mg regimen will provide comparable efficacy and safety profiles as the 3-day oral 
aprepitant regimen evaluated in previous highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC, 
MEC) trials. 
In support of this application, the MAH submitted the results of a Phase 3 non-inferiority trial between 
the single-dose fosaprepitant 150 mg regimen and the approved 3-day oral aprepitant regimen 
(P017L1). Furthermore, an open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of a single 150 mg IV dose 
of fosaprepitant (MK-0517) on the pharmacokinetics of oral dexamethasone and oral midazolam has 
been provided (P018L1). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following intravenous administration, fosaprepitant is rapidly (within 30 minutes) converted to 
aprepitant. The aprepitant pharmacokinetic profile after a single 150 mg fosaprepitant infusion and the 
CINV 3-day aprepitant 125/80/80 mg treatment regimen has been evaluated by means of a cross-
study comparison. 
Aprepitant is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3-
day antiemetic regimen for CINV (125/80/80 mg). The involvement of CYP3A4 in the oxidative 
metabolism of dexamethasone in human liver microsomes is well established. Systemic exposure to 
aprepitant has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 following single-dose administration of aprepitant and of 
fosaprepitant. In previous studies, this led to dose-dependent increases in midazolam or 
dexamethasone exposures, as each of these compounds are substrates for CYP3A4. With this 
application an interaction study evaluating the influence of fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose on 
dexamethasone exposure Days 1, 2 and 3 and midazolam exposure Days 1 and 4 after fosaprepitant 
administration was submitted (study P018L1).  
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics profile of aprepitant 
The MAH has provided a cross-study comparison of the aprepitant pharmacokinetic profile after a 
single 150 mg fosaprepitant infusion (study P165) and the CINV 3-day aprepitant 125/80/80 mg

both regimens is shown in Figure 1.

Time (hr)
Figure 1.  Mean aprepitant plasma concentrations (ng/ml) versus time from single-dose 
intravenous (IV) 150 mg fosaprepitant and from oral aprepitant 125/80/80 mg regimen. 
[Note: The above plot for the oral 125/80/80 mg aprepitant regimen does not show 
Day 2 (24 to 48 hrs) because aprepitant exposure was not measured at that time.] 
Aprepitant exposure is higher during the first 4 hours after administration of fosaprepitant 150 mg 
than after administration of aprepitant 125 mg orally, with about 2.5 to 3-fold higher Cmax. The 
concentration-time profiles are thereafter similar until the second dose of the aprepitant CINV regimen 
is administered, where after the aprepitant concentrations are lower for the fosaprepitant single-dose 
regimen. 
Special populations 
The applicant justified the absence of specific studies in special population (hepatic insufficiency and 
renal insufficiency) by stating that the studies previously conducted within the oral aprepitant 
development program adequately cover the use of 150 mg fosaprepitant in these populations given 
that the aprepitant exposure is comparable. The effect of intrinsic factors on aprepitant 
pharmacokinetics is expected to be similar for the fosaprepitant 150 mg dose and the aprepitant CINV 
regimen. Hence, the lack of studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of fosaprepitant in special 
populations was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

P018L1: An Open-Label, 2-Part, Randomized, 2-Period, Crossover, Single-Center Study to Evaluate the 
Effect of a Single 150-mg Intravenous Dose of Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine (MK-0517) on the 
Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dexamethasone in Part 1, and on the Pharmacokinetics of Oral Midazolam in 
Part 2, in Healthy Young Adult Subjects

Methods 
Study Design 
This was an open-label, 2-part, randomized, 2-period, crossover, single-center study consisting of 4 
study drug treatments (A and B in Part 1; C and D in Part 2): 
Treatment A:   A single 8 mg oral daily dose of dexamethasone alone on Days 1, 2, and 3. 
Treatment B: 
A single 8 mg oral daily dose of dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, and 3 co-
administered with a single 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant 
dimeglumine infused over 30 minutes on Day 1. 
Treatment C:   A single 2 mg oral daily dose of midazolam alone on Days 1 and 4.  
Treatment D:   A single 2 mg oral daily dose of midazolam on Days 1 and 4 co-administered 
with a single 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant dimeglumine infused 
over 30 minutes on Day 1. 
Populations Studies 
Twelve healthy young adult subjects were planned to participate in Part 1 and 10 subjects in Part B of 
the study. Each subject participated in only Part 1 (Dexamethasone Interaction) or Part 2 (Midazolam 
Interaction) of the study. There was a washout of at least 14 days between each treatment period. 
Subjects were administered study drug in the fasted state. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To evaluate the effect of a single 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant on CYP3A4 activity in 
healthy subjects as measured by the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone and midazolam, 
respectively, following oral administration. 
Secondary: 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single 8 mg oral daily dose of dexamethasone and single 
2 mg oral daily dose of midazolam, respectively, co-administered with a single 150 mg IV dose of 
fosaprepitant infused over 30 minutes. 
Analytical Methods 
Plasma samples collected following administration of dexamethasone in both treatment periods in 
Part 1 of the study were analyzed for dexamethasone concentrations. The analytical method involved 
liquid-liquid extraction for analyte isolation followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography 
coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Satisfactory accuracy and precision was shown for 
lower limit of quantification, low, medium and high QC sample concentrations. Linearity was 
demonstrated within the calibration range 0.500 to 500 ng/ml. Dilution integrity was demonstrated. 
Stability in plasma was demonstrated for 307 days at -20°C, exceeding the duration of sample 
storage. 
Plasma samples collected following administration of midazolam in both treatment periods in Part 2 of 
the study were analyzed for midazolam concentrations. The analytical method involved liquid-liquid 
extraction for analyte isolation followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometric detection. Satisfactory accuracy and precision was shown for lower limit of 
EMA/559664/2010

quantification, low, medium and high QC sample concentrations. Linearity was demonstrated within the 
calibration range 0.100 to 100 ng/ml. Stability in plasma was demonstrated for 364 days at -20°C, 
exceeding the duration of sample storage. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-24hr and Cmax for oral dexamethasone and oral midazolam were 
obtained by non-compartmental methods. 
Statistical methods 
The effect of a single dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant on the dexamethasone and midazolam 
pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24hr and Cmax) was evaluated using a linear mixed effects model 
appropriate for a 2-period, crossover design with fixed effects terms of sequence, period, day, 
treatment and treatment by day interaction and a random effect term of subject within sequence. Log 
transformation on AUC0-24hr and Cmax was applied. A two-sided 90% confidence interval for the true 
mean difference in AUC0-24hr in the log scale was calculated. These confidence limits were then 
exponentiated to obtain a confidence interval for the true geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC0-24hr. 
Cmax was analyzed in a similar fashion. Summary statistics (minimum, maximum, and median) were 
provided for Tmax. Harmonic mean and pseudo standard deviation were provided for apparent terminal 
t1/2. 
Results 
Twenty-three (23) subjects (10 males and 3 females in Part 1; 6 males and 4 females in Part 2) were 
enrolled into the study. Of these 21 completed the study as planned (11 subjects in Part 1; 10 subjects 
in Part 2) while 2 subjects (AN 0002 and AN 0003) discontinued the study prematurely. Female subject 
AN 0002 withdrew consent and discontinued from Part 1 of the study for personal reasons. Male 
subject AN 0003 was discontinued from Part 1 of the study due to serious clinical adverse experiences 
(pneumonia and pulmonary embolism) which were considered unrelated to the study drug by the 
investigator.

† Geometric mean computed from a linear mixed-effects model performed on the natural-log 
transformed values. 
Dexametasone AUC was increased by 101, 86 and 18% on Days 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The 
corresponding Cmax values were 24, 31 and 18%. Dexamethasone half-life was prolonged from 3.6 and 
3.0 h for dexamethasone alone to 5.7 and 4.0 h, respectively, on days 1 and 2 after administration 
with fosaprepitant.  
Midazolam AUC increased by 77% and Cmax by 17% on Day 1. There was no effect on midazolam AUC 
or Cmax on Day 4. Midazolam half-life was prolonged from 4.6 for midazolam alone to 6.2 h on day 1 
after administration with fosaprepitant.  
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Given the intravenous administration (avoiding inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4) and the shorter 
duration of administration, a lower CYP3A4 inhibitory potential for fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose 
than for the aprepitant 3-day CINV regimen was expected. This was explored in the interaction study 
P018L1 which demonstrated an overall somewhat lower effect of fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose on 
orally administered CYP3A4 substrates than the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen. The effect on Day 1 is 
fairly similar for the two regimens, however, the inhibitory effect by fosaprepitant 150 mg is of a 
shorter duration. The effect of fosaprepitant 150 mg on dexamethasone Day 1 (101% increase) was 
similar to that observed for aprepitant 125 mg (120% increase). For midazolam, the effect of 
fosaprepitant 150 mg on day 1 (77% increase) was somewhat smaller than that for aprepitant 125 mg 
(130% increase). 
The dexamethasone data showed that an inhibitory effect is maintained on Day 2 (86% increase), but 
has essentially disappeared on Day 3 (18% increase). No effect on midazolam was seen on Day 4.

Page 17/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
These data support the proposed dexamethasone dose on Days 1 and 2 (about 50% reduction) and 
the unchanged dose on Days 3 and 4. 
Based on the conducted midazolam interaction study, the applicant suggested that the midazolam 
Day 4 data support the conclusion that a single fosaprepitant 150 mg dose does not have a clinically 
relevant inducing effect on CYP3A4. In response to questions raised during the assessment, the 
applicant discussed if there is a risk for clinically relevant induction of CYP3A4 at later time points than 
Day 4. The data suggest that 150 mg fosaprepitant should result in similar or less induction than for 
the aprepitant 125/80/80 mg CINV regimen and this has been reflected appropriately in section 4.5 of 
the SPC.  
Because of the pharmacokinetic findings within Part 1 of the study, the dexamethasone oral dosing 
regimen in fosaprepitant Protocol 017 (P017L1) in the fosaprepitant 150 mg arm of the study was 
established as 12 mg q.d. on Day 1, 8 mg q.d. on Day 2, and 8 mg b.i.d. (i.e., every 12 hours) on 
Days 3 and 4, i.e. a dose reduction by 50% on days 1 and 2 and the normal dose on days 3 and 4, as 
compared to the oral aprepitant arm wherein the dexamethasone oral dosing regimen was established 
as 12 mg q.d. on Day 1 and 8 mg q.d. on Days 2 to 4, where the dexamethasone dose is reduced by 
50% days 1-4. 
The CYP3A4 inhibition caused by oral aprepitant is a mixture of inhibition of intestinal and hepatic 
CYP3A4, while the CYP3A4 inhibition caused by fosaprepitant can be attributed to hepatic CYP3A4 
inhibition alone. In the response to questions, the applicant has discussed the available data on 
inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4 of aprepitant and fosaprepitant. The effect of aprepitant 125 mg on 
hepatic CYP3A4 was evaluated after administration of intravenously administered midazolam, and 
resulted in an increase in midazolam AUC of about 50%. The effect of fosaprepitant on IV midazolam 
has not been evaluated. The effect of fosaprepitant 150 mg on oral midazolam is larger (77%) than 
that of aprepitant on IV midazolam. This may be explained by an effect also on the first pass 
metabolism of orally administered midazolam. The effect on midazolam half-life for fosaprepitant and 
aprepitant was similar (about 27% increase) suggesting a similar effect on hepatic CYP3A4. 
There are no data on CYP2C9 substrates but a single fosaprepitant 150 mg dose is expected to cause 
no greater induction of CYP2C9 or glucuronidation than the aprepitant 125/80/80 mg CINV regimen 
and the absence of data was therefore acceptable for the CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.3.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The 150 mg fosaprepitant dose was selected based on pharmacokinetic data from previously 
conducted studies investigating the pharmacokinetics of various doses and administration regimens for 
IV fosaprepitant and the aprepitant-NK1 receptor occupancy relationship established for aprepitant 
after oral administration. Based on observed plasma aprepitant levels obtained on Days 2-4 following a 
single 15 or 30 minute infusion of fosaprepitant, CNS NK1 receptor occupancy levels were predicted to 
remain greater than 90% through at least Day 3 following a single 150 mg IV fosaprepitant dose 
administered over 20-30 minutes and greater than or equal to approximately 80% through at least 
Day 4. Protocol P017L1 was, therefore, designed to test the hypothesis that receptor occupancy levels 
of this degree would be sufficient to confer similar (i.e., non-inferior) clinical efficacy compared to the 
approved 3-day oral regimen.

aprepitant (125 mg PO on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2 and 3) in 
combination with ondansetron (32 mg IV on Day 1) and dexamethasone 
(12 mg on Day 1, 8 mg on Days 2 and 3, and 4). 
Objectives 
The aim of the study was to investigate whether a single “high dose” of fosaprepitant IV is non-inferior 
to the licensed, oral aprepitant regimen administered over 3 days as add-on to a high-dosed 5-HT3 
antagonist based standard regimen. 
Outcomes/endpoints

1.  Complete Response - Overall (no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy in the 120 hours 
following initiation of cisplatin). 
2.  Infusion-site reactions (thrombophlebitis, severe pain, severe erythema, severe induration)

1.  Complete Response - Delayed Phase (no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy 25 to 120 
hours following initiation of cisplatin). 
2.  No Vomiting - Overall (in the 120 hours following initiation of cisplatin). 
In addition, the study evaluated a number of exploratory endpoints, e.g. 
  Complete Respone – Acute (0 to 24 hours following initiation of cisplatin) 
  No Impact on Daily Life (FLIE total score >108) – Overall 
 
Time to first vomiting/retching episode- Overall (0 to 120 hours following initiation of 
cisplatin); 
  Complete Protection – Overall (no vomiting, no use of rescue therapy and maximum 
nausea VAS <25 mm; evaluated 0 to 120 hours following initiation of cisplatin)) 
Sample size 
It was estimated that to address the primary hypothesis, a total of 2,292 patients will need to be 
enrolled to yield approximately 2,226 evaluable patients. It was anticipated that 1,113 evaluable 
patients per regimen, assuming a 2-sided 5% significance level for testing the primary efficacy 
hypothesis and an expected response rate of 67.7% in each treatment regimen, would yield 90% 
power to declare non-inferiority for the single-dose fosaprepitant dimeglumine regimen, using a non-
inferiority margin of 7 percentage points.  
The sample size calculation considered a planned futility analysis which is accompanied by a slight loss 
of power. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients who met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to treatment based on a computer 
generated allocation schedule. 
Blinding (masking) 
Investigators, study nurses and patients remained blinded to the study medication. An allocation 
schedule and blinded supplies were provided by the sponsor. Open-label fosaprepitant vials were 
supplied to an unblinded pharmacist or designee who prepared the IV infusion bags containing 
fosaprepitant or normal saline solution. Full details of the procedure for the unblinded pharmacist were 
contained in a separate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Unblinding envelopes were provided for 
emergency unblinding in case of serious adverse experiences or medical emergencies when knowledge 
of the treatment group for a given patient may be necessary. 
Statistical methods 
The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was -7%. The two pivotal registration studies for aprepitant, 
studies P051 and P054, were used to define this margin. 
All efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) patient population. The FAS population 
included patients who received at least one dose of study therapy, received cisplatin chemotherapy, 
and had at least one post-treatment efficacy assessment. The Per Protocol (PP) patient population 
excluded patients with important deviations from the protocol that might have substantially affected 
the results of the efficacy analyses.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 2,322 patients randomized, 2,247 were included in the FAS (3.2% exclusion from total 
randomized population). Thirty-seven patients of the aprepitant regimen and 38 patients on the 
fosaprepitant regimen were excluded. Reasons for exclusion included patients not receiving study drug, 
patients not having a post-baseline efficacy assessment or patients not receiving cisplatin 
chemotherapy. Of the 2,247 patients included in the FAS population 2,203 (2.0% exclusion from FAS) 
patients were included in the PP population. The reasons for exclusion included violation of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients not receiving highly emetogentic chemotherapy level cisplatin, 
patients taking prohibited medication or patients not taking all required study medication.

Exploratory endpoints 
The FLIE is a self-administered, validated emesis- and nausea-specific questionnaire. Patients 
completed the questionnaire 5 days after receiving chemotherapy (Day 6). The questionnaire had 9 
questions (items) on nausea (nausea domain) and 9 questions on vomiting (vomiting domain). No 
impact of CINV on daily life was defined as an average item score of >6 on the 7-point scale (i.e., 
>108 total score or >54 domain score). 
The percent of patients with no impact of CINV on daily life by treatment group is summarized below.

2.5.  Discussion & Conclusion on Clinical Efficacy 
The selected experimental and control regimens of study P017L1 were considered justified, the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered adequate and the outcome measures are standard, 
sufficiently sensitive and adequate for a non-inferiority study. And while the primary efficacy measure 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 24/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
could be criticized for not focusing on the delayed phase, altogether the overall design and the selected 
chemotherapy regimens and the (fos)aprepitant regimens were considered appropriate by CHMP. 
With respect to gender and age, the patient population is considered representative for patients 
undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy (NSCLC). From a non-inferiority perspective more women 
and more patients below 55 years of age would have been preferable, but it is acknowledged that with 
respect to these covariates the population is similar to the patients enrolled in the pivotal trials in the 
aprepitant aplication. 
Aprepitant was the first (2003) NK1 receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of CINV 
(chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting). Pivotal for licensure were two add-on studies to 
standard of care where an oral three-day regimen in both studies showed an add-on activity with 
respect to complete response of about 20%. In the pooled analysis the lower 95% CI for add-on 
activity was 14%.  
The pivotal study for this application (P017L1) was conducted in a study population similar to the 
pivotal aprepitant studies, the chemotherapy regimens were similarly cisplatin-based and the study is 
considered to be of high quality with respect to planning and conduct and thus suitable as a single, 
pivotal non-inferiority study. 
Of note chemotherapy regimens of moderate or high emetogenicity (per Hesketh Classification) were 
not allowed during the 6 days following cisplatin infusion. This, however, was the case also in the 
pivotal aprepitant studies 
In the FAS, as well as the Per Protocol patient population, the pre-defined non-inferiority objective was 
met and the “possible” difference of about 4% is considered clinically insignificant. Also with respect to 
secondary outcome measures, including those focusing on control of nausea and emesis during the 
delayed phase of CINV, the objective of showing non-inferiority is considered fulfilled. The time to first 
vomiting event plots also support a non-inferiority conclusion. 
No non-inferiority margin was predefined with respect to FLIE and “no impact of CINV on daily life”, 
but the observed outcome may be compared with the pooled outcome in pivotal studies (P052 and 
P054). Also with respect to this outcome measure, it appears reasonable to conclude that overall non-
inferiority has been shown, even though trends towards worse results in the vomiting specific domain 
have been noted. 
2.5.1.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety of the multiple day aprepitant regimens were evaluated in approximately 6,500 
individuals participating in clinical trials. In addition, fosaprepitant 115 mg IV infused over 15 minutes 
has been approved as an alternative for 125 mg oral aprepitant on Day 1 of the 3-day aprepitant 
regimen. Pivotal for the assessment of safety for this application (the 150 mg strength) is however the 
randomized comparative study P017LI. 
Patient exposure 
In Study P017L1, a total of 2,322 patients were randomized to receive either the fosaprepitant 
regimen (fosaprepitant, ondansetron, dexamethasone) (n=1,147) or the aprepitant regimen 
(aprepitant, ondansetron, dexamethasone) (n=1,175). Four patients in the fosaprepitant group and six 
patients in the aprepitant group did not take study medication and were excluded from the AE 
population. 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 25/37 
 
  
 
 
As (fos)aprepitant were used as add-on to a high-dosed ondansetrone standard regimen in the context 
of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, it is hard to disentangle events causally related to (fos)aprepitant 
therapy.

Infusion-site reactions (Primary safety endpoint) 
Potential concerns for safety and tolerability that may be unique to fosaprepitant intravenous 
formulation as compared to oral aprepitant include reactions at the injection site. Therefore, reactions 
at the injection site were prespecified events of clinical interest for P017L1 to test the hypothesis that 
the single-dose fosaprepitant dimeglumine regimen is well tolerated in the first cycle of cisplatin-based 
HEC.

†Calculated using method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Every patient is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event. A patient with multiple adverse 
events within a system organ class is counted a single time for that system organ class. 
A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the 
columns is greater than or equal to the percent incidence specified in the report title, after rounding. 
All cases were classified as non-serious. Out of the 9 cases of thrombophlebitis, five were characterized 
as moderate in severity. According to investigator assessment 5 out of the 9 cases of thrombophlebitis 
were related to chemotherapy and eight out of 9 cases recovered or resolved. The remaining patient 
was characterized as resolving, but the adverse event did not completely resolve by the time of the 
study completion. This patient’s adverse event was characterized as mild and the adverse event was 
characterized as being related to both the administration of cisplatin and study medication by the 
investigator. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Post-marketing safety reports received by the MAH indicate a possible relationship between 
hypersensitivity reactions in patients administered fosaprepitant 115 mg.  
Since market introduction of fosaprepitant (cumulative data from market introduction on 26-Mar-2003 
through 30-Jun-2009), 26 reports of hypersensitivity reactions were identified in which onset occurred 
on Day 1, thereof 12 reports in which the event or events occurred within a few minutes of initiation of 
administration suggesting an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.  
In 9 of these 12 reports there was an immediate hypersensitivity event or events after exposure to IV 
fosaprepitant only (patients did not receive oral aprepitant before or after therapy with fosaprepitant), 
8 of these events resulted in discontinuation of therapy and in 1 of these 9 reports the patient 
successfully tolerated restarting the infusion.  In another 1 of these 12 reports the patient had 
previously tolerated oral aprepitant and then had a hypersensitivity event after exposure to IV 
fosaprepitant. In the last 2 reports the patients subsequently tolerated oral aprepitant after having a 
hypersensitivity related event when exposed to IV fosaprepitant.  In these cases, the most commonly 
reported adverse events were flushing, erythema and dyspnoea.  The patients generally responded to 
discontinuation of the fosaprepitant infusion and initiation of appropriate therapy(ies). 
In order to evaluate the possibility of increased hypersensitivity to fosaprepitant and/or an excipient in 
the formulation, a post-hoc review of potential hypersensitivity adverse events in P017L1 was 
conducted.

One patient treated with the fosaprepitant regimen had a non-serious adverse event of chest 
discomfort, facial flushing and tightness in the throat that resulted is discontinuation of study 
medication. This adverse event occurred on the same day that study medication was administered, and 
was thought to be related to study medication.  
The potential hypersensitivity adverse events for patients treated with fosaprepitant were mostly non 
serious, mostly mild, and were medically managed without significant patient sequelae. The results of 
the analysis of potential hypersensitivity adverse events are consistent with the available post 
marketing data for patients treated with fosaprepitant 115 mg. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (fosaprepitant 
12.9%; aprepitant 13.4%). In general, the serious adverse profile was typical of a patient population 
with cancer receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
23 patients treated with fosaprepitant and 26 patients treated with aprepitant died during the 
observation period of the study. None of these adverse events resulting in death were considered drug 
related by the investigator, and all were consistent with the natural history of patients with cancer 
receiving chemotherapy. 
Laboratory findings 
ALT and AST increase are events listed as common for aprepitant. However, more patients in the 
fosaprepitant group experienced ALT (and AST) increase.

2.6.  Discussion & Conclusion on Clinical Safety 
Fosaprepitant 115 mg is licensed as an alternative to aprepitant 125 mg day 1. This application refers 
to an increase in dose to 150 mg IV in order to cover the full period of CINV. No peak associated 
adverse reactions have previously been seen, but dose related local reactions. Therefore the duration 
of the infusion was increased for the 150 mg dose (20-30 min) compared with the 115 mg dose (15 
min). 
In study P017L1 no likely informative differences were detected in the AE summary between the 
treatment arms. 
Among adverse reactions listed as common for aprepitant, however, asthenia was reported less often 
in the fosaprepitant arm. Numerically less often also hiccup, headache and diarrhoea, while 
constipation was more frequently reported in the fosaprepitant arm. Infusion site pain was reported in 
1.4% vs. 0.1, fosaprepitant vs. aprepitant. Overall, differences are small. 
Compared with placebo a modest increase of injection site reactions was documented.  
Available data, including post marketing reports, indicate that infusion of fosaprepitant is associated 
with hypersensitivity reactions, mainly of mild character and at an incidence considered clinically 
acceptable. 
There is a signal compatible with an increased incidence of ALT/AST elevations compared with 
aprepitant. The most likely reason, however, is baseline imbalances with respect to underlying hepatic 
conditions. 
Compared with the licensed oral aprepitant three-day regimen, fosaprepitant 150 mg administered 
once on day 1, there are only minor safety differences. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have 
been reported, injection site reactions too, but incidence and grade are considered to have only a 
minor impact on the relative risk profile. Some events were reported less frequently in association with 
fosaprepitant such as asthenia. Overall fosaprepitant is considered to have a favourable safety profile. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.7.1.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  (DDPS  version  6.0,  dated  22nd  June  2009) 
as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. 
2.7.2.  Risk management plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan (version no. 3.1 dated 23 June 2010).

  EUSPC Section 4.4 (Special warning and 
precautions for use): Administration and 
infusion site reactions: IVEMEND should 
not be given as a bolus injection, but 
should always be diluted and given as a 
slow intravenous infusion (see section 
4.2). IVEMEND should not be 
administered intramuscularly or 
subcutaneously (see section 5.3). Mild 
injection site thrombosis has been 
observed at higher doses (see section  
4.9). If signs or symptoms of local 
irritation occur, the injection or infusion 
should be terminated and restarted in 
another vein. 
  Listed as ADE under SPC section 4.8 
  EUSPC Section 5.3 (Pre-clinical safety 
data): In rabbits, IVEMEND caused initial 
transient local acute inflammation 
following paravenous, subcutaneous and 
intramuscular administration. At the end 
of the follow-up period (post-dose day 
8), local subacute inflammation was 
noted following paravenous and 
intramuscular administration and 
additional focal muscle 
degeneration/necrosis following 
intramuscular administration, with 
evidence of ongoing resolutionat the 
injection sites.

Preparation of IVEMEND 150 mg for 
intravenous administration: 
1. 
2. 
Inject 5 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9 %) solution for injection into the 
vial. Assure that sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection 
is added to the vial along the vial wall 
in order to prevent foaming. Swirl the 
vial gently. Avoid shaking and jetting 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) 
solution for injection into the vial. 
Prepare an infusion bag filled with 
145 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9 %) solution for injection (for 
example, by removing 105 ml of 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) 
solution for injection from a 250 ml 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) 
solution for injection infusion bag). 
3.  Withdraw the entire volume from the 
vial and transfer it into an infusion bag 
containing 145 ml of sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection 
to yield a total volume of 150 ml. 
Gently invert the bag 2-3 times.

  EUSPC  Section  5.2  (Pharmacokinetic

  Hepatic 
Fosaprepitant  is  metabolized  in  various 
extrahepatic  tissues;  therefore  hepatic 
impairment  is  not  expected  to  alter  the 
conversion 
to 
aprepitant.  Mild  hepatic 
impairment 
(Child-Pugh  class  A)  does  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  aprepitant  to  a 
clinically 
relevant  extent.  No  dose 
adjustment is necessary for patients with 
mild  hepatic  impairment.  Conclusions 
regarding  the  influence  of  moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  B) 
on  aprepitant  pharmacokinetics  cannot 
be drawn from available data. There are 
no  clinical  or  pharmacokinetic  data  in 
patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C). 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional 
risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.7.2.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation for the IVEMEND package leaflet has been performed. The applicant had argued 
that since no significant change have been made to the PL, it was considered appropriate to use the 
evidence from a readability testing performed on a reference PL (EMEND PL) for the 150 mg IVEMEND 
PL part of the line extension application. This approach was not accepted by CHMP. The Applicant is 
asked to submit a full user testing report (as per the readability guideline) as a FUM. This is based on 
the fact that the package leaflet for IVEMEND has not been user tested before, neither for the 115 mg 
nor the 150 mg version. Furthermore, the risk of medication errors between the two strengths is 
considered high. 
2.7.3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
Fosaprepitant, at a dose of 150 mg administered as a single infusion over 20 to 30 minutes, provides a 
similarly effective alternative to the approved 3-day regimen of aprepitant. 
Unfavourable effects 
Compared with placebo a modest increase of injection site reactions was documented. Available data, 
including post marketing reports, indicate that infusion of fosaprepitant (also the licensed 115 mg 
formulation) is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, mainly of mild character and at an incidence 
considered clinically acceptable. 
EMA/559664/2010  
Page 36/37 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is a signal related to an apparent increase in hepatic enzyme adverse events in patients 
administered fosaprepitant 150 mg compared with aprepitant. Confounding factors are considered the 
most likely reason for this. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Ivemend administered in a single dose of 150 mg as add-on a 5HT3 antagonist/glucorticosteroid 
regimen for the treatment of CINV has a favourable benefit – risk profile which is similar to the 
currently licensed 3-day regimen of aprepitant. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit–risk profile of Ivemend 150 mg is positive. All comments to the product information 
have been addressed satisfactorily;The applicant has provided a Letter of Undertaking committing to 
perform the post-authorisation follow up measures as detailed in section 2.6 in the agreed timeframes. 
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted (version 3.1 dated 23 June 2010). The CHMP, having 
considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  
 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.7.4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Ivemend 150 mg powder for solution for infusion in the prevention of 
acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic  cisplatin-based  cancer 
chemotherapy  in  adults,  the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately 
emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults given as part of a combination therapy  was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

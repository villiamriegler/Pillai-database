SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Introduction 
Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a common term used to describe a complex of lower urinary 
tract symptoms (LUTS). The symptoms include urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, 
usually  accompanied  by  frequency  and  nocturia  when  appearing  in  the  absence  of  pathologic  or 
metabolic  factors  which  would  account  for  these  symptoms1,  2  Patients  with  an  overactive  bladder 
include those with and without a possible neurological cause for their symptoms. 
Incontinence  is  not  necessary  for  diagnosis;  however  is  a  chronic  condition  present  in  over  half  of 
female patients with OAB. Urinary incontinence is defined by the International Continence Society 1, 2 
as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine. 
The key symptom of OAB is urgency, the sudden compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer. 
Frequency  is  defined  as  the  patient  complaint  of  voiding  too  often  by  day,  and  nocturia  is  the 
complaint that the individual wakes at night to void. Urge incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine 
accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency. 1, 2 
Other  types  of  urinary  incontinence  include  stress  incontinence  and  mixed  incontinence.  Stress 
incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion or on sneezing or 
coughing.  Mixed  incontinence  is  the  complaint  of  involuntary  leakage  associated  with  urgency  and 
with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing. 1, 2 
Observations made during urodynamic testing do not represent a definite diagnose 1, 2. The overactive 
bladder is a chronic condition defined urodynamically as detrussor overactivity, and characterised by 
involuntary bladder contractions during the filling phase of the micturition cycle. 
The  precise  aetiology  of  overactive  bladder  is  unknown.  Neurologic  illness  or  injury,  bladder  outlet 
obstruction,  urethral  weakness,  detrussor  hyperactivity,  emergence  of  new  voiding  reflexes  and 
idiopathic bladder overactivity are considered within the causes of OAB. 
The  prevalence  of  OAB  has  probably  been  underestimated  because  nearly  all  epidemiologic  studies 
have  been  previously  focused  on  urinary  incontinence  and  because  many  patients  are  reluctant  to 
discuss the subject with their doctors. Nevertheless, the recent standardisation of terminology by the 
International  Continence  Society  (ICS)  1,  2  has  facilitated  obtaining  reliable  epidemiologic  data  on 
OAB.  The  overall  prevalence  in  Europe  has  been  estimated  to  be  16.6%  on  the  basis  of  a  
population-based survey (15.6% for men and 17.4% for women)3. Although the overall prevalence is 
similar in men and women, there is a female-to-male preponderance in the prevalence of OAB with 
urge  urinary  incontinence,  while  OAB  without  urge  urinary  incontinence  is  more  prevalent  in  men. 
Moreover,  the  prevalence  of  OAB  symptomatology  increased  with  advancing  age  in  both  men  and 
women (41.9% of men and 31.3% of women over the age of 75 years) 3. Finally, obesity is associated 
with  symptoms  of  OAB,  and  the  relationship  between  body  mass  index  (BMI)  and  OAB  with  urge

urinary  incontinence  appears  stronger  than  that  between  BMI  and  OAB  without  urge  urinary 
incontinence3. 
The functional integrity of the lower urinary tract, the kidneys, and the nervous system (predominantly 
under the control of the parasympathetic nervous system) are the key factors to maintain continence 
and bladder function. Bladder function involves a bladder filling and urine storage phase, which leads 
to a bladder emptying phase. A stable bladder wall muscle (detrusor) and a functional sphincter allow 
bladder filling during the storage phase4. 
Undesired bladder muscle contraction may occur as the result of a break in the neurological pathway 
from the brain to the bladder. It can also occur if the bladder is irritated and the normal neurological 
impulses to inhibit urination are insufficient to keep the bladder relaxed as it fills. 
The  course  of  OAB  is  not  life  threatening,  however  symptoms  may  diminish  the  psychosocial, 
occupational,  and  sexual  function  of  patients  affecting  quality  of  life.  Patients  consider  urinary 
leakage, frequency and urgency to be bothersome5. Complications and comorbidities include urinary 
tract  infection  (UTI),  skin  ulceration  in  OAB  with  urge  incontinence,  and  a  greater  risk  of  bone 
fracture from a fall, although some research has found little association. Sleep disturbances, restricted 
motility, isolation and depression are described as the psychological and lifestyle related consequences 
of OAB. 
Treatment may be managed using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. 
Nonpharmacologic treatment: 
Include  lifestyle  changes  (controlled  fluid  intake),  behavioural  therapies,  pelvic  floor  electrical 
stimulation, and surgical procedures. 
Standard behavioural therapies include bladder training which focuses on voiding habits. 
Pelvic muscle training exercises called Kegel exercises are primarily used to treat patients with stress 
incontinence. 
Pharmacological treatment: 
Medicinal products are aimed at diminish or suppress the intensity of involuntary detrusor contractions 
and  include  anticholinergic  agents,  antispasmodic  medications,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  and  beta 
agonist. 
With  geographic  differences,  currently  approved  medical  treatments  are  propiverine,  propantheline, 
solifenacin,  oxybutynin,  tolterodine,  flavoxate,  darifenacine,  imipramine,  doxepin,  terbutaline  and 
trospium. 
Oxybutynin and tolterodine are antispasmodic medications and are the most commonly used.

Quality Aspects 
Introduction 
TOVIAZ is presented as prolonged-release tablets containing 4 mg and 8 mg of fesoterodine fumarate 
as  active  substance  (corresponding  to  3.1  mg  and  6.2  mg  fesoterodine  respectively).  The  other 
ingredients  are  xylitol,  lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  hypromellose,  glycerol 
dibehenate and talc. The film-coat consists polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol 3350, talc, 
soya lecithin and indigo camine aluminium lake.  
The prolonged-release tablets are packaged in aluminium-aluminium blisters. 
Drug Substance  
The drug substance is presented as the fumarate salt. Fesoterodine fumarate is Isobutyric acid 2-((R)-
fumarate 
3-diisopropylammonium-1-phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl 
according to the IUPAC nomenclature. 
hydrogen 
ester 
Fesoterodine fumarate is a white to off-white powder. It is freely soluble in aqueous solvents, soluble 
in  some  polar  protic  organic  solvents  (such  as  ethanol,  methanol,  glacial  acetic  acid,  2-propanol, 
propylene glycol) and polar non protic solvents (such as acetone, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile ), slightly 
soluble in toluene and it is practically insoluble in heptane. 
•  Manufacture 
Fesoterodine fumarate is synthesised in eight reactions steps with two solid isolations. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified 
and adequate in-process controls included. 
Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of 
intermediates has been presented. 
Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  ultraviolet  spectroscopy, 
infrared  absorption 
spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, optical rotation and 
chiral capillary electrophoresis. The results of the elemental analysis are consistent with the proposed 
molecular formula. Unambiguous proof of structure was provided by X-ray crystallography. 
•  Specification 
The  active  substance  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  particle  size,  identification  (IR  and 
HPLC), melting point, water content (Karl Fischer), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur. –
the specification only refers to the current Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC), chiral 
purity (Capillary electrophoresis), specific optical rotation (Polarimetry) and assay (HPLC). 
The  specifications  attributes  reflect  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance.  The 
analytical methods which were used in the routine controls were described and their validations are in 
accordance with the ICH Guidelines.  
©EMEA 2007 
3/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Impurities  have  been  extensively  described,  classified  as  process  related  impurities  and  possible 
degradation  products,  and  qualified.  Impurity  limits  in  the  specification  are  justified  by  toxicology 
studies. 
The residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance. All batch analysis results 
comply with the specification and show a good uniformity from batch to batch. 
•  Stability 
The stability results from long-term, accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH 
guidelines and demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. It was confirmed that the active 
substance is very stable when exposed to a variety of stressed conditions such as, thermal, humidity, 
acid or alkaline conditions, oxidizing conditions and light exposure. The results of the long-term and 
accelerated studies support the retest period.  
Drug Product  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. 
The  drug  substance  fesoterodine  fumarate  was  developed  with  the  objective  of  having  a  crystalline 
and stable substance, but the free base of the drug substance was not suitable for processing since it is 
an  oily  liquid  and  does  not  have  crystalline  properties.  Therefore,  the  hydrogen  fumarate  salt  was 
chosen  as  a  drug  substance  which  is  a  crystalline  non-hygroscopic  substance  with  relatively  high 
melting point. 
Fesoterodine tablets are formulated as a prolonged release formulation in order to provide a once daily 
dosage  form.  The  formulation  is  a  hydrogel  matrix  tablet  based  on  hypromellose.  Results  of 
formulation  and  process  development  studies  demonstrate  that  the  tablet  formulation  and  the 
manufacturing process are robust. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard 
manufacturing processes such as wet granulation, drying, dry blending, compression and coating unit 
operations. Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. 
The  major  steps  to  prepare  fesoterodine  tablets  are  the  wet  granulation  and  drying  processes  for  the 
manufacture  of  the  granules,  dry  blending  of  granulate  with  remaining  excipients,  and  the  tablet 
compression process. The wet granulation process was optimized with regard to sieve size, amount of 
water and mixing time. 
The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according the agreed finished product specification. 
•  Product Specification 
The  drug  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the 
following tests: appearance, odour (sensory examination), size, identification (HPLC, UV), impurities 
(HPLC),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer),  dissolution,  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  unit  and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
• 
 Stability of the Product 
The stability studies were conducted according to the current ICH guideline. Three production scale 
batches of each strength have been stored at long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions in the 
proposed market packaging. 
©EMEA 2007

One production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature light exposure and humidity 
conditions for 3 months and at ICH conditions. 
Based  on  the  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the 
SPC are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant guidelines. The 
results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  finished  product. 
Therefore, this  medicinal  product is expected to have a  satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  two  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  which  have  no 
impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal product.  The  applicant  gave  a  letter  of  undertaking 
and committed to resolve these as follow up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
All  pivotal  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  including  the  determination  of  plasma 
concentrations  of  fesoterodine  and/or  SPM  7605  were  carried  out  in  conformance  with  Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards with the exceptions of an in vitro follow-up electrophysiological 
study  (sodium  channel,)  and  the  determination  of  the  secondary  metabolites  in  selected  plasma 
samples.  
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
In vitro studies 
Binding  of  fesoterodine  and  several  of  its  in  vivo  metabolites  to  human  recombinant  muscarinic 
acetylcholine  receptors  (M1-M5)  stably  expressed  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  was 
investigated  in  competition  binding  experiments.  For  comparison,  tolterodine  was  used  as  the 
reference  compound.  SPM  7605,  the  primary  in  vivo  metabolite,  bound  with  high  affinity  to  all  the 
muscarinic receptors subtypes, see table below. There was no selectivity of SPM 7605 in binding to 
these receptors. Fesoterodine was also non-selective and had at least a 100-fold lower binding affinity 
than the active metabolite.

In  a  separate  study  the  binding  affinity  of  tolterodine,  fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  to  all  human

The data obtained in this study are qualitatively comparable to those presented previously. All three 
compounds  showed  no  selectivity  towards  the  5  muscarinic  receptor  subtypes.  SPM  7605  exhibited 
the highest affinity, while fesoterodine was much less potent. The difference in the absolute numbers 
measured  in  these  studies  in  comparison  to  the  study  reported  above  may  be  explained  by  different 
cell  clones  and  expression  systems  used  by  the  two  different  laboratories,  which  performed  the 
studies. 
The specificity of fesoterodine and of its metabolite SPM 7605 was investigated in a broad screen of 
41 receptors and ion channels. In particular, fesoterodine and its metabolite SPM 7605 do not interact 
with α-adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and excitatory amino acid receptors. 
Functional  antimuscarinic  activity  in  vitro  was  demonstrated  in  organ  bath  studies  with  isolated 
bladder  strips,  where  maximum  inhibition  of  electrical  field  stimulation-induced  contractions  were 
observed at fesoterodine and SPM 7605 concentrations of 0.1 µM, tolterodine 0.3 µM, oxybutynin 0.1 
µM and atropine 0.1 µM. 
Both fesoterodine and the active metabolite SPM 7605 showed pronounced spasmolytic properties in 
the guinea-pig ileum model in vitro as can be expected from the anticholinergic mechanism of action. 
In vivo studies 
Intravenous administration of fesoterodine and SPM 7605 reduced micturition pressure and increased 
bladder  capacity  and  intercontraction  intervals  at  0.01  mg/kg  in  the  rat  model  (Breidenbach  et  al, 
2002). 
The effects of SPM 7605 on urinary bladder contractions and salivation were also investigated in cats 
(Nilvebrant et al, 1997). SPM 7605 dose-dependently inhibited acetylcholine-induced contractions of 
the  bladder  (ID50  5.1  µg/kg).  There  was  also  a  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  electrically  stimulated 
salivation  observed  with  an  ID50  of  13.7  µg/kg.  This  indicates  that  SPM  7605  is  three  times  more 
potent at the urinary bladder compared to the salivary gland. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics and Safety pharmacology  
Cardiovascular system 
The cardiovascular system has been extensively investigated both in vitro and in vivo. 
In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells expressing hERG, fesoterodine and SPM 7605 induced a 
concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 values of 3.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. 
The metabolite SPM 5509 showed a similar concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current (IC50 
=  3.3  µM)  while  the  metabolite  SPM  6923  had  a  weaker  effect  (inhibition  of  22%  at  300  µM,  the 
highest  concentration  tested).  In  single  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells  expressing  the  human  SCN5A 
gene, SPM 7605 concentration dependently reduced the fast sodium current.

Blockade  of  the  hERG-mediated  potassium  current  has  also  been  observed  for  other  antimuscarinic 
agents  such  as  solifenacin  (IC500.27 µmol/L),  tolterodine  (IC500.009 µmol/L)  and  darifenacin 
(IC500.077 µmol/L).

The  cardiac  electrophysiological  studies  were  performed  with  fesoterodine  and  its  metabolite 
SPM7605. 
In  vitro,  a  concentration-dependent  increase  in  action  potential  duration  was  observed  in  isolated 
canine Purkinje fibres at 70% (APD70) and 90% (APD90) from 1.5x10-7 to 1.5x10-6 M. The increase 
was  statistically  significant  at  1.5x10-6  M.  At  1.5x10-5  M,  APD50  and  APD70  were  decreased, 
associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  amplitude  of  action  potential  and  in  the  depolarisation  rate, 
suggesting an interaction with the sodium channel. 
In vivo, a dose-dependent tachycardia with no change in mean arterial pressure was observed in rats 
dosed  with  fesoterodine  3-30  mg/kg  as  expected  from  the  antimuscarinic  effect  of  fesoterodine. 
Moreover, a dose-dependent decrease in baroreflex sensitivity was observed which might indicate that 
fesoterodine can induce orthostatic hypotension in man, however, this has not translated in to a clinical 
signal.  
In vivo, in anaesthetised dogs, slight decreases (3 to 9%) in systolic blood pressure, pulmonary arterial 
pressure and renal artery blood flow were found at 8 µg/kg of intravenous fesoterodine. 
At a dose of 800 µg/kg i.v., decreases in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and coronary artery blood 
flow and prolongation of the QT interval and QTc interval were noted. However, in a 13-week toxicity 
study with continuous intravenous infusion of SPM7605 in dogs, no effect on the QT or QTc interval 
was  observed  at  free  plasma  concentrations  21-33  fold  higher  than  measured  following  8  mg  in 
humans. The clinical relevance of these findings for humans  is not clear . (See clinical section)  
Central nervous system 
The main CNS-related effect of fesoterodine is a slight CNS stimulatory effect observed in mice (10-
30  mg/kg  p.o.)  in  behavioural  tests.  In  accordance  with  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action,  the 
increases in restlessness and spontaneous locomotor activity are expected. Fesoterodine (3-30 mg/kg) 
had  a  slight  analgesic  effect  at  30  mg/kg  but  no  pro-convulsive  or  anticonvulsive  properties.  A 
statistically significant decrease in body temperature was observed at 3 mg/kg at one time point only 
but not at 10 or 30 mg/kg and is considered of low clinical relevance. 
Other organ systems 
No relevant effects have been observed on respiratory, autonomic nervous, renal and gastro-intestinal 
systems. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The ability of fesoterodine to interact pharmacodynamically with other drugs has not been 
investigated. However, the mechanism of action of muscarinic receptor antagonist is well documented 
and potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions are published.

Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed but rapidly metabolized to SPM 7605, mainly 
in mice and rats. Tmax was approximately 0.5 h for mouse, rat and rabbit and 1 h in dogs. 
Bioavailability was determined to be 50, 14 and 98% in mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. Due to a 
rapid hydrolysis of fesoterodine only SPM 7605, the major metabolite, was determined in mouse, rat, 
rabbit and human plasma.  Fesoterodine is  more  slowly hydrolysed in dogs, where both fesoterodine 
and SPM 7605 can be detected in plasma. The extent of systemic exposure was characterized by non-
linear (dose-dependent) kinetics with a more than dose-proportionate increase of fesoterodine in dogs 
and of SPM 7605 in mice and dogs. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC of fesoterodine and its metabolites, in the plasma of 
human subjects, and in mice and dogs at the NOAEL are compared below.

Data presented are after single oral administration of 8 mg fesoterodine in Phase 1 trial SP567 
(arithmetic mean ± SD, n=11) and after repeated oral administration to mice (NOAEL=25 mg/kg/day, 
6-month study) and dogs (NOAEL=2.5 mg/kg/day, 9-month study) as individual data.

Distribution 
The  distribution  of  [14C]  fesoterodine  and/or  its  metabolites  was  studied  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs 
following oral administration. Fesoterodine was widely distributed in mice and rats. Highest levels of 
radioactivity were found in organs involved in drug elimination; however no specific affinity/uptake to 
organs/tissues was detected. No notable accumulation was observed. In dogs, the radioactivity is less 
widely distributed with highest concentrations of radioactivity detected in the intestinal tract. A slight 
accumulation  was  observed  in  skin  and  eyes.  [14C]  Fesoterodine  and/or  its  metabolites  crossed  the 
blood-brain barrier to a low extent and did cross the placenta and distribute into fetal tissues in mice. 
The serum protein binding was low (21-30%) in mouse, rat and dog comparable to that in man (53%). 
Metabolism 
©EMEA 2007 
8/48 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In  vitro,  fesoterodine  is  extensively  metabolized  by  non-cytochrome  P450  activity  to  the  major 
metabolite  SPM  7605  (human,  rabbit  >  mouse  >  dog  >>  rat).  Further  metabolism  takes  place  via 
CYP2D6  to  the  carboxy  metabolite  SPM  5509  (major)  or  via  CYP3A4  to  the  N-desisopropyl 
metabolite SPM 7789 (minor). Both SPM 5509 and SPM 7789 are then further metabolized to SPM 
7790. 
In  vivo,  in  all  animal  species  (and  humans),  the  major  biotransformation  pathways  involved  rapid 
hydrolysis  that  leads  to  the  formation  of  SPM  7605  followed  by  oxidation  and  N-dealkylation 
(mediated both by CYP activity). In these species, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma and SPM 
7605  can  be  regarded  both  as  major  metabolite  and  active  principle  of  fesoterodine.  No  gender 
differences have been observed except in the rat. The dog does not hydrolyze fesoterodine to the same 
extent as observed in the other species, thus fesoterodine can be detected in plasma of the dog together 
with the other metabolites. 
No  or  low  inhibitory  interactions  with  CYP1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6  and  3A4  were  detectable  for 
fesoterodine.  
Excretion 
Fesoterodine and/or its metabolites are rapidly excreted with the majority of the dose recovered within 
48 hours. In the dog, the majority of radioactivity (60-67%) was excreted in urine. Both urinary and 
fecal  elimination  are  relevant  in  the  mouse.  In  the  rat,  the  largest  portion  of  radioactivity  was 
recovered in feces. In humans, about 70% of an oral dose of fesoterodine is recovered in urine. 
Toxicology 
The  toxicity  of  single  doses  of  fesoterodine  has  been  investigated  via  the  oral  and  i.v.  routes  of 
administration in the mouse and rat. 
Repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  mouse,  rat  and  Beagle  dog.  Based  on 
pharmacokinetic/metabolism data, the mouse and dog are considered the most relevant animal species 
for the human situation, the rat being less relevant due to different metabolism. 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Dose-related  clinical  signs  were  mainly  CNS  related  such  as  reduced  motility, ataxia,  dyspnoea  and 
reduced muscle tone starting at 215 mg/kg (oral) or 21.5 mg/kg (iv).  Approximate LD50 in the mouse 
was 316/31.6 mg/kg and in the rat 681 (males) 454 (females)/31.6 mg/kg  
Toxicokinetic  data  are  available  from  the  acute  toxicity  studies  using  p.o.  administration.  The 
exposure in mice and rats at the non-lethal dose 215 mg/kg was respectively 80-300 times and 12-30 
times the human exposure. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Fesoterodine was administered orally to mouse for 6 months, rats for 3 months and Beagle dogs for 9 
months.  Furthermore,  mice  were  dosed  via  4-hour/day  intravenous  infusion  with  fesoterodine  18 
mg/kg for 14 days. Dogs were treated similarly with fesoterodine 6 mg/kg for 14 days (4-hour/day), 
and with SPM 7605 4.5 mg/kg for 13 weeks (24-hour/day). The main target organ of toxicity was the 
liver in rat. No target organ of toxicity was identified in the mouse or the dog. 
Mice were dosed at 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg, the latter increased in week 16 at 125 mg/kg (females) and 
100  mg/kg  (males)  of  fesoterodine  by  oral  gavage  for  6  months.  Some  high  dose  animals  died 
probably  in  relation  to  urinary  tract  infection  secondary  to  bladder  distension,  an  exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic (antimuscarinic) effect of fesoterodine/SPM 7605. High dose animals showed also 
piloerection  and  a  slightly  reduced  body  weight  gain  (5%  in  males  and  8%  in  females),  a  slight 
reduction  (20-24%)  in  platelets  in  both  male  and  female  and    a  slight  increase  in  glucose  (26%)  in 
female  only.  Triglycerides  were  significantly  reduced  and  plasma  urea  was  increased  in  high  dose 
male  mice  in  week  13  and  26.  These  moderate  changes,  without  corresponding  findings  in  clinical

trials, are considered of low clinical relevance. 
The NOAEL was 25 mg/kg at which Cmax was 144 ng/ml in males and 258 in females and AUC 379 
h  ng/ml  in  males  and  575  h  ng/ml  in  females.  Thus  based  on  Cmax  the  exposure  margin  to  human 
exposure is 16-30 and 4-6 based on AUC values. 
No additional toxicological effects were observed in studies of shorter duration or in a 14-days study 
with intravenous infusion where exposure did not exceed the exposure obtained in the high dose group 
dosed by oral gavage. 
Rats were dosed with 5, 25 and 75 mg/kg fesoterodine by oral gavage (13 week MTD study). Body 
weight was reduced (3-11%) in high dose males while only a marginal effect was noted in females. 
The food consumption was decreased by approximately 10% in both males and females. A dose of 75 
mg/kg  resulted  in  increased  bilirubin,  cholesterol,  ALAT,  ASAT,  ALP  activity  and  triglycerides. 
Absolute  and  relative  liver  weights  were  significantly  increased  in  females  at  25  mg/kg  and  in  both 
sexes of the high dose group. Histopathology showed a minimal to moderate pericholangitis with mild 
bile duct proliferation in high dose females. Thus, the target organ of toxicity is the liver in rats most 
pronounced in females. 
In a supplementary study including toxicokinetics, at dosage of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg, the NOAEL was 
determined to be 15 mg/kg. 
At  a  dose  of  15  mg/kg  Cmax  levels  of  13.9-93.1  ng/ml  has  been  observed  in  male  rats  and 
corresponding  values  for  females  is  6.8-36.8  ng/ml.  AUC  value  for  males  is  125-182  h  ng/ml  and 
47.2-73.4  h  ng/ml  in  females.  Exposure  margins  of  1-10  were  obtained  based  on  Cmax  values  and 
based on AUC values an exposure around clinical exposure was obtained in rats.  
In  the  pivotal  9-month  study  Beagle  dogs  received  fesoterodine  0.5,  2.5  and  12.5  mg/kg  by  oral 
capsule.  The  most  pronounced  clinical  finding  was  related  to  the  eyes:  mydriasis  conjunctivitis  and 
adhered  eyelids.  The  animals  had  to  be  treated  with  artificial  lachrymal  fluid  from  test  day  29 
onwards.  These  effects  are  related  to  the  anticholinergic  mechanism  of  action  of  fesoterodine/SPM 
7605. Clinical biochemistry showed an increase in bilirubin and plasma urea levels. However, this was 
not associated with any drug-related macroscopic or histopathological changes of the liver. 
The electrocardiographic evaluation demonstrated a dose-dependent (animals dosed with 2.5 and 12.5 
mg/kg) increase in heart rate in male and female dogs estimated 4 hours after dosing. The effect had 
nearly subsided 24 hours after dosing and no effect on QRS, QT, QTc, PQ-intervals and P segment 
were observed. In addition no effect on blood pressure was noted. 
The  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  2.5  mg/kg,  all  effects  being  considered  as  exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effects of fesoterodine/SPM 7605. 
•  Genotoxicity 
In  vitro,  fesoterodine  has  been  tested  in  Ames  test  and  in  chromosomal  aberration  tests  using 
metabolic activation both from rat and mouse liver. No induced mutation frequency or chromosomal 
aberrations  were  observed  up  to  cytotoxic  concentrations  of  fesoterodine  either  with  or  without 
metabolic activation.  
In vivo, fesoterodine has been tested in the micronucleus test (bone marrow) in mice at a maximum 
oral dose of 250 mg/kg. No genotoxic effects were induced. Toxicokinetic data were not estimated in 
this  study,  however  based  on  data  from  other  toxicity  studies  an  adequate  exposure  level  of  the 
animals has been reached. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
Two  104  weeks  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  mice  and  rats.  In  the  mice  study, 
©EMEA 2007 
10/48 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
groups of 50 males and 50 females received 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg by oral gavage. The 45 mg/kg dose 
did  not  result  in  sufficient  degree  of  toxicity  and  the  dose  was  increased  to  60  mg/kg  but  was  later 
reduced to 45 and 30 mg/kg in males due to high mortality rates. The survival rate was 32% in high 
dosed males and 38% in females. A tightly filled intestine and rectum was noted in all dosage groups 
related  to  the  anticholinerigic  mechanism  of  action  of  fesoterodine/SPM  7605.  No  difference  in 
neoplastic lesions was observed between animals on active treatment compared to placebo. 
In  rats  groups  of  50  males  and  50  females/group  were  treated  with  5,  15,  and  45  mg/kg  by  oral 
gavage. The 45 mg/kg dose did not result in sufficient degree of toxicity thus the dose was increased 
to  60  mg/kg.  No  difference  in  neoplastic  lesions  was  observed  between  animals  on  active  treatment 
compared  to  placebo.  At  histopathology,  tightly  filled  urinary  bladder  and  minimal  to  moderately 
reduced secretory activity in salivary glands and lacrimal glands were noted. These effects are related 
to the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. 
The exposure to SPM 7605 at the high dose level was Cmax 340.68 ng/ml and AUC 1406.3 h ng/ml in 
males and Cmax 286.40 ng/ml and AUC 740.7 h ng/ml in females. Thus, exposure margins of 7-14 
based on AUC and 33-39 based on Cmax are obtained. 
In conclusion, fesoterodine was not carcinogenic in mice and rats. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
In  male  mice,  no  effects  on  clinical  signs,  body  weight  gain  or  male  fertility  parameters  (sperm 
number, motility and viability, weight of testis and epididymis) were observed up to maximum dose of 
fesoterodine 45 mg/kg. 
Female mice dosed with 45 mg/kg showed a marginal reduction in body weight probably caused by 
the reduced number of fetuses. The number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was 
slightly  but  significantly  reduced.  The  uterine  weight  was  slightly  but  significantly  decreased 
correlated  with  the  reduced  number  of  fetuses.  Fesoterodine  had  no  effect  on  resorption  rate, 
preimplantation and post-implantation loss.  The NOEL for fertility was 15 mg/kg which corresponds 
to a Cmax value of 43.4-77.3 ng/ml resulting in exposure margins of 5-9 times the human exposure. 
Embryo-fetal development 
In mice, dams at the high dose level (75 mg/kg) showed a decrease in body weight which was caused 
by the increased resorption rate. No maternal toxicity was seen. Embryotoxicity was observed evident 
as  a slight but statistically significant reduction in body weight for male fetuses at 45 mg/kg; at 75 
mg/kg for both male and female fetuses. Furthermore, at 75 mg/kg an increase in the number of total 
resorptions was observed. The mean post-implantation loss was 16.6%; and complete in one female. 
Accordingly, the number of live fetuses was decreased. Four malformed fetuses were noted, three with 
cleft palate in each of the dosage groups (15, 45 and 75 mg/mg). One 45 mg/kg fetus had exencephaly. 
The NOEL was 15 mg/kg which corresponds to a Cmax value of 79.7 ng/ml resulting in an exposure 
margin of 9 times the human exposure.  
In  rabbits,  no  maternal  toxicity  (net  body  weight  gain  or  decreased  food  consumption)  was  seen 
following oral gavage administration of fesoterodine. In the high dose group (27 mg/kg p.o.) the post-
implantation  loss  was  slightly  (+17.1%)  increased  and  the  number  of  resorptions  was  threefold 
increased.  One  high  dose  dam  had  complete  post-implantation  loss  early  during  gestation.  Seven 
malformed fetuses, uni- or bilateral hyperflexion of the fore and/or hind paws and/or crossed legs were 
noted in three controls, two 3 mg/kg and two 27 mg/kg fetuses. These changes were considered to be 
within  the  normal  range.  At  27  mg/kg,  a  statistically  significant  increased  incidence  of  retarded 
ossification  of  the  sternebra(e)  and  total  retardations  was  noted.  The  NOEL  was  9  mg/kg  which 
corresponds  to  a  Cmax  value  of  57.3  ng/ml  resulting  in  an  exposure  margin  of  6  times  the  human 
exposure.

A  study  in  rabbits  using  subcutaneous  bolus  injection  of  fesoterodine  0.5,  1.5  and  4.5  mg/kg  which 
enabled a high exposure did not demonstrate any embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Severe maternal 
toxicity  was  observed  at  the  high  dose  level  while  only  slight  maternal  toxicity  was  observed  with 
administration via oral gavage up to a dose of 27 mg/kg. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
The peri- and postnatal toxicity was investigated in the mouse at dose levels of 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. 
Evidence of maternal toxicity of the F0–dams was noted at the high dose level as slightly decreased 
body weight from gestation day 10 onwards which did correlate with the reduced number of fetuses. A 
decreased body weight gain was noted at the end of lactation weeks 1 and 2 (-11% and -10%). Similar 
effects were observed on food consumption. Slight effects on reproduction, not statistically significant 
were noted at the 30 and 60 mg/kg dose levels; slightly reduced number of implantations and slightly 
reduced  number  of  pups  alive  at  60  mg/kg.  A  dose-dependent  decrease  in  lactation  and  overall 
survival indices were observed from 30 mg/kg, in addition also decrease in viability at 60 mg/kg. The 
mean body weights of the pups were marginally decreased. No treatment related changes were noted 
at necropsy of the animals. 
In the F1-generation, ear-opening was marginally delayed at 30 and 60 mg/kg and consequently also a  
decreased  response  to  auditory  startle  reflex  by  31.5%  and  46.3%,  respectively.  No  adverse  effects 
were noted on F1-dams and male F1-partners or on the F2-generation until weaning. The NOEL for F0 
and F1 is 10 mg/kg and the NOAEL for F2 is higher than 60 mg/kg resulting in an exposure margin of 
approximately 6. 
In  conclusion,  reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryo-toxicity  (increased  number  of 
resorption, pre-implantation and post-implementation losses). This is mentioned in the SPC. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
The  absence  of  studies  on  juvenile  animals  is  accepted  considering  the  proposed  indication  for 
fesoterodine. 
•  Toxicokinetic data 
The  applicant  has  conducted  a  number  of  toxicokinetic  studies,  where  the  plasma  exposure  to 
fesoterodine  at  the  maximum  therapeutic  dose  (8  mg,  0.11  mg/kg)  has  been  compared  to  reference 
doses in animal studies. 
For exposure comparisons animal versus human, the following human data were used, AUC of 98.3 h 
ng/ml  and  Cmax  of  8.62  ng/ml  (observed  in  healthy  male  volunteers  receiving  the  maximum 
recommended dose of fesoterodine 8 mg, fed status, poor CYP2D6 metabolizers).

The  safety  margins  established  comparing  SPM  7605  AUC  values  show  that  in  chronic  toxicity 
studies  the  average  systemic  exposure  was  at  least  1.5  (dog,  iv)  or  3.9-fold  (mouse)  higher  as 
compared to man. In carcinogenicity studies was at least 7.7- (mouse) or 7.5-fold (rat) higher in terms 
of AUC at the highest dose as compared to man. 
In embryo-foetal development studies, the systemic exposure to SPM 7605 at NOEL (mouse)/NOAEL 
(rabbit) was at least 0.9- (mouse) or 1.3-fold (rabbit, sc) in terms of AUC at the highest dose. In these 
toxicity  studies,  doses  of  fesoterodine  which  caused  no  toxicological  consequences  (NOAEL),  were 
similar to the highest therapeutic dose of fesoterodine. Therefore, the occurrence of the above animal 
findings in humans cannot be ruled out. This is appropriately reflected in the SPC. 
•  Local tolerance  
The potential of fesoterodine and its metabolite SPM 7605, to produce skin irritation was studied in 
rabbits 
.  
In the patch test a very slight erythema and edema were noted. Fesoterodine is classified as irritating 
to eyes. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Fesoterodine did not provoke skin sensitization reactions in guinea pigs.  
Biocompatibility 
Fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  were  studied  for  their  biocompatibility  and  haemolytic  properties  on 
human blood. Neither fesoterodine nor SPM 7605 showed any influence on the parameters observed. 
Immunotoxicity 
The  Plaque  Forming  Colony  test  has  shown  that  fesoterodine  5-75  mg/kg  p.o.  for  28  days  has  no 
immuno-toxicological properties in mice with respect to an antibody response to IgM and IgG.  
Phototoxicity 
According  to  guideline,  photosafety  testing  of  fesoterodine  is  justified..  SPM  7605  revealed  no 
phototoxic potential under the present test conditions.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As per the guideline, a Phase I estimation of exposure based on the fesoterodine fumarate maximum 
daily  dose  of  8  mg  and  the  default  Fpen  value  of  0.01,  results  in  a    PECsurfacewater  =0.04  µg/L, 
which is > the Action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Fesoterodine is a competitive, specific and non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist. It is rapidly 
and  extensively  hydrolysed  by  non-specific  plasma  esterases  to  the  5-hydroxymethyl  derivative 
(SPM 7605) its primary active metabolite, which is much more active than fesoterodine in vitro and in 
vivo  (x100  times  more  affinity  for  muscarinic  receptors  in  vitro  than  fesoterodine).  SPM  7605  is 
therefore  the  main  active  pharmacological  principle  of  fesoterodine.  SPM  7605  is  also  the  main 
metabolite of the marketed medicine tolterodine. 
The  cardiovascular  system  has  been  extensively  investigated  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  Fesoterodine 
and SPM 7605 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 values of 3.6 
and 0.5 µM, respectively. Blockade of the hERG-mediated potassium current has also been observed 
for some other antimuscarinic agents. 
A  dose-dependent  tachycardia  with  no  change  in  mean  arterial  pressure  was  observed  in  rats  as 
expected from a muscarinic antagonist. In vivo, at a dose of 800 µg/kg i.v., decreases in diastolic blood 
pressure,  heart  rate  and  coronary  artery  blood  flow  and  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  and  QTc 
interval were noted in dogs. 
Pharmacokinetics: fesoterodine is rapidly hydrolysed by non-specific plasma esterases to SPM 7605 
in all animal species investigated including man except for the dog in which the rate of hydrolysis is 
slower. The in vitro metabolism of fesoterodine is most different in the rat, which is considered a less 
relevant species.  
In  repeat-dose  toxicity,  the  main  target  organ  of  toxicity  was  the  liver  in  rats  .  No  target  organ  of 
toxicity was identified in the mouse or the dog. Overall, in toxicity studies, animals were exposed at 
the  NOAEL  to  total  amounts  of  fesoterodine  and  its  metabolites  that  little  exceeded  or  almost  were 
equal than that encountered at the highest clinical dose of fesoterodine. 
Fesoterodine was not genotoxic or carcinogenic. 
Reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryo-toxicity  (increased  number  of  resorption,  pre-
implantation and post-implementation losses). This is mentioned in the SPC. 
Phase  II  environmental  studies  will  be  completed  after  the  marketing  authorisation,  as  follow-up 
measures.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical development program for fesoterodine sustained-release (SR) included: 
•  Two double-blind Phase 3 trials (SP583, SP584) plus 2 long-term, open-label extension trials 
(SP738 and SP739), 
•  Two double-blind Phase 2 dose-defining trials (SP582 and SP668) plus a long term extension 
trial, SP669, which is still ongoing, and 
•  Seventeen Phase 1 trials to investigate the clinical pharmacology of fesoterodine SR (in one 
out of these seventeen studies an intravenous formulation was also tested). 
•  An immediate-release (IR) formulation of fesoterodine was used in two Phase 1 trials and a

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  fesoterodine  have  been  characterised  in  healthy  men  and  women  over  a 
single and multiple-dose range of 4 mg to 28 mg/day. 
Nineteen Phase 1 trials, which included 753 subjects, have been completed to investigate the clinical 
pharmacology of fesoterodine.  An immediate-release (IR) formulation of fesoterodine was used in 2 
initial  Phase  1  trials  (Studies  SP560  and  SP561),  including  75  subjects.  In  order  to  enhance  patient 
compliance, a sustained release (SR) tablet was developed for a once daily administration.  A total of 
489  subjects  received  the  SR  formulation  intended  for  approval;  and  28  subjects  received  an 
intravenous formulation in addition to an SR formulation. 
Fesoterodine metabolites were analysed using LC-MS/MS in plasma, urine and faeces. Fesoterodine 
was analysed in plasma using LC-MS/MS. The analytical method validations were found appropriate. 
•  Absorption  
In vitro, the transport of fesoterodine, tolterodine and SPM 7605 across Caco-2 cell monolayers was 
investigated. The permeability coefficient of fesoterodine could not be determined due hydrolysis of 
fesoterodine to SPM 7605 in this study. The permeability constant for tolterodine and SPM 7605 were 
determined to be 1.0 10-5 cm/s and 2.5 x 10-6 cm/s respectively. For propranolol, which was used as 
one of the reference compounds and considered a highly permeable compound according to BCS, the 
permeability coefficient was determined to be 1.1 x 10-5 cm/s. 
In vitro studies have been also conducted with both fesoterodine and its major metabolite SPM 7605 
to characterize whether they are substrates and / or inhibitors of P-gp. These in vitro studies indicate 
that both fesoterodine and SPM 7605 are substrates for P-gp (ATPase Km values = 56 and 105 µM) 
and that both compounds are weak inhibitors of the P-gp mediated transport of digoxin in Caco-2 cells 
(IC50 values of 131 and >300 µM) respectively. Consequently, the likelihood of clinically relevant P-
gp inhibition on fesoterodine and SPM 7605 is considered to be low in clinical practice given the wide 
margin between IC50 and maximal systemic concentrations. 
After administration of the IR formulation, tmax is reached after approximately 0.5-1 hour. The rate of 
absorption  across  all  Phase  1  trials  is  comparable  with  tmax  being  approximately  5  hours  for  the 
prolonged release formulation.  
The rate of absorption is constant over the dose range of 4 to 28 mg fesoterodine and is comparable 
after single or multiple-dose administration. The Cmax levels after a single dose of 4 and 8 mg of the 
prolonged  release  tablets  were  in  mean  values  approximately  1.90-2.20  ng/ml  and  3-6  ng/ml 
respectively (data from all phase I studies, no food interaction). See table 1 for a comparison between 
the immediate release and the prolonged release formulation.

Maximum  plasma  levels  of  SPM  7605  are  achieved  approximately  5  hours  after  administration  of 
fesoterodine SR. The rate of absorption is constant over the dose range of 4 to 28mg fesoterodine and 
is comparable after single or multiple-dose administration.  
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  fesoterodine  could  not  be  determined,  due  to  the  rapid  hydrolysis  of 
fesoterodine  to  SPM  7605.  Fesoterodine  was  only  measurable  after  i.v.  administration.  The 
bioavailability of SPM 7605 after oral administration of 8 mg fesoterodine could be determined to be 
52 % compared to fesoterodine i.v. and 42 % compared to SPM 7605 i.v. 
Exposure to SPM 7605 was 22% increased in the fed state as compared to the fasted state. Although 
bioequivalence between the 2 treatments could not be demonstrated the difference is considered not to 
be clinically relevant. Therefore, dose adjustment with regard to food is not necessary.  
•  Distribution 
The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  SPM  7605  was  169L  (CV  17.1%)  following  intravenous 
administration of SPM 7605 (study SP567),. 
Plasma protein binding of SPM 7605 is approximately 50%, with a similar affinity to human serum 
albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein.  
•  Metabolism and Excretion 
Fesoterodine  functionally  acts  as  a  pro-drug.  After  oral  administration,  fesoterodine  is  rapidly  and 
extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite SPM 7605. 
Hepatic  metabolism  and  renal  excretion  contribute  significantly  to  the  elimination  of  SPM  7605 
Clearance of SPM 7605 was approximately 42 L/h after i.v. administration. The mean terminal half-
life was approximately 4-4.5 hours after i.v. administration and 6-9 hours after administration of the 
prolonged release formulation. This suggests an absorption-rate limited elimination for the prolonged 
release  formulation.  SPM  7605  is  metabolized  to  its  carboxy  (SPM  5509),  carboxy-N-desisopropyl 
(SPM 7790) and N-desisopropyl metabolite (SPM 7789). 
The data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism, but are probably not the 
only enzymes involved, possibly CYP2A6 can be involved in the formation of SPM 7789. SPM 5509 
is also formed in poor metabolisers,  indicating that there must be another enzyme other than CYP2D6 
that is able to catalyse this metabolic pathway. In vivo metabolite profiling was performed up to 96 
hours.  When  the  excretion  pattern  of  fesoterodine,  SPM  7605  and  subsequent  metabolites  was 
evaluated,  approximately  77  %  of  the  dose  after  oral  administration  and  85  and  86  %  after 
fesoterodine i.v. and SPM 7605 i.v. was recovered in urine and faeces. No biliary elimination seems to 
occur  because  almost  no  SPM  7605  is  found  in  faeces  after  i.v.  administration.  There  was  a  more 
extensive formation of SPM 5509, SPM 7789 and SPM 7790 after oral administration, indicating first-
pass  metabolism.  It  seems  that  an  almost  complete  absorption  occurs  (based  on  similar  urinary 
excretion  of  metabolites  SPM  5509,  7789  and  7790  after  oral  and  i.v.  administration),  however  it 
©EMEA 2007 
16/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
cannot be excluded that some metabolites are formed presystemically and then subsequently absorbed. 
The fraction of SPM 7605 excreted unchanged in urine after oral, fesoterodine i.v. and SPM 7605 i.v. 
was approximately 16 %, 27 % and 34% respectively. The presence of SPM 7605 in the faeces after 
oral administration but not after i.v. administration indicates intestinal hydrolysis.  
•  Target population 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  the  target  population  were  measured  in  two  Phase  2  (SP582  and 
SP668) and one Phase 3 (SP584) clinical trials.  
•  Special populations 
Exposure to SPM 7605 is approximately doubled in poor CYP2D6 metabolisers as compared to 
extensive metabolisers, while the terminal half-life of SPM 7605 is not changed in poor metabolisers. 
Exposure to the carboxy metabolite and to the carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite is decreased by 
approximately 50% as compared to extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers. 
Gender,  age  or  race  do  not  influence  the  PK  behaviour  of  fesoterodine.  In  subjects  with  moderate 
hepatic impairment the exposure to SPM 7605 was increased 2-fold after a single dose of fesoterodine. 
CYP2D6 function was the most affected with a subsequent decrease of the related metabolites.  The 
dose  of  fesoterodine  has  been  limited  to  4  mg  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment, fesoterodine is contraindicated. 
In  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  unbound  exposure  was  1.3,  1.5  and  1.8 
fold  higher  compared  to  healthy  extensive  metabolisers.  A  larger  effect  is  expected  in  patients  with 
CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser  status.  In  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  the  dose 
should therefore be increased from 4 to 8 mg with caution. In patients with severe renal impairment, 
the dose is restricted to 4 mg. 
Considering  the  risk  of  higher  exposure  associated  with  dose-dependent  side  effects  in  certain 
subpopulations such as CYP2D6 poor metabolisers and the absence of genotyping a starting on a dose 
of  4  mg  is  recommended.  The  dose  can  then  be  titrated  based  on  dose-dependent  side-effects  and 
needs  of  the  patient.  These  dosing  recommendations  are  reflected  in  the  SPC  (sections  4.2,  4.4  and 
4.5). The concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic or 
renal impairment is contra-indicated and mentioned in the SPC. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro data, it is likely that fesoterodine can inhibit CYP3A4 in the intestine, although the 
risk of a clinical significant interaction with midazolam and other substances with substantial intestinal 
CYP3A4 metabolism seems low. Some inhibition of CYP2B6 was found, however this is not expected 
to  give  rise  to  a  clinically  relevant  interaction  given  the  large  margin  between  inhibitory 
©EMEA 2007 
17/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations  found  in  vitro  and  plasma  levels  obtained.  No  relevant  inhibition  of  CYP2C8  or 
CYP2E1 was found. The weak inhibition P-gp by SPM 7605 and fesoterodine is not likely to have any 
clinical relevance. 
Concomitant  treatment  with  a  CYP3A4  inhibitor  resulted  in  a  2-fold  increase  of  exposure  to  SPM 
7605. Both extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolisers experienced similar increase. Potentially, up to a 
4-fold increase of exposure compared the standard recommended treatment might be expected.  
No interactions have been observed between fesoterodine and oral contraceptives. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Fesoterodine  displays  dose-proportional  pharmacokinetics  in  the  dose-range  from  4  to  12mg/day 
(SP565).  
There  are  no  indications  of  time  dependent  pharmacokinetics  .  No  accumulation  of  SPM  7605  was 
observed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
Binding  of  fesoterodine  and  several  of  its  in  vivo  metabolites  to  human  recombinant  muscarinic 
acetylcholine receptors (M1-M5) was investigated in competition binding experiments. There was no 
selectivity of SPM 7605 in binding to these receptors. Fesoterodine was at least 100-fold less potent. 
The carboxy metabolite (SPM 5509) and the N-desisopropyl metabolite (SPM 7833) showed uniform 
binding affinity to all muscarinic receptor subtypes as well, albeit with more than 50-fold and about 
20-  to  70-fold  lower  affinity  respectively  as  compared  to  SPM  7605.  The  carboxy-N-desisopropyl 
metabolite  (SPM  6923)  did  not  bind  to  any  of  the  muscarinic  receptors  up  to  a  concentration  of  1 
µmol/L. 
Neither  the  S-enantiomers  of  fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  nor  the  corresponding  racemates  have  a 
more  than  intermediate  level  of  binding  at  any  of  the  human  muscarinic  receptors.  Fesoterodine  or 
SPM  7605  do  not  show  specificity  to  other  receptors  (such  as    dopamine,  serotonin,  adrenaline, 
neuropeptide,  sigma)  or  ion-channels  tested  (eg,  sodium,  calcium,  chloride).  The  lack  of  selectivity 
was also seen in ex vivo tissue studies.  
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Two urodynamic studies were conducted: SP577 and SP668.  
SP577  was  a  preliminary  Phase  2  study  in  which  12  subjects  with  urodynamic  confirmed  detrusor 
instability were treated with the immediate release fesoterodine formulation (2 and 4 mg) for 4 weeks. 
The  volume  at  first  unstable  contraction  was  measured  as  the  primary  variable.  After  treatment  an 
increase  of  43.8  ml  and  81.5  ml  respectively  in  urinary  volume  were  measured.  Some  other 
urodynamic  parameters  showed  a  trend  of  improvement  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  small 
number  of  subjects  available,  the  IR  formulation  used,  the  high  variability  observed,  and  the  doses 
studied  (placed  in  the  lower  limit  of  the  dosage  range  finally  recommended)  provide  little  helpful 
information. 
SP668 study, also discussed below (dose response studies) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed 
dose trial, where 3 doses of fesoterodine (4, 8 and 12 mg) were tested. The study enrolled male and 
female patients (18 to 78 years of age inclusive) with symptoms or signs of overactive bladder with 
increased urinary frequency and urinary incontinence. Subjects were stratified into 2 balanced strata 
by the presence or absence of involuntary detrusor contraction as measured during the filling phase of 
baseline  cystometry.  A  second  urodynamic  assessment  was  made  only  in  patients  with  involuntary 
detrusor  contractions.  Changes  in  volume  at  first  involuntary  contraction,  in  volume  at  first  and  at 
strong desire to void, in maximum cystometric capacity and in compliance were measured.

18/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After 8 weeks of treatment an increase of bladder volumes was observed for fesoterodine groups with 
respect to placebo. Dose-dependent improvement was also noted for most of the volumes measured. 
The small size of the groups and the lack of a measurement in the group without urodynamic findings 
in cystometry limit the value of these results. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Fesoterodine  induced  a  decrease  in  saliva  volume,  mainly  when  doses  equal  or  higher  than  12  mg 
were  administered.  This  was  supported  by  the  patients’  view.  A  greater  decrease  was  reported  in 
elderly compared to young males after a single dose of 8 mg.  
Fesoterodine  showed  a  clear  trend  to  increase  the  residual  urinary  volume  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner. Maximum tolerated dose was considered 28 mg with a maximum of > 400 ml in one healthy 
volunteer.  After  a  single  dose  of  8  mg  elderly volunteers  experienced  a  greater  increase  than young 
subjects did. 
Heart  rates  increased  with  a  clear  dose-dependent  relationship.  Pupillary  reaction  was  also  affected; 
this  effect  was  more  remarkable  for  increasing  doses.  A  QT  study  was  conducted  in  healthy 
volunteers. The safety implications of these findings are discussed under Safety.  
In summary, fesoterodine (in fact SPM 7605) exerted the expected urodynamic action. According its 
PD profile, negative effects in urinary retention, dryness of mouth and blurred vision were revealed. 
These findings were more evident for the highest doses and the elderly population.  
Coadministration  of  fesoterodine  with  other  antimuscarinic  agents  may  increase  the  anticholinergic 
pharmacological  actions  and  result  in,  increasing  frequency  or  severity  of  dry  mouth,  constipation, 
urinary retention and other anticholinergic pharmacological side effects, and coadministration should 
therefore be avoided. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.5). 
Clinical efficacy  
•  Dose response studies 
The Phase 2 program started with study SP577, a Phase IIa pilot trial that investigated the effects of 
fesoterodine Immediate release (IR) formulation 2mg and 4mg twice daily on urodynamic parameters 
in 12 female subjects with OAB. The urodynamic effect on the volume at first involuntary contraction 
and bladder capacity were assessed. 
Study subjects had a mean ages of 60 years and had symptoms of bladder overactivity and confirmed 
detrusor instability (>10 cmH2O) at urodynamic visit 1. 
Study  result  showed  that  administration  of  fesoterodine  immediate  release  2  or  4mg  increased  the 
volume at first involuntary contraction and bladder capacity in a dose dependent manner.  
The improvement was comparable to results shown with other antimuscarinic compounds. 
The Phase 2a pilot trial was followed by two double-blind, dose-defining trials using a slow release 
formulation (SR), study SP582 and study SP668.

Methods 
These  studies  enrolled  male  or  female  subjects  (18  to  78  years  of  age  inclusive)  with  symptoms  or 
signs  of  overactive  bladder  with  increased  urinary  frequency  and  urinary  incontinence.  Most  of  the 
subjects  randomised  to  double-blind  treatment  in  these  Phase  2  trials  were  female:  85%  in  SP582 
(FAS) and 87% in SP668 (FAS). The trial populations were primarily Caucasian (81% to 99%). Ages 
ranged  from  a  minimum  of  18  years  to  a  maximum  of  79  years  and  were  similar  between  trials; 
median  ages  overall  ranged  from  55  to  57  years.  Demographic  and  Baseline  characteristics  were 
generally  similar  among  treatment  groups  within  each  of  these  trials.  Patients  included  in  SP668 
seemed  more  affected.  Higher  percentage  of  subjects  reported  both  prior  and  concomitant  diseases 
although  only  16%  of  patients  enrolled  in  SP668  vs  64%  of  subjects  in  SP582  had  at  least  1  prior 
medication. 
In  both  trials,  there  was  a  considerable  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  OAB  (4  years  in  SP582  and  6 
years in SP668 ). About one third of patients included in both trials (31% in SP582 and 28% in SP668) 
had received prior treatment for the condition, mainly with oxybutynin and tolterodine.  
The  selection  criteria  for  SP582  and  SP668  were  common  in  most  aspects,  but  in  SP668  patients 
underwent  a  new  urodynamic  examination  at  Baseline.  It  results  in  a  rather  heterogeneous  Phase  2 
population  composed  of  patients  with  “at  least  1  involuntary  detrusor  contraction  in  a  urodynamic 
examination  in  the  prior  year  (SP582  subjects),  patients  with  documented  detrusor  contractions  at 
baseline  in  a  standardised  cystometry  (SP668  Stratum  A  subjects)  and  patients  with  documented 
normal urodynamic findings (SP668 Stratum B subjects).    
No  pre-specified  degree  of  severity  was  required.  Subjects  included  had  baseline  mean  of  11  to  12 
micturitions  per  24  hours.  The  baseline  mean  number  of  incontinence  episodes  was  more  variable, 
ranging  from  17  to  24  episodes  per  week.  Regarding  incontinence,  the  population  included  can  be 
considered in general as of moderate severity.

(change  in  average  number  of  urge  incontinence  episodes  per  week)  with  statistical  significance 
achieved in the fesoterodine 12mg group.  
A dose related increase of most of bladder volumes was observed after 8 week treatment. Fesoterodine 
appears to exert a more defining effect in the urodynamic setting than in symptomatic one. 
In conclusion, phase 2 studies are consistent in finding a statistically significant greater response for 
fesoterodine  groups  than  for  placebo  in  terms  of  reduction  of  frequency  of  micturitions  and 
incontinence episodes. The dose-response relationship is apparent in the range 4-8 mg, getting almost 
flat beyond that. This holds especially true regarding incontinence episodes. Due to the limited sample 
size of study SP668, no firm conclusions can be drawn on a differential clinical effect of fesoterodine 
depending on the baseline urodynamic findings. 
•  Main studies  
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  fesoterodine  in  the  treatment  of  OAB  has  been  studied  in  2  randomised, 
placebo-controlled, fixed dose Phase 3 trials (Studies SP583 and SP584). 
The doses studied in the Phase 3 program included fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg once daily (od). The 
active comparator used was tolterodine 4mg od. 
The following table presents an overview of the Phase 3 trials conducted using an SR formulation 
of fesoterodine in subjects with OAB.

METHODS 
SP583  and  SP584  were  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  and  12  weeks 
treatment  duration  studies.  SP583  was  carried  out  in  Europe,  South  Africa,  Australia,  and  New 
Zealand and SP584 was carried out in the US.  
The duration of the trial per subject was approximately 16 weeks: a 2-week placebo run-in period, a 
12-week double-blind treatment period, and a 2-week safety follow-up period.  
Study Participants  
Subjects were to be males and females ≥18 years of age with 
- 
symptoms or signs of OAB syndrome (known from medical history) and are expected to exhibit 
them at the specified level during the run-in period:  
o  urinary urgency: at least 6 (later amended to 3) urinary urgency episodes documented during 
the 3-day diary period. 
o  increased  micturition  frequency  (with/without  incontinence,  for  at  least  6  months  before 
enrollment):  at  least  8  micturitions  per  24  hours  confirmed  on  each  day  of  the  3-day  diary 
period. 
o  urinary  urge  incontinence  (for  at  least  1  month  before  enrolment):  at  least  3  urinary  urge 
incontinence episodes documented during the 3-day diary period.  
- 
- 
subject has documented the voided volume for 1 complete day during the 3-day diary period  
subject  has  documented  (based  on  Likert  scale),  that  his/her  condition  causes  him/her  at  least 
moderate problems. 
Patients with prior treatments with drug or non-drug treatment for OAB, amantadine, class Ia and III 
antiarrhythmic drugs and those who had any known neurological disease influencing bladder function, 
lower urinary tract pathology, a residual urine volume > 100 mL or clinically relevant bladder outlet 
obstruction  or  had  predominantly  symptoms  of  stress  incontinence  were  not  eligible  for  pivotal 
studies. 
A relevant Protocol Amendment (dated 26 Apr 2004) included revisions to 2 inclusion criteria to add 
subjects  with  urinary  urge  incontinence  at  Baseline  known  from  medical  history  and  to  include 
subjects with at least 3 urinary urge incontinence episodes documented during the 3-day diary period. 
The option to have “at least 6 urinary urgency episodes” instead of the documented urge incontinence 
episodes was eliminated.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomised to placebo, fesoterodine 4mg/day, and fesoterodine 8mg/day. In addition to 
a placebo control, SP583 also included an active control, tolterodine SR (4 mg once daily).  
Objectives 
The objective of the trial was to investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of fesoterodine 
©EMEA 2007

as compared to placebo and active control in subjects with OAB.  
SP584  also  included  genotyping  for  assessment  of  the  CYP2D6  metabolisation  status  (poor  vs 
extensive metabolizer) and a population pharmacokinetics analysis of SPM 7605, the active metabolite 
of fesoterodine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Both Phase 3 studies assessed the same primary efficacy variable: “Change in the average number of 
micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours after 12 weeks of treatment”. There were differences  between 
the co-primary efficacy variables between the Europe and US  
Co-primary variable for submission in Europe: ‘Treatment response derived from a treatment benefit 
scale after 12 weeks of treatment’. Subjects were asked to compare their present condition with their 
situation before the start of the trial: My condition has been: 1=greatly improved, 2=improved, 3=not 
changed, 4=worsened, during treatment. The treatment response was set to ‘YES’ if the category on 
the Treatment Benefit Scale was ‘1’ or ‘2’ and to ‘NO’ if the category on the scale was ‘3’ or ‘4’. 
Co-primary  variable  for  submission  in  the  US:  Change  in  average  number  of  urge  incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours (from baseline to value after 12 weeks of treatment). 
Therefore three primary/co-primary endpoints were used in both pivotal trials. 
Secondary  endpoints  in  both  phase  3  trials  included  (but  were  not  limited  to)  number  of  continent 
days per week, voided volume per micturition. 
Health  outcome  variables  included  the  change  in  the  subject’s  evaluation  of  quality  of  life  using 
2 validated questionnaires: the King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the International Consultation 
on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF).  
Randomisation/Blinding (masking) 
The randomization procedure anticipated a balancing of treatments (1:1:1:1 for placebo; fesoterodine 
4mg/day, fesoterodine 8mg/day, tolterodine 4mg/day) across countries and sites. 
Placebo  tablets  were  identical  in  appearance  (size  and  color)  to  fesoterodine  4mg  and  8mg  tablets. 
Placebo  capsules  (encapsulated)  were  identical  in  appearance  to  encapsulated  tolterodine  4mg 
capsules  (encapsulated)  given  orally  once  daily.  In  addition,  all  accompanying  packaging  was 
identical in appearance. Blinding was maintained by inclusion of matching placebos for the non-active 
dosage forms (double dummy design). 
Statistical methods/Sample size 
Six analysis sets were defined: 
o  Screened Set (SCS): The subjects who had signed an informed consent and completed a Visit 
1 assessment. 
o  Enrolled  Set  (ES):  The  ES  included  those  subjects  from  the  SCS  who  entered  the  Run-In 
Period (obtained at least 1 dose of placebo). 
o  Randomized Set (RS): The RS included all subjects randomized in the trial. 
o  Safety Set (SS): The SS defined all subjects who took at least 1 dose of trial medication after 
randomization. 
o  Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS consists of all subjects in the SS, who had at least 1 valid 
post-Baseline efficacy measurement. 
o  Per Protocol Set (PPS): An analysis was carried out excluding subjects from the FAS who had 
major  protocol  deviations  (determined  during  blind  data  review)  and/or  with  duration  of 
double-blind treatment shorter than 2 weeks. 
The primary analysis set for efficacy in all statistical analyses was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The 
measurements  of  the  continuous  primary  and  secondary  variables  prior  to  first  administration  of  the 
trial medication were used as Baseline measurements. The measurements in the last completed valid 
diary of the Double-Blind Treatment Period were used as endpoint values.

Statistical  analyses  for  the  primary  variables  of  micturition  and  urge  incontinence  were  performed 
using  standard  ANCOVA  techniques  including  treatment  and  country/region  as  factors  and  baseline 
value  as  a  covariate.  Treatment  response  was  analyzed  using  asymptotic  normal  approximation 
methodology. A sequentially rejective closed-test procedure was applied. 
The imputed endpoint values from the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method to account for 
the  missing  values  for  early  dropouts  were  used  in  the  primary  analysis.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was 
conducted based on observed cases (eg, missing values were not imputed). The ANCOVA results at 
the end of treatment (LOCF) among subjects who dropped out of the trial early are also presented for 
an  exploratory  comparison  with  trial  completers.  Further,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  by 
removing extreme outliers from the FAS. During the blinded data review meeting for SP583, it was 
decided  to  remove  extreme  outliers  from  the  FAS  and  to  perform  a  sensitivity  analysis.  The  same 
criteria  for  this  sensitivity  analysis  were  used  for  SP584  as  a  post-hoc  analysis.  Further,  a  non-
parametric sensitivity analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
The following is a brief summary of the statistical analysis for the primary variables for the 2 regions. 
Both hierarchical testing procedures for the primary variables are considered closed-testing procedures 
that preserve the multiple alpha level without adjustment of the nominal significance level.

SP 583: 264 (19%) of enrolled subjects were prematurely withdrawn from the trial as run-in failures. 
The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  from  the  Screening  and  Placebo  Run-In  Periods  was 
ineligibility to continue trial (185/1463; 13%). 
SP  584:  751  (40%)  of  screened  subjects  were  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  trial.  The  most 
common reason for discontinuation was ineligibility to continue in the trial (590/1886; 31%). 
Most subjects (≥80% in any treatment group) completed the full 12 weeks of treatment in both studies  
Conduct of the studies 
During  the  double  blind  treatment  period,  96%  to  100%  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were 
compliant with respect to trial medication. 
A  slight  increased  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  with  higher  doses  of  fesoterodine  was 
observed.  
Baseline data 
About  80%  of  the  subjects  were  female  and  20%  were  male  subjects.  The  trial  population  was 
primarily white. Ages ranged from 19 years to 91 years (mean 58 years). A total of 33% of patients 
were ≥65 years of age and 11% were ≥75 years of age. 
The population was largely made up of subjects with long-term, established diagnosis of OAB.  
Baseline  micturition  frequency  and  incontinence  episodes  somewhat  representing  severity  of  OAB, 
were comparable between the different treatment groups. 
Subjects in each treatment group had Baseline means of about 12 to 13 micturitions per 24 hours and 4 
urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours. Notable is the wide range of micturition frequency. However 
the numbers are comparable between groups. 
At  least  three  quarters  (75%  to  85%)  of  the  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  incontinent  at 
baseline. 
Demographic  characteristics  regarding  age,  gender,  concomitant  diseases  and  therapies  and  prior 
treatment  for  OAB  were  comparable  across  the  4  treatment  groups  and  the  trial  population  is 
representative for patients with OAB. 
Numbers analysed 
SP 583: the Full Analysis Set (FAS) included a total of 1103 subjects. A total of 6% to 8% of subjects 
had LOCF imputations for the change in number of micturitions per 24 hours, 4% to 7% had LOCF 
imputations for the change in number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and 9% to 13% had 
LOCF imputations for response on the treatment benefit scale. A total of 87% to 91% of subjects in 
each treatment group completed double-blind treatment. 
SP  584:  the  FAS  included  a  total  of  800  subjects;  a  total  of  11%  to  16%  of  subjects  had  LOCF 
imputations  for  the  change  in  number  of  micturitions  per  24  hours,  11%  to  15%  had  LOCF 
imputations  for  the  change  in  number  of  urge incontinence  episodes  per  24  hours,  and  15%  to  18% 
had LOCF imputations for response on the treatment benefit scale. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
Both pivotal studies (SP 583 and SP 584) where fesoterodine was tested at fixed dose demonstrated a 
statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  3  principal  variables  (number  of  micturitions  in  24  hours, 
number of urge incontinence episodes in 24 hours, and treatment response).

Both fesoterodine doses (4 and 8mg/day) showed statistically significant improvement over placebo at 
the end of treatment for the micturition and urge incontinence variables (US FDA analysis) and for the 
micturition and treatment response variables (EU analysis). 
Secondary endpoints 
Most  symptoms  related  secondary  variables  also  showed  statistically  significant  difference  from  the 
baseline after 12 weeks treatment, with numerically better results for highest dose (8 mg/day). 
Fesoterodine improved the signs and symptoms of OAB for all secondary endpoints in a comparable 
manner for both studies. A summary table for study SP 583 is given below:

Baseline scores in both pivotal studies were similar. Only one of the 9 domains, Impact of life scored 
over 50 points at baseline. No formal comparison was carried out. It has been suggested that a change 
of  5  or  more  points  can  be  considered  a  clinical  meaningful  improvement,  difference  questioned  by 
others.  Assessing  the  changes  from  baseline  with  respect  to  placebo  for  the  dosage  finally  chosen 
(4 mg) five out of 9 domains in Study SP583 and none in Study 584 reached the 5-minimal difference 
points.  Regarding  fesoterodine  8  mg  dose  7  and  6  domains  in  each  pivotal  study  scored  at  least  5 
points more than placebo did. 
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Methods 
Efficacy  data  from  the  double-blind  pivotal  trials  SP583  and  SP584  were  pooled  (Pool  E1)  to 
investigate  selected  subgroups.  Efficacy  in  subsets  of  the  population  was  evaluated  in  each  of  the 
primary  trials  (SP583  and  SP584).  Assignment  of  subjects  to  treatment  groups  followed  the  
trial-specific rules, ie, pooled analysis of efficacy data was performed as randomized on the basis of 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
Results 
Elderly  patients  (≥65  years)  experienced  a  lower  reduction  of  micturitions  and  patient  reported 
response  than  younger  subjects.  On  the  contrary,  a  greater  reduction  in  incontinence  episodes  was 
observed in that group, potentially related to a higher baseline rate in this subgroup. 
Non-white  subjects  showed  a  lower  reduction  of  incontinence  episodes  as  well  as  some  greater 
response  in  incontinence episodes.  However  the  under-representation  of  non-Caucasian  subjects  and 
the higher variability do not allow  conclusions to be drawn in this regard.  
A higher placebo effect for the different endpoints is observed amongst naïve patients, which may be 
responsible of the observed differences in response. However, the differential effect from placebo is 
essentially similar. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
No  specific  efficacy  studies  in  special  populations  have  been  performed.  However,  characteristics 
such as age, gender, race and prior drug treatment have been analysed in the pivotal trials. 
•  Supportive studies 
Long-Term Exposure Trials: Sp669, Sp738, Sp739 
Subjects who completed the pivotal phase 3 studies SP583 or SP584 and the phase 2 study SP668 had 
the option to participate in long-term extension trials and receive fesoterodine up to 3 additional years 
to further evaluate its efficacy and safety. (ongoing studies)

Patients enrolled were treated with fesoterodine 8 mg/day (with the option to decrease to 4mg/day), 
regardless of the treatment received during the previous double-blind phase (placebo, fesoterodine 4 
mg or fesoterodine 8 mg). 
Conclusions on efficacy from supportive studies are difficult to draw due to the lack of control and to 
the high number of drop-outs. At the time of the data cut-off only 665 out of 1144 patients enrolled in 
OL treatment remained. A randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal study (as recommended on the 
CHMP guideline) would have been preferable in order to better check possible loss of efficacy. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Both pivotal studies (SP583 and SP584) where fesoterodine was tested at fixed dose, demonstrated a 
statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  principal  variables  (number  of  micturitions  in  24  hours,  
‘treatment  response’).  For  the  variable  “treatment  response”  both  fesoterodine  4mg  (63;  74%)  and 
fesoterodine  8mg  (74;  79%)  doses  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  over  placebo  (45-
53%) at end of treatment, implying that a number of patients can expect benefit from the treatment. 
However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the patient perceived quality of treatment based on 
the scales used. 
 Globally considered, the effect of fesoterodine has consistently shown to be superior to placebo.  
The  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  is  modest  and  the  placebo  effect  is  large,  especially  the 
treatment difference for the fesoterodine 4 mg dose is rather small. Importantly however, the effect has 
been demonstrated to be about the same magnitude as for an acceptable comparator. 
It  is  not  possible  to  assess  whether  there  is  a  clinically  relevant  treatment  effect  after  2  weeks 
treatment. The full treatment effect appears to be observed between 2 to 8 weeks post-treatment. This 
is reflected in the SPC (section 4.2). 
The results in secondary endpoints support the result for primary endpoint and indicate that there is a 
clinically relevant treatment difference between active and placebo groups. 
Most  symptoms-related  secondary  variables  also  showed  statistically  significant  difference  from  the 
baseline after 12 weeks treatment, with numerically better results for highest dose (8 mg/day).  
As key secondary endpoints, HRQoL scales were used: KHQ (King’s Health Questionnaire) and ICQ-
SF (Incontinence Questionnaire- Short Form) both of them standard for these type of studies.

A small but consistent effect on quality of life as assessed by the King’s Health Questionnaire in the 
fesoterodine  was  shown  in  pivotal  trials.  This  is  a  disease-specific  health-related  validated 
questionnaire generally used. 
As with other drugs intended for the same condition the remaining question is how this results can be 
translates into a perceivable benefit for the patient. 
Clinical safety 
Five safety pools have been provided to assess fesoterodine safety (Pool S1, Pool S2, Pool S3, Pool S4 
and Pool S5). 
In  addition,  an  analysis  pool  (Pool  P1) has  been  used  to  assess  demographic  and  drug  exposure  for 
subjects participating in Phase I trials. 
Since the results from the different safety pools can be regarded as fully consistent, the assessment has 
mainly focussed on pools S1 and S2, which are thought to provide a detailed description of the short 
and long term safety profiles of fesoterodine   
•  Patient exposure 
Overall, 2859 patients were included in double blind controlled clinical trials, of whom, 780 received 
placebo,  290  tolterodine  and  1789  were  treated  with  fesoterodine  (782  with  4  mg/d;  785  with  8 
mg/day  and  222  with  12  mg/day).  The  double  blind  phase  of  these  studies  was  in  most  cases  12 
weeks.  
One  thousand  and  fifty  five  patients  entered  the  open  label  extensions  from  controlled  trials,  all  of 
them being initially treated with 8 mg/day of fesoterodine. Mean treatment duration was 13.5 months 
(including the 8-12 week double blind phase). During OL period 20% (206/1055) subjects reduced the 
dose from fesoterodine 8mg/day to 4mg/day. Among these 173/1055 (16%) remained on 4mg/day and 
33/1055 (3%) were again up titrated to 8mg/day. 
Regarding the subject disposition within the different safety pools,  the following should be considered  
©EMEA 2007

In pool S1, overall, 2859 subjects were treated with trial medication. Of these, 442 (16%) discontinued 
trial  medication  prematurely.  The  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  AE 
(5%), withdrawal of consent (3%), and protocol violation (3%). 
Of the 1055 subjects included in Pool S2 (OL only), 390 (37%) discontinued treatment prematurely. 
The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  OL  treatment  in  Pool  S2  were  adverse  event 
(117/1055: 11%), withdrawal of consent (99/1055: 9%), and lack of efficacy (97/1055: 9%). 
•  Adverse events  
Adverse events from primary safety trials 
Overall, in Pool S1, AEs from any system organ class were reported by 50% of subjects in the placebo 
(390/780) and tolterodine 4mg/day (144/290) groups, and by 60% (465/782), 64% (500/785) and 73% 
(163/222) of subjects in the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively. 
Common adverse events: 
The  following  table  provided  the  treatment-emergent  AEs  reported  by  ≥2%  of  subjects  in  any 
fesoterodine  group  in  Pool  S1  (sorted  in  descending  frequency  by  fesoterodine  8mg/day,  then 
fesoterodine 4mg/day, then placebo).

group (Pool S1). 
©EMEA 2007 
33/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the majority of adverse events the occurrence rate was equal to or less than placebo at 4 mg and  
8 mg fesoterodine, the doses approved for clinical use, and more common than placebo at the higher 
12 mg fesoterodine dose not intended for clinical use. A dose-dependent increase in dry mouth and dry 
throat were observed in the fesoterodine treatment groups. 
Except  for  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  back  pain,  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  AEs  were 
reported  more  often  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  than  in  the  fesoterodine  4  or  8mg/day  treatment 
groups. 
Subjects  with  urinary  retention  were  considered  in  6  (<1%),  8  (<1%),  and  3  (1%)  subjects  in  the 
fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively. There were no cases of urinary retention in the 
tolterodine  4mg/day  group,  and  a  single  case  in  the  placebo  group.  Residual  urine  volume  and 
micturition  disorder  were  reported  each  in  1  (<1%) and  2  (<1%)  subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  4,  and 
©EMEA 2007 
34/48 
 
 
 
 
 
12mg/day  groups  and  three  subjects  reported  residual  urine  volume  in  the  fesoterodine  8mg/day 
group. No subjects reported residual urine volume and micturition for placebo and tolterodine groups. 
In  addition,  no  subjects  reported  micturition  disorder  fesoterodine  8mg/day.  (see  residual  urine  and 
safety in special population sections). 
Of the subjects reporting AEs during double-blind treatment in Pool S1, 121/381 (32%) subjects in the 
placebo group, 161/458 (35%) subjects in the fesoterodine 4mg/day group, 193/489 (39%) subjects in 
the  fesoterodine  8mg/day  group,  66/163  (40%)  subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  group,  and 
49/139 (35%) subjects in the tolterodine 4mg/day group had ongoing AEs at the end of treatment. 
Adverse events from long-term safety data – Pool S2 
Overall, in Pool S2 (DB+OL), AEs from any system organ class were reported by 80% (843/1055) of 
subjects in total. For OL only, AEs were reported by 70% (734/1055) of subjects. 
Common adverse events: 
The table below shows the treatment emergent adverse events reported by ≥2% of subjects (Pool S2), 
sorted in descending order by DB+OL first, then by OL only. 
©EMEA 2007 
35/48 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events reported by ≥2% of subjects in Pool S2 were similar to those seen in Pool S1, with the 
exception of abdominal pain upper, asthenia, chest pain, dysgeusia, vision blurred, and nasal dryness 
which  did  not  meet  the  ≥2%  criteria,  and  the  addition  of  urinary  retention,  gastroesophageal  reflux 
disease, sinusitis, hypertension, and bronchitis, which did meet the ≥2% criteria for inclusion. Typical 
antimuscarinic AEs such as dry mouth occur early during treatment and are therefore included in the 
double-blind part of Pool S2. In addition, the DB+OL data in Pool S2 also contains data from SP668, 
which included the fesoterodine 12mg/day dose. 
Onset of drug-associated adverse events 
The majority of drug-associated AE had an onset occurring during the first month of treatment, with 
the frequency of new onset declining over time. However this was not true for urinary retention and 
gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) increase which did not show a clear pattern, with onset occurred 
after month 1. This reflected in the SPC (section 4.8).

Drug related adverse events 
Adverse  events  were  considered  to  be  drug  related  if  causality  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
highly probable, probable, possible or not assessable. 
In Pool S1 23%, 33%, 47% and 65% of subjects in placebo, fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups 
respectively  had  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug-related.  In  the  tolterodine  4mg/day 
group, 30% of subjects had an AE considered by the investigator to be drug related.

angina pectoris and chest pain by 5 subjects each, bronchitis and pneumonia by 4 subjects each and 
abdominal pain, ECG QT prolongation, QTc interval prolonged were reported by 3 subjects each.

Hepatobiliary disorders 
Less than 1% of subjects in any treatment group had hepatobiliary system disorder during treatment, 
aside  from  isolated  cases  of  transaminase  elevations.  Three  subjects  in  Pool  S1  had  hepatobiliary 
disorders that were SAE and led to treatment discontinuation. One case of hepato-cellular damage was 
considered highly related to fesoterodine treatment (8 mg) by the investigator. 
Death 
Five subjects died during the clinical program for fesoterodine and all were considered to be unrelated 
to fesoterodine treatment. 
•  Laboratory findings 
In  the  results  for  laboratory  testing  there  were  individual  cases  that  exceeded  the  normal  range  for 
individual laboratory parameters but overall, there were no clinically relevant trends or change from 
Baseline to end of treatment in mean values for any haematology, chemistry or urinalysis parameter in 
any of the treatment groups. 
Gamma-GT  increase  was  the  only  hepatic  lab  value  that  met  the  criteria  to  be  considered  drug 
associated e.g. had an incidence rate of at least 1% and occurring at least twice as often in any of the 
fesoterodine groups in comparison with the placebo group. 
Examination  of  individual  clinically-relevant  laboratory  abnormalities  showed  that  there  was  no 
clinically relevant pattern of laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal or 
SAE.  
•  Urinary retention  
Mean residual urine volume was influenced somewhat by gender, with small dose-dependent increases 
in both sexes, but this increase was more pronounced in men. 
Increase in mean residual urine were also larger in subjects >65 and >75 years of age, than younger 
subjects. 
Discontinuation  due  to  Urinary  retention:  most  cases  of  urinary  retention  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
intensity.  A  post-baseline  residual  urine  volume  >200  ml  was  a  protocol  defined  criterion  for 
discontinuation  and  discontinued  subjects  were  usually  reported  as  adverse  event  which  coded  to 
urinary retention.Urinary retention led to treatment discontinuation in 3 (<1%), 5 (<1%), and 2 (<1%) 
subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  4,  8  and  12  mg  group  respectively.  There  were  no  cases  of  urinary 
retention in the tolterodine 4mg/day group. 
For the overall study population mean change from baseline in residual urine volume was rather small. 
However  there  were  a  number  of  cases  reported  with  residual  urine  greater  than  200  mL  which  is 
considered highly clinically relevant. The results in the safety database indicate that urinary retention 
is slightly more pronounced in male subjects. This is mentioned in the SPC section 4.8. 
•  Vital signs and neurological observations 
Individual  clinically  relevant  vital  sign  abnormalities  show  slight  dose-dependent  trends  in  the 
fesoterodine  treatment  groups  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  increases  in  pulse  rate,  while  the 
proportions of subjects with changes in blood pressure were similar across treatment groups. 
This finding is compatible with the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. 
The  cognitive  function  was  not  specifically  tested.  With  the  exception  of  dizziness,  the  overall 
incidence of neurological adverse events was very low; amnesia, confusional state, and disorientation 
occurred in very few subjects. The incidence of adverse events related to cognitive function in phase 
2/3  trials  are  similar  between  fesoterodine  and  placebo  treatment.  In  pool  S1  the  reported  incidence 
related  to  cognitive  function  in  the  tolterodine  group  is  lower  compared  to  both  fesoterodine  and 
©EMEA 2007 
38/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo.  However,  psychiatric  disorders  (confusion,  hallucination)  and  nervous  system  disorders 
(dizziness and somnolence) are known antimuscarinic class effects. 
To  further  support  the  safety  of  fesoterodine  with  respect  to  cognitive  function,  a  specific 
Pharmacovigilance plan action is included in the Risk management plan. 
•  Cardiac safety 
Study SP686 (QT/QTc trial)  
Methods 
The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg/day on the QT interval was evaluated in a phase 1, double-
blind,  randomized,  placebo-  and  positive-controlled  (moxifloxacin  400mg/day)  parallel  group  trial 
with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 healthy male and female subjects aged 44 to 
65 years.  
Fesoterodine 28 mg/day was chosen because this dose results in an exposure to the active metabolite 
of fesoterodine that is higher than the exposure in poor CYP2D6 metabolizer receiving fesoterodine  
8 mg/day together with a maximum CYP3A4 blockade.  
The primary objective was to define the electrocardiographic effects of fesoterodine at steady-state 
after administration of 4 or 28mg/day for 3 days.  
As secondary objectives the correlation between fesoterodine plasma concentration and QTcF were 
examined. 
Eletrocardiographic  parameters  were  measured  over  a  24-hour  period  at  pre-dose,  after  the  first 
administration, and after the third administration of study medication.  
The primary endpoint was the following:  
Change from baseline in QTc based on Fridericia (QTcF) correction method.  
Secondary endpoints were the following:  
Electrocardiograms:  change  from  Baseline  in  QTc  based  on  individual  (QTcI)  and  Bazett  (QTcB) 
correction methods. Further secondary endpoint was change from Baseline in heart rate, PR interval, 
QRS interval, ECG morphological pattern and uncorrected QT interval 
Pharmacodynamics:  Correction  between  the  QTcF,  change  in  QTcF,  and  plasma  concentration  of 
SPM 7605 (the active metabolite of fesoterodine) 
Results  
ECG parameters were similar across treatment groups. The exception was for heart rate in which the 
number of subjects with an increase of >25% and>100bpm was higher in the fesoterodine treatment 
groups  (16.9%,  39.1%  and  76.5%  in  the  placebo,  4mg/day  and  28mg/day  fesoterodine  groups 
respectively) due to the pharmacological effect of anticholinergics to increase heart rate.

Electrocardiograms analysis in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials 
The  measurements  were  captured  in  a  similar  way  in  all  Phase  2  and  3  trials  using  a  central  ECG 
facility. 
The following table shows ECG findings over time for primary safety trials (Pools S1 and S5).

At the end of treatment in Pool S1, marginal mean increases (3-6bpm) in heart rate, consistent with the 
observed slight increase in pulse rate, were observed in subjects receiving fesoterodine and tolterodine 
compared  with  a  mean  increase  of  <1bpm  in  the  placebo  group.  Increased  heart  rate  is  a  known 
pharmacological effect of antimuscarinic drugs. 
Individual  changes  in  QTc  were  classified  as  observed  values  <450ms,  450  to  <480ms,  480  to 
<500ms, and ≥500ms. Changes from Baseline were classified as <30ms, 30 to <60ms, and ≥60ms. 
The following table summarizes change from Baseline at end of treatment in QTcF and QTcB results 
for Pool S1.

Change from Baseline ≥30ms in QTcF and QTcB at the end of treatment was generally similar across 
the  treatment  groups  in  both  Pool  S1  and  Pool  S5.  At  end  of  treatment  in  Pool  S1,  1  subject  in  the 
fesoterodine  8mg/day  group  had  a  ≥60ms  change  from  Baseline  in  QTcF  and  2  subjects  in  each 
fesoterodine treatment group had a ≥60ms change from Baseline in QTcB. Similar results were seen in 
Pool  S5  except  that  there  were  no  QTcB  changes  ≥60ms  in  the  fesoterodine  4mg/day  group.  There 
was  no  indication  of  an  increased  incidence  of  QTc  prolongation  with  increased  exposure  to 
fesoterodine over a 3-month period calculated by either formula. 
Overall,  change  from  Baseline  in  QTc  based  on  the  Fridericia  correction  method  did  not  show  any 
differences between the active treatment and placebo group. Since, QT prolongation was also seen in 
>5 subjects in the safety file for fesoterodine, the possibility of an increased risk for QT prolongation, 
associated with fesoterodine treatment, cannot be excluded. Therefore, as with other antimuscarinics, 
caution  is  given  in  the  SPC  (section  4.4)  for  patients  with  risk  for  QT-prolongation  (e.g. 
hypokalaemia,  bradycardia  and  concomitant  administration  of    medicines  known  to  prolong  QT 
interval) and relevant pre-existing cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, congestive 
heart failure). 
•  Safety in special populations 
Safety by gender and age 
In the treated study population 32% were older than 65 years and 9% were older than 75 years. 
Approximately  19  %  of  the  treated  study  population  was  men.  Mean  treatment  duration  was 
comparable in each treatment group regardless of gender.

There were some difference in AE pattern based on age, with constipation, urinary tract infection and 
dizziness  occurring  more  often  in  older  (>65  years  and  >75  years)  subjects.  Dry  mouth  was  more 
frequent in the fesoterodine 8mg/day group among subjects >75 years old than in those <75 (45% vs. 
34%, respectively). Headache was more common in younger subjects. 
Gender  appeared  to  play  a  role  in  the  frequency  of  some  AEs  including  dry  mouth  which  occurred 
more often in females.  
Safety in poor metabolizers for CYP2D6 
Poor metabolizers for CYP2D6 were more likely than extensive metabolizers to experience AEs such 
as those known to be associated with antimuscarinic treatment. This effect was  more pronounced in 
the  fesoterodine  8mg/day  group,  eg,  constipation,  dry  mouth,  dry  eye,  residual  urine  retention  and 
dyspepsia occurred more often in poor metabolizers. 
Regarding residual urine, results showed that there was a greater mean increase in poor metabolizers 
than extensive metabolizers. The most pronounced difference was in the fesoterodine 8mg/day group 
where  mean  increase  in  residual  urine  was  24mL  in  poor  metabilizers  and  14mL  in  extensive 
metabolizers.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  did  appear  to  influence  the  occurrence  of  some  AEs, 
particularly dry mouth, constipation, and dry throat which were reported more frequently by subjects 
who used CYP3A4 inhibitors than those who did not use them, and more often in each fesoterodine 
group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  During  open-label  treatment  dry  mouth  occurred  with  similar 
incidence in subjects who did not use CYP3A4 inhibitors, and those who did. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A  total  of  142  subjects  in  Pool  S1  discontinued  due  to  AEs  during  treatment:  26/780  (3%)  in  the 
placebo  group,  35/782  (5%),  45/785  (6%),  and  27/222  (12%)  subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  4,  8,  and 
12mg/day groups, respectively, and in 9/290 (3%) subjects in the tolterodine 4mg/day group. 
Other than dry mouth, there was no clear dose-dependent relationship between fesoterodine dose and 
frequency of discontinuations due to any particular AE. 
Adverse events led to discontinuation of fesoterodine in 11% of subjects during long-term treatment 
(Pool  S2),  and  were  typical  of  those  seen  during  treatment  with  antimuscarinics.  These  included  (in 
more than 2 subjects during open-label treatment) dry mouth in 16 (2%) subjects, urinary retention in 
10  (<1%)  subjects,  constipation  in  8  (<1%)  subjects,  residual  urine  volume  in  6  (<1%)  subjects, 
lacrimal disorder (dry eye) in 5 (<1%) subjects, and urinary tract infection, cough, dry throat, and dry 
skin in 3 (<1%) subjects each. This AE dropout profile is similar to that in Pool S1 with the addition of 
cough, dry skin, and residual urine volume (6 subjects, <1%) in Pool S2. 
Overall  12%  of  subjects  in  Pool  S2  had  their  dose  reduced  from  8mg  to  4mg  during  open-label 
treatment due to a treatment-emergent adverse event. Dry mouth in 91/1055 (9%) subjects was the AE 
most  often  leading  to  dose  reduction  during  OL  treatment.  This  was  followed  by  dysuria  and 
constipation,  leading  to  dose  reduction  in  8  (<1%)  subjects  each,  lacrimal  disorder  (dry  eye)  in  
7 (<1%) subjects, headache in 6 (<1%) subjects, dry skin in 4 (<1%) subjects, and urinary hesitation 
and  dry  throat  in  3  (<1%)  subjects  each.  The  majority  of  dose  reductions  occurred  during  the  first  
6 weeks of treatment.

•  Discussion on clinical safety 
Common  AEs  (Treatment  Emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  with  incidence  rate  of  at  least  2%  in  any 
fesoterodine group) that occurred more often in subjects treated with fesoterodine 4 and 8mg/day than 
placebo  included  (in  descending  order  based  on  the  4mg/day  dose  of  fesoterodine)  dry  mouth  22% 
(173/782),  headache  8%  (64/782);  constipation  4%  (28/782),  nasopharyngitis  4%  (28/782),  urinary 
tract  infection  3%  (26/782),  dyspepsia  2%  (12/782),  nausea  2%  (17/782),  dysuria  2%  (12/782),  and 
back pain 2% (19/782). 
The  AEs  profile  for  the  8  mg/d  dose  was  similar  to  the  above  described  with  a  numerically  higher 
incidence of dry mouth (35%). Except for urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and back pain, these 
AEs  were  reported  more  often  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  than  in  the  fesoterodine  4  or  8mg/day 
treatment  groups.  The  AEs  profile  for  tolterodine  was  similar  to  the  observed  for  the  4  mg/day  of 
fesoterodine, with a numerically lower incidence of dry mouth and headache.  
During the open label (OL) extensions (Pool S2) the profile of common AEs was generally similar to 
that listed above for Pool S1 (double blind treatment). 
Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity in Pool S1, and Pool S2 for both analyses. In Pool S1, 
severe AEs were reported for 4% (29/780), 5% (41/782), 8% (61/785), 14% (30/222), and 3% (8/290) 
of  subjects  in  the  placebo;  fesoterodine  4,  8,  and  12mg/day  groups;  and  tolterodine  4mg/day  group, 
respectively. Dry mouth was the AE most often rated as severe in intensity (<1%, <1%, 3%, 9%, and  
0  in  placebo;  fesoterodine  4,  8,  and  12mg/day;  and  tolterodine  4mg/day  group,  respectively).  Dry 
throat,  lacrimal  disorders  and  headache  were  also  reported  as  severe  AEs  in  ≥1%  subjects  in  the 
fesoterodine 12mg group. 
Drug-associated AEs were reported for any system organ class (SOC) by 23% (176/780) of subjects in 
the placebo group, 35% (271/782), 46% (359/785), and 64% (141/222) of subjects in the fesoterodine 
4,  8,  and  12mg/day  groups,  and  29%  (84/290)  of  subjects  in  the  tolterodine  4mg/day  group, 
respectively. Drug associated adverse events reported in ≥2% (in descending order based on incidence 
of adverse events in fesoterodine 8mg/day, followed by fesoterodine 4mg/day, followed by placebo) 
were dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, lachrymal disorder (dry eye), dry throat, dysuria, abdominal 
pain upper and back pain.  
First onset of drug associated adverse events occurred mostly during Month 1 of treatment, decreasing 
the incidence afterward. Urinary retention and GGT increased did not show the same pattern of onset. 
In  Pool  S1,  a  total  of  142/2859  (5%)  subjects  discontinued  clinical  trials  due  to  AEs  (3%  in  the 
placebo group, 5%, 6%, and 12% in the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively, and 3% 
subjects  in  the  tolterodine  4mg/day  group).  During  long-term  treatment,  adverse  events  led  to 
discontinuation  of  fesoterodine  in  11%  of  subjects.  Reasons  for  discontinuations  (each  of  them 
accounting for less than 1%) were dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, ECG corrected interval 
prolonged,  GGT  increased,  mucosal  dryness,  headache,  dyspepsia,  dry  throat,  nausea,  vertigo, 
dizziness, chest pain, lacrimal disorder, vomiting and vision blurred. There was a clear dose-dependent 
relationship between fesoterodine dose and frequency of discontinuations due to dry mouth rising to 
5%  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  group.  No  other  AE  showed  such  a  clear  dose  dependence 
relationship. 
Twelve  percent  (12%)  of  subjects  had  their  dose  reduced  from  8mg  to  4mg  during  open-label 
treatment due to TEAE. Dry mouth in 91/1055 (9%) subjects was the AE most often leading to dose 
reduction during OL treatment. The majority of dose reductions occurred during the first 6 weeks of 
treatment. 
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  were  reported  in  Pool  S1  by  2%  placebo  (15/780)  and  tolterodine 
(7/290)  treated  subjects,  27/782  (4%),  23/785  (3%),  and  13/222  (6%)  subjects  treated  with 
fesoterodine  4,  8,  and  12mg/day,  respectively.  During  open-label  treatment,  SAEs  were  reported  by 
92/1055 (9%) subjects treated with fesoterodine.

44/48 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAEs reported by more than 2 fesoterodine treated subjects included myocardial infarction reported by 
7 subjects, angina pectoris and chest pain by 5 subjects each, bronchitis and pneumonia, each reported 
by 4 subjects, and abdominal pain, ECG QT corrected interval prolonged, invertebral disc protrusion, 
breast cancer, appendicitis, and cholecystectomy reported by 3 subjects each (all <1%). 
Seventeen 17/1055 (2%) subjects discontinued treatment due to  SAE during OL. None of the SAEs 
reported in Pool S2 OL only, led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject. 
A thorough QT study in healthy volunteers was conducted. Fesoterodine up to 28 mg/d for 3 days was 
assessed.  A  placebo  and  positive  control  (moxifloxacine)  arms  were  included.  The  results  did  not 
show  fesoterodine  to  have  an  effect  on  the  QT  surpassing  the  established  threshold  of  regulatory 
concern (10 msec). These findings have been properly reflected in the SPC 
. 
These  results  are  apparently  confirmed  by  the  ECG  analysis  from  therapeutic  trials,  although  3 
subjects assigned to fesoterodine 4mg/day and 6 to fesoterodine 8 mg discontinued the study drug due 
to QT prolongations. Importantly, 3 patients on the 8 mg dose were reported to have a SAE related to 
QT prolongation. Further analysis revealed that the incidence rates of QTc >=500 ms post-baseline or 
QTc increase of >=60 ms (some of which were classified as SAEs), were similar in active and placebo 
groups: 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5% for fesoterodine 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and placebo, respectively. 
Mean changes from Baseline in residual urine volume were usually greater in males than in females 
and  greater  in  older  subjects  (≥65 years  and  ≥75 years)  compared  with younger  subjects  (<65 years 
and <75 years). A dose dependent increase in residual urine volume was observed in the fesoterodine 
treatment  groups.  Although  urinary  retention  is  compatible  with  the  antimuscarinic  activity,  results 
showed  a  numerically  higher  incidence  amongst  the  fesoterodine  treated  patients  than  tolterodine 
treated patients. 
Cognitive  function  is  known  to  be  possibly  affected  by  antimuscarinic  agents.  With  increasing 
incidence of urge incontinence with age, elderly patients are a relevant target population. Although the 
incidence  of  adverse  events  related  to  cognitive  function  was  low  and  not  different  from  placebo,  a 
specific pharmacovigilance plan action is included in the risk management plan. 
During  the  extension  clinical  trials,  patients  were  down-titrated  and  up-titrated  accordingly, 
apparently,  with  their  tolerability  to  treatment.  Moreover,  there  were  a  3%  of  subjects  who  were  
up-titrated again to the 8mg/day dosage. 
No relevant laboratory abnormalities has been reported for fesoterodine apart from isolated cases of 
raised liver enzymes determinations, in some cases leading to treatment discontinuation.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
The specific areas of monitoring for safety concerns are those mentioned in the above table. 
In summary, routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance will be employed. The applicant will provide 
reviews  of  AEs  associated  with  the  use  of  fesoterodine,  as  well  as  specific  reviews  of  QT 
prolongation/Torsades de Pointes, hepatic disorders, urinary retention, cognitive function impairment, 
and systematic analysis by age and gender of AEs. 
A  paediatric  development  program  is  being  designed  and  will  be  submitted  and  the  Agency  will  be

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Pharmacotoxicological  studies  have  shown  effects  in  relation  to  the  antimuscarinic  activity  of 
fesoterodine and its main metabolite (SPM 7605). 
Fesoterodine and SPM 7605 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 
values of 3.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. However in conscious dogs, the active metabolite had no effect 
on the QT interval and QTc interval at plasma exposures more than 20-fold higher than the mean peak 
free plasma concentration in humans. 
The main target organ of toxicity was the liver in rats. No target organ of toxicity was identified in the 
mouse or the dog.  
Fesoterodine is non-genotoxic and non-carcinogenic 
. 
Reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryotoxicity  at  doses  close  to  maternally  toxic  ones 
(increased number of resorptions, pre-implantation and post-implantation losses). 
Environmental  studies  including  chronic  ecotoxicity  tests  of  the  active  metabolite  SPM  7605  in 
aquatic  organisms  of  at  least  three  trophic  levels,  are  ongoing  and  will  be  completed  in  the  
post-authorisation phase. (Follow-up measure) 
Efficacy 
The  demonstration  of  the  clinical  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  is  based  on  2  pivotal  trials  in  which  the 
doses of 4 and 8 mg/d have been compared to placebo and tolterodine. The clinical efficacy results are 
statistically significantly superior to placebo in all primary endpoints i.e. reduction in the number of 
micturitions  per  24 hours,  of  urge  incontinence  episodes  per  24 hours  and  improvement  of  the 
treatment response rate using a treatment benefit scale.  
The  efficacy  results  for  fesoterodine  4mg/day  and  the  active  comparator  tolterodine  are  judged 
comparable whereas the efficacy for fesoterodine 8mg/day was more pronounced. 
For the overall patient group, the clinical relevance for the efficacy differences between the different 
doses of fesoterodine is difficult to assess, but the slightly better treatment effect of the higher dose of 
8mg/day, may imply some benefit for the individual patient. 
Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  in  overactive  bladder  syndrome, 
though  modest,  has  been  reasonably  and  consistently  established  both  against  placebo  and  an 
acceptable active comparator with a similar mechanism of action. 
Safety 
The  safety  profile  of  fesoterodine  is  the  one  expected  for  an  antimuscarinic  drug.  No  major  safety 
concerns  have  been  identified,  although  a  numerically  higher  incidence  and  severity  of  some 
anticholinergic AEs as compared with tolterodine were observed. 
No evidence from a QT prolonging effect is apparent from either a specific QT study or in depth ECG 
analysis from phase II and III data. However, some QT-related AEs have been reported, especially for 
the 8 mg dose. This is reflected in the SPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics

•  User consultation 
The readability of the package leaflet for fesoterodine was tested based on the method for user testing 
described in the Readability Guideline. The outcome was satisfactory in accordance with predefined 
success criteria. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The  demonstration  of  the  clinical  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  is  based  on  2  pivotal  trials  in  which  the 
doses of 4 and 8 mg/d have been compared to placebo and tolterodine. Globally considered, the effect 
of fesoterodine has been consistently shown to be superior to placebo. Importantly, the magnitude of 
such effect has been demonstrated to be about the same magnitude of an acceptable comparator. For 
the overall patient group, the clinical relevance for the efficacy differences between the different doses 
of  fesoterodine  is  difficult  to  assess,  but  the  slightly  better  treatment  effect  of  the  higher  dose  of 
8mg/day,  may  imply  some  benefit  for  the  individual  patient.  Therefore,  and  fully  recognising  the 
above mentioned limitations, the efficacy of fesoterodine in the intended indication can be considered 
as reasonably established. 
Fesoterodine presents a clinical safety profile fully compatible with its antimuscarinic activity. There 
was an evident dose relationship for the incidence of some clinical AEs, with a slightly numerically 
higher  incidence  amongst  fesoterodine  4  and  8  mg  treated  patients  than  with  tolterodine.  No 
outstanding safety concerns are apparent from the assessment of submitted data. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
Safety  issues  have  been  properly  taken  into  consideration  in  the  revised  risk  management  plan: 
cardiovascular safety, liver toxicity, urinary retention and cognitive function impairment. 
(cid:131)  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  TOVIAZ  (fesoterodine)  in  “Treatment  of  the  symptoms 
(increased urinary frequency and/or urgency and/or urgency incontinence) that may occur in patients 
with  overactive  bladder  syndrome”  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation.

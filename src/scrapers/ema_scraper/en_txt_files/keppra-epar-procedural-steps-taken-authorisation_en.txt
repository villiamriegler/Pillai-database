Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 26 February 1999. 
Following a request from the Rapporteur a clock-stop for a GLP inspection was agreed by the 
CPMP on 22 April 1999. The inspection was carried out at one of the preclinical investigation 
sites in the UK on 19-27 May 1999. On 30 July 1999, after receiving the final UK Inspection 
Report, the CPMP agreed  that  the  audit issues had  not been  entirely resolved  and requested a 
further  GLP  inspection  at  the  site  of  the  preclinical  analyses  in  Belgium.  Following  the  final 
GLP inspection report, the clock was restarted on 24 September 1999. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  8  October 
1999.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  5 
October 1999. 
During  the  meeting  on  16-18  November  1999  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of 
questions  to  be  sent  to  the  applicant.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the 
applicant on 18 November 1999. 
The applicant submitted the responses to the CPMP consolidated list of questions on 28 March 
2000 and 19 June 2000. 
The Rapporteur circulated the response assessment report on the applicant’s responses to the list 
of questions to all CPMP Members on 12 May 2000 and a complementary assessment report on 
21 June 2000. 
During the meeting held 27-29 June 2000 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted 
and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
Marketing Authorisation to Keppra on 29 June 2000.  The European Commission adopted the 
corresponding decision on 29 September 2000.

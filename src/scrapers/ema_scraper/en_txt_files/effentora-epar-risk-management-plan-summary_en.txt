Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Effentora® (FENTANYL) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Effentora® (fentanyl) (herein after 
also referred to as Fentanyl). The RMP details important risks of Fentanyl, how these risks can 
be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Fentanyl's risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the Package Leaflet for Fentanyl provide 
essential information to physicians, pharmacists and patients on how Fentanyl should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Fentanyl should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Fentanyl's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
Effentora® (fentanyl) is authorised for the treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in adults with 
cancer who are already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain (see SmPC 
for the full indication). It contains Fentanyl as the active substance and it is given by 
transmucosal (buccal) route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Effentora®’s benefits can be found in Effentora®’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/effentora. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Fentanyl, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Fentanyl’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Fentanyl, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Effentora® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Fentanyl are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Fentanyl. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Post- marketing data/studies, PSUR, and external medical research publications. 
A population of patients at increased risk of abuse, misuse, diversion, 
pharmacodependence, or addiction may be characterised. Relevant studies highlight 
risk factors for dependence, characterised as current or life-time dependence. Factors 
common to both categories include a history of opioid abuse, mental disorders, 
younger age and smoking. For life-time opioid dependence, there are additional risk 
factors, such as greater number of opioid orders, and history of anti-social personality. 
For current opioid dependence, additional risk factors are a history of depression and 
current psychotropic medication use.

current psychotropic medication use.  
It should be noted that it may be inherently difficult to differentiate fentanyl-related 
pharmacodependence from that which is attributable to the background opioid therapy.  
The risk of pharmacodependence may be increased due to the length of treatment.

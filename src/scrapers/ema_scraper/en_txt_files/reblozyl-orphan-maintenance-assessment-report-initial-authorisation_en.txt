1.  Introductory comment 
The approved therapeutic indication encompasses –and lies completely within- two distinct medical 
entities, for which the sponsor has been granted two separate orphan designations: beta thalassemia 
(intermedia and major) and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
The maintenance of the criteria for orphan designation are discussed separately for each orphan 
condition, in sections 2 and 3 below.

2.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2014 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB 
linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain  was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data 
showing haemoglobin increase in non-transfusion dependent patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the severe anaemia, the need 
for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these, in particular in beta- thalassaemia 
major patients; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 people in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the 
medicinal product containing recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain of human Activin Receptor IIB linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain may be of 
significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical 
data showing that treatment of patients with the product may improve anaemia, which is a 
different aspect to the target of the iron chelation products authorised. The Committee considered 
that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.

2.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Beta thalassaemia is characterised by a genetic deficiency in the synthesis of β-globin chains. In turn, 
a relative excess of α-globin chains leads to increased erythroid precursor apoptosis, ineffective 
erythropoiesis, extramedullary expansion, splenomegaly and microcytic anaemia (Li et al, Nature 
Medicine 2010 16, 177–182). The affected beta chain gene is located in chromosome 11 and is an 
erythroid-specific gene, activated in late stages of erythropoiesis. At the biosynthetic level, the 
syndromes are categorized by the affected globin chains and in particular on whether there is a partial 
(β+) or complete (β0) defect in chain production. The most severe form is thalassaemia major, which 
is characterised by a severe (Hb 3 to 4 g/dl) transfusion dependent microcytic anaemia with genotype 
β0/ β0 or β0 / β+ and corresponding haemoglobin constitution of HbA2 ≥5%, HbF up to 95% and no 
HbA. Beta thalassaemia intermedia gives a clinical manifestation of moderate microcytic anaemia, has 
a genotype of β+/ β+ and on typical values on haemoglobin analysis HbA2 ≥4%, HbF up to 50%. A 
moderate, mild microcytic anaemia is the characteristic feature of minor beta thalassaemia (also called 
trait) where the genotype is β/β0 or β/β+ haemoglobin analysis and HbF is up to 5%.  
The COMP has previously considered that individuals with beta thalassaemia trait are not to be 
included in the proposed orphan condition, because of their limited clinical relevance (Premawardhena 
A Br J Haematol. 2008;141(3):407).  
The product has received a therapeutic indication for the treatment of 
• 
• 
adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response to or 
are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy 
adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with Beta-thalassaemia 
With regards to beta thalassaemia, it is acknowledged that treatment of “adult patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with Beta-thalassaemia" falls entirely within the orphan 
condition, “treatment of β-thalassaemia intermedia and major”, which would therefore be acceptable 
for this procedure. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been established based on the positive benefit/risk assessment of the 
CHMP, please see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has previously considered that the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating 
due to the severe anaemia, the need for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these. 
This view is still retained.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 6/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beta thalassaemia major causes a hypochromic, microcytic anaemia developing in in the first year of 
life. Without transfusions, ~85% of patients die by five years of age. Bone marrow expansion due to 
severe ineffective erythropoiesis results in characteristic deformities of the skull and face, and painful 
periarticular syndrome with microfractures and osteomalacia. Progressive hepatic, cardiac and 
endocrine disturbances develop, due to the accumulation of iron from transfusion and its deposition in 
the tissues.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a literature review and provided a range from 0.06 to 1.1 in 10,000 according 
to the type of publications used for EU27 and the UK. A table with the used sources is presented 
below, adopted from the sponsor’s documents.

The conclusion is in line with previous procedures of approximately 1 per 10,000, and was considered 
acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The COMP discussed the authorised products that would form the basis for the justification of 
significant benefit. In particular, it was considered that iron chelators as well as Zynteglo are 
authorised in the EU for the treatment of beta thalassaemia. Iron chelators (ICT) such as deferasirox, 
are indicated for certain populations (refer to SmPC for full indication) for the “treatment of chronic 
iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions... in patients with beta thalassaemia major...” as well 
as “chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy...in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes.” 
Zynteglo has also recently received marketing authorisation and is indicated for the “Treatment of 
patients 12 years and older with TD β-thalassaemia who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for whom 
HSCT is appropriate but a HLA-matched related HSC donor is not available”. 
Significant benefit 
The COMP considered that significant benefit would have to be justified versus the authorised products, 
which include iron chelators and Zynteglo. 
It was firstly noted that the main study encompasses standard of care, including chelators and 
transfusions. Indeed, it was reported that in the pivotal trial 97.3% of subjects received at least 1 prior 
iICT (97.3% of subjects in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group and 97.2% of subjects in the 
placebo + BSC treatment group). The most frequently used prior ICT was deferasirox (60.8% of 
subjects), followed by deferiprone (39.8%), and deferoxamine mesilate/deferoxamine (36.7%). All 
subjects, except 1 in the luspatercept + BSC treatment group, used at least 1 concomitant ICT during 
the study. The most frequently used concomitant ICT was deferasirox (65.1% of subjects), followed by 
deferiprone (41.0%), and deferoxamine mesilate/deferoxamine (33.7%). 
Given that the effects of the product in the pivotal trial have been studied on top of best supportive 
care versus best supportive care alone, the COMP considered that significant benefit against iron 
chelators has been justified.

With regards to Zynteglo, the sponsor produced both improved efficacy arguments, on the grounds of 
a broader patient population of the proposed indication, as well as a safety argument, on the grounds 
that Zynteglo requires mobilisation/myeloablative conditioning therapies. 
With regards to the argument of improved efficacy, the sponsor noted that the pivotal study ACE-536-
B-THAL-001 included both patients with the β0/β0 genotype, and without the β0/β0 genotype, also 
referred to as non-β0/β0. Out of 336 patients in the study, a total of 103 (30.7%) of subjects were 
β0/β0, and 232 (69.0%) were non-β0/β0. 
In the β0/β0 population, there was a non-statistically-significant trend in the primary endpoint (≥ 33% 
Reduction from Week 13 to Week 24 compared to baseline (see figure below). 
Figure 1.  Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001:  Forest Plot of RBC Transfusion Burden Reduction (≥ 33% 
Reduction) From Baseline from Week 13 to Week 24 (ITT Population). 
Importantly, rolling analyses have also been used to measure the responses within any consecutive 
12-week or 24-week interval throughout the entire study period. With regards to those analyses 
statistically significant differences have been reported, as per the table below. A clinically relevant 
advantage on the basis of effects in the βo/βo population may therefore be considered acceptable. This 
is also in line with the broadly articulated therapeutic indication as accepted by the CHMP, which 
encompasses the βo/βo population.

Moreover, the sponsor argues effects in patients eligible for HSCT- in order to juxtapose to the 
authorised indication of Zynteglo. Towards this end, they performed a post-hoc analysis on patients 
with severe iron overload, based on iron overload parameters (LIC >15 mg/g dw and myocardial T2*< 
10ms at baseline, as reflected on the SmPC of Zynteglo), and reporting statistically significant effects 
in transfusion burden compared to control. Indicatively, with regards to RBC transfusion burden 
reduction (≥ 33% reduction from baseline) during any 12-week interval throughout the entire study, 
the difference was 70.8% for the treated patients, versus 26.9% for controls (OR 6.49, p0.0002). This 
argument would also support effects outside the therapeutic indication of Zynteglo. 
In addition to the argument of improved efficacy, there was also a claim for improved safety over 
Zynteglo, based on the need for progenitor mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning therapies. The 
COMP considered that such safety arguments are difficult to support at this point in time, given the 
lack of a full juxtaposition of the safety profiles of the compared products.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In their deliberation, the COMP considered that the reduction of transfusion burden in the βo/βo 
population, as well as on top of iron chelation therapy, would constitute a clinically relevant advantage 
of improved efficacy versus the authorised products.  
2.4.  COMP position adopted on 20 May 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1 in 
10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the severe anaemia, the need 
for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Reblozyl may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data that support a 
reduction in transfusion burden, in a population that is broader than the one covered by the 
currently authorised products. The COMP considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Reblozyl, recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked 
to the human IgG1 Fc domain, luspatercept, for treatment of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major 
(EU/3/14/1300) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2014 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB 
linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data 
showing dose-dependent increase in haemoglobin in treated patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and progression to acute myelogenous leukaemia; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the 
medicinal product containing recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain may be of 
significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The Committee considered that the product 
acts through a novel mechanism of action, which may allow for the treatment of anaemia as a 
prominent symptom of the proposed condition as supported by preliminary clinical data in patients 
affected by the condition. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.

3.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell diseases 
characterised by cytopenias, dysplasia in myeloid cell lines, ineffective haematopoiesis and increased 
risk of development of acute myeloid leukaemia. 
They affect principally older adults with a median age of 70 years, and most patients are anaemic and 
transfusion dependent. Benzene and other chemical exposure, cigarette smoking and family history of 
haematopoietic malignancies have been linked to the aetiology of MDS. 
Prognosis is largely based on the marrow blast percentage, number and extent of cytopenias and 
cytogenetic abnormalities, which are grouped in a recently Revised International Prognostic Scoring 
system (IPSS/IPSS-R)(Fennaux et al 2014, Ann Oncol 25 s3: iii57-iii69).  
The product has received a therapeutic indication for the treatment of  
• 
• 
adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response to or 
are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy  
adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with Beta-thalassaemia  
The indication for the treatment of “adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very 
low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an 
unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy” falls entirely within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been established based on the positive benefit/risk assessment of the 
CHMP, please see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has accepted that MDS is associated with both morbidity and mortality as a result of 
anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, as well as transformation into AML. The seriousness of 
the proposed condition is acknowledged. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposes an estimate of up to 2 in 10,000, unchanged from the orphan designation. 
After providing the results of a literature and database search, the sponsor calculates the prevalence 
from crude incidence, by assuming a more or less stable incidence over the duration of the disease. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 14/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Firstly, reference to databases was made. The crude incidence for MDS based on HAEMACARE data 
was cited as 0.18 per 10,000 persons (Sant, 2010). With reference to Rarecare, incidence was 
0.15 and overall prevalence was 0.5 per 10,000 persons (Visser, 2012). Data from the Dusseldorf 
MDS Registry reported the crude point prevalence of MDS to be 1.14 per 10,000 (Neukirchen, 
2011). With reference to HMRN (UK based network) the annual crude incidence rate was 0.3 per 
10,000 persons between 2010 and 2016 and partial prevalence at 3,5, and 10 years was 
respectively 0.6, 0.82, and 1.05 per 10,000 persons (HMRN, 2019). It can be commented herein 
that MDS is a disease of the elderly, usually after the 6th decade of life, and therefore the 10-year 
partial prevalence would be a proxy for the estimate of complete prevalence. It can be additionally 
commented here that NORDCAN also gives a compete prevalence of approximately 1 per 10,000. 
•  Secondly, a list of publications providing country specific data was conducted. Incidence is derived 
from literature searches, which give a range of 0.23 to 1.26 per 10,000. The highest incidence of 
1.26 per 10,000 estimate comes from a very old study by Williams (Br J Haematol 1994;87:743-
5), that may be considered outdated. The search also gives a highest reported prevalence of 2.4 
per 10,000 citing a Greek study by Avgerinou et al (Ann Hematol 2013;92:877-87) 
• 
Thirdly, an indirect estimation of prevalence is performed, by way of the methodology outlined 
below, using the literature studied and assuming a duration of up to 5.3 years. The table examines 
four scenarios and proposes the 1.22-2.02 as more credible as it is also in line with the literature 
search. 
Table 3.   
An overall conclusion of approximately 2 was considered acceptable, in line with the previous 
considerations of the committee, and the above three analyses.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Several products are authorised for the treatment of the condition: 
•  Azacitidine is authorised for the treatment of non-eligible for HSCT patients with intermediate-2 
and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine covers among others secondary AML. 
• 
• 
Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to 
low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate.  
Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative 
diseases (MDS / MPD) associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-
arrangements. The sponsor notes that as per the WHO classification of 2016, MDS/MPN, also 
referred to as MDS/MPD, is a separate condition to MDS and has therefore been excluded for the 
purpose of SB exercise. 
•  Eprex is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia (haemoglobin concentration of ≤10 
g/dL) in adults with low- or intermediate-1-risk primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who 
have low serum erythropoietin (<200 mU/mL). 
The relevant ESMO guideline was published in 2014 (Fennaux et al Ann Oncol (2014) 25 (suppl 3): 
iii57-iii69.). As per this publication, it is customary to separate MDS into ‘higher risk’ MDS 
(corresponding to IPSS high or intermediate-2) and ‘lower risk’ (corresponding to IPSS low or 
intermediate-1). In high risk patients, hypomethylating agents (azacitidine) and AML-like intensive 
chemotherapy are used for patients not eligible for allogeneic SCT. For lower risk patients, the main 
priority is generally the treatment of cytopaenias, mainly of anaemia (usually the predominant 
cytopaenia), and the improvement in quality of life. Anaemia, because of failure of specific treatments, 
often eventually requires repeated RBC transfusions, leading to potential iron overload. 
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit is argued versus both medicinal products, as well as non-medicinal interventions of 
red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (where a major contribution to patient care is put forward) and HSCT. 
The COMP considered that significant benefit would have to be argued versus the authorised products 
azacitidine, lenalidomide, and epoetin alfa. 
•  Versus azacitidine, which is authorised for intermediate-2 and high-risk patients, the target 
population is argued by the sponsor to be different. This was accepted by the COMP. Indeed, the 
pivotal trial is performed in very low, low, or intermediate ring sideroblast positive (RS+) MDS 
patients who require RBC transfusions, thereby extending the population to lower risk MDS 
patients. 
• 
Lenalidomide is authorised only for patients with isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality, the 
latter representing a distinct subset of MDS with reference to the 2016 WHO classification for 
myeloid malignancies (Blood 2016, 127 (20): 2391–2405). In comparison, a key exclusion

criterion in the pivotal study of luspatercept was MDS associated with del 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality.  
•  With regards to epoetin alfa, it was also pointed out that the effects in ACE-536-MDS-001 were 
observed in a population where the use of epoetin alfa is not applicable. In particular, in the 
inclusion criteria patients would be refractory to (nonresponse or response that is no longer 
maintained), intolerant of, or ineligible for (serum EPO > 200 U/L) erythropoietin stimulating 
agents (ESA) (if previously received, must have discontinued ≥ 4 weeks prior to date of 
randomization). 
It was therefore considered that the accepted indication was covering additional populations compared 
to the authorised products. The pivotal study ACE-536-MDS-001 examined the efficacy and safety of 
luspatercept versus placebo in subjects with anaemia due to Revised International Prognostic Scoring 
system (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate ring sideroblast positive (RS+) MDS who require RBC 
transfusions. In addition, subjects were refractory to (nonresponse or response that is no longer 
maintained), intolerant of, or ineligible for ESA (defined as serum erythropoietin (EPO) > 200 U/L). A 
total of 229 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the luspatercept (N = 153) or placebo (N = 76) 
treatment groups. In this population, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who are RBC 
transfusion free over any consecutive 56 day (i.e., 8-week) period (Week 1 to Week 24) which was 
met in 37.9% of patients in the active group versus 13.2% in placebo (Odds Ratio 5.065, p<0.0001). 
Effects have therefore been described in a population different to the target indications of the other 
authorised products. Significant benefit was therefore considered justified on the basis of achievement 
of transfusion independence in a population that includes lower risk patients and those ineligible for 
treatment with ESA. 
3.4.  COMP position adopted on 20 May 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of myelodysplastic syndromes (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 2 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening as a result of anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, as well as transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Reblozyl may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has presented clinical data demonstrating 
achievement of transfusion independence in a population that includes lower risk patients and 
those ineligible for treatment with erythropoietins. This is broader than the populations already 
covered by the authorised products. The COMP considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.

The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Reblozyl, recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked 
to the human IgG1 Fc domain, luspatercept, for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes 
(EU/3/14/1331) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

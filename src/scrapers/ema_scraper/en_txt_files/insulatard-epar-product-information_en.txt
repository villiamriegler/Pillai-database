Insulatard dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. The 
physician determines whether one or several daily injections are necessary. Insulatard may be used 
alone or mixed with fast-acting insulin. In intensive insulin therapy the suspension may be used as 
basal insulin (evening and/or morning injection) with fast-acting insulin given at meals. Blood glucose 
monitoring is recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic control. 
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 international unit/kg/day. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
Insulatard can be used in elderly patients. 
In elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an 
individual basis. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the human 
insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
Insulatard can be used in children and adolescents. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
When transferring from other intermediate or long-acting insulin medicinal products, adjustment of 
the Insulatard dose and timing of administration may be necessary. 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
Insulatard is a human insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insulatard is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the abdominal wall, the gluteal 
region or the deltoid region. Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to 
reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Insulin 
suspensions are never to be administered intravenously. Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the 
risk of unintended intramuscular injection. 
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected. 
Subcutaneous injection into the thigh results in a slower and less variable absorption compared to the 
other injection sites. The duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, 
temperature and level of physical activity. 
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet.

needles up to a length of 8 mm. InnoLet delivers 1-50 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulatard InnoLet 
is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be 
used. 
Insulatard FlexPen  
Administration with FlexPen 
Insulatard FlexPen is a pre-filled pen designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable 
needles up to a length of 8 mm. FlexPen delivers 1-60 units in increments of 1 unit. Insulatard FlexPen 
is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be 
used. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this 
may mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop 
gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, 
vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. 
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is 
potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia  
Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case 
of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Insulatard must not be injected. After stabilisation 
of the patient’s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s 
insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. 
When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with 
their previous insulin. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in a need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Insulatard from another type of insulin 
may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with their 
usual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or during 
the first few weeks or months. 
Injection site reactions 
As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, 
inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given 
area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Insulatard. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Combination of Insulatard with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulatard is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between Insulatard and other insulin products. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism.  
The following substances may reduce the patient’s insulin requirement: 
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. 
The following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirement: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not 
pass the placental barrier. 
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes 
therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified blood glucose control and 
monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when 
contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase 
subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally 
return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no restriction on treatment with Insulatard during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the 
nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Insulatard dose may need to be adjusted. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies with human insulin have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of 
hypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see 
Description of selected adverse reactions below. 
At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions 
(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. 
These reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be 
associated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy 
with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of 
diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of 
diabetic retinopathy.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions 
The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, 
sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation and 
reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too 
high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty 
in concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
In clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and 
level of glycaemic control. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4) 
Paediatric population  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader 
experience in the general population. 
Other special populations  
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate 
any differences to the broader experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if too high a dose relative to the patient’s requirement is administered: 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary 
products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing 
products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, 
if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the 
patient in order to prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, 
intermediate-acting, insulin (human). ATC code: A10AC01. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver. 
Insulatard is a human insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Onset of action is within 1½ hours, reaches a maximum effect within 4–12 hours and the entire 
duration of action is approximately 24 hours. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an 
insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. 
This process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dose, injection route and site, thickness of 
subcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulin medicinal products are therefore 
affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
The maximum plasma concentration of the insulin is reached within 2–18 hours after subcutaneous 
administration.  
Distribution 
No profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been 
observed. 
Metabolism 
Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and 
possibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin 
molecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. The 
terminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of 
insulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ 
of about 5–10 hours. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.

1.  What Insulatard is and what it is used for 
Insulatard is human insulin with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insulatard is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. Treatment with Insulatard helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulatard will start to lower your blood sugar about 1½ hours after you inject it, and the effect will 
last for approximately 24 hours. Insulatard is often given in combination with fast-acting insulin 
preparations.

If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Insulatard 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.

increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulatard with alcohol 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Insulatard can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your 
diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.

feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulatard contains sodium 
Insulatard contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Insulatard is essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Insulatard 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulatard can be used in children and adolescents. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
Insulatard is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to take Insulatard 
Insulatard vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale. 
If you only use one type of insulin 
1. 
2. 
Roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy. Resuspension is 
easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. Draw into the syringe the same amount 
of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. Inject the air into the vial. 
Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull 
the needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct.

5. 
Just before use, roll the vial of Insulatard between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white 
and cloudy. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of Insulatard. Inject the air into the 
vial containing Insulatard and pull out the needle. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of fast-acting insulin. Inject the air into 
the vial containing fast-acting insulin. Then turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw up 
the prescribed dose of fast-acting insulin. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose 
is correct. 
Push the needle into the vial of Insulatard, turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw out 
the dose you have been prescribed. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose is 
correct. Inject the mixture immediately. 
Always mix Insulatard and fast-acting insulin in the same sequence. 
How to inject Insulatard 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. 
► 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that you have injected all 
the insulin. 
►  Discard the needle and syringe after each injection. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4.  
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people.  
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol, see Insulatard with alcohol in section 2. 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink, because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Insulatard or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is 
a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 
people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
List of other side effects 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncommon side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Very rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you 
may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Just before use, roll the vial of Insulatard between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white 
and cloudy. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of Insulatard. Inject the air into the 
vial containing Insulatard and pull out the needle. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of fast-acting insulin. Inject the air into 
the vial containing fast-acting insulin. Then turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw up 
the prescribed dose of fast-acting insulin. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose 
is correct. 
Push the needle into the vial of Insulatard, turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw out 
the dose you have been prescribed. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose is 
correct. Inject the mixture immediately. 
Always mix Insulatard and fast-acting insulin in the same sequence. 
How to inject Insulatard 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. 
► 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that you have injected all 
the insulin. 
►  Discard the needle and syringe after each injection. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people.  
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol, see Insulatard with alcohol in section 2. 
• 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink, because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Insulatard or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is 
a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 
people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.

List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Very rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you 
may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

How to use Insulatard 
Possible side effects 
How to store Insulatard 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insulatard is and what it is used for 
Insulatard is human insulin with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insulatard is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. Treatment with Insulatard helps to prevent complications from your diabetes.  
Insulatard will start to lower your blood sugar about 1½ hours after you inject it, and the effect will 
last for approximately 24 hours. Insulatard is often given in combination with fast-acting insulin 
preparations. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insulatard 
Do not use Insulatard 
►

► 
If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this medicine, see section 
6. 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see Summary of serious and very 
common side effects in section 4. 
In insulin infusion pumps. 
If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. 
If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. 
If any of these apply, do not use Insulatard. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. 
Before using Insulatard 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and Insulatard Penfill must not be shared. 
► 
Insulatard Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Insulatard 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation).  
• 
• 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulatard with alcohol 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Insulatard can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your 
diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Insulatard during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulatard contains sodium 
Insulatard contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Insulatard is essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Insulatard 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulatard can be used in children and adolescents. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
Insulatard is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Insulatard Penfill is only suitable for 
injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. 
►  Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. 
► 
Insulatard Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems 
and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. 
If you are treated with Insulatard Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use 
two insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. 
Resuspension of Insulatard 
Always check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even 
resuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
► 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Every time you use a new Insulatard Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin 
delivery system). 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b and back (see the picture) so that the 
glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times. 
Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection. 
The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy.  
Complete the other stages of injection without delay. 
How to inject Insulatard 
► 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
►  Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. 
►  After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Insulatard without the 
needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people.  
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol, see Insulatard with alcohol in section 2.

What Insulatard contains 
– 
– 
The active substance is human insulin. Insulatard is an isophane (NPH) human insulin

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insulatard is and what it is used for 
Insulatard is human insulin with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insulatard is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. Treatment with Insulatard helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulatard will start to lower your blood sugar about 1½ hours after you inject it, and the effect will 
last for approximately 24 hours. Insulatard is often given in combination with fast-acting insulin 
preparations. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insulatard

► 
Insulatard InnoLet is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need 
to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Insulatard 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes

• 
• 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulatard with alcohol 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. 
Insulatard can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during 
pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of 
hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Insulatard during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulatard contains sodium 
Insulatard contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Insulatard is essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Insulatard 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulatard can be used in children and adolescents. 
Use in special patient groups 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
Insulatard is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Insulatard InnoLet is only suitable for 
injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Insulatard InnoLet 
Insulatard InnoLet is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin as isophane (NPH). 
Read carefully the Instructions on how to use Insulatard InnoLet included in this package leaflet. You 
must use the pen as described in the Instructions on how to use Insulatard InnoLet. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people.  
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol, see Insulatard with alcohol in section 2. 
• 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink, because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Insulatard or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is 
a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 
people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Very rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you 
may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instructions on how to use Insulatard suspension for injection in InnoLet 
Read the instructions carefully before using your InnoLet. If you do not follow the instructions 
carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar 
level. 
Your InnoLet is a simple, compact pre-filled pen able to deliver 1 to 50 units in increments of 1 unit.  
InnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length of 
8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your InnoLet 
is lost or damaged.

Getting started 
Check the name and coloured label of your InnoLet to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. Take off the pen cap.  
Resuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. 
Resuspending the insulin 
Before every injection: 
• 
• 
• 
Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspension. If 
there are less than 12 units left, use a new InnoLet. 
Move the pen up and down between positions A and B and back so that the glass ball moves 
from one end of the cartridge to the other (picture 1A) at least 20 times. Repeat this movement 
at least 10 times before each injection. The movement must always be repeated until the liquid 
appears uniformly white and cloudy. 
Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. If you do not 
resuspend the insulin, this may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low 
blood sugar level. After resuspending, complete all of the following stages of injection 
without delay. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  1A 
Attaching the needle 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your InnoLet (picture 1B). 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and the inner needle cap. You may want to store the big 
outer needle cap in the compartment. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle. 
  1B 
Priming to expel air prior to each injection 
Small amounts of air may collect in the needle and cartridge during normal use. 
To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
• 
• 
Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise. 
Hold your InnoLet with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a 
few times (picture 1C) to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to 0. 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before injection (picture 1C). This 
makes sure the insulin flows. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 
6 times. 
• 
• 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the device is defective and must not be used. 
• 
If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose selector may move.  
This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Always prime InnoLet before you inject. If you do not prime InnoLet, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
  1C 
Setting the dose 
• 
• 
• 
Always check that the push-button is fully depressed and the dose selector is set to 0. 
Dial the number of units required by turning the dose selector clockwise (picture 2).  
You will hear a click for every single unit dialled. The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dial either way. Make sure not to turn the dial or correct the dose when the needle is inserted in 
the skin. This may lead to inaccurate dosing that can make your blood sugar level too high or 
too low. 
Always use the dose scale and the dose selector to see how many units you have selected before 
injecting the insulin. Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your 
blood sugar level may get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows 
approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
You cannot set a dose larger than the number of units remaining in the cartridge. 
  2 
Injecting the insulin 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor. 
Deliver the dose by pressing the push-button fully down (picture 3). You will hear clicks as 
the dose selector returns to 0. 
After the injection, the needle should remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure 
that the full dose has been delivered. 
Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed 
to return to 0 when you press the push-button. Always make sure that the dose selector returns 
to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been 
delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar level. 
Discard the needle after each injection. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 
Removing the needle 
• 
• 
Replace the big outer needle cap and unscrew the needle (picture 4). Dispose of it carefully. 
Put the pen cap back on your InnoLet to protect the insulin from light. 
  4 
Always use a new needle for each injection. 
Always remove and discard the needle after each injection and store your InnoLet without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle sticks and 
cross-infection. 
Dispose of your used InnoLet carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your InnoLet and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. 
Caring for your pen 
Your InnoLet is designed to work accurately and safely. It must be handled with care. If it is dropped, 
damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can 
lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can clean your InnoLet by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, wash or lubricate it. 
This may damage the mechanism and may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too 
low blood sugar level. 
Do not refill your InnoLet. Once empty, it must be disposed of.

1.  What Insulatard is and what it is used for 
Insulatard is human insulin with a gradual onset and long duration of action. 
Insulatard is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). 
Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. Treatment with Insulatard helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulatard will start to lower your blood sugar about 1½ hours after you inject it, and the effect will 
last for approximately 24 hours. Insulatard is often given in combination with fast-acting insulin 
preparations.

If any of these apply, do not use Insulatard. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. 
Before using Insulatard 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
►  Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
►  Needles and Insulatard FlexPen must not be shared.

► 
Insulatard FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need 
to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. 
► 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Insulatard 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation)

• 
• 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulatard with alcohol 
► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
► 
► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Insulatard can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your 
diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Insulatard during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
► 
• 
• 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulatard contains sodium 
Insulatard contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Insulatard is essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

How to use Insulatard 
Dose and when to take your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulatard can be used in children and adolescents. 
Use in special patient groups 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How and where to inject 
Insulatard is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Insulatard FlexPen is only suitable for 
injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Insulatard FlexPen 
Insulatard FlexPen is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin as isophane (NPH). 
Read carefully the Instructions on how to use Insulatard FlexPen included in this package leaflet. You 
must use the pen as described in the Instructions on how to use Insulatard FlexPen. 
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you take more insulin than you should 
If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4. 
If you forget to take your insulin 
If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. 
If you stop taking your insulin 
Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 10 
people.  
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol, see Insulatard with alcohol in section 2. 
•

Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
►  When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
► 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. 
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink, because you may choke. 
Serious allergic reaction to Insulatard or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is 
a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,000 
people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
List of other side effects 
Uncommon side effects  
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Very rare side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you 
may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. 
Effects from diabetes 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin. 
Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. 
Get an infection and/or a fever. 
Eat more than usual. 
Exercise less than usual. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Instructions on how to use Insulatard suspension for injection in FlexPen 
Read the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the 
instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low 
blood sugar level. 
Your FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in 
increments of 1 unit. FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles 
up to a length of 8 mm. As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in 
case your FlexPen is lost or damaged.

Caring for your pen 
Your FlexPen must be handled with care.  
If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of insulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate 
dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level.  
You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak it, wash 
or lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  
Do not refill your FlexPen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. 
Preparing your Insulatard FlexPen 
A 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of 
insulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong 
type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
Every time you use a new pen 
Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it.  
This makes it easier to resuspend. Pull off the pen cap (see A).  
  A 
B 
Before your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: 
Move the pen up and down twenty times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball moves 
from one end of the cartridge to the other. Repeat until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. 
For every following injection, move the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times 
until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy.  
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces the risk 
of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, complete all the 
following steps of injection without delay. 
  B 
Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If 
there are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. 
See the big picture on top of this instruction. 
Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white and cloudy. 
Attaching the needle 
C 
Remove the paper tab from a new disposable needle. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. 
  C 
D 
Pull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  
  D 
E 
Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. 
  E 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. 
Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. 
Checking the insulin flow 
F 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To 
avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. 
  F 
2 units 
selected 
G 
Hold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a 
few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. 
  G 
H 
Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no 
more than 6 times. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. 
  H 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that 
the insulin flows. If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose 
selector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
Selecting your dose 
I 
Check that the dose selector is set at 0. 
Turn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. 
The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-
button as insulin will come out. 
You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge.

  I 
5 units 
selected 
24 units 
selected 
Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before 
injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much 
insulin is left in your pen. 
Making the injection 
J 
Insert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. 
Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful 
only to push the push-button when injecting. 
Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin. 
  J 
K 
Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds. 
This will make sure you get the full dose. 
Withdraw the needle from the skin then release the pressure on the push-button. 
Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood sugar 
level. 
  K 
L 
Lead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, 
carefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  
Dispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  L 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle 
attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles 
and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles – to reduce the risk of needle sticks 
and cross-infection. 
Dispose of your used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children.

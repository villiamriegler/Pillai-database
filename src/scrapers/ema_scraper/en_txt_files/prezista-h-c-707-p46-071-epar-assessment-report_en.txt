1.  Introduction 
On 10 September 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for PREZISTA, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study No. TMC114-EPPICC (“The final annual report of a 5-year study of the long-
term safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents in the European 
Union.”) is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In this study an oral suspension of DRV was used. A line extension was granted for ART-experienced 
paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) in 2012. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Prezista contains the active substance darunavir (DRV, also known as TMC114), which is a potent 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (PI). It was approved by the EMA in July 
2009, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products and low dose ritonavir (rtv), for the 
treatment of HIV infection in antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced paediatric patients from 6 to < 
18 years, based on the results of trial TMC114-C212 (including 80 subjects). At the same time, two 
other trials were initiated in 2009 in HIV-infected paediatric patients. Study TMC114-TiDP29-C228 
(ARIEL) in treatment-experienced children aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing between 10 kg and 
< 20 kg was finalised in 2012. In this trial an oral suspension of DRV was used. A line extension was 
granted for ART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg). 
The current indication of Prezista is:  
PREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult and 
paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight. 
The RMP identified a lack of information on long-term safety in paediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years 
of age and the MAH committed in April 2009 to carry out post-marketing research to further 
characterise the safety profile of DRV/rtv use in paediatric patients in Europe, in the context of the 
filing of the indication in treatment experienced paediatric patients. 
The MAH contracted the PENTA Foundation/ European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort 
Collaboration (EPPICC) to conduct a pharmacovigilance study of the use and safety of DRV in children 
and adolescents in the European Union.

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
FUM 051 Pharmacovigilance study to define the long-term safety profile of 
darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents in Europe 
This 5-year pharmacovigilance study is a category 3 additional PhV study per RMP of Prezista to 
address long term safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 infected children (3-11 years old) and 
adolescents (12-<18 years old) weighing at least 15 kilograms. This study was requested in 2009 in 
the context of granting the indication in treatment experienced paediatric patients. The MAH has 
already submitted four annual reports during this 5-year period; no new safety information has been 
identified in the pervious four annual reports of this study.  
In the last year of the study covered by this report, three new cohorts have joined the study: a cohort 
from the Netherlands, from Latvia and from Portugal. In the current submission, the final, fifth report 
(dated September 2015) is assessed. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
This report describes findings of the fifth and final year of this study (children reported to EPPICC 
cohorts as of 12 March 2015) and includes children in the previous reports with  extended follow-up 
time, including those discontinuing DRV within the reporting period, as well as additional children 
starting a DRV-based regimen since the last data merger.  
This report includes patients from three new cohorts who have joined the EPPICC network this year; 
the ATHENA cohort in the Netherlands and a cohort from Latvia and the Lisbon cohort from Portugal, 
increasing the coverage of paediatric HIV patients in Europe. Lastly, as of November 2014, DRV q.d 
dose was approved for children aged 3-<11 years, one child included in this data merger who initiated 
DRV on this dose after this date. In the last (fifth) year of the study covered in the current report,  
there were 531 patients ever on darunavir in the participating cohorts. 
The primary objective of this pharmacovigilance study (FUM 051) was: 
The overall aim of this ongoing study was to collect long-term safety data on DRV/rtv use in paediatric 
patients with HIV infection in a “real world” setting in the following 16 countries: Belgium, Denmark, 
Germany, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Thailand and the UK/Ireland. Countries newly contributing data this year were Latvia and the 
Netherlands. 
The secondary objectives were: 
 
 
To describe the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected paediatric patients aged 3 to <18 years 
and treated with DRV/rtv in Europe 
To describe off-label use of DRV/rtv in paediatric patients <3 years of age (excluding in utero 
exposure) 
Overall 17 cohorts contributed to this EPPICC report, 16 are mother-child and/ or paediatric cohorts 
and one single centre cohort of paediatric patients in Romania with parenteral (nonrecreational 
injecting drug use) HIV transmission, all cohorts provided individual patient data for this study. HIV-
infected paediatric patients aged <18 years who were on or had ever received DRV were included. 
Data were analysed separately for six groups of patients based on the dose given when they first 
started DRV. Division of AIDS (DAIDS) gradings for paediatric adverse events were used to categorise 
the severity of laboratory results (absolute neutrophil counts, total cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine 
transaminase, total bilirubin, fasting plasma glucose, non-fasting plasma glucose, pancreatic amylase, 
and lipase) and clinical events.

Data collected included demographics, deaths and losses to follow-up, as well as follow-up data (both 
pre- and post-DRV) for patient weights, ART, AIDS events, CD4 and HIV-1 RNA, key haematology and 
biochemistry results, and adverse events. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: HIV-
infected paediatric patients aged <18 years; and who are currently receiving or have ever received 
DRV. Periods of time in MAH trials were excluded from the analysis in order to avoid duplicate 
analyses. 
Information on demographic characteristics, ART treatment, and adverse events occurring while on 
DRV were summarised separately for patients who initiated DRV in accordance to therecommended 
dose for weight, age and RTV co-administration (on-label) and those who did not (off-label), as listed 
below: 
  3-<18 years taking a licensed dose of DRV/r b.i.d. (or within a window of ±20% of the licensed 
dose) 
  12-<18 years, weight ≥40kg, taking the licensed dose of 800mg DRV/r q.d. 
  3-<12 years, weight ≥15kg taking a licensed dose of DRV/r q.d 
  3-<18 years taking an unlicensed dose or unboosted DRV 
  0-<3 years 
  3-<18 years, with missing weight or dose 
The number of patients and laboratory tests and severity of events are reported in four distinct time 
periods: (i) 12-months pre-DRV; (ii) < 12-months since start of DRV; (iii) 12-24 months of DRV; and 
(iv) >24 months of DRV. In this year’s report only children with ≥3 months follow up after start of DRV 
were included in the analysis of laboratory tests. A child can contribute to multiple time periods based 
on the duration of follow up and availability of laboratory data, although he/she can only be counted 
once within each grade category (with grades 3 and 4 counted together) within each time period. 
Rates of first events are reported in each time period after start of DRV per 100 patient years for 
patients aged 3 to <18 years (groups i, ii, and iv) with ≥3 months on DRV to allow for the opportunity 
of laboratory monitoring (group iii was not included as the single patient had <3 months of follow up 
after start of DRV and no laboratory data). Rates were reported where there were ≥20 patients in 
follow up within each group-treatment period. Rates are not calculated for children aged<3 years and 
small groups in other dosing categories due to small sample sizes, or for the 12-month period pre-DRV 
due to the complex ART treatment histories of many patients starting DRV. All lab tests conducted >30 
days after DRV discontinuation are excluded from all analyses with the aim of better assessing events 
while on DRV. 
Clinical adverse events are reported for all patients (irrespective of duration on DRV), if the event 
occurred within 1 month after discontinuation of DRV. 
Data review 
Results 
Data are presented for all paediatric patients who took DRV and were reported to an EPPICC cohort by 
12th March 2015. Cumulatively 17 cohorts from 16 countries provided data, including the Lisbon 
cohort, the Latvian cohort and the ATHENA cohort from the Netherlands which joined in this study for 
the first time this year. Overall, 534 patients had ever taken any dose of DRV as of 12th March 2015. 
Three patients out of 534 were excluded from the study as they had follow up only within MAH-
sponsored studies. See figure 1 below.

Flowchart of patients and first episodes on DRV 
Characteristics of patient taking DRV 
Out of 531 patients, 44% were black African, and almost all (95%) were infected with HIV through 
mother to child transmission. A total of 36% had been diagnosed with AIDS and 6 patients died during 
the follow up time. 
The median age at the start of any ART regimen was 2.0 years for the licensed b.i.d. dose group, and 
the median age at the start of a DRV-containing regimen was 14.5 years overall, very similar to the 
ages reported in last year’s report, despite an 23% increase in number of patients reported (from 431 
patients in 2014 to 531 patients in 2015). Around 16% of patients across all groups had discontinued 
DRV at last follow-up, a slight increase from the 11% reported last year. The median time on a DRV 
regimen was 28 months for those in the licensed b.i.d. dose group, and 19 months overall, comparable 
to the durations reported last year.

Table 1 Antiretroviral therapy profile of all paediatric patients taking DRV (n=531) 
CHMP’s comments: 
The number of children and adolescents participating in the study has increased from 123 patients in 
the first year (2011) of the study to 531 in the final year.  
Despite of this increase, the children who received darunavir for the first time when they were under 
the age of 12 are less represented in the study population. The largest proportion of children received 
darunavir for the first time when they were 12-<18 year old (422, 79%), while a smaller proportion of 
children received darunavir for the first time when they were < 12 years old (109/531,  21%) with the 
smallest proportion of children under age of 6 (11, 2%). 
The small number of children below 12 years old, and especially below 6 years could be explained by 
the fact that darunavir was indicated in older children for a longer period of time and the indication in 
children < 6 years old was granted only in 2014.

Laboratory data 
In general the numbers and rates of grade ≥3 adverse laboratory events were low.  
Licensed b.i.d. dose of DRV 
Laboratory toxicity data were available for 116 patients aged 3-<18 years on the licensed b.i.d. dose 
of DRV.  
There were 1086 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) test results for 107 patients. Three patients had one 
or more ANC grade 3 or 4 event (5 events), all occurred during the first 12 months of DRV. The 
incidence rate of a grade ≥3 ANC test in the first 12- months after start of DRV was 3 per 100 PY (95% 
CI 1-10), which is similar to the rate reported last year. 
There were 917 total cholesterol (CHOL) results for 110 patients. Fifty-five patients had at least one 
grade 2 event on DRV, giving an overall incidence rate for this grade of 23 per 100 PY (95% CI 17-30). 
The incidence of grade 2 hypercholesterolemia was 73 per 100 PY (95% CI 53-98) in the first 12 
months on DRV, and declined to 51 per 100 PY (95% CI 35-72) at 12-24 months and declined further 
to 22 per 100PY (95%CI, 14-32) >24 months after start of DRV. These rates are comparable to those 
reported last year. The number of grade 3 or 4 CHOL results on DRV remained reassuringly low, with 
11 events reported among seven patients; eight events occurred <12 months on DRV, one at 12-24 
months, and two after >24 months.  
916 triglyceride (TRIG) test results were reported for 112 patients. Four patients had at least one 
grade 3 or 4 test result (8 events) whilst taking DRV; four grade ≥3 results were reported during the 
first 12 months on DRV, three at 12-24 months and one after >24 months.  
There were 1,132 alanine transaminase (ALT) test results for 113 individual patients, none had grade 
≥3 results on DRV. 
Of 97 patients tested for total bilirubin (BIL) levels, three had at least one grade ≥3 result (17 events) 
on DRV: eight grade ≥3 results were reported during the first 12 months, five at 12- 24 months and 
four after >24 months on DRV. In last year’s report there were five patients with at least one grade ≥3 
BIL result on DRV, however events among two patients have been excluded as one patient had <3 
months on DRV, while the other was based on incorrect laboratory upper limits which has now been 
corrected and confirmed they were not grade ≥3 events. 
There were no grade ≥3 results for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), among 74 patients tested. 
One of the 27 patients tested for non-fasting plasma glucose (non-FPG), had a grade ≥3 result after 
>24 months on DRV. 
Three of 57 children tested for pancreatic amylase (P-AMY) levels had at least one grade 3 or 4 result 
(5 events), two occurring during the first 12 months on DRV, two at 12-24 months and one after >24 
months on DRV. There were no grade ≥3 events reported for lipase (LIP) out of 23 children with test 
results available. 
Licensed 800mg q.d. dose 
Laboratory results were available for 194 patients aged 12-<18 years on the licensed 800mg q.d. dose 
of DRV with laboratory data available, and with >3 months of follow-up. One or more grade ≥3 result 
was reported for each of the following: CHOL (two events among 998 tests in 184 children), ALT (one 
event among 987 tests in 160 children), BIL (four events among 1117 tests in 167 children), FPG (one 
event among 170 tests in 37 children), non-FPG (one event among 340 tests in 75 children) and P-

AMY (one event in 315 tests in 55 children), all except the ALT and FPG events occurred within 12 
months of starting DRV. There were no grade ≥3 results on the 800mg q.d. dose of DRV for 
triglycerides or lipase. 
Unlicensed dose 
Nine patients aged 3-<18 years on an unlicensed dose of DRV experienced grade 3 and 4 events. Five 
were previously reported last year. Seven patients had grade ≥3 ANC results, and six remained on 
DRV, three of whom subsequently had a “normal” result; the other patient remained on DRV for more 
than two years after the event before discontinuing due to treatment failure. Two patients had a grade 
3 BIL event, one had a subsequent “normal” result, while the other did not, both remained on DRV. 
One patient had a grade 3 CHOL event (as well as a grade 3 ANC result), remained on DRV despite not 
having a “normal” subsequent test result.  
There were no grade ≥3 observations in children aged 0-<3. 
CHMP’s comments: 
The rates of grade ≥3 laboratory events in the fifth year of the study remained low and were 
comparable to those observed in the last year study period. The review of the adverse laboratory 
events did not indicate new safety issues in the study population. The adverse events (including 
adverse laboratory events) considered by the treating physician to be related to darunavir are 
discussed below in the section on adverse events related to darunavir.  
Adverse events related to darunavir 
Adverse events reported as related to DRV b.i.d. dose  
Clinical data were available for 83 patients on the licensed b.i.d. dose. DRV related adverse events 
were reported in four subjects (five events); all were described in last year’s report: two adverse 
events of hypercholesterolemia, both serious, two non-serious adverse event of raised triglycerides 
and one of rash categorised as serious which led to treatment discontinuation. All events were resolved 
except for the hypercholesterolemia, for which there is no further information available. See also table 
2 below. 
Table 2 Clinical adverse events for patients aged 3-<18 years on licensed b.i.d. dose which 
were considered to be causally related to DRV (n=83 with clinical data) 
Adverse events reported as related to DRV 800mg q.d dose 
Three patients experienced adverse events, all non-serious, were reported as definitively, probably or 
possibly causally related to DRV in the patients on the licensed 800mg q.d dose (n=167 with clinical 
data); all were reported last year, one patient had raised triglycerides, another had rash and the third

had other skin changes. Two patients remained on DRV, one patient discontinued the drug 8 months 
after the event with reason given as patient’s wish/decision. See also table 3. 
Table 3 Clinical adverse events for patients aged 12-<18 years on licensed 800mg q.d. dose 
which were considered to be causally related to DRV (n=167 with clinical data) 
Adverse events reported as related to DRV unlicensed dose 
Three patients experienced a combined total of six adverse events considered possibly causally related 
to DRV in patients taking an unlicensed dose (n=52, with clinical data), all were newly reported this 
year. One patient had a rash and two patients reported abdominal pain, epigastric pain and diarrhoea 
related events (one patient had a subsequent event of raised triglycerides). All events except the event 
of raised triglycerides were resolved and all patients remained on DRV. See also table 4. 
Table 4 Clinical adverse events for patients aged 3-<18 years on unlicensed dose which 
were considered to be causally related to DRV (n=52 with clinical data) 
Adverse events reported in the age group 0-<3 years 
There were no events considered to be causally related to DRV among the three patients aged 0-<3 
years with clinical data. 
Adverse events reported in patients with missing weight or dose data 
Among the 78 patients with missing weight/dose data, one patient experienced clinical events 
considered causally related to DRV (raised triglycerides and cholesterol, not considered serious). 
SAEs reported by the clinician as unlikely to be or not causally related to DRV  
Eight patients on the licensed b.i.d. dose had serious adverse events, of which five were reported last 
year: one case of infectious gastroenteritis, one case of measles, one case of acute otitis media and 
two deaths. The deaths were due to a HIV-related metastatic adenocarcinoma, and an AIDS-defining 
event. Additionally a new case of rash was reported this year, a new case of anaemia and a case of 
decreased visual acuity, all were categorised as serious, and the cases of rash and anaemia were 
reported as being resolved while the latter was not. 
Of 167 patients on the licensed 800mg q.d. dose with clinical data, there were two SAEs unrelated to 
DRV or where causal link with DRV was not reported or unknown; one patient died due to a non-AIDS 
defining cancer which was reported last year and one new case of indigestion, oesophageal reflux,

gastritis was reported though this event resolved and the patient remained on DRV. Among the 52 
patients on unlicensed dose with clinical data, there was one death from an AIDS defining event 
(cytomegalovirus colitis with systemic involvement) leading to shock/heart failure, previously reported 
last year (although the patient was wrongly categorised in the licensed group last year). No SAEs 
which were not considered to be causally related to DRV were reported for patients 0-<3 years. Clinical 
data was not available in the one patient aged 3-<12 years on a DRV q.d dose. 
Among patients with missing weight or dose, there were two deaths, both reported in last year (one 
patient has moved across dosage groups this year): one due to post liver transplant complications, the 
second was due to an invasive bacterial infection. The causal relationship with DRV was unknown in 
both cases, the patient was on DRV at time of death in the former, and had discontinued DRV two 
weeks prior to death in the latter due to the physician’s decision. One new SAE was reported in this 
group this year, a case of spastic diplegia and categorised as serious, the date of event was unknown 
with no date of resolution given, the patient remained on DRV at last visit. 
CHMP’s comments: 
In the period covered by this last report, no adverse events have been reported for licensed doses of 
darunavir. However, three patients who received unlicensed doses experienced non-serious adverse 
events including rash, gastrointestinal symptoms and raised triglycerides levels. All three patients 
remained on darunavir despite the adverse events. 
In the five-year period of this study, a total of 534 HIV-1 infected children and adolescents were 
exposed to darunavir in this study. Clinical data were available for 383 out of 534 children. In this five-
year period, 11 out of 383 participants for whom the clinical data were available,  reported one or 
more  adverse events that were considered to be causally related to darunavir.  The reported adverse 
events in these patients constituted known and listed events such as raised triglycerides, rash,  and 
abdominal pain. There was no difference in the pattern of observed adverse events between the 
patients on the licensed b.i.d. dose, licensed 800mg q.d dose or unlicensed doses.  
Discontinuations 
Eighty-four of the 531 patients (16%) were not on DRV at their last follow-up visit. 
This proportion is slightly higher than the 11% (48/431) reported to have discontinued in last year’s 
report. Of the 129 patients on the licensed b.i.d. dose, 33 (26%) discontinued  DRV at last visit, of 
whom 9 discontinued <6 months after start of DRV, 4 patients after 6-<12 months, 17 patients ≥12 
months and 3 at an unknown duration. The reasons given for stopping were: treatment failure (3); 
adverse events – death (1, HIV-related metastatic adenocarcinoma, DRV associated causality 
unknown), lipodystrophy (1), dyslipidaemia (2), toxicity (1) drug interaction (1); patient-related 
reasons – non-compliance (2), patient’s wish/decision (4); structured treatment interruption (1); 
physician’s decision (2), other causes (8) and unknown (7). 
Twenty-five (12%) of the 216 patients on the licensed 800mg q.d. dose stopped a DRV-containing 
regimen due to treatment failure (1), adverse events (4, including one death – due to a non-AIDS 
defining cancer, causality to DRV unknown), patient-related reasons (8), physician related reason (8) 
and other/unknown reasons (4). 
Five (7%) of the 75 patients on an unlicensed dose of DRV at start of treatment discontinued 
treatment due to: treatment failure (3), death (1, an AIDS defining event, not related to DRV), and for 
unknown reasons (1). There were no treatment discontinuations in the 0-<3 years group nor in the 
patient aged 3-<12 years on a DRV q.d dose. 
Of the 107 patients with missing weight/dose data, 21 (20%) patients reported to have stopped taking 
DRV. The reasons for discontinuations were: death (1 – death due to invasive bacterial infection,

causality unknown), toxicity (2), patient-related reasons (6), simplified treatment available (3) and 
other/unknown reasons (9). 
Table 5 Reasons for discontinuation of DRV 
CHMP’s comment:  
A slightly higher proportion of the patients have discontinued darunavir in the last year of the study as 
compared  to  the  previous  year  (13%  vs.  11%).  In  the  five-year  period  of  the  study,  a  total  of  84 
patients (16%) have discontinued darunavir. The most common reasons for discontinuation in these 84 
patients were the patient’s wish/decision, non-compliance and the availability of another simplified ART 
regimen.  The  other  reasons  for  discontinuation  represented  isolated  events  and  their  review  did  not 
reveal new important safety information.  
Context data 
The UK/Ireland cohort is the largest of the participating cohorts, with 883 patients aged <18 years in 
current follow-up. The Italian, Spanish, Russian and Thai cohorts have 444, 376, 279 and 265 patients 
aged <18 years in current follow-up respectively. Among those on current follow up, 1871 patients 
have a HCV serostatus reported, of whom 71 were seropositive, giving an overall prevalence of 3.4%. 
The largest number of HCV seropositive patients were reported by the Russian cohort (34, giving a 
seroprevalence of 12%) followed by the Thai and Spanish cohorts (n=12 and n=7 respectively). 
Overall 33% of patients aged <18 years and in current follow-up were taking a 3-drug NNRTI-based 
regimen, and 40% a boosted PI-based regimen. The proportion of each cohort not currently on ART 
varied from 0% to 22%.  
It is not possible to estimate the coverage of the EPPICC paediatric cohorts, in terms of the number of 
children included in these cohorts compared to the number infected as a whole in the countries 
represented. This is due to a wide variation in the quality of the surveillance systems used in these 
countries, making national estimates, and comparisons of estimates between countries, unreliable.

Only two contributing cohorts have nationwide data capture: the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study 
follows virtually all HIV-infected children receiving treatment in the UK and Ireland, and contributed 
45% of the total number of patients to this analysis; and the Italian Register has >100 collaborating 
clinics and contributed 11% of patients. 
However the context data provided indicate that the cohorts together had 3,115 patients in current 
follow-up aged <18 years. Within these cohorts, 531 patients aged <18 years had ever taken DRV, 
this is an increase of 100 patients from the 431 patients reported last year, although our network has 
expanded this year with the addition of two new countries (Netherlands and Latvia, contributing 14 
patients ever received DRV).  
While the use of DRV has increased steadily over the course of this 5-year study, it remains relatively 
infrequently used in paediatric patients in Europe, with around 17% (531/3115) of paediatric patients 
having ever taken it. However, at last follow-up, boosted PI+NRTI based regimens were the most 
common ART regimens taken, with approximately 40% of cohort patients on ART taking this type of 
regimen. Pharmacovigilance data suggest that 262 paediatric patients taking DRV since 1st January 
2011 were on DRV at last follow-up, and that these children constitute 21% (262/1225) of all patients 
on boosted PI+NRTI based regimens. 
CHMP’s comments: 
The context data suggest that DRV remains to be relatively infrequently prescribed to children 
compared to other ART agents – with around 17% of HIV-infected children (531 on DRV-containing 
ART out of 3115 on any ART) in the contributing cohorts had ever taken any dose of DRV. This could 
be explained by the fact that darunavir has been recently approved for treatment of younger children 
and therefore not much used in this group. Furthermore, other PI’s are preferred in children < 12 
years old according to the current PENTA guidelines.1 
MAH conclusion 
Laboratory abnormalities and adverse events were reported infrequently, and only ten patients had 
adverse events considered by the treating physician to be causally related to DRV. Since DRV must be 
taken with ritonavir and other antiretroviral drugs (and in some cases with concomitant medication), it 
is difficult to attribute causality for these occurrences to any one specific agent. DRV was prescribed 
relatively infrequently in the paediatric HIV-infected population.  
In summary, results from this five year pharmacovigilance study, which include cohorts across 16 
countries, suggest that in general, DRV-containing regimens, both licensed and unlicensed, appear to 
be well tolerated in the paediatric population of HIV-infected patients, and that discontinuations for 
adverse events were rarely reported.

long-term  safety  profile  of 
Overall Conclusion: 
Based on the review of the fifth, final Annual Report “Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of 
darunavir (DRV) in HIV infected children and adolescents in Europe” regarding FUM 051 
(EMEA/H/C/000707/FUM) for Prezista (darunavir), the CHMP concludes the following: 
 
The  number  of  children  and  adolescents  participating  in  the  study  has  increased  from  123 
patients  in  the  first  year  (2011)  of  the  study  to  531  in  the  fifth,  final  year.  Despite  of  this 
increase, the children who received darunavir for the first time when they were under the age 
of 12 are less represented in the study population. The largest proportion of children received 
darunavir  for  the  first  time  when  they  were  12-<18  year  old  (422,  79%),  while  a  smaller 
proportion  of  children  received  darunavir  for  the  first  time  when  they  were  <  12  years  old 
(109/531,  21%) with the smallest proportion of children under the age of 6 (11, 2%). 
The  small  number  of  children  below  12  years  old,  and  especially  below  6  years  could  be 
explained by the fact that darunavir was indicated in older children for a longer period of time 
and  the  indication  in  children  <  6  years  old  was  granted  only  in  2014.  In  addition,  in  the 
current  clinical  guidelines  for  treatment  of  HIV  infected  children  in  Europe  (i.e.,  PENTA 
guidelines  2015)  ,  use  of  darunavir-containing  ART  regimens  is  recommend  in  children  >  12 
years old, while other protease inhibitors are recommended in children below 12 years old. 
  Overall, in the course of this 5-year study, no new safety information with regard to long-term 
safety  in  children  and  adolescents  became  available.  In  the  five-year  period  of  this  study,  a 
total  of  531  HIV-1  infected  children  and  adolescents  were  exposed  to  darunavir.  In  this  five-
year period, 11 out of 383 participants for whom the clinical data were available,  reported one 
or  more    adverse  events  that  were  considered  to  be  causally  related  to  darunavir.    The 
reported  adverse  events  in  these  11  patients  constituted  known  and  listed  events  such  as 
raised  triglycerides,  rash,    and  abdominal  pain.  There  was  no  difference  in  the  pattern  of 
observed adverse events between the patients on the licensed b.i.d. dose, licensed 800mg q.d 
dose  or  unlicensed  doses.  However,  considering  the  low  number  of  children  who  received 
darunavir  first  time  when  they  were  under  the  age  of  6,  no  firm  conclusions  could  be  drawn 
regarding this age group.  
  Based on the results of the study, the long-term safety of darunavir in children aged from 6 to 
17 years old is no longer considered missing information (per EU-RMP of Prezista) and could be 
removed from the RMP. Long-term safety of darunavir in children from 3 to 6 years old is still 
considered  as  missing  information  and  is  subject  to  routine  monitoring  and  discussion  of  any 
new data in the future PSURs.  
 
In conclusion, the FUM 051,  Pharmacovigilance study to define the long-term safety profile of 
darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents in Europe, is considered fulfilled. 
The  safety  concern  (as  missing  information)  ”long-term  safety  in  children  3-17  years  old” 
should be adjusted to “long term safety in children 3-<6 years old”.  
  Fulfilled: 
 
long-term  safety  profile  of 
The  FUM  051,  Pharmacovigilance  study  to  define  the 
darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents in Europe, is considered fulfilled. 
The MAH should update the RMP to update the completion of the study and to adjust the safety 
concern  (as  missing  information  in  the  RMP)  ”long-term  safety  in  children  3-17  years  old”  to 
“long term safety in children 3-<6 years old”. This should be done at the time of the next RMP 
update for Prezista.

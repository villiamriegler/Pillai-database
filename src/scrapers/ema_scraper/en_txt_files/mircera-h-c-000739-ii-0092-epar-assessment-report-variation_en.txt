Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years 
of age requiring dialysis or not yet on dialysis and switching from another ESA to Mircera, based on 
final results from study NH19708; this is a single-arm, open-label, Phase II study of Mircera in patients 
aged 3 months to <18 years with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis to generate PK, efficacy, and 
safety data for subcutaneous (SC) administration of Mircera. In addition, supportive data from studies 
NH19707, Modeling & Simulation study (Study 3) and MH40258 were included. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI 
and to update the Instruction for Use in the Package Leaflet. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0317/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0317/2017 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0317/2017.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Kidney  disease  is  defined  as  an  abnormality  of  kidney  structure  or  function  with  implications  for  the 
health of an individual, which can occur abruptly, and either resolve or become chronic. Chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function with 
variable  clinical  presentation,  in  part  related  to  cause,  severity  and  the  rate  of  progression  (Kidney 
International Supplements, 2012). 
Several paediatric nephrology societies from European countries have provided data on the incidence of 
CKD in children, as summarized by Harambat et al, 2012. Based on this data, even though age categories 
and  the  definition  of  CKD  differed  among  countries,  the  incidence  in  Europe  was  broadly  consistent, 
around  11-12  per  million  age-related  populations  for  CKD  stages  3-5,  and  8  per  million  age-related 
population for CKD stages 4-5. Children in CKD represent a very small percentage of the total of CKD 
population (NAPRTCS 2014 Annual Report and USRDS 2016 Annual Report).

Anaemia is a common comorbidity in patients with CKD, including children. This condition is associated 
with  multiple  adverse  clinical  consequences  and  its  management  is  a  core  component  of  nephrology 
care. Increased morbidity and mortality, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased quality 
of life have been associated with anaemia of CKD, also in children. Although numerous complex factors 
interact in the development of this anaemia, erythropoietin deficiency and iron dysregulation (including 
iron deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis) are the primary causes. The symptoms associated with 
anaemia  include  fatigue,  decreased  exercise  tolerance,  cardiac  dysfunction  and  impaired  cognitive 
function. The mechanism of anaemia due to CKD in children is identical to that in adults. 
The principal aims of anaemia management are to alleviate signs and symptoms arising from anaemia, 
improve  quality  of  life,  and  to  reduce  the  need  for  blood  or  red  blood  cell  transfusions.  Exogenous 
replacement of erythropoietin is an established method for treatment of symptomatic anaemia in CKD. 
This therapy can be divided into two phases: the initial correction phase, during which haemoglobin (Hb) 
levels rise and reach plateau levels, and the subsequent maintenance phase during which plateau levels 
are maintained by regular erythropoietin administration. 
Currently available treatment options for the management of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD 
include  short-acting  human  recombinant  erythropoietins  and  longer-acting  erythropoiesis  stimulating 
agents (ESAs). In Europe, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta and darbepoetin alfa are approved for 
the  treatment  of  anaemia  due  to  CKD  in  paediatric  patients.  Epoetin  alfa  and  zeta  are  approved  for 
patients  aged  1  to  18  years  on  haemodialysis  (HD),  and  epoetin  beta  is  approved  for  treating 
symptomatic  anaemia  caused  by  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  yet  on  dialysis. 
Darbepoetin was approved by EMA for paediatric patients on and not yet on dialysis in 2015. Darbepoetin 
and epoetin beta are approved for IV as well as SC use in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and epoetin 
zeta are approved for paediatric patients on HD, and dosing recommendations are given for IV use only. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mircera  (methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-epoetin  beta)  is  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  currently 
approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients. It has an 
increased half-life compared to erythropoietin. Mircera was first approved in Europe on 20 July 2007 for 
the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients.  
In  Europe,  pursuant  to  Article  16(1)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as  amended  the  marketing 
authorization holder (MAH) submitted on 08 February 2008 an application for a paediatric investigation 
plan  (PIP)  for  Mircera  (EMEA-000172-PIPO-07)  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA),  which  was 
initially agreed on 23 February 2009. A subsequent modification to the PIP was approved in 2012 (EMEA-
000172-PIP-07-M01). In September 2016, the MAH submitted another PIP modification, EMEA 000172-
PIP-01-07-M02 for which a negative opinion was received. Therefore, in 2017, an additional modification 
of  this  agreed  PIP,  a  waiver  for  a  paediatric  subset  and  a  proposed  deferral  were  submitted.  The 
modification  proposed  was  the  replacement  of  a  Phase  III  study  with  a  single-arm  Phase  II  study 
(NH19707 and NH19708) of Mircera in patients aged 3 months to <18 years with CKD on dialysis or not 
yet on dialysis to generate PK, efficacy, and safety data for subcutaneous (SC) administration of Mircera. 
In  addition,  an  extrapolation  and  simulation  study  (“Study  3”)  was  added  with  the  aim  to  pool  study 
Assessment report

NH19708  data  with  the  PK/PD  model  developed  on  adult  Phase  II/III  data  and  later  updated  after 
including  NH19707  data.  The  EMA  approved  the  modification  of  the  agreed  PIP  for  Mircera  (EMEA-
000172-PIP01-07-M03)  in  accordance  with  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  on  31  October  2017.  The 
general  approach  was  also  considered  acceptable  by  the  FDA  following  the  submission  of  an  updated 
Paediatric Development Plan in February 2017. 
The purpose of this submission is to seek approval for the extension of indication to include treatment 
of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years 
of age on ESA maintenance treatment. 
The clinical summary documents supporting this submission comprises 2 clinical phase II studies and an 
analysis of extrapolation and pooling data from adults and paediatric patients for a PK/PD model-based 
evaluation. Supportive data from a non-interventional study has also been provided.  
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, study NH19707 and NH19708 were conducted in accordance with the protocol 
and with the following: 
-  Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of 
Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International 
Ethical Guidelines 
-  Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines 
-  Applicable laws and regulations 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted information for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of methoxy polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin  beta  in  accordance  with  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2  guidance,  to  propose  an 
extension of the indication to the paediatric population.  
No additional non-clinical information (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology) was submitted. 
2.2.2.  Toxicology  
No toxicology information has been submitted. 
In the 13-week repeat dose toxicity studies performed with Mircera, rats and dogs were administered 
higher amount of PEG (1.86-fold in rats and 6.2-fold in dogs) than that the children will be dosed, and 
no vacuolation in any of the examined organs and tissues were reported in these studies.

2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has presented an ERA based on the Guidance on “Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin 
beta, also named Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.). 
C.E.R.A. is a chemically modified protein and it is not known to be an endocrine disrupter, and it is also 
not suspected to be a carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substance. 
Phase I: Estimation of exposure  
•  Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. 
The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow) for C.E.R.A has been estimated to be < 3, taking into 
the high water solubility of >17.5 g/l. 
As the estimated log KOW value is below the cu-off of 4.5, a PBT assessment is not required. 
•  Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The  PEC  has  been  calculated,  according 
to 
the 
formula  established 
in 
the  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2: 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * FPEN) / (default WASTEWinhab * default DILUTION)  
The maximum daily dose for C.E.R.A. used as a worst-case for the environmental risk assessment, is 
0.8 mg/d. Then, 
= (0.8 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.000004 mg/L = 0.004 μg/L  
Therefore, the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not exceeded, and risk assessment could be stopped. 
The applicant, in accordance with the ERA draft guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1, EMA 2018), 
calculates a new PEC, using a refined FPEN. For the purpose of the FPEN derivation a prevalence 10 per 
100,000 people was used. Using the duration of one treatment period (tTREATMENT) of 1 day, assuming the 
number of treatments per year (nTREATMENT) as 26 (every two weeks) and applying the default number of 
days per year (Nd) of 365, the refined fraction of a population receiving C.E.R.A. during a given time 
(FPEN-REFINED) can be calculated as follows: 
FPEN-REFINED = (FPEN-DEFAULT × tTREATMENT × nTREATMENT) ÷ Nd 
    = (0.01 × 1 × 26) ÷ 365 = 0.00071 
The refined PECSURFACEWATER is calculated as follows: 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * FPEN-REFINED / default WASTEWinhab * default DILUTION 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 9/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         = 800 μg/d × 0.00071 ÷ (200 l/d × 10) = 0.0003 μg/l 
The applicant concludes that the PECSURFACEWATER is below the EMA (2006) guidance action limit of 0,01 
μg/l. Since the PECSURFACEWATER for C.E.R.A. is below 0.01 μg/l, and no other environmental concerns are 
noted, it is assumed that C.E.R.A. is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment following prescribed use 
in patients. A Tier A Phase 2 ERA is not required. 
However, a limited set of biodegradability and acute ecotoxicity tests were performed for the purpose of 
classification  and  labelling.  Specifically,  a  ready  biodegradability  test  as  well  as  acute  tests  for  algal 
growth  inhibition,  daphnid  immobilisation  and  fish  mortality  were  performed  according  to  OECD 
guidelines and in compliance with the OECD Principles on Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
Phase II-Tier A: Environmental fate and effects analysis  
• 
Physico-chemical properties and fate 
Biodegradation 
A  ready  biodegradability  test  according  to  OECD  301  F  in  compliance  with  GLP  showed  46% 
mineralisation by BOD/ThOD after 28 days. However, complete primary degradation was observed within 
4 days of incubation (figure 1). 
Figure  1.  OECD  301F,  test  performed  using  regular  RO0503821  injection  solution;  initial 
concentration  adjusted  to  100  mg  RO0503821/l;  RO0503821  analysed  by  HPLC;  NO2/NO3 
determined at end of test. 
The  applicant  concludes  that  C.E.R.A.  is  not  readily  biodegradable.  However,  complete  primary 
degradation with mineralisation presumably of the protein part of the molecule occurs.

•  Calculation of Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC)  
The  acute-based  surface  water  PNEC  is  estimated  as  the  lowest  of  the  three  acute  surface  water 
ecotoxicity  EC50/LC50  values  divided  by  an  assessment  factor  of  1000.  In  the  case  of  C.E.R.A.,  with 
EC50/LC50  values  of  >200  mg/l  for  algae,  daphnids  and  fish  the  following  surface  water  PNEC 
(PNECSURFACEWATER) was derived: 
PNECSURFACEWATER = 200 mg/l ÷ 1000 = 0.2 mg/l = 200 μg/l. 
•  Calculation of the groundwater PNEC (PNECGROUNDWATER)  
The groundwater PNEC (PNECGROUNDWATER) is approximated as the acute EC50 for daphnids of >200 mg/l 
divided by an assessment factor of 1000:

Page 11/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PNECGROUNDWATER = 200 mg/l ÷ 1000 = 0.2 mg/l = 200 μg/l 
•  Calculation of the groundwater PEC (PECGROUNDWATER)  
According  to  the  guideline,  the  PECGROUNDWATER  can  be  assumed  to  be  typically  0.25  times  the 
PECSURFACEWATER. For C.E.R.A., PECGROUNDWATER of 0.0003 µg/L* 0,25 = 0.000075 µg/L 
•  Calculation of the sewage treatment PEC (PECSTP)  
The PECSTP is approximated as the surface water PEC multiplied by 10 (the default surface water dilution 
factor used in the PECSURFACEWATER calculation): 
PECSTP = 0.0003 μg/l × 10 = 0.003 μg/l 
•  Calculation of the sewage treatment PNEC (PNECSTP)  
An activated sludge respiration inhibition test according to OECD 209 over 3 hours was not performed. 
However, the toxicity control in the OECD 301 F ready biodegradability test resulted in a NOEC over 14 
days of 100 mg/l nominal concentration (NC)  
Based  on  this  substitute  data  the  bacterial  PNEC  for  sewage  treatment  is  calculated  as  the  inhibition 
control NOEC divided by an assessment factor of 10 according to REACH: 
PNECSTP = 100 mg/l ÷ 10 = 10 mg/l = 10000 μg/l 
Outcome of Tier A fate and effects analysis  
The surface water PEC/PNEC risk characterisation ratio based on acute toxicity data with algae, daphnids 
and fish is: 
0.0003 μg/l ÷ 200 μg/l = 0.000001 
The groundwater PEC÷PNEC risk characterisation ratio based on acute daphnid data is: 
0.00007 μg/l ÷ 200 μg/l = 0.0000004 
The sewage treatment PEC÷PNEC risk characterisation ratio is: 
0.0003 μg/l ÷ 10000 μg/l = 0.0000003 
It is concluded by the applicant that, since the risk characterisation ratios are 0.000001, 0.0000004 and 
0.0000003,  C.E.R.A  is  not  expected  to  cause  a  risk  to  surface  waters,  groundwaters  and  sewage 
treatment, respectively.

2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical toxicology information has been submitted. PEG has shown to lead to accumulation and 
vacuolation  within  specific  cells  of  the  CNS  (choroid  plexus  epithelia),  liver  and  kidney  in  nonclinical 
species  treated  with  other  PEGylated  medicinal  product.  In  the  13-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies 
performed with Mircera, rats and dogs were administered higher amount of PEG (1.86-fold in rats and 
6.2-fold in dogs) than that the children will be dosed, and no vacuolation in any of the examined organs 
and tissues were reported in these studies. The relevance of these data is limited by the lack of exposure 
data  to  PEG  in  animals  and  humans  following  Mircera  treatment.  However,  the  amount  of  PEG 
administered to humans as part of Mircera (0.000186 µmol/kg/month) is significantly lower (~2000 fold) 
than  the  exposure  threshold  value  of  0.4  µmol/kg/month  proposed  in  the  Safety  Working  Party’s 
response  to  the  PDCO  regarding  the  use  of  PEGylated  drug  products  in  the  paediatric  population  and 
thus,  it  seems  unlikely  that  PEG  levels  in  humans  can  reach  this  threshold  value.  In  addition,  in vivo 
distribution data indicated that Mircera can reach brain, but at low levels, and it should be considered 
that PEG-induced cell vacuolation observed in toxicity studies performed with other PEGylated medicinal 
products were not associated to functional consequences. 
Clinical experience with Mircera in adults and paediatric patients also did not raise any safety concerns 
pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation. 
In conclusion, all data together support that Mircera is not expected to cause any safety concern as a 
consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation to the CNS and other tissues. 
No new studies have been carried out to assess the environmental risk.  
An estimation of exposure of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in the environment, taking into 
account the prevalence of the disease, has been provided. In this way, the applicant has calculated a 
PEC  using  a  refined  Fpen,  which,  as  mentioned,  follows  the  postulates  of  the  ERA  draft  guidance 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Rev.  1,  EMA  2018).  Although  the  use  of  this  refined  Fpen  is  considered 
acceptable, the CHMP pointed that the approaches discussed in this ERA draft guidance are currently in 
draft format and their guidance are not in force at this present time. Although the principles of the draft 
guideline,  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Rev.  1,  EMA  2018,  can  be  acknowledged  by  the  CHMP,  current 
authoritative guidance is EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, EMA 2006. 
Since the PECSURFACEWATER value for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is less than 0.01 μg/L, and 
no other environmental concerns have been reported, it is assumed that the medicinal product is unlikely 
to pose a risk for the environment following prescribed use in patients.  
In addition, a biodegradability and three aquatic effect studies, that were performed for the purpose of 
classification and labelling, have been provided for this variation.  
The biodegradability methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was assessed by the MAH following the 
OECD guideline 301. methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is considered not readily biodegradable 
and, therefore, a Phase II Tier B does not have to be carried out. 
In toxicity studies, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta does not show toxicity to aquatic organisms 
(algae, daphnids and fish). 
No further assessment is needed to characterize the risk of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta to 
the environment.

2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  MAH  provided  a  weight  of  evidence  approach  regarding  the  risk  of  PEG-induced  cell  vacuolation 
following Mircera treatment to paediatric population. Available non-clinical and clinical data with Mircera 
did not raise any safety concerns pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation. 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. Considering the above data, 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Analytical methods 
Method validation 
REPORT  NO.  1046298:  Validation  of  an  Immunoassay  Method  for  the  Determination  of  Anti-EPO 
Antibodies in Human Serum YBS Study YCM/010 
A  bioanalytical  procedure  was  developed  to  determine  the  presence  of  anti-EPO  antibodies  (ADA)  in 
human serum (Screening Assay). A test was also established to confirm the specificity of the anti-EPO 
antibodies (Confirmatory Assay). 
The presence of anti-EPO antibodies is determined using a bridging ELISA format. Briefly, biotin labelled 
EPO is added to the streptavidin coated microtitre plate. After a wash step, aliquots of pre-mixed serum 
samples and digoxigenylated EPO are then added to the microtitre plate and incubated. After a wash 
step, anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated to HRP are added to the microtitre plate and incubated. 
After a final wash step, a colorimetric HRP substrate (TMB) is incubated, stop solution (0.25 M sulphuric 
acid) is added then the optical density at 450 nm (Ref 630 nm) is measured. 
Samples are initially analysed using the screening assay. Samples identified as positive are tested in the 
confirmatory assay in the presence of excess unlabelled drug. Finally, if required, the samples confirmed 
positive may be assayed at different dilutions to determine anti-EPO antibody titer. 
•  Cut point and Normalization Factor Determination: 
To determine cut point (CP), 40 individual blank matrix samples were assayed in duplicate on 
three separate occasions resulting in 120 mean assay values. The global mean optical density of 
NC for the six batches was equal to 0.0805. The normalization factor (NF) was determined as CP 
minus  the  global  mean  optical  density  of  NC,  and  this  NF  is  to  be  used  for  plate  specific  CP 
calculation in subsequent analytical runs. 
The summary of CP determination is presented below: 
CP = 0.09875 
Global mean NC = 0.0805 
NF = 0.01825 
Plate specific CP (floating CP) = mean assay NC + 0.01825 
CP of each subsequent plate is to be calculated as the mean of 8 replicates of NC run on that 
plate + 0.01825. 
• 
Low and High Positive Control: The antibody concentration corresponding to the assay response 
at LPC was back-calculated and was 14.6 ng/mL. The LPC was prepared in bulk by spiking the 
positive control antibody into NC serum at 14.6 ng/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots. 
The  concentration  of  the  HPC  was  selected  at  369  ng/mL.  The  HPC  was  prepared  in  bulk  by

spiking the positive control antibody into NC serum at 369 ng/mL and stored frozen as single 
use aliquots. 
The intra-assay precision of NC ranged from 2.2 to 27.3 %*. The intra-assay precision of LPC 
ranged from 1.1 to 7.0 %. The intra-assay precision of HPC ranged from 0.9 to 5.2 %. The inter-
assay  precision  of  NC  was  23.7  %*.  The  inter-assay  precision  of  LPC  was  13.8  %.  The  inter-
assay precision of HPC was 11.5 %.  
•  Assay sensitivity: Assay sensitivity, calculated as the average of the antibody concentration at 
CP obtained from the nine curves, was 8.87 ng/mL. 
•  Drug  tolerance:  The  highest  drug  concentration  still  providing  a  positive  result  (mean  assay 
response  above  CP)  was  considered  as  the  assay  drug  tolerance  for  the  specific  antibody 
concentration. 
•  Stabilities:  
o  The stability of the positive control antibody at room temperature in NC serum up to 4 
hours: LQC: %CV=4.8%. HQC: CV=1.5%.  
o  Freeze/thaw: Six cycles: LQC: %CV=1.8%. HQC: CV=3.0%. 
o  Freezer stability: The freezer stability of the positive control antibody in NC serum was 
investigated at -80 and -20ºC for 3 weeks. LQC: %CV=1.9%. HQC: CV=4.7% at -80 ºC. 
LQC: %CV=1.8%. HQC: CV=3.5% at -20 ºC.   
•  Determination  of  confirmatory  cut-point  (CCP):  A  sample  with  ratio  of  assay  response  in  the 
presence of 10 μg/mL EPO to assay response in the absence of added EPO less than 0.848 is 
confirmed positive for the presence of specific antibodies. 
REPORT NO. 1046299. Validation of an Immunoassay Method for the Determination of Anti-RO0503821 
(Anti-Mircera) Antibodies in Human Serum from Study YCM/009. 
A bioanalytical procedure was developed to determine the presence of anti-RO0503821 antibodies (ADA) 
in human serum (Screening Assay). A test was also established to confirm the specificity of the anti-
RO0503821 antibodies (Confirmatory Assay). The presence of anti-RO0503821 antibodies is determined 
using a bridging ELISA format similar to the one described above. 
•  Cut point and Normalization Factor Determination: 
To determine cut point (CP), 40 individual blank matrix samples were assayed in duplicate on 
three separate occasions resulting in 120 mean assay values. The global mean optical density of 
NC for the six batches was equal to 0.0215. The normalization factor (NF) was determined as CP 
minus  the  global  mean  optical  density  of  NC,  and  this  NF  is  to  be  used  for  plate  specific  CP 
calculation in subsequent analytical runs. 
The summary of CP determination is presented below: 
CP = 0.03861 
Global mean NC = 0.0215 
NF = 1.8 
Plate specific CP (floating CP) = mean assay x 1.8 
CP of each subsequent plate is to be calculated as the mean of 8 replicates of NC run on that 
plate multiplied by 1.8.

Low and High Positive Control: The antibody concentration corresponding to the assay response 
at LPC was back-calculated and was 0.208 µg/mL. The LPC was prepared in bulk by spiking the 
positive control antibody into NC serum at 0.208 µg/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots. 
The  concentration  of  the  HPC  was  selected  at  5.54  µg/mL.  The  HPC  was  prepared  in  bulk  by 
spiking the  positive control antibody into NC serum at 5.54µg/mL and stored frozen as single 
use aliquots. 
The intra-assay precision of NC ranged from 7.7 to 31.8 %*. The intra-assay precision of LPC 
ranged from 1.8 to 13.2 %. The intra-assay precision of HPC ranged from 1.1 to 6.7%. The inter-
assay precision of NC was 21.7 %*. The inter-assay precision of LPC was 20.3 %*. The inter-
assay precision of HPC was 21.0 %*. 
•  Assay sensitivity: Assay sensitivity, calculated as the average of the antibody concentration at 
CP obtained from the nine curves, was 0.0575 μg/mL. 
•  Drug  tolerance:  The  highest  drug  concentration  still  providing  a  positive  result  (mean  assay 
response  above  CP)  was  considered  as  the  assay  drug  tolerance  for  the  specific  antibody 
concentration.

•  Determination  of  confirmatory  cut-point  (CCP):  A  sample  with  ratio  of  assay  response  in  the 
presence of 10 μg/mL RO0503821 to assay response in the absence of added RO0503821 less 
than 0.519 is confirmed positive for the presence of specific antibodies. 
REPORT NO. 1054621. Validation of an ELISA Method for the Determination of RO0503821 (Mircera) in 
Human Serum from Study YCM/013 (including Add I). 
The objective of this study was to validate an analytical method for the determination of 
RO0503821 in human serum, over a concentration range of 150 to 4000 pg/mL, using a sample volume 
of 50 μL.

REPORT  NO.  1062976.  Validation  of  a  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  and  confirmation  of 
neutralizing antibodies against Mircera in human serum samples 
The anti- Mircera NAb assay is a quasi-quantitative cell assay based on stimulation of ASE2 cells. This 
direct  NAb  assay  is  based  on  growth  stimulation  of  AS-E2  cells  induced  by  Mircera  followed  by  the 
measurement of ATP using the CeiiTiter Glo® ATP luminescence assay. In the presence of neutralizing 
anti-  Mircera  antibodies,  growth  stimulation  is  diminished  or  stopped,  depending  on  the  antibody 
concentration.

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Study NH19707 
Study NH19707 was designed to determine the starting dose of IV Mircera in paediatric patients (aged 
5-17 years) with anaemia associated with CKD on HD when switching from stable maintenance treatment 
with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa  and  to  demonstrate  changes  in  Hb  over  time  in 
response to different doses of Mircera. The study also aimed to evaluate the PK of Mircera in paediatric 
patients. 
Population PK model 
Table 4. Summary of the studies included in the analysis 
A full model (ROCH1061b31) included effects of body weight and age on both CL and V. The effect of 
age on CL was removed during the backward deletion step, the resulting model (ROCH1061b34) was 
the final model. Its parameter estimates are recorded in Table 5. Parameters estimates were consistent 
to those found during the Phase 3 analysis, especially CL estimated at 0.74 L/day versus 0.75 L/day. V 
and  F  were  lower  3.5  L  and  0.33  respectively  compared  to  Phase  3  estimates  (4.7  L  and  0.39).  The 
estimates of body weight effects on CL and V were higher compared to previous estimates: 0.76 versus 
0.57  and  0.61  versus  0.44.  The  derived  ka  value was  0.41  /day,  lower  by  two-fold  than  the  Phase  3 
estimates.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  alternative  parameterization  used  here.  Diagnostic  plots 
presented in Figure 2 were good without major trend in residuals versus time or population predictions.

Model  qualification  was  performed  using  pcVPC  in  adult  patients  receiving  Mircera  iv,  adult  patients 
receiving  Mircera  sc  (Figure  3)  and  paediatric  patients  receiving  Mircera  iv  (Figure  4).  The  central 
tendency and the variability were well captured by the model. There was a slight tendency towards under 
prediction with the sc route of administration. In adults, the observed and the simulated data reflect the 
variety  of  dosing  intervals:  every  1,  2,  3  or  4  weeks.  This  assessment  of  the  model  predictive 
performance  qualified  its  use  to  perform  the  PK/PD  analysis  and  exploratory  simulations  e.g. 
investigating sc administration of Mircera.

flag (Ped Frel) was selected as it resulted in a larger drop in objective function value. Table 9 present

effect on the SC bioavailability. All parameters were very well estimated with parameters consistent with 
the previous analysis.

Immunogenicity  
Study NH19707 
In Study NH19707, blood samples to measure anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies were collected on 
Day 1 (before the first drug administration), at Week 13 and at final visit of the core period (Week 21), 
and at final visit (Week 73) of the safety extension period. 
No  patients  tested  positive  for  anti-Mircera  and  anti-EPO  antibodies  at  any  time  during  the  study, 
including  the  safety  extension  period.  For  this  reason,  the  present  summary  of  clinical  pharmacology 
studies does not include any information about correlation between immunogenicity and PK, PD, safety, 
or efficacy. 
Study NH19708 
In Study NH19708, blood samples to measure anti-EPO and anti-Mircera antibodies were collected on 
Day 1 (before the first drug administration), at Week 9 and at final visit of the Core period (Week 21), 
and at final visit (Week 45) of the safety extension period. 
A total of 131 samples were tested for anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Two samples tested positive 
for  anti-Mircera  antibodies  and  four  samples  tested  positive  for  anti-EPO  antibodies  in  2  patients.

However,  in  both  of  these  patients,  there  was  no  evidence  of  PRCA  or  other  safety  concerns.  Both 
patients continued to show good Hb response to Mircera treatment. Hb and Mircera doses were stable. 
The PK parameters in these 2 patients were not different from the rest of the patients in Study NH19708. 
2.3.3.   PK/PD modelling 
Study NH19707 
The PK/PD dataset included EBEs of PK parameters obtained with the final PK model. It consisted of the 
same patient population as the PK dataset and comprised 14366 data points: 12786 from adults and 
1580 from paediatrics. 
Parameters  estimates  of  the  final  PK/PD  model  are  recorded  in  Table  10.  Fixed  effects  were  fixed  to 
Phase 3 estimates. There was a full matrix of random effects with strong correlation particularly between 
Smax and SC50 i.e., 0.92, all covariance terms were well estimated. Interindividual variability in PK/PD 
parameters  was  found  consistent  with  Phase  3  estimates,  with  low  shrinkage.  The  estimate  of  the 
previous  ESA  dose  effect  on  SC50  i.e.,  0.389  was  consistent  with  the  Phase  3  estimate  i.e.,  0.303. 
Diagnostic plots in paediatric and adult patients presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 showed minor trends 
in population predictions.

Model qualification in paediatric patients was performed using VPC stratified by dose group. Results are 
presented in Figure 9. In both panels, model-based simulations well captured the variability in the data; 
the  observed  mean  Hb  time  course  (and  its  confidence  interval)  was  also  fairly  well  captured  by  the 
prediction  interval  of  the  simulated  mean  in  both  treatment  groups.  During  the  first  8  weeks  the 
prediction interval was on some occasions slightly  above the confidence interval, however the overall 
shape  of  the  observed  mean  and  especially  the  fluctuations  during  the  evaluation  period  were  well 
captured by the model in both groups. Further model qualification was performed using PPC stratified by 
dose group. Table 11 demonstrates the qualification of the simulation framework on three endpoints: 
mean change from baseline in Hb, occurrence of Hb>12g/dL during the evaluation period and doses at 
the end of the evaluation period. All prediction intervals included the corresponding observed value in 
NH19707  for  each  treatment  group  and  each  endpoint  of  interest.  This  assessment  of  the  model 
predictive  performance  qualified  its  use  to  perform  exploratory  simulations  e.g.  investigating  sc 
administration of Mircera.

The estimate of the previous ESA dose effect on SC50, i.e. 0.295, was slightly lower than the previous 
estimate  of  0.389.  Hb0  was  7%  and  14%  lower  in  peritoneal  dialysis  and  hemodialysis  paediatric

Study  MH40258  was  a  non-interventional  study  secondary  data  use  (NIS  SDU)  and  voluntary  post-
authorization  safety  study  (PASS)  that  collected  data  elements  of  patients  who  received  Mircera.  The 
data  were  extracted  from  two  existing  registries  within  the  IPDN  (International  Paediatric  Peritoneal 
Network [IPPN] and International Paediatric Haemodialysis Network [IPHN]). The data was collected for 
a period from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2021 for IPPN and from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2021 for 
IPHN. Study MH40258 did not provide PK data for the model-based analyses but contributed real world 
data  from  the  IPDN  registry.  The  data  from  Study  MH40258  (i.e.,  Hb  levels  and  Mircera  dose  time 
courses) was used to perform visual comparison with the clinical trials data and PK/PD model predictions.

Data was extracted from all paediatric patients below 18 years of age on PD or HD included in the IPPN 
and IPHN registries with at least one observation while being treated with Mircera. 
As shown in Figure 13, the clinical trial data spanned the same ranges and were similar to those collected 
from the IPDN registry, which provided additional evidence that the clinical trial data could be reproduced 
in clinical practice.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The characterization of the clinical pharmacology properties of Mircera in paediatric patients after IV and 
SC  administration  has  been  conducted  in  the  current  analysis  based  on  the  experimental  evidence 
collected in studies NH19707, NH19708 and MH40258.  
The modelling strategy used by the MAH is endorsed, since it re-uses the structural PK and PK/PD model 
definition established in the adult population and the clinical evidence collected in paediatric patients is 
pooled together with the adult data to re-evaluate its predictive performance. In addition, the Applicant 
conducted a staggered approach, since first IV data was analysed and secondly, PK evidence after SC 
administration  was  incorporated.  A  similar  approach  was  applied  to  characterize  the  time  course  of 
haemoglobin over time after IV and SC in paediatric patients.  
The final population PK model developed with data from studies NH19707 and NH19708 and adult data 
may  overall  capture  the  observed  data.  However,  the  provided  pcVPC  for  adult  data  following  SC 
administration, shows that the model excessively underpredicts the median of the data, which indicates 
that  the  estimated  bioavailability  of  31%  may  be  biased  and  the  true  SC  bioavailability  for  adults  is 
higher than this estimate. Furthermore, the SmPC states that the SC bioavailability for adult CKD patients 
was 54% and 62% for non-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively, which is almost 2-fold higher than 
the estimate from the popPK model. An updated version of the population PK model has been developed, 
which includes a specific volume of distribution for adult patients treated with Mircera SC. However, the 
effect of the route of administration in pediatric patients was not significant, possibly due to the lack of 
sufficient experimental evidence. The updated version improves the model performance based on the 
VPC. However, no differences in the volume of distribution could be attributed to the type of dialysis. 
Despite the SmPC reports different SC bioavailability based on the type of dialysis, the population PK 
model did not identify such effect as significant. In addition, a relevant aspect required clarification since 
a 2.18-fold increase on SC bioavailability was estimated in paediatric patients compared to adult patients, 
considering that a higher exposure in paediatric subjects may be relevant in terms of safety concerns. 
Since  no  definitive  and  clear  exposure-safety  relationship  has  been  established,  dose  selection  in 
pediatric  patients  is  based  under  the  assumption  that  similar  exposure  should  be  achieved  between 
pediatric and adult patients. In this regard, the MAH has provided the observed concentrations data for 
pediatric  and  adult  patients,  showing  similar  trend  among  both  populations.  Therefore,  no  need  for  a 
model-based evaluation of the exposure is required.   
The  PK/PD  framework  previously  developed  in  the  adult  population  has  been  applied  to  characterize 
paediatric observations. Final PK/PD parameter estimates were consistent with the estimated values in 
adult  patients  and  therefore,  no  relevant  differences  in  terms  of  system-related  parameters  (LS  and 
Hb0)  were  observed.  The  use  of  fixed  drug-related  parameters  may  be  justified  based  on  the  large 
evidence from adult data and to reduce the likely confounding effect on the estimation of the covariate 
effects.  The  join  PK/PD  model  with  adult  and  paediatric  data  was  able  to  characterize  the  median 
tendency and the overall variability. The external evaluation of the PK/PD relationship using real world 
data  (MH40258)  demonstrated  the  adequacy  of  the  modelling  structure  to  satisfy  the  observed 
behaviour.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of Mircera in paediatric patients after IV and SC administration have 
been characterized. Some aspects have not been fully clarified, however, since no definitive and clear 
exposure-safety relationship has been established, and dose selection in pediatric patients is based under 
the assumption that similar exposure should be achieved between pediatric and adult patients, a model-
based evaluation of the exposure is no longer being required.   
The overall strategy and the results provided are overall acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  is  based  on  the  extrapolation  from  adult  data,  two  dose  finding  studies  (NH19707  and 
NH19708) and a popPK model. Results from paediatric registry study MH40258 are considered supportive 
for the claimed indication. 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
Study NH19707: a phase II, dose-finding study, open-label, multicenter, 
multiple dose study of Mircera administered once every 4 weeks 
intravenously (IV) for 20 weeks in paediatric patients with CKD receiving 
haemodialysis who switched from other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent 
(ESAs) (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). 
Methods 
After the first administration of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera), dose adjustments 
were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week during the core study 
period. The evaluation period for Hb levels was Week 17-21. Patients who completed the 20 weeks of 
treatment and who adequately maintained Hb levels were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety 
extension period with the same dosing frequency. 
In  this  study,  the  protocol  foresaw  different  groups  with  different  conversion  factors  related  to  their 
previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. The first group comprised patients who 
started  with  an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose  (Group  1  hereinafter).  If  this  intermediate 
conversion factor proved inadequate, a second group (Group 2) was enrolled for treatment with a higher 
or lower conversion factor dose. The first 16 patients were enrolled in Group 1. After 16 patients had 
completed at least 16 weeks of treatment, a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of Mircera 
was made.

Treatments 
Mircera was injected iv  by trained healthcare professional once  every four weeks during the study (4 
doses during the titration period and one dose during the evaluation period). 
The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera 
intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric 
patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance 
doses of an ESA prior to conversion to Mircera, and assuming a linear relationship across dose ranges, 
the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose, 
thus correcting for the higher weight-adjusted dose requirements in paediatric patients.

Dose adjustments could be performed during the entire study (core study period and safety extension 
period)  (Table  15).  The  dose  of  Mircera was  adjusted  to  maintain  the  individual  patient’s  Hb  within  a 
target range of ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and between 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL.

Sample size 
This  was  an  exploratory  study  without  a  powered  statistical  group  comparison.  Therefore,  no  formal 
sample size estimation was performed. However, to determine the optimum starting dose of iv Mircera, 
the following sample-size calculations were made as an indication. Providing the optimum dose maintains 
the Hb at the baseline level and the true change from baseline was equal to zero, the number of patients 
sufficient to provide 80% power that the 90% CI for Hb change from baseline was between -1 and +1 
g/dL is:  
• 16 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was <1.3 g/dL  
• 36 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was <2.0 g/dL  
As per Protocol, additional patients were enrolled to replace patients who did not complete at least 18 
weeks of treatment, to ensure a sufficient number of evaluable patients.  
At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥5 to <12 years. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  enrolled  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  four  weeks  in  sequential  dosing  groups;  no 
randomization was performed. An Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IV/WRS) system was used 
to track the enrolment and to monitor the disposition of patients into four strata with respect to type of 
previous ESA treatment and age category. Enrolment of 12- to 17-year-old patients was closed earlier 
to ensure that a sufficient number of younger patients were included in the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Due to the nature of the study, no formal testing was planned and all tests and p-values were descriptive. 
The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP: 
­  The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients enrolled in the study. 
­  All patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication and had a safety follow-up 
were included in the safety population. 
­  All patients in the safety population who completed at least 18 weeks of treatment (and returned 
for an assessment in week 19), signifying that they had at least 3 Hb assessments during the 
evaluation period, were included in the completers population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023

­  The Per-Protocol (PP) population includes all patients included in the safety population and who 
had  no  major  protocol  violations  (patients  with  less  than  3  Hb  values  during  the  evaluation 
period,  patients  who  missed  any  administration  of  study  medication  at  week  13  or  week  17, 
patients who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria for Hb or iron levels, patients who fulfilled any of 
the  exclusion  criteria:  hemoglobinopathies,  hemolysis,  overt  gastrointestinal  bleeding  or  RBC 
transfusion within 8 weeks before screening/during screening period) 
­  The Extension Patients Population is defined as all patients having signed the informed consent 
for the optional safety extension period. 
Efficacy Analysis 
The different Mircera conversion factor groups were summarized descriptively in an exploratory manner 
using summary statistics based on means, standard deviations and percentiles. Analyses were presented 
by dose group. The main subgroups of interest in this paediatric study were the age groups (based on 
age at study start, 5-11; 12-17 years) and previous ESA (epoetin alfa/beta; darbepoetin alfa), both of 
which were used for stratification. 
The primary endpoint (change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods), and 
one secondary endpoint (change in reticulocyte count) were calculated on a per-patient basis, using an 
area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  approach  to  calculate  an  individual’s  average  for  both  the  baseline  and 
evaluation periods and taking the difference. The baseline period was defined as all assessments between 
the  day  of  first  study  dose  and  the  previous  20  days.  The  Hb  value  on  the  day  of  the  first  dose  was 
included in the baseline calculation as this assessment was performed before the first dose was given. 
The average Hb value for each individual during the evaluation period was based on all values recorded 
on study days 111 to 138. For patients with no recorded Hb during the evaluation period, the primary 
endpoint was missing. No imputation was made for missing values. If an RBC transfusion occurred, Hb 
values  measured  in  the  following  3  weeks  were  excluded;  any  Hb  values  recorded  after  a  renal 
transplantation were censored.  
The average Hb for the baseline and evaluation periods were used to classify each patient for the Hb-
based secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline covariate adjusted 
estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated 
from  an  Analysis  of  Covariance  (ANCOVA)  model.  The  model  contains  the  patient’s  baseline  Hb  as 
covariate and dependent effects for dose group, age group and previous ESA group. The primary analysis 
of the study was based on the ITT population. 
PK and PD Analysis 
Mircera  PK parameters were derived from serum concentration  versus time  data obtained from blood 
sampling from seven time points following the third iv administration of Mircera at week 9. PK parameters 
were read directly from the serum concentration versus time profiles or were estimated from the serum 
concentrations  by  noncompartmental  methods  using  WinNonlin  software  (Phoenix  64,  Pharsight 
Corporation,  Mountain  View,  CA,  USA).  Actual  sampling  times  were  used  for  the  calculation  of  PK 
parameters, except for all pre-dose time points, which were set to zero.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 15. Patient disposition of study NH19707 
A total of 112 patients were screened; of these 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in 
Group 2, following a preliminary analysis of Group 1). Among the 48 screening failures, 44 patients did 
not meet inclusion criteria, 3 patients did not sign ICF and 1 patient had a high likelihood of withdrawal 
(kidney transplantation planned). 
Replacement of patients not completing at least 18 weeks of treatment lead to a total of 48 patients in 
Group 2, 12 more than the protocol specified minimum of 36. 12 patients in Group 1 and 35 in Group 2 
completed the evaluation period. Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 
1-year safety extension, and this optional safety extension was completed by 17 patients. 
During the core study period, 4 patients in Group 1 (25%) and 13 in the Group 2 (27%) withdrew from 
treatment. The most frequently reported reason for withdrawal was renal transplant (4 patients in Group 
1  and  9  patients  in  Group  2).  Of  the  two  ‘other’  reasons  one  was  due  to  liver  transplant,  the  other 
because the department moved to another hospital. One patient in Group 2 died during the core study 
period of intracranial hematoma, considered not related to study drug (Table 16).

Table 16. Summary of Withdrawals (Core Period): ITT Population 
During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent 
and a further two, at the same center, due to ‘repair of the dialysis station’). 
Baseline data 
Patient Demographics 
Overall,  there  were  34  male  patients  (53%),  with  a  higher  representation  in  Group  1  compared  with 
Group 2 (Table 17). 
The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ± SD age was 11 ± 3.2 years in Group 1 and 
13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly represented in Group 
1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%). The youngest patient was 6 years old (see age distribution in 
Figure 16). The mean baseline body surface area (according to the Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 
in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.  
Median Z scores for height and pre-dialysis weight were negative in both groups (height: -1.07 and - 
1.67,  respectively,  for  Group  1  and  Group  2;  weight  -0.87  and  -1.32,  respectively),  indicating,  as 
expected in this patient population, under-developed, underweight patients compared with children of 
the same sex and age.

Baseline Laboratory Parameters 
Median baseline haemoglobin levels were 11.2 g/dL in Group 1 and 11.1 g/dL in Group 2 (Table 18). 
Ferritin and calculated transferrin saturation levels were generally higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Of 
note, overall, 12 patients (19%) had C reactive protein levels above 5 mg/L.

Previous ESA Therapy  
The median time since first ESA administration was 22 months in Group 1 and 14 months in Group 2 
(Table  19).  In  Group  1,  the  last  ESA  administered  prior  to  screening  was  darbepoetin  in  8  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023

(median weekly dose, 17.5 µg) and epoetin alfa/beta in 8 patients (median weekly dose, 4500 IU). In 
Group 2, the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 26 patients (median weekly 
dose,  20  µg)  and  epoetin  alfa/beta  in  22  patients  (median  weekly  dose,  6000  IU).  For  the  patients 
receiving  darbepoetin,  most  patients  were  receiving  once-weekly  administrations.  For  those  patients 
receiving epoetin alfa/beta, most were dosed 2-3 times a week, which is in accordance with the posology 
authorized.

Previous and Concurrent Diseases  
Aetiology of Chronic Kidney Disease  
The  most  frequently  reported  aetiology  of  CKD  was  hereditary  nephropathy  (16  patients  overall), 
followed by hypoplastic/dysplastic kidneys (14 patients overall). 
Risk Factors for Vascular Events and Haemorrhage 
A  total  of  32  patients  (50%)  had  reported  experiencing  arterial  hypertension  at  any  time  before 
enrolment, 6 patients (9%) had experienced venous thrombosis and 5 (8%) had experienced at least 
one haemorrhage event. 
Previous and Concomitant Treatments  
Anticoagulation Treatment  
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 51/132 
 
 
 
 
 
All  patients  had  anticoagulation  treatment  prior  to  study  start,  with  the  most  frequently  used  agents 
being heparin sodium (3 [19%] in Group 1 and 25 [52%] in Group 2) and enoxaparin sodium (11 [69%] 
in Group 1 and 16 [33%] in Group 2).  
Iron Supplementation  
Most patients recorded receiving iron supplementation prior to study start (58 patients [91%]); during 
the  study,  including  the  safety  extension  period,  iron  supplementation  was  recorded  by  15  patients 
(94%) in Group 1 and 47 (98%) in Group 2. The most frequently used agents were iron sucrose, ferrous 
gluconate, and ferric hydroxide.  
Antihypertensive Agents  
Using a classification based on selected coded medication classes, at study start, 37 (58%) patients were 
taking  or  had  taken  ‘antihypertensive  and/or  diuretic  agents’,  the  most  common  categories  being 
angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  calcium  channel  blocking  agents  and  'beta-adrenoceptor 
blocking agents. There were 38 patients recorded as taking at least one of these agents during the study.  
Other Treatments 
Apart  from  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (all  patients  were  on  haemodialysis),  anticoagulants  and 
anti-anaemic agents, the most frequently used concomitant treatments were vitamins and minerals (15 
[94%] in Group 1 and 44 [92%] in Group 2), of which vitamin D supplements were the top 3 treatments; 
calcium compounds and regulators (9 [56%] in Group 1 and 37 [77%] in Group 2) and supplements (11 
[69%] in Group 1 and 30 [63%]in Group 2), of which the most frequently used were sodium bicarbonate 
and carnitine. 
Haemodialysis at Baseline  
The median duration of haemodialysis at baseline was 1.3 years in Group 1 and just under 1 year in 
Group 2. Approximately 75% of patients had been on haemodialysis for under 2.2 years, and had dialysis 
treatment (i.e., possible previous peritoneal dialysis) for less than 4 years. The majority of patients in 
both  groups  had  three  haemodialysis  sessions  per  week.  Mean  ±  SD  Kt/V,  a  measure  of  dialysis 
adequacy, was 1.57 ± 0.377 in Group 1 and 1.60 ± 0.408 in Group 2 (a higher score indicates better 
dialysis adequacy, with 1.20 considered adequate). Mean ± SD urea reduction ratio, another measure 
of dialysis adequacy, was 79% ± 8.5% in Group 1 and 72% ± 9.0% in Group 2 (a higher percentage 
indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 65% considered adequate). 
Recruitment/Numbers analysed 
All ITT patients (16 patients in Group 1 and 48 in Group 2, 64 patients overall) received at least one 
dose  of  the  treatment  and  were  included  in  the  safety  population.  Therefore,  the  ITT  and  safety 
population were the same.  
The (core study period) completers population (patients completing at least 18 weeks of treatment with 
at least three Hb assessments during the evaluation period) comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 36 in 
Group 2. One patient dropped out at week 19, therefore was included in completers population but did 
not complete the evaluation period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 52/132 
 
 
 
The PP population comprised the patients in the completers population with the exclusion of 2 additional 
patients in Group 2 who were protocol violators of the inclusion criterion regarding iron levels. The PP 
population thus comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 34 in Group 2. 
In total, 37 patients signed the informed consent to enter the safety extension (9 from Group 1 and 28 
from Group 2). In Group 1, one patient withdrew consent without receiving any study drug or performing 
any study procedures during the extension period. 
Table 20. Summary of Populations 
In the core study period, 21 protocol deviations were reported in 15 patients; all these violations were 
related  to  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (Table  21).  The  two  patients  with  inadequate  iron  status  at 
baseline were excluded from the PP population. 
Table 21. Overview of protocol deviations 
Conduct of Study 
Five protocol amendments were issued. Of note, in the original protocol, the standard deviation of the 
Hb change from baseline used for the sample size calculation was assumed to be 1.5 g/dL. However, 
following the preliminary assessment of Group 2, the variability (standard deviation) of the data ranged 
from  1.9  to  2.1  g/dL.  The  assumed  standard  deviation  was  therefore  increased  to  2.0  g/dL  and  the 
Assessment report

sample size revised in Protocol Amendment D. The sample size, for the optimum dose group only, for 
the group to enrol additional patients, was increased to 36 patients (an additional 20 patients instead of 
9 after the assessment of the initial 16 patients). It was also recommended at this time that patients 
that did not complete the core study period were to be replaced, as allowed per-protocol. 
The  protocol  stated  that  for  the  primary  analysis  the  last  observation  carried  forward  method  (LOCF) 
was to be used to impute missing Hb values. However, since the protocol was developed, LOCF was no 
longer considered an appropriate method for dealing with missing values, partly because of concerns of 
underestimation of the variability. This, along with justification based on the specific case of this study 
(notably  that  the  majority  of  missing  values  were  due  to  early  withdrawals  for  renal  transplantation, 
which  was  not  expected  to  be  directly  linked  to  a  systematic  decline  [or  increase]  in  Hb),  led  to  the 
decision to change this method. No imputation was made for missing values in the primary analysis, and 
values after a RBC transfusion were excluded and not imputed. The analysis as specified in the protocol 
was performed as a sensitivity analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 17-
21) 
The changes from baseline to the evaluation period are summarized in the Table 23.  
In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2), age (5-11/12-
18  years),  previous  ESA  treatment  (darbepoetin  alfa/epoetin  alfa  or  beta)  and  baseline  Hb  AUC,  the 
adjusted mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -0.16) 
for Group 1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26) for Group 2 (Table 24). Terms from the model show no 
indication of a strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age.

In Group 2, mean Hb values remained above 10 g/dL and below 12 g/dL throughout the study. However, 
in  the  Group  1  there  was  a  clear  decrease  in  Hb  levels  during  the  titration  period,  with  mean  values 
dropping below 10 g/dL (Figure 17) and reaching a nadir at week 9 before increasing without returning 
to baseline levels at the start of the evaluation period. In both groups, there was a small increase in Hb 
at the beginning of the study from baseline to week 3, although mean levels remained below 12 g/dL 
with a mean increase from baseline of the order of 0.5 g/dL for Group 1 and less than 0.5 g/dL for Group 
2 (see Figure 18). In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 
17 at week 4, and 11 at week 5. 75% of patients were under 12.5 g/dL at week 4, and less than 1.75 
g/dL from their baseline value. The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

During  the  evaluation  period,  in  Group  2,  75%  of  patients  maintained  Hb  values  within  ±  1  g/dL  of 
baseline  and  81%  maintained  Hb  values  within  10-12  g/dL  (in  Group  1,  these  figures  were  58%  and 
75%, respectively) (Table 25). The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 
10-12 g/dL were 69% in Group 2 and 58% in Group 1.

Blood Transfusions during the Core Study Period 
Three patients required blood transfusions during the core study period, one in Group 1 and two in Group 
2 (Table 26). The reasons for transfusion were Hb decreased, procedural hemorrhage, and intracranial 
hematoma. The patient with intracranial hematoma died as a result of the event.

In  both  groups,  mean  reticulocytes  showed  a  cyclic  variation  over  time,  with  peaks  at  week  2, 
subsequently every 4 weeks and with troughs at week 4 to 5 and subsequently every 4 weeks throughout 
the study but otherwise showed no overall tendency to increase or decrease.

Exploratory analyses 
Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period  
A summary of the equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose over time during the core study period is provided 
in Table 27. 
Mean (±SD) 4-weekly Mircera dose increased from 66,64 (±47,348) µg (week 1-4) to 90,45 (±47,232) 
µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 1, and decreased from 163,33 (±99,517) µg (week 1-4) to 161,42 
(±123,065) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 2.  
Median(Q1-Q3) 4-weekly Mircera dose increased from 58,3 (24,5-104,5) µg (week 1-4) to 79,2 (50,0-
124,0) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 1, and decreased from 147,8 (75,0-196,9) µg (week 1-4) to 
117,1 (78,2-220,0) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 2. 
When considering the median values, which are less affected by outliers, in Group 2, the dose decreased 
slightly through to week 13 and then increased for the fifth and final dose at week 17. In Group 1, the 
median dose increased slowly throughout the core study, in response to the course of Hb over time.

Dose ratio between first and evaluation period equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose 
In  Group  2,  the  within-patient  change  in  the  4-weekly  Mircera  dose  during  the  evaluation  period 
compared to their first dose was in general small, as indicated by a median ratio of 1.0 and a mean ratio 
of 1.1. In the case of Group 1, this ratio was larger (median ratio, 1.6; mean ratio, 1.9).

Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period 
The  conversion  factors  for  previously  weekly  ESA  dose  to  equivalent  weekly  Mircera  dose  during  the 
evaluation period are shown in Table 29. 
In  Group  2,  the  median  [IQR]  conversion  factors  were  1.8  [1.4,  2.8]  for  darbepoetin  alfa  and  0.008 
[0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close to the conversion factors used to calculate 
the  first  dose  (1/0.55=1.8  and  1/125=0.008  for  darbepoetin  and  epoetins  respectively).  The  graphs 
show an even distribution either side of the line of these initial dose conversion factors (Figures 19 and 
20).

Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period  
During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% 
of patients in Group 2 and 81% in Group 1 required a dose change) (Table 30). A lower proportion of 
patients  in  Group  2  compared  to  Group  1  required  a  dose  increase  only  during  the  core study  period 
(29% compared to 56%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 required no dose change (23%) 
compared with Group 1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases and 
increases  (38%)  compared  with  Group  1  (13%).  In  terms  of  absolute  numbers  of  dose  changes,  the 
Assessment report

mean number of dose increases and decreases was 1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 
and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2.

Mircera dose during the core study period 
In Group 2, the median equivalent 4-weekly dose during the evaluation period (week 17) was 89 and 
127 µg/4 weeks in the 5-11 years and 12-17 years age groups respectively, whereas the median starting 
doses were 86 and 150 µg/4 weeks (Table 32).

When  considering  the  individual  patient  ratios  of  initial  dose  to  dose  during  evaluation  (Table  33)  in 
Group 2, there was a small increase (1.25) in the medians in the 5-11 age group whereas the ratio was 
close to 1 in the 12-17 age group (0.98). In the younger age group, this corresponds to not more than 
one  protocol  specified  dose  change  of  25%.  In  Group  1,  the  median  ratios  were  both  greater  than  1 
(1.81 for the 5-11 age group and 1.59 for the 12-17 age group). While absolute doses differ, results for 
changes in dose are generally reflected in the smaller Group 1 age subsets. Overall, for Group 1, dose 
increases were required and larger increases were seen in the younger patients and smaller increases in 
the older patients.

Previous ESA treatment 
In Group 1, 8 patients were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 8 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta. 
In Group 2, 26 were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 22 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
When considering changes in Hb over time in Group 2, the mean Hb change from baseline for patients 
previously on darbepoetin alfa was generally below baseline whereas the mean for patients previously 
taking epoetin alfa/beta remained closer to baseline throughout (Figure 22).

the core study period, in the safety extension period, mean values in this group also remained within 
the  10-12  g/dL.  The  change  from  baseline  in  Group  2  during  the  safety  extension  period  fluctuated 
around baseline.

ascertain the optimal starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously for the 
maintenance  treatment  of  anaemia  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on 
dialysis or not yet on dialysis. 
Methods 
The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration (16 
weeks),  and evaluation  (4  weeks).  Patients  completing  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  with  Hb  within  ±1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL, were eligible to enter an optional 
24-week safety extension period. Mircera was administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for the 
duration of the study. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels (according to dose 
adjustment predefined rules).  
Once 12 patients had completed 20 weeks of treatment, an interim analysis to assess efficacy, safety, 
and pharmacokinetics was performed. 
The starting dose was based on conversion factors (CFs) obtained from the dose-finding study (Study 
NH19707).  The  initial  dose  of  Mircera  was  one  of  nine  starting  doses  corresponding  to  the  prefilled 
syringe strengths based on the total weekly ESA dose during the screening period.

Treatments 
Mircera was administered SC once every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. The starting dose was 
based on CFs obtained from the dose-finding study (Study NH19707). 
The initial dose of Mircera was to be one of nine starting doses corresponding to the PFS strengths based 
on the total weekly ESA dose during the screening period, as described below (Table 36): 
Table 36. Mircera Starting Dose NH19708 
The dose of Mircera could be adjusted to maintain the individual patient’s Hb within a target range of ±1 
g/dL of his or her baseline Hb and between 10.0−12.0 g/dL. Dose adjustments were performed at the

scheduled dosing days and was based on the Hb value measured on that day as shown in Table 37. The 
dose adjustments were not to be performed more often than once every 4 weeks. 
Table 37. Mircera Dose adjustments NH19708 
Mircera was provided in sterile injectable solution in single-use pre-filled syringes. The pre-filled syringes 
were available in the following strengths: 
All  treatments  (medications  and  medical  procedures)  were  permitted  before  screening,  during  the 
screening  period  and  throughout  the  20-weeks  treatment  period  except  for:  investigational  medicinal 
product, non-FDA and non-EMA approved biosimilar ESAs within 12 weeks of screening, red blood cell 
(RBC) transfusions within 8 weeks before screening, or immunosuppressive therapies administered in 
the last 12 weeks before the first screening visit. Supplemental iron was administered to prevent iron 
deficiency during the screening period and during study, and to maintain adequate iron parameters.  
Objectives 
Efficacy Objective: To ascertain the starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients 
with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching from stable SC maintenance treatment with 
epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, or darbepoetin alfa. 
Safety Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Mircera given subcutaneously 
in paediatric patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 69/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic  and  Pharmacodynamic  Objective:  To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  and  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  Mircera  in  patients  on  dialysis  or  not  yet  on  dialysis  who  receive  the  study 
medication by the SC route of administration. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
-  Change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  and  the  evaluation  period  for  each 
patient. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
-  Number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ± 1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb or above, within or below the range of 10-12 g/dL. 
-  Change  in  Mircera  dose  over  time,  including  the  change  between  the  starting  dose  and  the 
evaluation period. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics: 
- 
Serum concentrations of Mircera and Hb were used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Mircera through PK and PK/PD models. 
Safety:  
-  Occurrence and severity of adverse events 
-  Change from baseline in targeted vital signs 
-  Change from baseline in targeted clinical laboratory test results 
Sample size 
This study was designed to include 40 paediatric patients. It was planned to include approximately 10-
15 of the patients <12 years old, with the objective to include as many patients as possible <5 years 
old (with a minimum of 3 patients). 
It  was  also  planned  to  include  approximately  10-15  patients,  irrespective  of  age,  who  were  not  on 
dialysis, and no more than 10 patients on HD. 
This  was  an  exploratory  study  without  a  powered  statistical  group  comparison.  Therefore,  no  formal 
sample  size  estimation  was  performed.  However,  the  calculations  below  mentioned  indicate  the 
approximate precision that could be achieved: 
Assuming  a  30%  withdrawal  rate  (based  on  the  withdrawal  rate  for  the  NH19707  study),  of  the  40 
patients evaluable for ITT and safety analysis, more than 26 patients would have data for the evaluation 
period. Twenty-six patients would be sufficient to provide approximately 90% power that the 90% CI 
for  the  Hb  change  from  baseline  to  the  evaluation  period  is  between  -1  and  +1  g/dL,  provided  the 
standard deviation is smaller than 1.5 and the optimum dose conversion is able to maintain the Hb at

the baseline level. This means that we assume there will be no change in the Hb levels from baseline to 
the evaluation period. 
To achieve the recruitment of the intended number of patients and in case of excessive dropout rate, 
additional patients were planned to be enrolled to replace patients not treated for a minimum duration 
of 18 weeks. 
Randomisation 
No randomization was performed. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy variables (original values and change from baseline) over time are presented in summary 
tables and graphically. The estimates are summarized descriptively using means, standard deviations, 
and percentiles. 
The analysis population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses is the ITT population consisting 
of all enrolled patients. 
An  additional  analysis  would  be  performed  based  on  the  per-protocol  population,  which  would  be 
precisely  defined  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan,  before  database  closure,  as  the  subset  of  the  ITT 
population without major protocol deviations. 
Safety data for the whole study including the safety extension period is presented. The safety analysis 
population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug regardless of whether 
they withdrew prematurely or not. 
Mircera serum concentration-time data would be described using non-linear mixed effect modelling. The 
previously developed model was a one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination 
processes. It will be updated with Study NH19708 data. 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP: 
- 
- 
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population. The ITT population consisted of all patients enrolled in the study. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population. The PP population was defined as all patients included in the safety 
population and who have no major protocol deviations as defined below: 
1. Patients with less than 3 Hb values during the evaluation period. 
2. Patients who miss any application of study medication at week 13 or week 17.

4. Patient with wrong Mircera starting dose 
5. Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for: haemoglobin, iron levels, stable dose and 
dosing  interval  of  SC  treatment  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or  biosimilars,  or  darbepoetin 
alfa.

A total of 62 patients were screened, 34 patients were enrolled after initial screening and 28 patients 
failed the screening. Among the 28 screen failure patients, 7 patients were re-screened, 6 patients were 
enrolled, and 1 patient failed the re-screening. 
A total of 40 patients (100%) were enrolled in the core period of the study from 20 centres distributed 
across 7 countries.  
The majority of patients (38 patients [95%]) completed and 2 patients (5%) discontinued during the 
core  period.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  the  core  period  were  kidney  transplant  (1  patient 
[2.5%]) and use of prohibited medication (1 patient [2.5%]). 
A total of 38 patients completed the core period; of these, 25 eligible patients (62.5%) opted to enter 
the safety extension period. Of the 13 patients who did not enter the safety extension, 7 would have 
been  eligible  based  on  Hb  within  10-12  g/dL  and  ±1  g/dL  of  the  baseline  value.  The  majority  of  the 
patients entering the safety extension have completed this period (21 of 25 patients), and 4 patients 
had discontinued. The only reason for discontinuation of patients from the safety extension period was 
kidney transplant (4 patients). 
Recruitment/Numbers analysed 
All ITT patients (40 patients) received at least one dose of the treatment and were included in the safety 
population. Therefore, the ITT and safety population were the same.  
In  the  PP  population,  33  patients  were  included  and  7  patients  were  excluded.  The  main  reasons  for 
exclusion  of  patients  from  the  PP  population  were  overdose  of  Mircera  at  Week  17  (2  patients)  and 
treatment with prohibited concomitant medication (2 patients). 
All 25 patients who entered the optional safety extension period of the study were included in the safety 
extension population. 
To meet the target patient population, no replacement of patients was required to complete the targeted 
sample size in the study.

Baseline data 
The  patients’  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  consistent  with  the  target  patient 
population.  Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  ITT  population  is  included  below  (Table 
40).  
The mean (±SD) weight and height of patients at baseline was 34.21 (21.04) kg and 126.74 (32.95) 
cms, respectively. The median Z-score was negative for both weight (-1.2) and height (-1.6), indicating 
that the patient population had lower weight and height than the normal population for the same age 
and sex, which is as expected in this patient population with anaemia of CKD. 
A similar proportion of patients were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta were 
enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with previous ESA).  
Overall,  there  were  23  male  patients  (57,5%).  The  majority  of  patients  were  caucasian  (30  patients, 
75%), and the mean ± SD age was 10.32 ± 5.69 years. The graphical distribution of patients among 
age categories (Figure 25) (<5, 5-11, ≥12 years) is presented below. 12 patients (30%) were younger 
than 5 years old, 4 of them between 0-2 years old. 
There were 18 patients (45%) who were on peritoneal dialysis, 17 patients (42.5%) who were not on 
dialysis, and 5 patients (12.5%) who were on haemodialysis. The number of patients on haemodialysis 
was comparatively lower than the number of patients not on dialysis or on peritoneal dialysis. This was 
because  to  be  eligible  for  enrolment  in  this  Study  NH19708,  these  patients  had  to  previously  receive 
their ESA treatment SC.  
The mean (±SD) weight and height of patients at baseline was 34.21 (21.04) kg and 126.74 (32.95) 
cms, respectively. The median Z-score was negative for both weight (-1.2) and height (-1.6), indicating 
that the patient population had lower weight and height than the normal population for the same age 
and sex, which is as expected in this patient population with anaemia of CKD.  
A similar proportion of patients were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta were 
enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with each previous ESA).

Previous ESA Therapy  
A similar proportion of patients that were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta 
were enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with each previous ESA).  
The last median (min-max) weekly epoetin alfa/beta dose  before administering the first  Mircera  dose 
was  2000  IU  (range:  375-8000  IU).  The  majority  of  patients  (60%)  received  epoetin  alfa/beta  at  a 
frequency of once a week (8 patients [40%]) or twice a week (4 patients [20%]).  
The last median (min-max) weekly darbepoetin alfa dose before administering the first Mircera dose was 
10 µg (range: 2.5-50 µg). Nine patients (45%) received darbepoetin alfa at a frequency of once every 
two weeks.

Previous and Concomitant Treatments 
All patients (40 patients) were receiving at least one previous treatment at baseline. Previous treatments 
by class taken by ≥ 30% of patients were Vitamin D and analogues (27 patients [67.5%]), calcium (21 
patients [52.5%]), folic acid and derivatives (18 patients [45%]), iron bivalent, oral preparations (16 
patients [40%]), iron trivalent, oral preparations and ACE inhibitors (15 patients [37.5%]), antacids with 
sodium  bicarbonate  and  drugs  for  treatment  of  hyperkalemia  and  hyperphosphatemia  (13  patients 
[32.5%]), and dihydropyridine derivatives (12 patients [30%]). 
All  patients  (40  patients)  continued  receiving  at  least  one  concomitant  treatment  during  the  study 
including  the  extension  period.  The  concomitant  treatment  classes  taken  by  ≥  30%  of  patients  were 
Vitamin D and analogues (29 patients [72.5%]), calcium (22 patients [55%]), folic acid and derivatives 
(19  patients  [47.5%]),  ACE  inhibitors  (18  patients  [45%]),  iron  bivalent,  oral  preparations  and  iron 
trivalent,  oral  preparations  (17  patients  [42.5%]  in  each  class),  drugs  for  treatment  of  hyperkalemia 
and  hyperphosphatemia  (16  patients  [40%]  in  each  class),  dihydropyridine  derivatives  (13  patients 
[32.5%]), antibiotics and antacids with sodium bicarbonate and other antipsoriatics for topical use (14 
patients [35%] in each class), somatropin and somatropin agonists and sulfonamides (12 patients [30%] 
in each class). 
Anticoagulation Treatment  
Two  patients  (5%)  were  receiving  anticoagulation  treatment  at  baseline  and  continued  to  receive  it 
during  the  study.  One  patient  received  enoxaparin  sodium  and  another  patient  received  nadroparin 
calcium. 
Iron Supplementation  
A  majority  of  patients  (35  patients  [87.5%])  were  receiving  iron  supplementation  at  baseline.  Most 
enrolled  patients  (36  patients  [90.0%])  continued  receiving  iron  supplementation  during  the  study 
including the extension period 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Change in Hb concentration (g/dl) between the baseline and the evaluation 
period 
During the evaluation period (weeks 17-21), the data was evaluable for 38 patients. The mean (±SD) 
change in Hb concentration level during the evaluation period showed a 0.48 (1.03) g/dL increase above 
the baseline level. The 90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within 
the protocol specified range of ±1,1 g/dL and the SD was <1.5 g/dL.

Table 45. Haemoglobin values (g/dL) and change from baseline: ITT population 
The mean Hb concentration level was maintained within the targeted range of 10-12 g/dL and the mean 
change  in  Hb  level  was  within  ±1  g/dL  of  the  baseline  Hb  levels.  At  all-time  points,  the  mean  Hb 
concentration levels showed an increase above the baseline levels. 
A total of 3 patients out of the 40 enrolled patients were excluded from the analysis of change in mean 
Hb concentration levels at Weeks 17 and 19: 
-  At Week 17, two patients had discontinued the study and one patient underwent RBC transfusion 
within the previous 3 Weeks of the scheduled visit at Week 17.

Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Patients with Mean Hb within 10-12 g/dL and Change from Baseline within ±1 g/dL during Evaluation 
Period 
During the evaluation period, the data was evaluable for 38 patients (Table 46). The numbers of patients 
who had maintained mean Hb concentration level during the evaluation period were as follows:  
-  24 patients (63.2%) within the range of 10-12 g/dL,  
-  19 patients (50%) within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and  
-  18  patients  (47.4%)  within  both  the  ranges  of  10-12  g/dL  and  ±  1  g/dL  of  the  baseline  Hb 
concentration levels.  
During the evaluation period, few patients had mean Hb concentration levels below 10 g/dL (2 patients 
[5.3%]) or more than 1 g/dL below the baseline mean Hb level (4 patients [10.5%]). There were 15 
patients (39.5%) who had mean Hb concentration levels more than 1 g/dL above the baseline level and 
12 patients (31.6%) had mean Hb level above 12 g/dL.

Mircera dose over time 
Overall, the Mircera dose was decreased over time from the starting dose at Week 1 until Week 17. The 
median was considered for reporting Mircera dose. 
Ratio Mircera Dose: Overall, the median (min-max) ratio of starting dose (Week 1) to the dose at the 
Week 17 was 1.44 (range: 0.2 -3.8), indicating that the Mircera dose was decreased over the course of 
the core study period. Patients who were not administered a Mircera dose at Week 17 visit due to the 
applicable dose adjustment rules were excluded from the ratio computation. There were 5 such patients; 
therefore, at Week 17, the data of 33 patients were available for calculation of the median ratio of Mircera 
dose. 
Mircera Dose in core period: The median (min-max) Mircera dose at Week 1 was 75 µg (range: 15-360 
µg) and it was 50 µg (range: 0-250 µg) at Week 17. This was a median (min-max) decrease by 20 µg 
(−250.0 - 120 µg) compared to the starting dose at Week 1 (Table 49). All patients received a median 
of 5 doses (range: 1-5) of Mircera. The median Mircera dose was 67 µg over a median duration of 16.14 
weeks (range: 0.1-18.3 weeks). 
By body weight and by surface area at Week 17, the median (min-max) Mircera dose decreased by −0.81 
µg/kg (range: −6.3-3.8 µg/kg) and by −20.30 µg/ m2 (range: −182.6-110.4) compared to the starting

Patients with dose adjustments 
Mircera dose adjustments (increase, decrease, or both) were made for the majority of the patients (34 
patients [85%]) during the core period. Five patients (12.5%) did not require any adjustment in their 
Mircera dose. For most of the patients, Mircera dose was decreased (25 patients [62.5%]). The Mircera 
dose was increased in 7 patients (17.5%). The predominant reason for these dose modifications was as 
per  protocol  (33  patients  [82.5%]),  which  allowed  the  Mircera  dose  adjustments  to  maintain  the 
individual  patient’s  Hb  concentration  levels  within  a  target  range  of  10−12  g/dL  or  within  ±1  g/dL  of 
baseline Hb levels. 2 (5%) dose modification was due to a medication error and 3 (7,5%) due to physician 
decision.

During the core study period, a higher proportion of patients in the age group of <5 years (11 patients 
[91.7%]) and 5-11 years (10 patients [90.9%]) required adjustments (increase, decrease, or both) in 
Mircera dose compared with patient in ≥12 years age group (13 patients [76.5%]) during the core period. 
A decrease in the Mircera dose was noted in 7 patients [58.3%]) in the age group of <5 years, 7 patients 
(63.6%) in the age group of 5-11 years, and 11 patients (64.7%) in the age group of ≥12 years.

Efficacy evaluations during the safety extension period 
Haemoglobin over time 
A total of 25 patients who were eligible entered the safety extension period. At baseline, the mean (±SD) 
Hb concentration value was 11.02 (0.53) g/dL. The mean change in Hb values from baseline during the 
safety extension was maintained around baseline (0), indicating stable mean Hb concentration levels.  
In  Group  2,  during  the  safety  extension  period,  all  mean  Hb  values  remained  within  the  10-12  g/dL 
range. In Group 1, although mean values were below this range at some time points during the core

per-patient basis, using an area under the curve (AUC) approach. 
For all analyses concerning Hb, no imputation was made for missing 
values and analysis was performed on observed cases only. 
Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In 
addition, baseline covariate adjusted estimates of Hb change from 
baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were 
calculated from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model.

evaluation periods and taking the difference. 
This per-patient change was then averaged over all patients and the 
confidence intervals calculated.

MH40258 -Real world evidence of safety and dosing of Mircera in children with chronic kidney 
disease 
This is a non-interventional study secondary data use (NIS SDU) and voluntary post-authorization safety 
study (PASS) of paediatric patients from the two existing registries within the International Paediatric 
Dialysis Network (IPDN): International Paediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) and International 
Paediatric  Haemodialysis  Network  (IPHN)  registries.  The  registries  collect  prospective  (baseline  and 
every 6 months) information from paediatric PD and HD centers worldwide.  
The  data  collection  periods  for  this  study  were  from  2007  through  Q2  2021  for  IPPN  and  from  2013 
through Q2 2021 for IPHN.

The study aims to further characterize safety, dosing and related Hb concentrations and to validate the 
dose simulation models of Mircera in paediatric patients (<18 years of age) with anaemia due to CKD in 
a real-world setting. 
Patients aged 0 months to <18 years at initial Mircera visit, on chronic PD or HD were included.  
A total of 229 paediatric dialysis patients (177 PD, 52 HD) receiving Mircera were analysed in this study. 
The median age at first visit was 10.6 (interquartile range 4.2-14.6) years for the PD and 14.1 (10.4-
16.2) years for the HD cohort, respectively. The median observation time under Mircera exposure was 
6.1 (0-12.5) months and 11.9 (0-17.9) months for the PD and HD patients, respectively. More than PD 
patients 50% were from Europe, and almost all HD patients were from Europe (96,2%). 
Safety results- hospitalizations events and deaths 
The safety of Mircera was assessed by aggregate analysis of the hospitalization events and deaths during 
exposure to the drug. Hospitalizations and deaths were monitored from 6 months before the first visit 
under  Mircera  until  the  last  visit  under  Mircera  or,  if  available,  for  6  months  after  the  last  visit  with 
reported Mircera exposure.  
During a median observation time of 13.5 months, 121 (68.4%) PD patients under Mircera had at least 
one hospitalization while using Mircera. There were 5 (2.8%) deaths observed in the PD cohort under 
Mircera. 121 (68.4%) PD patients had at least one hospitalization while using Mircera and a total of 370 
hospitalizations occurred during 270 observation years (calculated as mean observation time * number 
of patients), i.e., 1.37 per year of observation. 77% of the hospitalizations (1.03 per year) were non-
elective. Infections (thereof 56% PD-related) accounted for 85/277 (31%), non-elective PD technique 
complications  for  37/277  (14%),  and  cardiovascular,  fluid  and  electrolyte  complications  for  62/277 
(23%) of the non-elective hospitalizations. The latter included 18 admissions for hypertensive crisis in 
14 patients. 
A  total  of  6  hospitalizations  in  three  patients  were  related  to  anaemia,  including  two  transfusions 
performed in one patient and two episodes of bleeding in another patient. No episodes of thrombotic or 
thromboembolic events were reported in any of the children undergoing PD. 
In  the  HD  cohort,  36  patients  (69.2%)  had  132  hospitalizations  during  83.6  observation  years  while 
using Mircera, corresponding to a rate of 1.58 hospitalization events per year of observation. 106/132 
(80%)  of  these  hospitalizations  (1.27  per  year)  were  non-elective.  43/106  (41%)  of  the  non-elective 
hospitalization events were due to HD technique complications, 30/106 (28%) to infections, and 16/106 
(15%)  to  cardiovascular/fluid  imbalance  events.  10  admissions  in  seven  patients  were  due  to 
hypertensive  crises.  No  access-unrelated  thrombotic  or  thromboembolic  events  and  no  blood 
transfusions were reported. 
Five children in the PD cohort and 2 of the children undergoing HD died while receiving Mircera (i.e. 3% 
of the total population), corresponding to an overall mortality rate of 19.8 cases per 1000 observation 
years.  The  causes  of  death  included  infections  (n=2),  intracranial  bleeding  (n=2),  congestive  heart 
failure (n=2), and one case of sudden death at home.

Haemoglobin concentration and Mircera dose 
The mean (SD) Hb level was 11.0 (1.9) g/dL at first observation and 10.9 (1.7) g/dL at last observation 
under Mircera in the PD cohort, and 10.2 (1.6) g/dL at first and 10.4 (1.7) g/dL at last observation under 
Mircera in the HD group. In both cohorts, Hb levels were stable over time and did not differ by age group. 
At last observation, 46.9% of the children on PD and 48.1% of those on HD had a Hb value in the target 
range of 10-12 g/dL, while 24.9% of PD and 13.5% of HD displayed higher and 28.2% of PD and 38.5% 
of HD patients lower Hb levels. 
In the PD cohort the median (Q1, Q3) Mircera monthly dose at first visit was 100 (50, 120) μg, 3.4 (2.3, 
5.4) μg/kg body weight, or 94 (67, 144) μg/m2 body surface area, and at last visit 100 (50, 150) μg, 
3.5 (2.3, 5.1) μg/kg, or 95 (62, 145) μg/m2. In the HD cohort, the median monthly Mircera dose at first 
visit was 107 (80, 129) μg, 2.9 (1.7, 4.0) μg/kg, or 89 (59, 115) μg/m2, and at last visit 80 (54, 129) 
μg, 2.1 (1.2, 3.4) μg/kg, or 63 (40, 98) μg/m2. 
In general, the absolute monthly Mircera dose increased with age. At the first visit, in the PD cohort, it 
changed from median (interquartile range) 30 (30-100) μg in infants younger than 2 years to 114 (75-
161) μg in the adolescent age group. In the HD cohort it changed from median (interquartile range) 91 
(54-129) μg in children 2 to <5-year-old to 107 (80-129) μg in the adolescent age group. At the last 
visit, in the PD cohort, it changed from median (interquartile range) 50 (30-100) μg in infants younger 
than 2 years to 146 (78-170) μg in the adolescent age group. In the HD cohort it changed from median 
(interquartile range) 91 (54-129) μg in 2 children 2 to <5-year-old to 80 (54-129) μg in the adolescent 
age group. 
While absolute Mircera doses increased with age, the weight-related doses decreased substantially with 
increasing body size in both cohorts. In the children on PD aged <2, 2-<5, 5-<12 and 12-<18 years, 
the median Mircera monthly dose was 7.9 (4.9, 11.6), 5.4 (3.0, 7.5), 3.2 (2.7, 4.9) and 2.6 (1.9, 3.9) 
μg/kg at first observation and 5.1 (3.4, 9.8), 5.2 (2.7, 6.9), 3.0 (2.3, 4.7) and 3.0 (1.7, 4.5) μg/kg at 
last observation. In children on HD aged 2-<5, 5-<12 and 12-<18 years, the median monthly dose was 
6.5 (4.5, 8.6), 4.0 (3.2, 4.9), and 2.2 (1.3, 3.0) μg/kg at first observation and 6.5 (4.5, 8.6), 2.9 (2.1, 
4.0), and 1.5 (0.9, 2.4) μg/kg at last observation, respectively. 
The age-related dosing differences were smaller when doses were normalized to body surface area rather 
than body weight, with median doses at last visit of 114 (69, 218), 121 (69, 166), 87 (62, 120) and 98 
(59, 145) μg/m2/month at <2, 2-<5, 5-<12 and 12-<18 years in the PD cohort and 155 (100, 211), 83 
(59, 104) and 53 (35, 81) μg/m2/month at 2-<5, 5-<12 and 12-<18 years in the HD group. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is an extension of indication to include treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated 
with  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  from  3  months  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  on  ESA  maintenance 
treatment. Mircera is already approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD 
in adult patients and, according to the SmPC, can be used both in adult patients not currently treated 
with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) and in those currently treated with an ESA (epoetins or 
dabepoetin). 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 100/132 
 
 
 
Epoetins  and  darbepoetin  are  usually  given  on  a  weekly  basis  while  Mircera  is  proposed  to  be 
administered every 4 weeks. This, in principle, could be considered an advantage for patients. 
In the clinical development, a paediatric formulation has not been developed, as indicated in the agreed 
PIP. The formulation and strengths used in the paediatric studies supporting this extension of indication 
were those authorised for adults (solution for injection in single-use pre-filled syringes and a number of 
different  strengths).  The  MAH  has  provided  data  to  support  that  few  patients  included  in  the  clinical 
studies received doses below 30 mcg. Due to the rarity of CKD in paediatric patients, it is agreed that 
few patients would have an uncovered need. Furthermore, taking into account the therapeutic indication 
requested (ESA conversion), and the fact that other ESAs are also authorised in vials, this question has 
not  been  further  pursued.  Nevertheless,  as  Mircera  is  manufactured  in  pre-filled  syringes  and  partial 
doses should not be administered due to the risk of medication errors, this has been properly reflected 
in the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 6.6. 
The efficacy of Mircera is based on extrapolation from data adults and on 2 dose finding studies (NH19707 
and  NH19708).  Supportive  data  from  a  non-interventional  study  has  also  been  provided  (study 
MH40258).  Overall,  the  extrapolation  concept  is  acceptable  considering  the  availability  of  PK  data  in 
children  compared  to  adults,  the  data  in  adults  from  adequate  and  controlled  trials  and  that  the 
physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children.  
Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence 
on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population  (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on 
haemodialysis,  following  iv  administration  of  Mircera  after  switching  from  other  ESAs  (i.e.,  epoetin 
alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks 
of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration and continued 4 weeks 
more during the evaluation period.  
This study was exploratory without a powered statistical group comparison. 
The main objective was to determine the optimum starting dose of Mircera in paediatric patients with 
CKD on haemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with other ESA. 
The protocol included two different groups with different conversion factors based on their previous ESA 
dose  to  find  the  optimum  Mircera  starting  dose.  Group  1  comprised  patients  who  started  with  an 
intermediate conversion factor dose. In the adaptive design, this starting dose was assessed. A group 2 
was enrolled for treatment with a higher conversion factor dose, double than that of group 1. Patients 
completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target 
range  of  10-12  g/dL  were  eligible  to  enter  an  optional  52-week  safety  extension  period.  During  this 
period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  with  Hb  concentration 
measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks). 
A total of 112 patients were screened. Of these, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in 
group 2). The mean age was 11 and 13 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Children recruited in Group 
2 were a bit older. The number of patients between 5 to 11 years of age was greater in group 1 than in 
group 2 with a low representation of patients younger than 8 years of age (3 and 2 patients <8 years in 
groups 1 and 2, respectively).

During the evaluation phase, 4 patients in Group 1 and 13 in Group 2 withdrew from treatment due to 
renal transplant. The MAH replaced these patients with new ones in order to maintain the sample size 
planned at the beginning of the study. Baseline characteristics of patients who withdrew and replaced 
patients were similar. Replacement is agreeable taking into account the single-arm study design. Twelve 
patients in group 1 and 35 patients in group 2 completed the evaluation period. Thirty-seven of these 
completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, which was completed by 17 
patients. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period 
and the evaluation period (weeks 17-21). Only results for group 2 were presented, as this was the dose 
conversion factor, proposed also for study NH19708.  
In study NH19707, the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was -0.09 
g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) in group 2. During the evaluation period, 75% of patients maintained Hb 
values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 81% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The 
proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69%. During the core 
phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL. IV 
Mircera  dose  changes  occurred  frequently  (77%  of  patients  in  Group  2),  as  expected  for  patients 
receiving ESA. 
Twenty-eight patients entered the extension study. Overall, the mean dose of Mircera was maintained 
stable  within  the  Hb  range.  These  results  should  be  considered  with  caution  as  there  was  a  high 
withdrawal rate.  
Avoiding/reducing number of transfusions is a relevant goal of the treatment with ESAs. In this study 3 
patients needed blood transfusions, one in Group 1 and 2 in Group 2, due to Hb reduction, procedural 
haemorrhage and intracranial hematoma. Due to the single arm design of the study it is not possible to 
interpret this data. 
Study  NH19708  was  a  phase  II,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter  study  designed  to  ascertain  the 
starting  dose  of  Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  3  months-17  years  paediatric  patients  with  CKD 
anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or dabepoetin 
alfa.  
The  main  objective  was  to  ascertain  the  starting  dose  of  Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  paediatric 
patients with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching from stable SC maintenance treatment 
with other ESA. 
The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration (16 
weeks),  and evaluation  (4  weeks).  Patients  completing  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  with  Hb  within  ±1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL, were eligible to enter an optional 
24-week safety extension period. Mircera was administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for the 
duration of the study. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels. The starting dose 
was based on conversion factors obtained from the dose-finding study (group 2, Study NH19707). 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023

In both studies patients had to be receiving maintenance treatment with ESA therapy at least 8 weeks 
before enrolment with no weekly dose change > 25% (increase or decrease) for at least 4 weeks before 
the first dose of Mircera, IV or SC for studies NH19707 and NH19708, respectively.  
Overall, 64 patients were screened and 40 of them were enrolled. The majority of patients completed 
(95%), and 2 patients discontinued during the core period; the reason for discontinuation were kidney 
transplant  and  use  of  prohibited  medication.  25  eligible  patients  (62.5%)  opted  to  enter  the  safety 
extension period. Of the 13 patients who did not enter the safety extension, 7 would have been eligible. 
Mean age of patients included in study NH19708 was 10.2 years. Twelve (30% patients) were < 5 years, 
11  (27.5%)  5-11  years,  and  17  patients  12-17  years.  A  minimum  enrolment  of  10  patients  below  5 
years was considered of interest by the PDCO to provide the needed PK data. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period 
and the evaluation period (weeks 17-21). The mean change (±SD) in Hb concentration level during the 
evaluation period for study NH19708 showed a 0.48 (1.03) g/dL increase above the baseline level. The 
90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within the protocol specified 
range of ±1.1 g/dL and the SD was <1.5 g/dL. 
During the evaluation period, 50% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the 
baseline levels, and 63.2% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportions of patients with Hb values 
within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 47.4%. 
During  the  evaluation  phase  the  dose  administered  could  be  adjusted  in  order  to  maintain  Hb  levels 
between  10-12  g/dL.  The  mean  dose  was  decreased  over  time  approximately  by  30%.  Furthermore, 
62.5%  of  patients  had  dose  decreases  only,  and  a  considerable  number  of  patients  had  an  Hb  value 
above  the  target  range  (31.6%).  Although  dose  adjustments  are  considered  common  during  ESA 
therapy, results from study NH19708 suggested the conversion factor proposed might not be adequate 
for the switch to the SC route and that the Mircera dose could be too high.  
Theoretical  safety  concerns  have  been  raised  following  the  SC  to  SC  switch  (AEs  related  to  high  Hb 
levels), and the popPK model was updated. Uncertainties of differences in paediatric SC bioavailability 
between other ESAs have been described, and these differences may have an impact on the apparently 
too  high  initial  Mircera  SC  dose.  Results  from  an  additional  analysis  showed  that  the  high  PK  and  PD 
variability for Mircera lead to an overlap on PD outcomes considering or not differences in bioavailability 
between ESAs. However, due to the limitations on the PK/PD model, these results are considered rather 
limited. For practical reasons the high conversion factor for IV to IV and SC to SC switch was the MAH’s 
preferred option, which is acknowledged by the CHMP. However, taking into account that a substantial 
percentage of patients in the SC to SC switch had Hb levels above the upper limit of the accepted range, 
and  the  potential  AEs  related  to  too  high  Hb  levels,  the  intermediate  conversion  factor  is  considered 
more appropriate by the CHMP. Also, this is not expected to affect efficacy due to frequent monitoring 
is still required for these patients, and Mircera dose can be titrated.  
Subgroup analysis, in general, are aligned with primary efficacy results.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  Mircera  is  based  on  extrapolation  from  data  in  adults  and  on  2  dose  finding  studies 
(NH19707  and  NH19708).  Supportive  data  from  a  non-interventional  study  has  also  been  provided 
(study  MH40258).  Overall,  the  extrapolation  is  acceptable  considering  the  availability  of  PK  data  in 
children  compared  to  adults,  the  data  in  adults  from  adequate  and  controlled  trials  and  that  the 
physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children.  
For study NH19707 in which patients on haemodialysis were switched from IV ESA to Mircera IV route 
efficacy  results  show  that  mean  Hb  concentration  level  remained  stable  during  the  evaluation  period. 
These results support the proposed posology as well as the possibility to switch to IV Mircera paediatric 
patients 5 to 17 years of age on haemodialysis who are stabilised with an ESA.  
Results  from  study  NH19708  in  which  patients  were  switched  from  stable  SC  maintenance  treatment 
with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta,  or  darbepoetin  alfa  to  Mircera  SC  route  support  the  SC  use  in  the 
paediatric population (3 months to 17 years of age). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
ESA  therapy  is  an  established  treatment  option  for  alleviate  signs  and  symptoms  associated  with 
anaemia in patients with CKD. However, ESA therapy has been associated with risks, including pure red 
cell aplasia, stroke, vascular access loss and hypertension. In clinical trials, an increased risk of death, 
serious  cardiovascular  events  including  thrombosis  or  cerebrovascular  events  including  stroke  was 
observed when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl.  
The primary safety information in paediatric patients is derived from studies NH19707 and NH19708, 
that  included  patients  5-17  years  old  with  clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anaemia  on  haemodialysis 
treatment and patients 3 months-17 years paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet 
on dialysis, respectively. Patients included in both studies were receiving maintenance treatment with 
an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) prior to switching to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta 
(Mircera). 
The  duration  of  core  period  study  was  20  weeks  and  23  weeks  for  studies  NH19707  and  NH19708, 
respectively. Patients completing the core period with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within 
the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week and 24-week safety extension 
period, respectively. 
After the first administration of Mircera, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, 
which were measured once a week during the core study period and once every four weeks during the 
safety extension. 
The clinical safety of Mircera in paediatric patients is further supported  by analysis of post-marketing 
adverse event (AE) reports and data from international registries recording use of Mircera in paediatric 
patients as well as reports of paediatric Mircera use in the literature.

Patient exposure 
Study NH19707 
A total of 64 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera in this study. The extent of exposure 
(core study and safety extension) is summarized in Table 60. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera 
for at least 15 months. 
Table 60. Summary of patient exposure, including safety extension period of study NH19707: 
Safety population 
During the core study period, the median cumulative total dose of Mircera was 466 µg in the Group 2 
and 207 µg in the Group 1. The highest single, individually injected dose was 560 µg received by patient 
3504, equivalent to 11.4 µg/kg with a total cumulative dose of 1950 µg. The highest cumulative dose 
was 2000 µg, from patient 6603, who regularly received 450 µg or 9 µg/kg.  
Throughout  the  entire  study  (including  the  safety  extension  period),  the  median  number  of 
administrations was 5.5 in Group 1 and 7.5 in Group 2. Four patients in Group 1 (25%) and 7 patients 
in Group 2 (15%) received at least 18 administrations and one in Group 2 received 19. 
Study NH19708 
A total of 40 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera in this study. The extent of exposure 
(core study and safety extension) is summarized in Table 61.  
Overall, the patients received a median of 5 Mircera administrations (range: 1-5 administrations) during 
the core period. The majority of patients (38 patients [95%]) received at least 5 Mircera administrations.

Table 62. Summary of Adverse Events Reported in the core period of study NH19707: Safety 
population 
The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  >  15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and 
infestations (30/64 patients overall [47%]), General disorders and administration site conditions (12/64 
patients  [19%]),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/64  patients  overall  [19%])  and  Nervous  system 
disorders (12/64 patients [19%]). 
The  individual  AEs  reported  in  more  than  5%  of  patients  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (9/64  patients 
overall  [14%]),  headache  (9/64  [14%]),  vomiting  (6/64  patients  [9%]),  hypertension  (8/64  patients 
overall  [13%]),  abdominal  pain  (4/64  patients  overall  [6%]),  and  bronchitis  (4/64  patients  overall 
[6%]).  
Adverse events with a frequency ≥ 2% by SOC during the core period is shown in Table 63. Most of the 
AEs  were  associated  with  CKD,  other  previous  and  concurrent  risk  factors/diseases  and  treatments, 
and/or dialysis-induced, and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Seven  AEs  in  5/64  patients  (8%)  overall  (1  AE  [decreased  Hb]  in  1  patient  in  Group  1  and  6  AEs 
[arteriovenous 
fistula 
thrombosis, 
extensive 
interdialytic  weight 
gain, 
hyperkalemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, dental caries, thrombosis in device] in 4 patients in Group 2) were considered by 
the investigator to be related to the study drug.

Table  63.  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  (≥2%  of  patients  overall)  by  SOC  during  the  Core 
Period of Study NH19707: Safety Population. 
Overall,  there  were  2  life-threatening  AEs  (both  in  group  2,  intracranial  hematoma  and  procedural 
haemorrhage, not related with treatment) and 10 severe AEs in 7/64 patients (11%), 4 of which were 
not classified as SAEs during the core study period. Of the remaining AEs, there were 42 moderate AEs 
in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients (55%). 
The only severe AE to be reported more than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2 patients, 1 
in each group). One of these cases was classified as an SAE, and both were considered related to the 
study drug by the investigator. The only other severe AE considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator were hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia.

Safety extension period 
During the safety extension period, 27 patients (73%) experienced at least one AE (4 [44%] in Group 1 
and 23 [82%] in Group 2) (Table 64). 
Table  64.  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  Reported  in  the  safety  extension  period  of  study 
NH19707: Safety population 
The most frequently reported events were Infections and infestations (17 patients overall [46%] had an 
AE in this SOC) and Gastrointestinal disorders (8 patients [22%]).  
The most frequently reported individual AEs overall were headache (6 [16%]), hypertension (5 [14%]) 
and nasopharyngitis (7 [19%]).  
Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: 
anaemia and urinary tract infection. 
Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension period 
(all  in  patients  in  Group  2).  These  events  were  hypotension,  hypertension,  arteriovenous  fistula 
thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the investigator 
to be related to the study drug. 
Study NH19708 
Core period 
A majority of patients (32 patients [80%]) experienced at least one AE (Table 65). A total of 106 AEs 
were reported during the core period. A total of 13 patients (32.5%) experienced SAEs; however, none 
of  these  SAEs  was  considered  related  to  Mircera  treatment  by  the  investigator  and  none  resulted  in 
withdrawal or dose modification/interruption. No deaths were reported. 
AEs of severe intensity were reported in 6 patients (15%). Two patients (5%) each reported related AEs 
and AEs leading to dose modification/interruption. One patient required blood transfusion (2.5%).

Table 65. Adverse Events - Core Period: Safety Population 
The SOCs in which AEs were experienced by ≥ 15% patients were Infections and infestations (25 patients 
[62.5%]),  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  and  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders  (7  patients  [17.5%]  in  each  SOC),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  and  General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (6 patients [15%] in each SOC). 
The most frequent AEs experienced by ≥5% patients were upper respiratory tract infection (5 patients 
[12.5%]),  accidental  overdose  (4  patients  [10%]),  oropharyngeal  pain,  pyrexia,  gastroenteritis, 
peritonitis  (3  patients  [7.5%]  in  each  PT),  and  anaemia,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  bronchitis, 
conjunctivitis,  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  hyperphosphataemia,  headache,  and  hypertension  (2 
patients [5%] in each PT). 
A  total  of  4  patients  were  reported  with  accidental  overdoses  in  the  study.  Two  accidental  overdoses 
were because of an issue with the functioning of IXRS system. The remaining two accidental overdoses 
were due to medical error and did not exceed 25% of the dose that should have been administered. In 
all 4 patients the Mircera dose was corrected at the next visit and the overdosing had no safety impact. 
During the core period, two patients experienced 3 AEs of administration site pain and ecchymosis (1 
patient  [2.5]),  and  injection  site  pain  (1  patient  [2.5%])  considered  to  be  related  to  Mircera  by  the 
investigator.

The majority of patients (25 patients [62.5%]) experienced AEs of WHO Grade 1-2. The AEs of WHO 
Grade 3-4 was experienced by 6 patients (15%): 2 patients (5%) experienced Grade 3 AEs and 4 patients 
(10%) experienced Grade 4 AEs. 
Two patients experienced a total of 3 Grade 3 SAEs of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis (1 patient 
[2.5%]), and peritonitis and device malfunction (1 patient [2.5%]). All 3 SAEs were considered unrelated 
to Mircera by the investigator and had resolved. 
Four  patients  experienced  a  total  of  4  Grade  4  SAEs  of  gastroenteritis,  appendicitis,  anaemia 
postoperative, and pneumonia (1 patient [2.5%] in each PT). All 4 SAEs were considered unrelated to 
Mircera by the investigator. Except for gastroenteritis, all the remaining Grade 4 AEs had resolved by 
the end of core period.

Safety extension period 
A total of 16 patients (64%) experienced at least one AE in the safety extension period (Table 67). A 
total of 53 AEs were reported in the safety extension period. Three patients (12%) each experienced 
SAEs and AEs of severe intensity. One patient (4%) experienced an AE considered related to Mircera by 
the  investigator.  One  patient  (4%)  required  blood  transfusion.  None  of  the  patients  experienced  AEs 
leading  to  treatment  withdrawal  or  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification/interruption  during  the  safety 
extension period. 
No major difference was noted in the pattern of AEs between the core and safety extension period. 
The SOCs in which AEs were experienced by ≥ 15% patients were Infections and infestations (8 patients 
[32%]), and General disorders and administration site conditions (5 patients [20%]).  
The most frequent AEs experienced by ≥5% patients were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, pyrexia, rhinitis, muscle spasms, hypotension, and headache (2 patients [8%] in each PT). 
During the safety extension period, one patient experienced an AE of injection site pain (1 patient [4%]) 
considered to be related to Mircera by the investigator. 
Table 67. Adverse Events – Safety Extension Period: Safety Population 
The pattern of AEs by intensity was similar between the core and safety extension period.  
The  AEs  of  WHO  Grade  1-2  were  experienced  by  12  patients  (48%)  and  WHO  Grade  3-4  AEs  were 
experienced by 3 patients (12%). One patient (4%) experienced a non-serious Grade 3 AE of pyrexia 
and  had  resolved.  Two  patients  (8%)  experienced  2  SAEs  of  Grade  4  hypotension  and  anaemia 
postoperative, both the SAEs had resolved.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Study NH19707 
One  patient  died  during  the  study  (in  the  core  study  period).  The  cause  of  death  was  reported  as 
intracranial hematoma. The patient had experienced head trauma as a result of a domestic accident. 
Study NH19708 
No deaths were reported in the study. 
Serious adverse event 
Study NH19707 
Core period 
Overall, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs during the core study period (4/16 [25%] in 
Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2).  
Of  the  AEs  classified  as  serious,  two  were  considered  related  to  study  medication:  arteriovenous 
thrombosis and thrombosis in device. 
Safety extension period 
Overall, 9/37 patients (24%) reported a total of 12 SAEs during the safety extension period (1/9 [11%] 
in Group 1 and 8/28 [29%] in Group 2). Of the AEs classified as serious, none were considered related 
to the study medication. 
Study NH19708 
During the core period 13 patients (32.5%) experienced a total of 23 SAEs and 3 patients experienced 
a total of 4 SAEs in the safety extension period. All SAEs were considered unrelated to Mircera treatment 
by the investigator. 
Other significant events 
Hypertension 
Study NH19707 
Core period 
Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as one of the risk 
factors  for  vascular  events  and  hemorrhage  and  37  (58%)  were  already  receiving  or  had  received 
Assessment report

antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During the core study period, 8 patients (13%) had an increase 
in antihypertensive treatment. 
Of the 8 patients with arterial hypertension reported as an AE during the core study period, 7 had pre-
existing hypertension at enrolment or within 12 weeks prior to enrolment, and 1 had previously received 
antihypertensive therapy although this patient was not reported to have hypertension at enrolment or 
within 12 weeks of enrolment. In 1 patient, hypertension was reported as severe in intensity and as an 
SAE. The event resolved with treatment (doxazosin and carvedilol). One case of moderate hypertension 
was also reported as an SAE. Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure measurements were performed in all 
patients during the study.  
Values remained close to baseline level, and no clear trend or difference between groups was apparent 
during the study. 
Safety extension period 
During  the  safety  extension  period,  9  patients  (24%)  had  increased  antihypertensive  treatment 
compared with baseline (5 of these already had increased antihypertensive treatment in the core period).  
There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with hypertension 
in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core period. In that 
patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in antihypertensive treatment was 
reported after the second event.  
During the extension period, two patients reported  hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event 
was associated with a change in antihypertensive medication. 
Study NH19708 
At study entry, a total of 21 patients (52.5%) had hypertension.  
During the core period, after initiating Mircera treatment, 2 patients reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 
2 AEs of hypertension. One patient reported 2 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of hypertension and 1 patient 
reported 1 non serious, Grade 2 AE of hypertension. All 3 hypertension AEs were considered unrelated 
to Mircera treatment by the investigator and resolved with treatment. 
No patients experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period. 
Overall, in all patients, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP showed small variation across all visits 
compared to the median score at baseline during core and safety extension period. 
Vascular Access Thrombosis (VAS) 
Study NH19707 
Core Study Period  
During the core study period, 4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5 events that may be 
classified as vascular access thrombosis. These events were defined as ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ 
in 2 patients and ‘thrombosis in device’ in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events).  
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 116/132 
 
 
 
All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 cases 
(one case of ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ and one case of ‘thrombosis in device’) were considered 
related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae. 
Safety Extension Period  
During the safety extension period, 3 patients reported 5 events classified as vascular access thrombosis 
(different  patients  from  those  with  such  events  during  the  core  period).  These  were  coded  as 
‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ in 2 cases and ‘thrombosis in device’ in 3 cases.  
Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device’ in 1 patient and 1 report of ‘arteriovenous 
fistula thrombosis’ in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events (’arteriovenous fistula 
thrombosis’) was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered related to study medication 
and all resolved without sequelae. 
Study NH19708 
One patient experienced a total of 9 AEs of VAS. Of these 9 events, one was a serious Grade 2 AE and 
8 were non-serious. All were considered unrelated to Mircera treatment by the investigator. From Day 
128 to day 277, this patient had recurrent thrombosis in device. The patient changed dialysis modality 
from PD to HD on study day 127 due to PD catheter malfunction. 
Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia 
Study NH19707 
No  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  or  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies  during  the  study.  No 
patients developed PRCA. 
Study NH19708 
Two patients tested positive for anti-EPO antibodies. No effect on Hb or Mircera doses were seen and no 
AE of PRCA was reported. 
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
Study NH19707 
Hematology  
In  this  study,  Hb  concentrations,  reticulocytes,  and  red  blood  cell  counts  were  considered  part  of  the 
efficacy assessment. One patient had a moderate AE of Hb decreased due, according to the investigator, 
to the latency effect of Mircera. This AE resolved.  
In clinical trials of Mircera in adults, slight decreases in platelet counts have been observed. In study 
NH19707,  median  platelet  count  at  baseline  was  221.5  x  109/L  (range  182-398)  and  208.0  x  109/L 
(range 80-518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period 
in both groups but remained within 16% and 20% of baseline, respectively. There was substantial within 
and between-patient variability of platelets in both groups. In Group 1, 1/16 patients had one or more 
postbaseline values below the site-specific normal range (typically 150-400 × 109/L). None had values 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023

above  normal  range.  In  Group  2,  19/47  patients  had  one  or  more  postbaseline  values  below  normal 
range, of whom 6/19 already had low values at baseline, and 4/47 patients had one or more postbaseline 
values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline.  
During  the  extension  period,  platelet  values  below  the  site-specific  normal  range  were  reported  in  2 
patients (29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2.  
No events of bleeding were reported in any patients who had one or more post-baseline platelet counts 
below  normal.  Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  four  patients;  in  all  cases,  the  event  was 
classified as mild and unrelated to study drug.  
During the core study period, median haematocrit remained within 15% of baseline for both groups and 
remained stable during the safety extension period.  
Chemistry 
Over  the  entire  study  period,  median  changes  from  baseline  for  aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine 
aminotransferase,  serum  albumin,  calcium,  blood  glucose  parameters,  as  well  as  for  potassium  and 
phosphate,  were  minor,  with  no  obvious  trends  over  time.  Abnormal  post-baseline  values  for  these 
parameters  were  observed  only  sporadically.  The  only  abnormalities  in  these  parameters  reported  as 
AEs were hyperkalemia (4 patients in total), hyperphosphatemia (3 patients in total) and hypocalcemia 
(1 patient in total). Two of these AEs were reported as severe (hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia).  
Post  baseline  values  ≥  800  U/L  were  seen  at  some  timepoint  throughout  the  study  for  alkaline 
phosphatase in 4 and 3 patients in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. None of these abnormalities were 
associated with AEs.  
C-reactive protein  
Median  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  levels  remained  close  to  or  below  the  baseline  value  throughout  the 
study.  The  majority  of  patients  had  normal  CRP  levels  at  baseline  and  these  values  remained  within 
normal range throughout the study. None of these patients experienced AEs.  
Iron parameters  
In Group 2, the largest median changes from baseline were observed at Week 13 for iron (+6.75 μM/L 
from 12.00 μM/L at baseline), at Week 61 for ferritin (245.38 μg/L from 328.00 μg/L for ferritin) and 
Week 53 for transferrin saturation (13.11% from 26.82% at baseline). A similar pattern was observed 
in Group 1. In all cases, median values for these parameters remained within normal values. Two patients 
reported AEs related to iron parameters: iron deficiency and iron overload. Neither of these events was 
considered related to Mircera.  
Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety  
During the core period, plots of pre-dialysis Z scores for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure  (DBP)  showed  no  clear  trend  throughout  the  study,  with  median  Z  scores  within  ±  1  of  the 
baseline. During the safety extension period, changes from baseline remained small in Group 2. Group 
1 showed greater fluctuation, particularly after Week 57, although this may be a consequence of the low 
patient numbers.  
Assessment report

In  both  dose  groups  approximately  60%  of  patients  had  at  least  three  consecutive  predialysis  and 
postdialysis  SBP  or DBP values  at  or above  the  age,  sex,  and weight  specific  95th  percentile.  Median 
sitting pulse rate did not change by more than 10 bpm with respect to baseline at any time during the 
study. 
Changes in height and weight 
Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth. 
Study NH19708 
Hematology  
In  this  study,  Hb  concentrations,  reticulocytes,  and  red  blood  cell  counts  were  considered  part  of  the 
efficacy assessment.  
Mean Hb concentrations raised during the study period although Mircera dose was decreased. This should 
be further discussed (See efficacy MO/OC). 
The red blood cell count was consistent as expected in patients with anemia due to CKD at baseline. The 
median RBC count showed a slight improvement over time during the core and safety extension period. 
No clinically significant change was noted in the platelet count during the core period. Overall, a slight 
decrease in median platelet count was noted in all visits from the baseline value of 262.50 × 109 / L to 
235  ×109/L  at  Week  21  and  to  234  ×10  9/L  at  Week  45  but  was  within  the  normal  range  during  the 
entire study period.  
One patient showed a shift in platelet values from normal to low post baseline and 2 patients shifted 
from normal to high post baseline value. The patient with shift from normal to low post baseline value 
did not have any AE related to low platelet count. 
Chemistry 
No major change in median values was noted for albumin (g/L), alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, and 
calcium over the course of the study. Although there were a few patients who had shifts from normal to 
low or high for these analytes, these were not clinically significant.  
Serum electrolytes (phosphorus and potassium) showed a minor change in median values from baseline. 
A total of 14 patients (35%) and 10 patients (25%) shifted from normal to high during the study for 
phosphorous and potassium, respectively. However, these changes in serum electrolytes or phosphorous 
and potassium were not clinically significant. 
C-reactive protein  
A decrease in median (min-max) C-reactive protein levels was noted across all visits from baseline value 
(2.40 mg/L [range: 0.0 - 145.0 mg/L]) to Week 21 (1.75 mg/L, [range: 0.0 - 84.0 mg/L]); however, 
there  was  no  major  change  noted  at  Week  45  (2.66  mg/L  [range:  0.0  -  16.2  mg/L])  compared  to 
baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 119/132 
 
 
 
The  majority  of  patients  (25  patients  [62.5%])  had  normal  CRP  levels  post  baseline.  Seven  patients 
(17.5%)  shifted  from  normal  to  high CRP  levels.  These  changes  in  C-reactive  protein  levels  were  not 
clinically significant. 
Iron parameters  
Overall, the iron parameters were increased but remained within the normal range throughout the study 
period.  
The median baseline value for iron was 14.98 µmol/L (range: 6.5-24.5 µmol/L). The lowest and highest 
median change from baseline in iron was 2.82 µmol/L (range: −14.2 - 26.4) and 5.08 µmol/L (range: 
−12.1- 35) at Week 29, respectively.  
The median baseline value for ferritin was 139.65 ng/mL (range: 18.9 - 939.5 ng/mL). The lowest and 
highest median change from baseline  in ferritin was 13.66 ng/mL (range: -375.0 -  300.1) and 47.30 
ng/mL (range: −379.0 - 673.2) at Week 37 and Week 21, respectively.  
The median baseline value for transferrin saturation was 29.95% (range: 10.9%- 46.2%). The lowest 
and highest median change from baseline in transferrin saturation was 4.24% (range: -24.7 – 64%) and 
9.64% (range: −20.8 - 139.8%) at Week 17 and Week 29, respectively.  
Dialysis Modality Over Time  
Three  patients  (7.5%)  had  dialysis  modality  change  in  the  study.  All  three  patients  changed  to 
haemodialysis. 
Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety  
At  baseline,  the  median  Z-score  was  0.99  for  SBP  and  0.71  for  DBP  in  patients  not  on  dialysis/on 
peritoneal  dialysis  (above  values  in  the  reference  population).  During  the  core  and  safety  extension 
period, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP showed small variation (within ±1 of baseline) across 
all visits compared to the median score at baseline; the greatest change was 0.37 at Week 5 for SBP 
and −0.33 at Week 17 for DBP. 
In haemodialysis patients, the pre-dialysis baseline median Z-score was 1.16 for SBP, suggesting slightly 
higher pre-dialysis median SBP than the mean SBP in the reference population. The pre-dialysis baseline 
median Z-score was 0.28 for DBP. The post-dialysis baseline median Z-score was 0.78 for SBP and −0.18 
at DBP. 
In haemodialysis patients during the pre-dialysis assessments, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP 
showed small variation (within ±1 of baseline) across all visits compared to the median score at baseline 
during the core period; during the safety extension period BP showed greater variation at the later visits 
compared  to  the  median  score  at  baseline.  The  MAH  justifies  these  large  variations  during  safety 
extension period due to low number of patients. 
Changes in height and weight 
Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth.

Immunogenicity 
Study NH19707 
No patients tested positive for erythropoietin antibodies or anti-drug antibodies at any time during the 
study, including the safety extension period. 
Study NH19708 
Blood samples were collected for anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing at Week 1, 9, 21 and 45. In all patients 
a total of 131 samples were tested for anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Overall, two samples tested 
positive  for  anti-Mircera  antibodies  and  four  samples  tested  positive  for  anti-EPO  antibodies  in  two 
patients. 
In one patient, the Week 21 sample tested positive for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies with 
titers of 1:1.56 and 1:29.8, respectively. The earlier Week 9 sample from this patient tested negative 
for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Since the baseline (Week 1) and end-of-study (Week 45) 
samples for this patient were unfit for analysis due to incorrect handling there was no way of knowing 
the  initial  or  final  status  of  this  patient.  The  patient  was  recalled  for  an  additional  ADA  sample 
approximately 7 months after the end of study visit. The patient had continued to be treated with Mircera 
off-label after participation in the study ended. The samples taken during patient recall tested negative 
for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. During the period of study participation, Hb and Mircera 
doses were stable.  
In the other patient, the Week 1 sample tested positive for anti-Mircera antibodies with a titer of 1:1.32. 
and anti-EPO antibodies with a titer of 1: 1.56. The patient tested positive for anti-Mircera at Week 1 
although  he  had  never  been  treated  with  Mircera  before  study  enrolment.  The  same  patient  tested 
positive for anti-EPO antibodies at weeks 9 and 21 with titers of 1:3.20, and 1:8.77, respectively. Anti-
Mircera antibodies tested negative at these time points. Subsequent samples taken at Week 45 tested 
negative for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. 
In both of these patients, there was no evidence of PRCA and both continued to show response to Mircera 
treatment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study NH19707 
One patient died and did not complete study treatment during the core study period. No patients were 
withdrawn from study treatment due to a non-fatal AE in either study period. 
No AEs led to dose modification at any time during the study.  
Study NH19708 
None of the patients experienced any AE that led to withdrawal of the study treatment during the core 
or extension period.

Two patients (5%) experienced one non-serious AE each of Grade 2 anaemia during the core period. 
Both the AEs required Mircera dose to be increased. Both the AEs were considered to be unrelated to 
Mircera treatment by the investigator and had resolved. 
Supportive data 
In addition to the safety data derived from clinical studies, the MAH has provided data from supportive 
paediatric registry study MH40258 (see supportive studies in clinical efficacy).  
As reported by the MAH, the drug is well tolerated with long-term exposure. In adults, safety data from 
long-term exposure (BA16528 and BH21260) did not reveal any safety concerns and safety of Mircera 
was consistent with the known profile of Mircera.  
The MAH also claims the long-term safety of the drug in paediatric patients is further supported by data 
from  other  ESAs.  Schaefer  et  al.,  2016  has  published  the  outcomes  of  long-term  treatment  (up  to  2 
years) in children with darbepoetin alfa. In that study, which included 319 patients aged from < 1 years 
upwards (approximately half not yet on dialysis), no new safety signals were identified.  
Additional safety issues 
Several pegylated products have been assessed by CHMP for marketing authorization. PEG accumulation 
has been discussed thoroughly by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) with a positive benefit/risk balance for adolescents and adults (age >12 
years).  The  major  issue  for  this  age  restriction  was  the  limited  efficacy,  which  did  not  outweigh  the 
(theoretical) risk of the vacuolisation.  
Following the CHMP request, a discussion has been provided by the MAH regarding the biodistribution of 
the PEGylated drug product and the risk of vacuolation due to mPEG accumulation in choroid plexus and 
other tissues, and the risk for the paediatric population. In vivo distribution data indicated that Mircera 
can  reach  the  brain,  but  at  low  levels,  and  it  should  be  considered  that  PEG-induced  cell  vacuolation 
observed in toxicity studies performed with other PEGylated medicinal products were not associated to 
functional consequences. Furthermore, clinical experience with Mircera in adults and paediatric patients 
also did not raise any safety concerns pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation. As a consequence, no 
safety concern is expected related to PEG accumulation with Mircera (see non-clinical aspects).  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
ESA therapy is an established treatment option to alleviate signs and symptoms associated with anaemia 
in  patients  with  CKD.  However,  ESA  therapy  has  been  associated  with  risks,  including  pure  red  cell 
aplasia,  stroke,  vascular  access  loss  and  hypertension.  In  clinical  trials,  an  increased  risk  of  death, 
serious  cardiovascular  events  including  thrombosis  or  cerebrovascular  events  including  stroke  was 
observed when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl.  
The primary safety information in paediatric patients is derived from studies NH19707 and NH19708, 
that  included  patients  5-17  years  old  with  clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anaemia  on  haemodialysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 122/132 
 
 
 
treatment and patients 3 months-17 years paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet 
on dialysis, respectively. Patients included in both studies were receiving maintenance treatment with 
an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) prior to switching to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta 
(Mircera). 
During the whole study NH19707, the cumulative total exposure was 45.5 patient-exposure-year (PEY) 
with a mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera for at least 15 months. 
During study NH19708, a total of 40 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera. Overall, 
the patients received a median of 11 Mircera administrations (range: 1-11 administrations) during the 
core  and  safety  extension  periods.  Twenty-two  patients  [55%])  received  at  least  11  Mircera 
administrations.  
Overall, the safety data set in the paediatric population is rather limited. It is acknowledged that this 
disease  is  uncommon  in  children  and  that  the  paediatric  population  tolerate  better  the  anaemia  and 
therefore are less likely to be treated with ESA. Also, limited data from patients <1 year is available. 
Considering  the  nature  of  the  patients  with  symptomatic  anaemia  associated  with  CKD,  the 
physiologically normal low kidney function is not regarded as an issue, as ESA response is not influenced 
by  the  function  or  immaturity  of  the  kidneys,  but  it  is  by  the  severity  of  kidney  impairment.  Also, 
considering the shift to Mircera is occurring in patients in stable maintenance, monthly Hb monitoring 
and dose adjustments will allow to adapt doses to each patient. Although, considering long-half-life of 
Mircera, fragility of paediatric population, and limited low-doses available presentations, it is considered 
that ESA-treated patients <1 year of age should only be switched if there is a compelling need for the 
switch. This has been reflected in the SmPC (section 4.4). Furthermore, lower doses than 30 µg cannot 
be administered with the prefilled pens. A warning has been included in the SmPC to reflect that subjects 
with  stabilized  Hb  and  with  an  expected  need  of  lower  doses  of  Mircera  than  30  µg  should  not  be 
switched. 
Safety results from this phase II studies showed that 77% and 73% of patients in the core period and 
safety extension period reported at least one adverse event in study NH19707, and 80% and 64% of 
patients  in  the  core  period  and  safety  extension  period  in  study  NH19708  respectively.  These 
percentages seem lower than those obtained from pooled phase II/III trials conducted in adult patients 
with chronic renal anaemia where around 88% of patients reported at least one adverse event.  
The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  >15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and 
infestations,  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, administration 
site conditions and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]). 
The adverse events considered related to treatment in paediatric patients (study NH19707) were 7.8% 
in the core period and 5.4% in the extension period, and 5.0% and 4.0% for the same periods in study 
NH19708, respectively. For adult patients (pooled phase II/III trials) this data was around 6%.  
One death occurred during study NH19707 due to intracranial hematoma related to head trauma in a 
domestic accident that was considered unrelated to treatment.

In the evaluation period of study NH19707, 25% of patients (12/48) reported SAEs in Group, 2 were 
considered serious, and 2 were considered related to study medication: arteriovenous thrombosis and 
thrombosis in device. During the extension phase none were considered related to the study medication. 
During NH19708 13 patients (32.5%)  experienced  23 SAEs and three 4 SAEs in the safety extension 
period. None was considered related to Mircera treatment by the investigator. 
Hypertension, vascular access thrombosis and anti-erythropoietin antibody-induced pure red cell aplasia 
(AEAB-PRCA) as potential safety concerns. These adverse events, along with decrease in platelet count 
and thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism), were considered of special interest during 
the clinical  development  of Mircera in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia and are  described as 
adverse events in the product information. 
During the evaluation period in study NH19707, 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse 
event,  7  of  which  showed  hypertension  prior  to  inclusion  in  the  study.  The  other  one  had  previously 
received  antihypertensive  therapy.  Two  of  these  cases  reported  (3.1%)  were  classified  as  serious 
adverse events, and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period of 
study  NH19707  five  patients  (13.5%)  reported  hypertension,  however  two  (5.4%)  was  classified  as 
serious and not related to the study medication. 
During the core period in study NH19708, 2 patients (5%) reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of 
hypertension,  that  were  considered  unrelated  Mircera  and  resolved  with  treatment.  No  patients 
experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period. One patient (2,5%) reported a 
total of 9 AEs of vascular access thrombosis in study NH19708; all of them were considered unrelated 
to treatment, and one was a serious grade 2 AE. 
As with other ESA, blood pressure can increase during treatment and should be monitored while on ESA, 
and uncontrolled hypertension is a contraindication in the SmPC of Mircera. However, given the single-
arm, open label nature of the studies it is difficult to conclude on the contribution of Mircera to these 
increases of blood pressure. 
Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis in study NH19707 (2 patients (3.1%) described as 
thrombosis in device and 2 patients (3.1%) as arteriovenous fistula thrombosis). All cases were classified 
as serious adverse events but only two of them were considered related to the study medication (one 
case each). During the safety extension period of study NH19707 arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and 
thrombosis in device were reported in 2 patients each (5.4%). Two of them were classified as serious 
adverse event (one arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and the other one thrombosis in device) and none 
of them was considered related to the study drug.  
No  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  or  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies  during  Study  NH19707, 
neither pure red cell aplasia. Two patients tested positive for anti-EPO antibodies in study NH19708. No 
effect on Hb or Mircera doses were seen and no AE of PRCA was reported. 
In study NH19708 mean Hb concentrations raised during the study period although Mircera dose was 
decreased. Mircera dose decreases were greater in younger patients. Following these safety concerns, 
the popPK model was updated (see Clinical efficacy section). Results for an additional analysis showed 
that the high variability PK and PD for Mircera lead to an overlap on PD outcomes between considering 
Assessment report

Page 124/132 
 
 
 
or not differences in bioavailability between ESAs, and, taking into account frequent monitoring is still 
required for these patients, the clinical impact could be considered not relevant. 
In both studies platelet count decreased along evaluation the extension phase. This had been previously 
observed  in  adult  treated  patients.  No  bleeding  events  were  reported  in  any  patients  who  had  post-
baseline platelet counts below normal range.  
In addition to the safety data derived from Study NH19707, the MAH has provided data from a paediatric 
registry study MH40258. No new safety concerns have been reported. 
According to the data provided the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population seems similar to 
that of adults and no new AEs have been identified. 
Nevertheless, clinicians should be warned that Hb level fluctuations may occur after conversion, and a 
warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  has  been  included  to  reflect  that  after  ESA  conversion,  a 
monthly/every 4-week Hb control is recommended (similar to the recommendation during ESA initiation 
therapy). 
Given the information coming from non-clinical studies related to other PEGylated products, there is a 
possible risk of accumulation of PEG causing vacuolation in tissues such as brain, liver and kidney as 
seen  in  animals.  The  implication  of  this  finding  in  humans  is  at the  time  being  unclear.  Following  the 
CHMP request, the MAH has included a discussion of the potential concerns for use of Mircera, which is 
a  PEGylated  medicinal  product  in  paediatric  patients.  Results  provided  support  that  Mircera  is  not 
expected to cause any safety concern as consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation 
to the CNS and other tissues (see non-clinical assessment). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
According to the data provided the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population appears to be 
similar to that of adults as no new safety adverse events have been identified. The safety database is 
quite limited, especially in the youngest children and especially in patients <1 year. However, considering 
clinical  experience  of  Mircera  in  adult  patients,  and  the  similar  safety  profile  of  Mircera  in  adults  and 
children, no new safety concerns are raised at this moment. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to update 
the Instruction for Use in the Package Leaflet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 125/132 
 
 
 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- No extensive changes have been made to the Package Leaflet to incorporate the paediatric 
indication, and no new descriptions related to contra-indications, warnings and precautions or 
undesirable effects have been added. 
- Few precautions have been added to mitigate potential choking-risk for children (e.g., 
“immediately throw away the cotton ball or the gauze after use”). These are considered minor 
changes. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in paediatric patients 
from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating 
agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the previous ESA. 
Anaemia is a common comorbidity in patients with CKD, including children. This condition is associated 
with  multiple  adverse  clinical  consequences  and  its  management  is  a  core  component  of  nephrology 
care. Although numerous complex factors interact in the development of this anaemia, erythropoietin 
deficiency  and  iron  dysregulation  (including  iron  deficiency  and  iron-restricted  erythropoiesis)  are  the 
primary causes. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently available treatment options for the management of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD 
include  short-acting  human  recombinant  erythropoietins  and  longer-acting  erythropoiesis  stimulating 
agents (ESAs). In Europe, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta and darbepoetin alfa are approved for 
the  treatment  of  anaemia  due  to  CKD  in  paediatric  patients.  Epoetin  alfa  and  zeta  are  approved  for 
patients  aged  1  to  18  years  on  haemodialysis  (HD),  and  epoetin  beta  is  approved  for  treating 
symptomatic  anaemia  caused  by  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  yet  on  dialysis. 
Darbepoetin was approved by EMA for paediatric patients on and not yet on dialysis in 2015. Darbepoetin 
and epoetin beta are approved for IV as well as SC use in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and epoetin 
zeta are approved for paediatric patients on HD, and dosing recommendations are given for IV use only. 
Mircera  (methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-epoetin  beta)  is  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  currently 
approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients. Mircera was 
first approved in Europe on 20 July 2007.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
In this submission the MAH is seeking an extension of indication to include treatment of symptomatic 
anaemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age on ESA 
Assessment report

maintenance  treatment.  It  is  a  switch  indication  from  IV  ESA  to  IV  Mircera  and  from  SC  ESA  to  SC 
Mircera. 
Efficacy  is  based  on  an  extrapolation  exercise,  two  dose  finding  studies  in  children  with  anaemia 
associated to CKD and a PopPK model. Overall, extrapolation is acceptable considering the availability 
of PK data in children compared to adults, the data in adults from adequate and controlled trials and that 
the physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children. 
Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence 
on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population  (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on 
haemodialysis,  following  iv  administration  of  Mircera  after  switching  from  other  ESAs  (i.e.,  epoetin 
alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks 
of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration and continued 4 weeks 
more during the evaluation period. 
Study  NH19708  was  a  phase  II,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter  study  designed  to  ascertain  the 
starting  dose  of  Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  3  months-17  years  paediatric  patients  with  CKD 
anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dyalisis when switching with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or dabepoetin 
alfa. The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration 
(16 weeks), and evaluation (4 weeks). 
In both studies, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels and eligible patients were 
offered to enter a safety extension period. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study NH19707, the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was -0.09 
g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) in group 2. During the evaluation period, 75% of patients maintained Hb 
values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 81% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The 
proportion of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69%. During the core 
phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL. 
In study NH19708, the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation 
period (weeks 17-21) was the primary efficacy endpoint. The mean change (±SD) in Hb concentration 
level  during  the  evaluation  period  for  study  NH19708  showed  a  0.48 (1.03) g/dL  increase  above  the 
baseline level. The 90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within the 
protocol specified range of ±1.1 g/dL and the SD was <1.5 g/dL.  
During the evaluation period, 50% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the 
baseline levels, and 63.2% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportions of patients with Hb values 
within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 47.4%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In study NH19708 the Mircera mean dose was reduced approximately by 30% over the evaluation period, 
62.5%  of  patients  had  dose  decreases  only  and  a  considerable  number  of  patients  had  an  Hb  value 
above the target range (30%). As mentioned in the Pharmacology Section, a 2.18-fold increase in SC 
bioavailability was estimated in paediatric patients compared to adult patients. In addition, the provided 
pcVPC  for  adult  data  following  SC  administration  shows  that  the  model  excessively  underpredicts  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 127/132 
 
 
 
median  of  the  data,  which  indicates  that  the  estimated  bioavailability  of  31%  may  be biased  and  the 
true SC bioavailability for adults is higher than this estimate. Safety concerns were raised following the 
SC switch, and the popPK model was updated.  
Uncertainties of differences in paediatric SC bioavailability between other ESAs has been described, and 
these differences may have an impact on the apparently too high initial Mircera SC dose. Also, when the 
paediatric conversion doses are compared to the adult conversion doses, the paediatric conversion doses 
are considerably higher. For example, a 16-year-old subject on 60 µg darbepoetin would be switched to 
360 µg Mircera whereas an 18-year-old with the same dose darbepoetin would be switched to 200 µg 
Mircera. Unfortunately, data provided by the MAH to address this question does not allow to conclude 
on the adequacy of the “high conversion factor”. Considering that for practical and safety reasons the 
same  conversion  factor  for  IV  to  IV  and  SC  to  SC  switch  is  the  preferred  option,  and  the  already 
mentioned theorical safety concerns following SC to SC switch when the high CF is used, the intermediate 
CF is recommended to initiate the treatment with a lower dose, in order to avoid unnecessary high Hb 
levels, even when there is no clinical data supporting the use of that factor. This is taking on board that 
frequent  monitoring  is  required  for  these  patients,  and  patients  can  be  uptitrated  until  reaching  the 
appropriate  Hb  target.  This  would  also  avoid  the  discrepancies  between  paediatric  dosing  and  adult 
dosing. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety results from these phase II studies showed that 77% and 73% of patients in the core period and 
safety extension period reported at least one adverse event in study NH19707, and 80% and 64% of 
patients in the core period and safety extension period in study NH19708 respectively.  
The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  >  15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and 
infestations,  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, administration 
site conditions and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]). 
During the core period of study NH19707, 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse event, 
7 of which showed hypertension prior to inclusion in the study. The other one had previously received 
antihypertensive therapy. Two of these reported cases (3.1%) were classified as serious adverse events, 
and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period of study NH19707, 
five  patients  (13.5%)  reported  hypertension,  however  two  (5.4%)  was  classified  as  serious  and  not 
related to the study medication. Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis in study NH19707 (2 
patients  (3.1%)  described  as  thrombosis  in  device  and  2  patients  (3.1%)  as  arteriovenous  fistula 
thrombosis).  All  cases  were  classified  as  serious  adverse  events.  However  only  two  of  them  were 
considered related to the study medication (one case each). During the safety extension period of study 
NH19707  arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  and  thrombosis  in  device  were  reported  in  2  patients  each 
(5.4%). Two of them were classified as serious adverse event (one arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and 
the  other  one  thrombosis  in  device)  and  none  of  them  was  considered  related  to  the  study  drug.  No 
thromboembolic events (i.e. pulmonary embolism) have been recorded in study NH19707. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 128/132 
 
 
 
During the core period of study NH19708, 2 patients (5%) reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of 
hypertension,  that  were  considered  unrelated  Mircera  and  resolved  with  treatment.  No  patients 
experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period. One patient (2,5%) reported a 
total of 9 AEs of vascular access thrombosis in study NH19708; all of them were considered unrelated 
to treatment, and ¡one was a serious grade 2 AE.  
In both studies platelet count decreased along core and safety extension study period. This had been 
previously observed in adult treated patients. No bleeding events were reported in any patient who had 
post-baseline platelet counts below normal range.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety data set is very limited. This is an uncommon disease in children who are usually less 
symptomatic  and  in  less  need  of  treatment  with  ESA.  The  difficulties  to  obtain  a  broader  data  set  is 
acknowledged but this translates into a limited characterisation of the safety profile. Also, limited data 
from  patients  <1  year  is available.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  patients  with  symptomatic  anaemia 
associated with CKD, the physiologically normal low kidney function is not regarded as an issue, as ESA 
response is not influenced by the function or immaturity of the kidneys, rather than the severity of kidney 
impairment.  Nevertheless,  taking  into  consideration  the  long  half-life  of  Mircera  and  that  children  <1 
year with renal failure or severe renal dysfunction is a frail population with high morbidity, it is considered 
prudent to carefully evaluate before switching from a well-functioning dosing of another product. This 
has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In addition, considering the shift to Mircera is occurring 
in patients in stable maintenance, monthly Hb monitoring and dose adjustments are recommended in 
the SmPC to allow to adapt doses to each patient.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  MAH  has  justified  that  the  data  available  support  the  switch  to  Mircera  of  patients  with  anaemia 
associated  with  CKD  who  are  clinically  stable  with  epoetins  or  darbepoetin  treatment,  however  data 
provided by the MAH to support the high conversion factor does not allow to conclude on its adequacy. 
It has been argued, that the high conversion factor with SC to SC switch administration results in Hb

values  above  the  recommended  level  of  12  g/dL,  especially  in  the  youngest  children  (5/11  subjects). 
From this perspective, it has been considered more prudent to initiate treatment with a lower dose to 
avoid unnecessary high Hb levels and its potential associated safety issues. This also avoids discrepancies 
between paediatric dosing and adult dosing.  
According to the data submitted it seems that no new safety adverse events have been described for 
Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population,  although  the  safety  database  is  considered  limited,  especially  in 
children below 1 year old. 
The risk of vacuolation due to PEG accumulation in choroid plexus and other tissues and the risk for the 
paediatric population has been previously described for other PEGylated products. Following the CHMP 
request,  the  MAH  has  included  a  discussion  of  the  potential  concerns  for  use  of  Mircera,  which  is  a 
PEGylated medicinal product in paediatric patients. Results provided support that Mircera is not expected 
to cause any safety concern as consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation to the 
CNS and other tissues (see non-clinical assessment). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk balance of Mircera for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are 
converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was 
stabilised with the previous ESA, is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mircera is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years 
of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin 
level was stabilised with the previous ESA. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 
6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to update the Instruction for Use in 
the Package Leaflet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/321300/2023  
Page 131/132 
 
 
 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB are 
recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0317/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above.

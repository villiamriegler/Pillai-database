incidence rate ratio of 0.11; adjusted for in-/outpatient 
setting, age, sex, Privigen dose and indication for Privigen 
use; one-sided p-value <0.01) after implementation of the 
IAC step compared to baseline. Additionally, 28 paediatric 
patients with CIDP <18 years of age were identified 
throughout the entire study period from 1 January 2008 to 
30 April 2019. No paediatric patients with CIDP given a 
total of 486 Privigen administrations experienced 
haemolytic anaemia, AMS, acute renal failure, severe 
anaphylactic reaction or a thromboembolic event. Two 
patients experienced a moderate anaphylactic reaction, 
equating to 0.4% of all Privigen administrations. The 
special warnings and precautions for use in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC are also updated to state that the Privigen 
manufacturing process includes an immunoaffinity 
chromatography (IAC) step that specifically reduces blood 
group A and B antibodies (isoagglutinins A and B). Clinical 
data with Privigen manufactured with the IAC step show 
statistically significant reductions of haemolytic anaemia 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated to list the Study

IgPro10_3004 in Japanese patients with PID and CIPD 
within the studies on safety and efficacy of Privigen. Safety 
data from this study were incorporated into the adverse 
drug reaction database resulting in an updated frequency 
categorization for ‘nausea’ (changed from very common to 
common). In addition, the term ‘infusion site discomfort’ 
was added as an ADR and grouped with ‘injection site pain 
with a frequency uncommon in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The RMP is updated to remove the Category 3 Study 
IgPro_5003 from the ongoing studies.  
The additional risk minimization measures for hemolysis 
are updated with the permanent implementation of an 
immunoaffinity chromatography step in the manufacturing 
process of Privigen and the discontinuation of screening of 
plasma donors. The summary of safety concerns is updated 
to remove ‘safety information pertaining to the paediatric 
population with CIPD’ following the completion of the PASS 
(IgPro10_5003) study.

patients in the PATH study was comparable to those seen in 
the PRIMA study which was pivotal for the approval of the 
CIDP indication. 
In terms of safety, no new safety concerns have arisen. 
With regard to efficacy, the data can be viewed as 
supplementary to the PRIMA study and to the general 
knowledge of the beneficial effects of IVIGs in treating 
CIDP. 
For more information on safety and efficacy information 
from the PATH study, please refer to sections 4.8

The product information was updated to include the

consequential update of the safety information 
particularly to amend the existing information on 
haemolysis and to include Transfusion-related acute 
lung injury (TRALI). The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to amend Annex 
II of the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
II and PL 
following information on a recently completed study: 
“In the second ITP study, 57 patients with ITP (baseline 
platelet counts ≤ 30×109 / l) aged between 18 and 65 
years were treated with Privigen at 1 g/kg bw. On day 3 
patients could receive a second dose of 1 g/ kg bw, for 
patients with a platelet count of < 50×109 / l on day 3 this 
second dose was mandatory. Overall, in 42 subjects (74 %) 
the platelet count increased at least once to ≥ 50×109 / l 
within 6 days after the first infusion, which was well within

the expected range. A second dose in subjects with platelet 
counts ≥ 50×109 /l after the first dose provided a relevant 
additional benefit in terms of higher and longer-lasting 
increases in platelet counts compared to a single dose. In 
subjects with platelet counts < 50×109 / l after the first 
dose, 30% showed a platelet response of ≥ 50×109 / l 
after the mandatory second dose.” 
In addition, the safety information was updated with 
regards to: 
- Haemolysis: If signs and/or symptoms of haemolysis 
develop during or after an IVIg infusion, discontinuation of 
the IVIg treatment should be considered by the treating 
physician. 
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): 
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may very rarely occur 
following treatment with IVIg products, including Privigen. 
TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, 
pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular 
function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 
6 hours following treatment. Monitor patients for 
pulmonary adverse reactions. TRALI may be managed 
using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Privigen remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons:  
Haemolysis is a well known risk of IVIgs (included in the 
core SmPC). As a higher rate of mild and severe haemolytic 
reactions has been reported with Privigen (a number of risk 
factors have been identified: higher doses (off-label use), 
non O blood type, inflammatory conditions, kidney damage 
Page 28/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and nephrotoxic concomitant medication), the CHMP 
concluded that this risk needs to be further investigate. As 
detailed in the Risk Management Plan, the MAH will be 
searching for additional possible causative factors of 
haemolysis in the ongoing post-authorisation study 
IgPro10_4001. The MAH will also change its donor pool and 
the manufacturing process in order to reduce the 
isoagglutinine titers in the final product and conduct a non-
interventional post-authorisation study to compare the rate 
of haemolysis before and after implementation of these two 
measures. 
Therefore, on the justified grounds relating to 
Pharmacovigilance that the risk of haemolysis associated 
with Privigen should be further characterised, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit an additional five-
year renewal.

expanded with information on the following risk factors: 
blood groups and high doses and with regard to the 
and PL 
high doses, non-0 blood group (both based on analysis of 
rare complications of haemolysis-related renal failure 
and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In 
addition, the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and the PL 
are updated according to the latest versions of QRD 
template, Guideline on SmPC and Core SmPC for 
Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous 
Administration. Also editorial changes have been 
introduced in the Product Information and the list of 
the received case reports with haemolytic reactions in 
association with Privigen) and underlying inflammatory 
state (based on scientific literature). Furthermore, of 104 
patients reported to have ‘Haemolytic disorders’ there were 
4 reports of secondary acute renal failure and 2 reports of 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. A corresponding 
warning has also been included in the SmPC.

The MAH has proposed changes to section 4.4 and 4.8 of 
information on the risk of haemolysis / haemolytic 
anaemia. Additionally, SmPC sections 5.1 and 5.2 
were updated with data that was already assessed in 
Variation II/13. Furthermore, editorial changes have 
been introduced in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC.

the SmPC with regard to the risk of haemolysis / 
haemolytic anaemia. As plasma pools from >1000 donors 
will contain antibodies to A, B (and thus to AB) antigens on 
the red blood cells it is logical that patients with these 
blood groups may be affected by haemolytic reactions. In 
published scientific literature, haemolytic reactions were 
associated with a non-O blood group and frequently with 
high doses of IVIg (> 2 g/kg). Such warning describes a 
possible class effect/adverse reaction of IVIg products in 
general. This update of the safety information, editorial 
changes of the SmPC as well as update appropriate 
wording in sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are acceptable 
and do not affect the overall positive benefit-risk balance of 
this product.

from clinical study ZLB05_006CR. The data provided by this 
clinical 
trial updated the efficacy and safety profile of IgPro10. This 
study utilised a very similar study design as the pivotal 
Primary 
Immunodeficiency disease (PID) study ZLB03_002CR. The 
new study tested a higher increased infusion rate of up to 
12 mg/kg/min 
for patients that previously participated in the pivotal 
clinical study. 
The infusion rate of Privigen may therefore be increased up 
to (but not more than) 7.2 mL/kg of body weight (bw) per 
hour in patients 
who tolerate well the drug. 
The list of Adverse Drug Reactions of Privigen was updated 
with the safety results of this clinical study.

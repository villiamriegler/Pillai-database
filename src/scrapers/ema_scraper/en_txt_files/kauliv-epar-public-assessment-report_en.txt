2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Dosage form and strength: 
cartridge containing 3 mL of teriparatide solution 
for injection [250µg/mL]  
Kauliv 
Procedure: 
Biosimilar application 
Therapeutic class or indication: 
ATC code: H05AA02 
Proposed dosage range: 
20µg/80µL dose 
Kauliv was developed as biosimilar product to the European reference product Forsteo (Eli Lilly) 
solution for injection in pre-filled pen, containing 20µg / 80µL of recombinantly produced teriparatide. 
It is proposed for the same indications and dosages as approved for the reference product. The 
marketing authorisation for the reference product Forsteo was granted to Eli Lilly by the European 
Union in June 2003 (via the Centralised Procedure, marketing authorisation number EU/1/03/247/001-
002). As part of the global product development approach, the finished product was also developed to 
be equivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD) Forteo 20 micrograms / 80 mL solution for injection in 
pre-filled pen, marketed in the United States by Lilly USA. 
Kauliv is provided in a cartridge containing 3 mL of drug product solution. It is intended for use with 
the re-usable Kauliv pen. The pen is manufactured by Owen Mumford.  
Pack sizes are 1 cartridge / pack and 3 cartridges / pack. 
Therapeutic indications, posology, and route of administration proposed for Kauliv are identical to 
those for Forsteo. Forsteo is currently authorised for the following therapeutic indications within the 
EU:  
•  Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. In 
postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated.  
•  Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women 
and men at increased risk for fracture. 
Forsteo is available as a pre-filled pen of 2.4 mL, containing 600 micrograms of teriparatide 
corresponding to 250 micrograms per mL; each dose of 80 microlitres contains 20 micrograms of 
teriparatide. The recommended dose of Forsteo is 20 micrograms administered once daily, the 
maximum total duration of treatment should be 24 months, and the 24-month course should not be 
repeated over a patient’s lifetime. Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D 
supplements if dietary intake is inadequate. 
Kauliv is a sterile, colourless, clear, isotonic solution formulated in a multi-dose cartridge presentation 
(28 doses) and is loaded into a reusable pen device for delivering the intended dose of 80 uL. The 
biologically active ingredient of Kauliv is teriparatide which is a key regulator of the concentrations of 
calcium, phosphate, and active vitamin D metabolites in blood and modulates cellular activity in bone 
resulting in bone remodelling and maintenance of the bone structure. Teriparatide is the biologically 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 11/57 
 
 
 
 
active 34-amino acid N-terminal fragment and analogue of the 84-amino acid native parathyroid 
hormone PTH (1-84). It belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of calcium homeostasis, 
parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC-code H05AA02. 
Physiological actions of parathyroid hormone include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular 
reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH 
and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors known as 
the PTH-1 receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors 
with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Kauliv is presented as solution for injection containing 250 micrograms/ml of 
teriparatide as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol, glacial acetic acid, anhydrous sodium acetate, metacresol, diluted 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections. 
The product is available in a 3 ml cartridge (intended for 28 doses) to be used with a re-usable pen. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (INN: teriparatide) is a recombinant is a linear polypeptide molecule expressed in 
E. coli. It is a truncated analogue of native human parathyroid hormone, PTH (1-84), consisting of the 
biologically active 34-amino acid N-terminal fragment (rhPTH [1-34]) of human PTH (1-84). rhPTH (1-
34) has a molecular weight (MW) of 4118 Daltons (Da). It crystallises as a slightly bent, long helical 
dimer. It does not contain any disulphide bridges, glycosylation or other post-translational 
modifications. Information on the physiochemical properties of rhPTH (1-34) have been provided. 
Teriparatide has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product, the EU-approved Forsteo and 
the US-approved Forteo (Eli Lilly). 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Teriparatide active substance (AS) is manufactured and released at Stelis Biopharma Pvt Ltd, Plot 
no.293, Bommasandra Jigani link Road, Bengaluru, India (referred to as Unit-I). The Master cell bank 
(MCB) and Working cell bank (WCB) sites were stated. A Major Objection (MO) has been raised 
concerning the EU GMP compliance of the sites involved in AS manufacture including future WCB 
manufacture, raw material and in-process testing. The sites have been inspected by EU authorities and 
their GMP compliance was confirmed. In the response to the MO, EU GMP certificates of compliance for 
Stelis Biopharma manufacturing sites, where the activities of active substance manufacturing including 
future WCB manufacture, raw material and in-process testing take place was also submitted. The QP 
declaration has been appropriately updated to cover the claimed manufacturing activities.

Teriparatide is recombinantly expressed as PTH fusion protein by E. coli cells with a tag having an 
enzyme cleavage site. The tag is used to ease purification of fusion protein during purification. The 
fusion protein is a soluble protein thereby avoiding any refolding step. 
The teriparatide AS upstream manufacturing process is a conventional fed batch process starting with 
the inoculum build-up, comprising two stages of culture expansion from shake flask (seed 1) followed 
by  fermentation (seed II) and IPTG-induced production of PTH fusion protein in a fed batch 
production. 
After cell harvest the downstream process starts with cell lysis, followed by centrifugation and hollow 
fibre filtration. The filtrate containing the teriparatide fusion protein is subjected to purification by a 
series of chromatography steps. Teriparatide AS is buffer-exchanged and stored in PETG bottles at -
20°C.  
Process parameter (PPs) for each step including their classification as critical (CPP), key (KPP) and 
non-critical (non-CPP) were provided in separate tables. The description of the manufacturing process 
contains the essential information including classification of CPPs/KPPs/non-CPPs and presented in 
relevant dossier sections. Harvest criteria for cell culture purity and cell age have been defined. In-
process controls (IPCs) and tests are included in the downstream process description. However the 
preliminary IPC acceptance criteria for cell lysis efficiency should be revised once data is generated 
from 20 (or other suitable number) commercial scale batches (REC). Bioburden control during the 
downstream process is performed and respective IPCs have been established. Neither re-processing 
nor re-filtration is foreseen in the manufacture of teriparatide. 
Control of materials 
The generation of the cell substrate is well described. The cloning strategy of the expression plasmid 
has been adequately described. The DNA and protein sequence as well as a schematic of the final 
expression plasmid are included in the dossier. The Applicant provided the requested information on 
alignment of amino acid sequence of the PTH fusion protein with the nucleotide sequence of cloned 
cDNAs encoding human PTH, available published patents, the sequence of native PTH and the product 
sequence of the innovator company.  
A two-tiered banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB) 
has been established A dual storage system for the MCB and WCB is also in place The generation of 
MCB/WCB is described.  
The characterisation testing program of MCB and WCB is considered adequate to identify relevant 
phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. As regards stability of MCB and WCB under the proposed 
storage conditions, the Applicant provided the requested stability protocol for MCB and WCB testing. 
The retest period and test parameters are deemed adequate. 
End of production cell banks have been prepared from process validation batches executed at the 
intended commercial scale. As requested, information on viability was provided. Cell identity has been 
confirmed by 16sRNA analysis.  
The raw materials used for cell culture and purification are listed in the dossier. Where applicable, 
reference is made to compendial monographs. No raw materials derived from human and/or animal 
sources are used in the process. As requested, the applicant has provided information on resin 
materials and filters, and revised the dossier accordingly. Respective CoAs have been submitted. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical steps during the upstream and downstream manufacturing of teriparatide AS have been 
identified and in-process controls (IPCs) have been presented. Attributes monitored for controlling the 
critical steps during upstream and downstream processing were listed together with their acceptance

criteria and are found to be in agreement with information provided in section 3.2.S.2.2. CPPs along 
with respective control ranges for each manufacturing step have been included in section 3.2.S.2.4 . 
Acceptable definitions of critical quality attributes (CQAs) of teriparatide AS have been provided.  
No process intermediates are reported in sections 3.2.S.2.2 and 3.2.S.2.4. However, hold times have 
been defined for cases of urgent need and maximum holding times between different manufacturing 
steps have been provided. Results of hold time studies sufficiently support the proposed holding times 
and conditions. 
Process validation and/or verification 
Process validation follows a traditional 3 batches/NOR approach based on process characterisation. 
Three consecutive teriparatide AS batches manufactured at the intended commercial scale have been 
included in the process validation campaign and subsequently released according to Ph. Eur. 
specifications meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all parameters.  
According to the applicant, the process parameters (CPP/KPP/NPP) and critical quality attributes (CQA) 
at each stage have been monitored as per the process validation protocol and process control strategy. 
All evaluated critical and key process parameters and performance attributes for the 
upstream/downstream process were found to be within the normal operating and expected ranges. 
Selected non-critical process parameters were also verified to be within the specified ranges. Each lot 
met in-process limits, demonstrating consistent operations. All relevant CPPs and CQAs related to 
teriparatide AS and its manufacture have been verified in the process validation campaign. Based on 
that, suitability and robustness of the teriparatide AS manufacturing process is considered to be 
confirmed.  
Column resin and membrane life-times have also been demonstrated. In general, the studies 
confirmed that resins and filters perform consistently over the defined life spans. An acceptable, full-
scale verification protocol for column/membrane lifetime has been provided.  
Intermediate holding times and storage conditions have been validated based on evaluation of protein 
concentration and purity using scale-down models. 
Shipping qualification studies demonstrated suitability of the selected shipping configuration. 
Manufacturing process development 
Various manufacturing site transfers have been taken place from early manufacturing process 
development towards the proposed commercial AS process and the proposed commercial site starting 
with the establishment of process consistency at Stelis. Subsequently, the manufacturing process was 
transferred to the GMP facility for manufacture of GMP batches for non-clinical and pilot PK study 
followed by transfer to the GMP manufacturing facility for scalability and additional process 
optimisation. The final manufacturing process was subsequently transferred including downscaling to 
the proposed commercial site at Stelis Unit-I. Of note, site transfer to the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site at Stelis Unit-I has been completed prior to initiation of pivotal clinical trial and 
process validation. 
According to the applicant, operational parameters have been optimised throughout development. The 
manufacturing processes used to produce the AS materials that have been employed in pre-clinical and 
clinical studies have been clearly described. It has been clarified at which stage specific parameters 
have been optimised.  
The manufacturing processes used for the production of pre-clinical and clinical materials have been 
directly compared with the proposed commercial process and differences have been outlined following 
a MO raised in this regard. Process changes have been identified and evaluated by the applicant taking 
into consideration ICH Q5E requirements. Summarising, the provided data are considered acceptable

to demonstrate comparability between the AS manufacturing processes used for production of pre-
clinical material and clinical/commercial material and thus the MO has been resolved.  
According to the applicant, a structured approach for performing and elaborate process 
characterisation studies for upstream and downstream manufacturing process has been followed. A 
thorough risk analysis of the manufacturing process, which involved the identification and evaluation of 
all risks based on historical data, development reports, batch summaries, manufacturing records, 
relevant technical reports and literature reviews has been conducted. Risk assessment (report 
provided), Ishikawa analysis, Cause and Effects (C&E) analysis and a failure mode and effects (FMEA) 
analysis were used to identify potential failure modes and to link these to the manufacturing steps and 
parameters as well as to classify CPPs the respective reports are available. Based on the outcome of 
risk assessment, process parameters have been classified in accordance with ICH. 
A brief summary of process characterisation studies for each unit operation including study type and 
ranges for each tested parameter, CQA impacted, classification as CPP or non-CPP, along with 
corresponding NORs and PAR is included in the dossier. Linkage of CPPs to CQAs has been sufficiently 
described, CQAs have been explicitly defined and named along with a rationale for designating these 
as CQAs. CQAs are generally determined by a risk assessment of product quality attributes and their 
impact on safety and efficacy using information from clinical, non-clinical, and toxicological studies as 
well as prior knowledge. A list of all CQAs defined for teriparatide AS has been included in the dossier.  
Overall, the applicant’s strategy to control the process is considered acceptable. A risk assessment for 
identification of material attributes and process parameters with the potential for having an effect on 
CQAs as required by ICH Q11 has been provided. Critical process parameters and CQAs applied for the 
commercial process were identified during process development. Respective supportive information/ 
reports have been provided. 
Characterisation 
Recombinant teriparatide consists of 34 amino acids without disulfide bonds. Due to its expression in E. 
coli cells glycosylation or posttranslational modifications are not part of its structure. Noteworthy that 
the peptide is expressed as a fusion protein >18 kDa.  
The initially presented information regarding the AS characterisation was not satisfactory since it was 
mainly based on batch comparability. Also, there were some contradicting results in other parts of the 
dossier and literature data. Therefore a MO was raised requesting comprehensive additional 
information on the characterisation of teriparatide.  
In the response state-of-the-art analytical standard techniques have been applied for characterisation 
of relevant physicochemical and biological quality characteristics of teriparatide. The characterisation 
studies have been performed using batches manufactured with the proposed commercial 
manufacturing process also representative for clinical trial material. The primary structure amino acid 
sequence analysis, and secondary and higher structure was studied by employing state of the art 
analytical techniques and presented in the dossier. The biologic function of teriparatide was confirmed 
by a cell based (UMR-106) bioassay (in-house, USP).  
Impurities 
Product related substances have been addressed. Approximately ten individual substances were 
detected, which were mainly composed of oxidised, deamidated or succinimide intermediates. Forced 
degradation studies were submitted which did not reveal any impurities other than those already 
known. 
Process related substances have been monitored at the level of each unit operation to demonstrate 
clearance, data provided on the removal of process related impurities are considered sufficient.  
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
A MO was raised during the procedure concerning the removal and clearance of process-related 
impurities. For most of the impurities appropriate clearance could be demonstrated and there is no 
necessity to include parameter and acceptance criteria into the AS/FP specification. For the specific Tag 
impurity, the discrepancy between the reported maximum level Tag impurity in AS batches and the 
calculated Tag impurity in the finished product has now also been clarified. Furthermore, to determine 
Tag impurity in the AS more sensitively than with current LC-MS method, a new ELISA test has been 
developed. The new test method is sufficiently described and appropriately validated and the AS 
specification has been accordingly updated with an acceptance criterion. Justification for the proposed 
limit was based on method performance data and on batch data from clinical and process validation 
batches. Studies on the removal of process related impurities confirmed the clearance of process-
related impurities. Summarising the provided data, Tag impurity has been demonstrated to be 
constantly below quantitation limit in both clinical and process validation batches manufactured with 
the commercial scale. The MO on process related impurities and specifically the introduction of an 
adequate test parameter and acceptance criterion for process-related Tag impurity is considered 
resolved.  
Container closure system 
Teriparatide bulk AS is stored in sterile Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) bottles with High 
Density Polyethylene (HDPE) screw caps. The PETG bottles and the HDPE closure comply with EP 
3.2.2.1. The risk of leachables from the container closure system has been investigated and is 
negligible.  
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The AS release and shelf life specifications has been presented in the relevant dossier sections that 
include tests for physical characteristics (physical appearance, pH),  identity (peptide mapping, RP-
HPLC), purity (assay related substances, purity, process related impurities),  potency (bioassay) and 
safety related tests (bioburden, bacterial endotoxins). 
The proposed specification for release of the AS is covering the relevant quality attributes of 
teriparatide. The provided specification contains identity and content by RP-HPLC, purity by RP-HPLC 
and SE-HPLC, identity by peptide mapping, potency (and bio-identity) by in-vitro bioassay, endotoxins, 
bioburden, HCP, hcDNA and acetronitrile content. The justification for the specification has been based 
largely on the teriparatide monographs of Ph. Eur. and/or USP and have been father tightened during 
the procedure based on clinical/PV batch data (including clinical, process validation and additional 
batches taken for addressing EMA queries). The shelf life specifications acceptance criteria for process-
related impurities remained slightly higher than the release specification but comply with monograph 
limits which is considered acceptable. Control of Tag impurity is implemented into the active substance 
specification with an acceptable limt. 
Analytical procedure 
The information on the analytical methods used was insufficient initially and a MO was raised 
requesting sufficiently detailed narrative descriptions for each analytical method and structured 
inclusion in the dossier in view of product lifecycle management of potential. Likewise, consistent 
information on validation of analytical procedures was requested. Following the response to the MO, all 
analytical methods have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Adequate validation data was provided in summary tables. 
Method verification was provided for compendial test methods. MO was consequently resolved. The in-
vitro potency is determined based on the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the rat 
osteosarcoma cell line. Activation of the PTH receptor initiates a cascade event which triggers an 
Assessment report

intracellular rise in cAMP concentration. This increase was determined and compared with the USP RS 
using commercially available cAMP ELISA kit. 
Reference standards of materials 
The applicant has established an internal reference standard (IRS). The identification name, date of 
manufacture and the analytical test methods for which the RS is intended to be used, as well as the AS 
batches used for the RS production were provided. A protocol for preparing reference materials was 
provided.  
Batch analyses 
Batch analysis data have been provided including the data generated from the process validation 
batches. The process validation batches were manufactured at the intended commercial scale in Stelis 
Unit-1. All batches met the specification at the time of measurement. All process verification lots met 
the proposed commercial specification.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data have been provided comprising data for 24 months long-term (-20 ± 5°C) storage and 
six month accelerated storage (5± 3°C) with three primary stability batches manufactured at 
commercial scale. Stability at both long-term and accelerated temperature conditions are in 
accordance with ICH requirements.  
Supportive stability data were presented for process validation batches for 24 months at -20°C and 6 
months at 5°C.  
Samples were tested for Physical appearance, identity, assay, purity, potency, bacterial endotoxin and 
bioburden. OOS was observed at an intermediate timepoint and was attributed to the method 
execution. However, no confirmed OOS results were reported during the analysis of subsequent time 
points. All parameters were within the specification limits. The results for related impurities indicate 
that the method is suitable and accurate for estimating related impurities. In addition, the method has 
been revalidated to demonstrate the suitability of the method for commercial batch release.  
Data of forced degradation studies of teriparatide including acidic pH, alkali pH, oxidative stress and 
thermal degradation were presented. The parameters protein content, related compounds, HMWs and 
impurity identification were considered as critical quality attributes. The study on the forced 
degradation of the active substance teriparatide resulted in the expected degradation products (various 
deamidation, oxidation and succinimide intermediates). The data provided confirm the statement that 
the forced degradation studies resulted mainly in the already known deamidated and oxidized 
impurities as well as succinimide intermediates. Photostability study was performed on the finished 
product. This is considered acceptable  
Overall, the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Kauliv finished product (FP) is a sterile, colourless, clear, isotonic solution for injection presented in a 
cartridge as a multi-dose presentation (28 doses) containing 250 µg teriparatide (r-DNA origin) as 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 17/57 
 
 
 
 
active ingredient per mL of solution. Each cartridge contains 3.0 ml of solution. The cartridge is to be 
loaded onto a reusable pen device to deliver a total of 28 doses (each dose containing 20 μg per 80 
microliter) of teriparatide.  
The FP solution is filled in a glass cartridge that is closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a 
combiseal with bromobutyl bilayer on the product-contacting side. 
The cartridge is intended for use with the re-usable pen device developed for Kauliv. The user is 
required to install a 3 ml cartridge of teriparatide into the cartridge holder, reassemble the cartridge 
holder and pen body, and attach a sterile needle prior to each injection. The priming dose (P) and a 
single dose of drug (D) is dialled using the dose knob, at the non-needle end of the device. The dose is 
then delivered by pressing a release button on the side of the device. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Kauliv was developed as biosimilar to Forsteo. The qualitative composition of proposed biosimilar 
product is the same as that of the reference medicinal product Forsteo except for minor differences in 
the quantity of two components: sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid. All excipients used are 
specified according to Ph. Eur. 
The influence of manufacturing process setup, like order of excipient addition, nitrogen sparging, etc. 
and parameters like pH, temperature, mixing duration on the teriparatide bulk drug product solution 
was investigated. Based on these results, the manufacturing process was designed. Compatibility 
studies with the product solution and the sterile filters were performed and support suitability of the 
selected materials.  
Several site transfers occurred during manufacturing process development, up to the final upscale and 
transfer to the site where the commercial process is intended to take place. The outcome of the 
comparability exercise indicated that the process and the finished products manufactured at the site 
used to manufacture material for the pivotal clinical studies and the site to be used for commercial FP 
manufacture were highly comparable. 
Container closure system 
The FP primary packaging system consists of a 3 mL siliconised glass cartridge, closed with a 
bromobutyl plunger stopper and a combi-seal with bilayer (cream bromo butyl + polyisoprene). The 
information on the primary packaging components is deemed sufficient. 
Extractables/ leachables studies have been performed with the rubber stopper, the combi-seal, and the 
pre-siliconised glass cartridge. Few substances were identified in the extractable studies above the 
AET, amongst others inorganic ions. These potential leachables were further investigated in FP samples 
that had undergone 3 months storage under accelerated conditions. None of the substances identified 
as potential leachable could be confirmed in the FP samples. The suitability of the container closure 
system in terms of compatibility is considered satisfactorily demonstrated. 
Compatibility with the pen device was demonstrated in terms of pen functionality with Kauliv 
cartridges. Overall, the information provided on compatibility of the pen device with the FP in 
cartridges is considered satisfactorily shown. 
Kauliv is a sterile injection containing metacresol to ensure sterility over the in-use period of 28 days. 
Preservative efficacy was tested, using in-use stability study samples. Container closure integrity was 
investigated and found to be confirmed.

2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP manufacture is performed at Stelis Biopharma Pvt Ltd. (Unit-II), Plot no.: 2-D1, Obadenahalli, 
Doddaballapura, 3rd Phase, Industrial area, Doddaballapura Taluk, Bengaluru Rural District –561 203, 
India. 
Batch release takes place at Fairmed Healthcare GmbH, Maria-Goeppert-Strabe-3, 23562 Luebeck, 
Germany. 
A MO has been raised concerning the EU GMP compliance of the site involved in finished product 
manufacture. The site has been inspected by EU authorities and its GMP compliance was confirmed. In 
the response to the MO, EU GMP certificate of compliance was provided. 
The manufacturing process of the FP includes of the following steps: preparation of buffers and 
solutions, addition of AS, compounding of the formulated bulk, and filling into cartridges. 
While the FP manufacturing process is a straightforward fill-finish process, it is considered to be a non-
standard manufacturing process. The manufacturing process description is acceptable. Batch size was 
clearly stated. Process parameters and in-process tests are stated with their classification as critical or 
non-critical and acceptable ranges.  
Sterilisation of the primary packaging is part of the FP manufacturing and its description is included 
with a satisfactory level of detail in the relevant chapters of section P.3.3. Satisfactory information on 
the validation of the sterilisation cycles for glass vials and plunger stoppers is included in P.3.5. 
The information provided in filter validation studies supports the use of the sterilization filters.  
Four commercial scale batches have been manufactured for process validation, executed at the 
intended commercial site. Overall, the four runs were executed successfully, resulting in FP batches 
compliant with the FP specification. Media fill runs reflecting the conditions of the finished product 
manufacturing process were successfully performed. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form for physical characteristics (physical appearance, pH, osmolality extractable volume), 
identity (RP-HPLC), purity (assay related substances, purity, meta-cresol content) , potency 
(bioidentity) and safety related tests(sterility, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins). 
In the initial submission the specification was based on essential parameters of the USP finished 
product monograph for teriparatide solution for injection. A MO was raised requesting the acceptance 
criteria for assay, purity and impurities (by RP-HPLC and SEC) to be appropriately revised to account 
for the requirements of ICHQ6B and an Article 10(4) application (biosimilar). In their response to the 
MO the Applicant established limits based on the EU reference product analytical data and taking into 
account their own manufacturing process capability. Specifications have been set based on the 
nonclinical, clinical and stability data sets and the limits were tightened during the procedure in line 
with batch data.  Overall the parameters and the corresponding limits are acceptable and the MO was 
resolved. 
Identity is confirmed by RP-HPLC in comparison to reference standard, and relative potency also 
confirming identity is quantified by a cell-based assay. RP-HPLC is used for assay, and a second RP-
HPLC procedure is applied for determination of purity and selected impurities. Purity in terms of size 
variants is addressed by SEC. Pharmaceutical particulars are covered: physical appearance, extractable 
volume, osmolality, particulate matter, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022

During the procedure, a MO was raised in relation to the absence of a comprehensive nitrosamine risk 
evaluation on potential risk factors for nitrosamine formation in the active substance, finished product 
solution and primary packaging process. In response, the applicant provided a risk evaluation 
concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities, applying the principles outlined in the “Assessment 
report Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004” (EMA/369136/2020)”. Since the 
AS is being manufactured by fermentation process using E. coli bacteria, the presence of N-nitroso 
amine impurities is scientifically not possible. No risk was identified. In addition, batch analysis using a 
verified method confirmed nitrosamine impurities to be below the detection limits of the specified batch 
samples. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. The MO was considered 
resolved. 
Analytical procedures 
The information on the analytical methods used was initially insufficient and a MO was raised 
requesting sufficiently detailed descriptions for each analytical method and structured inclusion in the 
dossier in view of product lifecycle management of potential. Likewise, consistent information on 
validation of analytical procedures was requested. Following the response to the MO all analytical 
methods have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. Adequate validation data was provided in summary tables. Method 
verification was provided for compendial test methods. MO was consequently resolved. 
Reference standards 
The specification and the results of the in-house teriparatide reference standard qualification and shelf-
life determination have been submitted. The in-house standard is calibrated against the EP CRS.  
Information on the metacresol reference material used for quantification of metacresol in the FP is 
provided. 
Batch analyses 
Release data have been provided for 15 batches. These comprise development/ pilot clinical trial 
batches, pivotal clinical trial batches, and commercial scale (PV) batches. All batches comply with the 
proposed specification.  
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months 
under long term conditions (5 ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches have been manufactured at a 
development site, but could be accepted as primary stability batches since comparability between 
these batches and commercial batches  manufactured at the proposed site is considered demonstrated. 
The stability batches were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for stability indicating parameters covering physical characteristics, identity, 
purity, potency and safety related tests. Of note that for one batch an OOS result was obtained with 
respect to main peak purity after 24 months of storage at real-time conditions. The OOS was 
investigated and a root cause identified (delay in sample analysis, storage of sample at room 
temperature); therefore, no concerns derive from it. 
Additional stability data were presented for the 4 process validation batches for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (5 ± 3ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60% RH). 
All data comply with the specification. Data on visible particles have been generated after 29 months of 
storage. These confirm absence of visible particles, and support the conclusion that visible particles are 
absent over the entire shelf-life; this is accepted. Under accelerated conditions, OOS results have been 
reported for purity by RP-HPLC for some samples after 6 months storage. This is in line with 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 20/57 
 
 
 
expectations as teriparatide is sensitive to temperature, and supports the proposed storage conditions 
(5 ±3ºC) 
Photostability study was performed demonstrating that teriparatide solution is light sensitive, but 
sufficiently protected when packed in cartons. 
An in-use stability study was performed with two batches of Kauliv. The results complied with the 
specification and support the claimed in-use stability of 28 days. Additionally, the stability of the 
product during the real use scenario of 28 days at 2-8°C was established by a simulated in-use 
stability study. The preservative efficacy and sterility were also done at the end of 28 day period. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with the storage conditions 
(Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C); Do not freeze; Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to 
protect from light); as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Biosimilarity  
The Applicant performed an analytical comparability study to evaluate similarity of Kauliv to Forsteo 
(EU), Forteo (US) and Forteo (India) on the quality level. As the pivotal clinical PK study was 
performed (amongst others) with Forsteo (EU), the summary of the results is focused on the 
comparability of Kauliv to the EU sourced Forsteo. Information on comparability to Forteo (US) and 
Forteo (India) are not considered relevant and hence, are not discussed in the context of this 
application. 
Multiple batches of Stelis Teriparatide finished product were compared with multiple batches of EU 
sourced Forsteo. The similarity report was presented in the form of the overlay of 
spectrums/chromatograms (wherever possible), tables containing observed results, statistical analysis 
(wherever possible; especially for quantitative results), equivalence tests and the result summary. 
Forsteo samples sourced from the EU were treated as a reference for all the similarity experiments. 
The following quality attributes were investigated: 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 21/57 
 
 
 
The primary structure of test and reference products was investigated by intact mass, peptide mass 
fingerprinting and peptide mapping with MS and MS/MS confirming the sequence. Secondary structure 
was investigated by far UV CD, FTIR, NMR. Test and reference product were found to be identical in 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 22/57 
 
 
 
 
 
terms of primary structure and similarity with respect to secondary structure could be confirmed. 
Likewise, analysis of charged variants and the determination of the isoelectric point did not reveal 
differences. Size variants were comprehensively investigated by SEC, SEC-MALS, DLS and AUC. In 
both products, only minor amounts of HMWs were detected. In most cases, the monomer content was 
near 100%.  
Related substances were investigated by RP-HPLC. Numerical values for all test and reference product 
batches included in the study are stated peak-wise (RRT).  Acceptance criteria for similarity were not 
clearly pre-defined in terms of impurities. However, in the Applicant’s own data evaluation, impurities 
were compared based on quality ranges. Stelis teriparatide FP displays a similar impurity profile as 
Forsteo. RP-HPLC data support the similarity claim. 
The teriparatide content of Kauliv and Forsteo was determined using RP-HPLC in comparison to the in-
house reference standard. It is acknowledged that the actually measured content of teriparatide in 
both products was compared. In this respect, the products are deemed comparable.  
Potency of Kauliv and the RMP Forsteo was compared by a cell-based assay using UMR-106 cells. The 
products could not be directly compared, but each relative to the identical reference standard, which is 
acceptable. The potency results show similar biological activity.  
Size-related variants are comparable between test and reference product. Kauliv might contain 
product-related impurities emerging from the Tag fusion protein, called “precursor” in the Applicant’s 
risk assessment. Residual Tag may pose a risk for immunogenicity and might alter the safety profile of 
Kauliv in comparison to the reference product. The potential presence /desired absence of the 
precursor-related impurities has been addressed in the analytical similarity study by making reference 
to the data on process validation/ depletion of impurities. It can be concluded that the levels of Tag 
impurities are well controlled. Comparative degradation studies under accelerated/ stress conditions 
were performed; they support the similarity claim.  
Statistics  
Overall, the Applicant missed to present an appropriately justified statistical evaluation approach for 
the analytical similarity study. It is noted that most of the data were evaluated based on quality 
ranges. The statistical evaluation as proposed by the Applicant does not add any relevant information; 
however, the data provided allow for an overall conclusion on similarity.  
Conclusion 
Considering the uncertainty deriving from the initially presented inadequate information about the 
analytical methods used for the AS and FP a MO had been raised since the missing information 
precluded a definite conclusion on biosimilarity. However following the resolution of the MOs relating to 
the analytical methods and their validation as well as the responses to all the issues raised as other 
concerns with regards to biosimilarity, the MO on the biosimilarity conclusion was resolved and 
biosimilarity of Kauliv to reference product Forsteo can be concluded. The precursor-related impurities 
are present at very low levels, not jeopardizing analytical similarity.  
2.2.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacturing process contain any material human or animal origin. 
There is no risk form TSE or viral contamination.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The teriparatide active substance upstream manufacturing process is a conventional fed batch process. 
In the downstream process the AS is subjected to multiple purification steps. The description of the 
manufacturing process contains essential information. The information on control of critical steps and 
intermediates is considered acceptable. A minor unresolved quality issue, having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, pertains to revising the preliminary IPC acceptance criteria for cell 
lysis efficiency. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality 
development.  
Characterisation of the active substance has been performed using state-of-the-art analytical 
techniques. Process validation follows a traditional approach. Information on the removal and 
clearance of process related substances is considered acceptable. For the control of the process-related 
Tag impurity specifically, a new ELISA analytical method has been implemented into the AS 
specification together with an adequate acceptance criterion. The AS specification is mainly based on 
the Ph. Eur. Monograph and is acceptable.  
All MOs raised during the procedure in relation to the AS, pertaining to the GMP compliance of the 
proposed manufacturing sites, the removal of process related impurities including Tag impurity, the 
comparison of manufacturing processes used for pre-clinical and clinical materials with the proposed 
commercial process, the characterisation of teriparatide and the deficiencies of analytical procedures, 
have been resolved by the applicant providing all the requested information and updating the dossier 
accordingly. 
The finished product composition was developed to be biosimilar to Forsteo. The finished product 
manufacturing process is straight-forward, consisting of compounding steps, sterile filtration and an 
aseptic fill- and finish process.  
The description of the analytical procedures applied for finished product control and respective 
validation summaries for the analytical procedures are acceptable. The finished product specifications 
for release and shelf-life is deemed acceptable. An overall acceptable systematic risk assessment with 
respect to nitrosamines has been provided. The claimed shelf-life for the finished product was 
substantiated by appropriate data.  
All MOs raised in relation to the FP, pertaining to the GMP compliance of the proposed manufacturing 
sites, the deficiencies of analytical procedures, the initially proposed specifications, the risk evaluation 
concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities, and the initial  uncertainty in concluding 
biosimilarity, have been resolved by the applicant providing all the requested information and updating 
the dossier accordingly. 
Biosimilarity of Kauliv to reference product Forsteo can be concluded. From the information provided 
on the Tag impurity, it can be concluded that the precursor-related impurities are present at very low 
levels, not jeopardizing analytical similarity. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Following the substantial updated information provided 
during the procedure and the respective dossier updates, the results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to revise the acceptance criterion for PTH value used for control of cell lysis efficiency at step 6, once 
the data from sufficient number of batches. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The active ingredient of Kauliv is recombinant teriparatide consisting of the first 34 N-terminal amino 
acids (molecular weight of 4117.7 Da) of the native human 84-amino acid hormone PTH. Kauliv has 
been developed as biosimilar to the European reference product Forsteo with Eli Lilly Nederlands B.V. 
as the Marketing Authorisation Holder. The non-clinical programme for the development of Kauliv 
focused on the investigation of comparability and aimed at the demonstration of similarity between 
Kauliv and the reference medicinal product Forsteo. 
The Kauliv nonclinical development program is based on two vitro cell-based potency assays (UMR-106 
and CHO-K1 cell-based bioassays) and receptor-binding studies using surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR). 
The following table provides an overview of the presented studies.

In the cell-based potency assays cAMP levels were measured. Potencies of Kauliv and the reference 
product Forsteo were expressed as relative potencies compared to a reference teriparatide standard. 
The Applicant did not compare Kauliv and the reference product Forsteo directly, i.e. head-to-head in 
one experiment due to plate layout restrictions. The Applicant was asked for more detailed information 
and, although not completely in line with the guidelines, the reasoning of the Applicant was considered 
acceptable. Furthermore, the Applicant was asked to justify the deviation from the applicable  guideline 
by comparing only a single concentration (EC50) and not a set of concentrations covering the range 
where potential differences are most sensitively detected. In response the The Applicant showed that 
the obtained dose dependent response is symmetrical with distinct upper and lower asymptotes and a 
linear range, meaning that the horizontal shift in EC50 value is a true representation of relative 
potency with respect to standard. 
The summary of mean and SD of relative potency (RP) data results compared to USP reference 
standard for EU Forsteo® lots and Kauliv lots are summarized in the below tables:

Relative potencies determined for Kauliv were in both cell lines within the mean ± 2 SD of the 
reference product Forsteo. The Applicant bases the evaluation of the results of the biosimilarity studies 
on Mean ± Standard deviations of the EU reference product Forsteo and different values of up to ± 3 
SD are provided. No clear rationale or guideline was provided by the Applicant for the application of 
this type of comparison. The Applicant was asked to justify. In response the Applicant justified the 
statistical analysis of the biosimilarity results. To accommodate for the natural variations in the 
manufacturing processes and also variability arising from analytical instruments, 90% confidence 
intervals were used with reference ranges established using mean +/-3 standard deviations (which 
covers 99% of the reference range). 
Neither study documentations nor raw data could be found in the initially submitted dossier. The 
Applicant was asked to provide the original experimental study documentations of the functional in-
vitro cell-based studies including all raw data as well. The Applicant submitted raw data files but these 
raw data did not enable a full understanding of the following of the calculations of the in-vitro relative 
potency values stated in the non-clinical overview. In response to requests the Applicant provided 
initially missing information on how the relative potency values stated in the non-clinical overview were 
derived in detail.  
In addition to the above cell-based platforms, the binding kinetics of Kauliv to the PTH1 receptors was 
evaluated using SPR (surface plasmon resonance). The KD values calculated are considered beingwere 
within mean ± 2 SD of the reference product Forsteo and, therefore, considered similar.

From a non-clinical point of view the in-vitro data provided by the Applicant indicate that both 
products, Kauliv and Forsteo, are functionally comparable. Nevertheless, these in-vitro data are only a 
part of the exercise of demonstration of biosimilarity between Forsteo and Kauliv. Therefore, the final 
decision, whether Kauliv and Forsteo may be considered biosimilar is to a large part dependent on the 
Quality assessment of the product (please, see Quality assessment report for details). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No non-clinical studies investigating pharmacokinetics of Kauliv have been provided. This is considered 
acceptable considering the type of application (Biosimilar). Pharmacokinetics of teriparatide are well 
known. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The Applicant has performed 28 day repeated dose toxicity studies with daily subcutaneous 
administration of Kauliv in rats and rabbits in order to comply with Non-European regulative 
requirements. As stated in the applicable  guideline in vitro assays may often be more specific and 
sensitive to detect differences between the biosimilar and the reference product than studies in 
animals. The repeated dose toxicity studies performed by the Applicant are not considered relevant in 
order to assess biosimilarity of the product under review to the reference product.  
The highest doses administered in the studies (5.2 µg/kg/day in rabbits and 10.3 µg/kg/day in rats) 
are reported as NOAELs. No skin reactions different from the vehicle control group are reported for 
Kauliv treated animals. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a peptide, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment. Therefore, teriparatide is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In line with the type of application procedure the data package submitted is very limited. 
Cell based in vitro potency assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements performed in order 
to demonstrate biosimilarity of Kauliv to the reference product Forsteo indicate that receptor binding 
and triggering of intracellular second messenger (cAMP) response of Kauliv and Forsteo are similar. 
Based on results from repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and rabbits which are not considered 
relevant from biosimilarity point of view, there are no non-clinical concerns regarding local toxicity of 
Kauliv. 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 28/57 
 
 
 
The wording of SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 is in line with that of the reference product Forsteo. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Results of the very limited data package supports biosimilarity from non-clinical point of view, although 
the final decision regarding biosimilarity of Kauliv to Forsteo depends on the Quality assessment of the 
product.  
From non-clinical point of view there is no objection against marketing authorisation of the product 
under review. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The Applicant has provided results from 2 clinical PK/PD studies, a pivotal 3-way comparative PK/PD 
study between Kauliv and the EU reference product Forsteo as well as the US comparator Forteo and a

2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
In addition to the physicochemical, structural, and biological characterisation and the nonclinical data, 
the Applicant has provided results from 2 clinical PK/PD studies (see above). 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to characterise the PK of teriparatide. 
Information on general PK properties of teriparatide are based on the published documentation of the 
reference medicinal product Forsteo. This is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
The volume of distribution for teriparatide is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life is approximately 1 
hour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the 
injection site. 
No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide, but the peripheral 
metabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. 
Teriparatide is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in 
women and 94 L/hr in men). 
No differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 85 
years). Dosage adjustment based on age is not required.

For the current biosimilar MAA, in addition to the physicochemical, structural, and biological 
characterisation and the nonclinical data, the Applicant has provided results from 2 clinical PK/PD 
studies, a pivotal 3-way and a 2-way pilot PK/PD study.  
Pivotal Study PTH/CT1-002/R5 
The pivotal trial compared PK, PD, and safety aspects of the test product Stelis Teriparatide with the 
EU reference product Forsteo and the US reference product Forteo in a 3-period, single-dose, cross-
over design; the 3 treatment periods were separated by a washout period of at least 1 week.  
The design including the washout period of ≥1 week and the chosen study population are considered 
acceptable. Aspects regarding the treatments used in the study have been reported and the chosen 
reference product is endorsed. 
The study objectives and the chosen endpoints are in general adequate for the assessment of 
biosimilarity between test and reference product. Aspects of immunogenicity have not been 
investigated in this trial. PK and PD sampling time points are considered adequate.  
The sample size has been calculated by customary methods, using valid assumptions and is considered 
in line with current guidance and approved products.  
Randomisation and blinding are considered adequate; blind of study subjects to the device used was 
maintained. 
For the determination of teriparatide concentrations in human serum samples, an automated system 
together with a commercially available kit (IDI iSYS Immunoanalyzer Automated Chemiluminescence 
Method) was used. It is stated that anti-PTH(1-34) antibodies are used in this kit which have been 
derivatised to act either as capture or detection antibodies. The assay was validated with respect to 
the relevant parameters, i.e. accuracy and precision (intra-, inter-assay), dynamic range (~8 - 400 
pg/mL). The LLOQ was determined to be 8 pg/mL. Selectivity experiments were limited to analysis of 
blank samples, 9 out of 10 were below LLOQ. Interference with human blood was observed and 
corresponds to the instructions for use from the kit supplier. The kit manufacturer states that 
interference with native PTH (1-84) is as low as 4%. Specificity for teriparatide (PTH 1-34) was 
demonstrated by analysis of PTH(1-84) spiked samples at various concentrations. No interference 
occurred at PTH (1-84) levels of 15.6, 164, and 557 pg/mL (all results < LLOQ). Thus, interference of 
the teriparatide quantification assay with native PTH can be excluded.  
For measuring serum ionised calcium standard diagnostic methods have been used.  
As regards statistical methods, the standard approach for bioequivalence analysis was followed in 
accordance with the relevant EMA guideline for primary analysis. The influence of outliers and potential 
unreliable PK parameters was adequately assessed by sensitivity analyses. For PD analysis, EU 
standard for equivalence analysis is 95% CI, but this was provided as well. A document called 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final 1.0 dated 12 July 2018 has been found in the dossier.  
As per protocol 78 healthy subjects were randomised to 1 of the 6 treatment sequence groups and 68 
out of 78 (87.2%) subjects completed the study; AEs (5/10; 50.0%) accounted for the most common 
cause for premature withdrawal. Nine (9) subjects discontinued the study early; of these, all but 1 
subject received at least 2 treatments. 
Information on study amendments has been provided; as regards sample size and subject enrolment it 
is stated that there have been 5 protocol revisions. 
Overall, there was a higher than expected number of haemolysed samples. According to the Applicant 
thorough root cause analysis was undertaken, but no single root cause could be identified; it is 
hypothesised that this is an artefact due to the high frequency of PK sample collections.  
Groups were sufficiently balanced with regard to demographic and other baseline characteristics except 
that 53 out of 78 subjects were female (67.9%). Since all subjects served as her / his own control, this 
is not considered to influence the PK / PD results.

Overall, 6.4% of subjects missed a Kauliv, 5.1% a Forsteo, and 1.3% a Forteo dose.  
The most commonly reported concomitant medications were anilides and there was a significant 
difference in anilides use between prior and post first dose (3/78, 3.8% prior first dose; 15/78, 19.2% 
post first dose).  
Arithmetic mean plasma concentration-time profiles and PK parameters of teriparatide were 
comparable between the 3 products investigated. Median tmax was approximately 0.250 hours, 
geometric mean t1/2 ranged between 0.7834 and 0.8541 hours, and CL/F and Vz/F were also 
comparable across treatments. Stelis Teriparatide generally had the lowest GCV% across all 
treatments.

Numerous subjects had missing data due to missing or haemolysed samples at various time points of 
the PK profile. No specific handling for PK parameter exclusion based on missing data was performed 
for the planned primary analysis.  
Multiple subjects had quantifiable predose concentrations >5% of Cmax. The Applicant argues that most 
likely haemolysis has led to these detectable pre-dose concentrations and that there is a lack of 
evidence of PTH(1-84) interference on the teriparatide assay. 
The 90% CIs as well as the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the primary analysis including 
only subjects with evaluable paired PK/PD data for each of the treatment comparisons the PK 
parameters AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax were within the predefined acceptance limits for the definition of 
biosimilarity of 80.00% to 125.00% for Stelis Teriparatide versus Forsteo, Stelis Teriparatide versus 
Forteo, and Forsteo versus Forteo.  
However, geometric mean ratios for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-inf and AUC0-t do not pass through 
unity. The observed AUC for the test product Kauliv is approximately 11% higher than the reference 
product. It is hypothesised that this may be due to the higher number of missing or haemolysed 
samples in the reference group.

The sensitivity analysis of the 90% and 95% CIs supported the primary findings. Confidence intervals 
of the geometric mean ratios for the AUC0 t and Cmax were also within the predefined acceptance limits 
of 80.00% to 125.00% for all treatment comparisons and were passing through unity, indicating that 
the missing samples might have impacted the 90% and 95% confidence intervals of the geometric 
mean ratios for PK parameters not passing through unity.

Source: Table 14.2.3.3 
Using method 2, which included subjects who had at least 1 dose with any evaluable data, statistical 
analysis results were comparable to those seen with method 1 for the primary and secondary PK 
parameters, both for the full data set and excluding outliers.  
The intra-subject CV% was generally acceptable for all primary PK parameters ranging between 14.1% 
to 22.7% for method 1 and 17.7% to 21.2% for method 2. The inter-subject CV% for all primary PK 
parameters ranged between 36.2% to 52.4% for method 1 and 25.1% to 31.5% for method 2. Since 
all subjects served as her / his own control the high inter-subject coefficient of variation is not 
considered to influence the interpretation of the results. 
Supportive data pilot study PTH/CT1-001/R0 
Supportive data are available from the pilot single-centre, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study 
PTH/CT1-001/R0 comparing PK and PD aspects of Stelis Teriparatide with Forsteo. 
The overall design of this study including the wash-out period of 4 weeks and the main inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are considered acceptable.  
Objectives are adequate to investigate PK / PD biosimilarity. Primary and secondary PK endpoints are

considered appropriate and exploratory PD endpoints are also endorsed. The measurement of 
teriparatide  
antibodies as a safety endpoint is considered to be of limited value as the study includes only a single 
administration of the test product followed by the reference product or vice versa; however, the wash-
out period of 4 weeks is considered adequate in this regard. 
PK sample time-points every 5 minutes during the first study phase would have been more appropriate 
considering the rapid absorption of teriparatide. 
The sample size is limited to 30 subjects. Randomisation including stratification by injection site and 
blinding are considered adequate; subjects were blinded to the device used.  
According to the Applicant, the analytical method used to determine teriparatide concentrations was 
identical to that used in the pivotal trial. 
The Applicant used a commercially available kit together with commercially available controls to 
analyse intact PTH concentrations in plasma. Validation data have been provided.  
As in the pivotal trial, standard methods for measuring serum ionised calcium have been used.  
According to the study protocol, for safety data anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies 
needed to be assessed. For the assessment of ADA analytical method ALM172 was developed and 
validation data have been provided. As no antibodies to teriparatide have been detected the assay for 
detecting neutralising antibodies has not been applied despite the Applicant’s statement that 
immunogenicity results were presented for neutralising antibodies. 
Descriptive statistics have been applied.  
Thirty (30) subjects were enrolled and randomised to 2 treatment sequences, TR and RT (15 subjects 
each). A total of 12 subjects in sequence TR and 13 in sequence RT completed the study as per 
protocol; the most common reason for discontinuation was withdrawn consent (4 subjects, 2 per 
sequence). 
Data from only 8 out of 30 subjects were included in the primary analysis; 12 subjects had at least one 
evaluable exposure parameter and 8 had results for AUC0-inf in both treatment periods and were 
included in the primary analysis, 28 subjects had evaluable exposure parameters in at least one 
treatment period and were included in the secondary analysis. 
The protocol amendment and the reported protocol deviations are not considered to have influenced 
the study results.The study included more male (66.7%) than female (33.3%) subjects; the mean 
(SD) age was 26 (6) years. Demographics and baseline characteristics were sufficiently balanced 
between groups. 
Teriparatide was rapidly absorbed following administration of both test and reference product with a 
median tmax of 10 minutes for both treatments. Elimination was rapid with a geometric mean t1/2 of 
approximately 1 hour. More than 80% of AUC0-inf was generally characterised for both treatments. 
Geometric mean teriparatide Cmax was dependant on the site of administration, 48% and 85% higher 
when injected in the abdominal wall than the thigh in the test and the reference groups, respectively, 
while AUC0-inf did not appear to be meaningfully impacted by injection site. The upper range of tmax was 
shorter following administration into the abdominal wall compared to the thigh, which might explain 
the higher Cmax with this route of administration.

Thirteen (13) out of 29 subjects had either no quantifiable postdose concentrations or limited 
consecutive or intermittently quantifiable concentrations following Stelis Teriparatide treatment and PK 
parameters were not determined. The cause was investigated and according to the Applicant, the most 
possible reason was incomplete or null dosing of the test product Stelis Teriparatide probably due to 
ineffective priming of the device used in this study although according to the study report test and 
reference products were administered by trained study centre staff.  
For pen device / human factors assessment please see assessment of Quality aspects.  
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to characterise the PD properties of 
teriparatide. Available information is based on the documentation of the reference medicinal product 
Forsteo. This is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
Endogenous PTH, an 84-amino acid peptide, plays a central role in calcium and phosphate metabolism 
in bone and kidneys. Its physiological effects include stimulation of bone formation by directly affecting 
osteoblasts and by increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate as well 
as indirectly increasing intestinal absorption of calcium via its effects on 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 
production. Teriparatide is the active fragment (1-34) of endogenous human PTH.  
Teriparatide and PTH mediate their biological effects via specific, G-protein-dependent, high-affinity 
membrane cell-surface receptors which are expressed on osteoblasts and renal tubular cells. Both 
molecules exert similar physiological effects on bone and kidneys. These effects lead to increases in 
bone strength of the spine, hip, and peripheral anatomic sites as well as a decreased fracture risk. The 
stimulation of bone resorption and formation is dose dependant.  
Treatment with teriparatide increases 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentrations and decreases 25-
hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations. This effect may contribute to the biological effects of 
teriparatide, for example, to stabilise calcium balance by increasing intestinal calcium absorption and 
renal calcium conservation. 
Pharmacodynamic information with the applied medicinal product has been provided from the pivotal 
and the pilot PK/PD comparability studies; both included secondary endpoints to assess PD similarity 
between Kauliv and the EU reference product Forsteo after a single 20 µg dose of teriparatide. For the 
pivotal study PTH/CT1-002/R5 observed and change from baseline ionised serum calcium 
concentrations have been reported, while for the pilot study PTH/CT1-001/R0 PD parameters were 
observed and change from baseline serum ionised calcium as well as endogenous intact PTH (1-84) 
and change from baseline concentrations were observed. 
For methods as well as participant flow, conduct of the studies, and baseline data please see

Pivotal Study PTH/CT1-002/R5 
In the pivotal trial PTH/CT1-002/R5 the mean observed serum ionised calcium concentrations briefly 
decreased with trough values around 2 to 3 hours postdose before transiently increasing for all 
products. The observed mean change from baseline (CFB) and percent CFB concentration-time profiles 
were comparable across treatment arms.

Serum ionised calcium concentrations increased transiently after dosing with both Stelis Teriparatide 
and Forsteo and peaked at 4 hours post-dose, while concentrations on lead-in Day -1 appeared 
relatively flat. Serum ionised concentrations remained higher than lead-in concentrations through 6 
hours postdose. Serum ionised calcium concentrations appeared higher after treatment with Stelis 
Teriparatide then with Forsteo, but median concentrations were comparable between treatments.

Concentrations of intact endogenous PTH in plasma were partially suppressed after treatment with 
both Stelis Teriparatide and Forsteo for up to 6 hours postdose. The observed decrease in intact 
endogenous PTH was greater with Forsteo than Stelis Teriparatide treatment; mean and median Cmin 
following Stelis Teriparatide treatment were 18.57 pg/ml and 17.2 pg/ml compared to 16.48 pg/ml and 
16.1 pg/ml with Forsteo, respectively. 
Overall, the degree of suppression of plasma concentrations of intact endogenous PTH was highly 
variable in this study.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In addition to the physicochemical, structural, and biological characterisation and the nonclinical data, 
the Applicant has provided results from 2 clinical PK/PD studies, a pivotal 3-way comparative study 
between Kauliv and the EU reference product Forsteo as well as the US comparator Forteo and a pilot 
2-way study comparing Kauliv with Forsteo. The primary objective of these studies was the comparison 
of the PK profiles of Kauliv and the reference product. PD comparison (i.e. ionised calcium) was a 
secondary endpoint. This is acceptable. 
In both studies, teriparatide concentrations in human serum samples were measured using an 
automated system together with a commercially available kit (IDI iSYS Immunoanalyzer Automated 
Chemiluminescence Method). The assay was validated with respect to the relevant parameters. 
Interference with human blood was observed and corresponds to the instructions for use from the kit 
supplier. Interference of the teriparatide quantification assay with native PTH can be excluded. 
For measuring serum ionised calcium standard diagnostic methods have been used.  
For the pivotal trial the design including the wash-out period of ≥1 week and the chosen study 
population, reference product, study objectives, and endpoints are in general adequate for the 
assessment of biosimilarity between test and reference product. Aspects of immunogenicity have not 
been investigated in this pivotal trial.  
As regards statistical methods, the standard approach for bioequivalence analysis was followed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 43/57 
 
 
 
 
 
accordance with the relevant EMA guideline for primary analysis. The influence of outliers and potential 
unreliable PK parameters was adequately assessed by sensitivity analyses.  
As per protocol 78 subjects were randomised to 1 of the 6 treatment sequence groups and 68 out of 
78 (87.2%) completed the study; AEs (5/10; 50.0%) accounted for the most common cause for 
premature withdrawal.  
Groups were sufficiently balanced with regard to demographic and other baseline characteristics. 
Overall, 6.4% of subjects missed a Kauliv, 5.1% a Forsteo, and 1.3% a Forteo dose.  
The most commonly reported concomitant medications were anilides and there was a significant 
difference in anilides use between prior and post first dose. 
Arithmetic mean plasma concentration-time profiles and PK parameters of teriparatide were 
comparable between the 3 products investigated.  
Numerous subjects had missing data due to missing or haemolysed samples at various time points of 
the PK profile; the number of haemolysed samples was higher than expected. According to the 
Applicant thorough root cause analysis was undertaken, but no single root cause could be identified; it 
is hypothesised that this is an artefact due to the high frequency of PK sample collections. No specific 
handling for PK parameter exclusion based on missing data was performed for the primary analysis. 
Multiple subjects had quantifiable predose concentrations >5% of Cmax. The Applicant argues that most 
likely haemolysis has led to these detectable pre-dose concentrations and that there is a lack of 
evidence of PTH(1-84) interference on the teriparatide assay. 
The 90% CIs as well as the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the primary analysis of the 
PK parameters AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax were within the predefined acceptance limits, but geometric 
mean ratios for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-inf and AUC0-t do not pass through unity. The observed 
AUC for the test product Kauliv is approximately 11% higher than the reference product. It is 
hypothesised that this may be due to the higher number of missing or haemolysed samples in the 
reference group. Sensitivity analyses supported the primary findings as did analyses using method 2, 
which included subjects who had at least 1 dose with any evaluable data.  
The supportive data from the pilot single-centre, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study PTH/CT1-
001/R0 are limited by the high number of subject without quantifiable teriparatide concentrations. 
Thirty (30) subjects were enrolled and randomised, but data from only 8 out of 30 subjects were 
included in the primary analysis. Thirteen (13) out of 29 subjects had either no quantifiable postdose 
concentrations or limited consecutive or intermittently quantifiable concentrations following Stelis 
Teriparatide treatment and PK parameters were not determined. The cause was investigated and 
according to the Applicant, the most possible reason was incomplete or null dosing of the test product 
Stelis Teriparatide probably due to ineffective priming of the device used in this study although 
according to the study report, test and reference products were administered by trained study centre 
staff. In the pilot study geometric mean teriparatide AUC0-inf was 10% lower following Stelis 
Teriparatide administration compared to Forsteo (90% CI 80.80% to 100.45%); geometric mean 
teriparatide Cmax was 13% higher with Stelis Teriparatide compared to Forsteo (90% CI 91.63% to 
139.49%).  
As regards pharmacodynamic parameters in the pivotal trial PTH/CT1-002/R5 observed, mean CFB, 
and percent CFB concentration-time profiles were comparable across treatment arms; mean observed 
serum ionised calcium concentrations briefly decreased with trough values around 2 to 3 hours 
postdose before transiently increasing for all products. Pharmacokinetics of teriparatide and mean CFB 
serum ionised calcium concentrations indicated an indirect response relationship. 
In the pilot study PTH/CT1-001/R0 serum ionised calcium concentrations increased transiently after 
dosing with both Stelis Teriparatide and Forsteo and peaked at 4 hours post-dose, while concentrations 
on lead-in Day -1 appeared relatively flat. Concentrations were higher with Stelis Teriparatide then 
with Forsteo, but median concentrations were comparable.

Concentrations of intact endogenous PTH in plasma were partially suppressed after treatment with 
both Stelis Teriparatide and Forsteo for up to 6 hours postdose; the decrease was greater with Forsteo 
than Stelis Teriparatide treatment. Overall, the degree of suppression of plasma concentrations of 
intact endogenous PTH was highly variable in this study. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the pivotal study, the 90% CIs as well as the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the 
primary analysis of the PK parameters AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax were within the predefined acceptance 
limits, but geometric mean ratios for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-inf and AUC0-t did not pass through 
unity. The observed AUC for the test product Kauliv is approximately 11% higher than the reference 
product Forsteo. This difference is unlikely to be clinically relevant, which is supported by similar 
changes in serum ionised calcium. Therefore, the PK/PD data support biosimilarity. 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to inform on the efficacy of teriparatide. 
Information on the efficacy of teriparatide is based on the documentation of the reference medicinal 
product Forsteo. This is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
Risk factors for osteoporosis 
Independent risk factors, e.g. low BMD, age, previous fracture, family history of hip fractures, high 
bone turnover, and low body mass index should be considered in order to identify women and men at 
increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment. 
Premenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for 
fracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk 
for fracture (e.g. low bone density, sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy, high underlying disease 
activity, low sex steroid levels). 
Postmenopausal osteoporosis 
The pivotal study included 1,637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, 90% of 
the patients had one or more vertebral fractures and on average vertebral BMD was 0.82 g/cm2 
(equivalent to a T-score of -2.6). All patients were offered 1,000 mg calcium and at least 400 IU 
vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median 19 months) treatment with Forsteo 
demonstrated statistically significant fracture reduction (see table below); to prevent one or more new 
vertebral fracture, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months. After a median of 19 
months of treatment, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the lumbar spine and total hip, 
respectively, by 9% and 4% compared with placebo (p<0.001).

In a post-treatment follow-up study, 1,262 postmenopausal women from the pivotal trial were 
enrolled. The primary objective was to collect safety data of teriparatide. During this observational 
period, other osteoporosis treatments were allowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures 
was performed. During a median of 18 months following discontinuation of teriparatide, there was a 
41% reduction (p=0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one 
new vertebral fracture.  
In an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture 
within the previous 3 years (83% had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with 
teriparatide for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine, 
total hip, and femoral neck BMD were 10.5%, 2.6%, and 3.9% respectively. The mean increases in 
BMD from 18 to 24 months were 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.6% at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral 
neck, respectively.  
A 24-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled phase 4 study included 1,360 
postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis; 680 subjects were randomised to teriparatide 
and 680 to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a mean age of 72.1 years and a 
median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received previous bisphosphonate 
therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. The 24-month follow-up was 
completed by 1,013 (74.5%) patients. The mean (median) cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 
474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate arm. The mean (median) 
vitamin D intake in the teriparatide and in the risedronate arm were 1,433 IU/day (1,400 IU/day) and 
1,191 IU/day (900 IU/day), respectively. For those subjects who had baseline and follow-up spine 
radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in teriparatide- and 64/533 
(12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients (relative risk [95% CI] = 0.44 [0.29-0.68], P<0.0001). The 
cumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures) was 
4.8% in teriparatide and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.48 [0.32-
0.74], P=0.0009). 
Male osteoporosis 
In a clinical trial in men with hypogonadal (defined as low morning free testosterone or elevated FSH 
or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis 437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled. Baseline spinal 
and femoral neck BMD mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively. At baseline, 35% of patients 
had a vertebral fracture and 59% had a non-vertebral fracture.  
All patients were offered 1,000 mg calcium and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar spine BMD 
significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar spine and total 
hip by 5% and 1%, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant effect on fracture 
rates was demonstrated.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis  
The efficacy of teriparatide in men and women (N=428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid 
therapy (≥5 mg prednisone for ≥3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-month primary phase of a 36 
month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study (alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight 
percent (28%) of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral fracture at baseline. All patients 
were offered 1,000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D per day.  
This study included postmenopausal women (N=277), premenopausal women (N=67), and men 
(N=83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine 
BMD T-score of −2.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar 
spine BMD T-score of −2.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9% had one or 
more radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD 
T-score of −2.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24% had one or more 
radiographic vertebral fractures.  
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of the patients completed the 18-month primary phase. At the 18 month 
endpoint, teriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2%) compared with alendronate 
(3.4%) (p<0.001). Teriparatide compared with alendronate increased BMD at the total hip (3.6% 
versus 2.2%, p<0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7% versus 2.1%, p<0.05). In patients treated 
with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 and 24 months 
by an additional 1.7%, 0.9%, and 0.4%, respectively.  
At 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate and 173 teriparatide treated patients 
showed that 13 (7.7%) patients in the alendronate and 3 (1.7%) patients in the teriparatide group 
(p=0.01) had experienced a new vertebral fracture. In addition, 15 of 214 patients (7.0%) in the 
alendronate and 16 of 214 patients in the teriparatide group (7.5%) had experienced a non-vertebral 
fracture (p=0.84).  
In premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to the 18 month endpoint was 
significantly greater in the teriparatide compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine 
(4.2% versus −1.9%; p<0.001) and total hip (3.8% versus 0.9%; p=0.005). However, no significant 
effect on fracture rates was demonstrated.   
Supportive data  
The Applicant conducted a literature search and refers to the data of studies, meta-analyses, and 
international clinical guidelines to support the efficacy of teriparatide in different patient populations.  
Guidelines 
The referred guidelines were released by the American College of Rheumatology and The International 
Osteoporosis Foundation and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and 
Osteoarthritis.  
The International Osteoporosis Foundation and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of 
Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis published guidance for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis 
in 2013 with an update in 2019 that includes new information on the evaluation of bone microstructure 
in facture risk assessment, the role of FRAX® and Fracture Liaison Services in secondary fracture 
prevention, long-term effects on fracture risk of dietary intakes, and increased fracture risk on 
stopping drug treatment. It states that treatment with teriparatide has been shown to significantly 
reduce the risk of vertebral and also non-vertebral fractures. There is no convincing evidence that 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 47/57 
 
 
 
teriparatide reduces hip fractures, but this may reflect an absence of evidence, not an evidence of 
absence. Thus, the recommendation for its use in high-risk people is particularly strong in patients with 
vertebral fractures. The recommended dose is 20 mcg of teriparatide, given as a subcutaneous 
injection. Treatment with PTH has been studied when given for 18 to 24 months and beneficial effects 
on non-vertebral fracture with teriparatide have been shown to persist for up to 30 months after 
stopping teriparatide. Although studies in rats have indicated an increased incidence of osteosarcoma 
with long-term administration of very high doses of teriparatide, these findings have not been 
considered relevant for patients treated with very much lower doses of teriparatide.  
The American College of Rheumatology considers that in women older than 40 years at low to 
moderate risk of fractures, if bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate, teriparatide should be used 
rather than the patient receiving no additional treatment beyond calcium and vitamin D [Buckley L, 
2017]. These recommendations were echoed by Swiss experts [Meier C, 2014]. 
Publications 
The Applicant provided an extensive overview of the available literature data to support the efficacy of 
teriparatide treatment. The literature included systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published 
pivotal clinical trials, pivotal clinical trials in postmenopausal osteoporosis, other published clinical trials 
in postmenopausal osteoporosis, premenopausal osteoporosis, patients at high risk of fracture, 
synopsis of papers on cyclicity and length of administration, and on clinical trials in non-approved 
indications. The study populations included postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, men with 
primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, and patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy. The 
referred meta-analyses were mainly based on a general, non-selected population of women and men 
with osteoporosis. 
The observed efficacy related endpoints were lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, total body bone 
mineral content, vertebral or non-vertebral fracture risk, clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fragility 
fractures, back pain, hip fracture, and health-related quality of life in various combinations throughout 
the different studies. 
The studies compared teriparatide treatment to placebo and/or to one or more of the following 
treatments: alendronate sodium, raloxifene and calcium and vitamin D alone, oestrogens and 
oestrogen/progestin, calcitonin, vitamin D analogues, denosumab, zoledronic acid, and oral 
bisphosphonates in various settings. 
Overall, the results of the provided studies are positive regarding the efficacy of teriparatide treatment. 
The Applicant provided a summary of the Human Factor activities undertaken by Owen Mumford 
Ltd. (OM), during development of the Rutland Autopen. These included two internal readability studies 
(with 6 adult subjects per each), an external readability study, a device verification summary study, 
two Stelis reusable pen formative usability studies, and a Stelis reusable pen summative usability 
study.  
The Rutland Autopen is a reusable injection pen, designed for sc. use of teriparatide Stelis injection for 
the treatment of osteoporosis. The drug will be contained within a standard 3 ml cartridge. 
The device delivers a single priming dose of 20 µl and an injection dose of 80 µl. Intended users of the 
device are HCPs, self-injecting patients, and caregivers. 
Internal readability studies were conducted by OM with two iterations of the modified Instructions for 
Use (IFU) to verify that it is readable and supports the user to carry out the intended use steps. 
Further testing was conducted by Stelis Biopharma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 48/57 
 
 
 
During the internal readability study, two participants dialled past P in error while priming the device, 
all participants successfully injected a dose in each scenario. Three (3) participants (2 in Study 1, 1 in 
Study 2) expressed a concern that they were not sure any liquid had been injected. 
Summative usability test 
The objective of this test was to show that the intended users, who are patients with osteoporosis 
(probable manual dexterity restrictions in their hands, arms, and fingers and/or reduced visual acuity, 
User group 2) and Healthcare Professionals who specialise in osteoporosis (User Group 1) can safely 
and effectively use the Teriparatide Stelis Reusable Pen Injector and the accessories (Dose Selector 
Adaptor and Release Button Extension) in the intended use environment supported by the lFU. 
Both user groups were tested in a simulated environment, which looks like a HCP office for User Group 
1 and a home for User Group 2. User Group 1 was planned to inject teriparatide into a skin pad 
attached to an observer, whereas User Group 2 was intended to inject into a skin pad attached to 
themselves, this later simulated a self-injection process. A training session was also included into this 
summative user test study. 
Formative usability study report 
The objective of this test was to show that the intended users, who are patients with osteoporosis 
(probable manual dexterity restrictions in their hands, arms, and fingers and/or reduced visual acuity, 
but experienced in self-injecting; User group 2), patients with osteoporosis, non-experienced in self-
injecting (User Group 3), and Healthcare Professionals who specialise in osteoporosis (User Group 1) 
can safely and effectively use the Teriparatide Stelis Reusable Pen Injector and the accessories (Dose 
Selector Adaptor and Release Button Extension) in the intended use environment supported by the lFU.  
All user groups were tested in a simulated environment, which meant a HCP office for User Group 1 
and a home for User groups 2 and 3. User Group 1 was planned to inject sterile water into a skin pad 
attached to an observer, whereas User Group 2 and 3 were intended to inject into a skin pad attached 
to themselves, this latter simulating a self-injection process. A training session was also included into 
this formative user test study. The number of subjects was 6, 6, and 5 for User Groups 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. Note that all subjects in the HCP group (group 1) were rheumatology nurses. 
ln total, the 17 study participants in this Formative Usability Test performed 697 tasks, of which 653 
tasks were performed successfully (with 4 close calls and 8 tasks performed with difficulty). Forty-four 
(44) tasks were performed with use errors.  
Critical and high-risk tasks most frequently performed with use error were as follows: 
•  6/17 study participants did not know they had to store this pen injector in the fridge (Critical 
task). 
•  5/17 study participants did not dial to the 'D' for dose as intended and did something else (High 
risk task). 
•  4/17 study participants did not inspect the cartridge for cloudiness (Critical task). 
It is worth noting also that there were clear differences in usability performance between self-injection 
experienced (User Group 2) and self-injection naive (User group 3) subjects.  
Supplementary formative usability study report 
The study participants in this supplementary Formative Usability Study were patients with Osteoporosis 
over the age of 65-85 (theoretical intended users of the Stelis Teriparatide Reusable Pen lnjector and 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022  
Page 49/57 
 
 
 
the accessories (Dose Selector Adaptor & Release Button Extension) as intended, in the intended use 
environment supported by the IFU. 
The demographic of these study participants was targeted at age  65-85, which was more extreme 
than that recorded in the previous Formative Usability Study. Five (5) study participants were 
recruited, with some who had manual dexterity problems and a lack of visual acuity. They were all 
aged between 65-70 years old to represent an older intended use population. 
Critical and high-risk tasks most frequently performed with use error were as follows: 
•  3/5 study participants were not able to dial to the 'P' as required in the task (high risk task). 
•  3/5 study participants were not able to dial to the 'D' as required in the task (high risk task). 
•  2/5 study participants (one reiterated the same use error twice) were not able to remove the 
needle (critical task). 
Comparison of the results of the two formative usability studies shows that a high percent of subjects 
was not able to dial the 'D' as required for dose delivery and/or 'P' as required for priming despite the 
device design enhancement between the two formative studies. Note that during the first readability 
study some subjects had doubt whether the dose was delivered successfully or not. It is also worth 
noting that during the pilot PK study 13 of 29 subjects received inadequate teriparatide doses, and this 
finding were explained by incorrect priming by the Applicant.  
Nevertheless, it seems that the design of the Stelis Reusable Teriparatide Pen Injector is acceptable 
from a technological viewpoint. The reason why some volunteers could not properly administer the 
injection is due to misunderstanding the instructions. In the light of these results, particular attention 
should be paid to the text of the PI to avoid dose administration errors. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to inform on the efficacy of teriparatide. 
Instead, reference is made to the available documentation of the reference medicinal product Forsteo. 
This is considered acceptable since a scientific bridge to the reference product has been established by 
demonstrating highly similar physicochemical, structural, and biological characteristics and equivalent 
pharmacokinetic profiles. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A dedicated efficacy study is not needed to establish biosimilarity of a teriparatide to the reference 
product.  
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to inform on the safety of teriparatide. 
Safety information for teriparatide is primarily based on the documentation of the reference medicinal 
product Forsteo. In addition, safety data of the pivotal and the pilot single-dose PK/PD studies have 
been provided. In general, this is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product. However, 
immunogenicity data are only available for the early pilot study where antibody induction has been 
assessed; no immunogenicity data are available for the pivotal trial.  
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022

2.4.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety assessment of the pivotal trial included 78 subjects; the safety analysis set included all 
subjects who received at least one dose during the study. The number of subjects who received Stelis 
Teriparatide was slightly lower (n = 73) than numbers in the Forsteo (n = 74) or Forteo (n = 77) 
groups. Two (2) subjects withdrew from the study, 1 was lost to follow-up, 1 did not complete the 
period 3 dosing period due to a family emergency, and 1 experienced AEs of elevated AST and CK.  
In the pilot study 29 (96.7%) out of the 30 subjects received treatment with 20 μg Stelis Teriparatide 
and 28 (93.3%) with Forsteo; 13 (43.3%) subjects in sequence TR and 14 (46.7%) in sequence RT 
received treatment in both periods. Two (2) subjects in sequence TR and 1 in sequence RT were 
withdrawn from the study after period 1 without receiving the treatment in period 2.  
2.4.8.2.  Adverse events 
In the pivotal trial the majority of subjects (65/78 subjects, 83.3%) experienced at least 1 adverse 
event and in 45 out of 78 subjects [57.7%; Stelis Teriparatide 24/73 (32.9%); Forsteo 18/74 
(24.3%); Forteo 20/77 (26.0%)] these were considered related to study drug. Most of the adverse 
events assessed as related to study drug were mild in severity and resolved.  
Moderate related adverse events were reported for 3/73 subjects (4.1%) after Stelis Teriparatide and 
1/77 (1.3%) after Forteo; mild related adverse events were reported for 21/73 (28.8%) of subjects 
after Stelis Teriparatide, 18/74 (24.3%) after Forsteo, and 19/77 (24.7%) after Forteo. No severe 
adverse event was considered related to study drug; a severe adverse event of enzyme level 
increased, not considered related, was experienced by 1/77 subject (1.3%) after Forteo. 
The most commonly reported AEs overall were headache [26/78 (33.3%); Stelis Teriparatide 10/73 
(13.7%); Forsteo 6/74 (8.1%); Forteo 15/77 (19.5%)] and upper respiratory tract infection [12/78 
(15.4%); Stelis Teriparatide 3/73 (4.1%); Forsteo 4/74 (5.4%); Forteo 5/77 (6.5%)].  
In the pilot Study PTH/CT1-001/R0 at least one adverse events occurred in 19/30 (63.3%) subjects, 
13/29 on Stelis Teriparatide and 13/28 (46.4%) on Forsteo. The incidence of adverse events (16/30, 
53.3%) reported as possibly or probably related to study drug was comparable between groups. No 
serious adverse events were reported. Mild adverse events were reported in 19 (63.3%) subjects and 
moderate adverse events in 2 (6.7%) subjects; these events were equally distributed across groups. 
No severe adverse events or adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were 
reported and no subject died during the study.  
Overall, the available data do not indicate relevant differences in adverse event profiles between test 
and reference products and did not identify any new or unexpected safety findings.  
Pooled safety data did also not identify significant differences in adverse event profiles between test 
and reference products. Details are summarised in the following tables.

2.4.8.3.  Immunological events 
As for methods please see Pharmacokinetics above. 
So far, information on immunogenicity is limited to the pilot study, no antibody measurement has been 
included in the pivotal study. 
Apparent discrepancies concerning actual levels of Tag impurity in Stelis Teriparatide batches have 
been clarified during the assessment and the Applicant has presented a control strategy for constantly 
and adequately controlling this impurity at a sufficiently low level by routine testing of the finished 
product. 
The new ELISA-based method was able to consistently show that Tag impurity levels in active 
substance and finished product are acceptable and significantly lower than the previously proposed 
limit. 
Furthermore, the Applicant estimated the amount of the total non-product related proteinaceous 
impurities to be below the level of 100 ppm conventionally considered for total non-product related 
proteinaceous impurities suggesting an acceptable immunogenicity risk from protein impurities. 
The Applicant has also performed a quality risk assessment to evaluate the safety risk associated with 
the tag impurity based on the residual level in the product, prior literature knowledge on the impurity 
components, clinical information, and the clearance profile during the manufacturing process. Based on 
this risk evaluation the Applicant considered that the risk from impurity in the drug product is low, 
adequately controlled, and does not pose a safety concern. 
It is therefore agreed that the potentially remaining tag impurity is not likely to pose an 
immunogenicity related safety concern in patients. 
2.4.8.4.  Post marketing experience 
According to the Applicant, there is currently no post-marketing data available; the medicinal product 
has not been marketed in any country. However, extensive post-marketing data exist for the reference 
product Forsteo first licensed in the EU in 2003 for which biosimilarity of the applied medicinal product 
is claimed by the Applicant. 
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Applicant has not provided data from dedicated studies to inform on the efficacy and safety of 
teriparatide. Safety information for teriparatide is primarily based on the documentation of the 
reference medicinal product Forsteo. In addition, safety data of the pivotal and the pilot single-dose 
PK/PD studies have been provided. In general, this is considered acceptable for a biosimilar product. 
However, immunogenicity data are only available for the early pilot study where antibody induction has 
been assessed; no immunogenicity data are available for the pivotal trial.

Overall, the available data do not indicate clear differences in adverse event profiles between test and 
reference products in the PK/PD studies and no new or unexpected safety findings have been 
identified, but interpretation is limited by the single treatment and low number of subjects included. 
However, for a biosimilar teriparatide, bridging to the safety experience gained with the reference 
product is generally possible based on analytical / functional and PK similarity. 
The only issue was the potential presence of tag in Kauliv, which may theoretically increase 
immunogenicity. According to the quality assessment, process related impurities potentially affecting 
immunogenicity can be sufficiently controlled at very low levels and adequate justification that 
remaining tag will not be of concern has been provided.  
2.4.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Sufficient evidence has been provided to conclude on a similar safety profile of Kauliv compared to the 
reference product Forsteo.

2.6.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kauliv (teriparatide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Kauliv was developed as biosimilar product to Forsteo (Eli Lilly), containing 20µg/80µL of 
recombinantly produced teriparatide. It is provided in a cartridge containing 3 mL of drug product 
solution and intended for use with the re-usable Kauliv pen.  
Therapeutic indications, posology, and route of administration proposed for Kauliv are identical to 
those for Forsteo. Forsteo is currently authorised for the following therapeutic indications within the 
EU:  
•  Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. In 
postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated.  
•  Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women 
and men at increased risk for fracture. 
The Applicant performed an analytical comparability study to evaluate similarity of Kauliv to Forsteo 
(EU), Forteo (US), and Forteo (India) on the quality level. In addition, a comparative clinical PK/PD 
study was performed to support the application. As the pivotal clinical PK study was performed 
(amongst others) with Forsteo (EU), the summary of the results is focused on the comparability of 
Assessment report  
EMA/923811/2022

Kauliv to the EU sourced Forsteo. Information on comparability to Forteo (US) and Forteo (India) are 
not considered relevant and hence, disregarded in the context of this application. 
A total of 10 batches of Stelis Teriparatide drug product were compared with 9 batches of EU sourced 
Forsteo. The similarity report is presented in the form of the overlay of spectrums/chromatograms, 
tables containing observed results, statistical analysis, equivalence tests, and the result summary.  
The following quality attributes were investigated, partially by orthogonal analytical methods: Intact 
mass, primary and secondary structure, teriparatide content, charge variants, related substances by 
RP-HPLC and SEC, metacresol content, and biological activity (cell-based assays and binding kinetics). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
The analytical data provided support analytical similarity. Precursor-related impurities are present at 
very low levels, not jeopardising analytical similarity.   
As regards pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparability in the pivotal study PTH/CT1-002/R5, 
the 90% CIs as well as the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the primary PK parameters 
AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax and the secondary PD parameters (ionised calcium) AUC0-t and Cmax were 
within the predefined acceptance limits.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Teriparatide used for Kauliv is expressed as fusion protein with a tag. The tag impurity can potentially 
pose a increased risk for immunogenicity. However, the Applicant presented data confirming that the 
amount of precursor is controlled at very low levels. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
From a quality point of view, analytical similarity can be concluded; data have been presented 
confirming that the precursor that might pose a risk for increased immunogenicity of the biosimilar 
product is controlled at very low levels.   
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Biosimilarity has been established for Kauliv to the reference product Forsteo, as such this applies to 
all indications licensed for Forsteo. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
None 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, biosimilarity of Kauliv to reference product Forsteo and 
therefore a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded.

4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Kauliv is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Kauliv is indicated in adults. 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see 
section 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1).
